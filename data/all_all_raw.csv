<p>Aristotle is credited with the proverb ""One swallow does not make a summer."" In nature, the arrival of these migratory birds often announces the change of seasons, a universal symbol of renewal and hope. Yet it is only when many take flight that the true warmth of summer begins. The same can happen in architecture: an isolated project, however exemplary, rarely changes a reality on its own. When, however, a work teaches, inspires, and can be replicated, it becomes the harbinger of something greater.</p>",

The topography presented both a design challenge and an opportunity to craft a home that integrates naturally with the contours of the land. While the site lacked naturally level platforms, strategic site grading was employed to create two distinct ground levels for construction. The careful placement of two building blocks minimized cut-and-fill operations and reduced the need for extensive retaining structures, allowing the built form to nestle into the landscape with minimal disturbance.</p>",

Source: Filipe Nzongo (2025)</figcaption></figure><p>Being a designer has always been synonymous with being creative, transforming abstract and complex ideas into concrete solutions. However, in recent years, many professionals have been losing this creative spark, and with it, the very essence of the profession. We’ve witnessed an exponential growth of artificial intelligence tools within the creative industry. This, in itself, isn’t a problem; the real risk lies in becoming dependent on these tools.</p><p>Abandoning your own creative capacity and relying on AI to generate design concepts or evaluate solutions is a mistake that can compromise your professional autonomy and creative confidence.</p><p>In this article, I want to discuss why you shouldn’t rely solely on artificial intelligence tools, but instead focus on building your intellectual foundation as a designer. This foundation develops through both theoretical study and consistent practice in real projects; over time, it becomes the cornerstone of your <a href=""https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-51038-1_36"">repertoire and professional competence</a>.</p><h3>How to build knowledge in design</h3><p>Before discussing knowledge in design, it’s important to first understand what knowledge actually is. According to the dictionary, knowledge is the act of knowing or the state of being aware of something, whether through reason or experience. This definition highlights three central elements that deserve attention:</p><ul><li><strong>Act of knowing:</strong> understanding a phenomenon — knowing what it is, how it works, and why it works in a certain way.</li><li><strong>Through reason:</strong> acquiring knowledge through reflection, study, and theory.</li><li><strong>Through experience:</strong> referring to tacit knowledge, which is built over time through practice and observation of reality.</li></ul><p>When we bring this definition into the field of design, <a href=""https://dl.designresearchsociety.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2267&amp;context=drs-conference-papers"">knowledge in design</a> means mastering the principles, philosophies, methods, and practices that help us to solve problems in a structured and creative way.</p><blockquote>In the context of interaction design or digital product design, the nature of this knowledge is particularly complex. There is no universal list of skills that defines a good designer.</blockquote><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/68e9c90252b3"">André Grilo, Ph.D.</a> (2023), addresses this issue in his <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379221346_Competencias_em_Experiencia_do_Usuario_no_Design_de_Produto_Digital"">doctoral thesis</a> when discussing the competencies of digital product designers. According to Grilo, the field still lacks consensus on which knowledge is essential, precisely because the discipline continues to evolve.</p><p>Even so, companies set expectations, anticipating that designers will perform certain activities and deliver specific results, which is often mistaken for actual professional knowledge.</p><p>This is where we need to be careful: a job description is not synonymous with knowledge. A job description talks about tasks; knowledge concerns the judgment, understanding, and autonomy required to execute those tasks with insight. As Grilo (2023, p.94) points out:</p><blockquote><strong>“There are some epistemological issues in UX Design (UXD) that, in my view, are unavoidable in this theoretical discussion. The first concerns the scope of UX Design, due to its wide range of responsibilities. The second revolves around the relationship of UX with diffuse problems. The third relates to the specificity of User Experience as a construct within the theory of Digital Product Design.”</strong></blockquote><p>Several authors have attempted to define what interaction design and UX are, as well as how the discipline is organized, including Garrett (2001), Saffer (2006), and Six (2010). However, most focus on describing the discipline and its connections with other fields, without clearly specifying the types of knowledge a UX designer must master to excel in their practice.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the famous diagram by <a href=""https://medium.com/u/534e55e898c0"">Dan Saffer</a> (2008). While it is useful for visualizing the intersections and scope of the discipline, the diagram by itself does not reveal anything about the types of knowledge and competencies required for the practice of an interaction designer or a UX designer.</p><figure><img alt=""The image illustrates the disciplines and interdisciplinary connections within UX design"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*lPHCuGVD-NU8jxal.jpg"" /><figcaption>Disciplines and Interdisciplinarity in UX. Source: Dan Saffer (2008)</figcaption></figure><p>It is common for designers to feel confused when it comes to professional competencies and skills. The question often arises: Should I know everything about visual design? human factors or usability engineering? This confusion is natural when there is no clear competency model to guide professional development in the field.</p><p>Sometimes, designers wonder which skills are truly necessary to work as an interaction designer or UX designer. There was a time when mastering tools like Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, and Flash was enough to be considered a competent interaction designer or web designer. That period produced many excellent software operators, but not all of them were truly designers.</p><p>When many of these professionals were questioned about their design decisions, there was often surprise or even responses like: “Why do you want to know how I did it?” There has always been a certain mystery surrounding designers’ decisions. I believe this is, in part, one of the reasons why our relationship with other professionals, such as developers, has historically been complicated.</p><p>Being unable to justify a design decision is as incoherent as hearing a surgeon, when questioned about a decision during surgery, say that they don’t know or cannot explain. Yet, it is still common to find designers who cannot articulate the reasoning behind their actions, a clear sign of a lack of reflection and professional maturity.</p><p>Being a designer goes beyond knowing how to use tools. The new generation needs to be careful not to fall into the same trap, now fueled by the use of artificial intelligence. The risk is producing professionals who master prompt engineering but do not truly understand the problems they are solving.</p><p>Building knowledge in design requires practice, reflection, and purpose. I personally developed my competence by working directly in the discipline, learning from projects, mistakes, and discoveries, rather than relying on tools. A designer needs to know how to do something and, above all, know why they are doing it that way.</p><p>Every design decision needs to be intentional, never vague or accidental. Design is, by nature, an act of choice, and every choice reveals an intention, whether conscious or not. As I discussed in my article <strong>“</strong><a href=""https://brasil.uxdesign.cc/quando-a-intencao-orienta-o-design-3c603728254f""><strong>When intention drives design</strong></a><strong>”</strong>, designing without intention is like navigating without a compass: you may reach somewhere, but it is unlikely to be the right destination.</p><blockquote>Intentionality is what distinguishes the designer as an author from the designer as an operator. The former creates meaning; the latter merely executes commands.</blockquote><p>Therefore, to build knowledge in design, designers need to understand which competencies they need to develop. Theory can be useful for this, helping to cultivate what Schön calls <a href=""https://libguides.hull.ac.uk/reflectivewriting/schon"">reflection-in-action</a>, <a href=""https://libguides.hull.ac.uk/reflectivewriting/schon"">reflection on action</a>, and <a href=""https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1390&amp;context=eandc"">knowledge-in-action.</a></p><p>However, designers must not forget to apply their knowledge in practice, as this is the ground where understanding is validated and transformed. It is through practice that new theories emerge, new solutions are tested, and the designer truly becomes a reflective practitioner and creator of knowledge.</p><h3><strong>Types of knowledge in design</strong></h3><p>The types of knowledge in design vary greatly, depending on the professional’s experience and the context in which they work. For instance, a digital product designer working in the finance sector will have different competencies from someone working in healthcare, dealing with domain-specific challenges, regulations, and user expectations.</p><p>In the finance sector, there are mandatory trainings related to anti-money laundering, as well as regulations from the central bank, that drive the development of financial software, knowledge that a designer in the healthcare sector may not possess or need. Additionally, the design standards and UX practices applied in each sector are also completely distinct.</p><p>If we analyze the <a href=""https://elizabethbacon.com/the-ux-sundial-model-iterated-now-including-a-0/"">UX competencies</a> proposed by Elizabeth Bacon (2009), we notice a generalization that does not always reflect the reality of the designer. What the professional should know to move beyond tool proficiency and build true intellectual and creative depth.</p><figure><img alt=""The image illustrates the field of User Experience (UX)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/0*pUzMClic7_e2daTC.png"" /><figcaption>Field of User Experience. Source: Elizabeth Bacon (2009)</figcaption></figure><p>In the model, disciplines such as information architecture, service design, and interaction design are treated collectively, as if they shared the same set of knowledge. In practice, each of these areas has distinct philosophies, principles, and methods. Evaluating a designer’s knowledge based on such a generalized model can be problematic.</p><p>This reflection reinforces the need for each designer to build their own repertoire and develop critical judgment, adapting their knowledge to the real demands of the context in which they work, rather than relying solely on theoretical models. What will differentiate you from the majority is not following generic standards, but the unique knowledge that only you possess.</p><p>To explore this topic further, I recommend reading my article <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/becoming-good-at-something-619c1a61e924""><strong><em>“Becoming Good at Something”</em>.</strong></a></p><h3>The knowledge development model</h3><p>Considering the complexity involved in defining the types of knowledge a designer should possess, I propose that knowledge development in design should be structured into three levels: <strong>declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge, and reflective knowledge.</strong></p><p>This approach applies regardless of whether the professional works as an interaction designer, service designer, or industrial designer.</p><figure><img alt=""The image illustrates the knowledge model proposed by Filipe Nzongo."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AkNv8j4DyEYLAmw5Yyz9Sg.png"" /><figcaption>Knowledge model. Source: Filipe Nzongo (2025)</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Declarative knowledge (knowing what)</strong></h3><p>Declarative knowledge refers to the factual information an individual possesses, including both general and specific knowledge about their environment. <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43546-022-00402-3"">Ahmet Demir <em>et al.</em> (2022)</a> explain that declarative knowledge relates to an individual’s understanding and intentions, which are crucial for problem-solving and decision-making.</p><blockquote>In other words, declarative knowledge is connected to the process of learning and recalling information that one already knows.</blockquote><p>Wikipedia provides a broader definition:</p><blockquote><strong>“Declarative knowledge is the awareness of facts that can be expressed through declarative sentences. It is also called theoretical knowledge, descriptive knowledge, propositional knowledge, or knowledge-that. It is not restricted to a specific use or purpose and can be stored in books or computers.”</strong></blockquote><p>In my model, I start with declarative knowledge because it establishes the foundation upon which all other learning in design is built. If you want to work as an interaction designer, service designer, or information designer, it is essential to understand the fundamental principles of the discipline, such as typography, visual hierarchy, information architecture, usability heuristics, user-centered design, and so on.</p><p>This type of knowledge is crucial because it enables designers to understand the foundations of their discipline before advancing to specific skills, such as prototyping techniques or the use of generative AI tools. Without this foundation, any practice or decision risks being superficial or disconnected from the critical reasoning necessary to solve complex design problems.</p><p>In declarative knowledge, the focus is on understanding theory. For example, knowing that Jakob Nielsen and Rolf Molich created the 10 usability heuristics in 1990 for evaluating interactive products, or understanding what the <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/two-ux-gulfs-evaluation-execution/"">gulfs of execution and evaluation</a> are and their purpose in interface evaluation.</p><p>Furthermore, declarative knowledge serves as a reference for procedural knowledge (knowing how to perform tasks) and reflective knowledge (understanding why a design decision works or fails). It is the starting point for building repertoire and autonomy: knowing what allows the designer to understand the rules of the game before playing it creatively and strategically.</p><h3><strong>Procedural knowledge (Knowing how)</strong></h3><p>Procedural refers to knowledge that depends on a process, rules, or steps. According to <a href=""https://books.google.no/books/about/The_First_person_Point_of_View.html?id=-s7eoQEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y"">Wolfgang Carl (2014)</a>, procedural knowledge, also called know-how or practical knowledge, is the type of knowledge that manifests in the ability to perform actions effectively, sometimes referred to as imperative or performative knowledge.</p><blockquote><strong>This is the second level of knowledge a designer needs to develop. The model is flexible and can be adapted to any design discipline, serving as a guide to structure learning, practice, and professional development.</strong></blockquote><p>In interaction design or digital product design, this knowledge is reflected in a designer’s ability to carry out concrete tasks, such as conducting a heuristic evaluation, designing user interfaces, prototyping, or organizing navigation flows. In other words, it is not enough to know the theory; one must know how to apply it in practice and demonstrate tangible results.</p><p>There is a fusion between knowing what (declarative knowledge) and knowing how (procedural knowledge), and it is precisely this combination that makes all the difference in a designer’s career. A professional who only masters the theory may understand concepts but will not be able to transform that knowledge into concrete solutions.</p><p>Let’s observe the sketch below, which I created as a simple concept to illustrate the importance of having both declarative and procedural knowledge. When a designer receives a sketch like this from a product manager or design director, they must be able to translate the conceptual idea into a real, functional design.</p><p>However, this transformation requires the designer to have strong declarative knowledge, in other words, a solid grasp of the theory that guides the design process. Being able to translate this sketch into a coherent, consistent, and aesthetically pleasing interface is what separates a professional from an amateur.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows a user interface concept sketch for an e-commerce checkout."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iov5AtXIeY6CeXz8u0KeWQ.png"" /><figcaption>User Interface concept for E-commerce. Source: Filipe Nzongo (2018)</figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, procedural knowledge complements this process by enabling the designer to execute the translation effectively, choosing the right <a href=""https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/grid-layout-design-history-tips-and-best-examples"">visual hierarchy, layout structure</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_design_pattern"">interaction patterns</a>, and <a href=""https://improvement.stanford.edu/resources/usability-principles"">usability principles</a> to bring the concept to life. It’s not only about knowing what should be done, but also how to do it in a way that preserves both functionality and aesthetic integrity.</p><p>In practice, this means understanding how each design decision affects user perception and behavior, for instance, where to place primary actions or how to balance visual weight. These are not random choices; they emerge from a deep understanding of <a href=""https://dovetail.com/product-development/human-computer-interaction/"">HCI principles</a> and accumulated experience through continuous reflection and iteration.</p><p>Ultimately, the ability to move from concept to execution, grounded in both theoretical and practical knowledge, is what defines true design mastery.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows a user interface concept for an e-commerce checkout."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_o7AlwYIRI_V0cgklhWvxw.png"" /><figcaption>User Interface concept for E-commerce. Source: Filipe Nzongo (2018)</figcaption></figure><p>The concept above encapsulates several design principles, such as <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/chunking/"">chunking</a>, where information is divided into clear, logical sections; <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles?srsltid=AfmBOoqWJmStmoUZ-85rWbwVkVpfVIiBBSNFcbYNlrIr0FqiSThc9iOV"">Gestalt principles</a>, where related elements are positioned close to one another; and contrast, achieved through the use of <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/visual-hierarchy-ux-definition/"">visual hierarchy</a> to guide the user’s eye. I also applied alignment to create order and readability, and <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/the-power-of-white-space?srsltid=AfmBOophvmeT4OhmzUA4AXQ7OPiDZioAFQb3h6bbLcgHlm8YZ7vdEiCI"">white space to reduce visual clutter, improve legibility</a>, and allow the eyes to rest during scanning.</p><p>Additionally, the design adheres to good practices from Nielsen’s usability heuristics, such as prioritizing <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/recognition-and-recall/"">recognition over<em> recall</em></a>. For instance, using logos (“FedEx,” “UPS,” “Sedex” etc.) instead of plain text makes it easier for users to recognize and select an option quickly.</p><blockquote>An interface is never just a simple arrangement of elements; it embodies a series of reflections and intentional decisions made by the designer to make it what it is.</blockquote><p>Through this example, I aim to demonstrate that being a designer extends far beyond knowing how to operate tools; it’s about understanding the rationale behind every design decision and the purpose of the proposed solution.</p><h3><strong>Reflective knowledge (Knowing why)</strong></h3><p>Reflective knowledge is the ability to understand why we are approaching a design problem in a certain way. It goes beyond knowing what (declarative) and knowing how (procedural); it involves understanding the reasons behind choices, anticipating consequences, and adjusting decisions based on context and experience.</p><p>Donald Schön calls this <a href=""https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1390&amp;context=eandc"">reflection-in-action</a>, which is real-time thinking during the execution of a task, when the designer observes, adjusts, and decides while acting on the problem. He also describes reflection-on-action, which is the retrospective analysis of what happened after the action, allowing one to learn from experience and improve future design decisions.</p><p>In the design context, professionals are constantly alternating between these two modes of reflection. When testing an interface, for example, a designer immediately evaluates the impact of a change (reflection-in-action) and later revisits the process to understand what worked or didn’t, and why (reflection-on-action).</p><p>This continuous cycle builds repertoire, strengthens critical judgment, and enables designers to make informed decisions without relying exclusively on external tools, such as AI.</p><h3><strong>AI is an ally, not a substitute</strong></h3><p>Artificial Intelligence has become a widely discussed topic among designers. Yet, the question that arises most often is: <strong>Will we be replaced?</strong> It’s still too early to give a definitive answer.</p><p>Although the exponential growth of generative AI worries many designers, it’s important to emphasize that it is an ally, not a replacement for human competence. We still master our craft. This isn’t the first time designers have faced new technologies, and adaptation has always been part of the discipline’s natural evolution.</p><p>When I say AI is an ally, I mean it can be great for accelerating repetitive tasks, organizing information, or generating initial design alternatives — but it doesn’t guarantee creativity or critical judgment.</p><blockquote>A designer’s judgment is grounded in declarative, procedural, and reflective knowledge — the foundation of their professional repertoire.</blockquote><p>This repertoire enables designers to perceive nuances, prioritize problems, and propose appropriate interventions. AI, no matter how advanced, lacks this repertoire: it doesn’t <em>see</em> the interface the way you do, nor does it understand the intention behind your design choices.</p><p>In my article <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-can-humans-and-intelligent-computers-work-together-d349328ce270""><strong>How can humans and computers work together</strong></a>, I discuss how our relationship with intelligent machines should be one of mutual support, not dependence.</p><p>What new-generation designers must be careful about is becoming overly dependent on AI. My appeal to designers is this: let’s not outsource our cognitive capacity. <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/15/1/6"">Research shows that excessive reliance on AI can lead to dependency and a reduction in cognitive ability.</a> Moderation is always essential.</p><p>In the past, when I worked as a graphic designer, even though there were plenty of websites offering graphic bundles and mockups, I made a point of creating my own. For a simple reason: knowing how to make something is better than just using something ready-made. Moreover, creating your own assets helps you stand out; it’s what builds repertoire, practical skills, and professional identity.</p><p>For digital product designers, for example, AI can generate a list of applicable heuristics, but it’s up to you, the designer, to actually evaluate the interface: to identify which heuristics have been violated, which have not been met, and from there, propose solutions to address the interface’s problems.</p><p>Without the kinds of knowledge I described earlier, you won’t be able to spot flaws, let alone suggest improvements, much like trying to judge a case without knowing the laws that govern it.</p><p>Learn to evaluate an interface like a specialist. That’s what allows you to grow as a professional and develop practical, <a href=""https://design-instability.com/tacit-knowledge-and-skills"">tacit knowledge</a>. A designer must be capable of tackling the problem in front of them, not through external tools, but through the knowledge developed over years of study and practice.</p><p>Your intellectual repertoire grows through practice, study, and reflection. Every interface you evaluate, every prototype you test, every design decision you discuss with peers, all of it contributes to building your judgment. This accumulation of experience is what turns information into applicable knowledge, not just data that can be fed into a machine.</p><p>A designer cannot expect AI to do everything for them. They must build their knowledge through study and hands-on experience — collaborating with other professionals, both more and less experienced. Use AI as your creative ally, not your crutch.</p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>To conclude, the message I want to leave for designers is that, in the age of AI, what will truly set you apart in an increasingly competitive market is your intellectual capacity. Building knowledge is more important than mastering tools. New technologies come and go, but knowledge remains. Knowing how to create, thinking critically, and reflecting on your own work are values no one can take away from you.</p><p>What distinguishes an excellent designer from an amateur is not the speed of delivery, but the ability to create projects aligned with both user and business goals, combined with solid technical mastery.</p><p>That’s why you should prioritize building knowledge in design: study, practice, and talk to people who know more than you. Mastering a tool doesn’t make you a designer. Next, learn to identify what you don’t know yet, map your knowledge gaps, and work to fill them with new skills that will drive your professional growth.</p><p>Finally, understand that AI is an ally, not a substitute for human competence. Use it as support, but maintain your ability to think, create, and decide for yourself. Developing creative autonomy is what will ensure you remain relevant, with or without the tools of the moment.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=aaec674d5532"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/hey-designer-do-you-know-what-you-are-doing-aaec674d5532"">Hey designer, do you know what you are doing?</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

It’s as if I’m sitting at the bedside of a dying loved one, dreading the moment they’ll no longer be with us.</p><p>Design isn’t a person, per se, but for many of us it is — or was — a meaningful part of our lives. And the notion that design, as we know it, may wither feels almost certain.</p><p>My main prediction has been that AI will become so ubiquitous and efficient it will absorb nearly every experience that once required traditional design as a mediator.</p><p>This isn’t a doom-and-gloom prediction — it’s a <a href=""https://jakobnielsenphd.substack.com/p/no-more-ui"">rational conclusion</a> drawn from the current trajectory of the industry and what highly respected professionals have also expressed.</p><blockquote>I am becoming more convinced that this [the shift toward users interacting with their agents rather than websites] will mark the end of user interface design as we know it.</blockquote><blockquote>—<a href=""https://jakobnielsenphd.substack.com/p/no-more-ui"">Jakob Nielsen, co-founder of Nielsen Norman Group</a></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, this does not bode well for those just entering the design field. Especially for designers with hopes of creating and building in the same way many of us were once fortunate to be part of.</p><p>However, despite all the negative commentary and predictions surrounding AI, I often witness a naïve optimism among students and junior designers — a kind of defense mechanism that shields them from the harsher realities of the field.</p><p>And maybe that’s exactly why new designers are so vital right now. Their hope is born of ignorance — and I don’t mean that negatively. I mean ignorance in the way that fosters curiosity and openness to possibility. And that’s precisely what the industry needs.</p><p>Maybe people like me are too cynical, too rational, too caught up in how the world works today to see a different path. But if there’s one truth about humans it’s that we’re anything but rational creatures.</p><p>In fact, a disregard for conventional wisdom — especially in young minds — can open a doorway to new ideas.</p><p>They say <a href=""https://www.ideatovalue.com/crea/nickskillicorn/2023/06/evidence-that-children-are-more-creative-than-adults-and-the-opposite/"">children are more creative than adults</a> because they are not tethered by rules and restraints. Even in <a href=""https://updevelopment.org/3-metamorphoses-nietzsches-map-human-growth/"">Nietzsche’s metamorphosis</a>, the final stage of transformation is to a child—representing the ability to experience the world with fresh eyes — unchained by the cultural “thou shalt” directives we’re fed.</p><p>So perhaps there is hope for design, and by extension, designers.</p><p>Perhaps I’m too jaded, too overconfident in believing that if someone like me cannot see the path, then no path exists.</p><p>Maybe instead of thinking it is the end of design, we have faith that those who still dream will pave the way for something new — design that transcends anything we can imagine now.</p><p>It’s time we — I — stop pretending to predict and instead encourage those who will shape a future we want to live in, in ways we have yet to imagine.</p><p>And it begins with humility — with accepting our limitations.

It’s the craft of shaping written language into a visual experience — how words look, breathe, and interact on a page or screen. Good typography quietly guides the reader, while poor typography shouts for attention in all the wrong ways. Every detail — from letter spacing to line height — affects how users read, feel, and engage. Let’s unpack the essentials.</p><p>Every letter has a structure, and understanding it helps you design with precision. Terms like <em>ascender</em>, <em>descender</em>, <em>baseline</em>, and <em>x-height</em> describe the invisible skeleton that keeps type coherent. The x-height, for instance, determines how big a typeface feels even at the same point size.</p><p>Serif and sans-serif typefaces differ in tone partly because of these structures: serifs guide the eye along lines of text, while sans-serifs often feel cleaner and more modern. Knowing anatomy allows you to mix typefaces consciously rather than by vibe alone.</p><h3>Typographic Anatomy</h3><figure><img alt=""A large black uppercase ‘X’ is shown with orange dashed lines illustrating its body width and x-height. The baseline and measurement labels mark the height and width of the character, explaining fundamental proportions of type."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*0aiFcVswjKru5KVc.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Lowercase letters ‘p’ and ‘d’ are displayed with orange dashed lines showing ascender and descender zones. The diagram labels the ascender, descender, baseline, and corresponding lines, illustrating vertical type structure."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*CdI0MEs1sVfLDBG2.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Three uppercase letters ’N’, ‘B’, and ‘E’ highlight typographic parts. The ’N’ marks its serif, the ‘B’ highlights its bowl, and the ‘E’ identifies the arm and stem, with orange accents emphasizing each feature."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*oF2wPhhxGqeyvnoI.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Image 4 — Parts and shapes of type: Ear, Spine, and ShoulderLowercase ‘g’, ‘S’, and ‘m’ illustrate three distinct components of type. The ear of the ‘g’, the curved spine of the ‘S’, and the shoulder of the ‘m’ are all highlighted in orange."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*VnIXaIKRX2F4UltN.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Letters ‘A’, ‘f’, and ‘e’ are displayed to show horizontal structural features.

The ‘g’ shows the link and loop connection, while ‘A’ and ‘M’ emphasize their apex points at the top of each letter."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*PuMyeEggDK0CyREp.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Two sets of lowercase ‘a’ and ‘g’ letters compare single-story and double-story designs. The left side shows geometric single-story forms, while the right side shows traditional double-story shapes used in many serif typefaces."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*6rCySVJcme6QkNQ0.png"" /></figure><h3>Kerning, tracking, leading</h3><p>These three terms define the rhythm and flow of text. <em>Kerning</em> adjusts the space between individual letters, <em>tracking</em> controls spacing across whole words or paragraphs, and <em>leading</em> (pronounced “ledding”) sets the space between lines.</p><p>Think of them as the breathing room of type. Too tight, and words feel suffocating; too loose, and they drift apart like strangers at a party. Consistent, intentional spacing is one of the clearest markers of professional typography — and one of the easiest to overlook.</p><figure><img alt=""Image 1 — Kerning: Distance between lettersThe heading ‘Kerning’ appears above the phrase ‘Distance between letters.’ Two examples of the lowercase word ‘hi’ are displayed: one with normal spacing and one with increased space between the letters. A double-headed arrow labeled ‘In Figma, they call it “Letter spacing”’ illustrates the spacing difference."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*exdHrDfswchfkbUW.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Tracking’ is followed by the description ‘an overall adjustment of space applied equally to a word, a line, or a passage of text.’ Two blocks of lorem ipsum text show the difference between normal tracking and wide tracking.

An arrow labeled ‘In Figma, they call it “Line Height”’ connects the two examples."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*1SA6s7oIc-lxMu71.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Widow’ appears with the description ‘a word hanging out at the end of a paragraph.’ Two side-by-side text blocks show examples: the left one has a single word (‘ultrices’) isolated at the end, marked with an orange oval and a label ‘widow,’ while the right one shows the corrected version. A red cross and green checkmark highlight incorrect and correct formatting."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*vxfPSLbCG52lX1Uj.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Orphan’ appears with the description ‘a word or part of a word at the top of a column.’ Two text columns are displayed. The left column contains a paragraph ending mid-column, and the right column begins with an isolated short word (‘id.’) marked with an orange circle and a label ‘orphan,’ demonstrating improper text flow."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*rJOBFClNu8ioQXFr.png"" /></figure><h3>Type alignment</h3><p>Left, right, center, or justified — each alignment changes how the reader experiences text. Left-aligned text feels natural for most Western readers; it mirrors how our eyes expect to move. Centered text adds elegance in small doses, like headings or invitations, but strains readability in long paragraphs.</p><p>Justified text can look neat but often introduces awkward gaps between words. There’s no one right choice — only what fits the tone and purpose of the content.</p><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Flush left, rag right’ introduces a layout example where text is aligned to the left margin and uneven on the right. The left block of lorem ipsum text is labeled ‘flush left’ with an orange arrow pointing downward and a note saying ‘rag right.’ On the right, a warning icon appears beside text explaining that this style is preferred in Western countries because people read from left to right."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*dOSLzL-Wlw7S3k0r.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Flush right, rag left’ introduces a layout where text is aligned to the right and uneven on the left. The lorem ipsum text is labeled ‘rag right’ with an orange outline marking the uneven edge and an arrow labeled ‘flush left’ at the bottom. On the right, a warning icon and note indicate that flush-right text is not ideal for long passages because the eye struggles to find the next line."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*aWYF12QNYPjUAxRV.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Justified’ is followed by an example paragraph where all text lines are aligned evenly on both sides. An orange arrow and curly brackets highlight uniform alignment and mention that ‘all lines are the same length and the margins are even.’ To the right, text reads ‘Sometimes, justified texts create rivers of space. That is not good,’ warning against uneven gaps that can occur."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*G7iQYhBI0QcuBuM6.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Centered’ introduces text aligned along the center axis. A block of lorem ipsum text is centered on the left, while on the right, a yellow warning triangle with text explains that centered text is not suitable for long reading because the eye loses its place easily."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*F2Bb_YwA_2YglpBY.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Random / Asymmetrical / Mixed’ shows multiple short lines of lorem ipsum text arranged irregularly, without consistent alignment. On the right, a yellow warning icon and note state, ‘Visually exciting but not good for lengthy reading,’ emphasizing that inconsistent alignment may attract attention but reduce readability."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*kXehgriPbRKHc8Nq.png"" /></figure><h3>Indents, outdents, and hanging punctuations</h3><p>Indenting the first line of a paragraph subtly signals a new thought, while outdents (negative indents) can highlight lists or quotes. Hanging punctuation, where quotation marks or bullets sit outside the text block, preserves clean visual alignment.</p><p>These are the small design manners that readers might never notice — but would feel their absence. They lend rhythm and grace to long-form content.</p><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Indent’ appears above a paragraph of lorem ipsum text on the left, where the first line begins slightly inward to demonstrate indentation. An orange arrow highlights the starting position. On the right, a screenshot labeled ‘HOW TO’ shows a Figma settings panel with ‘Paragraph Indent: 25’ under ‘Type Details,’ illustrating where indentation can be adjusted."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*e9r5Yx3qlJZDgP0k.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Outdent’ introduces an example with multiple lorem ipsum paragraphs. Each line begins with an orange arrow pointing left, showing that the first line extends outside the normal text margin. On the right, a yellow warning triangle is accompanied by text that reads, ‘Unsure if a setting in Figma can do this. It is not commonly used in layouts,’ noting that outdents are rare."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*DX14YOE29B7Y3rsR.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Hanging punctuation’ is shown above justified lorem ipsum text with punctuation marks slightly extending beyond the right margin. Orange arrows and lines highlight the overhanging characters, with text that reads, ‘Extend beyond the edge of the justified text.’ Below, a yellow warning icon explains that this maintains the optical alignment of the column, and smaller text lists examples like quotes, apostrophes, hyphens, commas, and periods."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*X8YreWiBAJDQX5o3.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Hanging punctuation’ appears again, with a paragraph of justified text where punctuation is kept within the alignment boundary. Orange arrows indicate no extension beyond the edge, with a note saying, ‘No need to extend beyond the edge of the justified text.’ A warning icon below clarifies that larger punctuation marks such as question marks, colons, and parentheses should remain aligned."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*-lrNE26bhFlujCrc.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The left section labeled ‘Prime marks’ displays the contraction ‘I’m’ using incorrect straight marks, with a circled area highlighting the prime mark above the ‘I.’ Below it, an example reads ‘His height is 5’-9&quot;.’ The right section labeled ‘Apostrophe’ shows the correct curved apostrophe in ‘I’m,’ highlighted by a circle, with an example sentence below: ‘He said, “I am a designer.”’"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*GFA93aD7_v8U2roR.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Letters &amp; strokes’ presents two large letter ‘Q’ examples. On the left, a thick-stroked orange ‘Q’ is outlined in black, with a warning icon stating, ‘Letter forms are distorted with very thick stroke. Refrain from doing this.’ On the right, a thinner orange ‘Q’ shows proper stroke weight with a note saying, ‘A thinner stroke is ok.’"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*AuUeVrJ49gfrPrpK.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Stacking type? No!’ introduces an example with vertically arranged words. On the left, uppercase ‘HELLO’ is stacked vertically, and on the right, lowercase ‘hello’ is also stacked. A warning icon and note beside them state, ‘Irregular width of these letters creates a rough edge on both sides of the type,’ illustrating why stacked type reduces readability."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*We6L8G_yOVVw788g.png"" /></figure><h3>Legibility and readability</h3><p>They sound similar but mean different things. <em>Legibility</em> is about how clearly letters can be distinguished — a function of font design, size, and contrast. <em>Readability</em> is about how easy it feels to read longer passages — affected by line length, spacing, and even the surrounding design.</p><p>A beautifully legible font can still be unreadable in practice if the text is too dense or too wide. The goal isn’t just to be seen but to be comfortably followed.</p><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Legibility and readability definition’ appears at the top. Below it, two sentences define the terms: ‘Legibility measures whether the viewer can read the text’ and ‘Readability measures how much the reader wants to read the text,’ with the words can and wants underlined for emphasis."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*y0p20rb87C0p_SW5.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Legibility and readability’ introduces two columns comparing fonts. On the left, text labeled ‘Sans Serif’ is written in a clean sans serif typeface. On the right, text labeled ‘Serif’ uses a serif typeface. A yellow warning icon at the bottom notes: ‘Research has shown that serif is slightly easier to read because of the horizontal serifs which lead the eye forward.’"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*iowm_On0u8Mrlq9q.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Legibility and readability’ appears again. Two columns compare ‘Sans Serif’ and ‘Serif’ text using similar words: ‘infinite, millenium, minimum, lilies.’ A yellow warning icon and note below explain: ‘Serifs provide details which help the eye differentiate between similar letters.’"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*nfl-M75tAoegS8ru.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘How many characters in a line’ appears above a sample paragraph. A numbered scale runs above the text, showing marks at 1, 52, and 70, with the label ‘optimal characters per line’ in orange. A yellow warning icon at the bottom reads, ’28 picas wide * 2.5 = 70 characters,’ indicating an ideal line length for readability."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*n3ZwY3GzZZa8BQjQ.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Text size’ with the subheading ‘generally range between 8–10, sometimes 12 point’ appears at the top. Below are four side-by-side paragraphs of lorem ipsum text labeled ‘8 point,’ ‘9 point,’ ’10 point,’ and ’12 point,’ showing how font size affects readability."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*NUQ6qd5Y0n-SMYRg.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Legibility’ with the subtitle ‘high contrast makes for easy reading’ introduces three colored examples. The left text box has green background with light text; the middle has orange background with light text — both marked with yellow warning icons reading ‘colorizing the text, or darkening the background will make it hard to read the text.’ The right box shows black text on white background with a green check icon and note: ‘When unsure, white background and black text is the way t"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*1Xa_ClFi25BeDvh1.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Drop caps’ with the subtitle ‘draw the readers eyes’ appears above an example paragraph starting with a large decorative ‘L’ drop cap. An orange arrow points right to a yellow warning icon and note: ‘Drop caps and opening paragraphs are opportunities to capture the reader’s attention and motivate them to read on.’"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*qhYcLqKz1L6dVReM.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Typographic abominations’ with the subtitle ‘please don’t do these’ introduces three text examples of ‘I am Baskerville.’ The first, outlined in green, shows proper proportions labeled ‘Normal, without distortion.’ The second, slightly compressed, has an orange arrow and a red X with text ‘Don’t squash the letters.’ The third, stretched horizontally, has a red X and the note ‘Don’t stretch the letters.’"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Tt7RZmaHzN2KEKn1.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Contrast’ shows two blocks of text.

In UI design, type must perform at small sizes and varying screens. In print, it must hold character at high resolutions and long durations.</p><p>Display type can afford drama; body text should feel invisible. Understanding how context shapes your typographic decisions is what separates art from noise.</p><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Lining numbers’ with subtitle ‘some fonts have numbers that are all the same height’ appears above two rows of numerals from 1 to 0. Both rows are enclosed in dashed boxes with equal height indicators, showing that all digits align at the top and bottom, demonstrating uniform height in lining figures."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*L3610UrnIFrxWd56.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Oldstyle numbers’ with subtitle ‘some fonts have numbers that have different heights and baselines’ appears above a single row of numerals 1 to 0.

Once you see how subtle its impact is, you start noticing type everywhere: on screens, in streets, on receipts. Every font choice tells a story. The more fluently you speak the language of type, the more precisely you can design experiences that speak back.</p><p>Typography has a strange power: it’s both invisible and unforgettable. The best type never demands your attention, yet it defines how every word feels. A letter’s curve can suggest warmth or precision, while spacing can create calm or urgency. This is why typography sits at the heart of design — connecting language with emotion.</p><p>So when we adjust a line height or choose between Helvetica and Garamond, we’re not just picking styles; we’re shaping how people interpret meaning. Typography is the quiet storyteller behind every interface, poster, and page.

When conversations become the new interface and tools can appear contextually, how should we design the flow, timing, and handoff between chat and visual elements?</p><h3>Evolution from plugins, MCP, to SDK</h3><p>To understand what this shift truly means for design, we first need to look at how the system evolved.</p><p>In the early days of plugins, tools lived in separate spaces. Users had to switch between apps, browser extensions, or new tabs to complete even the simplest task.</p><p>Then came the Model Context Protocol, or MCP. It created a standard way for ChatGPT to talk with external tools and data sources. MCP allowed the model to call a tool and pass structured information through a single, consistent channel. It was an invisible bridge between the model and the outside world.</p><p>Building on that foundation, OpenAI introduced the <strong>Apps Software Development Kit (SDK),</strong> a toolkit that makes this bridge visible and interactive. It determines <em>when</em> a tool appears, <em>how</em> it looks, and <em>how</em> people can interact with it directly inside the chat. With the SDK, users can engage directly with apps through buttons, cards, or widgets without leaving the conversation.</p><figure><img alt=""A preview of multiple mobile screens showing third-party apps like Tunedrop, Brick &amp; Basil, and BeatBot running inside ChatGPT’s interface, where users can browse maps, playlists, and restaurant cards directly within the chat window."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Hej5hziRSjflrud8yVOxhw.png"" /><figcaption>Image from OpenAI’s Apps SDK Design Guidelines illustrating how integrated apps visually coexist within ChatGPT’s conversation interface. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/concepts/design-guidelines""><em>OpenAI — Apps SDK Design Guidelines</em></a></figcaption></figure><h3>How the apps SDK boosts efficiency and product growth</h3><p>At this point, designers can probably already imagine how the Apps SDK begins to reshape the user experience. In essence, the SDK embodies the logic behind <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/hick-s-law-making-the-choice-easier-for-users"">Hick’s Law</a> and <a href=""https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/B9780128182024000131"">Fitts’s Law</a>: it reduces the visual noise that slows decision-making and shortens the physical distance between intention and completion.</p><p>Take Coursera for example. Previously, a learner exploring UX courses might spend minutes choosing which platform to open, typing “UX design” into a search bar, scrolling through long lists, and clicking in and out of pages to check ratings or instructors. Every choice added a moment of hesitation, fragmenting attention and stretching the time it took to act.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Coursera’s University of Michigan portal showing search results for “UX design,” with multiple course cards, filters for subjects and skills, and sorting options that make the interface visually dense and choice-heavy."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Vl6K_9wrgCzci7iXZ_LfcA.png"" /><figcaption>Image from Coursera’s page illustrating how users face a complex, multi-step interface when searching for UX design courses. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://www.coursera.org/programs/university-of-michigan-mrofm/browse?authProvider=umich&amp;query=ux+design&amp;source=search""><em>Coursera — University of Michigan UX Design Search</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>However, Coursera’s integration with ChatGPT illustrates a successful application of Hick’s Law principles, significantly reducing decision complexity. A learner can simply ask a question with natural language inside ChatGPT’s text field. A video preview of relevant courses then appears directly within the chat, reducing the number of immediate choices presented to the learner. Learners no longer needs to spend time filtering or comparing endless options in a long, scrolling list, thereby simplifying the selection process and dramatically decreasing the reaction time required to commit to a course.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot showing a Coursera video playing directly inside ChatGPT, where a user naturally asks follow-up questions about UX design concepts through text conversation, demonstrating seamless course discovery and learning."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Tqh-N6IQS_bT0pK2BbtbLw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Image illustrating how users can search for and explore UX design courses on Coursera directly within ChatGPT using natural language prompts. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/""><em>OpenAI — Introducing Apps in ChatGPT</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Some in-house designers might wonder what is the impact on their products. If users can complete tasks entirely inside ChatGPT, would they still visit the original app?</p><p>This concern is reasonable because the SDK might reduce users’ page-level engagement within the native environment. Yet the same decreased friction of opening the app can also widen the app’s reach. By allowing users to call the app directly within ChatGPT, the SDK raises visit frequency among existing members and opens the door for non-members to try it for the first time.</p><p>The experience no longer depends on downloading, logging in, or navigating to a separate website. Each interaction inside ChatGPT becomes an entry point that can lead to higher engagement and new conversions, expanding the app’s reach without adding extra steps.</p><h3>Designing experiences that belong in a conversation</h3><p>After understanding the broader impact of the Apps SDK, designers can start thinking about how to shape these experiences in practice.</p><p>Designing for the SDK means clearly defining who the users are, what their goals look like in context, and which parts of their workflow feel most natural to complete through conversation. The task must be specific enough for ChatGPT to assist, yet simple enough to avoid overwhelming the interaction.</p><p>OpenAI offers several guiding questions to help designers identify good use cases, each of which can also be viewed through the lens of <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/hick-s-law-making-the-choice-easier-for-users"">Hick’s Law</a>, showing how the SDK minimizes the number of decisions users need to make. Ask yourself:</p><ul><li><em>How do your user task fit naturally into a conversation? (for example, booking, ordering, scheduling, quick lookups)</em></li><li><em>Is it time-bound or action-oriented? (short or medium duration tasks with a clear start and end)</em></li><li><em>Is the information valuable in the moment? (users can act on it right away or get a concise preview before diving deeper)</em></li><li><em>Can it be summarized visually and simply? (one card, a few key details, a clear CTA)</em></li><li><em>Does it extend ChatGPT in a way that feels additive or differentiated?</em></li></ul><p>Designers should also avoid designing interfaces that:</p><ul><li><em>Display long-form or static content better suited for a website or app.</em></li><li><em>Require complex multi-step workflows that exceed the inline or fullscreen display modes.</em></li><li><em>Use the space for ads, upsells, or irrelevant messaging.</em></li><li><em>Surface sensitive or private information directly in a card where others might see it.</em></li><li><em>Duplicate ChatGPT’s system functions (for example, recreating the input composer).</em></li></ul><p>From most of these principles, we can notice that OpenAI encourages designers to <strong>avoid tasks that involve too many steps</strong>, or think about what <strong>information is valuable</strong> to show on the interface.</p><p>Take Figma SDK for example. The workflows like converting a short piece of text into a user flow represents a much stronger use case. It is easier for users to describe with natural language, and this information can immediate be summarized into visual feedback that users can act on right away.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot showing a user asking ChatGPT to convert a hand-drawn user-flow sketch into a digital diagram using the Figma app, with the finished flowchart displayed directly within the chat interface."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2LIxFdzjGAmW0XgFWsv2ew.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Image demonstrating how users can generate a complete user-flow diagram in Figma through a simple natural-language request and sketches inside ChatGPT. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/""><em>OpenAI — Introducing Apps in ChatGPT</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>In contrast, designing a complex design system with ChatGPT may not be a good user case. Because it require both users and computers to access complicate information on multiple design pages, and users have to constantly make fragmented decisions and repeatedly step in to guide the AI, which interrupts the flow of interaction and increases the overall time to complete a task.</p><p>For designers, building for the Apps SDK starts with defining a clear, focused task. ChatGPT favors apps that serve a single, well-scoped purpose, something users can complete in one short interaction. <strong>Try to describe your user’s key goal in plain language, outline its input and output, and make sure it fits naturally into a conversation.</strong></p><h3>Designing Interfaces that belong in a conversation</h3><p>OpenAI also provides a set of UI guidelines that can be examined through the lens of <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/hick-s-law-making-the-choice-easier-for-users"">Hick’s</a> and <a href=""https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/B9780128182024000131"">Fitts’s Law</a>.</p><p>For example, designers should display <strong>only the most relevant information</strong> and present it in a simple visual form, such as a clean card with a short list of three key items.</p><p>The guidelines also suggest limiting each card to a maximum of two primary actions: one main call to action and one optional secondary choice. These approach helps users <strong>find what they need without navigating through layers of menus or dense tables</strong>, allowing them to act more quickly.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration showing four examples of poor interface patterns for ChatGPT Apps SDK — multiple views, deep navigation, redundant features, and vertical scrolling — each marked with a red “X” to highlight unnecessary complexity."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*di-MpBfsMeBYsiC1lUbCeA.png"" /><figcaption>Image from OpenAI’s Apps SDK Design Guidelines emphasizing that ChatGPT app interfaces should avoid complex navigation and redundant elements. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/concepts/design-guidelines""><em>OpenAI — Apps SDK Design Guidelines</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Primary actions are usually placed at the bottom of the card, effectively <strong>reducing the distance the thumb-pointer must travel</strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram showing labeled interface elements within ChatGPT Apps SDK cards, including titles, edit controls, expandable maps, item lists, and primary action buttons like “Directions,” demonstrating structured layout design."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XzRY1Kz1PJX62MTAYGBbuA.png"" /><figcaption>Image from OpenAI’s Apps SDK Design Guidelines illustrating how different UI components are organized consistently within ChatGPT’s in-chat interface. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/concepts/design-guidelines""><em>OpenAI — Apps SDK Design Guidelines</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>When a card contains richer media such as images, maps, or interactive diagrams, the expand option can open a fullscreen view. This action significantly increases the <strong>effective target width</strong>, allowing users to work within a larger, more precise area and improves control when interacting with detailed visual content.</p><figure><img alt=""Two smartphone screens showing full-screen interactions within ChatGPT Apps SDK: one displaying restaurant details for “Little Nona’s” with an image, description, and action buttons, and another showing a map with nearby pizza locations."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*b_Wc5aMX-3LT_ChElOc49Q.png"" /><figcaption>Image from OpenAI’s Apps SDK Design Guidelines demonstrating how full-screen views allow immersive map-interactions directly inside ChatGPT. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/concepts/design-guidelines""><em>OpenAI — Apps SDK Design Guidelines</em></a></figcaption></figure><blockquote>If you’re interested in the details of how to design user experiences and interfaces, please check out the <a href=""https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/concepts/design-guidelines"">Apps SDK Design Guidelines</a> and the <a href=""https://www.figma.com/community/file/1560064615791108827"">Figma component library</a>.</blockquote><h3>The future of agents and UX designer’s role</h3><p>As Brad Lightcap mentioned in his Bloomberg interview, the future of ChatGPT will begin to behave more like an <strong>operating system</strong> (or Jarvis, your personal agent).</p><p>It will not only execute commands but also integrate information across multiple apps, anticipate user needs, and determine when to act and when to ask for confirmation.</p><p>Similar directions are already being explored or developed in products like Gemini and Google Suite products, signaling a shift toward more unified, context-aware environments.</p><p>For UX designers, this evolution expands the scope of design beyond screens and buttons. The focus moves <strong>toward designing flows, contexts, and systems</strong> that help users think clearly and act confidently. Designers must learn to define how an AI communicates, makes decisions, and aligns with human goals.</p><p>Yet no matter how advanced the system becomes, there will always be a need to clarify what people truly need, and bringing that clarity to complexity to just simple interactions.</p><h3>References:</h3><p>Bloomberg Originals.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939826.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p><em>Warning: This story contains graphic details of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2019/10/8643443/15-signs-of-domestic-violence-that-arent-physical"">domestic violence</a>.  </em></p>



<p>I will never forget the night that finally made me leave. My ex-partner and I were at an event with friends. Everything seemed fine until he — as he often did — switched from affectionate to enraged without warning. Throughout the night, he sent me cryptic texts: <em>“I’m watching you. You’ll see what happens when we get home.”</em></p>



<p>The venue was dark and crowded, which allowed him to hide in the shadows. When he finally appeared, I was already in tears. I told him I was done. He grabbed me so tightly I could barely breathe, whispering, “You’ll never leave me.” When I tried to escape, he threw me to the ground and began kicking me—my face, my stomach, my back. I remember praying, <em>“God, please help me get through this.”</em> A friend eventually pulled him off me, and another rushed me outside.</p>



<p>That night, I ran to my sister’s apartment. My best friend joined us, and together they convinced me to call my mother. I didn’t want to; I had been hiding so much from my family, and I knew calling meant going to the hospital and filing a report. I also feared what my ex had always threatened: <em>“If you send me to jail, I’ll kill myself.”</em></p>



<p>When my mom saw my bruised face over FaceTime, she broke down. At the hospital, I was surrounded by police officers and doctors, forced to retell the story again and again. Even then, I tried to protect him—until I learned he and his mother lied to the police, saying I’d fallen down stairs. That betrayal broke something in me. I told the truth. I filed for a restraining order, terrified but determined to protect myself.</p>



<p>When I met him, I was in a vulnerable place and searching for love, something I think now that he sensed. The control and manipulation started subtly—name-calling, jealousy, isolation. I was shocked, yes, but I took it because I convinced myself that he loved me. Then the emotional abuse became physical. I was constantly walking on eggshells, terrified of his next outburst. He would punch walls, throw objects, and then apologize, promising he’d never hurt me again. Like so many survivors, I stayed, believing he could change. I was in a constant state of hope—hope that the man I first met would return, hope that things would go back to “normal.” However, the truth is that there was never anything normal about it.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Domestic violence is not simply isolated or personal; it’s cultural, systemic, and global. It crosses every boundary: race, class, gender, and age.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The abuse only escalated from there. Over time, I became someone I didn’t recognize—isolated, anxious, and ashamed. He would push me against walls, crack drywall, and then threaten to harm himself to pull me back in. I remember breaking down locked doors to stop him from self-harming. Every time I thought of leaving, he’d promise to change—or promise to die.</p>



<p>After that final night, something inside me broke open. I started therapy and eventually found <a href=""https://www.safehorizon.org/"">Safe Horizon</a> through friends and family who told me about the work they do. It was the first time I felt truly ready to speak out.</p>



<p>I learned that my story was not unique, and that’s what makes it so devastating. Domestic violence is not simply isolated or personal; it’s cultural, systemic, and global. It crosses every boundary: race, class, gender, and age. The tactics abusers use are eerily similar: isolation, intimidation, emotional manipulation, and control.</p>







<p>Safe Horizon, the largest victim service nonprofit in the U.S., provides critical resources for survivors of abuse and violent crime. What drew me to them was their inclusive approach—they support survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, sex trafficking, and more. Their <a href=""https://www.safehorizon.org/streetwork/"">Streetwork Project</a> helps young people experiencing homelessness due to abuse, offering food, shelter, medical care, and compassion without judgment. They reach survivors wherever they are, meeting them with dignity and safety.</p>



<p>Too often, young women—especially Black women—don’t feel safe seeking help. We’re told to stay quiet, that no one will believe us, that leaving is pointless. And the question survivors hear most—<em>“Why didn’t you just leave?”</em>—is one of the most harmful. As FKA Twigs bravely shared when <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/arts/music/fka-twigs-shia-labeouf-abuse.html"">speaking about her own experience</a>, that question blames the survivor instead of the perpetrator. Leaving isn’t simple—it’s dangerous. It’s layered with fear, shame, financial dependency, and psychological manipulation. Even after leaving, survivors face systemic challenges: renewing restraining orders, reliving trauma in court, and constantly looking over our shoulders.</p>



<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=5wSrVmPeQSA"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Through Safe Horizon</a>, I found healing, advocacy, and community. The <a href=""https://www.safehorizon.org/about-us/leadership/senior-leadership/"">organization’s leaders</a> like Lisa A. O’Connor and Liz Roberts, create true safety by approaching survivors with empathy, patience, and emotional intelligence. Even small gestures—asking <em>“Do you welcome hugs?”</em>—remind survivors that we have autonomy again.</p>



<p>One of the most profound parts of my healing has been realizing that survival doesn’t mean the pain disappears. It means transforming it. As <a href=""https://grief.com/"">author and grief expert David Kessler wrote</a>, I learned to turn my “pain into purpose”. I use my voice now to help others recognize the signs of abuse before it’s too late. Love should never make you smaller. Real love doesn’t silence, it protects and uplifts.</p>

<p>Calling all fashion lovers because the nineties… and seventies… and sixties called, and they want to be back inside your closets. Luckily, New York-based fashion designer <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/05/11377960/anna-sui-career-collaborations-designers"">Anna Sui</a> was tapped by <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/old-navy-the-occasion-dresses"">Old Navy</a> for its <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/now-trending/anna-sui?cid=3050175&amp;bc=true"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">first-ever designer collaboration</a> — fronted by Y2K-coded singer-songwriter PinkPantheress.<br /><br />“Anna really understands who our customer is, what she wants, how she lives, and we knew this was an amazing moment to bring that,” <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-studio-collection-01-zac-posen"">Zac Posen</a>, creative director of Gap Inc. and chief creative officer of Old Navy, tells Refinery29. “Anna is a design and style icon, and I thought to bring that to another nineties icon, Old Navy, made perfect sense to launch this.” <br /><br />Known for “her whimsy, her magic, her cool, and her rock ‘n’ roll energy,” in the words of Posen, Sui’s <em>Almost Famous</em> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/09/10008469/penny-lane-costumes-almost-famous-kate-hudson-fashion-looks"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Penny Lane</a>-meets-witchy Stevie Nicks aesthetic is on full display with this “Bohemian collection.” Think: <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864620002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175#pdp-page-content"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">faux fur Afghan coats</a> (aka Penny Lane coats), lace cardigans, floral dusters, and <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864614002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175#pdp-page-content"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">satin slip skirts</a> (one of Sui’s favorite styles),<br /><br />But we’re not just swooning over the styles… we’re also thrilled about the prices. “There’s a lot of Anna Sui DNA incorporated into this collection, but made with the expertise of Old Navy, and into very accessible, affordable pieces,” Sui tells Refinery29 about the collection, which ranges between a $10 <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864653002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175#pdp-page-content"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">floral headscarf</a> and $120 <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864630002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">vegan suede coat</a>.</p>

<p>Sui and Posen pulled from the designer’s archives, from flowy tunic dresses, sought-after graphic T-shirts, and velvet laser-cut designs to <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864616012&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175#pdp-page-content"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">reimagining her iconic “grunge dress”</a> (for just $70). Calling the dress style “infamous” and “covetable,” Posen adds: “Now you can have it. It’s just so cool to have that kind of piece of history brought back for you to make your own history.”<br /><br />Speaking on their favorites, Sui and Posen both called out the <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864651002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175#pdp-page-content"">floral mini tunic dress</a> ($65), and offered the styling advice of belting it, pairing with a long coat, or even <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-skirts-over-jeans"">wearing it over jeans</a>. Similarly, they both love the intricate <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864610012&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175#pdp-page-content"">Victorian-inspired button-down top</a> ($50), cozy <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864618022&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175#pdp-page-content"">velvet laser-cut sweatshirt </a> ($45), and unisex <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864646002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175#pdp-page-content"">denim barn jacket</a> ($85), which Posen is planning to add to his own wardrobe.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>My natural nails and I have been on a journey. I was a chronic nail-biter for the majority of my childhood, and even as I went through college and my 20s, I constantly experienced dry, brittle nails that would break as soon as they grew past my fingertips. And while yes, I loved my Après extensions and builder gel manis to encourage growth, the truth is, these services are pricey and time-consuming. My inner monologue, screaming in QVC, knew there had to be a better way.</p>



<p>Enter from stage left, DIY nail bestie Olive &amp; June. The Los Angeles-based nail salon turned <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/regular-nail-polish-vs-gel-manicure-benefits"">polish purveyor</a> has perfected the art of the home manicure, even launching <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/olive-june-gel-system-review"">its own gel system</a> earlier this year. Taking things a step further, Olive &amp; June is unveiling its own <a href=""https://oliveandjune.com/pages/builder-gel"">Builder Gel collection</a> — and honestly, I might never set foot in a nail salon again. (I’m exaggerating, of course — support and <em>tip</em> your manicurists!) </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939495.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=734&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A367"" /></figure>



<p>“Because gel had done so well, but we knew people were like, ‘How do I get stronger, longer nails that are mine? How do I get nail extensions that I can build without a tip?'” Olive &amp; June founder and CEO Sarah Gibson Tuttle tells Refinery29. “[Our community] loves press-ons, but they wanted gel almost to work harder for them.” Designed to work seamlessly with the brand’s existing Gel Mani System (which includes a proprietary lamp, base, and top coats), Builder Gel comes in 15 sheer, milky neutrals inspired by Olive &amp; June fan favorites, and allows the user to achieve the plump, durable look and feel of salon builder gel, or craft gel extensions at home using patent-pending forms. “We want to give you the ability to either have instant extensions or grow your nails over time, and also with the color that you want,” explains Gibson Tuttle. As with salon builder gel, Olive &amp; June’s formula is a thicker consistency (compared to its regular gel polish), which allows you to manipulate the shape and get extra rise and plumpness. (Don’t worry, the brand includes a liner brush in the kit.)</p>



<p>For my second builder gel mani, Olive &amp; June graciously set me up with an appointment with manicurist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dreamer_nails/"">Julieta Martinez</a>. Martinez walked me through the steps of using the Olive &amp; June nail forms, which come in three sizes to fit your finger and create a customized extension. (If you’ve never tried nail forms before, they work by wrapping around your finger and painting on the builder gel in your desired length and shape.)</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939643.jpg?width=773&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=773%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>As much as I’d love to be a press-on girlie, I can never seem to have them stay on for more than a few hours. Builder gel extensions get me the length I love, without any glue or tips. (They also feel lighter on my fingertips than press-ons or acrylics.) For my extensions, I went with <a href=""https://oliveandjune.com/collections/gel-builder-polish/products/rose-glaze-builder-gel"">Rose Glaze</a>, a sheer pink iridescent shimmer that gave major <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wicked-for-good-movie-brand-collaborations"">Glinda vibes</a>.</p>



<p>Individual builder gel shades go for $12 apiece, and you can shop <a href=""https://oliveandjune.com/collections/builder-gel-sets/products/shimmers-new-neutrals-builder-gel-polish-set"">sets of eight</a> for $85 (a savings of $11, off the à la carte price — basically like paying for seven shades and getting one free). Removal is the only thing I hate about gel manicures, but don’t worry, Olive &amp; June has a solution for that, too. The <a href=""https://oliveandjune.com/collections/gel-removal/products/gel-removal-system"">Salon-Speed Soak-Off Kit</a> includes everything to gently remove your gels, including builder. Per the brand, start by trimming the builder extension (if applicable), then file off the top layer of top coat before soaking with acetone.</p>



<p>In general, I’m super impressed with Olive &amp; June’s builder system; I work in beauty, and even I never thought I could do my own builder gel manicure at home. For special occasions (especially ones involving nail art), I’ll still be at the salon; but in the meantime, it’s safe to say that my journey towards longer, stronger natural nails has leveled up in a major way.</p>





<p>As a fan of the existing gel system, I loved that I didn’t have to buy a separate lamp or anything to use Olive &amp; June’s new builder gels. “Builder can be very intimidating for people, especially the building the length portion of it,” Olive &amp; June’s VP of product development Anne Reigle tells us. “And because builder gel is a thicker formula than regular gel, we wanted it to be self-leveling and really easy to work with; it strengthens on contact, lengthens your nails, plumps the surface, smooths the surface, and protects your natural nails all at the same time.”</p>



<p>For my first attempt, I did a DIY mani using <a href=""https://oliveandjune.com/products/creme-caramel-builder-gel"">Creme Caramel</a>, a gorgeous warm tan shade that’s perfect for fall. I’m pretty comfortable with doing my own nails without making a mess, but the brush came in clutch for cleaning up edges before curing. (Also, flipping hands upside down for a few seconds after applying polish helps let gravity create a soft, domed shape to the nails.)</p>

<p>Happy Halloween, everyone! The astrological vibe for the creepiest time of the year is nothing short of fa-boo-lous. The Moon enters Pisces in the morning of October 31st, harmonizing with the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Sun in Scorpio</a> and squaring Uranus retrograde in Gemini. We’ll be in the mood for amusement and pleasure, making this spooky holiday bewitching. It’s a day you’ll want to sink your fangs into. Have a total scream, get wicked, and read your horror-scope below! <br /></p>



<h2>Aries </h2>



<p>It might take a lot of effort and coaxing to get you out and about, mainly because you’re thinking of having a low-key night carving pumpkins and baking pies. Rather than having a bunch of peeps over, you could invite one friend to enjoy your homemade desserts. They’ll relish the flavor and ask to take leftovers with them. When alone, you’ll indulge in a luxurious bath with Halloween-themed bubbles.</p>



<h2>Taurus </h2>



<p>There is enchantment and positivity in the air, urging you to use your power to help others. Your witchy ways can motivate those you care about to do better and change their lives significantly. Being the shoulder your pals cry and lean on, after several Spooky Spiders or Caramel Ales, allows you to offer insight on matters and advise them to evolve. Face the facts, you are their role model! </p>



<h2>Gemini </h2>



<p>Since you’re the charismatic storyteller of the zodiac, tell your pals a true-life scary hair-raiser about a haunting you experienced. After you’ve shocked your friends to the core, let one of them take over, then another, and so forth. The best way to connect is by sharing frightful narratives that bring chills, such as these. At the end of the evening, nominate the best terror-tale to take home a prize.</p>



<h2>Cancer </h2>



<p>Family is important to you, so use Halloween as a gateway to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10722191/venerate-ancestors-year-round"">connect with your ancestors</a> in another realm. Cleanse your altar with copal incense and declutter the area. Place pictures of deceased loved ones on the stand with flowers (marigolds call in the deceased) and a few of their favorite foods or items. Talk to them and celebrate their life. Lean into your shared pasts to honor their memory. </p>



<h2>Leo</h2>



<p>Your intuition is peaking, allowing you to receive psychic downloads from the universe. Take note of what you’re seeing in your journal for the future. These visions could help you make decisions when you come to a crossroads, so pay attention. You’re being told about specific events and situations for a reason and you should use the information to your advantage. Listen with an open heart and mind, Leo!</p>



<h2>Virgo </h2>



<p>The soulful Moon in Pisces is getting cozy in your seventh house of partnerships this Halloween. If you’re in a ‘ship, cuddle up with your boo on the couch and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scariest-movies-of-all-time"">watch a horror movie</a>. If you’re unattached, invite friends or your crush over and play a game that builds intimacy — no, the Ouija board isn’t advisable because it can awaken spirits, perhaps “Never Have I Ever” will be fun. </p>



<h2>Libra </h2>



<p>Although you’re known for your tender temper, this Halloween, your besties will have a chance to see that you are a wolf in sheep’s clothing. You might decide to dress as a character that allows everybody to see that you have at least two sides. No matter what you wear, your rizz will make a grand impression. Don’t fear, your look will be killer!</p>



<h2>Scorpio </h2>



<p>Slay the social scene! Mingle and party with your crew. You may even hit up a few events with everyone. Fortunately, Halloween is on a Friday, which means you can sleep in the following day if the gathering lasts until the wee hours of Saturday morning. Apple bobbing and the Monster Mash will be exhausting, so dance your heart out to Bloody Mary, knowing you can rest and relax all weekend. </p>



<h2>Sagittarius </h2>



<p>Opting to stay in and hand out treats to trick-or-treaters doesn’t mean you’re basic and boring. The opposite rings true. You’re bringing joy to children everywhere by handing out lollipops or other cool goodies they might like. If you want to embrace your inner child, throw on a mask and ask your neighbor to fill your bucket with sweets. Don’t be too shy to knock on their door.</p>



<h2>Capricorn </h2>



<p>For once, you’re not being a tryhard when hosting a soirée. You’re going with the flow and being chill — as long as no one spills red wine on your white carpet or copies your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/halloween-costumes-ideas-pop-culture"">Halloween costume</a>. Regardless, the drinks are flowing, and no one is going, indicating you know how to throw an awesome Halloween shindig. This is a fantastic step towards adulting, so totally own it and cut loose!</p>



<h2>Aquarius </h2>



<p>Looking for a ghoulish time? A bunch of your colleagues want to team up and prank your boss. At first, you might be unsure if you wish to partake in the hijinks, but once your employer lets it be known that they’re down to clown (as long as no one takes it too far), it’s on. This activity helps you to bond with coworkers in ways you never thought possible. </p>



<h2>Pisces</h2>



<p>Pisces Since the transiting Moon in Pisces syncs up with your Sun by sign, this is a time of new beginnings for you. Use the magical time to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-zodiac-sign-2025"">set an intention that brings you luck</a> and makes your dreams a reality. You can manifest anything in your heart if it aligns with your path. Meditate on your goals, light a white candle, and bring your vision to life.</p>

<p>Cosmic beings, the sky is still rippling with the emotional, existential echoes of last week’s Jupiter–Chiron square, and many of us are noticing which parts of our inner child still feel exposed, reactive, or defensive. Jupiter in Cancer wants to nurture and expand whatever it’s touching — but squaring Chiron in Aries can feel like an overwhelming magnifying glass on the sore spots we’ve tried to outgrow. You may notice themes around independence vs. support, overfunctioning vs. receiving, or childhood family roles vs. your current adult boundaries. The key? Don’t try to “fix” yourself… move with yourself. Let your body release some of the internal pressure. Dance, cry, write, scream, walk barefoot in the grass. You’re allowed to <em>feel</em> and <em>heal</em> at the same time.<br /><br />And here comes a bit of lightness: Mercury, Planet of Communication, enters Sagittarius on October 29th, helping the collective release some of that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio heaviness we’ve been marinating in</a>. Mercury in Scorpio had us speaking in riddles, keeping secrets, obsessing over the unsaid, or analyzing every look and silence. We’ve been reading between the lines for weeks — not just in others, but in ourselves too. There’s beauty in that depth, but also a risk of becoming paranoid, withdrawn, or overly cynical. Now, Mercury in Sagittarius swings open the windows. It doesn’t whisper; it shouts joyfully from the rooftop. This is your permission slip to share what you’ve learned, even if it’s still messy or raw. Say it with humor, with honesty, with heart.</p>



<p>Also: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars is in its final degrees of Scorpio</a> this week. If you trace back to September 22nd, when Mars first entered the sign of the phoenix, you might notice that you’ve been undergoing some sort of personal mission — a deep, unflinching investigation of power, passion, and purpose. As Mars approaches 29° of Scorpio, it becomes a culmination moment. A final test. A last temptation. Or, a moment of confirmation that yes, you’ve changed — even if no one else knows how much. The shift becomes clear as Mars enters Sagittarius on November 4th, but this week is your last chance to harvest the lessons of your own underworld journey.You may find yourself asking: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fall-equinox-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects""><em>What did I begin around the equinox</em></a><em> that’s reaching its climax now? What am I finally ready to release — or claim?</em> This week doesn’t rush you to answer, but it will keep nudging you toward clarity.<br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, just because it looks like stillness doesn’t mean it’s not power. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars, your ruling planet, is finishing its six-week trek through Scorpio</a> — your sector of intimacy, control, transformation, and energetic merging. But unlike some of the more dramatic Mars moments, this finale doesn’t scream. It simmers. You’ve been slowly, maybe even secretly, building momentum around something deeply personal. Whether it’s a financial entanglement, a physical craving, or an emotional reckoning, this week could reveal just how much you’ve outgrown the need to “win” at all costs. Do you really need to dominate, or are you just scared of disappearing if you don’t? Mars in Scorpio has been showing you how to reclaim your power without losing your soul. Now’s the time to integrate what you’ve learned about vulnerability, pleasure, and restraint.<br /><br />The week ends with a mic drop — or at least a one-liner. Mercury enters Sagittarius on the 29th, launching you into a more playful, philosophical headspace. Suddenly, you’re inspired to sign up for that course, book that spontaneous trip, or tell a story that’s 80% true but 100% entertaining. And honestly? We need that from you. Just be mindful that not everyone’s as down for blunt jokes or semi-accurate monologues as you are. Mercury here wants you to express your belief systems, but do it like a good stand-up set: hit ‘em with the truth and the punchline.</p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, you can’t carry someone else’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-get-closure-ex-meaning"">relationship baggage</a> and call it love. Mars is wrapping up its journey through your sector of partnership, and if it’s been exposing some passive-aggressive tension or behind-the-scenes resentment, you’re not imagining things. But this final stretch isn’t about confrontation… it’s about clarity. You’ve likely realized that your energy has limits, and the desire to merge has to be mutual. This week, ask yourself: <em>What does it look like to stay connected while still protecting your peace?</em> Mars in Scorpio didn’t just reveal others’ patterns; it showed you your own default settings in connection, especially the ways you overextend or under-express. Let this week be an energetic recalibration in love, business, and even your relationship with your own reflection.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Mercury enters your “let’s talk about the money” zone. Starting October 29th, you may find yourself talking about loans, inheritances, taxes, or even kink. Mercury in Sagittarius isn’t subtle, and when it activates your sector of shared resources and taboo topics, you’re basically in your <em>Succession</em> era — equal parts honest and unhinged. Don’t be surprised if a conversation gets way deeper than expected. Or way weirder. You’re learning to speak your truths even when they’re not pretty — and laugh about them when you’re done.</p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, you don’t always need to optimize yourself. Sometimes you just need to rest. Mars has been powering through your sector of routine, health, and responsibility since September, and now it’s almost out. This week, instead of trying to finish everything on your to-do list like you’re being filmed for a productivity documentary, check in with your body. Where are you pushing too hard? What are you avoiding by staying “busy”? Mars in Scorpio taught you how to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/burnout-at-work-recovery-tips"">confront burnout patterns</a> and perfectionist tendencies. Let yourself integrate. It’s not weakness to pause — it’s strategy. Your real power move this week is listening to your body when it whispers, not waiting until it screams.<br /><br />On a lighter note, your crush might start texting in full paragraphs again. Mercury (your ruler!) enters your opposite sign of Sagittarius on the 29th, lighting up your one-on-one connection zone. This means: more banter, bolder flirting, and possibly deeper conversations with someone who’s actually emotionally available (what a concept). It’s cuffing season, but with memes. You’re feeling more honest, and so are they — even if it’s oversharing in a “sorry-not-sorry” way. Don’t overanalyze the vibe. Lean in. Say what you mean. And maybe download Hinge again… but only if your last message wasn’t left on read.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, not all passion is sustainable… but some of it is worth the mess. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars in Scorpio is finishing its slow burn</a> through your romance, creativity, and pleasure zone, and this week is your chance to reflect on what, or who, lit you up since late September. Maybe you’ve taken bigger risks with your art, your heart, or your bed sheets. Maybe you’ve confused chaos with chemistry once or twice (hey, it’s a learning curve). But this final stretch of Mars in Scorpio isn’t about shaming yourself for what you wanted… <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/what-are-responsive-spontaneous-desire-styles"">it’s about refining your desires</a>. Who turns you on intellectually, spiritually, creatively? That’s your real type. And no, they don’t have to be perfect, just emotionally literate and occasionally funny.<br /><br />Speaking of funny… Mercury’s got jokes now. As of October 29th, Mercury enters Sagittarius and turns your everyday life into a sitcom. You’ll find humor in the absurdity of routines, and honestly? It’s medicine. Your health, work, or to-do list may have felt heavy under Mercury in Scorpio, but now you’re allowed to laugh at the chaos. Expect random inspiration to hit while brushing your teeth or running errands. Talk to your coworkers like they’re your podcast co-hosts. Say the weird joke. Eat the protein bar. Mercury in this part of your chart is a reminder: healing isn’t always solemn — sometimes it’s hilarious.</p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, your power doesn’t need an audience — but that hasn’t stopped you from delivering a performance anyway. Mars is in its final stretch through your home, family, and foundations sector, and even if you didn’t mean to stir things up… you did. But here’s the twist: it was necessary. Since September 22nd, you’ve been privately unpacking your relationship with roots, rest, and responsibility. Some Leos have moved, redecorated, cut ties, or cried in the bathtub — all valid. Now as Mars approaches 29°, the question is: <em>What emotional habitat are you building for yourself?</em> This week is less about dramatic change and more about internal integration. You’ve grown, but have you <em>noticed</em> how differently you respond to old triggers? That’s your Mars work, right there.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Mercury enters your joy sector like a chaotic but loveable bestie. Starting October 29th, Mercury in Sag lights up your romance, play, and passion zone. Translation: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/flirty-text-messages-examples"">your texts might get flirty</a>, your jokes land louder, and you may be tempted to post a thirst trap just to feel something. Mercury in Sag wants you to remember what it’s like to fall in love with your own damn mind — and maybe someone else’s too. Say yes to the spontaneous invite. Go on that “just for fun” date. Make something dumb and beautiful. You’re in your comedic rom-com era, and even if it gets messy, it’ll be entertaining as hell.</p>

<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, you’re not here to be a spreadsheet… you’re here to be the whole story. Mars in Scorpio has spent the past six weeks in your communication and expression sector, and it’s been a <em>lot</em>. You’ve probably had to have difficult conversations, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/communication-style-mercury-sign-meaning-astrology"">revisit the way you communicate boundaries</a>, or even learn how to stop over-explaining when someone clearly isn’t listening. But now, as Mars prepares to exit Scorpio next week, you’re being asked to <em>trust your voice</em>. Not the polished, PR-ready version — the messy, tender, weirdly specific one. That’s the one that hits. This week, stop editing yourself in real-time. Mars has taught you that speaking up doesn’t always mean yelling… sometimes it means whispering the truth and letting it echo.<br /><br />Now Mercury, your ruling planet, is in full Sagittarian chaos. On October 29th, Mercury enters your home and emotional roots sector, and let’s just say… your inner child is taking the wheel. Expect random family stories to surface, nostalgia to hit during a random song, and for your jokes to get more dark-humor-meets-toddler-energy. You might also feel inspired to say things to family members (chosen or blood) that you’ve held in too long. Mercury here can heal old wounds — but only if you’re willing to talk about the awkward stuff. Say it clumsily if you must. Say it while laughing. Just don’t swallow it anymore.</p>

<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, you’ve spent enough time calculating your worth… now it’s time to feel it. Mars is finishing its journey through your money and values zone, and chances are your relationship with resources — physical <em>and</em> energetic — has gone through a few plot twists. Maybe you’ve been investing more, spending less, or just noticing where your energy leaks. Mars in Scorpio doesn’t do surface-level; it wants you to understand your <em>emotional</em> relationship to currency. What’s your price for peace? What are you no longer willing to sell out for? This week is about remembering that your value doesn’t require validation. Let the final flare of Mars give you permission to invest in yourself like you’d invest in your dream. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Mercury’s entering your chatty, curious, slightly unhinged phase. On October 29th, the planet of communication enters your learning and local community zone. Expect a surge of texts, new ideas, and the occasional accidental overshare on IG stories. You’re talking faster, thinking bigger, and possibly planning three projects at once. But don’t forget: not everything needs to be monetized or turned into a brand. Mercury in Sag is here to help you <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/03/9602100/online-learning-websites-classes"">rediscover the joy of learning something</a> <em>just because</em>. Be curious, not calculating. Read a weird book. Ask a question you already know the answer to. Let wonder replace your inner critic, just for a while.</p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, you’ve burned it all down and you’ve rebuilt it from scratch. Now this week, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">your mission is to breathe</a>. Mars, your traditional ruler, has been in your sign for the past five weeks — and it’s been both a revival and a reckoning. You may have felt hyper-aware of your desires, more impulsive than usual, and somehow both exhausted and energized. As Mars prepares to exit your sign and enter Sagittarius on November 4th, you’re entering a phase of integration. What did this version of you fight for? What did it finally walk away from? This isn’t about constant transformation anymore — it’s about ownership. Mars at the final degrees of Scorpio is like the silent samurai: calm, dangerous, and done with drama. You’ve grown in ways you don’t need to prove. Trust that your actions speak loud enough now.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Mercury’s ready to spend your money or make you laugh about it. On October 29th, Mercury exits your sign and enters your income and values zone. Suddenly, your inner voice shifts from existential philosopher to impulsive travel agent. Expect a mix of financial epiphanies and random purchases — a tarot deck here, a pair of platform boots there. But deeper than that, you’re learning to speak about your worth more directly. Mercury in Sag gives you the gift of comedic timing and financial clarity… use both. Talk about your rates. Joke about capitalism. Buy the expensive oat milk if it makes your inner child giggle.</p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You’re already feeling the buzz, Sagittarius — Mercury enters your sign this week (on the 29th), and suddenly your inner monologue sounds like a TED Talk, stand-up set, and motivational speech all in one. But before you go launching into a thousand new projects, take a moment to reflect on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">the final full week of Mars in Scorpio</a> lighting up your spiritual sector. How have your subconscious patterns, intuitive nudges, and quiet obsessions shaped your motivations lately? This Mars transit has pulled you deep into your own psyche — not to make you spiral, but to help you break through. Notice what fears you’ve confronted, what secrets have surfaced, and what taboos you’re learning to reclaim. There’s strength in your shadows.<br /><br />With Mercury in your sign and a full moon in Taurus coming up next week, you’re entering a period where your words have weight — and your jokes could accidentally become spells. Use your voice with care. You might be more impulsive, excitable, or brutally honest now, and while that’s part of your charm, Sagittarius, don’t use it as a shield. Be curious rather than combative. The best breakthroughs this week come when you speak your truth <em>and</em> stay open to being surprised by others’.</p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, if you’ve been lowkey exhausted the past few weeks, Mars in Scorpio may be to blame — but also, thank. As this transit wraps up, you’re getting one last push to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ending-friendship-emotional-wellbeing"">reassess the dynamics of your friendships</a>, community, and long-term goals. Maybe someone in your circle showed their true colors, or maybe you realized you’ve outgrown certain group projects. Mars has been pruning your social garden, Capricorn, and now you get to decide what, and who, is worth watering. Make space for the relationships that feel reciprocal, collaborative, and inspiring.<br /><br />Mercury’s shift into Sagittarius on October 29 helps you loosen up and laugh again. This transit lands in your house of closure and healing, so your humor may lean toward the dry, surreal, or even absurd… but it’s cathartic. You might find yourself journaling more, reconnecting with spirituality, or speaking to a therapist (or your dream journal) with newfound honesty. Don’t underestimate the power of being funny <em>and</em> vulnerable. Your dreams may be extra vivid now, so keep track of them. They’re sending you clues. </p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You’re wrapping up a powerful chapter in your career life, Aquarius, as Mars in Scorpio spends its final days in your public image sector. Since September, this has been a time of bold moves, boundary-setting, and behind-the-scenes ambition. Maybe you’ve been wrestling with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-be-successful"">what “success” even means to you</a>, and whether it still fits the version of you you’re becoming. This week, instead of forcing momentum, try to integrate the lessons you’ve already learned. What motivates you to create? Who do you want to impact? Let your intuition be the driver now, not your ego.<br /><br />When Mercury moves into fellow fire sign Sagittarius on the 29th, your social life lights up with new connections, ideas, and invitations. You’re thinking big picture, brainstorming wild solutions, and probably texting five group chats at once. Let yourself flirt with possibility. This is the week to say yes to spontaneous convos, brainstorms, or even signing up for an online class you forgot you bookmarked. Some of the best collaborations ahead will come from unexpected DMs and late-night debates with your fellow weirdos. Say what you believe, then evolve it in real time.</p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, Mars, Planet of Action, has spent the last month stirring your desire for truth, travel, and transformation — and now, as it prepares to exit Scorpio next week, you get a final chance to process what it’s really taught you. Maybe you’ve been craving adventure, questioning old belief systems, or feeling itchy in your comfort zone. But before you jet off or burn it all down, Pisces, take stock. What ideas or philosophies have truly sustained you? Where have you gotten lost in the sauce of someone else’s worldview, and where are you ready to claim your own? This final week is a portal for recalibration.<br /><br />With Mercury entering Sagittarius on October 29, your career house lights up, and suddenly everyone wants a piece of you. Your words hold power now, so use them intentionally. Whether you’re pitching yourself, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/resume-tips"">updating your résumé</a>, or just posting something meaningful online, trust that the right people are listening. And don’t be afraid to bring your whole self — messy, mystical, hilarious — to the table. You’re allowed to be multidimensional (you are a Mutable Water sign after all). The more you let people see the real you, the more aligned opportunities will flow.</p>

Can you handle what's about to happen in the next few hours? Probably. But can you handle it on your <em>own? </em>Probably not. At least not when it comes to the<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/best-horror-movies""> scariest movies</a> of all time.<br /><br />In our opinion, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/09/11534610/angelica-ross-emma-roberts-black-trans-women-hollywood"">horror movies</a> are best consumed as a group activity. Go to the theaters in packs. Jolt at <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-horror-films-movies-shows"">the jump scares</a>. Emerge with your heart beating a <em>bit </em>too fast. Pretend, for a while, that you won't have to face the darkness alone. Inevitably, of course, you will. At some point after the movie, you'll separate from your friends and find yourself alone in your bedroom to sleep. Scenes from the movie might nip at your memory, reminding you of its<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/01/11255896/m3gan-movie-fashion-costume-design""> creepiest moments</a> and that the horrors might just exist outside of the movie theater, too. That's when the fun of the horror movie <em>really</em> begins.<br /><br />So, if you’re looking for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/04/147031/best-netflix-horror-movies"">a spooky flick to watch</a> with friends and then keep you up all night, here are our picks for the 30 scariest movies ever — if you dare.<figure><figcaption><h2><em>Sinners (2025)</em></h2>From Ryan Coogler (the visionary behind <em>Black Panther </em>and <em>Creed</em>) and starring Michael B. Jordan, <em>Sinners</em> is about twin brothers Smoke and Stack (bth played by Jordan) who are trying to leave their troubled lives behind by returning to their hometown, but they discover that an even greater evil is waiting to welcome them back. As the tagline goes: “You keep dancing with the devil, one day he’s gonna follow you home.” Also starring Wunmi Mosaku,  Hailee Steinfeld, Jack O’Connell, Jayme Lawson, Omar Benson Miller and Delroy Lindo. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Weapons (2025)</em></h2>Written and directed by <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1199107/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Zach Cregger</a>, <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/08/11926872/weapons-movie-julia-garner-review-spoilers"">Weapons</a></em> focuses on the disappearance of nearly an entire classroom except for one boy, Alex (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9816029/?ref_=fn_all_nme_1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cary Christopher</a>). When parents review the security footage in their homes, they realize that all of the missing kids woke up and ran out the door into the darkness at 2:17am on the same night. With a community searching for answers, fingers point to their teacher Justine (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/juliagarnerofficial/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Julia Garner</a>) as the culprit responsible for a mystery local police can’t even begin to solve. And as you watch, you’ll be searching for answers, too. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Nosferatu</em></h2>A Dracula tale, Robert Eggers’ <em>Nosferatu</em> is tackles the age-old story of an obsession between a haunted young woman (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lilyrose_depp/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lily-Rose Depp)</a> and the terrifying vampire (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/billskarsgard_/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bill Skarsgård</a>) infatuated with her. As it does, horror unfolds.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Fresh (2022)</em></h2>Like most good horror movies, <em>Fresh</em> starts like a fairytale: a woman named Noa (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/where-the-crawdads-sing-movie-interview"">Daisy Edgar Jones</a>) quitting dating apps and subsequently meets the supposedly perfect man, Steve (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2021/04/10427343/sebastian-stan-denise-gough-sex-scenes-monday-movie-interview"">Sebastian Stan</a>). When she accepts his invitation to a romantic weekend getaway, she finds out their love story isn't the happily ever after she was hoping for: her new man has been hiding some, ahem, unusual appetites.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Longlegs</em> (2024)<br /></h2><br />A little bit goofy and a whole lot of scary, <em>Longlegs</em> follows FBI agent Lee Harker (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2140860/"">Maika Monroe</a>) as she takes on the trials and tribulations of an unsolved serial killer case. Things take a twisted turn when she encounters a connection to the killer and has to race against time (almost as fast as your beating heart) before he mercilessly claims another family as victims.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Talk To Me </em>(2023) </h2><br />Perhaps the best horror movie to come out of Australia since <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2321549/""><em>The Babadook</em></a><em> </em>(more on that one later), <em>Talk To Me </em>combines A24 film style with a skin-crawlingly twisted story. The premise is that a group of childhood friends discover an embalmed hand that lets them communicate with spirits, which they then turn into a thrilling party game. However, things take a dark turn when the high-stakes game goes too far.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Witch </em>(2015)</h2><br />The debut film by now-notable horror director <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3211470/"">Robert Eggers</a>, <em>The Witch</em> tells the story of a family in 1600s New England whose youngest son suddenly disappears. Since the eldest daughter, Thomasin (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-anya-taylor-joy-movies-tv-shows"">Anya Taylor-Joy</a>), was the last person with the baby, the family blames her and suspicions<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/modern-witch-tarot-deck-reviews""> of witchcraft</a> begin to swirl. Slowly, paranoia ensues and the family unravels.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Midsommar</em> (2019)</h2><br />From the horror genius mind of Ari Aster, <em>Midsommar</em> follows the story of Dani (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/09/11108027/florence-pugh-makeup-venice-film-festival"">Florence Pugh</a>) as she journeys to a rural village in Sweden with her boyfriend and his friends. What starts off as a picturesque trip to take part in a midsummer festival turns into a freaky hellscape run by a violent cult. Perhaps the most unsettling part of this movie is the mix of the sunny, idyllic setting with truly terrifying, dark scenes.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Rosemary’s Baby</em> (1968)</h2><br /><br />Rosemary (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001201/"">Mia Farrow</a>), a pregnant newlywed living in a Manhattan brownstone, has a feeling that something isn't right with her baby — or with her neighbors. Though she's told not to take those suspicions seriously by the more ""rational"" people in her life, aka her husband (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001023/"">John Cassavetes</a>), Rosemary should listen to her gut, call her mom, and get out of that apartment. Alas. Instead, she's impregnated by the devil, and her baby is to be used in a Satanic ritual. <em>Rosemary's Baby </em>conjures up an unforgettable atmosphere of second-guessing that bleeds into outright fear.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Psycho</em> (1960)</h2><br />After stealing money from her boss, Marion Crane (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001463/"">Janet Leigh</a>) leaves town. After a day of traveling, she seeks refuge in a decrepit motel — but danger she encounters at this hotel is far worse than law enforcement. Marion never could've guessed the secrets the hotel's innocuous-seeming manager, Norman Bates (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000578/"">Anthony Perkins</a>), was hiding. <em>Psycho </em>manages to be one of the scariest movies ever without <em>any </em>gore whatsoever. Instead, the movie will make you question where all of your casual decisions might be leading you.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Don't Look Now</em> (1973)</h2><br />John Baxter (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000661/"">Donald Sutherland</a>) and his wife Laura (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001046/"">Julie Christie</a>) are devastated when their daughter dies. In the aftermath, John takes a job restoring a church in Venice. There, they meet two strange old women who claim to see their daughter. <em>Don't Look Now </em>is a stunning work of psychological horror adapted from a story by Daphne du Maurier, the author of <em>Rebecca</em>. It's light on gore but big on scares.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Hush</em> (2016) </h2><em>Hush </em>is a creative entry into the horror genre. The movie follows an intense cat-and-mouse game between a stalker and his unwilling victim. Maddie (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2318089/"">Kate Siegel</a>) is a deaf author who lives alone. <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0302330/"">John Gallagher Jr.</a> is the masked killer who thinks she's going to be an easy target. He's wrong.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Exorcist </em>(1973)</h2><br />Good luck getting Regan's (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000304/"">Linda Blair</a>) ravings out of your mind after seeing <em>The Exorcist</em>. Over the course of this horror classic, Regan goes from being a sweet elementary-schooler to a foul-mouth demon. And no, puberty isn't to blame. The devil is.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>28 Days Later </em>(2002)</h2><br />What would<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/01/11257325/the-last-of-us-hbo-premiere-everything-to-know""> the zombie apocalypse</a> actually look like? How would it reshape the world? After a virus contaminates the population, civilization quickly crumbles. <em>28 Days Later </em>is a movie about the flimsiness of our institutions, and how susceptible we are to something like the rage virus. Oh, and it stars a young <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0614165/"">Cillian Murphy</a>.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>It Follows </em>(2014)</h2><br /><br />So many horror movies are structured around the idea that <em>something </em>is coming for the main characters. <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/"">In <em>Alien</em>,</a> it's the xenomorph. In <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087800/""><em>A</em> <em>Nightmare on Elm Street</em></a>, it's Freddy Krueger. <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3235888/""><em>It Follows</em></a><em> </em>cleverly updates the tropes seen in these movies. After Jay (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2140860/"">Maika Monroe</a>) sleeps with her boyfriend Hugh (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1621032/"">Jake Weary</a>) for the first time, she contracts a terrible STD: Death is following her, until she passes it on to someone else. If it kills Jay, it kills everyone who came before her, too.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Omen </em>(1976)</h2><br />Ever babysit a kid and just<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/10/11159487/black-latina-ghost-hunters""> get the shivers</a>? <em>The Omen</em> will confirm that, indeed, some children are just bad eggs — and of that set, Damien (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0827032/"">Harvey Spencer Stephens</a>) is the baddest egg of all. After Katherine (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001665/"">Lee Remick</a>) gives birth to a stillborn baby boy, her husband Robert (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000060/"">Gregory Peck</a>) and doctor conspire to replace him with an orphan — and not tell Katherine. Soon, everyone around baby Damien starts dying. That’s right: Robert may have accidentally adopted the antichrist.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> (1974)</h2><br /><br />What begins as a road trip turns into a nightmare after Sally (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0122782/"">Marilyn Burns</a>), her brother, and two of their friends encounter a group of outcasts living in a barn — one of whom is a serial killer. In this movie, you can catch Leatherface at the beginning of his long franchise life. Horrifyingly, <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> is based on the true story of Ed Gein, who made masks from the skins of his victims.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Conjuring </em>(2013)</h2><br /><br />Taking place in Rhode Island in the ‘70s, <em>The Conjuring</em> details the events of real-life paranormal investigators and demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren as they are called upon to investigate a family being terrorized in their new<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/10/126422/haunted-houses-vacation-rentals""> haunted house</a>. Plus, this movie is a gateway into the entire <em>Conjuring </em>film universe, which includes <em>Annabelle</em>, <em>The Nun</em> and <em>The Conjuring</em> sequels, all of which are based on the Warrens' supposed exploits.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Hereditary</em> (2018)</h2><br /><br />If only a movie could come with a seatbelt. In the case of <em>Hereditary</em>, we’d want one. The movie begins with the death of the Graham family matriarch. As the family grieves, they’re haunted by a malevolent presence. Get ready for a jolting, shocking ride. This is the aforementioned Ari Aster’s first film — and it will certainly keep you up at night.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Carrie</em> (1976)</h2><br /><br /><em>Carrie </em>takes the inherent horrors of high school seriously. For Carrie (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000651/"">Sissy Spacek</a>), high school is a waking nightmare. She’s relentlessly bullied at school. At home, her uber-religious mother punishes her constantly. Carrie’s head is a swirling mess of repression. Eventually, she finds release at the high school prom, where she’s christened Prom Queen in an outpouring of pig’s blood. The movie culminates in one of the most memorable, horrifying climaxes in cinematic history.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Halloween</em> (1978)</h2><br /><br />The original <em>Halloween</em>, released 50 years ago, is a stalwart in the slasher genre. Michael Myers, recently freed from a mental institution, runs amok in the town of Haddonfield, IL targeting teenagers especially. Laurie (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000130/"">Jamie Lee Curtis</a>) is a babysitter who manages to outsmart (or maybe just outrun) him. Watch it so you can have a whole <em>Halloween</em> marathon that includes the final entry from 2022 in the recent reboot trilogy, which takes place when Laurie is older, waiting for the return of her tormentor. The final girl lives on.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Alien</em> (1979)</h2><br />The game: survival. The players: the hapless human crew of the spaceship Nostromo and the xenomorph, a slimy alien with rows of fangs for teeth. <em>Alien </em>is a gore-fest, reminding us that death could (literally) be around any corner. The movie also introduced one of the most iconic woman heroes and final girls of all time: Ellen Ripley (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000244/"">Sigourney Weaver</a>).<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Shining</em> (1980)</h2><br /><br />Where art house cinema meets horror meets psychological thriller, that’s where you’ll find <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000040/"">Stanley Kubrick’s</a> <em>The Shining. </em>Writer Jack Torrance (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000197/"">Jack Nicholson</a>) relocates his wife Wendy (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001167/"">Shelley Duvall</a>) and his psychic son, Danny (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0515950/"">Danny Lloyd</a>), to Colorado’s Overlook Hotel for the winter. They think they’re alone, but they're not. Ghosts populate the Overlook Hotel. And soon, so does madness.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Get Out</em> (2017)</h2><br /><a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1443502/"">Jordan Peele's</a> Oscar-nominated directorial debut is certainly scary because of the jump scares and unexpected twists. But what sets <em>Get Out </em>apart from every other horror movie is its incisive — and terrifying — commentary about race in America. Chris (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2257207/"">Daniel Kaluuya</a>) goes with his white girlfriend, Rose (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4129745/"">Alison Williams</a>), to meet her family in their upstate mansion. He can't shake the feeling that something's <em>off </em>with her family. He's incredibly right. If you like Peele’s work, then you also need to watch <em>Us</em> (2019) and<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/07/11058789/jordan-peele-nope-ending-explainer""> <em>Nope</em> (2022)</a>.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Paranormal Activity</em> (2007)</h2><br /><br />By introducing the concept of ""found footage,"" <em>The Blair Witch Project </em>reshaped the entire horror movie genre. <em>Paranormal Activity </em>brought the found footage feeling right to your living room.

Except in <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em>, sleep is where you're most susceptible to Freddy Krueger (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000387/"">Robert Englund</a>), a demon who kills teenagers in their dreams — and then ensures their death in reality.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Silence Of The Lambs</em> (1991)</h2><br /><br />In <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em>, FBI investigators realize the only way they can catch the serial killer Buffalo Bill (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0505971/"">Ted Levine</a>) is by consulting someone who knows the killer mind intimately: Dr. Hannibal Lecter (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000164/"">Anthony Hopkins</a>), a convicted cannibalistic serial killer already locked up. Clarice Starling (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000149/"">Jodie Foster</a>) is forced to get close to the masked, smooth-talking Dr. Lecter who could — and does — eat a human as casually as he eats a lamb chop.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Ring</em> (1998)</h2><br /><br />Good luck staring at a TV set after watching<em> Ring</em>. The premise of this Japanese movie — which was later turned into the 2002 American movie <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298130/""><em>The Ring</em></a><em> </em>— is terrifying: Watch a cursed video tape, and have seven days to live, unless you make a copy of the tape and pass it on. In that case, you’ve cursed someone else. In<em> Ring</em>, the boundaries between<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/10/11788325/best-new-streaming-movies-tv-shows-october""> what we watch</a> and our fate is tied together inherently. Fortunately that’s not normally the case<em> </em>— otherwise fans of serial killer shows would be in trouble.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Orphanage </em>(2007)</h2><br /><br /><em>The Orphanage </em>is a thought-provoking and thrilling entry into <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/04/147031/best-netflix-horror-movies"">the horror genre</a> which will appeal to <em>all</em> movie buffs. At the start of the movie, Laura (Belén Rueda), her husband (Fernando Cayo), and adoptive son (Roger Princep) return to the orphanage where she was raised. She hopes to convert the orphanage into a home for disabled children. Instead, she stumbles upon the orphanage's dark history, which manifests in ghost form.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Babadook</em> (2014)</h2><br /><br />“If it's in a word, or it's in a look, you can't get rid of the Babadook.” So goes the rhyme which repeats, like an unforgettable motif, throughout this Australian movie. In <em>The Babadook</em>, a single mother (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0204583/"">Essie Davis</a>) and her son (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5231168/"">Noah Wiseman</a>) live together in an old house that is <em>already </em>scary — and then becomes <em>super </em>scary when a long-limbed monster called the Babadook makes his presence known. <em>The Babadook </em>is a chilling story about loss and trauma nestled inside a conventional horror movie format.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Blair Witch Project </em>(1999)</h2><br /><br /><em>The Blair Witch Project </em>could be the scariest movie on this list, simply because of how <em>real </em>it seems. Typically, while watching a<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/best-horror-movies""> horror movie</a>, you can rationalize some of the fears away by reminding yourself of its fictional nature. But that's harder to do when watching a movie like <em>Blair Witch</em>. The movie depicts three film students (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0931321/"">Michael Williams</a>, Joshua Leonard, and <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0231946/"">Heather Donohue</a>) who supposedly set forth to find the Blair Witch in 1994; the movie is the footage they left behind. When it premiered at Sundance in 1999, some viewers really did think it was a documentary.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Audition</em> (1999)</h2><br /><br />You haven't seen a<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/10/11138345/do-revenge-drea-camila-mendes-video""> revenge movie</a> until you've seen <em>Audition</em>. In this Japanese movie, a widowed film producer sets about finding a wife very methodically. He'll interview women for a nonexistent movie part. When he finds a properly submissive woman, he'll ask her out on a date. But he wasn't prepared for Asami (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0793402/"">Eihi Shiina</a>), the 28th auditionee of the day with a gruesome plan of her own.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Open Water </em>(2003)</h2><br /><br />Some might say that <em>Open Water </em>is the scariest movie on this list, but not because it’s a classic horror movie. A couple goes on a scuba diving expedition during a beach vacation. Then, the boat leaves them in the middle of the ocean. On the surface of the water, they panic and bicker. Beneath them, sharks start to circle. No movie will inspire more existential dread than this one, watching people face the inevitability of their death. On a final note: <em>Open Water </em>is based on a true story, which makes it all the more scary.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>IT </em>(2017)</h2><br /><br />Every 27 years, the children of Derry are preyed on by a shape-shifting force of evil who typically takes the form of a painted clown (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0803889/"">Bill Skarsgård</a>). The year IT comes back, a group of misfits called the Loser's Club decides to take the monster on. <em>IT </em>is set in a world in which no one can protect kids but themselves.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Suspiria </em>(2018)</h2><br /><br /><a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0345174/"">Luca Guadagnino's</a> remake of <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000783/"">Dario Argento's</a> classic horror film is a deeply unsettling tale of witchcraft, ballet, and violence. Warning: There is one particularly gruesome scene that some viewers found so repulsing they actually got physically ill. It involves a dancer's bones breaking as a dancer in a second room inadvertently controls her grotesque movements. If you’re prone to squeamishness, maybe steer clear of this movie. <br /><br /></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<p><em>Welcome to “</em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/whats-good""><em>What’s Good</em></a><em>,” a column where we break down what’s soothing, distracting, or just plain good in the streaming world with a “rooting for everybody Black” energy. This edition is all about </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3lgD59KrTw"">Hedda</a><em>, starring </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/03/11311288/tessa-thompson-creed-3-bianca-therapy""><em>Tessa Thompson</em></a><em> and directed by </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-marvels-movie-woke-backlash""><em>Nia DaCosta,</em></a><em> in theaters now and streaming on Prime Video on October 29. I also spoke to Thompson and DaCosta about the film below. </em></p>



<p><strong>What’s Good? </strong><em>Hedda</em> is good because <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2025-10-23/nia-dacosta-tessa-thompson-hedda-interview"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nia DaCosta</a> is great. And <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2019/04/230130/is-little-woods-realistic-interview-tessa-thompson"">Tessa Thompson</a> is even better. The DaCosta-directed adaptation of Henrik Ibsen’s classic play stars Thompson in the titular role as Hedda Gabler, an ambitious, repressed housewife still hung up on her prodigious ex-lover, Eileen (played by an enthralling <a href=""https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/nina-hoss-hedda-interview-1235156752/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nina Hoss</a>) and bored by her prosaic husband, George (a delightfully aloof and banal <a href=""https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a65454630/who-is-tom-bateman-daisy-ridley-husband/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tom Bateman</a>). Hedda’s disenchantment comes to a head at a dinner party where Eileen shows up with her new girlfriend, Thea (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/impoots/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Imogen Poots</a> playing frantic and overwrought perfectly), as she’s vying for the same job as George. Throw in Hedda’s other sometimes-lover Judge Roland Brack (a mischievous and menacing <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/nicholaspinnock/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nicolas Pinnock</a>) in the mix and you’ve got a night of mayhem and manipulation. </p>



<p>Set in 1950s England, as the party devolves into shambles — mostly orchestrated by Hedda herself — <em>Hedda</em> goes from a simmering conversation about what happens to a woman bound by her circumstances to a sexy psychological thriller about class, power, and ambition. As the events of the evening unfold, Hedda becomes more and more quietly unhinged and Thompson is so magnetic, oozing with charisma, that you can’t look away and you can’t help but root for one of the messiest women in cinematic history. I like to think of this column as my own Oscars. The Academy is going to deem their own “best of the best” come March 2026, and while Tessa Thompson’s name should definitely be on that ballot, in this space, I get to say what’s the best of the year and I am telling you — unequivocally — that <em>Hedda</em> is one of the best films and performances of the past year. Period. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Hedda is frustrating because even when you disagree with her choices on a fundamental level, you understand every single one of her motivations for being a manipulative, conniving, chaos monster. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>Who It’s Good For (spoilers ahead): </strong>I’m probably supposed to say that Hedda is good because it shows you a complex female character we haven’t seen onscreen before but I don’t think that’s true. We’ve seen many complex female characters onscreen — some were played by Thompson. What makes <em>Hedda</em> so great and unique is that the complex female character that we’re seeing is not only Black, she’s also queer, and she’s one of the most <em>infuriating</em> characters I’ve ever watched. Complimentary! Hedda is frustrating because even when you disagree with her choices on a fundamental level, you understand every single one of her motivations for being a manipulative, conniving, chaos monster. She does all of these things — like (spoiler!) burn Eileen’s manuscript — because she is handcuffed by the confines of her surroundings. In order to break free of those constraints, Hedda acts out and becomes an architect of destruction. The thing this movie says so boldly is not only is Hedda’s acting out OK, it’s fucking fun to watch. As Hedda blows up her own world and unravels the life she has carefully crafted while desperately trying to hold onto it, the audience is watching her fight for freedom. And that’s relatable to any woman, but it’s also liberating to watch a Black woman push to define herself, even if her methods are questionable. </p>



<p>The question at the center of <em>Hedda</em>, according to DaCosta, is “What does freedom look like?” she tells me over Zoom from New York, sitting beside Thompson. “Especially when it comes to how we represent ourselves, how we represent ourselves as Black women, is it freedom to limit ourselves to just these stereotypically positive traits, like being elegant or strong or noble? Is that freedom?” It’s not. I think true freedom for Black characters to be able to be <em>whatever they are</em> in all of their complicated, messy, frustrating, contradicting ways, just like human beings are, and just like their white counterparts so often get to be.</p>



<p>“I understand historically that we have to make sure that we’re not going to invite literal violence, by showing a negative portrayal of Blackness. I’m really empathetic to that attempt, but I also think it does limit us,” DaCosta continues. “For me, what’s been so important is seeing dynamic, human, Black women on screen in my life. I think that’s really what builds empathy, not making a small box for ourselves that we have to fit into. It was really exciting for me, but I also knew that people might get a little upset.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Over the course of my career, I’ve somehow gotten very, very lucky to play women that are complicated and interesting and aren’t always completely digestible or perfect. It’s just always been what I’ve been attracted to.</p><cite>tessa thompson</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>I didn’t find it upsetting to watch Hedda elegantly stomping around her party looking stunning (seriously, has anyone ever looked better onscreen than Thompson in this role?) and actively dismantling the lives of everyone around her. I found it fascinating. And because Thompson plays Hedda with nuance and depth, it never feels like her manipulation is simply incidental. Even when Hedda is at her absolute worst — like trying to convince Eileen to end her own life (diabolical!) — you can see that her judgement is clouded by self preservation, heartbreak, and desperation. It’s in those moments of inner turmoil where Hedda, and Thompson, shine. “Over the course of my career, I’ve somehow gotten very, very lucky to play women that are complicated and interesting and aren’t always completely digestible or perfect. It’s just always been what I’ve been attracted to,” Thompson says. “And I think the thing that felt particularly exciting about this piece is Ibsen, in the head of Gabler, wrote the prototypical first, way-ahead-of-her-time complicated, messy woman. I think what felt really exciting is to turn that on its head and to reimagine it and to repurpose it and to reconstruct it in all the beautiful ways that Nia was able to.” </p>



<p>If you’re familiar with Ibsen’s play, you’ll love <em>Hedda</em>. And if you’re not, you’ll be in awe of how timely the text still is, and you’ll — in spite of yourself — fall in love with a character who may or may not love herself and is intent on challenging everyone around her to face their own inner demons. There’s a method to her menace.</p>



<p><strong>How Good Is It? </strong><em>Hedda</em> is so good, I’ve seen it four times – twice at the <a href=""https://tiff.net/films/in-conversation-with-tessa-thompson-and-nia-dacosta"">Toronto International Film Festival</a> because I went to the premiere and hosted an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE1ZaBKR5IY"">In Conversation with Thompson and DaCosta</a>, and twice again to prep for our interview. Each time, I found something new to fixate on. The last time, I found myself connecting Hedda’s plight as a queer 1950s housewife without the freedom to live as she desires to the current <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/12/11161942/tiktok-black-tradwives-burnout-marriage-capitalism"">tradwife resurgence</a>. I ask DaCosta about the connection: “I find the tradwife thing super interesting because I can totally see that being a valid economic choice, considering the shit show that is our current climate, economy, world,” DaCosta says. “And also, you see it happen a lot where women choose to give up parts of their freedom so that they can feel safe, even though I don’t think that actually makes you safe.” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>How we represent ourselves as Black women, is it freedom to limit ourselves to just these stereotypically positive traits, like being elegant or strong or noble? Is that freedom?”</p><cite>nia dacosta</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“I think Hedda is someone who’s wrestling with that. Actually, she’s wrestling with [the thoughts that] these things make me safe, or they’re supposed to make me safe, but they’re also killing me,” DaCosta continues. “That battle is where so much of her frustration and her violence comes from, not just the violence she directs outwards, but also towards herself. But I think that’s so complicated for her to unpick and what we’re watching is someone unpick that in whatever way she can.”</p>



<p>As Hedda battles with herself, there’s a rage simmering underneath every smirk and every one of her bleak and destructive actions. Whether that rage makes Hedda suicidal is up for debate up until the final frame. When I ask Thompson about female rage, she says she was able to say so much about the topic through <em>Hedda</em>. “I think there is a tremendous amount of rage that gets started inside of us as humans full stop, but particularly related to moving through the world as a woman,” Thompson says. “I’ve spoken about my grandmothers on this press tour, because I started with them [in preparing for <em>Hedda</em>]. I started to imagine the rage that they must have felt that never got to be expressed. For my father’s mother, she immigrated to this country as a young woman of color in working spaces, managing the whole house. And her life revolved around her family, and she happily made that choice.”</p>



<p>“But I look at photographs of her before she immigrated, [she’s] free on a beach with her friends. I think there was a certain kind of freedom that she had before she came to America and was suddenly a Black American,” Thompson continues. “I just imagine all of the things that she must have felt, all of the private rage that she must have suppressed, and the same for my maternal grandmother. It felt like getting to play this character, to unleash that rage, maybe not in the kindest ways, as Hedda, but it felt like getting to exorcize that for all of the women in my life, for the woman I have been in the past that had secret, private rage at the violence sometimes that you can experience as a young girl moving through the world. It felt good to put it on screen and I hope that in some private ways, it can help people who see the film, and particularly women, to just engage with that. It doesn’t mean you need to cause harm because of it, but don’t deny that you might feel [rage]. Allow yourself the space.”</p>



<p>And that’s ultimately what Thompson and DaCosta have done: provided a space where female rage, complexity, and messiness can coexist. It’s work that I imagine would make Thompson’s grandmothers very proud. Often when we talk about artists on the margins — the ones who aren’t white or straight or male or all three — we talk about the past or about how much they still have to achieve, how excellent they have to be in order to be worthy enough to earn their place. Tessa Thompson and Nia DaCosta are already there, and more importantly, they do work that makes us look forward with hope and endless possibility. That’s how I felt watching <em>Hedda</em>.</p>



<p>Turning Henrik Ibsen’s play into a sensual Black, queer, romp for modern audiences was risky. But Thompson and DaCosta have proven time and time again that they take big swings. From blockbusters (both have dabbled in the Marvel universe, Thompson is the star of the <em>Creed</em> franchise and DaCosta is about to direct the next instalment of  the <em>28 Years Later</em> series), to daring adaptations, to small original ideas (they first collaborated on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/04/229875/little-woods-movie-review-lily-james-tessa-thompson""><em>Little Woods</em></a>), this director-actor duo do all the things we’re being told can’t exist in Hollywood anymore. And their latest collaboration is their best yet. Ultimately, <em>Hedda</em> is a stunning reimagining that painstakingly and purposefully builds towards an astonishing climax. It’s gorgeous and bold and just another entry into the canon of both DaCosta and Thompson’s work about complicated, brilliant, and infuriating women. </p>

And as it gets colder, think of coats made from wool, fleece, and puffer materials as well as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cape-coats-jackets-trend"">styles with scarf details</a> for extra coverage and warmth.<br /><br />To provide a little shopping inspiration, we've gathered our top picks from reader-favorite retailers like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lululemon-loungewear-loungeful-collection"">Lululemon</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-free-people-fp-movement-sets-co-ords"">Free People</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-sandy-liang-collaboration-2025"">Gap</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-damson-madder-new-arrivals"">Damson Madder</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/maeve-anthropologie-bestsellers-review"">Anthropologie</a> to cart up and elevate your fall ‘fits. <br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.
