Challenging the visual dominance of conventional museum design, the project introduces smell, memory, and multisensory perception into spatial narration. Guided by principles of openness, collaboration, and sustainability, the museum is conceived not merely as an attractive cultural destination, but as a platform for public engagement with the history of perfumery, traditional craftsmanship, and contemporary technologies. It offers an ideal environment to experience the evolution of fragrance creation. Through architectural expression, the intangible nature of scent is transformed into a tangible, spatial encounter—establishing the museum as a vital venue for dialogue and exchange within global fragrance culture.</p>",

<h4>Design principles for AI in complex systems.</h4><figure><img alt=""A painting of the Titanic Sinking"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*CN4GKLm09b9Mtmes.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Source: Artnet.com</figcaption></figure><p>Today we are at the cusp of revolutions in artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, renewable energy, and biotechnology. Each brings extraordinary promise, but each introduces more complexity, more interdependence, and more <a href=""https://www.behaviouralsafetyservices.com/Content/Downloads/Reason-Paper-Human-Error.pdf"">latent pathways to failure</a>. This elevates prudence to be critical. Good design recognizes what cannot be foreseen. It acknowledges the limits of prediction and control. It builds not merely for performance, but for recovery.</p><h4><strong>Design Not Blame</strong></h4><p>When something goes wrong, our gut reaction is to turn to the person involved. This is sometimes known as the <a href=""https://www.safetywise.com/post/latent-conditions-vs-active-failures-the-icam-investigator-s-guide-to-seeing-the-whole-picture"">active failure</a>, ascribing failure merely to the active failure is a mistake. It is a mistake that shows lack of appreciation for systems, for latent complexity, for the reality of how things fail. This reflex is a vestige of an older worldview, one in which human vigilance and effort were assumed to be the primary safeguards against failure. Now we know better.</p><p>The systems view rejects this premise entirely. A system, as we have repeated, is perfectly designed to get the results it gets. If a system produces recurring failures, the fault lies not with the operator but with the structure that shaped the operator’s choices. Good design aims not at perfect people but at ordinary people performing reliably under normal conditions.</p><p>In that spirit, good performance is not attained when we muster greater attention or exhort people to “try harder.” Rather, exceptional performance is achieved through exceptional design. Design which shapes the conditions in such a way that the correct action and the natural action are two of the same. In a well-designed system, error is eliminated not because humans have been improved, but because the system has been made incapable of producing predictable failure.</p><h4>An Integrated Philosophy of Design</h4><p>Each of the following major themes offers a distinct lens on design, but together they form a coherent blueprint.</p><h4>Latent Errors: The Why</h4><p>Latent errors teach us <em>why</em> systems fail: because latent conditions accumulate, hide, and align. The Swiss Cheese Model and <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/bad-design-is-like-a-virus-design-defects-and-latent-failures-1e0ab4be7e52"">resident pathogen metaphor</a> remind us that complexity and opaqueness invite disaster. This provides the largest, systems-focused perspective of human error and systems design. It provides the backdrop for all our design considerations.</p><figure><img alt=""Reason’s Swiss Cheese Model"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*LL8fgYaGsNyiabnP.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Source: Reason, 1997</figcaption></figure><p>Design decisions made today become the latent failures of tomorrow. Every shortcut, every unexamined assumption, every added layer of complexity is a pathogen waiting for the right conditions to cause harm.</p><h4>The Automation Paradox: The How</h4><p><a href=""https://ftp.nsjonline.com/virtual-library/Nwbza9/6GF209/the-automation-paradox.pdf"">This paradox </a>shows <em>how</em> the design and integration of automation impacts human performance and cognition. It shows that the greater trust we put on automation [any technology] the more trust we MUST put on it, for it necessarily makes the human actors even weaker. This perpetuates a vicious cycle that is not easy to extricate ourselves from.</p><p>Automation changes human capability in ways that make system failure more catastrophic. When automation works, humans deskill. When automation fails, humans cannot recover.</p><h4>Rasmussen’s Conundrum: The Where</h4><p>Jens Rasmussen reveals <em>where</em> automation excels and where it collapses. The <a href=""https://open.substack.com/pub/performancesystems/p/automation-conundrum-the-narrow-window?r=4qwh5w&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true"">Automation Conundrum</a> illustrates the narrow window of optimal performance and the importance of adaptability outside that window.</p><p>Superhuman peak performance means nothing if you cannot ensure conditions stay within the narrow range where that performance is achieved.</p><figure><img alt=""A chart showing the Rasmussen Conundrum: Automation exceeds humans in only a tightly controlled environment"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*9ZLwAj4tZJ8dic5t.png"" /><figcaption>Source: Author</figcaption></figure><h4>Together</h4><p>When combined, these frameworks yield a unified principle: Design must anticipate failure, accommodate human limitations, and employ technology in ways that extend human resilience.</p><h4>A Philosophy of Conservative Decision-Making</h4><p>Few figures embody this philosophy better than <a href=""https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/research-guides/modern-biographical-files-ndl/modern-bios-r/rickover-hyman-g.html"">Admiral Hyman G. Rickover</a>. Admiral Rickover was the first admiral of the nuclear navy. Under his leadership, the US designed and built the first nuclear submarines. Ostensively living and working next to a nuclear reactor comes with risks most people cannot fathom. Rickover recognized that catastrophic failures in complex systems seldom arise from the final, active failure. They originate as a consequence of earlier decisions. Decisions about materials, oversight, testing, assumptions, priorities. His remedy was a disciplined ethic of restraint and responsibility.</p><figure><img alt=""Admiral Rickover on the cover of Time Magazine, Jan 1954"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/0*lHB5ysPN2hJsllet.jpg"" /><figcaption>Source: Content.Time.Com</figcaption></figure><p>Rickover insisted on what he called <a href=""https://taproot.com/non-conservative-decision-making/"">conservative decision-making</a>. This meant favoring the proven over the novel, the simple over the clever, the transparent over the abstract. It also favors direct accountability over distributed blame. Rickover required engineers to understand every system they touched, to foresee how it could fail, and to take personal responsibility for its performance.</p><p>This philosophy is not opposed to innovation. It is opposed to undue confidence and corner cutting. It rejects the fantasy that more automation, more layers of protection, or more complexity can eliminate human fallibility. Instead, Rickover’s ethic aligns perfectly with Reason, and Rasmussen: The best systems are those designed with keen awareness of their limits, with clarity in how they function, and resilient in the face of the unexpected.</p><h4>Design and AI</h4><p>Nowhere are the principles of good design more urgently needed than in systems that incorporate artificial intelligence. AI is not merely another automation layer; it is a new kind of agent inside our systems — opaque, statistical, fast, and prone to unfamiliar <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/failure-mode"">failure modes</a>. It makes predictions rather than following instructions, and its logic is embedded in inscrutable data patterns rather than explicit rules. All of this magnifies the challenges highlighted by Reason, Rasmussen, and Rickover.</p><h4>AI Accumulates Latent Failures</h4><p>AI systems, by their very nature, accumulate latent failures. They learn from datasets we did not fully inspect, absorb correlations we did not intend, and behave in ways that are not visible or understandable from the outside. A model might perform flawlessly for months before a quiet change in data distribution causes an abrupt collapse.</p><p>This is Reason’s “resident pathogens” writ large: dormant vulnerabilities that lie hidden until the right alignment triggers failure. Every training decision, every data preprocessing choice, every architecture selection, every hyperparameter is a potential pathogen. And unlike traditional software where we can inspect the logic, AI embeds these decisions in millions of parameters that no human can comprehend.</p><p>The problem is compounded because:</p><ul><li>Training data is never complete or representative</li><li>Correlations learned may be spurious</li><li>Performance on training data doesn’t guarantee real-world performance</li><li>Models drift as real-world conditions change</li><li>Failure modes are unpredictable and emergent</li></ul><h4>AI Erodes Human-Centered Design</h4><p>AI erodes the very foundations of <a href=""https://medium.com/dc-design/what-is-human-centered-design-6711c09e2779"">human-centered design</a>. Visibility, mapping, and feedback weaken when decisions emerge from statistical inference. Users cannot form an accurate mental model of a system when its internal logic is fundamentally opaque.</p><p>A well-designed traditional system has clear cause-and-effect relationships. You turn the dial, the temperature changes. You press the button, the action occurs. You can build a mental model of how it works and predict what will happen.</p><p>AI systems break this clarity. You provide input, you get output, but the relationship between them is inscrutable. Why did the AI make this recommendation? What factors did it consider? What would happen if conditions changed? These questions often have no satisfying answers.</p><p>A well-designed AI system must restore visibility through explanations, constraints, and clear domain limits so that human operators understand not just what the AI chose, but why and under what assumptions. This means:</p><ul><li>Clear communication of confidence levels</li><li>Explanation of key factors in decisions</li><li>Explicit boundaries of competence</li><li>Graceful degradation when uncertain</li><li>Human-understandable reasoning paths</li></ul><h4>AI Intensifies the Automation Paradox</h4><p>Rasmussen’s automation conundrum becomes particularly acute with AI. AI excels in routine, predictable environments but breaks sharply at the edges. This is especially manifest in <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14859"">instances where people are deliberately trying to break AI</a>. When conditions drift or the unexpected occurs, AI systems fail in ways that human operators are least prepared to correct. Meanwhile, human skill declines as more decision-making is delegated to the machine.</p><figure><img alt=""A sketch explaining the automation paradox. Reliance on technology leads to fast, unexpected failures"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*BC598V3Egz_dPzvq"" /><figcaption>Source: Sketchplanations.com</figcaption></figure><p>The result is a brittle system which may be high-performing on ordinary days, but extremely volatile and vulnerable on extraordinary ones.</p><p>But AI makes this worse than traditional automation because:</p><ul><li>AI failure modes are less predictable (it doesn’t just stop working; it confidently produces wrong answers)</li><li>AI operates in domains requiring judgment (not just mechanical tasks)</li><li>AI deskills faster (it handles tasks humans used to do cognitively, not just physically)</li><li>Recovery is harder (humans may not recognize AI errors without domain expertise)</li></ul><h4>AI Demands Conservative Decision-Making</h4><p>Rickover’s philosophy offers the necessary counterweight. Conservative decision-making demands restraint: use AI where it is appropriate, proven, and transparent, not merely where it is impressive.</p><p>This means:</p><ul><li>Favor smaller, interpretable models over unnecessarily complex ones</li><li>Limit autonomy in high-stakes domains</li><li>Maintain human accountability for every decision the system makes</li><li>Require understanding of failure modes before deployment</li><li>Choose proven approaches over novel ones</li><li>Insist on transparency in how decisions are made</li></ul><p>In Rickover’s world, responsibility cannot be delegated to software. Someone must always “sign their name.” This echos a popular meme going around allegedly showing a memo from IBM in the 1970s. “A computer can never be held accountable…Therefore a computer must never make a management decision. This principle becomes even more critical with AI, where the temptation is to let the algorithm decide without human oversight let alone accountability.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/687/0*TJuzJ5y0jw9vqYOL"" /></figure><h4>Practical Philosophy for AI Design</h4><p>Taken together, these perspectives form a coherent philosophy for AI design. AI does not require us to reinvent the principles of good design. It requires us to apply them more rigorously than ever before.</p><h4>1. Assume AI Will Fail</h4><p>Design systems assuming AI will fail, not assuming it will work. This means:</p><ul><li>Clear handoff protocols when AI reaches its limits</li><li>Human oversight for critical decisions</li><li>Fallback mechanisms that don’t depend on AI</li><li>Monitoring for distribution drift and performance degradation</li><li>Regular testing outside the training distribution</li></ul><h4>2. Preserve Human Capability</h4><p>Don’t allow AI to completely deskill human operators. This means:</p><ul><li>Keeping humans in the loop for critical decisions</li><li>Requiring periodic manual operation of tasks</li><li>Training for exceptions, not just normal operation</li><li>Maintaining domain expertise even when AI handles routine cases</li></ul><h4>3. Demand Transparency</h4><p>Insist on explainable AI for any consequential application. This means:</p><ul><li>Understanding what factors influence decisions</li><li>Knowing the confidence level of predictions</li><li>Recognizing when the AI is operating outside its competence</li><li>Being able to audit decisions after the fact</li></ul><h4>4. Define Clear Boundaries</h4><p>Explicitly define where AI should and shouldn’t be used. This means:</p><ul><li>Clear specifications of the optimal design domain</li><li>Hard limits on autonomy in high-stakes situations</li><li>Explicit human authority for final decisions</li><li>Recognition that some tasks should never be fully automated</li></ul><h4>5. Design for Recovery</h4><p>Plan for what happens when AI fails, not just how it performs when it works. This means:</p><ul><li>Clear error <a href=""https://pdhacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Detection-of-Errors-Course-for-Website.pdf"">detection and signaling</a></li><li>Graceful degradation rather than catastrophic failure</li><li>Human-understandable system states</li><li>Recovery protocols that don’t require AI expertise</li></ul><h4>6. Take Responsibility</h4><p>Maintain human accountability for AI-made decisions. This means:</p><ul><li>Someone is responsible for every consequential decision</li><li>Regular review of AI performance and errors</li><li>Willingness to roll back AI when it underperforms</li><li>Ethical guidelines that don’t hide behind algorithmic decisions</li></ul><h4>A Warning Circa 1990</h4><p>In 1990, James Reason warned of grave technological dangers:</p><blockquote><em>“A point has been reached in the development of technology where the greatest dangers stem not so much from the breakdown of a major component or from isolated operator errors, as from the insidious accumulation of delayed-action human failures occurring primarily within the organizational and managerial sectors.”</em></blockquote><p>If that was true in an age where the internet was still ascendent, TV the dominant form of entertainment, and phones and computers still geographically bound to the office and the home, it is exponentially more true today. Inscrutable design is a ticking time bomb for failure. AI has merely made that opacity more common, almost necessary.</p><figure><img alt=""An old, inscrutable nuclear control panel"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/793/0*7J2808IyNreqs36_.png"" /><figcaption>Source: Taproot.com</figcaption></figure><p>The proliferation of software layers, automated decision-making, globalized workflows, and complex interdependencies has increased both the number of resident pathogens and the difficulty of detecting them. Many failures today arise not from dramatic mistakes but from quiet misalignments: an assumption not documented, a procedure not updated, a dataset not validated, a safeguard added without understanding what it hides.</p><h4>The Designer’s New Responsibility</h4><p>Designers, therefore, inherit a new responsibility. Their task is not merely to make systems functional or efficient, but to make them <em>understandable</em>. To build systems with fewer hidden couplings. To reduce opacity. To create clear cause-effect relationships. To design for transparency, resilience, and recovery.</p><p>This responsibility extends beyond engineering. Latent errors emerge from management decisions, organizational cultures, incentives, and expectations. The designer cannot control every upstream choice, but the designer can insist upon principles like simplicity, clarity, conservatism, recoverability that reduce the accumulation of resident pathogens.</p><h4>Designing for Latent Complexity</h4><p>The imperative is one of prudence, not perfection. Good design recognizes what cannot be foreseen. It acknowledges the limits of prediction and control. It builds not merely for performance, but for recovery.</p><p>A system designed in this spirit can:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://diptendud.medium.com/understanding-resilience-in-system-design-5f4886eb8ad9"">Endure shocks without catastrophic failure</a></li><li>Adapt to inevitable new conditions and applications</li><li>Avoid the catastrophic alignment of latent failures</li><li>Preserve human agency without depending on individual heroism</li><li>Use technology without succumbing to its arrogance</li></ul><p>Such systems are not just safer. They are more humane, more comprehensible, and ultimately more worthy of the trust we place in them.</p><h4>The Path Forward</h4><p>The future of design, especially in the age of AI, requires us to hold two truths simultaneously:</p><p>First, technology, including AI, offers <a href=""https://www.online.uc.edu/blog/artificial-intelligence-ai-benefits.html"">genuine benefits</a>. It can enhance human capability, reduce errors in routine tasks, reveal patterns we couldn’t see, and free us from tedious work.</p><p>Second, technology, especially AI, introduces new failure modes, new latent errors, new paradoxes that make systems more fragile precisely when they appear most capable.</p><p>The solution is not to reject technology but to deploy it with wisdom inherited from generations of <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915002860"">systems thinking</a>, <a href=""https://www.hfes.org/"">human factors</a> research, and hard-won lessons from failures.</p><p>This means:</p><ul><li>Designing with awareness of latent failures</li><li>Understanding the paradox of automation</li><li>Respecting the conundrum of narrow performance windows</li><li>Applying conservative decision-making</li><li>Maintaining human <a href=""https://infusedinnovations.com/blog/responsible-ai-accountability"">accountability</a></li><li>Building for recovery, not just performance</li></ul><p>The designer’s task is not only to create intelligent systems, but to ensure those systems remain understandable, bounded, recoverable, and responsible. AI magnifies both the power of good design and the consequences of poor design. It is the ultimate test of our ability to design systems that align with human judgment, human values, and human limits.</p><p>The stakes have never been higher. The principles have never been clearer. The question is whether we have the wisdom and restraint to apply them before the next catastrophic failure forces us to learn these lessons again, at a cost we can ill afford.</p><p>The future of design is not about making systems smarter. It’s about making systems wiser. Systems that know their limits, acknowledge their failures, and preserve the human capabilities that technology promises to enhance but often erodes.</p><p>That is the philosophy we must carry forward into an age where artificial intelligence will touch nearly every aspect of our lives. The question is not whether AI will be powerful but whether we will be wise enough to design it responsibly.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=cc6733aedcfa"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/against-cleverness-cc6733aedcfa"">Against cleverness</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>We are building LLMs to sound human. When we add personality and emotional tone, we increase the risk that people will trust them like people. Design them as tools. Not as companions.</h4><figure><img alt=""cover image with article’s title “When tools pretend to be people” written upside down as the branding of Design, Explained"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*M3Cztq9D9r-XHNvmMIW7mg.png"" /></figure><p>People ask AI systems for therapy, moral judgment, and legal authority. The interfaces we design invite this behavior. Think about how these systems present themselves. Conversational framing. Continuous memory across sessions. First-person responses that sound like someone talking back to you. Every one of these is a design choice. We chose them. And these choices feed a reflex humans already have: we project intention onto objects and tools.</p><p>This reflex is old. We naturally anthropomorphize nonhuman entities, even when it’s clear we’re interacting with machines. We anthropomorphize vacuum cleaners. We name our cars. What’s different now is that we’re designing experiences that exploit this behaviour deliberately at scale.</p><blockquote><strong>Anthropomorphization </strong>is the human tendency to attribute human characteristics, behaviors, intentions, or emotions to nonhuman entities.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>AI humanization</strong> is an intentional design choice that encourages users to perceive AI systems as having human-like qualities such as personality, emotions, or consciousness.</blockquote><blockquote><em>— </em><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/humanizing-ai/""><em>Humanizing AI Is a Trap</em></a></blockquote><p>When you write system responses in first person, the output sounds like authority. When you add polite phrasing, it implies consideration behind the words. When you program emotional tone into responses, it suggests the system cares about the outcome. We added these features because they make the interaction feel natural. But natural here means human. And that’s the problem.</p><p>These systems sound fluent. They maintain context across long conversations. They respond without hesitation. For most people, that’s enough evidence the system understands them. Fluency looks like competence. Memory looks like understanding. The gap between “this is a tool” and “this is an entity” closes without anyone noticing.</p><p><strong>Here’s where I want you to pay attention. When we frame tools as agents, something shifts in how people use them. Responsibility moves. Decisions start to feel outsourced. When something goes wrong, the mistake feels external rather than shared.</strong></p><p>Good judgment develops through friction. You try something. It fails. You adjust. You learn what works through repetition and error. But if we build AI systems that absorb the posture of authority, users lose that friction. They stop checking. They stop questioning. They trust the output because the interface taught them to. This isn’t misuse. This is what we designed the system to encourage.</p><p>The consequences are already visible. In one of the most high-profile lawsuits recently filed against OpenAI, a California couple <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yd90g0q43o"">sued the company over the death of their teenage son</a>, alleging that ChatGPT encouraged him to take his own life. The lawsuit was filed by the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine and was the first legal action accusing OpenAI of wrongful death.</p><p>In a separate case, the suspect in a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/12/11/chatgpt-murder-suicide-soelberg-lawsuit/"">murder-suicide that took place in August</a> posted hours of his conversations with ChatGPT, which appear to have fueled the alleged perpetrator’s delusions. Professor Robin Feldman, Director of the AI Law &amp; Innovation Institute at the University of California Law, said more users struggle with AI psychosis as “Chatbots create the illusion of reality. It is a powerful illusion.”</p><p><strong>These aren’t edge cases. They’re what happens when systems we’ve designed blurs the boundaries between tools and agents.</strong></p><p>Someone asks an AI system for medical advice. The system responds fluently, confidently, in first person. “I recommend you try this treatment approach.” The person follows it. Not because they verified the information, but because the interaction felt like talking to a knowledgeable professional. The system created that feeling. We created that feeling. We built the confusion.</p><p>Platforms generating AI girlfriends are experiencing a massive growth in popularity, with millions of users. AI girlfriends can perpetuate loneliness because they dissuade users from entering into real-life relationships, alienate them from others, and, in some cases, induce intense feelings of abandonment.</p><blockquote>“Most of these searches are initiated by young single men drawn to AI girlfriends to combat loneliness and establish a form of companionship. These “girlfriends” are virtual companions powered by the increasingly sophisticated field of artificial intelligence.”</blockquote><blockquote><em>— </em><a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/its-not-just-in-your-head/202408/the-dangers-of-ai-generated-romance""><em>The Dangers of AI-Generated Romance</em></a></blockquote><p>Look at a knife. It has limits you can see and feel. Sharpness. Weight. The geometry of the edge. You never ask a knife what you should cook for dinner. You never ask if the meal was meaningful. Those decisions stay with you because the tool’s boundaries are obvious.</p><p>AI interfaces hide their limits. An empty chat box suggests no constraints. It looks ready for any question. That openness isn’t neutral. It’s an active design choice that tells people the system can handle whatever they type. Then when people misuse it, we blame them for not understanding the technology.</p><p>We need to give AI the same kind of framing we give physical tools. Clear affordances. Visible constraints. An obvious boundary between what the system produces and what we must decide.</p><p>Right now, most interfaces erase that boundary completely. The chat paradigm implies conversation. Conversation implies exchange between two minds. But one side is pattern matching at scale. The interface hides that difference.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*W8GmYrp7czyvcnaIQaABQg.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/haxtoolkit/ai-guidelines/"">Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction</a>, Microsoft.</figcaption></figure><h3>What would visible limits look like?</h3><p>Start with pronouns. Use third-person language in system responses. “Here is a summary” instead of “I think the main point is.” This single change removes the illusion of authorship. The output stops sounding like someone’s opinion and starts reading like generated text.</p><p>Show uncertainty. When the model lacks confidence, display that visibly. Not buried in a disclaimer, but in the response itself. Confidence scores. Probability ranges. Explicit markers that say “this answer is less reliable.” Make the gaps in knowledge visible instead of hiding them behind smooth conversations.</p><p>Reset context visibly. When you start a new session, make that boundary clear. Break the illusion that the system remembers you across time. Continuous memory makes the system feel like it knows you. That’s intimacy. Tools don’t need intimacy.</p><p>Stop calling output “messages.” Call it what it is: generated text. Label it. Frame it. Make the mechanical nature of the process visible in the interface itself.</p><p>I know what you’re thinking. These changes hurt engagement metrics. Anthropomorphic design works. People stay in the interface longer. They use it more often. Revenue scales with usage time. Making the system feel less human means people will use it less, and that conflicts with business goals. But engagement built on confusion carries costs we’re only starting to see.</p><p>Users develop dependency on systems they don’t understand. They delegate judgment to pattern recognition without realizing that’s what they’re doing. They mistake fluency for accuracy. They treat consistency as truth. And because the interface never taught them the boundaries, they don’t know when to stop trusting the output.</p><p><strong>When we erase the line between system output and human judgment in AI interfaces, we make the wrong design decisions. We’re building humanization into the system as strategy. We’re doing it on purpose because it increases engagement.</strong></p><p>You have agency here. When you design AI experiences, you decide how it presents itself. You control the pronouns in system responses. You choose whether to show confidence levels or hide them. You determine whether context persists invisibly or resets in clear ways.</p><p>These decisions shape how people understand the tool’s role and their own. They determine whether users develop judgment or dependency.</p><p>So ask yourself: where does the system end and where does judgment begin? In your current interface, can users see that line? Or have you deliberately blurred it to make the interaction feel smoother?</p><p>The chat paradigm became default because it felt intuitive. But that isn’t the same as honest.

<p>If 2025 was the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bob-haircut-trends-2026"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">year of the bob</a>, then 2026 is the year that the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/01/11843952/pixie-haircut-trends-2025"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">pixie cut </a>steals the spotlight back.  </p>



<p>Some might say that last year’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/korean-two-in-one-haircut-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">jaw-grazing cuts</a> were just leading up to this moment—and they’d probably be right. We can’t scroll through Instagram without spotting a meticulously carved <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/summer-haircut-trends-2025"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">pixie crop</a>, whether on a celebrity like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/teyanataylor/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Teyana Taylor</a> or an influencer like <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@yeslydimate?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Yesly Dimate</a>. </p>



<p>There isn’t a pixie cut that <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/davidboardman_/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">David Boardman</a> — a hairstylist located at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/cutlersalon/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cutler Salon</a> in New York — hasn’t mastered, and he has a sense of why it’s making a huge comeback in 2026: “It’s all about individuality and boldness,” Boardman tells R29. “It’s a style that blends softness and ease, allowing you to play with volume and texture.”  </p>



<p>Boardman says that you can “slim” it down for a sleek, tapered look or add fullness for a more dynamic shape. “Ultimately, the pixie cut accentuates your best features and brings out your personality in the most authentic way,” he says.  </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DLXiJTPqBMI/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Content creator Sia</a> proves that a pixie cut can be chic with this straight-across style. The chopped-in fringe adds a subtle edge, taking it from bowl-like to modern. To achieve that bitty, separated finish at the front, your stylist will cut vertically into the strands as a final touch. </p>

<p>This cut sits in a cozy space between a pixie and a shag. While it’s shorter at the back and sides, hairstylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DEpyRiHMMZt/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Justė Sidabraitė</a> has left plenty of length on top so the curls can be scrunched and mussed up using a texturizing product for added volume. </p>

<p>The way hairstylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/davidboardman_/?hl=en"">David Boardman</a> has cut this pixie makes the model’s hair look sculpted, almost as if it’s been carved. It’s all in the subtle short layers, the face-framing pieces, and the softer, longer sides. </p>

<p>One thing that comes with the territory of being a beauty director is that friends, family, and colleagues always tap me for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dermatologist-skincare-advice-2026"">skincare advice</a> — over text, email, or even in the office bathroom. Unlike a dermatologist or esthetician, I’m not a qualified expert, though I like to think I’ve got a little knowledge under my belt. But one skin dilemma that’s stumping even me is why everyone thinks their <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-inkey-list-advanced-retinal-serum-review"">skin looks so dull</a> right now. </p>



<p>Maybe it’s colder weather, central heating, or a lingering post-holiday skin hangover. Whatever the cause, dullness is a skin concern most of us are dealing with — so I asked a top dermatologist to break down what’s behind it and what actually helps. Without further ado, here’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/citric-acid-skincare-benefits"">how to make dull skin radiant</a> in a few easy steps, many of which you can do with products you likely already have at home. </p>



<h2>What does dull skin look like? </h2>



<p>Dermatologist <a href=""https://drophelia.com/"">Dr. Ophelia Veraitch</a> says that “dull skin” isn’t a medical or dermatologic diagnosis: “It’s a descriptive term used to explain skin that lacks clarity, even tone, and light reflection,” she explains. When the skin’s surface becomes uneven, she adds, it prevents light from reflecting properly, making the complexion appear flat or tired. </p>



<h2>What causes dull skin? </h2>



<p>I hate to break it to you, but there could be a long list of factors behind dull-looking skin. The first — and most obvious — is a buildup of dead skin cells, says Dr. Veraitch. Your skin naturally sheds dead skin cells as newer ones take their place, but some skin types might need a little help clearing them. More on that later.  </p>



<p>Another underlying cause of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-skincare-dry-skin-dermatologist-advice"">dull skin is dehydration</a>, says Dr. Veraitch. While drinking water throughout the day supports overall health and skin, topical hydration through lotions and serums is also important for combating dullness. </p>



<p>Environmental stressors are another factor. Pollution particles, Dr. Veraitch explains, can cling to dead skin cells, oil, and sweat, leaving behind an uneven, lackluster surface. </p>



<p>What’s more, skin inflammation — from conditions <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dermatologist-acne-skincare-advice"">like acne</a>, psoriasis, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sex-trigger-rosacea-flare-up"">or rosacea</a> — as well as hormonal skin changes such as melasma, and a compromised <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-soothing-barrier-support-serum-review"">skin barrier</a> (like dry or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tanning-beds-eczema-treatment-dermatologist-advice"">eczema-prone skin</a>) can all contribute to dullness. </p>



<h2>How can you get rid of dull skin and make it brighter? </h2>



<p>Dr. Veraitch suggests it’s important not to self-diagnose: “The most effective way to treat dull skin is to identify and manage any underlying cause,” she says. “This is why I always recommend seeing a dermatologist first — particularly if dullness is driven by inflammation, pigmentation, or a chronic skin condition.”  </p>



<p>Perhaps you only experience occasional breakouts and don’t have a chronic skin condition. If so, Dr. Veraitch says you can simply adjust your at-home skincare routine — and keeping it consistent plays an important role in improving skin brightness. </p>



<h2>What are the best skincare products for dull skin? </h2>



<p>First up: exfoliation — specifically, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/01/10846449/exfoliating-acids-skin-benefits-risks"">the chemical kind</a>. Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) are especially effective at lifting dull, dead skin cells and revealing healthy new ones. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-glycolic-acid-scalp-treatment-dandruff"">Glycolic acid</a> is arguably the most popular recommendation among skin experts for its ability to brighten the skin, minimize the appearance of hyperpigmentation, and smooth rough texture over time. A leave-on toner or serum applied at night is your best option. </p>



<p>A favorite of mine is <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fglycolic-acid-7-exfoliating-brightening-daily-toner-pimprod2007097"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating and Brightening Daily Toner</a>, which contains 7% glycolic acid. After cleansing, I pour a little onto a cotton pad and swipe it over my entire face and neck each evening, then follow with a simple, hydrating moisturizer. </p>



<p>Seven per cent glycolic acid is relatively high, so if you’re new to AHAs, go a little lower. Beauty editors wax lyrical about <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Ftatcha-the-texture-tonic-P479352%3F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tatcha The Texture Tonic AHA Liquid Exfoliating Treatment</a> with exfoliating glycolic acid and soothing Japanese mugwort, and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fgreen-plum-refreshing-toner-P517632%3FskuId%3D2896272%26icid2%3Dproducts%2520grid%3Ap517632%3Aproduct"">Beauty of Joseon Refreshing Toner</a>, with glycolic acid and moisturizing glycerin.  </p>



<p>If your skin is on the sensitive side, consider lactic acid. Its molecules are larger than those in glycolic acid, which means it absorbs into the skin more slowly and gently — making it a better choice for reactive skin types. Try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fsuper-serum-night-repair-5-in-1-face-serum-pimprod2041036%3Fsku%3D2615447"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Olay Super Serum Night Repair 5-in-1 Face Serum</a>, which combines lactic acid with skin-strengthening peptides, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Flactic-acid-10-ha-2-high-strength-exfoliating-serum-uneven-texture-pimprod2007103%3Fsku%3D2551156"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2%</a>, which contains 5% lactic acid and hyaluronic acid for added hydration. </p>



<p>Exfoliating acids make skin sensitive to sunlight, so be sure to wear a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-sunscreen-spf-reviews"">high-factor, broad-spectrum sunscreen</a> during the daytime.  </p>



<h2>Is retinol good for dull skin? </h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"">Retinoids like retinol, retinal</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tretinoin-skin-benefits-risks"">prescription-strength tretinoin</a> also help improve skin brightness. If you’re a beginner, the same rules apply: go low and slow. Try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fstarter-retinol-us-P520372"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Inkey List’s new Starter Retinol Serum</a> or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP427418"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion</a>. Both contain granactive retinoids, which are formulated to release slowly and gently into the skin, helping reduce irritation. </p>



<p>If you’re a pro, Dr. Veraitch recommends her <a href=""https://drophelia.com/products/anti-ageing-night-serum"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Night Serum</a> with tretinoin, which increases cell turnover and improves overall skin clarity.  </p>



<p>You can use retinol and exfoliating acids in the same routine, but it pays to be smart. The number one rule? Don’t layer them, which can leave your skin sore, sensitive, and dry. It’s better to use glycolic acid at night after cleansing, then introduce retinol a couple of nights later, always following with moisturizer and applying sunscreen in the morning. </p>



<h2>Are antioxidants good for dull skin? </h2>



<p>Once you’ve got your evening skincare figured out, Dr. Veraitch suggests adding one more ingredient to your morning routine: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vitamin-c-alternatives-sensitive-skin"">an antioxidant</a>. There are plenty to choose from, including <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-vitamin-c-serum"">vitamin C,</a> resveratrol, vitamin E, ferulic acid, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sunday-riley-b3-nice-niacinamide-serum-review"">and niacinamide</a>. Each works a little differently, but at their core, they all help protect skin from environmental aggressors — like smoke and UV — that can make it appear dull. </p>



<p>Arguably, the most popular antioxidant is vitamin C, which acts like a force field around the skin while brightening in the process. Dr. Veraitch often recommends <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dermstore.com%2Fp%2Fskinceuticals-c-e-ferulic-with-15-l-ascorbic-acid-vitamin-c-serum-30ml%2F11289609%2F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic</a> to her patients to protect against oxidative stress and boost radiance. It contains a trifecta of antioxidants: vitamin C, E, and ferulic acid. If you’d prefer to spend less, try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fbright-icon-vitamin-c-e-ferulic-serum-pimprod2052406%3Fsku%3D2640211"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">e.l.f. Bright Icon Vitamin C + E + Ferulic Serum</a>. For even better results, apply your antioxidant serum <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-sunscreen-spf-oily-skin"">before sunscreen</a> to maximize protection against UV rays. </p>



<h2>Which facials are good for dull skin? </h2>



<p>Lastly, if you have a bigger budget, Dr. Veraitch suggests a medical-grade treatment, which she says can significantly accelerate results. She likes to combine the <a href=""https://skinspanewyork.com/products/hydrafacial%C2%AE-platinum"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">HydraFacial Platinum</a> — a non-invasive facial that removes dead skin cells — with extractions. “I follow this with <a href=""https://www.clearandbrilliant.com/"">Clear + Brilliant</a>, a low-energy laser that gently but effectively brightens the skin, refines texture, and evens out skin tone.” Even better, there’s no downtime. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nail-biting-best-strengthening-products"">Growing out my nails</a> has never been my strong suit. Until recently, I could barely make it a few weeks before breaking one while doing something as untaxing as zipping up my jeans, let alone facing every nail’s nemesis: the ring pull on a can of Coke. </p>



<p>To give them a fighting chance, I’d take skin, hair, and nail supplements like they were going out of fashion, wear gloves while carrying out even the smallest of chores, and refrain from using my nails as tools to open my mail (we all do it). Frustratingly, none of those things worked. What I needed was some expert guidance. </p>



<p>Over the past year, I’ve collected tips and tricks from nail technicians, dermatologists, and even TikTok’s manicure obsessives. But I won’t gatekeep. These are the six simple, and most importantly, affordable pieces of advice I was given for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/japanese-manicure-nails-trend"">longer, stronger nails</a> that actually worked.  </p>



<h2>I chose cuticle oil over nail hardeners</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.drdanastern.com/"">Dr. Dana Stern</a>, board-certified dermatologist and founder of <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrdananails.com%2F"">Dr. Dana</a>, says that the cuticle is the nail’s natural protective seal. When it becomes dry and dehydrated, it’s compromised: “When this happens, water and moisture can enter the nail unit,” she says. “This causes all sorts of problems, including redness and swelling,” and eventually, the nail could grow irregularly: “Think white patches, bumps, thickening, and discoloration,” she says. </p>



<p>While most nail technicians will trim or remove dead cuticle skin during a manicure for aesthetic reasons, using cuticle oil still offers multiple benefits for the remaining skin surrounding your nails, as I’ve discovered: “Regular application of cuticle oil helps maintain hydration,” says consultant dermatologist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/drzainab.dermatology/?hl=en"">Dr. Zainab Laftah</a>. “Hydration benefits both the nail and surrounding skin by reducing brittleness, enhancing nail health, supporting healthy nail growth, and preventing infections,” she adds. </p>



<p>Unlike nail hardeners, which can make nails a little <em>too</em> hard, session manicurist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/amistreets/?hl=en"">Ami Streets</a> says that cuticle oil keeps nails flexible, withstanding everyday wear and tear. “Cuticle oil is the best product for growing nails — and my most recommended item to add to your beauty routine,” she says. </p>



<p>Dr. Dana recommends her <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrdananails.com%2Fproducts%2Fnourishing-cuticle-oil"">Nourishing Cuticle Oil</a>, with jojoba oil and indigo naturalis, a Chinese plant known to repair and strengthen the skin barrier. Complete with a handy roller ball for easy, drip-free application, it’s an oil I can vouch for, having used it down to the very last drop. Another of my favorites is <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fvitamin-e-nail-cuticle-oil-xlsImpprod17821169%3Fsku%3D2523202"">Sally Hansen Vitamin E Nail &amp; Cuticle Oil</a>, with moisturizing vitamin E and a dream team of nourishing plant oils. Streets also loves <a href=""https://amzn.to/42WVpGa"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">L’Occitane Shea Nail &amp; Cuticle Oil</a>, which is twice as moisturizing as the impressive hand cream in the same collection, and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjessicacosmetics.com%2Fproducts%2Fphenomen-oil"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jessica Phenomenoil</a>, another oil we’ve both used up.    </p>



<p>Besides ingredients, exactly how you use your cuticle oil matters, too. Streets says that a single drop on each cuticle is ample — and it’s best applied at night to give the oil time to absorb. Not only does cuticle oil hydrate deeper than hand creams, but Streets and Dr. Dana say that the massaging motion could help stimulate circulation and promote nail growth, too.  </p>





<h2>I switched from traditional gel to builder gel — or BIAB</h2>



<p>Not all gel nail polish is created equal. On my brittle nails, most would chip quickly. I’d then pick off the polish and damage my nails even further. It wasn’t until a fellow beauty journalist recommended <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hard-biab-manicure-strengthen-weak-nails"">Builder in a Bottle</a> — also known as BIAB or builder gel — that my nails grew long and strong. I’m almost a year in, and I haven’t had a single chip or break. They’re growing so quickly that I always ask my nail technician to cut them down. </p>



<p>“Builder in a Bottle is a specific type of gel that lends strength and structure to natural nails,” explains Streets. Thanks to its stronger base, Streets says that it’s a great option for those who want to reinforce their nails while trying to grow them, as they can last up to three weeks. Another great thing about BIAB is that it can be infilled, says Streets. This involves getting the grown-out gap near your cuticles filled in with more gel, rather than having to fully remove the polish each time. “This allows natural nails to maintain growth,” adds Streets, but she recommends a maximum of two to three repeated infills before having a short break to keep your nails healthy and happy.</p>



<p>Thanks to BIAB’s harder, more durable finish, Dr. Dana says that it not only serves as a “protective armor” for nails, but it typically has a forgiving, less damaging removal process by soaking off, so it tends to be more advantageous than other nail enhancements like acrylics. “I’ve seen patients who use BIAB and have very healthy nails in comparison to my patients who wear acrylics and do constant soak-off gels,” she says, adding that BIAB’s durable nature also makes it a good option for nail biters. </p>



<h2>I addressed my vitamin D deficiency</h2>



<p>When a blood test revealed that my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vitamin-d-myth-sunscreen-dark-skin"">vitamin D</a> levels were low, I began taking a 2000 IU vitamin D supplement daily alongside my trusty omega-3, 6, and 9. While there are multiple health benefits to both, Dr. Laftah points out that they could have additional advantages for nails: “Addressing a vitamin D deficiency can improve nail health as low levels can result in brittle nails,” she tells me. Interestingly, <a href=""https://ijdvl.com/nails-in-nutritional-deficiencies/"">one small study</a> suggests that hapalonychia — a condition that causes nails to become soft and prone to breakage — has been associated with vitamin D deficiency. As for omega-3? “Incorporating omega-3 fatty acids into your diet may also benefit nails by providing essential nutrients that support overall nail strength and integrity,” Dr. Laftah says.</p>



<p>However, Dr. Dana points out that no robust studies prove that vitamins or supplements benefit nail health. But since nails are made of keratin (a type of protein), she suggests that if your diet lacks sufficient protein, it may be worth considering protein supplementation to improve the condition of your nails. Streets also advises incorporating more protein into your diet and drives home the importance of staying hydrated. </p>



<p>Before adding supplements to your routine, consult your doctor to ensure they’re safe and suitable for you.</p>



<h2>I took hand cream very seriously</h2>



<p>Previously, I’d only use lotion when my hands were uncomfortably dry and on the verge of cracking. Over the past few months, though, I’ve <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-hand-cream-dry-skin"">taken moisturizing very seriously</a>, and I’m convinced that keeping my hands adequately hydrated throughout the day has also benefited my nails. </p>



<p>I was right. For clients who want longer, stronger nails, Dr. Laftah recommends moisturizing regularly to maintain hydration. “Using a nourishing and hydrating hand cream can help,” adds Streets. “Not only does it keep skin in a supple and soft condition, but it can also act as a protective barrier against environmental stressors,” — like cold weather. Streets says that dry, cracked skin and cuticles can lead to infection or weak nail growth, so consistent daily use of a moisturizing product is essential. </p>



<p>If you want fast hydration without the sticky feel, I love <a href=""https://amzn.to/4jIh9eJ"">Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Hand Cream</a>. If your hands are especially dry, my all-time favorite hand lotion is <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fca%2Fen%2Fproduct%2Fhand-creams-P307907"">L’Occitane Shea Butter Hand Cream</a>. The silky soft feeling sticks around for hours — even post-hand-wash. “On application, make sure you use a massaging motion,” advises Streets. “It can help to boost blood flow to hands and cuticles, which supports new nail growth even further.”</p>



<h2>I started using a glass nail file</h2>



<p>Dr. Dana believes that many nail files, particularly traditional, rough emery boards, can be too abrasive for natural nails, potentially causing “microscopic tears” that lead to splits and breakage. That’s where glass or crystal nail files come in. On days when I gave my nails a break from BIAB, I’d file away rough edges with a glass file, which I’m certain is kinder on nails. </p>



<p>“In contrast [to emery boards], glass creates a perfectly smooth, split-free edge to the nail,” says Dr. Dana, who uses the <a href=""https://amzn.to/3CH5w7g"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Precision Glass File</a>. Likewise, Streets believes that a glass nail file is a worthwhile investment for at-home manicures: “They provide a finer and more controlled filing experience, and the smooth edges help seal the keratin layers at the nail’s edge, preventing splitting, peeling, and snagging that can occur when using a rougher emery board.” What’s more, Streets points out that glass nail files are non-porous and can be washed or sanitized between uses.</p>



<h2>Lastly, I exfoliated my nails</h2>



<p>With its ability to exfoliate the skin, leaving it smoother and brighter, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-glycolic-acid-scalp-treatment-dandruff"">glycolic acid</a> is a staple in many skincare routines, but it can benefit your natural nails, too. In between BIAB appointments, I’ve often applied a glycolic acid toner to my nails and cuticles using a cotton swab, then followed with a glug of cuticle oil. The result? Fewer flakes and a stronger, smoother canvas for nail polish. If you’d rather not DIY, try the Dr. Dana <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fnail-renewal-system-set-30-value%2F7951571%3Forigin%3Dcategory-personalizedsort%26breadcrumb%3DHome%252FBrands%252FDr.%2520Dana%26color%3D000"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nail Renewal System</a>, a once-weekly, 3-step nail system that boasts glycolic acid, a nail primer, and a hydrating gel-oil to reveal healthy, hydrated, and shiny nails, fast. “It’s perfect for brittle, peeling, weak nails, post-gel damage, or if you simply want a gorgeous, healthy-looking shine without having to go to the salon,” says Dr. Dana. </p>

<p>As a beauty director, it’s hard not to be a skeptic. With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-skincare-dry-skin-dermatologist-advice"">dermatologists on speed dial</a> and cosmetic chemists just an Instagram DM away, I can bust dubious <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/acne-skin-condition-tips-advice-dermatologist"">skincare myths</a> (sorry, you can’t put <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/skincare-products-you-dont-need"">collagen back into your skin</a>), and get their opinion on ingredients (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hyaluronic-acid-skin-benefits"">hyaluronic acid</a> isn’t all it’s cracked up to be). But having such a wealth of information at my fingertips means that I’ve become very particular about which products earn a spot on my bathroom shelf. </p>



<p>I’m not sold on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/skincare-products-you-dont-need"">neck cream</a>, nor am I a huge fan of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hair-care-products-you-dont-need"">hair gummies</a>, and until recently, there wasn’t any room for hair growth serums, shampoos, or conditioners in my routine. Honestly, I thought they were futile. Here’s the thing: Having spoken to a handful of trichologists over the years, I know that hair growth is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-grow-long-healthy-hair"">mostly down to genetics</a>. When it comes to hair growth shampoos, especially, they tend to sit on the scalp for a short amount of time, and whether they actually do anything has long been disputed by experts. That said, it’s been hard to ignore the buzz around one hair growth brand lately. </p>



<p>Enter: <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.typebea.com%2F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Typebea</a>, the invention of singer-songwriter Rita Ora and Anna Lahey, also the founder of supplement brand <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.vidaglow.com%2F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Vida Glow</a>.</p>



<p>When Typebea launched in April of 2024, it took many of my beauty editor peers by surprise. A handful extolled the virtues of the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.typebea.com%2Fproducts%2Fstrength-length-conditioner-1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Strength + Length Conditioner, $26</a>, which had made their hair feel “like silk”, while others loved that the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.typebea.com%2Fproducts%2Fovernight-boosting-peptide-1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Overnight Boosting Peptide Serum, $52</a>, gave them three times as much volume. Unconvinced, however, I put my samples aside. It wasn’t until I’d booked in for a salon blowout, where I happened to have my hair washed and professionally styled using the brand’s products, that I sat up and took note. It was probably the best my lengths had looked (voluminous and shiny) — and felt — (thick and strong) in a long time. I incorporated the shampoo, conditioner, and serum into my haircare routine that weekend. </p>





<p>After a month or so of using all three products, I started to get compliments on how long and healthy my hair appeared: “Are you wearing extensions?” and “Didn’t you have a bob a few moments ago?” are just a couple of common questions I’ve fielded of late. A couple of months since I started using Typebea — and now on my second bottle of shampoo — my friends can’t quite believe how quickly my hair is growing. Even my hairdresser, who listened to me moan about how my lengths took forever to reach my shoulders, is stunned by the abundance of new baby hairs that have suddenly sprouted along my hairline. </p>



<p>Besides <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grow-out-bob-hair-care-expert-advice"">taking more care of my hair</a> (not going to bed with it wet, investing in a microfibre towel), using the shampoo, conditioner, and serum consistently is the only significant change to my routine. It got me thinking: <em>Have I got hair growth products all wrong? And what is it about Typebea that seems to work so well?</em></p>



<h2>What are the ingredients inside Typebea hair growth products?</h2>



<p>Without subjecting you to a science lesson, both the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.typebea.com%2Fproducts%2Fovernight-boosting-peptide-1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">G1 Overnight Boosting Peptide Hair Serum, $52</a>, and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.typebea.com%2Fproducts%2Fstrength-length-shampoo"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Strength and Length Shampoo, $26</a>, feature the ingredients baicapil, salicylic acid, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vitamin-b5-hyaluronic-acid-serum-combination"">provitamin B5</a>. The brand claims that they promote hair growth, exfoliate the scalp, and keep it moisturized respectively. The <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.typebea.com%2Fproducts%2Fstrength-length-conditioner-1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Strength and Length Conditioner, $26</a>, also boasts baicapil and provitamin B5, with the addition of plant-based keratin, said to smooth frizz, repair damage, and enhance shine. Intrigued — and still a little bit doubtful — I asked independent trichologists for their thoughts on the ingredients inside everything. Mainly, I wanted to know whether I really <em>did</em> have some genuinely game-changing hair growth products on my hands. </p>



<h2>What is baicapil — and is it good for hair growth?</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.ukhairconsultants.com/"">Eva Proudman</a>, consultant trichologist FIT IAT, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grow-out-bob-hair-care-expert-advice"">previously told R29</a> that baicapil is a plant-based ingredient derived from scutellaria baicalensis, a Chinese herb. “[This herb] has antioxidant properties that can support hair health,” said Proudman. “It is normally combined with other botanicals such as soy, which hydrates the hair and scalp, and can improve hair texture by smoothing the cuticle,” essentially making lengths appear shinier. Proudman pointed out that wheat sprouts are also used in the products. “Wheat sprouts can help to improve texture by reducing the effects of free radicals [think UV and pollution] and provide hydration and a smoothing [effect] for the hair fibre.”  </p>



<p>Jade Summers, resident trichologist at <a href=""https://hareandbone.co.uk/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hare &amp; Bone</a> salon, told me that she isn’t too familiar with baicapil, but she drew my attention to a 2018 study, which evaluated the effects of the ingredient in <a href=""https://www.opastpublishers.com/open-access-articles/a-study-to-evaluate-the-efficacy-of-baicapil-formulations-in-treatment-of-telogen-effluvium.pdf"">telogen effluvium</a>, essentially hair shedding. The research presented positive outcomes for reducing hair shedding, promoting growth, and overall hair density — basically, the amount of hair per square inch on the scalp. </p>



<p>Less hair shedding is certainly something I’ve noticed since using all three products. While losing some hair is completely normal, there are far fewer strands to collect from the bottom of the shower when I wash it. I’m putting this down to the scalp serum, which is so lightweight that it doesn’t feel like you’ve got anything on your scalp at all. Before bed, I simply part my hair, drop the serum onto my scalp, and massage it in. My hair also looks and feels thicker, which I’ll attribute to the shampoo. When I rinse it out, it feels as though my strands have tripled in size, and this volume persists even when I rough-dry and style my hair afterward. </p>



<h2>What is salicylic acid — and is it good for hair growth?</h2>



<p>Besides baicapil, Typebea’s shampoo features salicylic acid, an alpha hydroxy acid (or AHA), which penetrates into the skin on the scalp to exfoliate on a deeper level. Summers explained that salicylic acid breaks down build-up on the scalp (think sebum, remnants of dry shampoo, and other styling products) to unclog hair follicles and create a clean environment for healthy hair growth. Salicylic acid also exfoliates dead skin cells, said Proudman, helping to keep the follicles clear. </p>



<p>One of the most useful things I’ve learned from trichologists is that healthy, stronger hair is largely dependent on the condition of the scalp, which is why it’s recommended to wash it <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hair-training-tiktok-trend"">as regularly as you can manage</a>. Some experts liken the scalp to a flowerbed: If you’re looking after the soil, you’re looking after the flowers that grow from it. For that reason, salicylic acid is something I look for in all shampoo formulations. The fact that it’s pretty high up on the ingredient list in Typebea’s shampoo is most likely why my persistent flakes have subsided — and why my hair looks and feels so much healthier.  </p>



<h2>What is provitamin B5 — and is it good for hair growth?</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11852646.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>The third star ingredient in Typebea’s shampoo and conditioner is provitamin B5, also known as panthenol. Summers pinpointed a 2021 study, which concluded that the ingredient can “elongate the anagen phase in hair follicles” — in essence, the active growth phase. The more time hair stays in this phase, the longer it can grow. Besides this, Proudman explained that provitamin B5 can encourage hair to hold on to moisture, therefore smoothing it, enhancing shine, and even protecting it from damage. </p>



<p>With this information in mind, I’m convinced that the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.typebea.com%2Fproducts%2Fstrength-length-conditioner-1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Strength and Length Conditioner</a> keeps split ends at arm’s length, and even though I’ve been using more heat on my hair, it doesn’t feel dry in the slightest. </p>



<p>Lastly, while most conditioners feature silicones for shine and softness, Typebea swaps these for plant-based keratin. “[Plant-based keratin is] great to smooth and hydrate the hair without any concern of build-up,” said Summers. I have nothing against silicones in haircare — actually, I welcome them — but they can weigh fine hair down if not washed out properly, so plant-based keratin is probably a better choice for those with a similar concern.</p>



<h2>Are Typebea products any good?</h2>



<p>Science aside, the anecdotal evidence for Typebea’s hair growth products is mounting. Don’t just take my word for it. On TikTok, users are looking to the scalp serum to <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@txzthai/video/7400357522659396869"">regrow edges</a>, while other reviewers are taking to Sephora to <a href=""https://www.sephora.co.uk/p/typebea-g1-overnight-boosting-peptide-serum-100ml"">share impressive results</a>, complete with before and after pictures. </p>



<p>Over the years, I think I’ve built a strong reputation for telling you when certain products or ingredients aren’t worth your time and hard-earned money. But even I have to admit that Typebea is a valuable investment for those who want longer, stronger, and healthier hair. In fact, I’m gearing up to open my third bottle of shampoo this week…</p>

<p>It was the first time in 12 years that Gaby had <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/estranged-dad-cancer"">spoken to her father</a>. It didn’t go well. Her sister had persuaded her to hear him out after years of trying. <em>Okay</em>, thought Gaby — so long as she didn’t have to promise a certain outcome. Sitting across from her dad, she felt her heart sink when he said he “didn’t want to drag stuff back up,” as he put it. The thing is, she did want to discuss things from the past. It was important to her, if they were to become civil at the end of this, though that outcome was looking increasingly unlikely with each minute that passed. </p>



<p>“He denied multiple events, lied, denied knowledge of my mental health issues and told me it seemed like there was nothing he could do to change my mind about our relationship, so why should he bother,” remembers Gaby, who is 25 and didn’t want to share her last name. He didn’t apologize for anything and spoke about his own upbringing in a way that Gaby felt was designed to “guilt trip” her into having a relationship with him. “I had the conversation as a favor to my sister. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/07/11466376/latine-family-parent-estrangement"">I will not be doing that again</a>. He seems to have worked on himself over the years from what my sister says, but not in regards to his relationship with me.” Gaby feels that further efforts to reconcile would be futile. </p>



<p>Estrangement is so painful because good familial relationships are automatically expected. In the years that <a href=""https://variety.com/2024/music/news/oasis-break-up-liam-noel-gallagher-fights-1236118668/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Liam and Noel Gallagher, the famously feuding brothers</a> of Britpop band Oasis, were in bitter separation, both brothers were asked repeatedly in interviews if they’d work things out. In a similar vein, this week, Brooklyn Peltz Beckham also addressed his own familial situation by making a statement on Instagram saying he “didn’t want to reconcile” with his family, the Beckhams. There’s something about troubled <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/youngest-child-stereotypes"">family relationships</a> that we can’t let rest in the way we do when other relationships break down. Confronting it is painful. The Gallaghers are a unique case, though. Their recent reunion in summer ’24 was made to look easy and their former conflicts a source of entertainment. They also probably had a big motivator: money. Regular estranged or tense family relationships don’t get that material and emotional support. In the US, there are a few (though not many) organizations supporting estranged families, including Together Estranged and PEAK. The UK’s leading charity in helping estranged people cope, Stand Alone, ceased operations in April this year due to financial struggle, and nothing has yet taken its place. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>I get pressured by other family members all the time to reconcile.</p><cite>Ebony, 29</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Even if someone dealing with estrangement has contact with other family members, those family members often aren’t equipped or neutral enough to know how to help. Sometimes, involvement from others makes the whole thing one messy hotpot of guilt-tripping, arguments, resentment and a heat that will burn the tongue. Twenty-nine-year-old Ebony, who doesn’t want to share her real name, is estranged from her cousins, who she grew up with and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/siblings-large-age-gaps"">viewed as her brother and sister</a>. They cut her off last year after a wider family feud involving their parents and grandparents. “I get pressured by other family members all the time both directly and indirectly to reconcile,” she says. “There are multiple family members who have tried talking to my cousins, encouraging them to reach out to me. This upsets me, because no one should be going and asking someone to reconcile with someone else. If that person has to be forced, then it’s not worth it. I’m trying my hardest to not let it affect my relationship with my other cousins who I am also close with. But unfortunately it does affect it and it does make things awkward.” The situation has damaged Ebony’s mental health; before the point of no contact, she felt used as a metaphorical “punching bag” by her estranged cousins when the relationship became turbulent. Even if reconciliation were an option, it wouldn’t be easy, and she’d have to confront the verbal abuse she was subject to. </p>



<p>Financially, people who are disconnected from their families lack a support system many of us take for granted. While not every family has the means to help out, even if the will is there, lots of us do have the luxury of being able to return home for a period when life gets hard — when romantic relationships end, for example, or we lose our jobs. Therapist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/eimearom_therapy/"">Eimear O’Mahony</a> says: “Many people who experience estrangement do not have the financial, physical, emotional support of family. This can mean there is a higher rate of financial worry and struggle in comparison to others who have family to help with kids or who know they will have inheritance in the future.” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>It’s possible to love a family member and need to set limits due to their behavior.</p><cite>Liz Kelly</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Therapy can help with the guilt that often comes from cutting contact with family. Writer Fern Schumer Chapman, who was estranged from her brother for over 40 years, wrote in her book <em>Brothers, Sisters, Strangers</em> that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eldest-daughter-syndrome-oldest-sibling-family-responsibilities"">when siblings cut ties</a>, they’re left in “a world of secrecy and shame,” even if they’ve made the right decision for themselves. The feelings that come with this decision are complex and will vary by person depending on why they’ve chosen to cut ties. Liz Kelly, therapist and author of <a href=""https://a.co/d/5PMM7E8""><em>This Book Is Cheaper Than Therapy</em></a>, says: “It is very common for people who cut ties with family members to experience guilt. They may have received societal, cultural or religious messages to put family over everything. It’s challenging to make a different choice when facing that pressure.” </p>



<p>People are complicated and some still care about family they’ve cut out of their lives. “It’s possible to love a family member and need to set limits due to their behavior,” Kelly explains. “For example, you might love your father, who is addicted to alcohol, and make a decision not to visit him to protect yourself and your children from his violent behavior. These decisions are complicated. Most people who cut ties with a family member typically do so after much thought, deliberation and previous attempts to continue and repair the relationship.” O’Mahony adds that estrangement can feel similar to grieving at times, because “it often doesn’t feel natural to the human mind to accept that we choose to not see, for example, a parent.”</p>



<p>Gaby feels lucky that her mom respects her decision to remain estranged from her dad but she can sense that her mom hopes they will have a relationship one day. Even that must feel like a weight to carry. “Over the years there were a few attempts within the family to ‘fix’ things, including family counseling. But each time he would say or do something that reaffirmed that I didn’t like him as a person, didn’t think he was a good dad and didn’t want him in my life,” Gaby says. </p>



<p>Some people are better off not reconciling, even with the emotional and financial strife it may cause. O’Mahony says it boils down to whether rebuilding the relationship would be “harmful or detrimental to the physical, emotional or psychological health of an individual.” These cases often involve trauma, abuse, neglect and harm, she explains. “Many people who decide to cut contact will go through waves of wondering, <em>Am I doing the right thing?</em> so the decision to not reconcile is only one part of a very complex process. It is so important to have support, understanding and non-judgement.” Lots of O’Mahony’s clients experience stigma surrounding this subject — friends don’t know what to say when it is brought up, or when questions like “Who are you spending Christmas with?” are asked. “The judgement, confusion and lack of understanding from others can be very harmful.” O’Mahony recommends therapy for those who can access or afford it. As Gaby puts it regarding her own situation: “As time has gone on, I have only experienced more reasons to keep him out of my life.” The best thing we can do is let estranged people live in peace with their choices. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951379.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>We begin this week under the energy of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cancer-new-moon-horoscope-2026-meaning-effects"">first New Moon of 2026</a>, which arrives on January 18th at 2:52 p.m. EST at 28 degrees Capricorn. New Moons mark beginnings, and starting the year with a Capricorn New Moon at the very <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">end of Capricorn season</a> sets a powerful, intentional tone for what we are building next. This lunation forms a close trine to Uranus in Taurus at 27 degrees, blending Capricorn’s slow, steady commitment with Uranus’ capacity for meaningful change. </p>



<p>While Capricorn New Moons typically emphasize patience and long-term planning, Uranus adds a spark of momentum, suggesting that some intentions may manifest faster than expected. Especially between now and late April, as Uranus prepares to shift signs, what you commit to now can move from vision to reality more quickly if you are willing to do the work. </p>



<p>This is a New Moon week that rewards specificity and embodiment. Rather than vague resolutions, the universe responds best to grounded detail. If you’re setting intentions around career, finances, relocation, or lifestyle changes, write them as if they’re already in motion. Imagine how your days feel, where you live, who surrounds you, and how stability shows up in your body. Capricorn energy asks for structure, while Uranus rewards courage. Together, they remind us that practical planning and bold reinvention do not have to be opposites. This is an ideal moment to make realistic plans for change that still leave room for surprise and evolution. </p>



<p>On January 19th, the sun enters Aquarius, ushering in the first full week of Aquarius Season and shifting the collective mood. While both Capricorn and Aquarius are ruled by Saturn, their expressions are very diﬀerent. Capricorn is focused on responsibility, tradition, and mastery through discipline, while Aquarius brings an airier, more innovative approach to growth. As we move from Earth to Air, the focus widens from personal ambition to collective impact. </p>



<p>On January 20th, Saturn in Pisces forms a supportive sextile to Uranus in Taurus, helping us integrate long-term dreams with tangible change. This alignment supports progress that is both compassionate and sustainable, reminding us that real innovation works best when it considers emotional, spiritual, and communal needs. </p>



<p>The week continues to build momentum as Mercury enters Aquarius on January 20th, followed by Mars entering Aquarius on January 23rd after six weeks in Capricorn. This marks a collective shift from personal responsibility to shared vision, from solo effort to collaborative action. </p>



<p>Adding to the significance, this is the final full week of Neptune in Pisces, with Neptune lingering at 29 degrees all week long. Neptune’s harmonious connection to the Capricorn New Moon encourages us to move beyond dreaming and into doing. After nearly fifteen years of reflection, spiritual exploration, and emotional sensitivity, this moment asks us to apply what we have learned. Think back to where you were in 2011 when Neptune first entered Pisces and consider how your understanding of compassion and boundaries has evolved. </p>



<p>This week invites gratitude for those lessons, paired with the resolve to choose what truly supports your growth moving forward. It’s less about imagining a better future and more about committing to building it. </p>

<p>The moon’s trine to Uranus in Taurus shakes up your subconscious and healing zone, helping you release old fears or habits that have been quietly blocking your growth. Meanwhile, Neptune’s supportive energy from your career sector reminds you that vulnerability and ambition are not opposites.

<p>The moon’s trine to Uranus in Taurus highlights shifts around shared resources, emotional bonds, or financial entanglements, suggesting that changes at home may be tied to deeper conversations about trust and support.

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>

What narratives are you ready to release, and which ones are worth committing to long-term? </p>

The shift from Capricorn’s seriousness to Aquarius’ emotional honesty can feel freeing. This is your cue to stop intellectualizing your feelings and start building a home, internal or external, that actually supports who you’re becoming. </p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, are you ready to secure the bag in a way that actually feels sustainable and self- respecting? This week’s Capricorn New Moon on January 18th lights up your money, values, and self-worth sector, calling for a reset around how you earn, spend, and recognize your own value. Because this New Moon lands at the very end <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Capricorn Season</a>, it is giving “no more excuses” energy around finances and stability. </p>



<p>The moon’s trine to Uranus in Taurus shakes up your work and routine sector, suggesting that changes to how you structure your days could directly impact your income or confidence. Neptune’s supportive influence from your home and emotional foundations sector adds intuition and emotional clarity, reminding you that true security starts from within. This is a powerful moment to set intentions around financial independence, healthier money habits, and valuing yourself without needing external validation. </p>



<p>As the week unfolds, Aquarius Season begins on January 19th, activating your communication, learning, and social sector. After weeks of focusing on stability, the energy lightens and speeds up. Mercury enters Aquarius on the 20th, bringing exciting conversations, ideas, and opportunities to share your voice more freely. </p>



<p>Then on January 23rd, Mars enters Aquarius, giving you the confidence to speak up, pitch an idea, or initiate conversations you may have been overthinking. The transition from Capricorn’s seriousness to Aquarius’ curiosity feels energizing. This is your reminder that when your mindset shifts, everything else can follow. </p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, this is <em>your </em>moment. The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th lands in your identity, confidence, and personal power sector, marking a full reset around who you are becoming in 2026. Because this New Moon arrives at the very <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">end of your season</a>, it carries major main-character energy. This isn’t about tweaking goals, it’s about redefining yourself. <br /><br />The moon’s trine to Uranus in Taurus lights up your creativity, joy, and self-expression sector, encouraging you to take risks that feel exciting rather than purely strategic. Meanwhile, Neptune’s supportive influence from your communication and mindset sector helps you articulate your vision with clarity and intuition. This is a rare moment where reinvention feels both grounded and liberating. Set intentions that reflect who you are now, not who you had to be to survive. </p>



<p>The energy shifts quickly as Aquarius Season begins on January 19th, activating your money, values, and self-worth sector. After weeks of self-focus, attention turns to how you support yourself materially and emotionally. Mercury enters Aquarius on the 20th, bringing conversations, insights, or decisions around finances and boundaries. </p>



<p>Then on January 23rd, Mars enters Aquarius, motivating you to take action around earning, negotiating, or advocating for what you deserve. The move from Capricorn’s seriousness to Aquarius’ innovation feels refreshing. This is your reminder that stability does not come from overworking alone, but from aligning your effort with your values. </p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, are you feeling it already… that quiet urge to pull back before you glow up? This week’s Capricorn New Moon on January 18th activates your rest, healing, and subconscious sector, signaling a powerful reset happening behind the scenes. Because this New Moon lands at the very end <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Capricorn Season</a>, it is giving “closure before the breakthrough” energy. </p>



<p>The moon’s trine to Uranus in Taurus stirs changes around home, family, or emotional security, while Neptune’s supportive influence from your money and values sector reminds you that rest is not laziness, it’s strategy. This is an ideal moment to set intentions around releasing old habits, burnout, or self-sabotaging patterns that have quietly run their course. What you let go of now makes space for who you are about to become. </p>



<p>Then the energy flips as the sun enters your sign on January 19th, officially kicking oﬀ Aquarius Season and putting the spotlight back on you. Mercury enters Aquarius on the 20th, sharpening your voice and helping you articulate ideas you have been sitting on. By January 23rd, Mars enters Aquarius too, giving you the confidence and momentum to act on those ideas without second-guessing yourself. The shift from Capricorn’s heaviness to Aquarius’ clarity feels like coming up for air. This is your reminder that you do not need permission to move diﬀerently. Lead with authenticity, trust your instincts, and let the world catch up. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, are you ready to get serious about your dreams without losing the magic? This week’s Capricorn New Moon on January 18th lights up your friendship, community, and long-term goals sector, asking you to reset the way you envision your future. Because this New Moon lands at the very end <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Capricorn Season</a>, it is giving “this is the plan” energy. </p>



<p>The moon’s trine to Uranus in Taurus sparks unexpected conversations, ideas, or opportunities that shift how you connect and collaborate with others. Meanwhile, Neptune, your ruling planet, sits in its final degrees in your sign and forms a supportive link to this New Moon, making this an especially emotional and meaningful moment for you. You’re being asked to turn intuition into intention and to commit to dreams that feel both inspired and achievable. </p>



<p>The vibe changes as Aquarius Season begins on January 19th, activating your rest, healing, and behind-the-scenes sector. After thinking big about the future, the universe encourages you to slow down and recharge. Mercury enters Aquarius on the 20th, bringing clarity through reflection, journaling, or quiet conversations, while Mars follows on January 23rd, helping you take gentle but intentional action toward better boundaries and self-care. </p>



<p>This shift from Capricorn’s pressure to Aquarius’ detachment feels like an emotional exhale. Trust that rest is part of the process. You don’t have to rush what is unfolding, especially when you’re already aligning with something bigger than you imagined… </p>

<p>If you’ve ever loved a beauty product, then you’ve likely also experienced what it felt like to lose it. Whether it was a beloved moisturizer that was discontinued or a reformulated lipstick shade that was never quite the same, we’ve all been there. And if you’re one of the thousands (I can only assume) of people who adore Armani’s Luminous Silk Foundation, what comes next might be hard to hear, but you’ve been warned. </p>



<p>After launching in 2000 (turn of the century!), Armani Luminous Silk Foundation skyrocketed to popularity, becoming one of the most frequently name-dropped products among celebrities like Gemma Chan and Kim Kardashian, and makeup artists like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tobimakeup/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tobi Henney</a>. (One 2020 statistic even reported the brand <a href=""https://www.thezoereport.com/beauty/armani-beauty-luminous-silk-foundation-sells-1000-bottles-every-day-heres-why-44969437"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">sold 1,000 bottles of Luminous Silk</a> per day.) So you may be wondering why Armani would replace an existing bestseller, even after 25 years — and you’d be right to do so. But before you run to your nearest Sephora to stock up on your old shade, here’s everything you need to know about the new version of the cult classic, <a href=""https://www.giorgioarmanibeauty-usa.com/makeup/face/foundation/luminous-silk-natural-glow-blurring-foundation/ww-01019-arm.html?dwvar_ww-01019-arm_color=6%20-%20Medium%2C%20Neutral%20Olive&amp;dwvar_ww-01019-arm_size=30ml"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Luminous Silk Natural Glow Blurring Foundation</a>. </p>

<h2>Why did Armani reformulate its iconic Luminous Silk Foundation? </h2>



<p>As the name suggests, the OG Armani Luminous Silk Foundation was touted as a medium-to-full coverage product that enhanced skin’s natural radiance. The upgraded formula, <a href=""https://www.giorgioarmanibeauty-usa.com/makeup/face/foundation/luminous-silk-natural-glow-blurring-foundation/ww-01019-arm.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Luminous Silk Natural Glow Blurring Foundation</a>, captures the same soft-glow finish with a thinner, more blendable texture. Then, there is the addition of skincare-first ingredients like niacinamide to brighten and curb oil production — an especially welcome addition for those prone to oily skin like myself, who notice that foundation can sometimes enhance shine and greasiness. Another notable addition to the foundation is glycerin, an emollient and humectant that helps draw in moisture and lock it in place. </p>



<h2>What’s different about Armani’s new Luminous Silk Natural Glow Blurring Foundation? </h2>



<p>Whether you’re hitting a red carpet (relatable!) or simply looking for a workhorse complexion perfector for every day, Armani Luminous Silk had mass appeal in spades due to its silky texture, moderate coverage, and luxe cachet. (Put simply, having this in your makeup bag made you That Girl.)  </p>



<p>But as is often the case, not everyone was convinced. Some reviewers wanted a better finish for drier skin types, while others said it oxidized quickly. Since its launch, countless brands have introduced foundations powered by increasingly high-tech formulas. With this in mind, Rena Hayashi, Armani Beauty’s head of research and development, reveals that the reformulation was inevitable. “Even for an icon like Luminous Silk, consumer expectations evolve,” Hayashi says of the four-year reformulation process. She adds, “The driving inspiration was to meet today’s demand for foundations that offer an even more seamless, true-to-skin match and act as an extension of one’s skincare routine, not just makeup.” </p>



<p>I’m notoriously picky when it comes to foundation, but even I was blown away by how Armani’s Luminous Silk looked, and most importantly, felt on my skin. I was a true fan of the original Luminous Silk, but typically reserved it for special occasions that warranted a more glam look. As such, a natural, skincare-inspired version of Luminous Silk sounded right up my alley. </p>



<h2>What to know about Armani Luminous Silk Foundation:  </h2>



<p>– Available in 44 shades (including 18 brand-new ones to better suit a variety of undertones) <br />– Provides medium coverage with a glowy finish <br />– Includes skincare ingredients, including glycerin and niacinamide in a non-comedogenic formulation </p>



<h2>Is Armani’s new Luminous Silk Natural Glow Blurring Foundation good?  </h2>



<p>Like any liquid foundation, how you choose to apply it depends on the amount of coverage desired, as well as the finish you’re looking to achieve. However, one thing that immediately stood out to me during the testing process was how the new Luminous Silk truly disappeared into my skin, leaving behind a veil of coverage that looked like my skin, but better. Makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/cgonzalezbeauty/?hl=en"">Carolina Gonzalez</a> (who’s glammed celebrities like Sabrina Carpenter and Gigi Hadid) echoes this as one of Luminous Silk’s most notable upgrades. <s> </s>“The biggest standout for me is that it feels even more skin-like — it minimizes any texture on the skin, which I love, and gives a gorgeous soft-focus effect,” she says.  </p>



<p>My favorite way to apply foundation is to dot tiny amounts directly onto my face where I need the most coverage, and buff it out with a fluffy brush for an airbrushed effect that I can dial up if needed. And according to Gonzalez, the new Luminous Silk is more versatile than ever: “If I want a natural, soft-glam finish, I’ll use a foam wedge or my hands to really melt it into the skin,” she explains. “When I want more coverage, I typically use a brush and work it into the skin.”  </p>



<p>But no matter how you apply it, the consensus remains the same: “What I love most about this formula is that no matter how it’s applied or how many layers you build, you always get the same beautiful, skin-like result.” Beauty content creator Alexis Androulakis of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thelipsticklesbians/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Lipstick Lesbians</a> did a <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DTYLyD0EalN/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">side-by-side</a> comparison, touting the comfortable wear and less drying texture of the reformulation. However, she also noted that the two are more alike than different, especially in terms of the signature satin finish. </p>



<h2>Where can you get Armani Luminous Silk Foundation? </h2>



<p>The new-and-improved Armani Luminous Silk is currently available on <a href=""https://www.giorgioarmanibeauty-usa.com/makeup/face/foundation/luminous-silk-natural-glow-blurring-foundation/ww-01019-arm.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Armani Beauty’s website</a> and at select retailers including <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/luminous-silk-natural-glow-blurring-liquid-foundation-with-24-hour-wear-P519887"">Sephora</a> and <a href=""https://www.nordstrom.com/s/armani-beauty-luminous-silk-natural-glow-blurring-foundation-with-24-hour-wear/8688069"">Nordstrom</a> for $69 (a small increase from the previous price of $64).  </p>



<h2>Final Thoughts </h2>



<p>For the price, I was expecting to be blown away by the new Luminous Silk, and I have to admit that I vastly prefer it to the original. Luminous Silk Natural Glow has replaced my everyday foundation since I can sheer it out so easily, depending on how and how much I apply. (I also wore it recently to an event and my skin looked flawless for over seven hours, even with plenty of talking, eating, and drinking.)  </p>



<p>Is it a pricey product? Definitely — easily one of the most expensive in my collection. That said, it had impossibly large shoes to fill — not to mention a viciously loyal customer base willing to go to war — and I think it’s exceeded expectations. (The only piece of criticism I have is that I don’t get much of a blurring effect, which I love for minimizing the appearance of pores, texture, and acne scars. That said, I still like it overall as a foundation.) I can only wonder what we’ll be saying 25 years from now, when the 3.0 version hits our counters… </p>
<p><strong>Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?</strong></p>",
