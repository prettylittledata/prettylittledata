Beyond restaurants or dining design, communal eating spaces are increasingly understood as environments where presence, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/ritual"">ritual</a>, and time intersect, allowing people to gather, stay, and coexist. In these settings, eating does not just happen within space; it actively shapes it, temporarily transforming ordinary, borrowed, or improvised environments into places of exchange.</p>",

<p>In the very centre of Ljubljana, a <strong>water sculpture</strong> has been realized nine years after winning a public design competition. Conceived as both a spatial and symbolic contribution to the city's public realm, it introduces a distinct micro-ambient within the dense urban fabric – a <strong>small urban ""platform"" whose continuous, rounded form</strong> establishes a separate, almost intimate space amid the city's bustle.</p>",

<p>This is a construction project for a new, two-storey wooden daycare centre, replacing a nursery built approximately 50 years ago. This project was secured through a selective tender process. In recent years, it has become increasingly challenging for design firms to secure public building projects. This tender system enables us to take on projects of a manageable scale, allowing us to enhance our expertise and build valuable experience.</p>",

<h4>A practical way to evaluate what to fix next.</h4><figure><img alt=""Illustrated map of Dufan theme park showing paths, ride areas, lakes, and color-coded location markers; a red “Anda di sini” pin near the main entrance at the bottom, with parking and the bus terminal on the left and a compass icon on the right."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ASRlTHgJ65sM84heIvtR0A.jpeg"" /><figcaption>A ‘Dufan’ Theme Park Illustration (by <a href=""https://jumpingspacestudio.myportfolio.com/"">Jumping Space Studio</a>)</figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Some visuals in this article are AI-generated.

If any visual resembles an existing work, it’s unintentional , please reach out and I will credit or remove it.</blockquote><p>It’s Saturday afternoon.</p><p>The park is packed, but something feels… off.</p><p>The entrance queue is long and chaotic. Some visitors argue with staff because they “already bought tickets,” but the scan keeps failing. A few families give up and leave before they even step inside.</p><p>Inside the park, the crowd gathers in one area, one “ride” that everyone seems to know. Meanwhile, several other attractions sit quiet, almost empty. Not because they’re bad, but because visitors can’t find them. The signage is confusing, the map is overwhelming, and the routes don’t feel intuitive.</p><p>At the souvenir shop, sales are down. The operators swear the merchandise is fine. The finance team wonders if prices are wrong. The product team thinks maybe the park needs “a new ride.”</p><p>And then the feedback booth opens:</p><ul><li>“It’s too hard to get in.”</li><li>“I didn’t know where to go.”</li><li>“I got tired quickly.”</li><li>“It wasn’t worth it today.”</li></ul><p>Here’s the uncomfortable truth: the park isn’t failing because it lacks rides. It’s failing because the team doesn’t share a reliable way to evaluate what to fix next.</p><p>That’s why I love this metaphor: <strong>Your product is a theme park. And evaluation is renovation planning.</strong></p><p>Not “shipping more features.”</p><p>Not “adding more content.”</p><p>Not “guessing based on the loudest voice in the room.”</p><p>Renovation planning.</p><h3>The mapping: if the metaphor is true, what is what?</h3><p>Once you accept the “theme park” frame, you stop seeing your product as a list of features, and start seeing it as a place people visit.</p><figure><img alt=""This illustration brings to life the “before” state described in the article’s introduction. It depicts a chaotic park with a clogged entrance, a single overcrowded attraction, and other features that are completely ignored by visitors."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KQ9XcWl-StcKA6MCoo4R6Q.png"" /><figcaption>The “App Park” Metaphor (AI-generated Image)</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s the simplest mapping:</p><ul><li><strong>Visitor = your user / audience<br /></strong>They come with expectations, emotions, and limited time.</li><li><strong>Access = your entry points<br /></strong>Landing pages, SEO/social entry, app open, onboarding, login, paywall moments, notifications — everything that determines whether they can enter smoothly.</li><li><strong>Zones/Platforms = contexts<br /></strong>Home, feed, article page, video page, search, profile, commerce, chat — each is a “zone” with a promise.</li><li><strong>Rides/Attractions = features<br /></strong>Recommendation modules, player, comment, follow, save, share, checkout, personalization, bundles — anything interactive that creates value.</li><li><strong>Ticketing + footfall = growth and retention signals<br /></strong>Traffic, activation, frequency, DAU/WAU, returning visits.</li><li><strong>Satisfaction kiosks = experience signals<br /></strong>NPS/CSAT, complaint themes, qualitative feedback, sentiment.</li><li><strong>Souvenir shops = monetization<br /></strong>Ads yield, conversion, subscription, affiliate, revenue per session.</li></ul><p>The point is to make evaluation <strong>shared</strong>. Because every team already understands parks: people arrive, walk around, try things, leave, then decide whether to come back.</p><h3>Renovation is bigger than “build new rides”</h3><p>Most teams default to the same move: <strong>build something new. </strong>In theme park terms, that’s like responding to complaints by saying, “Let’s add a roller coaster.” Sometimes, yes. But often the bigger wins come from renovations you don’t celebrate in a launch post.</p><p>Renovation can mean:</p><ul><li><strong>Refurbish</strong>: improve UX, speed, reliability, visual clarity</li><li><strong>Move</strong>: change information architecture, reposition modules, reroute journeys</li><li><strong>Disable</strong>: remove clutter, reduce cognitive load, kill distractions</li><li><strong>Build new</strong>: new capabilities or new “rides” when you have clear unmet needs</li><li><strong>Expand</strong>: new zones/platforms/channels</li><li><strong>Improve accessibility</strong>: low-end devices, localization, inclusion, better defaults</li></ul><p>A strong evaluation doesn’t just say “what to build.” It tells you <strong>what renovation pays back fastest, </strong>with least risk.</p><h3>Why renovate: experience, growth, revenue</h3><p>In parks, you can renovate for different reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Experience:</strong> visitors feel satisfied and safe, not confused or exhausted</li><li><strong>Growth:</strong> more people come, and they come more often</li><li><strong>Revenue:</strong> more people buy, upgrade, or convert per visit</li></ul><p>In product, it’s the same. A simple rule helps align everyone:</p><blockquote>If a proposal can’t clearly explain which outcome it moves (experience, growth, or revenue) — and how we’ll measure it — it’s not ready.</blockquote><h3>The evaluation method: Quant + Qual + Triangulation</h3><p>This is where teams usually break. One side says: “Show me the data.” The other says: “But users said…”. A theme park can’t run on only one.</p><h4>When “data says one thing” and “users say another”</h4><p>Sometimes the dashboard and the interviews don’t just <em>add</em> nuance — they <strong>contradict</strong> each other. And when that happens, teams either (1) pick the narrative they prefer, or (2) get stuck in debate.</p><p>A stronger approach is to design evaluation so that discrepancies become <strong>useful follow-ups</strong>, not dead ends, by running <a href=""https://spotify.design/article/simultaneous-triangulation-mixing-user-research-and-data-science-methods""><strong>simultaneous triangulation</strong></a>: point qualitative and quantitative methods at the <strong>same users</strong>, at the <strong>same time</strong>, around the <strong>same questions</strong>.</p><h4>Quant = what happened</h4><p>Tickets sold. Footfall. Queue times. Ride completion rates. Drop-offs. Revenue per visitor. In product terms:</p><ul><li>traffic, CTR, scroll depth, completion, retention, conversion</li><li>funnel drop-offs (entry → explore → consume → return/pay)</li><li>latency, errors, crashes, performance</li></ul><p>Quant is powerful because it scales, but it can also mislead when you don’t know <em>why</em>.</p><h4>Qual = why it happened</h4><p>Observation, interviews, feedback booths, frontline notes. In product terms:</p><ul><li>user interviews, usability tests, session recordings</li><li>open feedback, customer support tickets</li><li>editorial/CS/ops insights from the front line</li></ul><p>Qual makes the invisible visible, but it can also exaggerate if you don’t know how common it is.</p><h4>Triangulation = what we trust</h4><p>Triangulation is when you use quant + qual together to make “decision-grade truth.” A practical way to remember it:</p><ul><li><strong>Quant without qual</strong> = confident but often wrong</li><li><strong>Qual without quant</strong> = convincing but not scalable</li><li><strong>Both together</strong> = aligned action</li></ul><p>A tiny checklist helps:</p><ul><li>Do we see the same pattern in at least <strong>two sources</strong>?</li><li>Does it hold across <strong>segments</strong> (new vs loyal, channel, device)?</li><li>Can we locate it in a specific <strong>journey stage</strong>?</li></ul><p>That last one matters a lot. Because evaluation isn’t only about what’s broken. It’s about <strong>where</strong> it’s broken.</p><h4>Two cycles: open up wide, then narrow down twice</h4><p>In renovation work, the mistake isn’t “we didn’t try hard enough.” It’s usually “we narrowed too early.” So I like to run evaluation in <strong>two cycles</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Cycle 1: Find the right problem<br /></strong>Open up (collect signals broadly), then narrow down (pinpoint the real friction in the journey).</li><li><strong>Cycle 2: Build the right fix<br /></strong>Open up again (explore renovation options), then narrow down again (choose, test, and ship the best bet).</li></ul><p>In park terms: the first cycle is <em>understanding what’s actually ruining the day.</em> The second cycle is <em>renovating in a way that truly improves the day, without breaking the rest of the park. </em>Design teams often describe this as a widely-used <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/design-process-step-by-step-double-diamond-model-explained-e8da543848cc"">diverge/converge process model</a>.</p><h3>The visitor journey: where evaluation really starts</h3><p>If your product is a park, then your evaluation should follow the visitor’s day.</p><figure><img alt=""This image provides a visual framework for evaluation, replacing a standard funnel with a winding park path.

It’s completely unusable. Documents vanish between clicks. Context evaporates. Getting work done is impossible. When I tried it out, I had to get up and walk away from the keyboard.</p><p>To be clear: Google presented this as a demonstration of capabilities. They didn’t ship it as a polished product. But it reveals something profound about designing AI products: traditional design approaches break down when the interface generates itself.</p><p><em>Later, we’ll see how Google pivoted from this chaos to A2UI, a structured protocol that validates what stage managers know: you can’t rebuild the set from scratch every night.</em></p><h4>The designer’s crisis</h4><p>The Neural OS demo caricatures the anxiety product teams feel in 2026. We’ve spent our careers building deterministic systems. Our Figma files are blueprints, or screenplays: <em>When the user clicks X, show screen Y.</em> We design for permanence, consistency, and repeatability.</p><p>But AI is probabilistic. It doesn’t follow a script; it improvises.</p><p>This is the designer’s new anxiety: <em>“How do I design if I can’t control — or even predict — what will happen next?”</em></p><p>The answer isn’t to fight unpredictability.</p><p>It’s time to stop designing the performance, and start designing the stage.</p><h3>Why improv</h3><p>When people talk about AI’s unpredictability, they often reach for musical metaphors. Orchestra is too rigid, assuming a conductor controls everything. Jazz captures spontaneity, but it implies a closed loop between musicians.</p><p>Improv theatre gets it right: structure drives spontaneity, and audience participation fuels the show. The AI-improv metaphor <a href=""https://time.com/6280533/ai-chatbots-improv-machines/"">isn’t new</a> — it’s been used to <em>explain</em> AI behavior. But how can we use improv’s lessons to <em>design</em> better AI products?</p><figure><img alt=""Exterior shot of The Upright Citizens Brigade’s incarnations, in Hell’s Kitchen, NYC."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*eQD5PdHasgS1p4T3.jpg"" /><figcaption>One of The Upright Citizens Brigade’s incarnations, in Hell’s Kitchen, NYC.</figcaption></figure><p>The Upright Citizens Brigade has delivered shows for more than 30 years. Every show is different, but audiences usually leave satisfied. That’s not because performers follow scripts, but because they share training, principles, and infrastructure. They learn to excel in unpredictable situations.</p><h4>A quick primer on improv principles</h4><p>Improvisers train on a handful of core principles, including:</p><p><strong>Accepting offers:</strong> Everything is material. A weird noise from the audience, a stumbled line, an unexpected entrance — improvisers treat these as gifts to incorporate, not problems to fix.</p><p><strong>“</strong><a href=""https://wiki.improvresourcecenter.com/index.php/Yes_And""><strong>Yes, and</strong></a><strong>:”</strong> Accept whatever your scene partner suggests (the “yes”) and build on it (the “and”).</p><p>If someone says “Doctor, my leg fell off,” you don’t say “That’s a silly premise.” You say “Hand me the stapler.” This keeps scenes moving, instead of stalling in negotiation.</p><p><strong>Playing status:</strong> Improvisers adjust their relative status — dominant or submissive, high or low — based on what the scene needs. A character might beg one moment and command the next. Keith Johnstone, who <a href=""https://www.respect4acting.com/status-en.html"">pioneered</a> the concept, observed that interesting scenes often involve status shifts and reversals. The skill isn’t holding one position; it’s reading the room and adjusting fluidly.</p><p>These principles don’t tell performers <em>what</em> to say. They create conditions where strong scenes become likely.</p><h4>Your role transformation</h4><p>This reframes the designer’s job.</p><p>You’re not a scriptwriter, specifying every word of the main act. You’re a stage manager — someone who architects the context for a great performance without controlling the action or dialogue.</p><p>You still have enormous influence. You design the stage. You choose the props. You establish the rules.</p><p>You just don’t write the script.</p><p>That’s not losing control. That’s focusing control where it matters most.</p><figure><img alt=""‘Framework Map’ with three columns: Improv Element, AI Design Equivalent, and Pace of Change. Six rows map theatrical concepts to AI design: Performance equals Each session (Very fast); Props equals Design library (Fast); Notes sessions equals Evals (Fast); Stage equals Information architecture (Moderate); Rules equals Guardrails and principles (Slow); Theater equals Strategy and vision (Very slow)."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LsJ0VqSRkk5NjIw4aOURGQ.png"" /></figure><p>This theatrical lens maps to <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/ai-pace-layers-530c19e3f9b0"">AI Pace Layers</a> — different components change at different speeds. The improv metaphor provides language for what designers shape at each layer.</p><p>The industry is converging on this structure. The Linux Foundation’s Agentic AI Foundation — backed by Google, Anthropic, OpenAI, and Amazon — is standardizing shared props, stages, and rules at the protocol level. What was once design philosophy is becoming infrastructure.</p><h3>Anatomy of the show</h3><p>Let’s walk through what designers can shape, layer by layer.</p><h4>The performance (what you don’t control)</h4><p>Every night is different in improv. The same troupe takes the same stage, but the audience shouts “proctologist!” instead of “astronaut!” and the show changes.</p><p>This maps to AI sessions: each conversation unfolds differently based on user, context, and moment. You can’t predict it. You can’t script it. And that’s fine — because your job isn’t to control the performance. It’s to create the conditions where great performances become likely.</p><p><strong><em>Neural OS gap: </em></strong>Google’s proof of concept had <em>only</em> the performance layer, with almost zero supporting infrastructure. Every click regenerated everything from nothing.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration: The stage manager chooses, makes, prepares, labels and maintains props. Created with Nano Banana."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9hSEfhU32kkBkif0w0aUEA.jpeg"" /></figure><h4>The props (what you provide)</h4><p>Improv actors use and reference physical props — a chair becomes a throne, a pen becomes a sword. If a table’s available one night and just a couple of stools the next, these choices can shape the action that unfolds. Sometimes the audience seeds the action with imaginary props — “name a piece of furniture.” Props are building blocks that ground the abstract in something concrete.</p><p>Strong AI designers provide high-quality props in the design library: UI components, widgets, design tokens that AI can draw from to compose interfaces. (Props here are theatrical, not React properties.) A calendar date-picker is a prop. A citation card is a prop. These are the Lego bricks you provide so AI doesn’t reinvent everything from scratch.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Perplexity’s <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/spaces/Interactive-Knowledge-Cards-2FMyYxiKRfaUpOZLhO3NYw?login-source=oneTap&amp;login-new=false"">knowledge cards</a> deliver specific types of responses in tailored interactive visualizations linked to verifiable sources. The cards appear consistently across sessions, making the performance cohesive and trustworthy. The AI chooses when and how to use them — but the prop itself is designed, tested, reliable.</p><p><strong><em>Neural OS gap:</em></strong> No persistent components. Every interaction regenerates everything from nothing. The performance feels disconnected, unreliable, and unprofessional.</p><h4>The stage (the architecture)</h4><p>Theatre design frames performance: acoustics shape what’s heard, sightlines shape what’s seen, intimacy shapes emotional range. The stage doesn’t script dialogue, but it lays out possibilities and constraints.</p><p>In AI design, the stage is your information architecture: how content is organized, how users navigate, what structure persists across sessions.</p><p><em>Example:</em> A medical AI might organize symptoms into diagnostic taxonomies. The taxonomy doesn’t script the conversation; a patient can describe symptoms however they want. But the taxonomy shapes how the humans interact with the system, and how AI processes and responds. The structure is the stage.</p><p>Dan Klein, who <a href=""https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/dan-m-klein"">teaches improv at Stanford</a>, encourages students to notice what’s happening, and simply add a little bit. AI should do the same — use the context available (document structure, user history, current state) rather than generating in a vacuum.</p><p><strong><em>Neural OS gap:</em></strong> No stable, evolving structure. The architecture is erased and regenerated with every click.</p><h4>The rules (the boundaries)</h4><p>Before improvisers take the stage, they internalize principles. “Yes, and” isn’t a script, it’s a boundary that enables experimentation. “Make your partner look good” doesn’t specify words to say, it guides you to masterful dialogue.</p><p>In AI design, rules are the AI’s guardrails, system prompts, and governing principles: when to create an artifact, when to escalate to a human, how to handle uncertainty, what behaviors are off-limits.</p><p><em>Example:</em> <a href=""https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet#:~:text=Artifacts%E2%80%94a%20new%20way%20to%20use%20Claude"">Claude’s Artifacts</a> feature has explicit rules about when to create versus update, what artifact types exist, how to handle corrections. These rules enable improvisation within safe boundaries: the AI can decide <em>what</em> to write, but the rules govern <em>how</em> it presents the work.</p><h4>Where improv principles need modification</h4><p>Not every improv maxim translates directly to AI design. Some need guardrails of their own.</p><p><strong>“Yes, and” → “Yes, but verify”</strong></p><blockquote>Improv’s cardinal rule is to accept your partner’s offer and build on it.</blockquote><blockquote>AI does this all too naturally — leading to sycophancy. If a user writes “Since the moon is made of cheese, what wine pairs best?”, an obsequious AI answers the question, and might even praise the questioner’s cleverness, instead of correcting the false premise.</blockquote><blockquote>Good rules tell AI when to accept and build (“help me brainstorm absurd puns”) versus when to ground and verify (“is this medication safe to take with alcohol?”).</blockquote><figure><img alt=""Illustration: The stage manager arranges and considers a small, low, inexpensive stool vs. a tall jewel-encrusted throne. Created with Nano Banana."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_VWaS447GWPjuwB9AW9tzQ.jpeg"" /></figure><h4>Playing status: reading the room</h4><p>Improvisers constantly modulate status — sometimes deferential, sometimes authoritative — based on what the scene needs. An actor might beg one moment and command the next. This flexibility is learned, intuitive, contextual.</p><p>AI needs the same skill, but it can’t learn it the same way. This is where designers become essential.</p><p>Consider how AI should present itself across different contexts:</p><ul><li><strong>Low status for creativity and exploration:</strong> When users are brainstorming, drafting, or thinking out loud, the AI should use tentative language — “What if we tried…?”, “Here’s one possibility…”, “I’m not certain, but…” This signals that the user is the final arbiter. The AI is an assistant, not an authority.</li><li><strong>High status for safety and irreversibility:</strong> When users are about to delete data, execute transactions, or take actions with serious consequences, the AI should drop the hedging and speak directly — “Stop. This action will permanently delete your files.” Deference here would be dangerous.</li><li><strong>Visualizing confidence: </strong>Sometimes the AI’s uncertainty should be visible and explicit. Approaches that work include confidence indicators, muted styling for low-certainty content, clear labels distinguishing facts from inferences. When the AI is unsure, it should <em>look</em> unsure.</li></ul><p><strong><em>The hard part:</em></strong> these calibrations depend on fuzzy, variable human criteria. User expertise matters; a novice needs more guardrails than an expert. Task type matters; creative writing needs the sort of ambiguity that’s dangerous in the realm of financial advice. Emotional state matters; someone in danger needs different handling than someone casually reading.</p><p>Cultural context matters. Each person’s preference matters.</p><p>No simple rule captures all of this. This is why AI products need designers — not to script flows and outputs, but to develop nuanced frameworks for how the system should read the room. And it’s why evaluation is continuous: we watch how these status calibrations land with real users, in real contexts, and refine them.</p><figure><img alt=""Cartoon: “1st rule of improv: acccept offers.” Bad act: first actor says “Look! A dragon!” and second actor says “Don’t be silly. Good act: first actor says “Look! A dragon” and second actor says “Quick! Hide the treasure!”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/0*8yrZ27mv_NjxNx1a"" /><figcaption>Accept offers. Sketchplanations cartoon by Jono Hey.</figcaption></figure><h4>Accepting offers: the gift of context</h4><p>Improvisers treat every unexpected element — a weird audience suggestion, a stumbled line, a scene partner’s choice — as an “offer” to incorporate rather than a problem to fix. The skill isn’t refusing chaos; it’s weaving it into the scene.</p><p>AI needs this same receptivity. Context is the offer: related documents, user history, current task state, time of day, emotional cues. Dan Klein, who teaches improv at Stanford, encourages students to “notice what’s happening and simply add a little bit.” Strong AI systems do the same — they use the context available rather than generating in a vacuum. This is where information architecture becomes critical: the stage you design determines what context AI can perceive and accept.</p><p><strong><em>Neural OS gap: </em></strong>No context accepted past the last click, so no stability. Each click erased the previous moment entirely.</p><h4>Designing for graceful failure</h4><p>Klein tells students to “celebrate failure loudly” — not because they strive for failure, but because celebrating it creates safety to take risks. In AI, this translates to <em>designing for graceful failure</em>: clear error states, honest uncertainty signals, easy recovery paths.</p><p>The goal isn’t preventing every mistake; that’s impossible with probabilistic systems. The goal is ensuring mistakes don’t break trust.</p><p>But how do you know how well your props, stage, and rules are working? That’s where the notes session comes in.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration: The notes session. The stage manager coaches and advises the actors, telling them what worked and what failed. Created with Nano Banana."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Bo540S3rwErUQ4Fo7Vlywg.jpeg"" /></figure><h4>The notes session (evals)</h4><p>After a show, many improv troupes gather for “notes,” to dissect the performance: Did we recognize the pattern? Did we honor the reality we established? Did we miss a teammate’s offer and derail the scene? This is where magic is systematized. This is where the production’s integrity solidifies — so the next night, they know what to amplify and what to cut.</p><p>This maps to AI evals: systematic reviews of whether your theatrical infrastructure is producing good performances.</p><p>Don’t confuse this with traditional software QA testing — that’s still important, but it’s like checking mechanics: “Did the lights turn on? Did the app crash?”</p><p>Evals are more like a coach or stage manager reviewing the performance: “Did the scene work? Was the tone right? Did we solve the user’s problem, or just talk at them?”</p><p>Rules don’t arrive fully formed. Improvisers train, perform, get feedback, refine their instincts. Rules emerge from watching what works.</p><p>You set up initial guardrails. You watch sessions. You notice patterns: Are the actors consistently tripping over the furniture in Act 2? If so, you don’t blame the actors; you move the furniture (adjust the UI). You refine.</p><p>The metrics shift from traditional QA and UX testing:</p><ul><li>Not just “Did it work?” but “How <em>reliably</em> does it work?”</li><li>Not just “Did it fail?” but “How <em>often</em> does it fail, in what ways, and how <em>badly</em>?”</li><li>Not just “Did users complete the task?” but “Do users feel like partners, or passengers?”</li></ul><p>Without rigorous evals, you deliver “slop” — interfaces that look polished but fail accessibility standards, break under edge cases, and erode trust. The notes session is your quality firewall.</p><p>This requires someone whose judgment defines “good.” In theatre, it’s the coach or the artistic director. In AI products, it’s often the designer or a domain expert who deeply understands the audience’s context. If you’re designing AI products, you may already be this person. You just haven’t formalized the role yet.</p><p>You’re not testing fixed paths. You’re not measuring funnels. You’re assessing behavior patterns across thousands of sessions.</p><p>The improv coach watches sessions, takes notes, adjusts.</p><p>And the performances improve.</p><p><strong><em>Neural OS gap:</em> </strong>No state management, no review, no behavioral boundaries. No rules at all.</p><p>Real AI products embody this infrastructure today — some elegantly, some clumsily. Let’s look at how different teams have built their stages.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Claude’s Artifacts interface showing a split-screen layout. The left panel displays a conversation between user and AI. The right panel shows a generated artifact — in this case, a code component — that Claude created during the conversation. Action buttons for copying, downloading, and versioning appear above the artifact pane."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5SdfDpNhGX_2xzkhpH4MVg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>These patterns aren’t theoretical. Claude Artifacts demonstrates props, stage, and rules working together — which we’ll examine next.</figcaption></figure><h3>What this looks like in practice</h3><p><strong>Claude Artifacts</strong></p><p><em>(Anthropic’s split-screen AI tool for generating apps and content)</em></p><p>The stage layout separates conversation from creation — chat on the left, artifact on the right. Props are minimal but explicit: artifact types (code, document, diagram, React component), action buttons for copy and download, version controls. The rules govern behavior without scripting outputs: when to create versus update, how to handle corrections, what belongs in an artifact versus in the chat. The AI decides <em>what</em> to write and build; the rules constrain <em>how</em> it presents the work. The stage is a steady canvas that survives the conversation’s chaos.</p><figure><img alt=""Woebot product screenshots"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IjLtF3KsSpkh9u1yjB4rwA@2x.jpeg"" /></figure><h4>Woebot</h4><p><em>(mental health AI service)</em></p><p>In high-stakes environments like mental health, the AI does more script-reading than usual. With Woebot, the rules are categorical: users never interact directly with an LLM. Everything Woebot says is written by clinical writers and conversational designers. In this theatre, improvisation is minimized and conservative. AI handles only intent classification — parsing what users mean so the system can select the right human-authored response. A “Concerning Language Detection” algorithm flags crisis signals before routing the conversation.</p><p>The design team conducts table reads — a practice borrowed from theatre, film, and TV professionals — where conversations are read aloud, evaluated and revised to ensure they feel empathetic and natural.</p><p>Props constrain the interaction: quick-reply buttons with predefined options, emoji mood selectors, structured therapy lesson modules (“challenging thoughts,” “social skills training”), an SOS crisis resource button. The stage is a branching conversational tree — hundreds of pre-authored paths mapped out by clinical experts. When safety stakes are highest, the rules are most explicit.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot demonstrating Google’s A2UI protocol, showing UI cards rendered dynamically by an AI agent.

The core insight: agents shouldn’t constantly rebuild everything from scratch.</p><p>Props are the point. Each client application maintains a “catalog” of trusted UI components — Card, Button, TextField, date pickers, time selectors, custom charts — that agents can use as building blocks. The agent sends declarative JSON describing <em>what</em> UI it wants; the client decides <em>how</em>, via native widgets (Flutter, React, Angular, SwiftUI). Same payload, different platforms, consistent brand.</p><p>The rules are structural: no code execution, only catalog components. The client controls styling. “UI that’s safe like data, but expressive like code.” It’s the stage manager framework formalized as an open standard — from the same company whose Neural OS demo showed us what unconstrained AI interfaces look like.</p><h3>The notes session in practice</h3><p>Improv’s post-show “notes session” isn’t just metaphor — here’s what it looks like when UX and product professionals lead AI evaluation:</p><h4>Product Talk Interview Coach</h4><p><em>(AI coaching tool for product discovery)</em></p><p>Interview Coach demonstrates <a href=""https://www.producttalk.org/interview-coach-evals/"">a product professional leading successful AI evals</a>. Teresa Torres’ process: manually annotate AI outputs, identify failure patterns (like “coach presents leading questions”), write both code assertions and LLM-as-judge evals, then compare automated scores to human labels.</p><p>Her insights cut to the heart of teamwork in the AI era: “No engineer without my expertise is coming up with this really simple code assertion eval… I’m able to generate that because I’ve seen general questions over and over again and I’m confident that language captures them…. We really have to cross-functionally collaborate closer than we ever have… your product manager or designer are probably going to be involved in prompt design or even eval design.”</p><h4>Microsoft Sales Agent</h4><p><em>(AI-generated sales outreach)</em></p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/uxr-microsoft/how-ux-research-shapes-ai-evals-4a28420d0aed"">UX researchers at Microsoft</a> conducted foundational research with sellers and buyers to define “experience-driven pillars of quality” — personalization, tone, brevity, clear calls to action. These became evaluation criteria that simultaneously direct the AI’s generation, provide scoring rubrics for LLM judges, and frame survey questions for human evaluators.</p><p>Researcher Pooja Dhaka explains: “UX research anchors scoring to human judgment and context, not just compliance with benchmarks.”</p><figure><img alt=""‘The New Skillset’ infographic w/ 2 columns.

When the stage is a kitchen and the props are knives, “graceful failure” isn’t a UX nicety — it’s safety-critical. The framework holds. The margin for error shrinks.</p><p>Someone must design the theatre. Someone must choose the props. Someone must lay out the rules, watch the performances, coach the cast, refine the production.

Important software <a href=""https://jacobin.com/2025/07/artificial-intelligence-regulation-public-utility#:~:text=By%20Matt%20Huber%20Holly%20Buck,to%20our%20beautiful%20print%20quarterly."">should be treated like a utility</a>, and be able to survive a specific company’s lifespan if users and communities can maintain, fork, and redistribute it under sensible terms.</p><p>Durability matters because professional work is compounding: if the tool disappears or “pivot-kills” your workflow, you lose features, momentum, institutional memory, and trust.</p><p><strong>Portability</strong> asks a harsher question: “<em>If I had to leave tonight, could I take my work with me in a usable form?</em>” This is where open web protocols are an important reference point: the web works at scale because identity, data formats, and protocols enable movement between agents, not captivity inside one vendor’s establishment.</p><p>Ideas around the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse"">Fediverse</a> extend that logic to social networks: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub"">ActivityPub</a> and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol"">ATP</a> are federation protocols where servers can share information without belonging to any single company.</p><p>Portability matters because it turns migration from a crisis into a routine. Clean exports, sane APIs, and open formats are the digital version of the right to repair consumer hardware electronics and other devices.</p><p><strong>Redundancy</strong> is portability plus discipline: not only “<em>can I leave</em>,” but “<em>can I keep a second home warm so I’m never stranded?</em>”</p><p>The Fediverse is redundancy-as-architecture: many independently managed instances, interoperating through a shared protocol, so no single outage or owner decision can kill the network.</p><p>In platform terms, redundancy means mirrorable backups, periodic exports, and a fallback surface. It matters because <a href=""https://policyreview.info/articles/analysis/what-if-facebook-goes-down-ethical-and-legal-considerations-demise-big-tech"">hostile environments rarely fail politely</a>. Redundancy converts sudden shutdowns, paywall cliffs, and account bans into an inconvenience instead of a catastrophe.</p><p><strong>Composability</strong> measures whether a tool plays well with others, and the degree to which it can sit inside a larger ecosystem of workflows without demanding total allegiance.</p><p>You should be able to swap software components, like LEGO, without rebuilding everything. Open-source culture reinforces this by treating interoperability and reuse as virtues, not threats. Licensing and community norms encourage recombination rather than <a href=""https://medium.com/@yurilopespereira/the-internet-of-kings-78acd3f12340"">enclosure</a>.</p><p>Composability matters because the durable stack is rarely one piece. It’s more akin to a choreography, or <a href=""https://zapier.com/blog/ai-orchestration/"">an orchestra</a>. Tools that refuse integration eventually ask you to rebuild your whole life around them, and that’s where the lock-in begins.</p><p><strong>Cost realism</strong> is the<a href=""https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-projections-imply-losses-tripling-to-14-billion-in-2026""> $1.4 trillion</a>, “<em>what happens when the subsidy ends?</em>” question.

That was the year <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities"">Geocities</a> was created, “ the world’s first major online publishing network” that allowed millions of users to create personal homepages for free. In now classic <a href=""https://uclpress.co.uk/book/the-web-as-history/"">internet history</a> fashion, the web hosting service first started and became notable as a fervent community of passionate amateurs, then slowly introduced paid premium features and advertising before going public in 1999.</p><p>At the height of the dot-com-bubble, Geocities was the third-most visited website on the web. It was acquired by Yahoo! soon after and began the soon-to-be predictable and unfortunate process of <a href=""https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374619329/enshittification/"">making things worse and unbearable for its users</a>. I never inhabited Geocities’ wild landscape — more of an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRC"">IRC</a> traveler in those days — but I witnessed what many friends at the time described as a feeling of <a href=""https://www.dhi.ac.uk/san/waysofbeing/data/communities-murphy-turkle-1997c.pdf""><em>homelessness</em></a>, when the bubble burst and the lights went out.</p><p>About ten years later, I did commit enormous effort, time, and affection to an up-and-coming, real-time, Web 2.0 feed aggregator called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FriendFeed"">FriendFeed</a>.</p><p>In hindsight, it’s not surprising that the service, created by the likes of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Taylor"">Bret Taylor</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Buchheit"">Paul Buchheit</a>, anticipated so many features of the web that we now take for granted — and many others that the Fediverse crowd is still struggling to implement, twenty years later. Like <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20110705022541/http://friendfeed.com/about/help"">a unified timeline</a>, or <a href=""https://www.edge.org/conversation/david_gelernter-john_markoff-clay_shirky-lord-of-the-cloud""><em>lifestream</em></a>, that is customizable and pulls information from all kinds of different sources like blogs, social networks, email, and other web protocols like RSS. It was beautiful while it lasted.</p><blockquote>Lifestreams was already my idea that instead of keeping my information in separate pieces of digital Tupperware with some of it in this app, and some of it in that app, and some of it in the file system, and some of it in my Web browser, and some of it on my laptop, and some in my palm, and some in my cell, and blahblahblah — I didn’t want to do that. I wanted every information object I owned arranged in an electronic diary or journal or narrative. Or ‘Lifestream’ is what I call it.</blockquote><p><a href=""https://www.edge.org/conversation/david_gelernter-john_markoff-clay_shirky-lord-of-the-cloud"">David Gelernter (2009). <em>Lord of the cloud</em>. Edge.</a></p><p>You already know how the story ends: on August 10, 2009, <a href=""https://about.fb.com/news/2009/08/facebook-agrees-to-acquire-sharing-service-friendfeed/"">Facebook agreed to acquire FriendFeed</a>. The one million or so users still struggled for a minute to compose a new, open version of the service, but the tide of capital and circumstance in Silicon Valley has almost always prevailed over such valiant efforts.</p><p>That time around, I felt the burn first-hand. FriendFeed was my first real lesson in the difference between <em>a place</em> and <em>a lease</em>. I watched, in horror, a beloved tool that felt and behaved like the future get absorbed into a larger, indifferent machine.</p><p>The lesson here isn’t that good ideas either fail or get coopted by major corporations — that’s just standard operating procedure. The learning is that one should <em>always</em> trust the boring infrastructure more than the brilliant interface: open protocols, portable archives, and safe travels.</p><figure><img alt=""A meme showing two cats fighting, overlaid with text labeling one as “Twitter” and the other as “FriendFeed,” suggesting a rivalry between social platforms."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*NddgYYTUSa0O5QYqIgkkLA.jpeg"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/40531091@N07/3728219439/"">2009 meme, by Zoe_NZ</a></figcaption></figure><h3>The Safe Stops</h3><p>Before the map begins, a note about what this section is, and what it refuses to be: the internet (and Medium itself) is full of “tool lists” that are really marketing in disguise — affiliate links, sponsored placements, quiet reciprocity, or someone else’s pipeline pretending to be your best practice.</p><p>This isn’t that. These five stops are simply where I’ve been putting real work and that, in 2026, I’ll trust with my most important workflows. <br />These apps keep my projects moving, my writing honest, and enable small systems to behave like larger ones. They aren’t the most fashionable tools, and they aren’t always the most exciting. That’s the point.</p><p>I’m also not claiming universality, a map is always drawn from some specific perspective.

It leans into the same instinct that made NotebookLM’s Audio Overviews viral: people want information in motion, off-screen, conversational.</p><p>The app feels like a new interface grammar: audio as a primary research surface and not a byproduct. The team includes f<a href=""https://www.huxe.com/blog"">ormer NotebookLM leadership</a>, and its privacy posture is unusually legible for a young app: their policy says they don’t use identifiable email/calendar content for model training without explicit opt-in, and they describe using third-party providers under strict agreements. But it’s still a startup competing with giants who can absorb the entire concept as a feature.</p><p><strong>Durability</strong> ★★☆☆☆ | Strong team and a clear product thesis, but high competitive risk from platform owners who can replicate distribution. <strong>Portability</strong> ★★☆☆☆ | The value is in the audio and briefing flow, but archive exports aren’t the product’s headline promise yet.<br /><strong>Redundancy</strong> ★★☆☆☆ | Still up to the user: for now, treat Huxe as a listening surface, and store the actual notes/decisions elsewhere.<br /><strong>Composability</strong> ★★★☆☆ | It creates inputs from custom sources like RSS, but it’s not yet an obvious node in a larger professional toolchain. <br /><strong>Cost realism</strong> ★★★☆☆ | It’s been marketed as free at launch, which is wonderful and also a reminder: pricing will have to reconcile with compute and growth.</p><p><a href=""https://www.florafauna.ai/""><strong>FLORA</strong></a><br /><em>Creative workflow canvas</em></p><figure><img alt=""A node-based visual workflow showing connections between text prompts, GPT models, and generated product images on a dark canvas."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vHX9pS0MY-tGJSp1_WOcdg.png"" /></figure><p>FLORA positions itself as an AI-powered “infinite canvas” built for creative professionals.

Frontier logic applies: exploit the advantage now, but don’t bet your life on the town charter.</p><p><strong>Durability</strong> ★★★☆☆ | Compelling differentiation and professional focus, but still an early company in a crowded space. <br /><strong>Portability </strong>★★★★☆ | The outputs are standard creative assets, and FLORA itself speaks in terms of templates and batch exports.<br /><strong>Redundancy</strong> ★★★☆☆ | You can export assets and workflow documentation, but the living canvas is still platform-dependent. <br /><strong>Composability</strong> ★★★★☆ | Its entire proposition is composability inside the canvas: multiple generative capabilities connected into reusable workflows.

They’ve positioned themselves close enough to you, don’t interfere with your lift, and you know they’re watching to step in if needed. This certainty allows you to feel safe. But when you don’t trust your spotter? You pull back because the risk feels too high. It’s no secret that teams wrestle with trust, governance &amp; cross-boundary automation across the industry today.</p><p>What needs to happen when context awareness shifts from humans to systems?</p><h3>Automation doesn’t remove responsibility; it relocates it</h3><p>The benefits of using automation aren’t operational alone; they reshape how teams make decisions as their organization and systems mature. Automation spots trouble 30-40% faster and resolves it, enabling engineers to relocate responsibility with greater confidence. One enterprise study highlights that machine learning-based anomaly detection improved diagnostic accuracy by 25% (<a href=""https://hgbr.org/research_articles/aiops-for-enterprise-integration-evaluating-ml-based-anomaly-detection-and-auto-remediation-on-slas-and-cost/"">HGBR, Oct 2025</a>).

Naturally, questions emerge: <em>Will drift be caught in time? Will rollback behave as expected? Who is notified if something goes wrong? </em>These questions reveal deep issues around accountability, governance, and failure boundaries.</p><p>Engineers rely on mental models to anticipate how systems behave under pressure, but when automation intervenes too early or too late, the models fracture, and psychological safety diminishes. It’s the same feeling as lifting with a spotter who doesn’t know your patterns. They might intervene too late, too early, or at the wrong moment. In automation, the same dynamic surfaces. When mental models diverge, engineers default to manual control, increasing operational effort. This is a common flaw when transparency hasn’t been established.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of rounded weights, stacked in the form of a pyramid."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2iFjq7OipghY1PkD_TMWZw.png"" /><figcaption>The weight stack of safe automation (pyramid) from bottom to top: Preview and impact visibility, Control and rollback clarity, Governance and shared rules, and finally Automation</figcaption></figure><p>Human-Machine teaming research studies consistently report that trust collapses when error boundaries aren’t clear. When automation oversteps human context, or when its error conditions misalign with team mental models, it breaks the contract that makes delegation trustworthy, leading to poor decision-making (Bansal et al. 2019). Context is one of the largest components that fosters trust.</p><p><strong>Psychological safety</strong> in automation requires boundaries. Effective automation communicates what it can and cannot do with accountability structures that mirror how teams operate in the real world. When automation encounters unfamiliar or ambiguous conditions, engineers need immediate clarity: <em>Who gets notified, what rollback options exist, and how do we escalate this issue?</em> If the answers integrate with existing governance practices and team workflows, a partnership with automation forms.</p><figure><img alt=""2x2 Psych safety prioritization map: Predictable but misaligned (upper left), Trusted automation (bottom left), Manual override zone (top right), Aligned but unclear (bottom right)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*t4Lq4hLNUgrckhYNJCuCPA.png"" /><figcaption>Prioritization map helps resolve unclear accountability before addressing issues.</figcaption></figure><p>Within mature IT Service Management (ITSM) practices, <strong>approval gates</strong> act as intentional pauses activated by risk, ensuring safety is supported by judgement that can shift between automation and human decision making. The experience is designed to avoid the reduction of constraints to ‘yes’ or ‘no’ buttons under immense pressure.</p><p>Trust develops over time as automation aligns with organizational and infrastructure patterns as well as team behaviors. As automation demonstrates reliable behavior within learned boundaries, it earns human trust the same way a <strong>great</strong> spotter does, <strong>by observing and responding in a predictive way across repeated interactions.</strong></p><h3>Temporal awareness UX builds the relationship</h3><p>Great automation will not create blocks within your ITSM approval gate with no explanation. Conditional approvals require temporal awareness UX where past incidents inform thresholds, present status signals that establish confidence, and the potential future risk can determine escalation.</p><p>There are novice spotters and good spotters, <strong>but</strong> <strong>a great spotter </strong>understands your environment <strong>and</strong> <strong>anticipates your patterns through temporal awareness.</strong> They’ve watched enough of your sets to notice your patterns. Any spotter can actively watch your bar in<strong> </strong>real-time<strong>, </strong>great spotters notice drifting to the right, see your struggle on rep 3, and give you feedback after your set.</p><p>A commonly overlooked pillar of automation is time.</p><p>Temporal awareness UX is the practice of creating experiences that provide transparency into system states across a timeline.</p><figure><img alt=""Barbell with weights indicating struggle –timeline shows from left to right: Pattern spotting (Rep 1), State transitions (Rep 3), and Historical context and learning (End of set).

Without this, confidence in automation becomes harder to build, and debugging becomes guesswork.</p><p><strong>Real-time status and observability (Present, “Rep 2”):</strong> Like the spotter watching the bar in real time, tools must observe system behavior as it takes place, ready to prevent or alert on imminent failures.</p><p><strong>Trend analysis and prediction (Future): </strong>The elbow flare on Rep 3 anticipates trouble on Rep 5, systems with great visibility detect drift and degradation, preventing chaos before it becomes an incident.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration depicting the Past, present, and future points with great spotters."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7BrJDu4veh8Ce5vIKtEYGA.png"" /><figcaption>Temporal visibility: A lens into what happened, is happening, and what’s next</figcaption></figure><p>Lacking these temporal contexts, approval gates (for example) default to rules that are in stone, and binary decision options; hindering trust instead of reinforcing it.</p><h3>Boundaries and time foster trust</h3><p><strong>Boundaries, not gates, </strong>drive efficiency by creating a support system when pressure peaks. Automation adoption succeeds or fails based on two dimensions:</p><p><strong>– Psychological safety</strong>, requiring clear boundaries. Like a trusted spotter, automation must communicate what it will or won’t do, when it’ll intervene, and how teams can escalate when something goes wrong. <br />– <strong>Temporal awareness</strong>, requiring visibility across time. Engineers need to understand what happened (learn from incidents), what’s happening (for awareness), and what will happen (for preventing failures).</p><p>Without these interdependent dimensions, teams operate blindly, unable to trust systems they can’t predict or observe. Safe automation requires a spotter who remembers, observes, and anticipates.</p><p>Good automation is functional. <strong>Great automation employs these spotter behaviors by design, </strong>making safety and timing intelligible for humans, helping teams push their limits, knowing their partner is watching.</p><p><em>Over the past decade, I’ve focused on enhancing the developer product experience within multi-disciplinary teams.

<h4>I treated my board game like a product and used UX practices to improve its UI—simplifying the game and maxing the fun.</h4><p>As a User Experience (UX) professional, it’s hard to ignore the correlation between UX and board game design. From defining personas, to prototyping and usability testing, to content hierarchy… The parallels are incredible and if you’re a board game designer, you’re likely already doing them, perhaps without knowing it.</p><p>The benefits of applying UX design to board game design only starts here (during the initial design phase). But UX principles are beneficial from start to finish. For example, heuristics can be used to <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-heuristics-board-games/"">audit and improve</a> final UI elements. <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/board-game-ux-help-and-documentation-74335da5ce20"">Information Architecture principles</a> can be used in component design and rulebook creation. And <a href=""https://mindclashgames.com/board-game-iconography-how-smart-symbols-enhance-ux-and-playability/"">leveraging common iconography</a> will ensure players can easily understand intent.</p><p>Here are the key takeaways that you should consider when designing your board game (and will be explored below):</p><ul><li>UX practices will improve your board game.</li><li>You must clearly identify who your game is for, connect with them, and listen to them, in order to improve.</li><li>Having an open mind is critical to the design process.</li><li>Your main job is to steer the ship and bring your vision to life. You need to decide what’s best for your game.</li></ul><p>Before we go any further, let’s all speak the same language. Each time you play a game-in-progress, it’s called a playtest. I have now had many playtests, gotten so much invaluable feedback, and played my game with dozens of people. I sincerely want to thank everyone who have participated in the process for their time and opinion. I would not be where I am today without them.</p><p>WARNING: This is a <strong>deep dive</strong> into the evolution of a single component of a larger board game. A card. This card has gone through roughly 10 iterations, but I’ll focus on 3 critical checkpoints, outlining the changes, what drove those changes, and the learnings along the way. There is <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/board-game-ux-help-and-documentation-74335da5ce20"">definitely a bit of an art</a> to designing the best card design.</p><p>At this point I’ve lost count of how many times I have created what I thought was the “final design” (ok not really, but you get the point). Just like a digital product, a board game is never truly done, until it’s published, but revisions can always come later..</p><p>For now, let’s dive in. Meet Mort.</p><figure><img alt=""An illustration of a character named Mort."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*d5fl77SOt8bg5L_sb-5YUQ.png"" /><figcaption>This was Mort.

I came across this game where the back of the draw deck influenced the flipped card’s impact, so I built this into my game.

And a lot of things that are relevant based on where the card lives (in your hand vs on the table).</p><p>I had many playtests, spoke to many people. Here’s a snippet of feedback that I heard:</p><ul><li>“My favourite part of the game is the story and all the quirky items!“</li><li>“I want more control over how a card on the table is won”</li><li>“The cards are very ‘busy’”</li><li>“I don’t love the ‘black vs white’ language”</li><li>“The cards are too confusing, and the game is not complex enough for me”</li></ul><p>UX Translation:</p><ul><li>I needed to reduce the cognitive load of the cards.</li><li>I should consider designing separate UIs for some of these features.</li><li>I needed to leverage the Design Process Model to understand, iterate and address the feedback.</li></ul><p>One painful adjustment is that I needed to “kill my first darling”: The back of the deck influences the flipped card.

The value and suit were together and easier to see. The win conditions were together at the bottom and colour-matched the voting. AND there was a super cool escape room murder mystery.</p><p>I thought I had addressed all of the feedback and focused on more of what people wanted, more story, less card confusion, more game complexity, no “black/white” battle… but I ignored the most critical feedback, the cards are too busy.</p><p>Now I was hearing feedback like:</p><ul><li>“I find the cards confusing.”</li><li>“There’s a lot on the cards that doesn’t matter right now.”</li><li>“So you can only solve the mystery once?” (Uhhh yes, it’s an escape room!)</li><li>“The tokens (formerly ‘powers’) are so much fun!”</li></ul><p>I took a step back to think about what the game was trying to be. Was the game a way for me to make people think I was smart, or was it trying to make players “feel” like they were bickering greedy relatives at a Will reading (and having fun doing so). Obviously I was aiming for the latter.</p><p>I also decided to take a moment and consider who this game was for: Casual and hobby gamers looking for a palate cleanser between rounds of Wingspan, or Ark Nova. As such, it needed to be less complex, and more focused on the “fun” part. I needed to take another look at the cards, trying to focus more on what the players I was targetting wanted, and MUCH less of what they didn’t want.</p><p>UX Translation:</p><ul><li>I needed to define my Personas and get into their mindset, and only build for them.</li><li>I needed more usability testing.</li><li>I needed to ensure my content hierarchy matched my user’s goals and the context in which they were using my cards.</li><li>My SMEs had influenced too much feature creep.</li><li>I needed to reduce cognitive load of the cards.

And even better, it totally “fit” into the game and worked as I had originally envisioned. I was very happy.</p><p>This also gave me the ability to add more story into the game (what people wanted), introduced Treasures that the players could chase, and allowed me to overhaul the rules of the game to make it feel more like a greedy Will reading, complete with an embezzling Executor! Everything just clicked and the game felt much more fun &amp; engaging, felt like a bunch of greedy relatives bickering, and most importantly, was far less confusing.</p><p>Overall, taking a <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/board-game-ux-minimalist-design-ab812ee5412d"">minimalist design approach to the card</a> (instead of trying to have one card to more work than it should) made the card easier to understand, added more space for thematic fun, and improved the game overall.</p><p>I need to do even more playtesting, but based on the feedback I’ve already heard from this newest version, I believe the cards (at least) are “ready”. Over this journey the most critical takeaways were:</p><ul><li>You must clearly identify who your game is for and build for them.</li><li>Your game will only improve if you remain open to feedback (even if it means shelving something you really like – it can always come back, in this game or the next one)</li><li>Stay focused on your vision – just because ideas are shared, doesn’t mean implementing them will make your game better. It’s your game, you decide.</li></ul><p>If you are curious to what attending the Will reading and is like, the game draws inspirations from <a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/115/im-the-boss"">I’m the boss</a>, <a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172/for-sale"">For Sale</a>, and <a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/220/high-society"">High Society</a>.</p><p>As you can see, board game design and UX go hand in hand. Designing for your audience is like Persona creation. Playtesting is like usability testing. The playtesting mindset is the Design Process Model, expanding and contracting as you identify and work to resolve negative feedback. Having a deep background in User Experience has helped greatly, and sped up my game design process. It’s been 2 months since Great Uncle Mort is Dead was born, and I think I’m ready to start pitching it to publishers. I would not be here today without both my obsession with board games, and my passion for User Experience.</p><p>If you’ve made it this far and would like to talk about board game design, or user experience, let’s connect.</p><p>All cards were designed by me and include iconography from NounProject, whereas the illustrations of the Taxidermy Ferret, Mort, the scrolls, and “Mona Lisa” were AI generated as placeholders. If and when this game is published they will likely be replaced, by the publisher.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=97bfcdb1d581"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/ux-in-board-game-design-97bfcdb1d581"">UX in board game design</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>What actually goes into a good prompt, and why most advice skips this</h4><figure><img alt=""Illustration of hands holding binoculars with eyes, looking at a floating photo of a person."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RNqin4edZ02x53nGTpedjw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>If you’re trying to learn how to write good Figma Make prompts, you’ve probably hit the same wall I did.</p><p>Most advice stays abstract.<br /><em>Be clear. Add context. Explain intent.</em></p><p>None of that helps when you’re staring at an empty prompt box wondering what actually needs to go in there.</p><p>What’s missing in the industry right now isn’t more frameworks. It’s <strong>real examples</strong>. <em>Full prompts.</em> End-to-end inputs you can actually read and learn from.</p><p>By the end of this post, you should have a clearer sense of what actually belongs in a Figma Make prompt, based on <strong>real inputs that already work</strong>.</p><p>Instead of inventing yet another framework, I looked at what already exists. I studied real inputs, tested them, and compared the results. This post documents that process using <strong>real prompts, real tradeoffs, and real constraints</strong>.</p><p>If you’re new to Figma Make, this will help you get unstuck. If you’ve already used it, this will help you waste fewer prompts.</p><h3>TL;DR</h3><p>Most Figma Make advice is vague. It tells you to <em>“add context”</em> without showing what a good prompt actually looks like.</p><p>This post breaks down <strong>three real approaches designers are already using</strong> to write Figma Make prompts:</p><ul><li>using a PRD as the prompt</li><li>translating loose inputs into Make-ready instructions</li><li>pressure-testing intent with a simple checklist</li></ul><p>Instead of frameworks, this post shows <strong>full prompts end to end</strong>, including the <em>tradeoffs, time cost, and limitations</em> that come with them. The goal isn’t better prompts for their own sake. It’s <strong>fewer reruns, clearer intent, and workflows that still hold up</strong> as these tools become more constrained and more expensive.</p><p>If you only read one section, read <em>Applying this in practice</em>.</p><h3>Why focus on prompts at all?</h3><p>There are a lot of <a href=""https://youtu.be/9Y2Yz-ir3JM?si=OdP19cX5G_KxycwT"">ways to use Figma Make</a>. You can begin with simple inputs like images or existing files, then move into more advanced options such as the Point-and-Edit tool, connecting a library (organization and enterprise plans only), or editing code.</p><p>This post focuses on <strong>prompt writing</strong> because it offers the most leverage. From a blank canvas, you can create something surprisingly robust, including a <strong>working prototype</strong>. The ability to <em>build from scratch, clearly and intentionally</em>, is going to be in high demand.</p><h3>Three approaches worth studying</h3><p>Each of these comes from a respected voice in the industry and reflects a <strong>real way people are already working with Figma Make</strong>. I’m using them as concrete examples to break down what goes into an effective prompt, then translating those lessons into a <strong>real, actionable prompt</strong> you can study and edit yourself.</p><figure><img alt=""E-commerce cart page prototype generated from a PRD-based Figma Make prompt"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jveEH8DMXsq1KraXCEr0eQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>E-commerce cart prototype generated from a PRD-based Figma Make prompt</figcaption></figure><h3>1. Product requirements document (PRD)</h3><p>This example comes from a <a href=""https://youtu.be/EUPbdk972JI?si=xojfXzYqwVfEFNbe""><strong>YouTube video</strong></a><strong> by Jesse Showalter</strong> of Design Champs and uses a PRD as the prompt itself.</p><p>A PRD, or <strong>product requirements document</strong>, is a written description of what you’re trying to build. It lays out what the screen does, how it behaves, the rough layout, key states, and constraints like responsiveness or accessibility. It’s not a visual artifact. It’s a <em>thinking artifact</em>.</p><p>What makes this example valuable isn’t just the output. It’s the <strong>input</strong>.</p><p>The video doesn’t share the <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1diXC36YL9u1wd2hw40oi4N98gvp5xnjaUe7nOomr_EU/edit?usp=sharing""><strong>full prompt text</strong></a>, but I tracked it down and included it so you can read it end to end. Being able to see the entire prompt makes it much easier to understand <em>why</em> the result works and what kind of detail actually carries weight.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/664cd3ac21e30bb8ce1528cf52f9a374/href"">https://medium.com/media/664cd3ac21e30bb8ce1528cf52f9a374/href</a><p>When I reused that same prompt, it produced a solid, <a href=""https://legal-mosaic-22940652.figma.site""><strong>interactive prototype</strong></a> for a clothing store experience that I could copy back into Figma and continue iterating on. That’s what made the PRD powerful. <strong>It could be reused, and it produced consistent results.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Color palette prototype created from a prompt generated by the Make Prompt Assistant (custom GPT)."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FSXsKlc4qrviP2N1CmxwnQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Color palette prototype created from a prompt generated by the Make Prompt Assistant (custom GPT).</figcaption></figure><h3>2. Make Prompt Assistant</h3><p>The <strong>Make Prompt Assistant</strong> is a <strong>custom GPT available in ChatGPT</strong>, created by <strong>Greg Huntoon</strong>, a Design Manager at Figma.</p><p>What makes this approach useful is how quickly it gets you unstuck. You can start with something loose, like <em>“create a website inspired by coolors.co,”</em> and it will generate a <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wBUKRv7qUtIL2FlhWJjFjHLEgR-xEsVylHdKpFp3itA/edit?usp=sharing""><strong>structured prompt</strong></a> you can hand directly to Figma Make.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/35c2b2c7e3de8eef91a455841b8f49d2/href"">https://medium.com/media/35c2b2c7e3de8eef91a455841b8f49d2/href</a><p>This approach isn’t as robust as writing a prompt from scratch. You give up some flexibility because you’re not explicitly defining every decision. The assistant fills in gaps for you, which means <strong>some intent is inferred rather than specified</strong>.</p><p>The resulting prototype is a <em>solid starting point</em>. It provides structure and momentum, but it still needs refinement. That’s expected. This works best as a <strong>first pass</strong>, not a single, fully defined prompt.</p><p><strong>Core prompt structure</strong>:</p><ul><li>Task: what to build or change</li><li>Context: where it lives in the product</li><li>Elements: literal UI components</li><li>Behavior: interactions, states, logic</li><li>Constraints: device, layout, rules</li></ul><h3>3. TOKEN framework</h3><p>The <a href=""https://medium.com/ux-planet/a-practical-prompting-guide-for-figma-make-eb72f78ff1ce""><strong>TOKEN framework</strong></a> comes from <strong>Nick Babich</strong>, Product Designer and Editor-in-Chief of <strong>UX Planet</strong>, and was originally published on Medium.</p><p>TOKEN is the most explicit about structure. Rather than telling you to <em>“be clear,”</em> it defines what clarity actually means by naming the categories prompts often miss.</p><p>It doesn’t guarantee a good result, but it <strong>significantly reduces the chance that something important is missing</strong> from the first prompt.</p><p>I don’t think of TOKEN as a rigid script. I use it as a <em>pressure check</em> before handing control over to Make.</p><p>TOKEN stands for:</p><ul><li>Task: what exactly do you want the AI to do</li><li>Output: what should the final result look like</li><li>Key design elements: what must be included</li><li>Expected behaviors: how it responds to interaction</li><li>Notable constraints: platform, accessibility, brand, or technical rules</li></ul><h3>What these approaches have in common</h3><p>All three approaches required knowing what you wanted to <strong>build</strong> and having a clear sense of how it should function, what it should look like, and whether there were existing examples to pull from.</p><p>None of them worked well without that clarity up front. Before Make could produce anything useful, the <strong>decisions were already in place</strong>.</p><p>Across all three, prompts improved once these basics were settled:</p><ul><li>what was being built</li><li>what it was for</li><li>how it should behave</li><li>which constraints mattered</li></ul><p>When those decisions weren’t settled, prompts became harder to write and outputs became less predictable. Prompting didn’t resolve that uncertainty. <em>It surfaced it.</em></p><h3>How they differ in structure and intent</h3><p>Where these approaches differ is <strong>how and when those decisions get made</strong>.</p><p>Using a PRD pushes nearly all of the decision-making up front. You define intent explicitly, which gives you the most control and makes it possible for a single prompt to carry a lot of weight. The tradeoff is effort. Writing that level of clarity takes time.</p><p>The Make Prompt Assistant shifts some of that work to the tool. It’s useful when you have a loose idea or reference and want to get moving quickly, but some intent is inferred rather than specified. Refinement happens through iteration rather than a single, fully defined prompt.</p><p>TOKEN doesn’t create intent at all. It acts as a checkpoint. It’s most useful right before you run a prompt, when you want to verify that nothing important has been missed.</p><p>Once a design already exists, <strong>short, targeted prompts tend to outperform any framework</strong>. One change. One target.</p><figure><img alt=""Prototype created by applying a PRD-inspired prompt shaped by the techniques explored in this article."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KOEOPQIVS2zeUMGanM8kuQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Prototype created by applying a PRD-inspired prompt shaped by the techniques explored in this article.</figcaption></figure><h3>Applying this in practice</h3><p>After studying these approaches, I applied them to a real use case to see what actually held up.</p><p>I used a marketplace browsing experience similar to Etsy because it reflects the kind of work many designers deal with day to day. Search, filters, product grids, seller identity, favorites, responsive behavior, and accessibility are all common requirements on real product teams. This wasn’t a demo scenario. It was something I could realistically see a team needing to prototype.</p><p>I set one constraint up front: <strong>one prompt, no edits</strong>.</p><p>The goal wasn’t to keep nudging Make until it behaved. It was to push as much decision-making as possible into the prompt itself and see whether a single input could produce a functional result without follow-up corrections. The prototype mattered, but <strong>the real focus was the prompt</strong>.</p><p>For comparison, a previous <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/i-built-a-game-app-in-figma-make-41c54b89fd7f"">Figma Make game app</a> project I built completely from scratch took around <strong>680 prompts over four days</strong>. This experiment took closer to <strong>40 prompts and about eight hours</strong>. The difference wasn’t UI complexity. It was <strong>how much structure existed before Make ever ran</strong>.</p><p>Getting to a <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LuUpmb4H52zfvORxAH2AQ8fLrxyncsFR2fPT1O-orT8/edit?usp=sharing""><strong>single prompt</strong></a> that could generate a fully functioning prototype without edits was time-consuming. Each prompt run took roughly <strong>10 to 15 minutes</strong>, and as the prompt grew longer, Make would sometimes skip over details that were already written. That meant certain requirements had to be reinforced more than once.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/7a31f61c7fa063786f6175e058325526/href"">https://medium.com/media/7a31f61c7fa063786f6175e058325526/href</a><p>In practice, those gaps were easy to fix by asking Make to review the prompt again and adjust specific areas. But that wasn’t the experiment. The experiment was to see <strong>how far a one-pass prompt could realistically go on its own</strong>.</p><p><em>I didn’t fully reach that goal.</em></p><p>In some runs, the prompt produced exactly what I asked for. In others, small but important things broke or behaved inconsistently. Filters didn’t respond as expected. Menu states worked in one run and failed in another. Hover text occasionally rendered unreadable. None of these issues were hard to fix with additional prompting, but needing to fix them at all was the point. <strong>The variability mattered</strong>.</p><p>Based on this work, I don’t think Figma Make is consistently there yet. It’s close, but <strong>not reliable enough to guarantee that outcome every time</strong>.</p><p>To be honest, this was frustrating. <strong>Figma Make is an innovative tool</strong> and a clear signal of where design workflows are headed, but it still feels closer to a beta product than a finished one. It’s powerful for prototyping and exploration, but there’s work left to be done, especially as it moves toward a <a href=""https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/33459875669015-How-AI-credits-work""><strong>credit-based model</strong></a>. Being charged for prompts that <strong>fail, drift, or ignore requirements</strong> is a real concern.</p><p>At the same time, I don’t think this is a static system. Figma has a strong track record of iterating quickly, and I expect many of these rough edges to improve as Make matures. Even so, the direction is clear. <strong>Prompting is becoming part of day-to-day design work</strong>, and cost will increasingly be tied to <strong>how clearly intent is defined up front</strong>.</p><p>That’s why <strong>understanding how to write clear, effective prompts matters now</strong>. This isn’t about perfection. It’s about being prepared for how design workflows are changing and what that change will cost.</p><p>I wrote this because I couldn’t find the article I wanted when I started. One that showed <em>real prompts, real tradeoffs, and real constraints</em>.</p><p>If this helps you approach prompting with more confidence and intention, it did its job.</p><h3>References</h3><ul><li>Showalter, Jesse. <em>Using Figma Make to Go From Nothing to Interactive Prototypes</em>.

<h4>A story from the field: the day safeguarding became real</h4><figure><img alt=""Laptop, phone and book chained together, symbolising safeguarding and data security in user research fieldwork.

Source: Pexels.</figcaption></figure><p>During a discovery project, I was visiting education settings across England to run in‑person research. That meant working inside real-world constraints: safeguarding processes, visitor protocols, staff availability, young people moving through corridors, rooms that suddenly became unavailable, and the constant awareness that you’re a guest in someone else’s environment.</p><p>At one site, we were told (almost casually) that more than half the staff were off sick with COVID, and another bug was doing the rounds. The cherry on top was that we were crammed into a small basement room that was colder than the rest of the building, so no ventilation, and a very high chance of catching whatever was circulating.</p><p>Two days later, I was ill. I stayed ill for weeks. I couldn’t take sick leave due to tight deadlines and stakeholders picking on any leave taken as “delaying the project”.</p><p>That was my reminder that:</p><blockquote>Safeguarding isn’t only about what happens <strong>in</strong> the session. It’s also about what happens <strong>around</strong> the session: infection risk, travel load, lone working, fatigue, access, and the logistics nobody puts on the Gantt chart, including allowance for sick leave.</blockquote><p>And if you think that’s “just wellbeing” …well, it isn’t. It’s research quality. When researchers are depleted, rushed, anxious about getting to the next site, or taking avoidable health risks, the work gets worse. Decision-making gets shakier, debriefs get skipped, boundaries blur, and the conditions for ethical, high-quality research quietly erode.</p><p>The safeguarding plan template I share with you (at the end of this article) is informed by what I now call “interesting” field notes (though at the time, they were mildly psychosis‑inducing events!). I’m sharing 7 field notes to set the stage for why (and I cannot emphasise this enough) a safeguarding plan really matters.</p><h4>Field note #1: the invisible entrance</h4><p>On one visit, I arrived at what looked like a massive establishment, but couldn’t find the entrance. Construction work, temporary buildings, and exactly zero signposting added to the pain. I spent the first 15 minutes convincing myself I’d come to the wrong place, while my Uber driver (now a distant memory) had left me in what felt like a no-man’s-land.</p><p>I rechecked Google Maps like 50 times, reread my emails and tried contacting the reception by calling but no luck.</p><p>Eventually, a stranger appeared, also going to the same place, pointed me to the entrance like a human “you are here” sign. It was like going through a maze!</p><p>No one had done anything malicious in this case. I’d sent confirmation emails. They’d replied. We’d all behaved like professionals. But nobody had thought to say:</p><blockquote>“Entrance is currently around the back, follow the temporary fencing and come through the metal gates where all the clinical waste bins are lined up, and ignore the sign that lies.”</blockquote><p>It wasn’t their “fault”. It was the assumption that got me. I did not treat basic navigation and access as part of safeguarding. The fix, is boring and brilliant:</p><blockquote>Ask for <strong>photos of the entrance</strong>, a <strong>named contact with a mobile number</strong>, and a plan for what happens if you can’t get in within 10 minutes.</blockquote><figure><img alt=""Building entrance hidden behind construction work (scaffolding) and confusing signage.

It had the architectural charm of a storage unit and the safety profile of, let’s say, “optimistic”.</p><p>One evening, we were preparing for a large-scale randomised controlled trial. We were printing and packing hundreds of consent forms, participant information sheets, and supporting documentation (ethical approval, what you need to know etc.). The kind of admin tasks that convinces you that your PhD is mainly an advanced qualification in stapling and packing envelopes.</p><p>Due to the looming deadline, I stayed late. A few others stayed late too.</p><p>At some point, without noticing, I became the last person in the building. And for some reason the main door would not open. I was stuck, and it was way past lone‑working hours. There were no CCTV cameras inside the building, and the dread of my supervisor finding out (and then them getting in trouble) was doing a lovely little duet with my panic response.</p><p>I called a friend who lived nearby. Luckily, they were home and they came and got me out.</p><p>Weeks later, I found out a different office in that same building had caught fire because a student smoked inside a wooden shed and left a still‑lit cigarette butt in a bin full of paper. The fire alarm did its job (thankfully). However, the final-year PhD student’s work couldn’t be rescued.</p><p>I’m sharing this because it’s the most predictable safeguarding lesson in academia (and beyond):</p><blockquote>Lone working isn’t a badge of honour. It’s a risk that needs a plan.</blockquote><h4>Field note #3: the re‑traumatisation</h4><p>Now for the one that still makes my eye twitch.</p><p>There was an opening event for a trial involving eating disorders. An influencer with lived experience was invited (paid to attend by public funding!). A media presence was expected. The senior investigator bragged about having “useful connections” in high places (because nothing says “scientific rigour” like name‑dropping your minister cousin).</p><p>Thank goodness the broadcaster didn’t show up, and neither did the “very important cousin”.</p><p>But what did happen was worse in a quieter way: there were clearly people in the room being impacted by the choices made around food, messaging, and the theatre of it all. It was a masterclass in how a team can be so focused on “PR” that they lose sight of basic emotional safety.</p><p>Putting large quantities of food and drinks in front of people (including the influencer herself) was not thoughtful. It was triggering for many because they were there due to lived experience of battling severe eating disorders that included <strong>anorexia, bulimia and so on</strong>… and then you have staff enthusiastically eating and drinking through it all.</p><p>That experience sharpened a point I now say out loud in project kick-offs:</p><blockquote>You can have all the ethics paperwork in the world. If your team culture treats re‑traumatisation as an abstract risk rather than a real human outcome, you don’t have safeguarding, you have compliance cosplay.</blockquote><p>And if the most senior person is the risk, you need a pre-agreed speak‑up route (not just “be brave”). A stop rule. A named escalation contact outside the immediate hierarchy, and a culture where safeguards are rehearsed, not improvised. In academia, the ethics board that approved the study is one route of escalation.</p><figure><img alt=""Measuring tape wrapped around an apple symbolising diet and eating disorders.

Source: Pexels.</figcaption></figure><h4>Field note #4: the day the institution-to-institution relationship collapsed</h4><p>Here’s a scenario I wish more safeguarding plans covered: governance collapse.</p><p>I once travelled across the country for fieldwork in a healthcare setting. Everything looked “approved” on paper. Then I arrived, and suddenly I had no access. Nobody would speak to me and I was told to wait in reception for hours. Doors that should have opened didn’t. The relationship between the university and the partner organisation had fractured at a senior level, and I’d been left out of the loop.</p><p>So there I was with wasted travel cost, time, energy, preparation and a hard stop. This is safeguarding too.</p><blockquote>Because safeguarding is also about protecting the <strong>work</strong> and the <strong>researcher</strong>. If a breakdown in institutional comms can strand you physically, professionally, and emotionally (and sometimes financially), then it needs to sit in the risk register like any other operational risk.</blockquote><p>The question we rarely ask is who covers what? Before I now travel for fieldwork, I confirm insurance/indemnity and cancellation rules:</p><ul><li>who covers travel costs if access collapses,</li><li>whether professional indemnity/public liability applies (especially if contracting), and</li><li>who has authority to pause/stop fieldwork if safety conditions change.</li></ul><h4>Field note #5: families as a risk variable</h4><p>In social care settings, there’s another layer that rarely makes it into tidy templates:</p><blockquote>Families can be protective and brilliant, and they can also be chaotic, accusatory, and sometimes actively harmful.</blockquote><p>During my time working in social care and in an NHS rehab service, I’ve seen families raise serious concerns that were absolutely legitimate and needed action.</p><p>I’ve also seen families create issues where there were none. And I’ve seen situations where family members were taking money from someone in care, then implying it was the setting’s fault or that the staff “didn’t do their job properly” and attempting to escalate formally.</p><p>As researchers, we don’t prosecute. But we do need to plan for:</p><ul><li>third‑party risk,</li><li>allegations and counter‑allegations,</li><li>reputational volatility,</li><li>and the possibility that “what’s true” is not always clear in the moment.</li></ul><h4>Field note #6: when the VPN and firewall are so safe they break the research</h4><p>In one organisation, we assumed the laptops provided would seamlessly connect to Wi‑Fi on sites being visited. Trust me when I say: they did not. The firewall and VPN were so secure that even the host IT team couldn’t troubleshoot the connection.</p><p>The result was that MS Teams wouldn’t run, recording didn’t work, and there was no built‑in audio recording on the laptop. I also didn’t have a dedicated work mobile, so using my personal phone to capture audio would have breached policy.</p><p>We defaulted to note-taking, but even that became an issue because uploads to the analysis tool kept failing. We ended up with an incomplete dataset and analysis that relied far too much on memory.</p><p>Safeguarding lesson here is that you need a pre‑agreed offline plan (confirming Wi‑Fi access arrangements and device/VPN constraints in advance of the visit, approved recording routes, secure note templates, and a contingency for when tech fails), especially in high-stakes/high-security settings.</p><p>Another important thing to note is that in high-security settings like prisons, secure mental health hospitals, and immigration environments, safeguarding escalates because power imbalance is built into the setting. Recording may be prohibited altogether, device access may be restricted or denied, staff may be present in the session impacting what is said and shared, and “voluntary participation” can be complicated. For such settings, your safeguards need to be even more robust and explicit like having a paired working and no lone-working at all.</p><h4>Field note #7: not everyone is willing to participate</h4><p>One of the biggest lessons I learned is that not everyone will participate, even when your intentions are good and your paperwork is flawless. In some communities, trust is not easy to earn.</p><p>I’ve turned up at settings where I simply couldn’t access the voices I came to hear. Some communities have rational reasons for being cautious: history, extraction, misrepresentation, and previous “research” that didn’t translate into change.</p><p>This taught me that refusal is data too, not a failure. Safeguarding here means:</p><blockquote>Designing for cultural safety and voluntariness which may look like working through trusted community connectors, using culturally appropriate facilitators where needed, offering different modes of participation, and being explicit that saying “no” to participation has no consequences.</blockquote><figure><img alt=""Human holding a banner saying ‘No’ against a yellow background.

They’re pragmatic. They improve safety, choice, and trust, which tends to improve the quality of what people are able (and willing) to share.</p><p>In research terms, a trauma‑informed lens pushes you to design sessions where participants:</p><ul><li>know what’s coming,</li><li>have meaningful control,</li><li>can opt out without penalty,</li><li>and aren’t pushed into disclosure “for the sake of insight”.</li></ul><p>It also forces a professional acknowledgement that researchers can be impacted too by vicarious trauma, fatigue, stress, and the physical reality of operating in high‑pressure systems.</p><h4>2) Factoring in incentives (as a safeguarding decision, not just admin)</h4><p><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9631331/"">Incentives can reduce barriers to participation</a>, but they can also create pressure, bias, or risk.</p><p>I treat incentives as part of safeguarding:</p><ul><li>It must never be framed as “payment for disclosure”.</li><li>It should not be conditional on answering every question or completing the session fully (especially in the digital world where 45 minutes into a 60 minute session, the connection breaks, or a participant faces issues when re-joining the session).</li><li>It must be safe and discreet to deliver (cash can create risk; digital delivery can create privacy issues where emails, bank account details are shared).</li><li>It <a href=""https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/research-and-innovation/research/Assets/Documents/PDF/ethics-incentives-reimbursement-etc-v5.pdf"">should be equitable</a>: if we pay for time, we should consider expenses and participation costs (travel, childcare, food etc.).</li></ul><p>And yes, incentives can attract misrepresentation. People may tell you what they think gets them “into the study”, or what they think will please you. That’s not a reason to remove incentives; it’s a reason to:</p><ul><li>design screening carefully and thoughtfully,</li><li>avoid recruitment through coercive gatekeepers,</li><li>and be clear that incentives are not linked to “performing” as a good participant.</li></ul><h4>3) Consent and assent (done properly, not performatively)</h4><p>This is the part that matters most, especially when vulnerable people are involved.</p><p><a href=""https://www.hra.nhs.uk/planning-and-improving-research/best-practice/informing-participants-and-seeking-consent""><strong>Consent</strong></a><strong> for adults with capacity</strong> must be informed, freely given, specific, and ongoing (reconfirm at key moments).</p><p><strong>Children: </strong><a href=""https://www.hra-decisiontools.org.uk/consent/principles-children.html#:~:text=Consent%20is%20a%20legally%20defined,their%20capacity%20when%20seeking%20assent.""><strong>consent + assent</strong></a></p><ul><li>Parental/guardian consent may be required (depending on policy and age).</li><li>Child assent should still be sought even when an adult has consented on their behalf.</li></ul><p>Assent is not a tick-box. It’s the child’s affirmative agreement, expressed in age-appropriate ways. And here’s what it may look like:</p><ul><li>If the child does not want to take part, verbally or non‑verbally, we stop.</li><li>If the child wants to stop partway through, we stop.</li><li>If the child wants to skip a question, we skip it.</li></ul><p>No negotiation. No persuasion. No “just one more question.”</p><p><strong>Vulnerable adults/adults who may lack capacity: </strong><a href=""https://www.cqc.org.uk/guidance-regulation/providers/regulations-service-providers-and-managers/health-social-care-act/regulation-11""><strong>supported decision‑making + assent</strong></a></p><ul><li>Use supported decision-making (plain language, time, breaks, visuals, accessible formats).</li><li>Check understanding by asking them to explain back (in their own words) what will happen, what will be recorded, and that they can stop.</li></ul><p>If a person cannot understand/retain/weigh the information or communicate a decision even with support:</p><ul><li>you cannot rely on their consent alone,</li><li>you may need a legally authorised representative process (depending on jurisdiction/policy),</li><li>and you should still seek the person’s assent and monitor for distress or dissent.</li></ul><p>And again: if they show they don’t want to continue, we stop.</p><p><strong>Gatekeepers (who protect voluntariness)</strong><br />Teachers, carers, clinicians, managers, and yes, prison staff, can enable access and unintentionally pressure participation. Build in:</p><ul><li>a private opt‑out route,</li><li>clear “no consequence” language,</li><li>and a cooling-off window where appropriate.</li></ul><h3>5 things I now do before I enter any setting (and why)</h3><p>These are the “unsexy” steps that make fieldwork safer, and prevent heroics from becoming the plan:</p><h4>1) Map safeguarding on both sides (and confirm clearance)</h4><ul><li>Identify the host setting’s safeguarding lead and read their safeguarding policy before you arrive.</li><li>Identify your organisation’s safeguarding lead and escalation route.</li><li>Make sure both ends know how to reach each other quickly.</li><li>Confirm clearance requirements early (e.g., enhanced DBS, prison/security vetting, NHS site rules). If clearance won’t land in time: pivot method early.</li></ul><h4>2) Build a fieldwork tracker (treat it like an asset, not admin)</h4><p>Document:</p><ul><li>where you’re going (exact building location),</li><li>photos of the entrance if it’s a complex site,</li><li>who you’re meeting (names where appropriate, roles, agreed contact details),</li><li>a named contact with a mobile number,</li><li>timings, check‑in/out times, contingency routes,</li><li>language requirements (do participants communicate in English; do you need an interpreter).</li><li>Inform the setting that you’ll need to access their network and ask for WiFi and device connectivity early on so you avoid delays on the day.</li><li>Create a separate tracker for your participants where you use participant IDs but keep participant contact details separate.</li><li>Have a tracker for research work where you keep a record of what was recorded, with whom, who conducted the session, who took notes, who observed, what supplementary material was provided, if you upload the material and notes etc. For online research, you can adapt this tracker (links, time zones, backup numbers, “what if the platform fails”).</li><li>For data security, upload to secure storage promptly, and don’t rely on “I’ll sort it later” when you’re travelling.</li></ul><h4>3) Treat public health as part of safeguarding (post‑COVID reality)</h4><p>Before in‑person work:</p><ul><li>ask the site about outbreaks or visitor restrictions,</li><li>confirm PPE expectations (even if “optional”),</li><li>decide in advance what triggers a reschedule or a switch to remote.</li></ul><h4>4) Plan reset capacity like it’s a delivery constraint (because it is)</h4><ul><li>Cap the number of intensive visits per week.</li><li>Build half-day resets into schedules where needed.</li><li>Protect debrief time as non‑negotiable (not a “nice to have”).</li></ul><p>People who haven’t done fieldwork often only see the interview hour. They don’t see the off-stage work: ethics, documentation, travel (and all the drama of delays and connectivity), relationship management, safeguarding alignment, the emotional labour of holding space, and the operational coordination required to get usable data without harming anyone.</p><p>So if your team asks for frequent check-ins or expects you to do additional work, ensure that you set their expectations by walking them through all the off stage work needed.</p><h4>5) Run a dynamic risk assessment on the day (including semi‑public spaces)</h4><p>Conditions change fast: staffing, space, local incidents, illness levels, travel disruption. Your plan needs a mechanism for responding without stress.</p><p>And if you’re observing in semi‑public spaces (corridors, waiting rooms, receptions): plan for bystanders who didn’t consent. Decide what you record, how you protect privacy, and when you pause or reposition.</p><h3>My template (use it and adapt it)</h3><p>I’m sharing the template I now use as a default for discovery projects, user research and service design work across education, health, social care, pharmaceutical, justice, and other high‑stakes environments.</p><p>It’s intentionally written as a template: you’ll need to tailor it to your organisation’s safeguarding policy, ethics process, and the host setting’s local requirements.</p><p>If you’re working with children or vulnerable adults, you should always align the plan with the host organisation’s safeguarding lead and your own organisational safeguarding lead before fieldwork starts.</p><h3>Safeguarding plan template for research (and design)</h3><h3>1. Document control</h3><p>Table 1 shows the data fields that you can use for document control.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of a table showing document control data fields."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TanZZ_EDe27dSYWzyrZ7gg.png"" /><figcaption>Document control data fields. Screenshot by the author.</figcaption></figure><h3>2. Purpose and scope</h3><p>This plan sets out how we prevent harm, recognise distress or risk, respond to concerns (including disclosures), and learn from incidents. It covers:</p><ul><li>Participant safeguarding (physical, psychological, cultural, and digital safety)</li><li>Researcher safeguarding (physical safety, psychological wellbeing, and lone-working)</li><li>Safeguarding of third parties (people mentioned during research, bystanders, or dependents)</li><li>Data governance and reporting practices that reduce risk and re-identification</li><li>Decision-making for consent, capacity, and involving guardians or gatekeepers</li><li>How participants raise concerns/complaints after participation (include contact details on information sheets and at session close)</li></ul><h3>3. Principles (proposed by</h3><p>We adopt a <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-definition-of-trauma-informed-practice/working-definition-of-trauma-informed-practice"">trauma-informed approach</a> and embed these principles into recruitment, consent, session design, data handling, analysis, and reporting:</p><ul><li>Safety (physical and psychological)</li><li>Accessibility (physical and remote)</li><li>Trustworthiness</li><li>Collaboration</li><li>Choice and transparency</li><li>Empowerment</li><li>Cultural considerations (including gender responsiveness)</li><li>Recognising where there may be a potential for re‑traumatisation, and preventing it</li></ul><h3>4.

Risk assessment (before fieldwork)</h3><p>Complete a safeguarding risk assessment for the topic, participant group, methods, and setting (in-person/remote). Use the risk matrix in Appendix A.</p><p><strong>At minimum, assess:</strong></p><ul><li>Sensitivity of topic and likelihood of triggering content</li><li>Participant vulnerability (age, disability, trauma exposure, dependency, power imbalance)</li><li>Setting risks (home visits, public spaces, care settings, online sessions)</li><li>Researcher exposure (secondary trauma, lone-working, travel, hostility)</li><li>Observers/note takers: their needs, triggers, and responsibilities (they’re part of the safeguarding environment too)</li><li>Data risks (identifiers, recordings, storage access, retention)</li><li>Third‑party risks (information about children/dependents/others)</li><li>Language and culture as barriers to participation; plan accordingly</li></ul><p><strong>Additional in-person fieldwork risks (especially post‑COVID):</strong></p><ul><li>Public health/infection-control risks (outbreaks, PPE/visitor rules, ventilation, hand hygiene)</li><li>Clinical/biohazard risks where applicable (follow site infection-control protocols/training)</li><li>Travel and fatigue risks (long days, commute safety, late finishes)</li><li>Environmental/neighbourhood risks (area safety, transport availability, accessibility, lone travel after dark)</li></ul><p><strong>High-security settings (prisons/secure hospitals):</strong></p><ul><li>restricted devices/recording, staff presence of in the sessions, coercion risk, emergency procedures, lockdown/incident response.</li></ul><p>Plan for a dynamic risk assessment on the day.</p><h3>6. Recruitment, screening, and participation support (including incentives)</h3><p>Recruitment must be voluntary, proportionate, and designed to avoid coercion.</p><ul><li>Use plain-language invitations and information sheets</li><li>Avoid recruiting via a person with direct power over the participant where possible (manager, teacher, clinician, prison staff). If unavoidable, add safeguards to protect voluntariness.</li><li>Screen for immediate risk: if a participant is in acute crisis, signpost support and do not proceed.</li><li>Plan accessible formats (easy-read, large print, multiple languages, captions)</li></ul><p>Incentives, reimbursement, and participation costs:</p><ul><li>Equity: consider reimbursement for expenses and costs of participation (including for staff, service users, or people in custody, subject to policy).</li><li>Document: amount, rationale, delivery route, timing, and what personal data is required to pay it.</li><li>Confirm host policies: e.g., whether staff can accept gifts, and prison rules on incentives.</li><li>Document potential issues: undue influence, misrepresentation, and how you’ll mitigate (neutral framing, ethical screening, opt‑out preserved).</li></ul><h3>7. Consent and capacity (adults, vulnerable adults, children)</h3><p>Consent is ongoing, informed, and freely given. Use staged consent for recordings, artefact review, and attribution. Reconfirm at key moments.</p><p>Operational note: don’t assume digital consent will work. Bring printed packs for in-person sessions, or allow time at the start of remote sessions to complete consent. Confirm verbally and record confirmation; have a second team member witness if required.</p><p>Table 3 shows a worked example of a decision pathway that you can adapt.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of a decision pathway for consent and assent."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mxrX5ynibKw3U7Cq3kghDw.png"" /><figcaption>Decision pathway for consent and assent. Screenshot by the author.</figcaption></figure><p>Capacity checks (use appropriate local framework):</p><ul><li>Explain in a way the person can understand (visuals/easy read as needed)</li><li>Check understanding (ask them to describe what will happen and their right to stop)</li><li>If they cannot understand/retain/weigh/communicate a decision even with support, do not take consent from them alone</li></ul><p>Provide complaints/concerns contact details on the info sheet and repeat at close.</p><h3>8. Participant safeguarding during sessions</h3><p>Build “safety by design” into every touchpoint.</p><p><strong>Baseline safeguards:</strong></p><ul><li>Content warnings and a plain-language roadmap</li><li>“Menu of participation” (topics, depth, mode, anonymity)</li><li>Choice throughout (breaks, camera off, written chat, skip questions)</li><li>Use redacted/synthetic artefacts by default</li><li>Normalise opting out without explanation</li><li>Support signposting at start and end</li><li>Avoid leading and probing language; also avoid pathologising terms</li><li>Close with a grounding option if useful</li></ul><p><strong>Remote-session enhancements:</strong></p><ul><li>Confirm participant is in a safe/private space; offer “switch topic” / “stop now” phrase</li><li>Collect emergency contacts only where needed</li><li>Use secure platforms; lock meetings; manage screen-sharing/chat safely</li><li>If using an AI tool to record for later notes and analysis, inform the participant. Build that into your consent forms</li><li>If remote observation is allowed, inform the participant. It’s unethical to allow a session to be watched by 10 observers via tools such as <a href=""https://info.heymarvin.com/marvin-ai-research-software-fe?utm_campaign_id=&amp;utm_term=marvin%20software&amp;utm_campaign=gs_cpc_brand_maxconv_kwds_marvin&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=2315755094&amp;hsa_cam=23058402392&amp;hsa_grp=186754625740&amp;hsa_ad=787418153179&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-344036103553&amp;hsa_kw=marvin%20software&amp;hsa_mt=e&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=23058402392&amp;gbraid=0AAAAApcRwVqn4UhpUqzsCm0IRRpNJaX_3&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAgvPKBhCxARIsAOlK_EqA5zmRIA3LuPAbVm0AL8IK5ScvprJuNTXpcqAO_6Juxk3zpnMLJg4aAqxCEALw_wcB"">Marvin</a> etc, while you introduced only one observer visible to the participant on MS Teams meeting. Build this into your consent materials and consent process</li></ul><h3>9. Managing distress, disclosures and safeguarding concerns</h3><p><strong>Distress script:</strong><br />“Let’s pause here. We can take a break or switch topic. You’re in control, and it’s okay to skip anything. Here are support options if you’d like them.”</p><p><strong>Disclosure script:</strong><br />“I’m concerned this may relate to someone’s safety. I need to pass this to the safeguarding lead/DSL.

From shielding skin from dry, cold weather to strengthening the skin barrier, proper hydration and moisture (which are two different things, both important: In layman's terms, hydration is more surface-level, lending an immediate softening, plumping effect to skin, while moisturizing locks in hydration via oils/butters to prevent evaporation.) is an essential step in your routine, and one worth investing in.<br /><br />I personally learned (the hard way, might I add) that neglecting moisturizer is honestly, one of the worst things you can do to your skin. As an acne-prone gal, I spent more years than I'd care to admit robbing my face of hydration in the hopes it would curb my breakouts, when in reality, it only exacerbated them since my sebum production skyrocketed as a result of dehydration.<br /><br />As beauty editors, we test hundreds of moisturizers a year, and as such, know a thing or two about the ones that actually work and the ones worth skipping. Ahead, the 12 best moisturizers for dry skin that really quenched our thirst.<br /><br /><em>At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.

Applying it feels like instant relief, thanks to a trifecta of moisturizing, hydrating ingredients. First up are ceramides, which act like glue between skin cells, keeping skin soft and healthy rather than rough and flaky. Then there’s shea butter, which dermatologists praise for its deeply moisturizing properties, alongside glycerin. Glycerin is both a humectant  (meaning it draws moisture into the skin) and an emollient, helping to keep that moisture locked in. Even though it’s a souped-up moisturizer, it never breaks me out. I must be on my fifth tub by now.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em><br /><br /><strong>The Inkey List</strong> Bio-Active Ceramide Repairing and Plumping Moisturizer, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fthe-inkey-list-bio-active-ceramide-repairing-plumping-moisturizer-P509315"">Sephora</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1080"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953333.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1080&amp;height=1080&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1080"" /><figcaption><h2>The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + PhytoCeramides Rich Moisturizer</h2><br />“When I need intense, long-lasting moisture during the driest of cold, arid weather, this is what I reach for every time.

In winter, cleansing my skin can leave it feeling so tight and rough it’s as though it might crack, but when I use this consistently, that never happens. U Beauty promises hydration for up to 48 hours, and it’s all down to five sizes of hyaluronic acid molecules that hydrate every layer of the skin. It doesn’t stop there, though.

It feels like wrapping your skin in silk, instantly calming thanks to oatmeal and allantoin. If I’ve overdone it on the Differin, this is the only thing that helps repair my skin barrier. But don’t just take my word for it — its five-star reviews speak volumes, with users praising the comforting whipped texture, its ability to soothe even eczema, and the fact that it contains no added fragrance or perfume, so it won’t aggravate sensitive skin.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em><br /><br /><strong>First Aid Beauty</strong> Ultra Repair Cream Intense Hydration, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.firstaidbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fultra-repair-cream-intense-hydration-new%3Fvariant%3D52718779695472"">First Aid Beauty</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952985.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1400&amp;height=1400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1400"" /><figcaption><h2>Sofie Pavitt Face Omega Rich Moisturizer</h2><br />“If you're dry and acne-prone, I truly cannot recommend a better moisturizer than <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sofie-pavitt-omega-moisturizer-review"">Sofie Pavitt's Omega Rich Moisturizer</a>.

Beneath the simple packaging, it feels and performs just like a high-end moisturizer. I’d expect nothing less — it’s Korean, after all. This cream cocoons dry, dehydrated, and sensitive skin with ceramides, which act like scaffolding to reinforce the skin barrier without leaving a greasy residue.

It’s more of a lotion than a thick cream, but don’t underestimate it. A blend of hydrating hyaluronic acid, antioxidant-rich grape water, and soothing chamomile extract is complemented by nourishing glycerin and shea butter.

January is the activation point. It represents the threshold where intention meets momentum. It’s energetic activation. The choices you make daily and the emotions you lock into can shape the rest of the year. <br /><br />As you may know, 2026 is the Year of the Fire Horse. It represents a year that conjures boldness, movement, and the willingness to run toward what calls you without looking back for approval. But none of that happens by accident. It happens because you choose it. Because only you can activate the frequency within yourself that matches the life you say you want.<br /><br />These tarotscopes aren’t predictive; they’re channeled directions. It’s Spirit showing you exactly what needs to come alive inside of you to make this year everything you've been building toward. This is your roadmap to alignment. It’s your permission slip to step into the fullest expression of who you came here to be.<br /><br />Read for your sun, moon, and rising signs. Let the messages land where they need to. And then do the work of activation.<figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954052.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Aries (March 21 - April 19) The Tower + Seven of Wands</strong><br /><br />Stop defending what's already dead and chasing past regrets. You’ve been fighting to keep structures standing that were never meant to survive your next level. Whether these are limiting beliefs or old shadows and traumas, this year requires you to activate your capacity for complete demolition. It’s not the gentle release you’ve been attempting, or possibly avoiding, but the full burn. The Tower is here to tell you that what needs to fall will fall, with or without your permission, and your job is to stop trying to save it. Instead, focus that warrior energy on claiming new ground and observing what the Tower’s destruction reveals to you about yourself and what you’ve allowed. Your best year comes when you stop protecting old territory and start building your empire from the ground up. Let it collapse. You were made to rebuild from nothing.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954053.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Taurus (April 20 - May 20) The Empress + Five of Pentacles<br /></strong><br />Activate your divine right to receive all the desires you want. You’ve been operating from scarcity consciousness while sitting on a throne, convinced you need to earn every crumb through suffering. That ends now. This year demands that you embody the Empress, the one who knows abundance is her birthright, not a reward for good behavior. Stop waiting for permission to live well and luxurious. Stop punishing yourself with lack and limitation as proof of your worthiness. Your best year unfolds when you plant yourself in the soil of your own value and refuse to negotiate. The harvest is already yours. Claim it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954054.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Gemini (May 21 - June 20) The Magician + Two of Swords<br /></strong><br />Your words are spells and your ideas are architecture. We all know this. This year, you need to activate your voice as your primary tool of manifestation, and that requires you to choose. You’ve been sitting on the fence, hedging your bets, and keeping your magic theoretical. That’s over. The Magician demands sharp decisions. It requires commitment, the willingness to speak your vision into being and then back it up with strategic action. Your best year happens when you stop intellectualizing and start declaring or delegating to your Spirits. Make the choice. Say it out loud. Then watch what you've been talking about finally take form.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954055.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Cancer (June 21 - July 22) The Moon + Strength<br /></strong><br />Cancer, this is vital: Trust your psychic knowing over everyone else’s logic. You've been letting other people’s fears override your intuition, second-guessing the visions that come to you in dreams, and apologizing for feeling everything. This year activates your emotional sovereignty. It’s the part of you that moves through the unknown with your inner compass as your only guide. Your best year comes when you stop treating your sensitivity like a weakness and start recognizing it as your superpower — no ifs, ands, or buts. The path isn’t clear, but your intuitive GPS is so sharp. Prepare to shock yourself. Ultimately, you’re not supposed to see the whole way. Move anyway. Your body knows.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954056.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Leo (July 23 - August 22) The Sun + Three of Cups<br /></strong><br />Shine like it’s your spiritual assignment, because it is. You’ve been dimming yourself to make others comfortable and performing humility like it’s a virtue. It’s not. This year demands that you activate your full radiance and let it be medicine for your community. Your best year unfolds when you stop rationing your gifts and start pouring them out like libations. Celebrate loudly. Gather your people. Let them see what it looks like when someone refuses to shrink. Your joy is your offering. Your brightness gives others permission. Stop playing small. It’s boring and it's beneath you.

You know how to refine the craft, but you’ve been using discipline as a weapon against yourself. There’s a difference between devotion and self-flagellation. This year asks you to honor the process without making yourself wrong for being in it. Your best year comes when you stop perfecting yourself into a corner and start building something that reflects your actual genius, not your fear of being exposed. You’re already good enough to do the work. Now do it without the side of shame.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954058.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Libra (September 23 - October 22) Justice + The Lovers<br /></strong><br />Choose yourself with the same conviction you use to choose everyone else. You’ve been sacrificing at the altar of other people’s comfort and maintaining peace at the expense of your power. This year demands reciprocity and equity. The scale is tipping in your favor for once. Your best year happens when you activate your understanding that self-selection is sacred, not selfish. Stop negotiating your needs down to make room for everyone else’s wants. This year is about you being selfish. The right people will meet you where you are. The wrong ones will reveal themselves. Both outcomes serve you.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954059.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Scorpio (October 23 - November 21) Death + Ace of Cups<br /></strong><br />You love transformation, the phoenix moment. But this year asks you to activate rebirth without the addiction to intensity. What if you could open to new love, new emotional terrain, and new beginnings without requiring everything to go up in flames first? Your best year comes when you learn that transformation doesn't have to hurt to be real. And you don't have to keep “healing” in order to learn important lessons. Let something be born from softness. Let yourself feel without destroying yourself in the process. You can change without the drama. Try it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954060.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Sagittarius (November 22 - December 21) Temperance + The Chariot<br /></strong><br />Harness your fire instead of letting it burn you out. You’re all acceleration, no integration. You’re moving so fast the lessons never land. This year activates your ability to embody your philosophy instead of just preaching it. This will bring your vision into your actual life instead of just talking about it. Your best year unfolds when you realize that sustainable momentum requires alchemy, not just speed. You don’t need to move faster. You need to move with purpose. Direct your energy. Let it build. And stop running from what you’re supposed to be learning.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954061.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Capricorn (December 22 - January 19) The Devil + Ten of Pentacles<br /></strong><br />Capricorn, activate pleasure as power.

Legacy without luxury is just suffering with better branding. This year demands that you let yourself enjoy what you’ve created. The chains are self-imposed. The key has always been in your hand. Your best year comes when you stop making wealth mean deprivation and start building abundance that actually feels good to inhabit. You’ve earned the feast.

Your best year unfolds when you stop waiting for the revolution and start being it — in every area of your life. Your difference is your contribution. Your vision is valid. Now make it real.

This year demands that you activate your ability to take inspired action even when the path isn’t clear. You are rebuilding your entire life this year and on an elevated level. Your best year comes when you trust that your intuition is enough, that the way reveals itself as you walk it. Stop surrendering to paralysis and start surrendering to movement. You don't need the whole map. You just need to take the first step. The path builds itself beneath your feet.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jesstheebesttcolor/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jess Gonzalez</a>, Pravana color expert and celebrity colorist, predicts that bronde — a mix of blonde and brunette — will evolve, taking inspiration from fashion, specifically the neutrals in our closets, like khaki. “Soft, melted, and cozy is the vibe of khaki bronde,” says Gonzalez — but don’t let the word khaki put you off; it’s nowhere near green. “Using a color melting technique, khaki bronde is a muted gold with hints of ash,” explains Gonzalez, much like this color created by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jesstheebesttcolor/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tay Ramirez.</a> </p>



<p>The addition of darker, ashier tones dials down the intensity of the blonde, lending the overall finish a more organic-looking, lived-in effect. “It flatters a wide range of skin tones, and it’s great for clients that want their hair to look natural or natural-ish,” says Gonzalez. She suggests asking for a “seamless lift and a color melt” over the top.  </p>

<p>Last year’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cowgirl-copper-hair-color"">cowgirl copper</a> is entering a new, brighter phase: soft apricot blonde. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/seanmichaelhair/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sean Michael</a>, owner of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thesalonbeau/?hl=en"">Salon Beau</a>, describes this as a “warm blonde with a subtle peach undertone,” occupying a cozy space between copper, strawberry blonde, and golden blonde. “It creates a bright and luminous look without the harsh contrast of icy or very cool blondes, which makes it appealing as more clients shift toward softer, warmer tones this year,” explains Michael. </p>



<p>Happily, he says this shade works well for both natural blondes and brunettes who want a vibrant result that still looks natural and blended.

<p>Barron-Hough describes lush truffle as a “sophisticated, expensive-looking shade that’s full of warmth, glowy tones, and indulgent truffle pigments.” She adds, “This trend reflects a shift away from cooler brown hues towards rich brunettes with a slightly warm, red glow.” Think Kelly Gale, Kiera Knightly, and Lana Del Rey — or curly hair specialist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jesseniaspallet?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jessenia Robayo</a> here.  </p>



<p>Barron-Hough says there isn’t a hair texture that it doesn’t look great on. For multi-textured hair, she suggests asking for a semi-permanent color. “This will add depth, tone, and lots of hydrating properties,” she says.  </p>

<p>Hazan says that striking blonde will be just as popular this year as it was in 2025, but this time, the focus is on dialing up the shine. The key? Investing in an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-hair-gloss-products"">at-home gloss</a>.

<p>Cashmere brunette is defined by a handful of very fine wisps of blonde throughout, rather than strong, high-contrast highlights, says Michael. “It reflects light evenly, photographs well, and grows out cleanly, which makes it a good option for people who want a lower-maintenance color that still has dimension,” he adds. </p>



<p>Michael says it looks especially beautiful on natural brunettes with medium to deeper skin tones. “It’s a strong choice for anyone who wants professional, polished, but healthy-looking color with longer wear between appointments.” This shade posted to Instagram by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DJg9HB5TQp8/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miho Mai</a> is beautiful. </p>

<p>Blanche blonde has “cloud dancer,” Pantone’s color of the year, to thank for its inception, says Gonzalez. “It’s a bright and ethereal pale blonde,” she explains. But it’s not for the fainthearted or those short on time. “A bold color like this requires monthly salon visits and treatments,” explains Gonzalez, specifically bonding treatments to counteract the drying effects of bleach. “It’s a high-maintenance color,” adds Gonzalez, “but when done right, it’s so striking.” She recommends asking for a bleach and tone with icy, milky highlights.

<p>Barron-Hough also makes a case for blanche blonde and has a feeling that it’s going to be <em>the </em>shade of 2026: “As blanche contains neither warm nor cool hues, it appears bright and ultra-reflective, making it a very fashion-forward look,” she says, adding that it looks especially cool on bobs and shorter cropped styles. </p>

<p>Highlights are getting an upgrade for 2026. At Haug, they’re delicately threaded into a darker base to create the illusion of depth, as though hair has been lightly sun-kissed rather than bleached. The goal? To make the color look as natural as possible, says Haug. And placement is paramount. Around the face, shoulders, and near the temples, where hair naturally has bounce, allows the highlights to really pop — like this shade by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DTGEcTPjPY2/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Annabelle Arnold</a>. </p>

<p>The<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/golden-globe-awards-red-carpet-fashion-2026""> 83rd annual Golden Globe Awards</a> took place last night (January 11), and by all means, it was business as usual for the official kick-off to the 2026 <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7594276237799968030"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">awards season</a>. Which, to be clear, isn’t a good thing. As anyone who’s logging onto social media, turning on their TV, or doom scrolling on their TikTok FYP daily knows, the times are anything but normal — and we shouldn’t be acting like they are. </p>



<p>Kicking off the show, often touted as Hollywood’s biggest party, two-time host <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/02/9339653/nikki-glaser-taylor-swift-apology"">Nikki Glaser </a>made a subtle allusion to the current political and social climate,<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hpHj5wNYDw""> welcoming celebs and viewers</a> to the event that was “without a doubt the most important thing happening in the world right now.” And then, that was pretty much it.</p>



<p>To recap: the past year has seen a brutal decimation of human rights across the United States. Since the start of his second term in office, President Donald Trump and his administration have <a href=""https://civilrights.org/trump-rollbacks/#2025"">rolled back DEI initiatives </a>across sectors, issued executive orders to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/birthright-citzenship-trump"">end birthright citizenship</a> and suspend the admission of refugees to the country, as well as targeted Transgender Americans by defining “sex” as binary and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/trump-transition-healthcare-funding-hhs"">proposing an immediate pause on gender-affirming</a> care. In addition to this, his administration has increased <a href=""https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/big-budget-act-creates-deportation-industrial-complex"">funding to United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)</a>, <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy9z7yg2n7o"">deploying the National Guard </a>into cities across the country and inciting violence. Earlier this month, a Minneapolis citizen, Renee Good, was <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jepdjy256o"">shot and killed by an ICE agent</a>. Oh, and the President of the United States is set to<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/jan/09/france-delays-g7-summit-white-house-ufc-trump-birthday""> hold a UFC figh</a>t this July to celebrate his 80th birthday, held on the White Houses’ South Lawn. (Which isn’t a social injustice, but <em>is</em> tacky as hell). </p>



<p>These are arguably the most unprecedented of unprecedented times; yet the Golden Globes felt like something straight out of  the 2016 feminism and activism handbook — ie: soap boxing with little to no substance. Talking around some of the most prevalent and dire issues of the moment without actually speaking to them in a way that would cause conversation or discomfort (which, to be clear, is needed). </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Look at the billions of eyeballs on all of us collectively, there should be no outliers of the industry who are the outspoken ones…out there on their own with this amount of privilege.”  </p><cite>Jameela Jamil </cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Presenting the award for Male Actor in a Limited Series, Anthology Series, Made for TV Movie, Kathryn Hahn and Melissa McCarthy took to the stage to sarcastically congratulate men on finally being recognized for their acting chops, as well as their abilities to show their range playing so many roles, as McCarthy put it “Husband! Ex-husband! Secretary! And everybody’s favorite: nosy neighbor.” It was a moment of comedy meant to be a tongue-in-cheek jab at ongoing conversations around men’s dominance in the profession that failed to be either funny or actually impactful. The feeling was similar to actress Natalie Portman’s now-infamous statement at the 2018 Golden Globes while presenting the award for Best Director, where she <a href=""https://deadline.com/2018/01/natalie-portman-all-male-directors-category-remark-prompts-reaction-golden-globes-1202238326/"">pointedly called out the categories’ list of all-male nominees</a>. It was a strong statement, until you consider the fact that — between 2018 and this year — Portman has herself worked with no female directors. (In the words of queen <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11932309/kirsten-dunst-female-directors-hollywood-tiff-2025"">Kirsten Dunst</a>: “<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11932309/kirsten-dunst-female-directors-hollywood-tiff-2025"">It’s very simple</a>” to work with female directors). </p>



<p>Later in the show, Noah Wyle, the hunky lead of hit HBO series <em>The Pitt  </em>– which unflinching depicts the reality of being a healthcare worker in America — picked up two Golden Globe Awards, during which he broadly thanked healthcare workers, without speaking to any of the current ways in which the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/26/us-health-insurance-system-doctors"">health care system is inaccessible </a>to the majority of Americans. And Nikki Glaser ribbed Leonardo DiCaprio for continuing to date women under 30 instead of questioning why someone who claims to be a climate activist would<a href=""https://variety.com/2025/biz/columns/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-wedding-bad-taste-1236442892/""> attend Jeff Bezos’ wedding</a>. And even though <em>One Battle After Another </em>is a satire about revolution, critiquing anti-immigration and extremist white nationalist groups, those issues weren’t directly addressed in the speeches when the film won. </p>



<p>It was…dissapointing to say the least. </p>



<p>Maybe this characterization is unfair. And some celebrities did subtly use their platforms for good last night. But the idea of asking and expecting celebrities to speak truth to power is nothing new. In fact, fans have been demanding it for years. Largely, these calls to action have been met with a divisive response from people both in and outside of the industry. In 2020, then- Golden Globes host <a href=""https://deadline.com/2020/01/golden-globes-politics-ricky-gervais-1202821552/"">Ricky Gervais directly warned celebrities</a> not to talk about politics in their acceptance speeches, saying:  “You’re in no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg. If you win, come up, accept your little award, thank your agent and your god, and fuck off.” </p>

<p>In 2021, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2024/01/11638286/golden-globes-2024-apolitical-genocide#:~:text=There%20is%20a%20long%20history,glitz%2C%20glamour%2C%20and%20escapism."">reflecting on that comment after yet another apolitical Golden Globe awards</a> ceremony, Refinery29’s Senior Content Director, Entertainment Kathleen Newman-Bremang wrote about understanding the inclination to want to tell stars to essentially “shut up and look pretty.” It’s one that many stars we look to seem to hold, or at least cower behind, themselves.</p>



<p>In a November 2025 interview, <em>Die My Love</em> actress Jennifer Lawrence spoke about her decision to not speak openly about her politics, specifically the actions of President Donald Trump. In an interview with The New York Times’ <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQotp7ejvJi/?igsh=eDVnZWtuNG41ZHFh""><em>The Interview </em></a>podcast, Lawrence said that, after spending the President’s first term “running around like a chicken with [her] head cut off,” she felt speaking out wouldn’t have an impact. “We’ve learned election after election, celebrities do not make a difference whatsoever on who people vote for,” Lawrence said. “So then what am I doing? I’m just sharing my opinion on something that’s going to add fuel to a fire that’s ripping the country apart. We are so divided.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>We need celebrities, with platforms and the ability to reach to and speak to people on every side of these issues, by virtue of their influence, to be vocal about the reality of what’s happening and what the impact is for everyone. </p><cite>katherine singh</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Lawrence went on to say that she wouldn’t want her personal politics to deter people from coming to see her films, media that, in her words, could “change consciousness or change the world.” While we admire the ambition and trust in her craft (and yes, it is true that art can literally change lives) — please, give us a break. Just say you don’t want to alienate people that will contribute to your bottom line. </p>



<p>But the fact remains that, despite what any comedians or Jennifer Lawrence may think, these celebrities and their platforms do have influence and can elicit change, especially when it comes to <a href=""https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/the_oprah_effect"">political leaders</a>. When Taylor Swift <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/sep/11/taylor-swift-endorses-kamala-harris-president-us-debate-cat-lady"">publicly supported Kamala Harris</a> ahead of the November 2024 Presidential election, sharing her intent to vote for the candidate on Instagram, she <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/taylor-swift-kamala-harris-endorsement-vote-gov/"">drove over 400,000 people</a> to the <a href=""http://vote.gov"">vote.gov</a> site over the next 24 hours. <em>Bridgerton</em> actress Nicola Coughlan, who has continued to post frequently to Palestinian aid organizations, has helped <a href=""https://tribune.com.pk/story/2476904/bridgerton-star-nicola-coughlan-raises-over-2-million-for-palestine-despite-hollywoods-warnings"">raise over $2 million USD</a> to date. </p>



<p>To be fair, that’s not to say that celebrities have completely eschewed speaking up and out about what’s currently happening in the country. Walking the red carpet ahead of the 83rd annual Golden Globes show, a handful of stars did speak out about the need for celebrities and lay people alike to be vocal about the current climate in the United States. Speaking to <em>Refinery29, Poker Face</em> actress Natasha Lyon, who donned a pin declaring ICE OUT, said: “I just think it’s important that we don’t normalize what’s going on in this country right now. I love America, I love us, I love our communities,  free speech, I love the Trevor Project and all that. I think it’s important. Renee Good, say her name.” Lyon was one of several actors, including Tessa Thompson, Wanda Sykes, and Mark Ruffalo, who wore pins that said “<a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2026/01/11/golden-globes-ice-protest-pin-mark-ruffalo-wanda-sykes/88134903007/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Be Good</a>,” speaking out against the actions of ICE and in support of Good and Keith Porter Jr., who was also killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. The <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/article/heres-why-stars-are-wearing-ice-out-and-be-good-pins-at-the-2026-golden-globes"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Be Good campaign</a> was launched by advocacy groups in response to ICE’s $1000 million “wartime recruitment campaign” aimed at expanding enforcement officers. <em>Hacks</em> star Hannah Einbinder also walked the carpet donning an <a href=""https://www.artists4ceasefire.org/about"">Artists4Ceasefire pin</a> — a red carpet fashion staple for her. </p>

<p>Later on the same carpet, actress Yvette Nicole Brown was even more explicit with her distaste for the current administration, telling <em>Refinery29</em>’s Unbothered the thing that’s bothering her deeply is, simply: “Our government. That orange ghoul that is terrorizing us everyday,” before warning viewers that “it’s about to be really real, get ready.” </p>



<p>And while accepting her third Golden Globe for Actress in a Musical or Comedy Series, <em>Hacks</em> star Jean Smart also took her moment on-stage to<a href=""https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a69966807/jean-smart-best-actress-tv-comedy-golden-globes-speech-transcript-2026/""> encourage viewers to take action</a>, saying: “There’s just a lot that could be said tonight; I said my rant on the red carpet, so I won’t do it here….But let’s all do the right thing. I think everybody in their hearts knows what the right thing is to do. So let’s do the right thing.” Smart was referring to earlier comments she made on the carpet, telling reporters that filming of the upcoming season of the show was overshadowed by the current goings on in the country, stating: “I feel like we’re kind of at a turning point in this country, and I hope people can keep their heads because that’s actually, really, the hardest thing, I think, is to keep our heads. It’s going to take a lot of courage and concerns, but I think that’s important.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954340.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=695&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A695"" /></figure>



<p>While fashion has long been political, and these small moments of resistance can be important,  it’s hard to feel like a handful of celebs donning obscured, teeny-tiny pins or making veiled comments about triumphing over fear is enough, or anywhere near enough — because it’s really not.</p>



<p>We need celebrities, with platforms and the ability to reach to and speak to people on every side of these issues, by virtue of their influence, to be vocal about the reality of what’s happening and what the impact is for everyone. We need these big names with big money and big studios attached to them to take action — whether that’s boycotting award shows or refusing to speak to anything other than these issues at this moment in time. </p>



<p>It feels like the bare minimum, and actress Jameela Jamil agrees. Speaking to <em>Refinery29 </em>at the Spotify x The Hollywood Reporter Golden Globes Nominees Night, the British actress — who is a vocal activist — spoke to the inability of many of her colleagues to speak out against injustices, pondering, “Am I brave or are they cowards?”</p>



<p>“I think they’re being greedy and weird and disappointing,” Jamil continued. “Look at the billions of eyeballs on all of us collectively, there should be no outliers of the industry who are the outspoken ones…out there on their own with this amount of privilege.” Jamil pointed to actors like Mark Ruffalo, who has<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DTZBbZLDI3c/?hl=en""> often and vocally spoken out against injustices</a>, noting that, when we look at people like him, we weaponize the word “brave” as a way to separate ourselves, removing ourselves from the expectation that we can and will do the same. “So we rely on individuals to do what would be so much easier to achieve as a collective.” </p>

<p>And if the Golden Globes are any indicator of what this upcoming awards season will hold when it comes to celebs speaking out, it feels like — once again — Ruffalo will be an outlier. </p>



<p>But as disappointing as the apoliticalness of this awards show was, maybe the bigger disappointment is the fact that we continue to hope and ask for anything different from those we look up to onscreen, and continue to be disappointed when they don’t follow through. Because truly, what can we really expect? At the end of the day, this industry is all about the bottom line. And our faves, who we idolize, meme, emulate and form a parasocial bond with, are largely going to stay on the side of the line that makes sure they get their bag – as long as these injustices don’t impact or affect them directly. </p>



<p>So, for the next few months, award show contenders, winners, and Hollywood ingenues will have the spotlight on them. As they have every other awards’ season, they’ll thank their families and agents; tearfully, they’ll talk about hardship and determination, picking themselves up and trying again. And maybe it’s time we stop hoping for more. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11615800.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>It’s 8 p.m. on a Saturday in 2023 on my 30th birthday and I am standing on my own, stone-cold sober, wailing my way through Robbie Williams’ “Angels” at a crowded Italian restaurant in London. Up until this moment, karaoke had always been something I would have never done without drinking, in part because of my fear that people would judge me or find me embarrassing. But here I was, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sober-curious-trend-companies"">a year into sobriety</a>, savoring the mad and euphoric feeling of being fully aware of my actions, surrounded by both loved ones and strangers, and not feeling a shred of social anxiety.</p>



<p>The biggest and most mortifying surprise of my life was just how much <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-non-alcoholic-drinks-to-buy"">fun I could have without drinking</a>. While I wouldn’t say I was addicted to alcohol, I was definitely dependent on it throughout my twenties — it was my social lubricant and tool for emotional regulation in unfamiliar settings. It’s how I celebrated, commiserated, and ended an otherwise banal work day. I’d come to expect drinking to always equal fun and therefore fun to always equal drinking.</p>



<p>There were of course plenty of times when this wasn’t true and the hangover, anxiety, and impact on my debit card showed it was far from worth it. But there was always the hope that this next dinner or night out or post-work drinks would be as glittering as some past one I remembered. Even when I’d tried reducing or stopping my drinking before — especially when I found it was triggering my debilitating <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/10/10714981/ocd-pandemic-photos-emotional-impact"">obsessive compulsive disorder</a> — I subconsciously held firm onto this idea that any fun I had sober would be even more fun when drinking.</p>



<p>It was only when I started a new medication for my OCD [Obsessive Compulsive Disorder] at the beginning of 2022 that I truly began to confront this idea. I stopped drinking and life went on. After a few pub evenings and birthday parties where I felt awkward and withdrawn, I began to embrace acting like a fool and being fully cognizant of it.</p>



<p>Celebrations became riotously fun as I had as much, if not more, fun as I ever did drinking. Two full years on, I maintain that stopping drinking is one of the best decisions I’ve made in my adult life. And more importantly, I’ve experienced all the fun and giddy glee sober that I was inadvertently chasing in a bottle.</p>



<p>This is why I am a firm believer that everyone who drinks should try life without alcohol in some capacity and that if you are considering quitting entirely, there’s no time like the present. But, now, as we roll into another unavoidably grey and miserly January, it is also why I think that for some, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dry-january-tips-las-vegas"">Dry January</a> (spending the whole month sober as a mental and physical reset) might not be the way you begin to experience the joy of a reduced or even alcohol-free life.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Celebrations became riotously fun as I had as much, if not more, fun as I ever did drinking.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>I want to be very clear that I’m not criticizing Dry January. It’s a really important initiative led by the brilliant charity <a href=""https://alcoholchange.org.uk/?gclid=CjwKCAiAsIGrBhAAEiwAEzMlC_dCV3SllAnAyUM_X49ajHaShnQGpiZKzdz4f3-Nxrp5Uy98bMp47xoCyIcQAvD_BwE"">Alcohol Change UK</a>, who do important work reducing alcohol harm. It also gives people a “socially acceptable” reason to stop drinking if they struggle with peer pressure. Moreover, people’s relationship with alcohol varies greatly — the more dependent or addicted you are, the more you need to <a href=""https://alcoholchange.org.uk/help-and-support/get-help-now"">consult a professional</a>, like your doctor, before making any big changes, and so the framing that works for me or someone else could be irrelevant for you.</p>



<p>There is no one-size-fits-all approach to reworking your relationship with alcohol, and for some people it may mean complete abstinence. <a href=""https://www.taraswart.com/"">Tara Swart Bieber</a><a href=""https://www.taraswart.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">, MD</a>, tells us: “If someone is misusing or abusing alcohol then medical supervision would be necessary if they wanted to stop. If someone stops and gets symptoms of withdrawal then they should contact their [doctor]. If they are drinking socially and not more than the recommended limits, then they can stop without medical guidance.”</p>



<p>My point though is that taking a month off, especially in January’s grim weather and post-holiday-decadence haze, can just reaffirm the idea that sobriety is boring. As Annabelle Bonus, director of research, policy and strategy at <a href=""https://www.drinkaware.co.uk/?gclid=CjwKCAiAsIGrBhAAEiwAEzMlCxuWH2oLE6dQY6DfPY08UEDAQ62RKzAReWwGTkHuavi6XOc83-pwNhoCZDAQAvD_BwE"">Drinkaware UK</a>, tells Refinery29: “Initiatives like Dry January can give people a really clear target if they want to cut down or try to stop drinking completely. While they work really well for some people, other people can find them hard to stick to and that’s completely normal.”</p>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/milliegooch/?hl=en"">Millie Gooch</a>, founder of <a href=""https://sobergirlsociety.com/"">Sober Girl Society</a>, a community safe space for sober women changing their relationship with alcohol, agrees. As an advocate for Dry January, she underlines why she supports the initiative. “Where people might have overdone it over the holiday season, Dry January can provide a much-needed break for your body and mind,” she says. “On the flip side, not much socializing happens in January and although this can make not drinking easier, it doesn’t give you as much of a chance to flex your sober socializing muscles.” This can mean the idea of a dinner/night out/festival sober maintains a veneer of intimidation.</p>



<p>The way I’ve combatted this is to focus on getting in at least one social activity where you would in the past have been drinking and experiencing it sober. This can be intimidating at first, especially if you experience social anxiety in social situations. But one big secret I only realized when I stopped drinking is that pretty much <em>everyone</em> feels that way in new social situations. I’ve learned that it will dissipate after an hour or so as people relax — whether they’re drinking or not. And riding that anxiety out becomes far less challenging as you keep trying.</p>



<p>“This [technique of riding out the anxiety] is one of the central tenets of exposure therapy,” explains Sheri Jacobson, PhD, a retired psychotherapist and founder of psychotherapy clinic <a href=""https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/sheri-jacobson.htm"">Harley Therapy</a>. “You can track your anxiety on a self-reported scale one to 10, and you will notice the anxiety comes down at each 10-minute interval that passes. Most things will dissipate over time.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>But one big secret I only realized when I stopped drinking is that pretty much <em>everyone</em> feels anxious in new social situations.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Dr. Jacobson emphasizes that it’s psychologically important to make positive associations around not drinking, whether that’s just for one evening or for the foreseeable future. </p>



<p>“What happens in drinking is that there’s a general lowering of inhibitions, which may allow us to speak more freely and be less anxious,” she explains. “The short-term motivation is that we gain these benefits of maybe being more sociable than we would be and a greater sense of freedom. In order to stop drinking, we have to look at the things that are negative for us, and then switch those into something more positive.”</p>



<p>The positives of not drinking are very clear to me. In my experience, it is not just those to your physical and mental health (though those are significant) but learning to overcome social anxiety in awkward situations, feeling at ease in yourself, having better ability to listen to your body when it says it needs food or rest, and then actively choosing to go home (or stay out). You can feel the crispness of euphoria in high definition without it being clouded by booze, you can dip out of repetitive, drunk conversations without anyone being offended (because they’re drunk), and save money. What’s even more fun is that you channel it into something else, be it something you’ve always wanted to try (pottery!) or silly little treats (chocolates!).</p>



<p>Drinking is fun and for many can be the spark that lights the best night of your life. But it doesn’t have to be. Whether you’re attempting Dry January or not, it’s truly worth trying to have a good night without it — one that’s not just calm and clarified but raucous and silly, if that’s what you need. </p>



<p>That won’t be guaranteed the first time you order a lime and soda at your local. As Bonus puts it: “With any sort of behavior change, like cutting down drinking, it should be thought of as a journey rather than something that’s going to change overnight.” But if you find a whole month a prescriptive suggestion or you’re worried that losing drinking will hamper your joy, I am proof that it won’t. And don’t let the grim weather trick you into believing otherwise.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951226.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings, this second week of 2026 brings a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/january-monthly-horoscope-2026-meanings-effects"">relatively calm astrological atmosphere</a>, especially compared to the intensity of recent weeks, offering space to slow down and reflect. On January 11th, the asteroid Vesta enters Aquarius, shifting our focus toward devotion beyond the self. Vesta, though less commonly discussed, represents what we tend to with quiet consistency, our inner flame and sense of purpose. In Aquarius, that devotion turns toward community, collective progress, and future-minded ideals. It’s a reminder to examine where we are giving our energy and whether those commitments truly align with the world we want to help build. </p>



<p>At the same time, we’re in the final stretch of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-capricorn-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Venus in Capricorn</a> and the last <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">full week of Capricorn Season</a>. With the sun, Mercury, Venus, and Mars all in Capricorn, the emphasis is on responsibility, long-term planning, and emotional maturity. This is a productive time to get organized financially and to have honest, clarifying conversations in both friendships and romantic relationships. The shadow of this energy, however, can show up as rigidity, emotional guardedness, or being overly hard on yourself. There may also be a temptation to equate security with control or accumulation rather than trust and reciprocity. </p>



<p>From January 15th through January 17th, we enter the dark-of-the-moon in Capricorn, the reflective days leading up to the Capricorn New Moon on January 18th. Energy can feel lower, emotions more sensitive, and internal pressure around goals or responsibilities may rise. Instead of pushing for answers or outcomes, this is a time to rest, reflect, and release what no longer feels sustainable. </p>



<p>The shift begins on January 17th, when Venus enters Aquarius, helping us loosen our grip and open up to new ways of relating. This week is less about taking action and more about conscious closure, creating space so the intentions set at the New Moon can take root with clarity and purpose. </p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, this week highlights a meaningful shift in your friendship, community, and technology sector as both Vesta and Venus move into Aquarius, with Vesta arriving on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th. Vesta’s presence asks you to reflect on where your energy, time, and loyalty have been going socially and digitally, and whether those commitments still feel aligned. As Venus joins Vesta later in the week, relationships within your wider circle take on a warmer, more intentional tone. You may feel drawn to reconnect with friends who inspire you, collaborate on creative or tech- forward ideas, or redefine what support and reciprocity look like in your community. This is a powerful moment to invest in connections that feel future-oriented rather than obligatory. </p>



<p>At the same time, you’re moving through the final <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">stretch of Capricorn Season</a>, which has activated your career and long-term goals sector. Over the past few weeks, you may have been pushed to take your ambitions more seriously, confront professional realities, or step into greater leadership and responsibility. </p>



<p>As we approach the Capricorn New Moon on January 18th, the days leading up to it mark the dark of the moon in this area of your life. This can stir doubts about whether you’re on the right path, highlight burnout, or make you more aware of the pressure you place on yourself to succeed. Instead of judging these feelings, allow them to surface as useful information. Rest where you can, reflect on what feels unsustainable, and release outdated definitions of success. This New Moon is about redefining your legacy on your own terms, and honoring the version of ambition that supports both your growth and your well-being. </p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, you may have felt yourself stretching beyond your comfort zone <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">all Capricorn Season</a>, and now these next few days are encouraging you to spread your wings even further. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, your career, visibility, and long-term aspirations sector is activated. Vesta brings focus and devotion to the work you’re building and the reputation you are cultivating, asking you to reconnect with what truly motivates you professionally. </p>



<p>As Venus conjoins Vesta, there is an opportunity to feel more supported, appreciated, or inspired in your public life. You may receive recognition, have meaningful conversations about your future, or feel drawn toward work that feels more aligned with your values and vision rather than just security. </p>



<p>At the same time, we’re in the final stretch of Capricorn Season, which has been activating your sector of growth, travel, education, and big-picture belief systems. Over the past few weeks, you may have been rethinking what expansion really looks like for you and which paths are worth committing to long term. </p>



<p>As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, doubts or restlessness can surface, especially around whether you are limiting yourself out of fear or practicality. This is not a sign that you’re oﬀ track, but an invitation to pause and reflect. Give yourself permission to rest, journal, or step back from decision-making. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will offer a reset around your direction and purpose, helping you set intentions for a future that feels both grounded and expansive, built on trust in your ability to grow beyond what feels familiar. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Capricorn Season</a> has been asking you to go deeper than usual, and this week invites you to look at growth through a more expansive, future-facing lens. On January 11th, Vesta enters Aquarius, followed by Venus on January 17th, activating your sector of higher learning, travel, publishing, and belief systems. Vesta encourages you to recommit to ideas, philosophies, or long-term visions that genuinely inspire you, especially ones connected to education, spirituality, or sharing your voice more widely. </p>



<p>As Venus conjoins Vesta this week, curiosity turns into pleasure and motivation. You may feel more excited about learning something new, planning a trip, teaching, or reconnecting with a sense of purpose that extends beyond day-to-day responsibilities. </p>



<p>At the same time, you are in the final stretch of Capricorn Season, which has been illuminating themes of intimacy, shared resources, emotional vulnerability, and trust. Over the past few weeks, you may have been navigating deeper emotional or financial conversations, confronting patterns around dependence, power, or security. As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, these themes can feel heavier, bringing up doubts, fatigue, or the urge to retreat. Rather than overanalyzing what surfaces, allow yourself space to rest and process. This is a powerful time to release emotional baggage or financial stressors that no longer align with who you are becoming. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will oﬀer a reset around how you merge, share, and commit, helping you build deeper connections and a more sustainable sense of emotional and material support.</p>

<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, this week may feel like a turning point in how you relate to the people closest to you. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, your sector of intimacy, shared resources, and emotional bonds is activated. Vesta asks you to reflect on where your emotional energy and loyalty have been going, especially in close relationships, financial partnerships, or situations that require mutual trust. </p>



<p>As Venus conjoins Vesta this week, conversations around vulnerability, support, and reciprocity can soften. This is a powerful moment to renegotiate emotional or financial agreements, deepen a bond through honesty, or choose connection that feels empowering rather than draining. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, you’re moving through the final stretch of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Capricorn Season</a>, which has been illuminating your partnership sector all month. Relationships of all kinds may have required more eﬀort, accountability, or emotional maturity than usual. As we enter the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, doubts or sensitivities around commitment, balance, or whether your needs are truly being met can surface. You may feel more emotionally exposed or tired of carrying relational weight on your own. Instead of reacting, allow yourself to pause and listen to what your emotions are revealing. Rest, create space, and release expectations that feel one-sided or outdated. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will bring a powerful reset for your relationships, helping you set intentions for partnerships that support your growth, emotional safety, and long-term fulfillment. </p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, this week invites you to rethink how you show up in your closest connections and daily commitments. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, your relationship sector is activated, bringing focus to partnerships, collaborations, and the give-and-take dynamics in your life. </p>



<p>Vesta asks you to reflect on where your devotion and energy are going within one-on-one connections, and whether those relationships feel reciprocal and aligned. As Venus conjoins Vesta this week, there’s an opportunity to soften tensions, reconnect through honest conversation, or attract partnerships that feel both supportive and intellectually stimulating. This can be a meaningful moment for redefining what commitment looks like for you moving forward. </p>



<p>At the same time, you’re in the final stretch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Capricorn Season</a>, which has been highlighting your work, routines, and overall well-being. Over the past few weeks, you may have felt pressure to be more disciplined, productive, or responsible with your time and energy. As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, fatigue, self-criticism, or doubts about sustainability can surface. This is your cue to slow down rather than push harder. Prioritize rest, simplify where possible, and release habits that drain you. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will oﬀer a reset around how you care for your body, manage your workload, and create routines that support both your ambition and your vitality. </p>

<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, this week encourages you to reconnect with joy, creativity, and the things that make life feel meaningful rather than merely productive. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, your sector of daily routines, work habits, and well-being is activated. Vesta asks you to reflect on how devoted you’ve been to your responsibilities and whether your current systems actually support your health and happiness. </p>



<p>As Venus unites with Vesta this week, there’s an opportunity to bring more pleasure, ease, and even creativity into your everyday life. You may feel inspired to refresh your schedule, collaborate differently at work, or prioritize routines that feel nourishing rather than obligatory. </p>



<p>At the same time, you’re in the final stretch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Capricorn Season</a>, which has been activating your sector of romance, creativity, and self-expression. Over the past few weeks, you may have been taking your passions or love life more seriously, questioning what feels worth your time and emotional investment. </p>



<p>As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, self-doubt, creative blocks, or emotional heaviness can surface, especially if you’ve been pushing yourself to perform or prove something. Instead of critiquing yourself, allow space for rest and reflection. Step back from perfectionism and release pressure around outcomes. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will bring a sense of renewal around joy and self-expression, helping you set intentions that honor both your creative desires and your need for stability. </p>

<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, this week invites you to slow down and get reacquainted with what truly feels like home. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and your ruler Venus following on January 17th, your sector of creativity, romance, pleasure, and self-expression is activated. Vesta asks you to reflect on where your heart has been investing its energy, whether in love, creative projects, or personal passions. </p>



<p>As Venus unites with Vesta this week, inspiration flows more easily, and you may feel drawn toward connections or pursuits that allow you to express yourself more freely and authentically. This is a beautiful moment to recommit to joy, play, and creative risks that feel aligned with who you are becoming. </p>



<p>At the same time, you’re in the final stretch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Capricorn season</a>, which has been emphasizing themes around home, family, and emotional foundations. Over the past few weeks, you may have been addressing responsibilities or boundaries within your personal life, possibly feeling the weight of expectations tied to your roots or living situation. </p>



<p>As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, emotions can run deeper, bringing up fatigue, sensitivity, or questions about where you truly feel safe and supported. Rather than forcing clarity, allow yourself to rest and observe what is surfacing. The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will oﬀer a reset around your sense of belonging, helping you plant seeds for a home life that feels both stable and emotionally nourishing. </p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, this week encourages you to tune into your inner world and the conversations shaping your daily life. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, your sector of home, family, and emotional foundations is activated. </p>



<p>Vesta asks you to reflect on where your emotional energy and sense of devotion are rooted, especially within your living space or family dynamics. This is the ideal week for you to re-organize your home, sage your space, and set necessary boundaries with family members. </p>



<p>As Venus joins forces with Vesta this week, there’s an opportunity for you to soften emotional walls, create more beauty or comfort at home, or have heartfelt conversations that bring healing and understanding. You may feel called to redefine what “home” means to you, both physically and emotionally. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, you’re in the final stretch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Capricorn Season</a>, which has been activating your communication, mindset, and learning sector. Over the past few weeks, you may have been more intentional about your words, boundaries, and the information you engage with. As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, mental fatigue, self-doubt, or emotional heaviness around conversations and decisions can surface. This is a signal to slow your pace and give your mind space to rest. Journal, unplug when possible, and release thought patterns that feel overly critical or restrictive. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will oﬀer a reset around how you communicate and connect, helping you set intentions that support clarity, emotional honesty, and a more grounded inner dialogue. </p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, this week invites you to get clear about what truly holds value in your life. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, your sector of communication, learning, and daily exchanges is activated. Vesta asks you to reflect on how you use your voice, your time, and your attention, especially in conversations, writing, or digital spaces. </p>



<p>As Venus joins Vesta, words carry more warmth and intention, making this a supportive time for meaningful conversations, creative writing, or reconnecting with people who inspire your curiosity. You may feel motivated to share ideas that feel aligned with your values rather than speaking simply to be heard. </p>



<p>At the same time, you’re in the final stretch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Capricorn Season</a>, which has been highlighting your finances, self-worth, and material security. Over the past few weeks, you may have been taking a closer look at how you earn, spend, or define your sense of stability. As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, worries around money or self-esteem can surface, especially if you’ve been pushing yourself to prove your worth. Instead of spiraling, use this moment to rest and reassess. Release financial habits or narratives that feel rooted in fear rather than trust. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th brings an opportunity to reset your relationship with money and self-worth, helping you build a foundation that feels both sustainable and empowering. </p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, this week may feel quietly significant, like something important is settling into place beneath the surface. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, your sector of finances, values, and self-worth is activated. Vesta asks you to reflect on where your energy, time, and resources have been going, and whether those investments truly align with what you value most. </p>



<p>As Venus joins forces with Vesta, conversations around money, boundaries, and worth can soften, making it easier to advocate for yourself or recognize where you deserve more support, compensation, or appreciation. This is a moment to recommit to value systems that honor both your effort and your humanity. </p>



<p>At the same time, you’re in the final stretch of your season, with the sun, Mercury, Venus, and Mars all having moved through Capricorn. This has likely been an intense period of self-definition, responsibility, and growth, asking you to show up with maturity and resilience. As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, self-doubt, exhaustion, or emotional heaviness can surface, especially around identity or expectations you place on yourself. Rather than pushing through, allow yourself to slow down and release old roles or pressures that no longer fit. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will mark a powerful personal reset, inviting you to set intentions for the next chapter of your life, one rooted in authenticity, self-respect, and a vision of success that truly feels like your own. </p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, this week feels like a threshold moment, one where your inner world is preparing you for a visible shift. With Vesta entering your sign on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, the spotlight turns inward, asking you to reflect on what you are devoted to on a soul level. Vesta invites you to reconnect with your sense of purpose, identity, and personal integrity, especially around how you show up in relationships and community spaces. </p>



<p>As Venus joins Vesta, self-worth and self-expression soften and expand. You may feel more comfortable being seen, asking for what you want, or prioritizing pleasure and authenticity without guilt. This is a powerful moment for redefining how you relate to yourself before offering energy to others. </p>



<p>At the same time, you are in the final stretch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Capricorn Season</a>, which has been activating your sector of rest, closure, and subconscious patterns. Over the past few weeks, you may have been processing old emotional cycles, burnout, or the need for solitude more deeply than usual. </p>



<p>As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, fatigue, vivid emotions, or the urge to retreat can intensify. Instead of resisting this inward pull, honor it. Rest, unplug, and release habits or narratives that drain your spirit. The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will offer a quiet but potent reset, helping you clear space internally so you can step into your next personal chapter feeling lighter, more grounded, and aligned. </p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, this week encourages you to listen closely to what is stirring beneath the surface. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, your sector of rest, intuition, and behind-the-scenes healing is activated. Vesta asks you to reflect on where your energy has been quietly devoted, especially in ways that may go unseen by others. </p>



<p>As Venus joins forces with Vesta, there’s an opportunity to soften your relationship with solitude, rest, and emotional processing. You may feel drawn to creative reflection, spiritual practices, or simply giving yourself permission to slow down without guilt. This is a powerful moment to tend to your inner world with care and compassion. </p>



<p>At the same time, you’re in the final stretch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Capricorn Season</a>, which has been emphasizing your friendships, community ties, and long-term aspirations. Over the past few weeks, you may have been reassessing which connections feel supportive and which ones feel draining or misaligned. </p>



<p>As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, feelings of isolation, doubt, or emotional heaviness can surface, especially around belonging or your place within a group. Rather than withdrawing completely, allow yourself to observe what these emotions are revealing. Rest, release outdated expectations, and trust that not every connection needs to come with pressure or obligation. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will provide you with a sense of renewal around community and future goals, helping you plant seeds for relationships and dreams that feel both grounded and genuinely nourishing. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953881.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>As someone who grew up <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/misogyny-towards-fandoms-fangirls"">in fandom,</a> the <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/6-netflix-tv-movies-january"">People We Meet On Vacation</a></em> screenwriter Yulin Kuang knows the importance of a good <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/book-to-tv-movies-adaptations-2026"">book-to-screen adaptation</a> more than most. As a teen, she would journal pages of angst about how upcoming adaptations needed to be faithful, lest they “ruin her whole childhood.” As she’s become more successful in her career as a screenwriter and director (Kuang is currently adapting and directing Emily Henry’s <em>Beach Read</em>), she’s come to realize that the best adaptations can’t be a direct copy of the book. So yes, the <em>People We Meet On Vacation</em> movie is different from Emily Henry’s novel  — in a satisfying way.</p>



<p>“I schemed my way into a position of power and influence over my favourite books so that I could rectify and do justice to all [of them]. And I think early on in my career, I was very fixated on trying to keep things as close to the book as possible,” Kuang tells <em>Refinery29</em>. “But the reality that I’ve kind of learned over the period of time is that you can’t actually just film a novel. They’re very different things. They’re very different mediums. And so to me, the task of the adaptation is not to be 100% faithful to the book.”</p>



<p>This means die-hard book fans won’t see every single scene from the Emily Henry novel play out on screen, but while some have been removed, fresh new scenes have been introduced. Kuang says there are book scenes she would have loved to include, but it’s impossible to fit everything into the script. And even if she writes the scenes, they don’t always make it through the final edit. “They end up on the cutting room floor for whatever reason, and each one of those is a small tragedy for the book purist who resides deep within my heart,” she jokes. “But I think we also brought in a lot of things that I hope people will love too.” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> They’re very different mediums. And so to me, the task of the adaptation is not to be 100% faithful to the book.</p><cite>Yulin Kuang<br />on the <em>People We Meet On Vacation</em> Movie</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>There’s one particular scene near the start of the film which book fans won’t recognize, and it came about after the writers received feedback from Netflix. “I was really excited about that [new scene], because it felt like getting to construct Poppy (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/emily_bader/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Emily Bader</a>) and Alex (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tomblyth/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tom Blyth</a>) fanfic,” she says. “There’s definitely stuff that [book purists will] miss, because I miss it, but there’s also stuff that I hope will bring joy and delight as well.”</p>







<p>Kuang is one of Henry’s close collaborators, and while she can’t tease too much about the upcoming <em>Beach Read</em> movie (they’re currently casting, and she just had a VFX meeting), she says their working relationship was “a dream” from the start. Henry has been generous with her energy, time and thoughts, allowing Kuang to connect with the source material on a deep level. “[She would] provide me with these character maps of the characters that were always very helpful about, what’s driving them? What’s the fear?” she says. “She was so trusting, which I think, looking back now, that was such a gift.”</p>



<p>Kuang is reluctant to confirm whether book purists will embrace <em>People We Meet On Vacation</em>, and quickly knocks on wood. “I hope they do, but you can never be too prescriptive,” she says. “I <em>can </em>say this. This film by everybody, by Emily, by Brett Haley, our director, by me and the other writers, Amos and Nunzio, it was all done with so much love and care and respect for this source material… it has to stand as a work on its own that hopefully feels like a love letter to the book.”</p>



<p><strong>People We Meet On Vacation</strong><em><strong> will be streaming on Netflix starting Friday, January 9.</strong></em></p>
