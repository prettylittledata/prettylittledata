The three principal architects in charge of the design engaged in an interesting ""design dialogue,"" balancing division of labor and collaboration. Given their close relationship, the junior high and primary schools agreed on a coordinated master plan. Both structures adopt a ""sandwich""-like layout. First, the dimensions of the connecting body at critical junctions are strictly controlled. Then, each is free to develop its own expression. The junior high and primary school buildings are divided longitudinally into three functional spaces. Arranged from west to east are auxiliary teaching space, main teaching space, and extracurricular interest space. </p>",

<p>Beit Hawa, is a <strong>residential project</strong> in Uptown Cairo shaped by the ethos of morphosis,  where the interior architecture functions as an adaptive system rather than a static arrangement. The design moves away from rigid modernist typologies, employing fluid spatial sequences that negotiate transitions between private and public zones. Surfaces and volumes are defined through <strong>layered materiality, integrating light, texture, and structural clarity</strong> into a coherent spatial syntax. <strong>Circulation operates as a generative element</strong>, creating smooth shifts that dissolve conventional boundaries between functions. </p>",

<p>KITONOKO is a community-oriented complex located in a suburban commercial district, conceived as a place where architecture quietly connects people, work, and everyday life. Surrounded by large-scale retail and roadside developments, the project seeks to introduce a more human-scaled, open, and approachable environment within a typically car-oriented context. Rather than operating as a closed commercial facility, the building encourages local residents, visitors, and staff to naturally intersect through spatial openness and continuity.</p>",

<p><em>The First Act of Organization: Tracing the Trajectory of Life</em> — The existing three-story building sits on terraced terrain, accessible from both north and south. Years of habit had formed a vertical functional zoning: the second floor, connecting to the vehicular road in the southern community, served as the main entrance, housing the living room, garage, guest room, balcony, and atrium; the first floor, backing against the hillside retaining wall and facing the rear garden, connected to the pedestrian secondary entrance and consisted of the dining room, kitchen, and entertainment room; the third floor was the most private sleeping area, containing two bedrooms and a study. After continuous discussion and comparison of schemes, this zoning was retained in the renovation. The thinking focused on how to release the spatial potential of the house to become a catalyst for the evolution of future life.</p>",

<p>Visits to the site sparked the desire to build a house that would blend into the landscape. We found large rocks on the land, which is protected by dense vegetation, that protruded from the steep slope of the southern portion. There's also a lake nearby, accessible via a short trail through the woods.</p>",

<h4>On self-surveillance, professional performance, and the cost of forgetting that we built the cage.</h4><figure><img alt=""A translucent mask held in hands with a blurred figure in the background, suggesting the separation between performance and identity."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_gP_nYArWNMnQl8l2rAojQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Is this one me? (All conceptual images in this article were generated by the author using AI.)</figcaption></figure><p>As designers, we live performance twice over: as users who perform constantly, and as the creators of the systems that encourage that performance. This article is about the first, but it inevitably speaks to the second.</p><p>I spent forty minutes choosing a profile picture. Forty minutes taking selfies, testing angles, adjusting light, cropping, thinking about how I wanted to be seen. My professional dignity is somehow correlated to how well I can camouflage my aging. For people I’ve never met. Who may never see it.</p><p>While testing angles, I thought: When did this become normal? Then I did something even worse. Or more practical. Or both — I can’t tell the difference anymore.</p><p>I used an AI tool to “enhance” the photo. Adjust the lighting. Add a studio background. Give it that more “professional” look.</p><blockquote>I literally asked an algorithm to tell me what my face should look like.</blockquote><p>And the most depressing part wasn’t doing it. It was that it worked. The photo was “better.” More presentable. More performative.</p><p>I learned this from an influencer with millions of followers. He shows it with data: posts featuring his face generate 40% more engagement. More likes, more comments, more shares. Translation: more visibility, more clients, more revenue. Except you don’t have time to produce 30 different photos a week. So he uses AI to generate headshots of himself in any context. Very practical.</p><p>If you don’t do it, you’re losing reach. If you’re not doing it now, your competitors already are.</p><p>The logic is impeccable.</p><p>And I tested it. Because the data was clear. And anyone who seriously studies metrics has been doing this for months.</p><p>We went from practical to practical. And we distorted ourselves along the way.</p><h3>The promise that worked</h3><p>To be fair: personal branding was born as a promise of freedom.<br />Before, you depended on gatekeepers. Editors deciding whether your writing deserved to exist. HR deciding whether your résumé was “adequate.” Agencies deciding whether you were “relevant enough.” Your competence only mattered if someone with power gave you permission to show it.</p><p>The internet changed that.</p><p>Designers sharing their process on Behance and landing clients on the other side of the world. Writers publishing directly, without a publisher, building real audiences. That brilliant but shy professional who never shone at in-person networking is finally able to let the work speak for itself.<br />And it worked.</p><p>You wouldn’t be reading this if that weren’t true. A substantial part of those without a platform finally gained a voice. Many voices can now be heard, and that is a humanitarian gain. Opportunities that simply wouldn’t have existed 15 years ago became possible.</p><p>Personal branding was empowerment: controlling your own narrative and deciding who you are, instead of accepting the box they put you in.</p><p>But then the market noticed it was working.</p><blockquote>And did what markets do best:<br />systematized, optimized, monetized, and turned it into an obligation.</blockquote><figure><img alt=""Hand adjusting a translucent mask against a soft-focused background, depicting the continuous refinement of professional performance."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PFmLv0kt5vVpF3k0pPh7_A.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Almost natural. Just one more adjustment.</figcaption></figure><h3>When empowerment became compulsory performance</h3><p>“Show your work” became “perform expertise 24/7.”</p><p>“Be authentic” became “authenticity as a brand strategy — here are 10 templates.”</p><p>“Build an audience” became “monetize every second of attention or you’re wasting your potential.”</p><p>And “follow these steps” became the promise that you might finally be seen in an ocean of people competing for attention.</p><p>What was optional became mandatory to survive.</p><p>And again we bought in. Because it works. Those who perform better grow faster. Those who aren’t seen aren’t remembered. Those without a personal brand have no market.</p><p>So you and I performed. And we performed well.</p><h4>We became the product</h4><p>We became a Coca-Cola that needs a logo, a tagline, an editorial calendar, a conversion funnel, alignment with causes, and constant optimization.<br />And now, an increasingly common strategy: turn on the camera. Reels. Stories. Short videos. For some, text is no longer enough. Show your face in motion. Speak directly. Rehearse spontaneity twelve times until it looks natural.</p><p>That uncomfortable task of selling yourself publicly. Of talking alone to a camera. Of feigning naturalness while repeating the same hook three times until it sounds “authentic.”</p><p>The logic is clear: the algorithm prioritizes video, “people trust people.” Showing your face has become synonymous with credibility.</p><p>So they record. Edit. Re-record. Post. And hope those fifteen seconds of filmed discomfort generate the numbers that justify the effort.</p><blockquote>They called it “personal branding.” As if you were a product. We objectified ourselves.</blockquote><p>And what does refusing mean? Becoming invisible in a market where visibility has become a condition of existence.</p><p>We show the quality of our work and what makes us unique — but through so many layers of optimization and strategic performance that the line between substance and packaging begins to disappear. We sell edited versions of ourselves — myself included — for the market to consume.</p><h4>It’s a silent escalation</h4><p>If only this were just a problem of photos.</p><p>It has migrated into everyday communication. That email with eight people copied? You know exactly what happens. Heightened attention. Every word calculated. You’re not writing to communicate — you’re performing competence for an audience you imagine judging every comma.</p><p>And we find ourselves wondering: How will so-and-so read this? What if someone takes it the wrong way? Does this sentence sound confident or arrogant? Is this tone collaborative or passive?</p><p>We edit.</p><p>Re-edit.</p><p>Save the draft.</p><p>Come back.</p><p>Change one word.</p><p>Send.</p><p>And breathe.</p><p>One more theater of efficiency.</p><figure><img alt=""A sharp, in-focus mask in the foreground with a blurred human figure behind it, showing the mask becoming clearer than the person."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aTGFWrN1Hsbecodms47WEg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>I definitely look better this way.</figcaption></figure><h3>The mask that became a face</h3><p>At work, the performance is even more explicit. We have to put on the mask of “I’m the most incredible person you have.” Nothing more than structural survival.</p><p>If you don’t show up, you’re not remembered when promotions come around. Visible performance matters more than silent work. The clarity of your reports ends up defining your perceived reliability.</p><p>So we send weekly reports that are 70% real work, 30% personal marketing. “Key achievements this week,” we write, as if we’d won the space race. That presentation where you rehearsed your “spontaneous contribution” multiple times to impress the people who matter. That calculated moment of waiting a few minutes before responding on Slack, fast enough to seem available, but not so instant that you look desperate or like you have nothing real to do.</p><h4>And it works. Of course it works.</h4><p>Managers love employees who are clear, proactive, communicative. Organizational efficiency improves. Engagement goes up. Everyone wins.</p><p><strong>Does it, though? What’s the cost?</strong></p><p>The cost is invisible but real. Time spent editing messages instead of thinking through the problem that actually needs solving. Mental energy wasted anticipating imaginary judgments. The constant anxiety of being misunderstood or forgotten.</p><p>Professional decisions made based on “what will look good,” until you forget what actually matters.</p><p>Because beneath all this performative efficiency, there’s exhaustion. A permanent sense of inadequacy. You never sent all the updates you should have. Never participated in all the strategic meetings. Never read all the messages or the endless email threads. Never took enough initiative in company-wide meetings. Never had enough visibility to be remembered when the promotion came.</p><p>And the more you try, the more you confirm that <strong>you’re not enough</strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""Two hands pressed against a translucent barrier from inside, palms open, depicting confinement in a self-built prison."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*c0DUYalI8FDA_Lcx8JcVGA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>What was the way out again?</figcaption></figure><h3>Voluntary prisoners</h3><p>We built our own prison. There is no captor. No explicit coercion. But there are invisible bars, internalized, real. Bars made of constant visibility, of public metrics, of social validation as the currency of professional survival.<br />And we built them. Post by post.</p><p>It’s a practical necessity. Your career and market relevance depend on it. You perform without even noticing. Until you lose the ability to distinguish what you want from what you need to demonstrate.</p><p>I say this as someone who has already built a platform. Portfolio, clients, margin. What about those trying to enter? There’s no “before performing.” You start already performing. The prison has floors. Some think about leaving. Others, about getting in. That doesn’t invalidate the critique. It just situates who has the margin to make it.</p><h4>Nothing worse than becoming a voluntary enforcer</h4><p>That colleague who delivers exceptional work but doesn’t post their process? “They need to learn to communicate better.”</p><p>That designer who doesn’t update their portfolio every month?<br />“Doesn’t know how to sell themselves.”</p><p>You’ve internalized the logic so thoroughly that you now police it for free.<br />And when someone criticizes the system, we feel indignation. Almost a personal attack.</p><p>“Well, I grew because of it. You’re being naive; this is just how the world works now.”</p><p>Someone pointed at the prison, and we explained why the bars are necessary.</p><figure><img alt=""A heart shape drawn on a foggy glass barrier with hands visible below, representing affection directed toward one’s own confinement."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mCfzlDWITl7GOUI6JwHReQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Privileged to be here.</figcaption></figure><h3>And we’re still grateful</h3><p>The results are real. That client from networking, that promotion, they happened. Visibility works. For those who need to build material security, this isn’t superficial.</p><p>The problem arises when we lose the ability to distinguish: am I doing this because I chose to, or because I can no longer imagine any other way of existing professionally?</p><p>And when we achieve something?</p><p><strong>Genuine gratitude, or a performance of contentment?</strong></p><p>I don’t even know anymore.</p><p>So we post about gratitude. About the “privilege of doing what you love.” About lessons from the journey. About how our team is “the most incredible family in the world,” how the company culture “transforms lives.”</p><p>#grateful.</p><h4>The moment identity disappears</h4><p>But there comes a moment, sooner or later, when that thought surfaces.<br />“That opinion I posted… do I actually believe it, or was it because it would generate engagement?”</p><p>“That project I chose… did it interest me, or did it just make better content?”</p><p>“That moment of introspection…</p><p>Did I need to think?</p><p>Or was I already performing introspection?”</p><p>And maybe we no longer know. We’ve performed for so long that we don’t know who we’d be without it.</p><figure><img alt=""A blurred interface or document visible through translucent glass with a human figure observing it, symbolizing designers viewing their own creations."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tnPAz5xqu5ndwIUuZIv8Ug.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Ready for personal use.</figcaption></figure><h3>And who designs all this?</h3><p>Us. Designers, UX, product managers.</p><p>I’m not saying we do it in bad faith. Most genuinely believe they’re “improving the experience.” But let’s be honest about what that means:<br />Public validation metrics — views, likes, shares — so you know in real time exactly how well you’re performing.</p><ul><li><strong>The “seen” receipt <br /></strong>It obligates you to respond immediately, or perform an excuse.</li><li><strong>“Typing…”<br /></strong>It makes you rewrite your message knowing they can see you typing.</li><li><strong>Who viewed your profile<br /></strong>Sold as a premium feature. Monetizing paranoia.</li><li><strong>Your profile is 73% complete<br /></strong>Amanufactured sense of being unfinished.</li><li><strong>Seen by 47 people<br /></strong>Paranoia about who saw it and said nothing.</li><li><strong>Active now</strong> <br />Logging in as a public declaration of presence.</li></ul><p>Interfaces designed to manipulate decisions. Features that create behavioral dependency. Architectures that hijack your time.</p><p>All of this has a name. <a href=""https://www.deceptive.design/""><strong>Dark patterns</strong></a>. <strong>Addictive design</strong>. <strong>Attention capture</strong></p><p>Every discomfort you feel was engineered.</p><h4>And it worked. Better than we imagined.</h4><p>We built systems so efficient that they now face litigation. <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2026/01/27/nx-s1-5684196/social-media-kids-addiction-mental-health-trial"">Meta and YouTube for addictive design</a>. <a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/09/ftc-secures-historic-25-billion-settlement-against-amazon"">Amazon fined for impossible cancellation flows</a>. <a href=""https://www.digital-fairness-act.com/"">The European Union classified 97% of the most popular App Store applications as containing dark patterns</a> and began regulating the sector.<br />But when you’re on the product team, the metrics make sense.

Developing tools that don’t just observe your performance — they help you perform better. With data, insights, algorithmic empathy.</p><blockquote>And the worst part: we’ll accept it. Because refusing means falling behind.</blockquote><p>The pieces already exist. <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68067022"">Amazon uses tracking systems — wristbands and scanners that monitor warehouse workers’ productivity every second</a>, generating “idle time” metrics. Microsoft Viva analyzes your communication patterns and productivity. Humanyze monitors tone of voice and body language in interactions. Insurance companies offer discounts in exchange for health data.</p><p>In isolation, each seems reasonable. But when they talk to each other?<br />You stay late working on an urgent proposal. Your laptop logs nighttime productivity. Your smartwatch logs insufficient sleep. Your calendar shows six meetings in one day.</p><p>The system infers: “Problematic time management. Procrastination during working hours. Burnout risk.”</p><p>You probably won’t be consulted. The system will build a behavioral profile you’ve never seen, but that your manager can access. That interface is likely already being built by talented designers and engineers, perhaps even well-intentioned ones, who believe they’re solving real problems.</p><h4>And how will it be sold?</h4><p>“Empowerment through data.”</p><p>“Enhanced self-awareness.”</p><p>“Personalized support.”</p><p>The messaging will be empathetic, careful, almost moving.<br />But you didn’t define what “healthy” looks like. They did. You didn’t choose to be monitored. You just accepted it, because refusing would mean “not caring about your own development.”</p><p>It’s the same logic as the profile picture.</p><p>Every step is perfectly rational. Supremely practical.</p><p><strong>And we keep distorting ourselves.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""A person’s hands held together in contemplation, clearly visible without barriers, suggesting awareness and presence outside of performance."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y5ddbSG-7Q71-zTZ8h_vrA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Here I am.</figcaption></figure><h3>There any redemption?</h3><p>I don’t believe the solution is deleting your account or retreating to the woods. And you probably won’t stop performing — I won’t. The game exists. Refusing to play is a privilege most people don’t have.<br />But there is a difference between performing with the awareness that it’s theater, and believing that the theater is you.</p><p>If you need to edit the photo to get in the game, that’s fine. A diplomat wears a suit, a doctor wears a white coat; you wear a profile picture. We put on masks because the world demands it. This is ritual, contingent on the moment we’re living in. It is neither eternal nor natural.</p><p>The problem was never the mask. It was forgetting you were wearing one.<br />I write this knowing that this very text participates in the same structure, it will be shared, and it will be performed. Awareness of the theater doesn’t take me off the stage. It only reminds me that I’m on it too.</p><p>But what makes us sick is not the performance itself, it’s the sustained lie. The manager who posts about human-centered culture while expecting replies at 11pm. The designer who celebrates inclusivity but never questions the product’s exclusionary metrics. The professional who performs gratitude while feeling nothing but exhaustion.</p><p>Awareness of the theater is what prevents moral dissonance. When you know it’s performance, you preserve mental energy for what truly matters. Your family. Your values. Your actual competence.</p><figure><img alt=""A person with hands in reflective pose, with a blurred screen or interface visible in the background, depicting conscious work and agency."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uAr7q8SqhJ6CiUlqhZZeVA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>What if I changed this?</figcaption></figure><h4>And us, as designers?</h4><p>For us, creators of systems, designers, UX, product managers, there is always a gap.</p><p>A gap between “what the metric demands” and “what I know is right.”</p><p>A gap between “what will perform better in the A/B test” and “what won’t leave the user feeling manipulated afterward.”</p><p>The gap isn’t always navigable. There are moments when the system leaves no room, when the choice is between compromising the design or compromising the paycheck.</p><h4>But the gap exists.</h4><p>And culture is never static. It is always transforming. What holds value today becomes irrelevant tomorrow. What seems inevitable today, five years from now, is embarrassing.</p><p>Remember when smoking on planes was normal? When doctors recommended cigarettes? When asbestos was the “material of the future”? When tobacco advertising sponsored Formula 1? When children’s advertising had no limits? When drunk driving was socially tolerated? When no one wore a seatbelt?</p><p>I know, the damage of the attention economy is different. It’s diffuse, psychological, subjective. You can’t prove in court that the infinite scroll “caused” your anxiety the way cigarettes caused cancer.</p><p>So the change will be slower. More fragmented. It won’t be “we banned dark patterns.” It will be “some companies realize that trust is worth more than engagement, and that becomes a competitive advantage.”</p><p>Change doesn’t come overnight. It comes from accumulated small acts of resistance. From designers who, when they can, choose not to add that manipulative feature. From PMs who advocate for satisfaction metrics, not just time-on-platform. From companies that realize — late, but realize — that trust is worth more than predatory engagement.</p><h4>The market transforms.</h4><p>Fines, lawsuits, and regulations have already begun to appear. Companies are changing because it’s become too costly to stay the same. The market is extremely fluid and hates losing money.</p><h4>Perception transforms.</h4><p>Users already know they’re being manipulated. Teenagers already say “I know this is addictive, but I can’t stop.” Parents are already looking for basic phones for their children. Entire generations growing up distrustful of likes. Books like Jonathan Haidt’s The Anxious Generation and Johann Hari’s Stolen Focus are worldwide bestsellers.</p><p>None of this comes close to solving everything. But it creates space.<br />It creates conditions for products to function without depending on addiction. For professionals to build a presence without constant theatricality. For the process — not just the polished result — to hold recognized value.</p><p>And when designers, creators, and builders of systems begin to see our own complicity, the tools we create begin to change too.</p><p>Because we realize that systems that consume people eventually consume us as well.</p><p>Redemption, if it exists, is not individual. It is not “I saved myself, good luck to the rest.” It is collective, far slower than it should be, and full of setbacks.</p><p>But it is possible.</p><p>Small cracks in the system. Minimal gestures, repeated until they become culture. We stay in the game, but play it a little differently. A little more consciously.</p><p>And when we have the choice, we can choose to lie a little less.</p><p>Maybe it won’t change the world. But it keeps a piece of you intact.</p><p>And that, in itself, is already a beginning.</p><h4>To continue the conversation</h4><p>Thank you for following me through this reflection.

<h4>The future of digital advertising should feel less like a distraction and more like recommendations from a friend.</h4><figure><img alt=""A delicate watercolor and graphite sketch of a smartphone screen showing a chat interface where one specific message bubble is glowing with a warm, golden light, symbolizing a high-utility, relevant answer"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3gimrvTxVY4VhPIvGKaU5A.png"" /><figcaption><em>High relevance ads could enhance the quality of the content.</em></figcaption></figure><p>I’m a <strong>product designer</strong> and for the last four years I have been working in digital advertising for tech. I wouldn’t have imagined building part of my career in advertising, but here I am, and I have found myself honestly enjoying the challenge. Through this experience, I have learned that <strong>healthy and fair advertising</strong> is actually a good thing for the industry. It helps brands reach people, and it helps people find what they are looking for. When ads are well-executed, they are great content. There have been amazing pieces of advertisement across history, and when you pair great ads with great products, magic happens.</p><p>A few days ago, ChatGPT started <a href=""https://openai.com/index/testing-ads-in-chatgpt/"">testing ads</a> within its conversations. The first screenshots show a safe and expected approach: a user starts a conversation around a specific vertical, the model gives a standard AI answer, and then it shows an ad related to the conversation keywords. This replicates the model used in other media platforms by capturing signals and showing inventory that matches them. It’s a safe starting point, but it feels simplistic considering the possibilities of AI. There should be a more sophisticated way to do this. We need a model that treats ads not as an interruption, but as <strong>high-utility content</strong> that actually improves the experience.</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of a ChatGPT interface showing a ‘Potluck power tips’ response followed by a sponsored ad from ‘Heirloom Groceries’ for an Enchilada Kit, featuring price, stock status, and a small product image."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KHxGNphfpnapvof7EIbXog.jpeg"" /><figcaption><em>OpenAI’s initial test displays ads as sponsored links following a conversational response.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The immediate reaction from many is that ads in ChatGPT will harm the user experience. I think that if the strategy is well executed, it could <strong>improve the quality of recommendations</strong>. My rationale is based on the <strong>data source</strong>. When platforms create an ad ecosystem, they have a real incentive to digest merchant catalogs, local service listings, and travel databases. Once this content is set up for advertisers, it can be used to power general responses, too.</p><p>Currently, when you ask ChatGPT about a product or local service, it likely scrapes multiple websites. This doesn’t guarantee the metadata is right or updated. A <strong>direct integration</strong> with a business’s database ensures freshness and reliability. It is the technical difference between scraping a UI and communicating directly through an <strong>API</strong>. I don’t doubt that advertisers, from global retailers to local barber shops, are waiting for the moment they can upload their catalogs and service lists directly to OpenAI. As <a href=""https://www.roidna.com/blog/advertising-in-the-age-of-llms-what-happens-when-ai-becomes-the-ad-platform/"">industry reports from <strong>ROI·DNA</strong></a> suggest we are entering an era where brand-verified catalogs become a fundamental part of the reasoning layer, allowing the model to ground its advice in high-quality, real-time data rather than just scraped noise.</p><p>Think of it this way: if you ask about running shoes today, the model analyzes your context and scrapes the web. It reads reviews and influencer videos, but it is unlikely to find professional, unbiased benchmarking. Most of these sources already have sponsored rankings, so the content is already biased by <strong>SEO games</strong>. The model might show you an organized summary, but it’s coming from already <strong>biased and probably sponsored sources</strong>. The products might also be out of stock or the technical specs might be outdated.</p><p>In a new model, the AI would bypass this noise by directly integrating with <strong>rich catalogs</strong> of shoes, boutique hotels, or specialized medical services. These databases include real-time price, stock, and local availability. When doing research, the model could cross-reference this first-hand data with community reviews or scientific research. This also <strong>levels the playing field</strong>, as smaller, local brands could be part of that same inventory.</p><p>By leaning into this infrastructure now, OpenAI is pulling ahead of most competitors. They are building a better recommendation experience under the guise of an ad network, establishing the <strong>technical pipes required for commerce </strong>before others even begin. <strong>Google</strong> remains a unique incumbent here. Through its shopping features, it has spent years perfecting an ecosystem of real-time merchant data. While Google may be better positioned to activate these features when they decide to fully commit to AI ads, OpenAI’s moves are defining a new standard for what a helpful recommendation engine in the AI world looks like.</p><p>My take on the recent <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De-_wQpKw0s"">Anthropic ad campaign</a>, which brilliantly mocks the scenario where ads become intruders in the conversation, is that while it is a great piece of marketing, it only addresses the “noisy” version of advertising. In a scenario where ads are treated as high-quality, verified content, this satirical picture no longer fits. More importantly, LLMs that fail to integrate these APIs and catalogs soon risk falling behind in the race to provide the best commercial recommendations because that is a primary use case for AI users today.</p><p>I often think of the analogy of a friend recommending a product. If you tell a friend who is passionate about bikes that you’re looking for a weekend ride, they don’t just shout a brand name at you. They ask about your taste, your budget, and your local terrain. They are a friend first, understanding your context before suggesting a solution. This is the difference between <strong>advertising as noise and advertising as advice.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""A minimalist watercolor study of two friends sitting at a cafe table; one is gesturing while a faint, sketched bicycle appears as a shared thought between them."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QNSAdwJd_H2s30QaPRdENg.png"" /><figcaption><em>AI recommendations should feel like a conversation between friends.</em></figcaption></figure><p>This analogy brings us to a <strong>“neutrality paradox.”</strong> A good AI analysis should rank options based on what is actually best for the user, rather than who paid the most. Critics will rightly ask: how can the model remain an unbiased advisor if it’s also the salesperson? To get this right, OpenAI must maintain a <strong>strict wall</strong> between the model’s reasoning and the ad auction. The AI should first determine the ideal solution for the user, and only then see if there is an ad that matches that specific intent. If the best suggestion happens to be sponsored content, everyone wins. If the model starts nudging users toward an ad just to hit a revenue target, the trust is gone.</p><p>For this neutrality to feel real, it has to be visible. This means following the rules of digital advertising, like <strong>clear labeling</strong>. If a recommendation is sponsored, the user should know exactly why it’s there and have the power to opt out or mute specific ads entirely. Trust isn’t built by camouflaging the ads, it’s built by giving the user <strong>visibility and control</strong>.</p><p>This new paradigm also has massive implications for <strong>user agency</strong>. Think of a scenario where, when planning a trip, the model surfaces a tiny local coffee shop that just opened in your destination: a business that otherwise could never afford to compete with big brands for global SEO. Perhaps because the user specifically asked for small local businesses. For this to work, OpenAI has to solve the <strong>“pay to play”</strong> barrier. If only the giants can afford to bid, the user’s preference for local shops becomes a dead end. A fair game requires a model where relevance and values can occasionally outrank a large ad budget.</p><figure><img alt=""A warm, glowing watercolor of a small local coffee shop storefront standing out in vibrant color against a muted, grey-sketched city background."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3ylFl0Cshsq07DBHsYxJFg.png"" /><figcaption><em>Find local businesses that matter to you.</em></figcaption></figure><p>This leads to a shift away from one-way communication. Most ads today are static broadcast. In this new model, an ad becomes a <strong>two-way dialogue</strong>. Instead of a generic banner, the ad can become an interactive experience that answers specific questions about a product’s features. It moves from interruption to <strong>consultation</strong>, surfacing only the parts of a product relevant to your current need. The model becomes more like a great salesperson that answers your questions, one who knows when to say, “I have nothing to offer you right now, but it was great having a conversation with you.”</p><p>This approach also enables better <strong>discovery</strong>. Traditional search is limited by what we know to ask for. In a conversation, an AI can identify a need that the user hasn’t yet put a name to. This is a shift toward a discovery-based experience, similar to what platforms like <strong>Pinterest</strong> have spent years perfecting. As <a href=""https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/ads-candidate-generation-using-behavioral-sequence-modeling-f9077ee1325d"">Pinterest Engineering notes</a>, ads are most effective when they are designed to inspire and connect users with ideas they genuinely love rather than acting as a simple distraction.</p><p>Of course, this level of personalization raises the stakes for privacy. To be the “friend” in the analogy, the AI needs to understand your context deeply, but that data must remain a private secret. The real opportunity is in <strong>zero-knowledge advertising</strong>, where an advertiser knows their ad was shown to the right person, but never knows who that person is or what they said to the AI. The proof of success will be found in ad performance, not data harvesting.</p><p>Ultimately, the success of this shift depends on one thing: OpenAI’s willingness to be rigorous enough to <strong>decide when not to show an ad</strong>. The business hunger for growth often leads platforms to flood every empty space with sponsored content. If OpenAI shows an ad just to collect the incentive, even when it doesn’t truly help the user, they become just another search engine. If they make it right, they can leverage the power of the ads as content.</p><p>There are broader challenges in the AI landscape that need to be addressed. Like any powerful technology, AI must be governed by priorities like safety and ethics. <strong>Safety concerns must always come first.</strong> It is only when all necessary guardrails are met, and the model identifies a clear and safe shopping intent, that a healthy advertisement ecosystem can exist.</p><p>This new paradigm opens a significant opportunity for ads to evolve from a <strong>tax on our attention</strong> into a <strong>service for our needs</strong>. A well-executed advertisement could be a win for everyone involved. We’re jumping into the <strong>next phase of human history</strong>, and yes, there will be ads. I don’t think anything will stop this change, so the best thing we can do is get it right by ensuring the value of the answer is never traded for the price of the ad. That’s what I’m hoping to happen.</p><p><strong><em>Rodrigo Osornio</em></strong><em> is a San Francisco-based product designer with training in visual arts and industrial design.

<figure><img alt=""A glasses with floating UI on it. AI-Generated image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RDWf03gEFMyyNtIVGJpa2g.jpeg"" /><figcaption>AI-generated image based on the original from this article <a href=""https://www.queppelin.com/ar-glasses-for-navigation/"">https://www.queppelin.com/ar-glasses-for-navigation/</a></figcaption></figure><p>When I talk about AR glasses, I don’t mean bulky headsets. I mean devices that look like regular eyewear capable of whispering information into your ear and displaying 3D content or flat panels overlaid on the real world.</p><p>This article is neither a validation of the technology nor a criticism, it is an objective personal look at what I see coming. Here are five reasons why I believe AR glasses will succeed and become mainstream, along with the consequences designers and users must face.</p><h3>1. Solving the “Kidnapped Body” problem</h3><figure><img alt=""An illustration of a woman looking at the phone. AI-Generated image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Kv1QO5wUplFqomrm1QmdGg.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Mobile devices demand a high physical price. They force us to look down, occupy our hands, and monopolize our attention. I call this the “kidnapped body” problem. We pay this price without thinking, but the implications are profound. It severs us from the physical world, blocking out views, people, and genuine connection.</p><p>We have even developed medical terms for this. “<a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11856789/"">Tech Neck</a>” describes the repetitive stress injury caused by constantly looking down at a screen. AR glasses may succeed because they liberate the body. They return our hands to us and, more importantly, they lift our chins. By allowing us to look up and ahead, they reintegrate us into the world. While they will for sure introduce new distractions, the shift from “head-down” to “heads-up” computing is a fundamental ergonomic correction that users will gravitate toward.</p><h3>2. The new, no-new device</h3><figure><img alt=""A woman smiling grabbing her glasses. AI-Generated image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zGXPyqrNH8iLmzgZrqIbKw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>In a gadget-saturated world, introducing a completely new device is risky. However, AR glasses have a secret weapon. They aren’t “new.” They are just glasses.</p><p>Global estimates suggest around <a href=""https://www.overnightglasses.com/eyewear-industry-statistics/#:~:text=Globally%2C%20at%20least%202.2%20billion,for%202023%20was%20$65.6%20billion."">4 billion people already wear glasses</a> for various reasons, with over <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/blindness-and-visual-impairment"">2.2 billion people having a near or distance vision impairment</a> according to the World Health Organization. The form factor is familiar, socially accepted, and worn daily. The friction to adoption is incredibly low compared to a VR headset. Much like the Apple Watch which sold 12 million units in its breakout year by leveraging the centuries-old habit of wearing wristwatches. As long as they look like iconic eyewear rather than tech hardware, they are primed for mass adoption.</p><h3>3. The Spatial Canvas (Escaping the Screen)</h3><figure><img alt=""An illustration of a busy street seen from the perspective of a person with AR glasses. The street is full of floating user interface. AI-Generated image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*a-BfGo5NIZp_uzQbQHmxCg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>AI-generated image based on the original from this article <a href=""https://www.crunchfish.com/how-does-the-world-look-through-smart-glasses/"">https://www.crunchfish.com/how-does-the-world-look-through-smart-glasses/</a></figcaption></figure><p>There is a multi-million-dollar industry currently trapped behind 6-inch glass rectangles. Tech giants from phone manufacturers to app developers are hitting the limits of what can be done on a 2D flat screen.</p><p>The physical world is a “green field” for these companies, a massive, unclaimed canvas for digital overlay. Whether we like it or not, the push to colonize our surroundings with digital content is the next logical growth engine for the tech sector.</p><p>For product designers, this represents the most significant paradigm shift ever seen. We are moving from designing within a constrained frame to designing without borders. Eventually, we will no longer design apps that “trap” users, we will design apps that enhance the environment. This shift to “Spatial Computing” will unlock entirely new economies and user behaviors that flat screens simply cannot support.</p><h3>4. Use Cases</h3><figure><img alt=""A floating user interface seen from inside a car. AI-Generated image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dDpTz4QCVcDT2OR8tmirpA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>AI-generated image based on the original from this article <a href=""https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/envisics-ar-windshield-technology/"">https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/envisics-ar-windshield-technology/</a></figcaption></figure><p>The utility of placing digital objects into the physical world is undeniable. While current iterations act as a Heads-Up Display (HUD) rather than fully immersive AR, they are the necessary bridge to the future.</p><p>Apps designed for physical interaction will thrive first:</p><ul><li><strong>Exploration and Learning:</strong> This is perhaps the strongest long-term use case. You could stand in front of a historical monument and instantly see contextual history overlaid on the stone. You could look at a complex car engine and see step-by-step repair labels pointing to the exact parts you need to touch. It turns the entire world into an interactive learning manual.</li><li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Arrows overlaid on the street as you walk, allowing you to converse with friends without checking a phone map.</li><li><strong>Cooking:</strong> Hands-free recipes floating above the counter.</li><li><strong>Safety:</strong> The ability to livestream to emergency services instantly during dangerous situations could be a significant deterrent to crime.</li><li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> For users with disabilities, these glasses can provide real-time context, enhance visual contrast, or narrate the environment instantly empowering users without requiring active intervention.</li></ul><p>As product designers we can already start exploring how to design for AR glasses in Google’s documentation for instance, in this <a href=""https://design.google/library/transparent-screens"">article</a>, David Allan Reese talks about how to design with daylight, UI components sizes, contrast, space awareness and more. You can also take a look at how Google’s AR UI kit, <a href=""https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/jetpack-xr-sdk/jetpack-compose-glimmer"">Jetpack Compose Glimmer</a>, looks like. On the other hand, Meta has also released its <a href=""https://wearables.developer.meta.com/docs/develop"">documentation </a>about developing and designing for Ray-Ban Meta Glasses.</p><h3>5. The Renaissance of Voice</h3><figure><img alt=""An illustration of a woman with an AR glasses touching the right side of them simulating touching the volume. Some sound player UI floating next to the hand. AI-Generated image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mEhRbXCbvv-XrjkMYjF2kg.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Historically, conversational interfaces have suffered from poor reputations. They were often frustrating and limited. However, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has fundamentally changed this.</p><p>Conversational AI is becoming natural, instant, and context-aware very fast. When you combine competent AI with the “hands-free” nature of glasses, voice becomes a crucial input system. The social awkwardness of talking to a device will likely fade, much like how wearing wireless earbuds 24/7 went from “rude” to “normal.”</p><h3>The Consequences</h3><p>If this technology succeeds, we must be prepared for two major friction points, particularly from a design perspective:</p><p><strong>1. The Privacy Paradox</strong> Privacy concerns run in two directions. First, what are manufacturers capturing about our daily lives? Second, how do we manage peer-to-peer privacy? The “always-on” camera creates uneasiness in social settings. How will society regulate recording in public? Will hacking the “recording LED” become common? These social contracts will need to be rewritten, and many users may reject the tech simply to opt out of this surveillance state.</p><p><strong>2. Spatial Invasion and New UX Patterns</strong> If the world becomes a digital canvas, who owns the rights to that space? We risk a future of “spatial spam” ads anchored to physical storefronts, landmarks, or even sidewalks. Without strict regulation, the tranquility of the real world could be interrupted by pop-ups and notifications that we cannot swipe away.</p><p>For designers, this raises critical ethical questions. What is the “dark pattern” of spatial reality? How do we design an “opt-out” mechanism for the real world? We will likely see the rise of aggressive attention-grabbing patterns that physically block your view until acknowledged. Designers will have the heavy responsibility of defining the etiquette of this new layer. Will we design respectful interfaces that blend in, or intrusive billboards that demand attention? We may not see the regulations put in place until after the intrusion has already begun.</p><h3>To wrap up</h3><p>AR glasses introduce a new reality literally, bringing with them as many opportunities as there are threads of concern. For product designers, the challenge is not just to be ahead of the trend, but to deeply understand what this technology adds to or subtracts from human life.</p><p>Personally, I am fascinated by a future enhanced by this technology, a life where reality is augmented to help and delight us. However, I remain cautious. We have seen how initial excitement can turn into unforeseen consequences. Social media reminds us of how a tool for connection can evolve into a mental health crisis.

<h4>AI doesn’t just reflect human bias. It amplifies it through everyday use, quietly shaping judgement, trust, and decisions.</h4><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a person from behind, holding a pen thoughtfully while reviewing two stacks of CVs on a wooden desk. One stack is labelled “AI” and the other “Colleague.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tIC7DvEr9qL6ZqaiHrcYcw.png"" /><figcaption>Image generated by author</figcaption></figure><p>You’re halfway through a stack of job applications, AI assistant humming along beside you, flagging promising candidates like an eager intern. It disagrees with your gut feeling about one applicant. You pause. Reconsider. A few screens later, it disagrees again. You change your mind once more. By the end of the session, you’ve deferred to its judgment on nearly a third of the decisions where you initially felt confident.</p><p>Now swap the algorithm for a colleague. Same stack, same disagreements. How often do you actually budge? Much less often, as it turns out.</p><p>This isn’t hypothetical hand-wringing. <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-02077-2"">Recent research</a> involving 1,401 participants found that <strong>when people disagree with AI, they change their minds 32% of the time. With other humans, that figure drops to 11%.</strong> That’s almost three times more influence from a machine than from another person. Quite something, given we’ve spent millennia learning to be sceptical of each other.</p><p>We like to think of ourselves as rational decision-makers who simply use these tools as helpful aids. The evidence tells a different story. They do more than support our thinking; they reshape it. And far more powerfully than human opinions ever could.</p><p>This raises a question that should keep designers up at night: if users are this susceptible to algorithmic persuasion, what happens when the model itself is biased?</p><p>The answer isn’t just that users make biased choices. The effect compounds. Through repeated interactions, small errors snowball into meaningful distortions. And in most cases, users never notice it happening.</p><figure><img alt=""An infographic showing two stacks of CVs: a tall stack labelled “AI Recommended” and a shorter stack labelled “Your Gut Feeling.” An arrow shows 32% of decisions shifting toward the AI pile.

The problem isn’t one-sided. It’s a two-way street, with both the AI and the human feeding into a loop that amplifies bias at every turn.</p><p>On the AI side, these systems don’t simply reflect the patterns in their training data. They tend to exaggerate them. Machine learning models are optimised to detect and reinforce patterns, which means subtle skews in the data often become stronger in the output.</p><p>A hiring algorithm trained on historical data where 70% of successful hires were men doesn’t just reproduce that 70/30 split. It learns to weight male candidates more heavily, nudging the bias further along. The system is simply doing what it was built to do: find patterns and double down on them.</p><p>But that’s only half of the picture.</p><h3>The human half of the equation</h3><p>We don’t treat AI recommendations the same way we treat advice from another person. We tend to see automated systems as more objective, more analytical. Somehow immune to the messy biases that plague human thinking. This perception gets reinforced by how AI is marketed (“trained on the sum of human knowledge”) and by our long-standing trust in technology for high-stakes decisions in healthcare and finance.</p><p><a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-02077-2"">Research from University College London and MIT</a> shows just how potent this combination can be. Across a series of experiments, participants interpreted facial expressions, motion perception, and other people’s performance. In each case, they interacted with AI systems that had been deliberately programmed with biases similar to those found in many real-world models.</p><p><strong>What happened next wasn’t just a momentary nudge.</strong> The distortion deepened. Through repeated interaction, small initial errors grew into significant skews. Participants who started with relatively minor biases ended up with significantly stronger ones. Largely because the AI amplified existing patterns while participants remained unusually receptive to its guidance.</p><p>Here’s where it gets uncomfortable: most participants had no idea how much the AI was shaping their judgement. When researchers told participants they were interacting with another person (while secretly using a machine), the effect weakened. Simply believing the source was human reduced how deeply the bias took hold.</p><figure><img alt=""Three-phase diagram showing bias persistence. Phase 1: Human and AI robot making decisions together, producing a skewed pattern of outputs. Phase 2: AI is removed, human continues working alone. Phase 3: Human alone still making the same skewed decisions, with a “bias stuck” label and a broken gear icon indicating the pattern has transferred to the human even without the AI present."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*I7183KuMBJ1-HEdXNNmGnQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p>Awareness mattered, but not in the way we might expect. Knowing that the advice came from an algorithm made people <em>more</em> susceptible, not less. <strong>We expect AI to be right, so we lower our guard.</strong> It’s the automation equivalent of assuming the smoke alarm would have gone off if there were a real fire.</p><p>Even more troubling: this effect doesn’t vanish when the AI does. <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-42384-8"">A 2023 study</a> had participants assess medical images (specifically, deciding whether skin spots were benign or potentially cancerous) using a deliberately biased algorithm.</p><p>When the system was removed, the bias stuck around. People continued making the same skewed calls on their own, having unconsciously absorbed its patterns into their decision-making. The higher someone’s self-reported trust in automation, the more their independent conclusions mimicked the machine’s errors.</p><h3>The path of least resistance</h3><p>Our vulnerability to AI isn’t just about trust in technology. It’s rooted in something rather unflattering about how our brains handle effort.</p><p><strong>Psychologists call this the <em>cognitive miser</em> effect. </strong>Thinking is expensive (metabolically, emotionally, and in terms of time) so when we’re handed an opportunity to reduce mental effort, we tend to grab it. These systems offer a particularly seductive shortcut: offloading complex judgement to something that appears faster, smarter, and more thorough than we could manage ourselves.</p><p>This helps explain why automation bias shows up so consistently. <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3240751/"">Studies show</a> that when people work with automated decision-support systems, they dial back their own monitoring and verification. <strong>The presence of AI doesn’t just influence decisions; it quietly changes how much effort we put into thinking at all.</strong></p><p>We see the recommendation, and it feels complete. The work appears to be done. On to the next thing.</p><figure><img alt=""Split illustration comparing cognitive load. Left side labelled “Without AI: High Cognitive Load” shows an overheating brain filled with gears, surrounded by data, documents, and question marks. Right side labelled “With AI: Reduced Cognitive Effort” shows a calm, glowing brain with a “Recommendation Accepted” checkmark and a small robot below."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YdaGvpezSIlnOGjNRow9JQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p>But this isn’t purely about conserving effort. We also tend to believe that these tools have analytical abilities that surpass our own. In some domains, that belief is justified. They can crunch enormous datasets, spot patterns at scale, and perform calculations far beyond human capability.</p><p>The problem is that we extend this assumption into contexts where it doesn’t hold.</p><p>The fact that an algorithm can analyse thousands of medical images doesn’t mean its assessment about an individual patient is infallible. Just because a system can process every CV in a database doesn’t mean it grasps what makes a good hire in a specific team. The leap from “impressive at scale” to “trustworthy in specifics” is one we make far too readily.</p><h3>When trust spirals</h3><p><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3240751/"">The evidence on automation bias</a> shows that inexperience and low confidence amplify this effect. When people feel uncertain about their own abilities, or when they’re working under time pressure, they’re more likely to defer to the machine.</p><p>This creates a rather unhelpful loop. <strong>The more we rely on AI, the less we exercise our own judgement. The less confident we become, the more we rely on it.</strong> Keep that cycle spinning long enough, and your decision-making instincts start to gather dust.</p><p>Branding matters too. Studies have found that when users are told they’re working with an “expert system” rather than a basic algorithm, they’re more likely to follow its recommendations — even when those recommendations are wrong. How we label AI directly shapes how much trust users place in it.</p><p>There’s also what researchers call <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation_bias"">“learned carelessness”</a>. When these systems perform well over time, users gradually reduce their vigilance. High reliability leads to complacency. If the system has been right 95% of the time, we stop checking as carefully. And when it stumbles on that remaining 5%, we’re rarely prepared.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram of a downward spiral with four stages: “Defer to AI” at the top, followed by “Practice Own Judgement Less”, then “Confidence in Own Ability Drops”, and finally “Defer to AI Even More.” The spiral tightens and darkens as it descends into a vortex."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dUJ8BO0UjkYFStYuUgdqOA.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><h3>More than the sum of its parts</h3><p>For a long time, AI bias and human bias have been treated as separate problems with separate fixes. We try to clean up training data and fine-tune models. We train users to recognise their own blind spots and think more critically. Both approaches matter, but they miss something essential. What emerges from human–AI interaction isn’t simply one plus the other. It’s compound bias. Something new that arises specifically from the interplay between the two.</p><p>Think of it less like an equation and more like a chemical reaction. When certain elements combine, they don’t just sit alongside one another. They interact, producing something neither had before they met.</p><p><a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2504.18759v1"">A recent paper</a> makes exactly this argument. <strong>Bias doesn’t live solely in the model or in the user. It emerges dynamically through feedback loops that evolve over time, each party making the other a little worse with every exchange.</strong></p><p>Medical AI studies illustrate this clearly. In a <a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2511.14591v2"">2025 study</a>, researchers examined what happens when class imbalance in AI systems meets human base rate neglect.</p><p>Class imbalance is a technical bias where rare conditions are underrepresented in training data. Base rate neglect is a human cognitive bias where we struggle to reason accurately about low-probability events. Individually, each causes predictable problems.</p><p>Together, they produce something worse.</p><p><strong>Class imbalance throws off people’s ability to gauge how much they should trust the AI. Base rate neglect makes users more vulnerable to skewed outputs.</strong> Each bias reinforces the other, creating feedback loops that lead to poorer outcomes than either would cause alone.</p><p>The errors don’t add up. They multiply.</p><h3>Fixing the wrong problem</h3><p>This is why traditional debiasing strategies often fall short. You can scrub training data and tune algorithms all you like. But if the interaction pattern itself amplifies bias, you haven’t solved the problem. You’ve just trimmed one input to a system that compounds errors regardless.</p><p>The same goes for human-focused interventions. <strong>Teaching users about cognitive bias is valuable, but if the interface encourages offloading and discourages verification, that knowledge stays theoretical.</strong> Filed under “good to know” and rarely retrieved.</p><p>The question shifts. It’s not “is the AI biased?” Or even “are the users biased?” Instead, it goes: “does this interaction create bias amplification over time?”</p><p>That’s a fundamentally different design challenge.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WTzPaQG-Fs7yjFKMekYRLg.png"" /><figcaption>Image based on Caravaggio’s Narcissus (1597–1599)</figcaption></figure><h3>Mirror, mirror in the interface</h3><p>AI doesn’t just mirror our biases. It amplifies them. Quietly, incrementally, and often invisibly. The problem isn’t confined to training data or human psychology alone. It lives in the space between humans and machines, shaped by how each influences the other over repeated interaction.</p><p>For designers, this reframes what we’re solving for. We can’t simply debias algorithms and dust off our hands. We can’t rely solely on user education. <strong>The bias emerges from the interaction itself. From patterns of trust, deference, and cognitive offloading that compound with every exchange.</strong></p><p>Which brings us to the real question.</p><p>If this amplification happens through everyday interactions with AI, where is it already showing up most strongly in the products we use today?</p><p>The research points to a particular type of interface. One that feels natural, helpful, and conversational. In these interactions, users don’t just follow biased recommendations. They begin to internalise them, carrying those biases forward even after the interaction ends.</p><p>And that’s precisely what makes it so hard to see.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Thanks for reading! 📖</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote><em>If you liked this post, </em><a href=""https://medium.com/@doracee""><em>follow me on Medium</em></a><em> for more.</em></blockquote><h3>References &amp; Credits</h3><p>Glickman, M., &amp; Sharot, T.

<p>Exploring navigation as something bigger than moving through physical and digital spaces — as a fundamental cognitive act</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*X6jNJk6M9uS348ftxZqXGQ.png"" /><figcaption>Shipping the package that’s yourself (Image generated using Procreate and Nanobanana)</figcaption></figure><p>A few weeks ago, I read an article — <a href=""https://www.doc.cc/articles/ai-navigation"">A new navigation paradigm</a> — that felt relatable, yet unsettling in a way I couldn’t fully articulate. I eventually stopped thinking about it, but the ideas lingered in the background. They then surfaced in the most mundane and seemingly unrelated places.</p><p>A few weeks later, as I struggled to submit a loan application online, I realized that my frustration stemmed from more than a technical problem. I had lost the ability to <em>navigate </em>the system.</p><p>Shortly after, while taking an Uber ride to a friend’s place, I caught myself in a moment of reflection. I was moving in the physical space with no attention to my surroundings, completely at the mercy of the driver, who was in turn following the instructions from his phone.</p><p>The kind of navigation I was doing in an Uber didn’t seem all that different from my attempts to navigate the banking system. Navigation suddenly felt bigger — like a fundamental cognitive act.</p><p>In this essay, I examine <strong>navigation in four different realms: institutional, physical, digital, and semantic</strong>. By exploring the commonalities, I hope to convey what’s at stake when we eliminate the <em>friction</em> of navigation, and how to deliberately regain some of it.</p><h3>Navigating the system</h3><p>I am currently attempting to fund a home loan through a major Indian bank that is committed to the idea of a “digital-first” India. As a sign of this commitment, they are now “digital-only” — they now process home loan applications online exclusively, or so I’m told. But the portal is a never-ending obstacle course, almost as if designed to test the user’s patience and persistence. It succeeds phenomenally.</p><p>I’m prompted for identification proofs as PDFs under 1MB or JPEGs under 5MB, but when I provide them, I get an error: <em>“Oops! Something went wrong.”</em> Of course, many things could go wrong. Underneath the digital interfaces is the cross-continent network that makes them all tick — the hundreds of hardware devices the data has to traverse, the tens of thousands of miles of wire crossing land and oceans. Distributed systems are built assuming ephemeral failures. But when they happen consistently, it signals something systemic.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*caGp-0y1osvEHv4av2lxqg.png"" /><figcaption>“Oops! Something went wrong.” Error while submitting documents on a banking portal</figcaption></figure><p>You know the problem is prevalent when it becomes material for comedy. Biswas Kalyan Rath, an Indian stand-up comedian, <a href=""https://youtu.be/PK_zuAuI9x0?si=szB908spPScog_k6&amp;t=64"">has a good bit about the state of “digital-first” marriage registration in India</a>.</p><blockquote>“Marriage, no problem. Very simple. Getting marriage registered.. Big problem. It was always a problem, now there is the illusion of Digital India. There is a website. You can go and register. No problem. Fill the entire form. The “Submit” button does not work.”</blockquote><p>I cracked up when I watched it. I’m not laughing now. I’m three weeks into the loan application, and I need it approved.</p><p>The deeper problem isn’t the bad website. It’s what it does to its users. I understand technology, but the bank’s application is a black box to me. The loan agent is an expert in the process but has proven useless. He’s as much a spectator in this as I am. I’m not merely dependent on the website; I’m trapped between technology that’s not done well and a human who doesn’t understand it well. We’ve both lost the ability to <em>navigate</em> the system.</p><h3>Navigating the physical world</h3><p>During my childhood, when I traveled by bus to my maternal hometown — Ichalkaranji, Maharashtra’s textile hub — we could tell we had arrived by the pungent smell and rhythmic din of the cotton mills. We could tell the time remaining by the landmarks we passed — the restaurants, the trees, the market, the temples, the stadium. Knowing a destination meant knowing its spatial signature. We had to read the surroundings to know when we had arrived. Navigation was an act of observation. Even the act of describing a destination meant being deeply aware of its characteristics. We saw a place as a point in space, situated relative to other places.</p><p>Then came paper maps, which provided a way to abstract the physical reality and capture its essence in symbols. It was a leap forward, but still required us to compare the map against the territory — active interpretation. The map acted as external memory. The processing still happened in your brain. In software terms, this was the separation of storage and compute. The maps only told you the layout. You had to orient yourself against it.</p><p>Then Google Maps outsourced “compute” too.</p><p>It wasn’t just paper maps on a screen. It offered a fundamentally different technology: <em>active navigation</em>. Active interpretation on the user’s part gave way to the step-by-step guidance from the software. It not only knew the landscape; it knew your place in it. You just had to trust it. Spatial navigation became a skill you no longer needed. When Google Maps tells me to “take the next exit and stay on the second to the right lane”, I mindlessly execute.</p><p>What navigation demands from me now is not intelligence but compliance.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2hg4yjIZHevidm3IrPtAhw.png"" /><figcaption>Navigating by compliance (Image generated using Procreate and Nanobanana)</figcaption></figure><p>I’m as much a victim as a culprit of this de-skilling that has happened at scale. Due to my overreliance on technology, I don’t remember the street names in my neighborhood anymore, despite having lived in the same place for over two years. It speaks to how little I pay attention to the world around me when the blue arrow and the friendly voice are leading the way.</p><p><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7156656/"">A 2020 longitudinal study</a> tracked regular drivers over three years and found that people with greater lifetime GPS experience demonstrated reduced spatial memory during self-guided navigation. It found not just correlation, but causality of GPS use leading to decline in spatial memory.</p><h3>Getting carried away</h3><p>Compare this to the Uber model.</p><p>You set the destination, a driver accepts, you accept, and off you go. One of the “benefits” of Uber is that it relieves you of the mundane act of driving. Your attentional resources, the logic goes, can be better spent on “more important” needs — like scrolling social media on your phone instead of greeting the human three feet away. Thanks to self-driving cars, we’ve even eliminated that guilt, if there ever was.</p><p>Somewhere in that scroll, you lose track of time, of the route, of your environment. You’re physically there, but mentally elsewhere. The only active role you’ve played is scheduling the pick-up and the drop-off. You’ve shipped the package that is yourself.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*k0y481sV4ABUh7-lWm-1RA.png"" /><figcaption>Uber pickup and drop-off</figcaption></figure><h3>Navigating the digital world</h3><p>Consider a typical day using digital interfaces. You log in to your computer or your phone, you find the application you need, navigate through its menus and screens, do what you want to do, close it, move on to the next app. It’s essentially an endless loop of navigation until you log off and go back to the real world.</p><p>This is akin to navigation in the pre-GPS world. There is a certain map of the world — the software’s user interface — and you have to learn it. You “onboard” yourself, and navigate it by paying attention. You are spatially aware of the world that the software has created for you. You know what capabilities it has, or where and how to find them.</p><p>We are increasingly moving towards an intent-based navigation system, or as I think of it, “Uber-ification” of the digital world. Intent-based software comes in two flavors: search-first, and AI-first.</p><p>In search-first applications, you search for keywords, say, “expense report” and it’ll show you potential actions like “View your expense reports” or “File a new expense report”. You select the one you want without knowing where it lives in the application. The geography doesn’t matter.</p><p>In AI-first applications, it’s even more extreme. You declare the intent — “File my expenses” — and the agent handles the rest. You’ve achieved your goal without ever knowing where the expense module is housed in the software, or even how to even file one yourself.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/727/1*Z3AwXnIZWn1Ceh_Qq9795Q.png"" /><figcaption>Intent-driven: Search-first</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/743/1*0Z9bFsL-7NjcpvzCWKIg1Q.png"" /><figcaption>Intent-driven: AI-first</figcaption></figure><p>There’s a plethora of intent-based software now, with AI embedded in them, eager to translate your intent into outcomes.

You <strong>assess</strong> your current location, <strong>identify</strong> your destination, <strong>survey</strong> available information — landmarks, street signs, smell, sounds, <strong>hypothesize</strong> about which direction to go, <strong>make decisions</strong> with incomplete information, <strong>monitor</strong> feedback as you move, <strong>adjust</strong>, when you encounter obstacles, wrong turns, or dead ends, and <strong>learn</strong> from the experience, building a richer understanding of the territory.</p><p>Now consider what you do when you’re trying to understand a topic, say, climate change. You <strong>assess</strong> what you currently know or understand, <strong>identify</strong> what you need to know, <strong>survey</strong> available information — documentation, courses, articles, real world case-studies, papers, mental models, <strong>hypothesize</strong> about how it might work, <strong>make decisions</strong> about which path to explore first with incomplete information, <strong>monitor</strong> feedback as you learn, <strong>adjust</strong> your mental model when you hit obstacles, and <strong>learn</strong>, building a richer, more accurate understanding of the system.</p><p>Problem-solving is navigation. Learning is navigation. Decision-making is navigation. You’re moving through space — either real or conceptual — through uncertainty, towards clarity, understanding, destination, or outcomes.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*d711JP8zbOaFo9j4j8lQUQ.png"" /><figcaption>Navigating to clarity (Image generated using Procreate and Nanobanana)</figcaption></figure><p>This isn’t a metaphor. <a href=""https://iiif.library.cmu.edu/file/Simon_box00065_fld05031_bdl0001_doc0001/Simon_box00065_fld05031_bdl0001_doc0001.pdf"">Herbert Simon’s work</a> describes problem-solving as “search through a problem-space.” <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5248972/"">Neuroscience has also shown that the same neural systems(the hippocampus, place, and grid cells)</a> support both physical and conceptual navigation. What makes something navigation isn’t whether it moves through a physical space, but rather that it requires relational mapping, position assessment, route planning, and dynamic reorganization.</p><p>So we are navigating pretty much all the time. And it’s becoming easier with technology. So what?</p><p>Just as GPS use causes a measurable decline in our spatial memory, AI tools that navigate conceptual spaces for us pose the same risk in a different, arguably more critical, domain.</p><h3>The Pharmakon and the problem with frictionless</h3><p>Looking at technological innovations through the lens of <a href=""https://aeon.co/essays/bernard-stieglers-philosophy-on-how-technology-shapes-our-world""><em>pharmakon</em></a> — both remedy and poison — remedies are clearly visible: speed, efficiency, productivity, convenience. Even when they’re not, organizations are happy to sell us on them.</p><p>The poisons are more subtle: dependency, agency, losing the cognitive friction that maintains our capacity to navigate. The agent absorbs the cost of navigation, but it also becomes the locus of agency.</p><p>Two risks that stand out, and are worth thinking about:</p><p><strong>The transfer of agency</strong>: By shifting the agency of navigation to the software, you end up being at the mercy of the navigator. <a href=""https://outofdesk.blog/performance-reviews-llms"">If the AI routes you, you stop thinking about alternatives.</a> The convenience is paid for with a little bit of your money and a lot more of your agency. With the erasure of navigation, Information Architecture gives way to Choice Architecture.</p><p>This might be fine for filing tax returns. Humanity would benefit from spending less time doing that. But what happens when the same happens with critical thinking? Comprehension? Reflection? Decision-making?</p><p><strong>The vacuum of attention</strong>: With the time and attention you’ve regained from not navigating, you need something meaningful to do. Few people know what to do with that kind of freedom. They look to technology to fill the void. But the incentives of technology companies, more often than not, don’t align with the well-being of the user, especially when the way to make money and user interests are at odds.</p><p>When you’re not navigating and also not driving, there’s the promise of reflecting, reading, thinking, writing, or building. But first, why not catch up on what your friends are doing? Or the Kardashians? Or millions of strangers?</p><p>It presents a dark irony: We save time by delegating things to technology, only to pour that time back into it, mindlessly scrolling.</p><h3>Solutions: For victims and culprits</h3><p>I want to think about solutions to this problem, both as a victim — a consumer and a <em>navigator</em> — and a culprit — someone who builds technology products, and <em>designs </em>navigation.</p><p>I say culprits not because they have bad intentions, but likely because they either lack any or they are acting on misaligned incentives.</p><h3>Micro-frictions as the antidote for the victim</h3><p>I’m learning to be more intentional about what friction I want to eliminate and what I want to preserve. About what navigation I want to do myself versus delegate.</p><p>I use AI every day. It has largely empowered me. But I’m deliberate in its use.</p><p>I resist the temptation to start with AI-generated drafts because the value of writing lies in the struggle to articulate the original thought. It’s that struggle that clarifies what you want to say, what you want to achieve. Only then do I use AI. My process isn’t simply sequential, so the handoff isn’t a clear line. It’s a feedback loop. But the bulk of my effort goes into the pre-AI phase, ensuring that I build a vision for the artifact that I want to produce — whether it’s an essay or software. I can then direct it rather than being led by it.</p><p>For places I visit regularly, I’ve stopped using maps. I’m rebuilding the habit of paying attention to my surroundings.</p><p>I keep my phone away when I’m with my kids, both to be present with them and implicitly teach them the value of paying attention. I find pockets of time severed from technology — sipping coffee, going on walks — which builds the habit of being comfortable alone with my thoughts.</p><p>How is this all related to navigation, you say? Intentionality brings clarity, which in turn helps you navigate effectively.</p><p>If you want to read more about this idea of introducing friction, this article from The Cut captures it well: <a href=""https://www.thecut.com/article/brooding-friction-maxxing-new-years-2026-resolution.html""><em>In 2026, We Are Friction-Maxxing</em></a>.</p><h3>Design principles for technologists as culprits</h3><p>This might sound obvious, but when designing technology products, it helps to keep users’ needs <em>and well-being</em> in mind.</p><p><strong>Build robust fallback mechanisms:</strong> In the banking portal, when the “digital-only” system failed, neither the customer nor the employee could navigate an alternative path. The system had eliminated all other routes.</p><p>Before implementing AI assistance or intent-based shortcuts, think about whether the user can complete the task if the feature breaks or is unavailable. Build fallback mechanisms that allow manual navigation when automated paths fail, surface error states that help users understand what went wrong, provide enough context for users to troubleshoot independently, and maintain alternative paths to the same destination.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tGOrUoGbx8Q4_Dqgx6_wrw.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/9356221-deploy-fin-ai-agent-over-email"">Fin agent fallback</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Distinguish between transactional and developmental tasks:</strong> When developing automations, distinguish between <strong>transactional tasks</strong> (filing taxes, scheduling meetings, data entry) and <strong>developmental tasks</strong> (writing, learning, problem-solving, decision-making). This is similar to the idea of distinguishing between <a href=""https://outofdesk.blog/thinking-outside-the-doc"">competitive artifacts and complementary artifacts</a>.</p><p>Transactional tasks should be frictionless. These are tasks where efficiency is the primary goal, and there’s little value in the process itself. But developmental tasks benefit from <a href=""https://every.to/thesis/in-the-ai-age-making-things-difficult-is-deliberate"">good friction</a>. The process of navigating uncertainty is often where the real value lies.</p><p><a href=""https://danielmiessler.com/blog/keep-the-robots-out-of-the-gym"">“Gym skills”</a> is a good metaphor. For developmental tasks, consider AI as a collaborator that augments rather than replaces the user’s cognitive work. <a href=""https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/blog/the-importance-of-friction-in-ai-systems/"">Speculative and Critical Design (SCD)</a> framework lays out one of the most articulate ways to think about this.</p><p><strong>Adjust assistance based on expertise:</strong> Design systems that adjust assistance levels based on user expertise, because effective delegation requires good judgment on the user’s part.</p><p>Beginners benefit from more guidance, explanations, and visible structure to help them build mental models of the system. Intermediate users can make effective use of shortcuts and intent-based features, but in a way that traditional navigation is visible and accessible. Expert users demand customizability, creating their own navigation paths, or even disabling assistance they don’t need.</p><p>The problem with many AI-first products is that they apply the same level of automation to everyone, preventing users from ever developing expertise. A newly minted manager using AI to completely delegate the work of crafting performance reviews for the team, for example, isn’t going to build the muscle of reflecting on the relationships with people, paying attention to their motivations, strengths, and weaknesses.</p><p><strong>Preserve visible structure:</strong> Even with search-first or AI-first interfaces, users benefit from understanding the underlying structure. Consider <strong>visual sitemaps or navigation breadcrumbs</strong> that show users where they are in the system, <strong>contextual hints</strong> about where information lives, even when delivering it through search, and <strong>progressive disclosure</strong> that reveals structure as users engage more deeply with the product.</p><p><a href=""https://www.aiuxdesign.guide/"">aiuxdesign.guide</a> has a comprehensive set of design patterns that mention some of these and more, with real-world examples.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>There are a few pockets of life that haven’t been taken over by assistive and active technology. Building the muscle to tolerate (and design) good friction and (help) reclaiming the ownership of your attention are good starts to prepare for what’s ahead. There’s little I can do to navigate the banking system. But there are other areas I can exercise control, both as a creator and a consumer.</p><p><em>Find me on </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ggauravr/""><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em>, </em><a href=""https://x.com/outofdesk""><em>X</em></a><em>, or check out my </em><a href=""https://outofdesk.blog/""><em>blog here</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3>Inspirations and references</h3><ul><li><a href=""https://www.doc.cc/articles/ai-navigation"">DOC • A new navigation paradigm</a></li><li><a href=""https://signalpath.substack.com/p/do-ai-products-even-need-navigation"">Do AI Products Even Need Navigation? — by Andrew Sims</a></li><li><a href=""https://aeon.co/essays/bernard-stieglers-philosophy-on-how-technology-shapes-our-world"">Bernard Stiegler’s philosophy on how technology shapes our world | Aeon Essays</a></li><li><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7156656/"">Habitual use of GPS negatively impacts spatial memory during self-guided navigation — PMC</a></li><li><a href=""https://youtu.be/PK_zuAuI9x0?si=szB908spPScog_k6&amp;t=64"">Biswa Kalyan Rath | Birth Proof | Stand Up Comedy</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.thecut.com/article/brooding-friction-maxxing-new-years-2026-resolution.html"">In 2026, We Are Friction-Maxxing</a></li><li><a href=""https://iiif.library.cmu.edu/file/Simon_box00065_fld05031_bdl0001_doc0001/Simon_box00065_fld05031_bdl0001_doc0001.pdf"">THE THEORY OF PROBLEM SOLVING</a></li><li><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5248972/"">Organizing Conceptual Knowledge in Humans with a Grid-like Code — PMC</a></li><li><a href=""https://asana.com/ai-principles"">Asana — Our principles for helping humanity thrive with AI</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.psychoftech.org/blog/2020/3/10/cognitive-artifacts"">Cognitive Artifacts — Psychology of Technology Institute</a></li><li><a href=""https://every.to/thesis/in-the-ai-age-making-things-difficult-is-deliberate"">In the AI Age, Making Things Difficult Is Deliberate | Every</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.notion.com/blog/the-design-thinking-behind-notion-ai"">The Thinking Behind Notion AI</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/blog/the-importance-of-friction-in-ai-systems/"">The Importance of Fricton in AI Systems | Mozilla Foundation</a></li><li><a href=""https://hbr.org/2022/06/why-ai-customer-journeys-need-more-friction"">Why AI Customer Journeys Need More Friction | HBR</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.aiuxdesign.guide/"">AI UX Design Patterns</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=f6c63585f7af"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/getting-carried-away-when-intelligence-is-replaced-by-compliance-f6c63585f7af"">Getting carried away: When intelligence is replaced by compliance</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4><em>How product teams should evaluate AI-generated UI</em></h4><p>AI app-building tools have made it inconsequential and mundane to turn an idea into a working prototype. You only need a couple prompts, a design file, or even a sketch to quickly generate something that looks (even behaves) like a real product. For product teams, this speed has changed expectations in the design and development process.</p><p>Prototypes are no longer as special as they once were. They’re now the bare minimum.</p><p>But this speed comes with limitations. Many AI-generated prototypes are never meant to survive past the moment they’re validated. They do their job in a meeting or a user test, but then they’re rebuilt by engineering or even trashed. But the prototypes didn’t “fail,” they were just created with a different intention and outcome.</p><p>The hidden cost of AI prototypes is that they can’t move forward. And when the underlying output is treated as “disposable” automatically, product teams pay for it later in the product lifecycle through translation work, rewrites, and reduced speed.</p><figure><img alt=""Creating AI-prototypes in Anima and Replit tools"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tQwxealvhwQ05oy5oeR0CQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>AI tools have changed the design-dev workflow; can prototypes thrive through product stages?</em></figcaption></figure><p>It’s no question that AI has become part of everyday product development. But it’s no longer just how fast we can generate UI, it’s more about what kind of output we are creating. We need to think past prototypes that can be used for a 30 minute stakeholder review, such as thinking about what happens after the ideation stage ends.</p><p>Some tools are optimized for ideation and to quickly answer questions. But others are beginning to treat AI output as the first draft of real product work. Let’s get into understanding how AI prototypes can survive the product lifecycle, tools that are better for different prototype use cases, and criteria to help product teams choose the right prototype for their needs.</p><h3>What it means for an AI prototype to “survive”</h3><p>Most product teams don’t struggle to generate UI anymore. But they do have a challenge in deciding whether what they’ve generated is something they can both keep and use.</p><h4>It’s more than visual polish</h4><p>AI-generated prototypes can look visually polished and even behave as intended, but it still may not survive past the ideation phase. We need to think about what the prototype allows a product team to do after ideation.</p><p>Some questions to ask when deciding if your prototype will survive past ideation:</p><ul><li>Can the prototype be extended without starting over?</li><li>Can it be handed off without being reinterpreted?</li><li>Can it live outside the AI tool that created it?</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Design visuals and code output produced by Framer, but is limited to the tool itself"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oZwkGkR7NdhBq_lFLRSHnw.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.framer.com/""><em>Framer</em></a><em> automatically produces code for the visuals generated, but can it live outside Framer?</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you begin to think about the extensibility of your prototype too late (like after it’s been validated), you might quickly reach a dead end. Though the UI looks high-quality and finished, it deceives what’s lying under the hood in the actual output.</p><p>Not only that, many AI-generated prototypes are abstract. They render well in the tool that created them, but the underlying structure is hazy or even constricted to the AI tool. These prototypes do help answer early questions, like “Does this flow make sense?,” but they’re difficult to carry forward without translation or rework.</p><h4>Proper structure outlasts visuals</h4><p>Durable prototypes are built from real frontend formatting, like structured markup, predictable layout, and clear component usage. This structure makes the prototype legible to engineers, collaborators, and the AI tools themselves.</p><p>When the prototype’s output is inspectable and portable to other tools, it can be understood and evolved.</p><figure><img alt=""Code output from Anima App that prioritizes production-readiness and portability"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wt9uB0MxkXLJ4PUX2_f0_w.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://dev.animaapp.com/""><em>Anima App</em></a><em> generates designs and code intended to be used outside the tool</em></figcaption></figure><p>AI tools can only amplify the inputs and outputs you continue to build from. Abstract AI output compounds into rework with teams regenerating or rebuilding what already exists. But clean, structured output encourages faster iteration and usable output because each change builds on the last.</p><p>An AI prototype’s “lifespan” reflects what the tool was optimized to create. Understanding the distinction between a disposable or durable helps teams choose tools that match what they intend to build.</p><h3>How AI app-building tools optimize for different lifespans</h3><p>Once you start looking at AI-generated prototypes in terms of their lifespan, you’ll notice patterns across popular AI tools available to product teams. You’re probably assuming that AI app-building tools are all trying to do the same thing, like producing high-quality designs and code.</p><p>But these AI tools are actually optimized for different stages in the product lifecycle. Most fall under three main buckets: full-stack generators, visual builders, or design-native generators. Let’s look at familiar tools found in each bucket.</p><h4>Full-stack AI generators</h4><p>Full-stack generators like Bolt, Lovable, and Replit are designed to produce end-to-end applications quickly. They can handle the generated app’s infrastructure, hosting, and behavior for multiple user flows. These tools are powerful when experimenting or needing quick product deployments.</p><figure><img alt=""Full-stack AI tools like Replit create rapid prototypes for desktop and mobile"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RBqDSAceLsOOOPUDy3qTqg.png"" /><figcaption><em>AI tools like </em><a href=""https://replit.com/products/design""><em>Replit</em></a><em> are ideal for small product teams with rapid timelines</em></figcaption></figure><p>Benefits:</p><ul><li>Extremely fast method to go from idea to working application</li><li>Low setup needed for end-to-end generation</li><li>Allows quick validation for solo or small teams</li></ul><p>Limitations:</p><ul><li>Code output is typically bound to the tool that generated it</li><li>Code structure prioritizes quick execution over long-term durability</li><li>Harder integrate the frontend work into existing codebases</li><li>Less flexibility when engineers need more control</li></ul><h4>Visual building tools</h4><p>Visual builders such as Webflow and Framer are ideal for creating polished experiences that live within the platform itself. They’re well-suited for marketing sites or even personal websites where the tool itself is part of the delivery method. Since the AI tool is also the production environment, handoff of frontend code to engineering is secondary or unnecessary.</p><figure><img alt=""Visual builders like Framer produce responsive and visual UI, but are constrained to the tool itself"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3ckByB8Nntl2Mvs1kD7TMw.png"" /><figcaption><em>Visual builders like </em><a href=""https://www.framer.com/""><em>Framer</em></a><em> produce responsive and visual UI, but are constrained to the tool</em></figcaption></figure><p>Benefits:</p><ul><li>High-fidelity, production-quality visual output</li><li>Supports publishing, hosting, and content management workflows</li><li>Designers can own and ship real experiences</li><li>Reliable for marketing and personal websites</li></ul><p>Limitations:</p><ul><li>Exported code is not intended for strategic evolution</li><li>Included logic in the frontend is dependent on the platform</li><li>Restricts deep engineering customization and may need rework</li></ul><h4>Design-native generators</h4><p>Design-native generation tools, like Figma Make, are ideal for high-speed exploration. They help teams iterate on structure, layout, and user flow directly inside the design tool. The output is effective as a reference when reviewing and testing, but it’s not intended to be integrated in a production codebase.</p><figure><img alt=""Figma Make is integrated within the design tool, but it’s focused more on visual output versus code"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Igk5W5dDfw6FN99LpI2JSQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1IssNgKM28""><em>Figma Make</em></a><em> is integrated within the design tool, but the output focuses on visual vs. code output</em></figcaption></figure><p>Benefits:</p><ul><li>Fast iteration inside existing design-product workflows</li><li>Smooth exploration for UI layouts and user flows</li><li>Effective for early validation and team collaboration</li></ul><p>Limitations:</p><ul><li>Output is a reference versus a code foundation</li><li>Engineers may need to rebuild rather than extend the frontend code</li><li>Optimized for exploration, but not product maturation</li></ul><p>None of these tool approaches are inherently better or worse, but teams need to understand what each tool is optimized to do. Whether it be to answer questions early in the ideation phase or to publish product experience. They just reflect different assumptions about what happens after a prototype proves its point.</p><h3>Designing AI-generated prototypes to continue past ideation</h3><p>Most AI-generated prototypes were created to answer questions or validate a direction while in the ideation phase. They weren’t produced to become part of the actual product.</p><p>But instead of asking, “How fast can we generate this?,” teams need to start asking, “What happens if this works?” That shift changes what kind of output matters and the right tool to use.</p><p>To help with this shift, teams need to generate prototypes that are made from the same fundamentals as production. This includes real HTML elements, predictable layout, and clear UI components to make the output understandable to engineers and other tools.</p><h4>AI accelerates continuity or disposability</h4><p>This is where the output’s effects on AI are unavoidable. Because each AI-generation builds on what already exists, unstructured output compounds issues–causing regenerating or rebuilding the same ideas again and again.</p><p>So prototypes designed to continue get better as the AI-generations evolve, while prototypes designed to be temporary get replaced.</p><figure><img alt=""Anima generates prototypes starting from Figma designs, live websites, or brand inspiration"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Tl2SNCCCw0yqtdTvE_npRw.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://dev.animaapp.com/""><em>Anima</em></a><em> can generate prototypes starting from Figma designs or live websites</em></figcaption></figure><h4>Tools that create durable AI prototypes</h4><p>Real products progress from existing interfaces/ patterns or partial designs; not from blank prompts. Tools that support starting from design files, live URLs, or existing UI allow teams to preserve context instead of recreating it within a prompt.</p><p>AI tools like Anima approach producing prototypes this way. The tool focuses on creating structured, real frontend code that can be handed off to development versus showing a high-quality render of UI designs.</p><figure><img alt=""Anima creates both high-fidelity visuals and code ready to be exported outside the tool"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uDzBp4JfFjnUDNhD-uiUkg.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://dev.animaapp.com/""><em>Anima</em></a><em> creates both high-fidelity visuals and code ready to be exported outside the tool</em></figcaption></figure><p>Anima’s prototypes include added value not only from their usability from the get-go, but by reducing translation work once engineers begin to review the code output.</p><p>Designing AI prototypes doesn’t mean every prototype has to be production-ready. It just means product teams can choose whether the work they’re creating is meant to be disposable or durable.</p><h3>How teams should decide what kind of prototype they’re building</h3><p>Before evaluating any AI app-building tool, product teams need to clarify a few questions to select relevant criteria to rate each tool against. This will allow teams to use tools more intentionally and avoid the disposal of work later in the design lifecycle.</p><p>Questions teams should ask themselves:</p><ul><li>What is this prototype meant to do? (i.e., validate an idea vs. create production work)</li><li>What happens after idea validation? (i.e., restart/ re-build vs. handoff to engineers)</li><li>Should code output be modified outside the AI tool? (or is it okay for output to be bound to the tool?)</li><li>Should the code and AI tool support long-term iteration? (or is the output only for one-off ideas?)</li></ul><p>If your team’s goals are to validate ideas quickly, disposable prototypes are a wanted tool outcome versus a flaw. But if the goal is to create prototypes that will evolve into production, you’ll need AI tools that support that.</p><figure><img alt=""The AI tool for your team depends on your workflow and the intended deliverables, like useful visuals or useful code"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UMQymkGoKbUlTF5NWrje0g.png"" /><figcaption><em>Selecting an AI tool for your team depends on your workflow and the intended deliverables</em></figcaption></figure><h4>Optimize for the prototype lifespan you need</h4><p>Different tools optimize for different lifespans; here is a key to help make quick decisions:</p><ul><li>Short-lived artifacts that answer questions quickly → Design-native generators</li><li>Platform-contained experiences that publish efficiently → Visual building tools</li><li>Structured outputs that can serve as production foundations → Full-stack AI generators</li></ul><p>Again, none of these tools are superior. The right choice just depends on how long the work is expected to “live” and who will own it from iteration to iteration.</p><p>When teams evaluate tools based on intention, like what they’ll be able to keep or build on, they shift their mindset from only speed alone to idea continuity.</p><p>AI has dramatically lowered the cost of starting in such a short time-span. Quickly generating interfaces, user flows, and functional apps is no longer the hard part. But now, it isn’t how quickly product teams can produce prototypes, it’s how much of that work they can carry forward.</p><p>The hidden cost of AI prototypes isn’t that they fail to deliver. It’s that many were never designed to.

<p>As a fashion writer, dressing up for New York Fashion Week is both exhilarating and daunting to me (especially during the February shows when a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-jackets-for-women"">winter coat</a> can make or break your outfit). Do I opt for an all-black, NY journalist uniform? Do I try to go all out like one of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-street-style"">Getty-photographed fashion darlings</a>? Or do I dress on-theme for specific shows? Decisions, decisions!<br /><br />At this point, I’ve grown accustomed to the chaos and long days of NYFW, so I like to plan my outfits well ahead of time. When I was planning out this season’s looks for seven straight days, I predominately considered pieces that I’d feel most comfortable in — because when I left my BK home, I certainly wasn’t going back to do a not-so-quick change in the middle of my packed schedule.<br /><br />Leaning on the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-2026-fashion-beauty-lookbook"">Refinery29’s Winter 2026 Lookbook</a> for some outfit inspiration, I decided that — with what I already had in my closet and what brands graciously leant to me for the week — I’d put my own twist on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-fashion-beauty-trends-forecast-2025-2026"">“The Demuralist” look</a> (with hints of The Weather-Maxxer and The Holiday Host aesthetics) for Day 2 of NYFW.<br /><br />In this reimagined Roaring Twenties look: “The all-black uniform gets a festive lift here with sequins and quietly elegant accessories.” While I’m not the most sparkly person, I took bits and pieces from this modern flapper aesthetic and styled a glam look that could take me from day to night, across the city, and confidently into five designers’ runway shows.<br /><br />Ahead, see how I interpreted R29’s stylist-vetted Demuralist trend, the exact pieces I wore (including an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-trends"">on-trend hat moment</a>), and outfit inspo to get you through the rest of the frigid winter in style. </p>

<p>Some themes of “The Demuralist” include dark palettes, luxe details, and rich textures. “We wanted to lean into this idea of the ‘20s and that being a reference point for celebration,” stylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/christinenicholson__/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Christine Nicholson</a> told me behind the scenes of the R29 photoshoot. “We kept the idea of craftsmanship as it relates to things like beading, but made it feel new and fresh.” <br /><br />Taking style cues (but not hard and fast rules) from the lookbook, I opted for my black <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/madewell-alexa-chung-collaboration-2024"">Madewell x Alexa Chung</a> oversized corduroy blazer, rather than a statement dress. I just love the thick fabric and unexpected bright-white buttons. I doubled down on the textures of this look by wearing a white ribbed sweater with fluffy wrist cuffs (that perfectly peeked out from my blazer sleeves) from <a href=""https://www.cupshe.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cupshe</a>. And while the R29 model was styled in funky culottes under her <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/spring-dress-trends-2025"">drop-waist dress</a>, I chose my unassumingly stretchy and comfy trousers from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-lululemon-gifts"">Lululemon</a> that I knew would keep my legs warm.<br /><br />With my base layers offering a more masculine silhouette, it then came time to jazz up the look with feminine flapper energy through accessorizing. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959893.jpeg?width=854&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=427%3A512"" /></figure></div>

<p>The Demuralist look consists of long sequined gloves (Note: opera gloves were everywhere during NYFW!), fuzzy Mary Jane heels, and, of course, a spectacular headpiece. And to my delight, I knew just the pieces that would give a similar festive and vintage flair, that felt wearable; not just editorial. <br /><br />I excitedly whipped out the funky magenta fur mittens I had purchased as a tween. (While they at one point revolted me, they’re of course back in style and add a touch of whimsy to every winter outfit.) I also slipped on my burgundy <a href=""https://www.vivaia.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Vivaia</a> knit waterproof boots, which were the perfect touch of color and texture (and sensible for the snowy streets).<br /><br />The cherry on top of this ’20s-esque look came about while rummaging through <a href=""https://tjmaxx.tjx.com/store/index.jsp"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">TJ Maxx</a> (my favorite pastime). I stumbled on a burgundy faux fur trapper-like hat that felt like it was from a past era, and knew I wanted to wear it during NYFW.<br /><br />The final touch (that I picked up just one day before NYFW) was an incredible faux fur scarf-shawl-hybrid from <a href=""https://misscircle.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miss Circle</a>. It was so luxe and dramatic, and helped me channel some flapper energy. (It also brought me the biggest compliments from industry peers throughout the day!)</p>

<p>While translating a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-2026-fashion-beauty-lookbook"">bold editorial photoshoot fashion look</a> into a wearable IRL look was at first daunting, the final outcome wound up being one of my favorite NYFW outfits to date.<br /><br />Taking notes from the R29 Lookbook helped inspire an outfit I may have never put together otherwise. In the end, my interpretation had me feeling festive, comfortable, confident, and most importantly, like myself. And I can say with confidence that you <em>have </em>to try it for yourself too.</p>

<p>As a beauty editor of ten years, I’ve been a guest at a fair share of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dyson-hairstyling-tools-worth-it-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">hair tool</a> launch events, from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-flexfusion-styler-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">blow-out brushes</a> that are like having your own personal hairstylist, to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mermade-hair-curling-iron-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">curling irons</a> that use clever mechanisms to draw your hair in and form a perfect tousle. But none have drawn as many collective “Oohs” and “Ahhs” from my editor peers as <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fshark-silkipro-straight-wet-to-dry-straightener-rapid-blow-dryer-plum-satin%2FHT400PU.html%3Fdwvar_HT400PU_color%3DA875B3"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shark’s new SilkiPro</a>. </p>



<p>I know what you’re thinking: <em>another hair tool?</em> And you’d have a fair point. In recent years, Shark has unveiled the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fbuild-your-own-shark-glam-hot-tool-air-styling-drying-system%2FHD6000PKSN.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glam AirStyling System</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fshark-glossi-2-in-1-hot-tool-and-air-glosser-juniper%2FHT302TL.html%3Fdwvar_HT302TL_color%3D429195"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glossi Hot Tool</a>, and the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fbuild-your-own-shark-flexstyle-air-styling-drying-system-stone%2FHD400SN.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">FlexStyle Drying and Styling System</a> (a personal favorite of mine). But the SilkiPro Straight is different. No, really — it straightened my thick, wavy hair in ten minutes flat when it usually takes 30. But more on that later.  </p>



<h2>What is Shark’s SilkiPro Straight and what are the benefits? </h2>



<p><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fshark-silkipro-straight-wet-to-dry-straightener-rapid-blow-dryer-plum-satin%2FHT400PU.html%3Fdwvar_HT400PU_color%3DA875B3"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shark’s SilkiPro</a> is a wet-to-dry straightener and blowdryer in one. Imagine your current flat iron had discreet vents inside that released warm air for a smoother finish with every pass, and you’ve got the idea.  </p>



<p>At the bottom of the tool, there’s a slide-up button that lets you select a mode for wet or damp hair, which emits heated airflow — with the intensity controlled via a separate button. There’s another mode for dry hair, which relies solely on the ceramic straightening plates, without additional airflow. In other words, it combines everything you love about a flat iron — quick, high-shine results — with the benefits of a blowdry brush like less frizz and a smoother finish.  </p>



<p>Perhaps the most brilliant feature is the built-in blowdryer. You can lock the tool closed, and the airflow comes out from the sides, letting you rough-dry your hair before styling. </p>

<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960140.png?width=918&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=459%3A512"" /></figure>



<h2>What makes Shark’s SilkiPro Straight special? </h2>



<p>At Shark’s launch event, I was lucky enough to see the tool in action on two models — one with very thick, curly hair and another with fine, wavy hair. LA-based hairstylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jaybirmingham_/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jay Birmingham</a> was on hand to demonstrate, and I was mesmerized by how quickly it slid through the first model’s curls, leaving a sleek handful of hair in just a couple of passes.  </p>



<p>According to Birmingham, this is largely thanks to the smart, inconspicuous slots inside the tool, which accommodate combs in three different sizes — all included with the tool. Birmingham explained that if you usually “chase” your straightener with a comb or brush to achieve a smooth, sleek finish, there’s no need anymore — it’s essentially built in. The larger wide-tooth comb is especially brilliant for thick, curly, and coily hair.  </p>



<p>On the model with finer, straighter hair, Birmingham demonstrated how to create flat-iron waves by clamping the straightener on the hair and twisting it downward. When he released, it produced the most effortless tousled look. </p>

<h2>What’s the difference between Shark’s SilkiPro Straight and the Dyson AirStrait? </h2>



<p>Now, you’re probably wondering how the SilkiPro compares to Dyson’s AirStrait. While they look similar at first glance, they’re actually quite different. The AirStrait doesn’t have ceramic hot plates, whereas the SilkiPro does. This means you can use it without airflow on dry hair to straighten, create waves, or touch up your style. If you ask me, it’s also lighter and perhaps quieter — and unlike the Dyson, it comes with those aforementioned slide-in combs.  </p>



<p>Dyson’s hallmark is that its tools don’t cause heat damage, so you might assume the ceramic plates on the SilkiPro would fry your hair like a traditional straightener. Fortunately, the SilkiPro has heat sensors that adjust the temperature automatically when it gets too hot, lending silky results without split ends. Of course, repeatedly going over a section or holding the plates down for too long can still cause damage, but because it works so quickly, one or two slow passes is usually enough. (And I always recommend heat protection.) </p>



<p>In terms of results, Dyson’s tool leaves hair looking more naturally straight and swishy, while Shark’s makes mine look sleek and pin-straight. If you have layers, and you like a tool that gives your lengths some movement, the former might be a better option, or one of Shark’s round blowdry brushes.  </p>



<p>At $249.99, it’s not exactly budget-friendly, but it is slightly more affordable than the AirStrait.</p>

<h2>What to know about Shark’s SilkiPro Straight Wet to Dry Straightener + Rapid Blow Dryer </h2>



<p><strong>• </strong>A straightener-meets-blowdryer featuring different levels of airflow and temperature-controlled ceramic plates for straightening, blow-drying, and creating waves. </p>



<p><strong>• </strong>Comes with three slide-in comb attachments: a wide-tooth comb for curly or coily hair, a gentle comb for natural straight styles, and a precision comb for maximum tension. </p>



<p>• Lightweight, quiet, and suitable for all hair types.  </p>



<h2>How do you use Shark’s SilkiPro Straight? </h2>



<p>Although “wet” is in the name, SilkiPro is best used on damp or towel-dried hair. I used the blowdryer function to rough-dry my hair to about 90% dry before switching to the “For WET Hair” setting on medium heat with full airflow. Happily, you can choose both the temperature and airflow level to suit you. </p>



<p>I have one stubborn step-like wave at the back of my head, which hairstylists usually struggle to smooth with a blowdryer and round brush, but this smoothed them out in just two passes. The chunky ceramic plates, combined with the extra airflow, work together to make hair silky, straight, and soft without much effort. </p>



<p>While the tool itself looks quite large, I can confirm that because the ceramic plates extend all the way to the tip, it’s easy to reach the roots and smooth out frizz and flyaways. I managed to straighten all my hair in just 10 minutes, when it usually takes me 30. Some might call it sorcery, but I know Shark has been quietly perfecting this behind the scenes for years. </p>



<p>Beyond the smart plates and directed airflow, the gentle comb attachment helped the tool glide through my knotty hair like a hot knife through butter. I also love that the tool quiets down when you put it down and starts up again when you pick it up, making it less overstimulating. </p>



<p>Will it replace my trusty Shark Glossi? I think so — once I’ve grown my layers out. I prefer a blunt cut with straight hair on me. That said, my friends with curly hair are already eyeing it up, so who knows how long I’ll be able to hold onto it… </p>

<p>I’ve been to a lot of fashion shows. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-street-style"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">New York Fashion Week</a> is basically a sport at this point and I’m basically an Olympian. You prep, you glam, you Uber in heels because you can’t actually walk in them, and you pray the show starts late. I’ve mastered the rhythm. I know how to move. But this time, it felt different. Because for the first time ever, I wasn’t just attending a show, I was being dressed for one. And not just by anyone. By <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sergiohudson/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sergio Hudson</a>. For his <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-ready-to-wear/sergio-hudson"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Fall/Winter 2026</a> runway. On his 10th anniversary. I’m still pinching myself.  </p>



<p><strong>My Favorite Room During Fashion Week</strong> </p>



<p>Sergio Hudson’s show is hands down my favorite show to attend during New York Fashion Week. The collections are always versatile. Whether you’re a corporate baddie running a boardroom, the belle of the ball at a gala, or just a fashion girly who loves to throw that fit on, Sergio has a piece for you. And his casting is inclusive. Always. In a fashion world that still struggles with representation, his runway actually looks like us.   </p>

<p>The room itself feels like the hottest and chicest invite of the year but never exclusive in a weird way. Everyone from <a href=""https://www.gettyimages.dk/detail/news-photo/yolanda-adams-sergio-hudson-and-monica-attend-sergio-hudson-news-photo/2261636426"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Monica</a> to <a href=""https://hellobeautiful.com/4581318/jackie-aina-nyfw/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jackie Aina</a> was there. And somehow, no one feels more important than the other. You feel like you belong. </p>



<p><strong>The Showroom Moment</strong> </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960042.jpg?width=583&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=583%3A1024"" /><figcaption>Screenshot</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>A few days before the show, I went to the Sergio Hudson showroom to find my look. My first option was a red blazer moment. It was giving “I own the company,” but I wasn’t fully sold. I wanted a <em>moment</em>. Then one of the stylists pulled out a silver sequin dress and I knew. I paired it with a gray wool coat draped over my shoulders and yeah, this was the bold statement I needed to make. It felt regal, dramatic, and intentional. All I needed were silver heels to finish it off. If you’re going to be dressed by Sergio Hudson for his 10th anniversary show, you don’t play small. </p>



<p><strong>Fashion Week Tried Me</strong> </p>



<p>Now here’s where the plot thickens. Show day was a mess. On the day of the show, I still hadn’t found the perfect shoes. I had two hair appointments. I had to shower, do my makeup, get dressed, and be there by 6:45 PM. </p>



<p>Appointments got pushed. My hair didn’t finish until 5 PM. I rushed home, threw on my dress, did my makeup with one eye on the clock, and ran out the door. I got in the Uber at 6:20 PM. and because it’s New York… traffic!  </p>



<p>What should have been a quick ride turned into over an hour. I was panicking the entire time. All that prep. All that anticipation. Just to possibly miss the show? I felt defeated sitting in that back seat. But by the grace of God, I made it. The show started ten minutes after I arrived. And I’m choosing to be a delusional queen and believe they stalled it for me.  </p>



<p><strong>10 Years of Excellence</strong> </p>



<p>The collection was out of this world. Bold colors. Chic tailoring. Fierce models. Looks that quite literally took your breath away. It felt celebratory but forward. A reminder that ten years in this industry, especially as a Black designer, is no small thing.  </p>

<p>It’s safe to say my outfit was a hit. As I walked into the show and later as walked out, people were taking photos of me. Complimenting the dress. Stopping me mid-step. For a moment, I felt like a queen.  </p>



<p>Being dressed by a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-designers-fashion-technology"">Black designer</a>, celebrating his milestone, and sitting in a room filled with culture, excellence, and intention will always be one of the highlights of my career.  </p>



<p>Supporting Black-owned designers like Sergio Hudson isn’t just about fashion, it’s about community. It’s about showing up for the people who reflect us, design for us, and see us. I already can’t wait for the next show. </p>

<p>Over the last week, New York City proved its status as a fashion capital of the world, with talented designers showcasing creative collections on the runways, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-street-style"">in the streets</a>, and on our feeds. From “let them eat cake” aesthetics and double-duty bags to fringed frocks and leather opera gloves, New York Fashion Week brought <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-color-trends-2026"">statement fashion trends</a> and serious 2026 outfit inspo to the forefront.<br /><br />In order to get the front-row scoop on what will be huge for the fall and winter of 2026, I attended so many fashion shows and presentations that my heels hurt and phone was always on the brink of losing power. The endeavor was more than worth it because I found the standout trends (that I think you can start implementing into your wardrobe while it’s still cold!). The wonderfully disheveled <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/saltburn-indie-sleaze-2000s-fashion"">indie sleaze look</a> and head-to-toe <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-cow-print"">animal prints</a> that dominated New York’s runways are especially great for party looks, while <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/02/11305994/brooch-fashion-accessory-trend"">brooches</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-balaclavas-bonnets-knitted-hooded-scarf"">headwear</a> can add flair to any winter outfit.<br /><br />Ahead, see which brands — from New York staples like Tory Burch to NYFW debuts like that of designer-denim staple 7 For All Mankind — took on similar trends in their own unique points of view.  Then shop styles to get the looks.</p>

<h2>Vintage-Inspired Brooches for Today</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959927.png?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>Wondering what the stand-out accessory of the A/W 2026 shows were? It <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shoe-trends-2026"">wasn’t just one shoe trend</a> or a particular purse or a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-tarnish-free-gold-jewelry"">statement necklace</a>. It was the brooch. Ranging from metal sculptures from the likes of Caroline Herrera, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-x-cult-gaia-collaboration-shop"">Cult Gaia</a>, and Tory Burch; crystal cascades courtesy of Collina Strada; 3D glass florals by Caroline Zimbalist; and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUvv79tCbKo/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sergio Hudson</a>’s fabric-covered designs, many brands put their seal of approval on a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/designer-fashion-secondhand-the-realreal-ebay-poshmark"">vintage staple</a>.<br /><br />These modern designs might look out of place in your grandmother’s jewelry box (but that doesn’t mean she won’t want to borrow your baubles from time to time!). Pin them to your sweater, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-jackets-for-women"">winter coat</a>, or to secure your scarf for fashion <em>and</em> function. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Animals Gone Wild</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959932.png?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>I can confidently say that animal prints will never go out of style. In fact, they’ve essentially become neutrals that can seamlessly integrate into everyone’s wardrobes today. This season, brands like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/old-navy-anna-sui-collaboration-2025"">Anna Sui</a>, Norma Kamali, Ralph Lauren, and Ulla Johnson tapped the fan-favorite cheetah and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-leopard-print-2"">leopard prints</a>. Looking to find inspiration from other corners of the animal kingdom? Kim Shui and Markarian introduced tiger prints, while Kate Hundley and Sergio Hudson offered snakeskin sets, and Bronx and Banco sent out a zebra purse.<br /><br />Animal illustrations were also big sources of inspiration, as Alix of Bohemia featured a whole zoo worth of animal prints and embellishments (think: giraffes and monkeys!). Swans also popped up across Tanner Fletcher outerwear and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DU4lDRfiI_F/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Aknvas</a> button-downs if avian-inspired looks are more your style.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong>The Grunge &amp; Indie Sleaze Scene</strong></h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959934.png?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>For those of us who <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-sandy-liang-collaboration-2025"">crave nostalgia</a>, it’s exciting to note that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/madewell-alexa-chung-collaboration-2025"">the ‘90s</a> and early 2000s have never been more back! Specifically, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/joaquina-90s-grunge-era-jcpenney-collection"">moody grunge</a> and indie sleaze party-girl aesthetics are having a moment, with dark palettes, messy styling, and even disheveled, slept-in hair (look no further than Collina Strada’s models for proof). <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-dresses-for-women"">Plaid prints</a> featured heavily in the anchor pieces of several collections, including <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/coach-handbag-trends"">Coach</a>’s youthful blazers as well as Collina Strada’s and Private Policy’s dresses.<br /><br />The <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUuHzuajEmc/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">7 For All Mankind runway show</a> was also a master class in early-aughts styling, down to the energy and even the <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUuXgANjkvZ/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">models’ viral walks</a>. Think, lots of layering, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/denim-trends-2026"">all-denim-everything</a>, skinny scarves, platform pumps, jumbo shoulder bags, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-chunky-jewelry"">chunky jewelry</a> all together — because in this case, more is more. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Hat Attack</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959935.png?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>Bundling up in the cold has never looked so chic. Hats and headpieces served as the cherry on top of this season’s runway looks, serving inspiration for right now and next winter. Designers especially made the case for having headwear for every outfit and event, no matter how casual or fancy. Designs included chic pillbox hats and caps that tie around the neck (Christian Cowan), fur trapper hats and headbands (Aknvas and Bronc and Banco), oversized knit silhouettes (Advisry), extra-long beanies (Private Policy), lace skull caps (Prabal Gurung and LaQuan Smith), and beaded head coverings (Jane Wade) across womenswear <em>and</em> menswear alike.<br /><br />The impossibly stylish <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/02/11856777/asap-rocky-verdict-court-case-timeline"">A$AP Rocky</a> even wore a fur trapper to close out the NYFW debut of his brand AWGE, giving hats a celebrity stamp of approval! </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>All Laced Up</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959936.png?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>While the collections that New York City’s designers showed this season weren’t as stiff or structured as some in the past, lacing still showed up as a major throughline. For proof, look no further than Adeam’s, Elena Velez’s, and Meruert Tolegen’s not-so-basic corsets and dresses.<br /><br />Those seeking more casual interpretations of the trend can turn to Kate Hundley’s lace-up <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-puffer-jacket"">puffer jacket</a>, which is proof that your winter puffer can not only not ruin your outfit; it can make your entire look. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUxFffpjp26/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Gabe Gordon</a>’s lace-up knit skirt also feels as right for après ski as it does for a Saturday <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nyfw-fall-winter-2024-trends"">athleisure look</a>. Laces even made their way into the models’ hair at Caroline Zimbalist as an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-haircut-trends-fall-winter-2026"">unexpected hairstyle trend</a>.</p>

Having a pair felt like everything. I remember dreaming about them, imagining how it would feel to finally wear them and show them off,” she told the publication. <br /><br />The sneakers were so popular among Latine youth that Reebok even collaborated with the biggest star of reggaeton at the time, Daddy Yankee, for a “DY” signature sneaker and apparel line in 2005.<br /><br />Now, with reggaeton one of the most popular genres in the world and Karol G as one of its front-runners, it’s her turn. And the Grammy award-winning singer isn’t just wearing Reebok Classics like she dreamed — campaign photos of her in the 131-year-old footwear brand can be seen all over, from Medellín to the rest of the world. <br /><br />As part of “Born Classic. Worn For Life,” the sports culture brand launched its most popular lifestyle sneakers crafted in 100% real, full-grain premium garment leather, including Club C 85 Vintage, Freestyle Lo, Workout Plus. <br /><br />And while the sneakers were just made available on February 18, <a href=""https://wwd.com/footwear-news/shoe-trends/karol-g-reebok-ambassador-media-impact-value-1238514597/"">WWD reported</a> in late January that just the announcement of Karol G as Reebok’s latest ambassador generated $1.1 million in Media Impact Value (MIV) in 48 hours for the footwear brand. <br /><br />Swipe to see what all the hype is about.<figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959871.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=2400&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""2400"" /><figcaption><strong>Club C 85 Vintage</strong> <br /><br />When Reebok introduced the Club C 85 in 1985, it was a clean, performance-driven sneaker built for tennis champions.

<p>Over the last few days, the social media firing squad has been aimed at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tyrabanks/"">Tyra Banks</a> and the producers behind <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363307/""><em>America’s Next Top Model</em></a>, the cultural phenomenon of a reality show that aired from 2003 to 2018 and spawned dozens of international spinoffs. <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/81928842?trackId=259776131&amp;trkId=259776131&amp;src=tudum""><em>Reality Check: Inside America’s Next Top Model</em></a> is proof that the more things change, the more they stay the same.</p>



<p>The Netflix docuseries, which premiered on February 11, featured firsthand accounts from models, including <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ebonyehaith/?hl=en"">Ebony Haith</a> (Cycle 1), <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/shandithecatlady/?hl=en"">Shandi Sullivan</a> (Cycle 2) and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/danievans1/?hl=en"">Danielle Evans</a> (Cycle 6) as well as judges <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/mrjaymanuel/?hl=en"">Jay Manuel</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/miss_jalexander/?hl=en"">J. Alexander</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/nigelbarker/?hl=en"">Nigel Barker</a>. Through three episodes, viewers get a firsthand look at the exploitative conditions contestants were subjected to each cycle. That included extreme makeovers using plastic surgery and dental work, blackface and racist stereotypes as photoshoot themes and a sexual assault that was intentionally caught on film. Banks and former <em>ANTM</em> executive producer <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0596298/"">Ken Mok</a>, who both served as executive producers for <em>Reality Check</em>, were also interviewed.</p>



<p>For 24 cycles, Banks was able to bully women into becoming the American ideal standard of what the “ideal woman” was at that time. And for millennials who were coming of age at the height of the show, it was not only appointment television; it was a rubric for how to become worthy of adoration.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959823.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /><figcaption>Reality Check: Inside America’s Next Top Model.

<p><em>ANTM</em> was one of the first times millennials witnessed hyperfemininity politics on display in the media through a reality show competition. As a little Black girl from the Midwest, watching the women who looked like me on the show further ingrained a conditioning that was already at play: that, to the world, I could only be beautiful with conditions. With <em>Reality Check</em>, flashbacks of Ebony’s gorgeous skin being called dull and ashy came rushing to the forefront. Danielle Evans being pressured to close her gap influenced me to want braces (thank you for not acquiescing, mom). Watching judges dismiss the concerns of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/iamtoccarajones/?hl=en"">Tocarra Jones</a> (Cycle 3), a full-figured woman from my hometown who I grew up looking up to, injured my confidence as I grew into my own curves.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Banks skirts accountability in an astonishingly delusional manner throughout the docuseries. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>And as a child, I was convinced Black girls couldn’t show their hurt like <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1909197/"">Tiffany Richardson</a> (Cycle 4) did, lest be seen as aggressive, ungrateful and undeserving.</p>



<p>“It was very, very intense but you guys were demanding it, and so we kept pushing more and more and more,” Banks said in <em>Reality Check</em>.</p>



<p>Banks skirts accountability in an astonishingly delusional manner throughout the docuseries. The trauma this show left with these women — especially the sexual assault of Shandi, which the documentary doesn’t name as such — was real, and Banks is to blame. At the same time, there’s some validity in her statement that we can’t ignore. No, viewers didn’t force Banks to exploit these women,  and much of the trauma they were subjected to has come into perspective only recently, but the buck doesn’t stop with Banks or this show.</p>

Dani Evans in Reality Check: Inside America’s Next Top Model. Cr. Courtesy of Netflix © 2026</figcaption></figure>



<p><em>ANTM</em> wasn’t just a look into the exploitative extremes models experienced behind the scenes. It held a mirror up to the homogenous beauty standards that Americans celebrated in the early to mid aughts. The message was resounding: thin and white was right. And if you were a woman of color, you better adapt quickly if you want to get anywhere.</p>



<p>As we sit firmly in 2026, it’s clear how wrong Banks and the producers were in their abuse of power. But what’s being overlooked is that history is repeating itself right before our eyes.</p>

<p>With social media, there’s an insurmountable pressure that comes with showing up as your best. And unlike in 2003, the feedback is in real time. With a growing amount of content creators and influencers relying on social media platforms for their livelihoods, it takes more time, energy and money than ever before to keep up with appearances. For many, that’s the difference between economic stability or missing out on opportunities.</p>



<p>Body positivity feels like a thing of the past as the idea of thinness reemerges as a status symbol and the <a href=""https://www.today.com/video/cosmetic-surgery-is-drawing-younger-patients-and-more-men-250889285677"">demand for cosmetic procedures</a> for younger groups increases. Doctors and marketers <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/glp-1-brands-enter-their-super-bowl-era/"">push GLP-1s</a> on any and everyone regardless of clinical need. And <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sydney_sweeney/"">Sydney Sweeney’s</a> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/08/11924722/sydney-sweeney-american-eagle-ad-controversy-republican-trump"">“great jeans” American Eagle ad</a> feels in conversation with <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/miketyson/"">Mike Tyson’s</a> <a href=""https://mashable.com/article/mike-tyson-super-bowl-ad-maha-fatphobia"">fat shaming Super Bowl ad</a> funded by Make America Healthy Again.</p>



<p>In addition, the needle hasn’t moved much on Black women being labeled “aggressive” and facing <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/07/11923428/jana-craig-love-island-kenny-rodriguez-breakup"">microaggressions and outright racism</a> on and off screen. Even in the show “The Traitors,” Black contestants are given <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/jan/09/black-contestants-the-traitors-reality-tv"">far less grace</a> to prove themselves as “faithfuls” due to stereotypes being used as evidence of their integrity.</p>

<p>So many of us who watched <em>ANTM</em> growing up have done work to divorce ourselves from the limiting beliefs that the show and others instilled in us growing up. (For me, that looked like embracing my curves and natural hair.) But witnessing progressive ideas of beauty disappear in media while it simultaneously shames Banks feels a bit hypocritical.</p>



<p>It’s frustrating to see Banks refuse to take accountability for her wrongdoings and have the nerve to tease a Cycle 25 that may go to less extremes but will be likely to fall into old patterns. But what’s also true is that she is the perfect scapegoat for this moment to keep us comfortable in repeating the same mistakes. There’s a regressiveness happening that we can’t ignore. Today, it’s a reality check that our favorite show perpetuated the same system it said it wanted to change. Tomorrow it’s something far more sinister. </p>

<p>When it comes to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/phantom-french-cat-eye-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">my manicure</a>, I’m pretty unadventurous. As soon as I sit down at my local salon, my nail tech knows exactly what to ask: “Your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tinted-glow-french-manicure-nails-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">usual French</a>?” And the answer is always yes. To me, a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/modern-french-manicure-nail-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">French manicure</a> — whether the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/deep-french-tips-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">classic white tip</a> or something a bit cooler, like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glass-french-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">cat-eye</a> — strikes the perfect balance between timeless and elevated, and it takes a lot to sway me from it. But the trending “reverse” French manicure might just change that. </p>



<h2>What is the reverse French manicure?  </h2>



<p>The reverse French manicure isn’t exactly new, but we have <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/iamcardib/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cardi B</a>’s Super Bowl look to thank for its recent comeback. Her nail artist, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/cocamichelle/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Coca Michelle</a>, turned the classic <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUhRw5XEaBA/?img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">French manicure on its head</a> — literally — by flipping the gold tip so it curved around the base of the nail, right at the cuticle. Since then, Google searches for “reverse French manicure” have increased by 110%, as it seems we’re ready to channel Cardi B and try something different. </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sadgirlnails/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Natalia Mercedes</a>, nail artist and founder of <a href=""https://www.sadgirlnails.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sad Girl Nails Studio</a> in New York City, is well-versed in the art of the reverse French manicure. “The reverse French is essentially a flipped take on the classic,” she explains. “Instead of highlighting the tip of the nail, the design hugs the curve of the cuticle with either a thin, delicate line or a thicker, more graphic arc,” — exactly like this beautiful set by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DT7XXe4jOtM/?hl=en"">nail artist Fern Barron</a>. </p>

<p>Mercedes adds that it draws the eye downward. “It frames the nail at its base rather than the edge, which gives it a more unexpected, editorial feel compared to the traditional French.” </p>



<p>She has an idea why it’s becoming so popular again: “It’s a twist on a timeless look, and right now clients are craving fresh ways to stay minimal without feeling boring,” she says. To Mercedes, the reverse French feels modern and intentional — subtle, yet still a statement, like this set by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/C-UWS_asnyw/?hl=en"">Fliss Alton</a>. “It’s perfect for someone who loves ‘clean’ nails but wants something more directional than a standard tip,” adds Mercedes. </p>

<h2>How do you achieve the reverse French manicure? </h2>



<p>Achieving a reverse French manicure is similar to painting a traditional French tip. It calls for the precision of a thin nail brush and a steady, skilled hand as not to flood the cuticle with polish or get any uncured gel on the skin, which could <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gel-nail-allergy"">potentially cause an allergic reaction</a>.  </p>



<p>There’s a clever benefit to reverse French nails, too, but it depends on your color choices: “If you incorporate negative space or a sheer nude at the cuticle area, the grow-out can look incredibly subtle,” says Mercedes. Because the design is already anchored at the base, she adds that it can blend more seamlessly as the nail grows. “This is especially true when softer tones are used,” she says, like nude shades. </p>

<p>Unlike the traditional French tip, the reverse French is much easier to master on shorter nails, like this set by manicurist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPvgxcACOpp/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Charlotte May</a>. We especially love the sky blue base and how the reverse French wraps around the tip slightly.</p>

<p><em>This week: a marketing manager on $167,000 and who spends some of her money on some knitting yarn.</em></p>



<p><em>This Money Diary was written in the summer of 2025.</em> <em>This is a follow-up diary. You can read the original diary </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/marketing-manager-chicago-salary-money-diary""><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>



<p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Marketing manager<br /><strong>Industry:</strong> Life sciences<br /><strong>Age:</strong> 31<br /><strong>Location:</strong> Chicago, IL<br /><strong>Salary:</strong> $167,295 ($143,295 base + $24,000 bonus)<br /><strong>Joint Income/Financial Setup:</strong> Our joint income is around ~$240,000 (+/- $10k). My husband, F., is a freelance director of photography and has recently gone back to school to facilitate a career change to healthcare.  Shortly after my first <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/marketing-manager-chicago-salary-money-diary"">Money Diary</a> we made the decision to combine our finances. It was a little challenging at first, but at the end of the day, we are a team, and we make financial decisions together. Combining finances has given us a clear picture of where we stand as a family and has allowed us to meet big financial goals like completely paying off our student loans last year. The way we manage our finances is that we plan our monthly budget off of my net income, and all money F. brings in goes into our liquid savings account. At the end of every month, we review our spending and sort everything into a spreadsheet with categories to track our spending habits and make sure we’re staying on top of our financial goals.<br /><strong>Assets</strong> <br /><strong>Home value:</strong> $275,000 <br /><strong>Car value:</strong> $20,000<br /><strong>Combined retirement accounts &amp; investments:</strong> $250,848.52<br /><strong>Checking account:</strong> $1,785<br /><strong>Savings account:</strong> $66,612.60<br /><strong>Debt:</strong> $172,600 (home loan)<br /><strong>Paycheck Amount (2x/month):</strong> $3,252 (my husband’s varies)<br /><strong>Pronouns:</strong> She/her<br /><br /><strong>Monthly Expenses</strong><br /><strong>Housing Costs:</strong> $1,742.64 ($1,368 mortgage + $374 HOA). <br /><strong>Loan Payments:</strong> $0 (we paid off student loans last year)</p>



<p><strong>All Other Monthly Expenses</strong><br />Paycheck deductions (per paycheck):<br /><strong>Health/Life Insurance:</strong> $273<br /><strong>Investments:</strong> $1460<br /><br /><strong>Recurring expenses</strong> <br /><strong>Utilities:</strong> $100<br /><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> $70<br /><strong>Gym membership for two:</strong> $154<br /><strong>Car insurance:</strong> $111<br /><strong>Mint mobile (2x lines):</strong> $53<br /><strong>Dog medication:</strong> $55<br /><br /><strong>Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?</strong><br />There was an expectation to attend college and get my bachelor’s degree. However, I strayed away from getting a degree in anything that would require higher education because I was afraid of having to take on additional debt. I paid for undergrad with a combination of student loans, settlement money from a childhood injury, and some support from my parents. My husband F. is currently pursuing a career change with plans to go to med school. Seeing him in school definitely has me toying with going back and getting an MBA. My company has tuition reimbursement programs I’m looking into.<br /><br /><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?</strong><br />I did not receive a lot of education around money growing up. My parents made a handful of bad financial decisions and got into a lot of business debt owning their own small business. Tax-advantage accounts and employer 401(k)s were totally foreign to me when I first started working, but I think we’ve done a good job building an investment portfolio given our financial backgrounds. My husband and I have done a lot to improve our financial literacy as adults and discuss our finances often.<br /><br /><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?</strong><br />My first job out of college was working as a marketing coordinator at a PR agency. I got the job because I studied communications during college and snagged a paid internship between my junior and senior years. I worked as an intern until I graduated and was offered a full-time position. I was incredibly grateful to have a job lined up on day one of post-grad. My starting salary was $38k, which is wild to think about now! At the time, I was extremely careful with how I spent my money and even managed to save some on this salary.<br /><br /><strong>Did you worry about money growing up?</strong><br />Yes — looking back it is very clear to me that my parents were striving for a life that their careers could not afford. I grew up with a lot of insecurity around money, and feared that my peers would find out about my parents’ financial struggles and think less of me. Growing up this way definitely pushed me to strive for financial security and success as an adult.<br /><br /><strong>Do you worry about money now?</strong><br />No — I am very aware that we live a life that exceeded either of our expectations and feel confident in our current financial position and trajectory. Additionally, combining our accounts pushed me to take my emotions out of finances. I also know that I’m incredibly privileged to be able to think of money as a tool that allows us to live a comfortable life.<br /><br /><strong>At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?</strong><br />I became financially responsible for myself the day I graduated college. My husband and I have built a financial safety net for ourselves through paying off loans, liquid savings, purchasing property, and investing in retirement accounts. We’ve been able to do all of this by living within our means through our 20s, and by prioritizing spending on long-term investments. <br /><br /><strong>Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.</strong><br />Yes. This past year we received a $10k gift from my grandfather. His health has declined and he is living with my parents, and sold all of his properties. The grandchildren all received a financial gift from the property sales. </p>



<h3>Day One: Monday </h3>



<p>8:00 a.m. — The temps have dropped so we are finally sleeping with the windows open but it means we had a noisier-than-usual night and didn’t get great sleep. My husband, F., makes coffee while I browse white-noise machines. I notice that they are HSA/FSA eligible so make a note to come back for my purchase. </p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — I boot up my computer for the week and check in with co-workers before I get ready to take the dog, P., around the block. I listen to my audiobook, <em>Darling Girls</em>, while I walk P. around the block. I love listening to audiobooks and love that you get 10 hours of listening included in your monthly Spotify Premium subscription! </p>



<p>9:00 a.m. — I join my weekly round robin all-hands call as F. heads out for a job. My co-worker has the updates for my team this week so I just listen in while all teams give their updates and priorities for the week. </p>



<p>9:30 a.m. — Next meeting of the morning! I hop on a call with all the product marketers on my team and we discuss what we’re working on this week. For me, it’s a few housekeeping tasks and a little bit of planning for future projects. I just wrapped up managing a big project and my manager is on paternity leave for the next two weeks, so it’ll probably be a pretty slow week for me work-wise. </p>



<p>10:00 a.m. — It’s time for breakfast! I take a break and listen to my audio book while I make myself eggs, toast, and a fruit bowl.</p>



<p>10:15 a.m. — My co-worker calls me asking for help with something. We also catch up and chat about what’s been going on in our lives since we last connected, and I eat my breakfast. </p>



<p>10:30 a.m. — I spend the rest of the morning working on the task my co-worker and I chatted about. </p>



<p>1:00 p.m. — I break for lunch and whip up a quick bowl of tuna salad. While I’m on my lunch break I scroll through Ravelry looking for a pattern to use up some extra yarn I have from a baby sweater project. A year ago, I really got into knitting and haven’t stopped since I picked up knitting needles for the first time. I purchase a small neck scarf pattern called the <a href=""https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/my-jose-scarf"">My Jose Scarf</a>. I cast on the project and knit a few stitches before logging back in for work. <strong>$8.20</strong></p>



<p>3:00 p.m — Work is slowing down for the day so I decide to get a head start on dinner. F. and I have evening commitments so I’m hoping this will get dinner on the table faster. Dinner tonight is <a href=""https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020419-pasta-alla-norma-sorta"">Pasta Alla Norma Sorta</a> from NYT Cooking. F. comes home from his job and we catch up for a few minutes in the kitchen.</p>



<p>4:45 p.m. — I check my emails and Teams messages before riding my bike to group tennis lessons from 5-6 (I prepaid for the session a few weeks ago but it’s typically $259 for 8x 60-minute lessons). I started taking tennis lessons last March and have fallen completely in love with the sport! I’m still very much a beginner tennis player, but I’ve signed up for my first ladies’ tennis league this fall. Expectations of winning are low, but I’m still planning on having fun!</p>



<p>6:15 p.m. — Back from tennis and F. is already settled into his online chemistry class. I check emails and Teams once more before logging off for the day and taking a shower. I’m grateful my past self did all the dinner prep. All that’s left to do is heat and assemble. I finish listening to my audiobook while I get dinner together. </p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — F. has a break from his online class so we eat dinner together for a few minutes. F. recently decided on a career change and is finishing up some pre-reqs on online community college. The plan is to take the MCAT after this and then apply for med school (big life change)! After dinner, I clean up the kitchen, and walk P. once more before relaxing with my knitting project and watching reality TV for the rest of the evening. </p>



<p>10:00 p.m. — We get ready for bed and read for a little while before falling asleep. F. is reading his chemistry textbook and I’m reading<em> Fates and Furies</em> by Lauren Groff.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $8.20</strong></p>



<h3>Day Two: Tuesday </h3>



<p>6:30 a.m. — We wake up early today since F. has a job, so he needs to head out the door early this morning. F. makes coffee as I work through the NYT Games for the day. The Wordle really stumps me!</p>



<p>8:00 a.m. — I check in on my emails and check off a task for the day. F. heads out the door and I follow behind with P. I call my mom and catch up while I walk the dog. My mom lets me know that they are coming up to Chicago for Thanksgiving and this puts me in a good mood. Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday and I love to host!</p>



<p>9:00 a.m. — I’m back online for work for the rest of the morning. I get a CC alert that $20 has been reloaded on the city street parking account. F. must have arrived at his job (this is a work expense and we will get reimbursed from the client). I take a quick break to make breakfast and eat in front of my computer while responding to emails.</p>



<p>12:00 p.m. — During my lunch break I go to the public tennis courts near our condo and practice my serve for a while. As a beginner tennis player, serves are 100% the hardest skill to learn!</p>



<p>1:00 p.m. — On the way home from the courts I stop at my neighborhood market and grab a bell pepper, turkey, iceberg lettuce, olives, mozzarella, and black olives to make a chopped salad for lunch. <strong>$22.05</strong></p>



<p>1:15 p.m. — When I get home I throw together my lunch salad and settle in for work for the rest of the afternoon. F. gets home from his job around 3 p.m. and makes salad with the ingredients I bought. </p>



<p>4:00 p.m. — I get an email that my tennis league didn’t have enough people sign up for the bracket and is being cancelled and refunded. I end up signing up for Gladiator Tennis, which I’ve heard of players using for league play. After my serve practice, I’m feeling hopeful I won’t totally embarrass myself and sign up for the beginner/intermediate league. <strong>$35</strong></p>



<p>6:00 p.m. — The rest of the afternoon was spent working from the couch. I got my period and was majorly knocked down by cramps and PMS. F is already in class so I peel myself off the couch to walk P. around the block. </p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — Dinner is leftovers from yesterday. F. eats while he’s in online class and I eat while watching TV. I feel a little guilty about being so lazy this evening while F. is being productive in school. </p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — F. wraps up class early so we walk P. around the neighborhood one more time, and then come home and wind down watching PBS before getting ready for bed. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $57.05</strong></p>



<h3>Day Three: Wednesday </h3>



<p>8:00 a.m. — We wake up and F. makes coffee while I play the NYT Games for the day and work on a few rows of knitting. F. talks about going to the gym this morning and I tell him I might come, too.</p>



<p>9:00 a.m. — I log onto my computer to get started on work for the day. The last week of August is usually my slowest week of the year, so there isn’t a whole lot I need to be doing for the rest of the week. As a “high earner” with a WFH job, I feel a lot of guilt/shame around slow periods. November through July is generally very busy and then it slows down for a few months. </p>



<p>10:00 a.m. — We take P. around the block and then head to the gym. I put on a spooky podcast when I get to the gym and do a leg workout. </p>



<p>11:15 a.m. — F. makes eggs, toast, and fruit for us for breakfast when we get home and I do a little bit of work on my laptop. </p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — I hop on a call to discuss landing pages that are being built for an upcoming campaign I’m managing. I often work with and project manage the digital and content teams and feel grateful that they’re a nice bunch of people to work with. We all give feedback and talk through some options for the Q4 campaign I’m leading.</p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — After my meeting, I take a quick little snack break and have some honey roasted almonds and remind myself to drink a glass of water. F. sees I’m up from my desk and also takes a study/snack break. We talk about going to Key West for his spring break in March. We’ve never been to Key West and we’ve never taken a spring break before. I send F. a few links to the Key West Historic Inns once I’m back at my desk.</p>



<p>3:15 p.m. — Work is wrapping for the day and I get a jump start on dinner since F. and I will be out for the evening. Tonight’s dinner is <a href=""https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1025436-one-pot-chicken-and-rice-with-caramelized-lemon"">chicken and rice from NYTimes Cooking</a>. </p>



<p>3:30 p.m. — While the chicken and rice is in the oven, I take P. out for a walk and clean up the kitchen a bit. F. and I sit down for an early dinner before getting ready to head out. After dinner, F. drops me off at tennis on his way to night class. One night a week he’s in person for a lab.</p>



<p>6:00 p.m. — After tennis, my friend and I grab a drink at a wine bar in our neighborhood and cheers to playing well during class! <strong>$28.25</strong></p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — I enjoy a nice late summer walk home through the neighborhood. August is the sweetest month of all and I always feel such a warm, fuzzy feeling walking around this time of year. I’m sure the wine was helping perpetuate this feeling!</p>



<p>8:15 p.m. — Home from tennis and I take an ‘everything shower’ before making a yogurt bowl and chilling with my knitting project while watching <em>Southern Charm</em>. I was turned on to <em>Southern Charm</em> after watching the latest season of <em>The White Lotus</em>. F. gets home around 9:30 p.m. and he fills me in on his first day of in-person class, and we hang out for a bit before getting ready for bed.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $28.25</strong></p>



<h3>Day Four: Thursday</h3>



<p>7:30 a.m. — I wake up and get ready quickly for my first meeting of the day. </p>



<p>8:00 a.m. — I meet with a colleague in Europe and we discuss projects we’re collaborating on. F. makes coffee in the kitchen and we drink our coffee together after I wrap up my meeting. </p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — F. asks if I ordered the sound machine yet (I haven’t). We decide on an old school fan-based sound machine. I get started on a little bit of work and message with one of my coworkers about a final report for a project we’re wrapping up. <strong>$60.63</strong></p>



<p>10:00 a.m. — F. gets ready for the gym and I get ready to take the dog on a walk. I walk F. to the gym and then stop at a local cafe for a breakfast sandwich before heading home and getting back to work. <strong>$14.79</strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — F. has been working on his chemistry homework all morning. Weirdly, the chem textbook does not come with an answer guide to check your work, so he purchases a used solutions manual to help him with studying. <strong>$27.44</strong></p>



<p>1:00 p.m. — I have my weekly check-ins with two of my co-workers. We all agree it’s been such a slow week but also nice to come up for air after our busy season this summer. </p>



<p>3:00 p.m. — I have a psychiatrist appointment to check in on the anxiety medication I’m taking. I had a really scary panic attack where I ended up in the emergency room earlier this year so I have 100% been prioritizing my mental health. Anxiety is something I’ve struggled with since I was a kid and this year I feel like I’m finally taking the steps for treatment. Because I’ve hit my out of pocket max for the year, my co-pay is $0. </p>



<p>3:45 p.m. — I stop for gas and at Whole Foods on my way home to pick up magnesium glycate (recommended by my psych for sleep) and a very balanced snack of cheese balls and a protein drink. I also grab some sugar that’ll I need for the baking project I’m working on this weekend. <strong>$73.25</strong></p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — I wrap up work for the week and throw together a quick dinner of rice leftovers, broccoli, and shrimp from the freezer for F. and I to have before he has class, and I head out for my evening activity. </p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — Every Thursday, my local knitting shop has a ‘knit circle’. This is the shop where I learned to knit a year ago and I really enjoy the community space they’ve built. I haven’t been to knit night all summer so I make sure to bring a few of my finished objects to share. Vibes are great and I promise to myself I’ll be back again next week. </p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — Home and snacking on the rest of the cheese balls while I watch TV and knit and F. finishes with his online class. Once he’s done, we catch up and get ready for bed. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $176.11</strong></p>



<h3>Day Five: Friday </h3>



<p>8:00 a.m. — I have the day off so F. and I wake up a little later. I don’t know if it’s a placebo, but I did sleep a lot better last night after taking the magnesium! F. and I have sex before getting out of bed and making coffee. </p>



<p>10:00 a.m. — F. and I meet up with one of my friends to play some two-on-one. We play for about an hour and a half and it’s so much fun. I love the endorphins I get from playing tennis. </p>



<p>12:00 p.m. — Home from tennis and we have some breakfast. After knit night, I’m feeling inspired to order the boucle yarn I need to start a pattern I bought months ago. I also buy an extra skein of yarn for the scarf project I’m working on since it looks like I’m going to lose a game of yarn chicken. <strong>$165.15</strong></p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — I shower and get ready to go to therapy. I go every other week, and to be honest, I find talk therapy a little bit tedious and exhausting but I go on the recommendation of my psychiatrist. I have to take the train because F. is about to head out of town for the weekend for a film festival. F. will be staying at his parents’ place and any expenses incurred, i.e. meals, etc., this weekend are business write-offs. </p>



<p>2:00 p.m. — Once I get to the office I realize I messed up the dates and I actually don’t have therapy until next week — whoops! Instead of therapy, I take a long walk through the neighborhood and stop at a few shops. I pick up three birthday cards and a baby card at Hazel — they have the best selection of cards. <strong>$25.91</strong></p>



<p>2:30 p.m. — I make a few more shopping stops on my way home. Next stop is a local apothecary to pick up Ilia Limitless Lash Mascara. I also stop at the running store to pick up energy snacks for some of the tennis meetups and matches I have. Last stop is the grocery store to pick up a few ingredients for lunch, and baking ingredients to do a practice run of my friend’s wedding cake I’m making in September. <strong>$77.62</strong></p>



<p>5:00 p.m. — After the impromptu shopping afternoon, I come home and made a Costco frozen pizza. While the oven pre-heats and the pizza cooks I eat the broccoli leftovers from last night. I relax on the couch for a while before taking P. on a long walk. F. ended up taking the toll roads to Michigan since the holiday weekend traffic was looking bad. <strong>$17.10</strong> <strong>(tolls). </strong></p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — I spend a majority of the evening working on a practice cake for my friend’s wedding next month. The recipe I’m using is Claire Saffitz’s confetti cake — it’s such a good recipe and is my go-to for the foster care birthday cakes I make volunteering. </p>



<p>9:30 p.m. — Cake baking goes well but at this point I’ve made two failed attempts at marshmallow buttercream. I clean up the kitchen and decide that frosting the cake is a tomorrow task. I relax and watch TV while knitting the rest of the evening. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $285.78</strong></p>



<h3>Day Six: Saturday </h3>



<p>8:00 a.m. — P. wakes me up with a wet nose in the face and we snuggle in bed while I do the NYTimes Games. After this I get up and make a latte —still using the Breville Espresso Maker! While I drink my coffee, I crack open the holy grail cake cookbook, <em>The Cake Bible</em> by Rose Levy Beranbaum and scour the buttercream recipes until I find one that sounds like it will go well with the confetti cake. </p>



<p>9:00 a.m. — I have a 10 a.m. tennis meet-up so I take P. around the block and make a quick breaky of scrambled eggs and fruit. Then I get ready and put a backpack together with my racket, waterbottle, knitting, and a book. I’m not going to go home right away after tennis. </p>



<p>9:50 a.m. — I hop on my bike and arrive a few minutes early, hoping to snag a court, which I do! My tennis partner and I warm up and play a set. I lose 2-6, but still have fun and felt good about my serves. </p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — First stop of the day after tennis is Loba. I get a housemade melon soda and a strawberry sourdough muffin. I settle in at a table to work on my knitting and start listening to a new audiobook, <em>Don’t Let Him In</em>. Coincidentally, the two gals next to me were also knitting and we share a moment talking about what we’re working on. The knitting community is alive and well in Chicago! <strong>$14.15</strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — Next stop is Paulina Meat Market to grab an Italian sub. I’m back on my bike headed towards the lake to enjoy my sandwich, and a little more knitting while I listen to the audiobook. <strong>$13.78</strong></p>



<p>2:00 p.m. — I don’t have enough butter in the fridge to do the meringue buttercream recipe so I stop at the local market on the way home and buy more butter. It kills me to buy butter at this price so I make a mental note to stock up at Costco next time. <strong>$6.64</strong></p>



<p>2:15 p.m. — P. greets me at the door and I get straight to work prepping all the ingredients for the butter cream. All goes well with the new buttercream recipe and I finish up with the cake project for the weekend. </p>



<p>4:30 p.m. — I take P. for a long walk to the river before the sun goes down. When I get home, I take a shower, clean up the kitchen and make tacos for dinner. </p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — I try a slice of the cake I made and it’s heavenly — can’t wait to bring some to my friend tomorrow morning! The rest of the night is spent working on my knitting project and watching <em>Southern Charm</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $34.57</strong></p>



<h3>Day Seven: Sunday</h3>



<p>8:00 a.m. — P. wakes me up again and we snuggle in bed while I play the daily NYTimes Games. </p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — I make a latte and watch <em>Sunday Morning</em> while working on some knitting. After this, I walk P., have some breakfast, and get ready to meet up with a friend for tennis. </p>



<p>10:00 a.m. — We don’t have to wait long for an open court, thankfully! My friend and I have a nice long warm-up and then play a match. I get my a** handed to me and lose 6-0, 6-0. I still have fun and score a few points and remind myself the only way to get better is to keep playing!</p>



<p>12:00 p.m. — After tennis, I go home, take a shower, and get the laundry for the week started. Our condo building doesn’t have in-unit hook-ups, so we’re still using coin-operated in the basement. It’s not glamorous but it gets the job done. <strong>$4.50</strong></p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — F. is home from his weekend away and I’m starving for lunch! We go on a long walk through the neighborhood and get sandwiches and Diet Cokes at L&amp;M, which we eat in the park and catch each other up on our weekends. <strong>$37.42</strong></p>



<p>3:30 p.m. — When we get home from lunch we have some of the cake I made yesterday. F. gives his best Paul Hollywood critique. The rest of the afternoon is spent working on knitting projects and watching TV. I’m pretty tired from the two hours of tennis. F. takes a nap and works on his chemistry homework for a bit. </p>



<p>6:00 p.m. — F. and I walk P. around the block. When we get home we open a bottle of wine and have the tacos from yesterday for dinner. We chat for a bit before F. resumes his chem homework and I get back to knitting. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $41.92</strong></p>

For virtually all of my teen years, I blasted my face with salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide — anything that claimed to target acne, I slathered with reckless abandon. It wasn't until my 20s that I finally put down the harsh products and picked up gentler ones that targeted breakouts without the slash-and-burn-farming approach — this is how I discovered <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/niacinamide-for-skin"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">niacinamide</a>. <br /> <br />If you ask me, niacinamide (a form of vitamin B3) is well-deserving of its hype, and it’s not unusual to see it laced into not only skincare products, by makeup primers, skin tints, and foundations nowadays. The ingredient is often name-checked by dermatologists for its multifaceted benefits: curbing excess oil, minimizing the appearance of large pores and fine lines, and soothing flare-ups due to inflammation or acne.  <br /> <br />“Niacinamide works by modulating inflammation and supporting the skin barrier, which is especially important for acne-prone and reactive skin,” explains dermatologist Jenna Queller, MD. She adds, “It also helps regulate sebum production [natural oils produced by the skin], reduce the transfer of pigment within the skin, and improve skin elasticity, contributing to brighter, more even-toned skin over time.” In other words, it's an all-in-one skincare ingredient with near-universal appeal. <br /> <br />Ahead, I've rounded up some of my favorite products that include the star ingredient — from niacinamide cleansers to serums to moisturizers. <br /> <br /><em>At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.

/>I've been using this stuff on repeat for a few reasons. For starters, the price is right, and for an acne cleanser, it's not over-stripping, thanks to CeraVe’s signature ceramide complex and hyaluronic acid. Plus, it works wonders to ward off new breakouts, thanks to antibacterial salicylic acid, which also exfoliates deeply but gently, preventing clogged pores, not to mention niacinamide to mop up oil and boost the skin barrier.  <br /><br /><strong>CeraVe</strong> Renewing SA Cleanser, $, available at <a

/><figcaption><h2>Naturium Niacinamide Cleansing Gelée 3%</h2><br />If a hydrating essence and a gel cleanser had a baby, this would be it. You can apply it as the first step in a double cleanse to remove makeup, or on wet skin to whisk away dirt and oil, leaving behind a bright, balanced complexion. In addition to niacinamide, this formula contains sodium hyaluronate (a form of hyaluronic acid), plus sodium ascorbyl phosphate, a water-soluble, stable form of vitamin C. <br /><br /><strong>Naturium</strong> Niacinamide Cleansing Gelée 3%, $, available at <a

Essence<br /></h2><br />Then I Met You (founded by Charlotte Cho, the brains behind K-beauty retailer Soko Glam) has been something of a best-kept secret — until now. This hydrating, brightening essence contains yeast-derived galactomyces ferment filtrate and saccharomyces ferment filtrate to reduce the appearance of large pores and curb sebum. (TL;DR fermented skin care ingredients tend to be more effective and are easily absorbed by the skin thanks to the molecules being much smaller.) Besides these smart ingredients, it contains a 5% concentration of niacinamide to brighten and soothe skin. <br /><br /><strong>Then I Met You</strong> The Giving Essence, $, available at <a

Serum<br /></h2><br />Eadem’s Milk Marvel Serum is uniquely formulated by and for people with melanin-rich skin, meaning that it targets excess pigment without lightening or bleaching your overall skin tone. Niacinamide is a key ingredient in the formula, along with papaya and pineapple enzymes, to target concerns like dullness and hyperpigmentation at the source.  <br /><br

Cin Niacinamide Face Serum<br /></h2><br />Dr. Queller recommends this gentle yet effective formula for its pairing of niacinamide with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, zinc PCA, and aloe

<p>I started <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/summer-fridays-flushed-lip-stain-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">wearing makeup</a> at 13, but I can count on one hand the lipsticks I’ve used all the way to the last swipe.

I want my lipstick to feel moisturizing on my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-peptide-lip-treatment-balm"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">chronically dry lips</a>, stay where I put it without ending up on my teeth, lend a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/blur-makeup-trend-products"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">soft, blurred, diffused effect</a>, and not break the bank entirely. That’s exactly why I’ve fallen head over heels for <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Merit’s Signature Lip Blush</a>. </p>



<h2>What is Merit’s Signature Lip Blush and what are the benefits? </h2>



<p><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Signature Lip Blush</a> is the latest addition to Merit’s growing lip lineup. You might know — and love — its <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/merit-beauty-products-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Signature Lipstick,</a> which occupies a cozy space between matte and glossy, giving lips a subtle satin-like glint. Or perhaps the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/merit-beauty-products-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shade Slick lip oil</a> is a staple in your handbag. <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"">Signature Lip Blush</a>, however, dials the shine all the way back. </p>



<p>Merit describes <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"">Signature Lip Blush</a> as a “sheer matte lightweight, buildable formula with a comfortable, balm-like feel”. To me, it’s a soft matte lipstick that’s not too dissimilar from a lip stain — packed with pigment — or a lip pencil, which you can diffuse with your fingers or a brush.  </p>



<p>If you’re just as obsessed as I am with celebrity makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ninapark/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nina Park</a>, specifically the way she makes her clients’ lips appear contoured, plump, and diffused, then I have a feeling you’re going to love this lipstick. On application, it’s sheer and light enough to blend outward, but unlike others with a similar texture, once it dries down a little, it clings to lips for a good four hours without disappearing into nothingness. </p>



<p>That’s all down to what Merit calls gel-wrapped pigments — essentially molecules of color encapsulated in a gel-like texture that makes swiping and blending easy. Speaking of color, there are eight shades in total, spanning Andie (a delicate petal pink) to Gamay (a deep red wine). Here, I’m wearing September, a muted terracotta, paired with Merit’s <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-liner%3F_pos%3D1%26_psq%3DSignature%2BLip%2BLiner%26_ss%3De%26_v%3D1.0"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Signature Lip Liner in Mayfair,</a> a peachy mauve. I will say the lipstick bullet appears a little darker than it does on the lips.</p>

<h2>What makes Merit’s Signature Lip Blush Special? </h2>



<p>What sets <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"">Merit’s Signature Lip Blush</a> apart from other soft matte lipsticks is how it feels on. Most matte products dry out my parched lips even further, settling into — and accentuating — lines and creases. This one feels so comforting, it’s like wearing a lip balm — all without any stickiness. You can thank sesame seed extract, nourishing olive oil, and plant-based waxes for that. </p>



<p>I judge makeup first and foremost on how it makes me feel, but when others notice, it’s affirming. Since giving <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"">Signature Lip Blush</a> a trial run these past few weeks, I’ve had countless compliments on my lipstick, with beauty editor peers repeatedly asking what I’m wearing — we’re convinced it makes my lips appear bigger. </p>



<h2>What to know about Merit’s Signature Lip Blush:</h2>



<p>• Sheer, matte lipstick with a moisturizing balm-like feel. </p>



<p>• Available in eight shades from rose brown through to bordeaux.  </p>



<p>•  Lends a diffused, blurred finish to lips and stays put for hours. </p>



<h2>How do you use Merit’s Signature Lip Blush? </h2>



<p>Because <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Signature Lip Blush</a> is so balm-like, I don’t have to be precise when I apply it. Usually, I line my lips and even use a lip brush before any lipstick, but with this, I can swipe it on haphazardly — without a mirror — and still end up with perfect, pillowy lips. Maybe that’s the blurred-lip trend talking, but the texture makes it so easy. </p>



<p>If you’re applying it a little more thoughtfully, it looks even better paired with a darker lip pencil and blurred ever so slightly over the lines, again lending that Nina Park effect. I love that the lipstick bullet boasts a squoval shape, which makes light work of tracing your lip line if you don’t have a lip pencil to hand. </p>



<p>Ultimately, this is the perfect lipstick for lipstick skeptics and obsessives alike — low-maintenance, wearable, and hard to mess up. I currently have three in my handbag.</p>
