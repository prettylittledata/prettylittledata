Several huge trees in the west of the site can reduce indoor energy consumption in hot summer, which creates favorable conditions for the design of large-area glass floor-to-ceiling windows. The lower terrain in the northeast of the building can be seen by tea gardens and villages in the distance.</p>",

We’ve memorized that “normal text” (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html#dfn-large-scale"">24 CSS pixels and below</a>) needs to meet a 4.5:1 contrast ratio with its background, and “large text” (greater than 24 CSS pixels) needs to meet a 3:1 ratio.</p><p><strong>But WCAG (</strong><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/""><strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</strong></a><strong>) color contrast requirements don’t stop at text.</strong> There are lesser known WCAG success criteria (or “rules”) that are still very important for inclusive design; these ensure interfaces are usable to users with low vision or color blindness.</p><figure><img alt=""Viewing YouTube’s homepage with different vision simulations, like red-green color blindness and sun-glare"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-l5gevfqLDE88Ha5TisA6g.png"" /><figcaption>Viewing YouTube’s homepage with different vision simulations, like red-green color blindness</figcaption></figure><p>Some of these forgotten requirements circle around UI components, inline links, and data visualizations, which all have color contrast rules of their own. When these details are overlooked, users can’t tell what’s interactive, what’s linked, or what the data is actually saying (even if all the text uses accessible colors).</p><p>And these accessibility gaps aren’t edge cases. They show up in mature Design Systems, enterprise products, and well-intentioned designs because they live outside the accessibility standards designers tend to learn and adopt.</p><p>To avoid these gaps for the future, let’s go over 3 ongoing color contrast issues, how WCAG applies beyond text, and who exactly is impacted by color contrast.</p><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: I reference WCAG 2.1, Level AA standards. If your product needs to comply with Level AAA, required color contrast ratios increase (i.e., </em><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-enhanced.html""><em>normal text needs a 7:1 ratio</em></a><em> with its background).</em></blockquote><h3>UI components that look accessible (but aren’t)</h3><p>WCAG criteria: <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html"">SC 1.4.11: Non-Text Contrast (Level AA)</a></p><p>In plain english, this WCAG criteria requires that non-text UI elements that are interactive or communicate meaning have a <strong>minimum of 3:1 contrast ratio</strong> against adjacent colors (like the UI background).</p><p>But what is covered by “UI elements”? Basically, anything that a user can interact with or needs to see to use; such as:</p><ul><li>Buttons and button states</li><li>Form fields and their borders</li><li>Checkboxes, radio buttons, and toggles</li><li>Focus indicators</li><li>Icons that convey meaning or affordance</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Spirit includes text fields that do not meet contrast requirements with a 1.6:1 ratio"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mzlbjZWOHK27EOSS3N1QaQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.spirit.com/flight-status""><em>Spirit</em></a><em> includes text fields that do not meet contrast requirements with a 1.6:1 ratio; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong>Important note</strong><em>: If color contrast fails WCAG standards from the Design System level, the failure is replicated across all product adopters; it’s critical to check system UI component’s color contrast.</em></blockquote><h4>What designers miss and why it matters</h4><p>This is where many designs that are intended to be accessible quietly fail. Since these UI elements don’t contain text, they’re excluded from color contrast checks. And yes, text is very important to check, but so are the UI elements that provide any product its functionality.</p><p><strong>Common gaps within UI elements include:</strong></p><ul><li>Input borders that blend into the product background</li><li>Custom focus indicators that rely on subtle color shifts instead of high-contrast</li><li>Icon-only controls (like buttons) that don’t meet contrast on their own</li></ul><p><strong>When UI elements lack minimum contrast, users can’t reliably:</strong></p><ul><li>Identify what’s interactive or understand UI component states (like hover)</li><li>Navigate interfaces using only their keyboard</li><li>Complete forms without repetitive errors</li></ul><figure><img alt=""BBC includes a primary CTA that meets contrast requirements with a 4.58:1 ratio"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9lBpa8t8UhfH8HfsgOkvOQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.bbc.com/""><em>BBC</em></a><em> includes a primary CTA that meets contrast requirements with a 4.58:1 ratio; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><h4>Who are the users impacted?</h4><p>Though low-contrast UI elements affect everyone at some capacity (you might have to do some squinting), they make products unusable to people like:</p><ul><li>Users with low vision who need distinct visual styling</li><li>Keyboard users who depend on focus indicators that stand-out on the UI</li><li>Older users experiencing reduced contrast sensitivity</li><li>Users in low-contrast environments (i.e., sun-glare, small screens, fluorescent lights)</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: To check a UI component’s contrast (or any element that needs contrast), you can also use </em><a href=""https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-disability-simulator/olioanlbgbpmdlgjnnampnnlohigkjla?hl=en&amp;pli=1""><em>Web Disability Simulator</em></a><em> on any web page to simulate how it looks for users with color-blindness or cognitive disabilities.</em></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Red-green color blind simulation on YouTube with the Web Disability Simulator Chrome extension"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QWZyIWC5rf7neuUBx-RhKQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Red-green color blind simulation on </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/""><em>YouTube</em></a><em> with the </em><a href=""https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-disability-simulator/olioanlbgbpmdlgjnnampnnlohigkjla?hl=en&amp;pli=1""><em>Web Disability Simulator</em></a><em> Chrome extension</em></figcaption></figure><h3>Data visualizations with low contrast</h3><p>WCAG criteria: <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html"">SC 1.4.11: Non-Text Contrast (Level AA)</a></p><p>This accessibility gap references the same WCAG standard as UI components from above. But though data visualizations (data viz) may not always be interactive, they’re communicating meaningful information. Because of this, data viz must be perceivable without relying only on color and must meet a <strong>minimum 3:1 contrast ratio</strong> against adjacent colors.</p><p>This standard applies to:</p><ul><li>Chart lines, bars, and segments</li><li>Data points and markers</li><li>Axes, gridlines, or any reference lines that convey meaning</li><li>Legends or other visual keys</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Datylon includes a pie chart example that does not meet contrast requirements with a 1:1 ratio"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1OTh5HfA1C-vKeF7ZsJWag.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.datylon.com/resources/chart-library/pie-chart""><em>Datylon</em></a><em> includes a pie chart example that does not meet contrast requirements with a 1:1 ratio; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><h4>What designers miss and why it matters</h4><p>Data viz is an already complex and complicated UI element, so it’s even more difficult to bake in accessibility guidelines (especially if it’s being retrofitted). But color contrast issues are frequently found in charts and heatmaps that use the brand’s color palette rather than accessibility-tested colors.</p><p><strong>Common issues with data viz include:</strong></p><ul><li>Chart colors that are distinguishable in isolation but fail 3:1 contrast when touching one another</li><li>Data series using colors that aren’t distinguishable for color-blind users (i.e., red-green)</li><li>Thin gridlines with low contrast that disappear against the background</li><li>Charts that use multiple colors without secondary text indicators</li><li>Legends that depend on matching colors instead of labels or patterns</li></ul><p><strong>When data viz lack contrast and use color alone, users can’t:</strong></p><ul><li>Clearly and quickly understand trends in the data set</li><li>Confidently compare data without the feeling of guessing</li><li>Lose access to critical insights (especially when the data isn’t provided in another way)</li></ul><h4>Who are the users impacted?</h4><p>Again, all users are affected on some level by low contrast data viz. But other users need to be considered when designing the different types of charts so they can perceive and comprehend the same information as everyone else.</p><p>Some of these users include:</p><ul><li>Color-blind users (especially those with red-green color blindness)</li><li>Users with low vision who need high contrast for visual distinction</li><li>Users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from redundant cues</li><li>Users viewing charts on small screens or in poor lighting</li></ul><figure><img alt=""IBM Carbon includes a pie chart example that meets contrast requirements with a 7.76:1 ratio"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_Gsff7Yx_6gvh6DmjX7Djg.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://carbondesignsystem.com/data-visualization/simple-charts/#pie""><em>IBM Carbon</em></a><em> includes a pie chart example that meets contrast requirements with a 7.76:1 ratio; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: Simply by adding a white border between data viz elements, the colors become more distinguishable and meet accessibility guidelines.</em></blockquote><h3>Inline links that rely on low contrast color</h3><p>WCAG criteria: <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color.html"">SC 1.4.1: Use of Color (Level A)</a></p><p>Color cannot be the only visual means used to indicate a link on a web page. But not only that, inline links also must have <strong>at least 3:1 contrast</strong> against surrounding body text to be distinguishable (especially when the link doesn’t have an additional visual cue, <a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/F73.html"">like an underline or bold font weight</a>).</p><figure><img alt=""Atlanta’s Department of Transportation includes inline links that do not meet contrast requirements with a 1.58:1 ratio"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*k_84e7wKBM0IOAXis1ljeA.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://atldot.atlantaga.gov/""><em>Atlanta’s Department of Transportation</em></a><em> includes inline links that do not meet contrast requirements with a 1.58:1 ratio; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><h4>What designers miss and why it matters</h4><p>Inline links are such simple and subtle UI components; it’s easy to miss the checks needed to ensure accessibility. Designers typically think that since a paragraph of text meets the 4.5:1 color ratio requirement, any inline link using the same text color within the paragraph also passes. Since links are interactive elements, they have additional guidelines other than passing the color requirements for text.</p><p><strong>Frequent issues with inline links include:</strong></p><ul><li>Links that are differentiated only by an underline when the link receive mouse hover or keyboard focus</li><li>Link colors that meet contrast against the background, but not against adjacent text</li><li>Underlines removed for aesthetic or simplicity reasons</li></ul><p><strong>When inline links aren’t clearly distinguishable, users can’t:</strong></p><ul><li>Easily comprehend what’s interactive (especially when hidden in body copy)</li><li>Efficiently navigate a website or product page</li><li>Find important actions or information they need to complete a task</li></ul><h4>Who are the users impacted?</h4><p>I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again… this affects all users at some capacity. Inline links are not as recognizable to any user when the underline affordance or high contrast color is taken away. But for some users, it becomes impossible to identify links that could lead the user to information or product pages they need.</p><p>Users to consider when designing inline links include:</p><ul><li>Color-blind users who may not perceive color differences</li><li>Users with low vision who require visual affordances with high contrast</li><li>Users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from consistent patterns</li><li>All users scanning content quickly</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: A simple rule of thumb is to make a link look like a link for optimal usability and accessibility.</em></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Gov.UK includes inline links that meets contrast requirements with a 3.81:1 ratio AND are underlined"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3rOPtaAXaJBwGlfl3wKXcg.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid""><em>Gov.UK</em></a><em> includes inline links that meets contrast requirements with a 3.81:1 ratio AND are underlined; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>UI components, inline links, and data visualizations often fall outside the mental checklist of color contrast and accessible design.</strong> WCAG covers these elements, but it’s often overlooked when focusing on adequate contrast for text. This leads to websites and interfaces that look high contrast, but are near impossible to use for some user groups.</p><p>By spreading awareness to these accessibility gaps, we can expand how we define color contrast and better apply ideal accessibility practices. When these requirements are built into components, patterns, and Design Systems from the start, accessibility stops being a last-minute fix (or remediation plan) and becomes part of the design process.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=68cc224735b3"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/3-color-contrast-mistakes-designers-still-make-68cc224735b3"">3 color contrast mistakes designers still make</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Our brain is a prediction machine that can’t be stopped. No matter how hard we try, it will still build expectations.</h4><p>If you’re reading this, you’ve probably asked yourself the same question I always have: What exactly makes users subconsciously follow <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279871278_Color-in-Context_Theory"">Color Psychology</a>, <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles?srsltid=AfmBOopi3ws2HhTLq5t9k-4j8DcE9Ef_W6XddNvGAqidJSuDQZDW4XU4"">Gestalt principles</a>, and behavioral patterns like <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/hicks-law/"">Hick’s law</a>? Why does all of this work? Is there a way to understand the true nature of our brain and not just how it reacts, but why it predicts, expects, and perceives the world the way it does?</p><p>Now it’s time to go one level deeper — into the core of how our brain actually works. In this article, we’ll touch on one of the fundamental theories that helps me personally answer these questions, and I would love to share it with you. Buckle up, we’re shifting into nerd gear!</p><h3>The Free Energy Principle</h3><p>In 2010, in his paper <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2787"">The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_J._Friston"">Karl Friston</a> formally introduced a theory stating that every system, including living organisms, strives to minimize free energy. Simple enough: we don’t like surprises. But let’s take a closer look at what that really means.</p><figure><img alt=""Portrait of neuroscientist Karl Friston, author of the Free Energy Principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*SSE0hdbj4PtpTqh7.jpg"" /><figcaption>Karl Friston, Photo by Kate Peters (<a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/karl-friston-free-energy-principle-artificial-intelligence/"">WIRED</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The brain’s main task is to minimize the gap between expectation and reality. This gap is what the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle"">Free Energy Principle</a> defines as free energy. When the brain encounters unpredictable input, its stress level rises. And it’s crucial to understand: this isn’t about you as a person or a “user”, it’s about your brain. It’s not something we consciously control, but it’s something we can use.</p><p>After all, as humans, we don’t always chase predictability or comfort. Many people enjoy physical exercise, even though it’s technically stress for the muscles. We love movies with unexpected plot twists, and even comedy works by placing us in a familiar setup and then adding an unpredictable punchline.</p><p>That’s because we’re more than just our brains. The human organism and our consciousness is a complex system of subsystems, including our hormonal system, which can reward the brain with the right chemistry under stress, or reinforce behavior when we act in line with its internal “program.”</p><p>So, the Free Energy Principle is actually quite a complex theory, and there are different mathematical interpretations of it. But for simplicity and convenience, today we’re going to look at a more accessible formula:</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram of the free energy equation with each variable labeled."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OltXx93fAkWg9_8i2HvACw.png"" /></figure><p>We can break it down into several key variables:</p><ul><li><strong><em>F</em> </strong>— variational free energy: this is the result of our brain’s calculations. For the brain (or any predictive system) to remain in a stable, low-stress state, F should approach zero. The higher the free energy, the greater the stress or uncertainty in the system. This idea directly connects to the concept of entropy, the natural tendency toward disorder which both we and our brains constantly try to resist.</li><li><strong><em>s</em></strong> — sensory input: everything we receive from the external world — sounds, tactile sensations, visual images, etc.</li><li><strong><em>m</em></strong> — internal model: our internal representation of how the world works. Essentially, our expectations about external reality or specific aspects of it.</li><li><strong><em>P</em></strong><em> </em>— probability: represents the likelihood of a certain sensory input given our internal model (it’s defined by what’s in the parentheses but not part of the main operation). The result ranges from 0 to 1, since it’s a probability.</li><li><strong>−ln</strong> — natural logarithm: this function converts probabilities (values between 0 and 1) into a scale from 0 to infinity, making the difference between expectation and reality mathematically measurable but not limited.</li></ul><p>The higher the probability, the smaller the resulting value. In other words, our brain is “happy” when the probability of our expectations matching what we actually perceive equals 1 (maximum probability) — in that case, F=0. The lower the probability (P), the greater the amount of free energy (F): 1 = 0; 0.5 = 0.69; 0.1 = 2.3; 0.01 = 4.6.</p><p>Let’s look at an example. A user moves the cursor over something that looks like a button: text on a bright blue rectangle.</p><figure><img alt=""Interface example of a button with active cursor"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*idKF4TdvSkphrORSln-aGg.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p>m — the user expects that the button will somehow change its state, what we usually call a hover state.</p><p>s — nothing happens to the button itself, but the cursor changes.</p><p>Technically, the user’s expectations were violated. But since our internal models are more complex than a single visual reaction, the additional input (the cursor change) helped complete the picture. When the button eventually responds to a click, the user almost immediately forgets the odd interaction.</p><p>Their P might have dropped slightly, perhaps to 0.95, meaning the probability that their mental model still matches the incoming input remains very high. The amount of free energy is close to zero. The brain is calm, the user is satisfied, the product is sold.</p><p>Now let’s take a negative example. The user moves the cursor over the same button: the same text, the same blue rectangle. The user once again expects that clicking it will initiate a purchase, that’s our m (the internal model).</p><p>But the response is nothing: no color change, no cursor change, not even an error message. The user clicks repeatedly. Their P (probability) that their mental model matches the actual input, drops close to zero.</p><figure><img alt=""Interface example of a button with no hover feedback."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SN8vFhrI6J4EoE0zb1jFCA.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p>The brain starts trying to reduce the growing amount of free energy, sending out emotional signals. In this case, the button, the site, the entire interaction become irritants. Almost unconsciously, the user begins performing a series of random actions, trying to fix the problem.</p><p>And if we’re lucky, they eventually scroll up and notice that the email field is outlined in red with a message saying it’s required. They enter the email, click Buy again, and finally succeed.</p><p>Not as happy, but at least with a product on the way. All of this happened simply because the button had no disabled state, no visual communication that it couldn’t yet be pressed, forcing the user to waste five tense seconds clicking into nothing.</p><p>This is a fairly simple example that directly illustrates the relationship between our expectations and our perception of reality. But there are many others that you, as designers, already know well.</p><p>Take the Gestalt principles, for instance. We don’t just see a random collection of shapes but we instinctively try to group them and assign meaning. It’s something our brain does automatically, without conscious effort. That’s exactly why, at the beginning of this section, I emphasized that this principle isn’t about us as individuals. It’s about our brain itself.</p><p>Our brain constantly relies on its internal model, comparing it with the incoming sensory input we receive. And when the amount of free energy becomes too high, the brain automatically tries to fix the problem.</p><p>It starts to create new categories or groups, sending the necessary emotional signals to push us toward resolving the discrepancy. Sometimes, it adjusts the internal model itself, modifying m in the formula to reduce the gap between expectation and reality. That’s actually how we learn something new and this, in fact, can explain the very nature of our neuroplasticity.</p><p>But the brain can also go the other way distorting perception, effectively altering s in the formula, the sensory input itself. And that’s where we enter the territory of cognitive biases and perceptual illusions, an entire field in itself, and one that truly deserves the attention of us designers.</p><h3>Abduction is the key to humanity</h3><p>I’m confident in saying that almost every well-known principle we are using in design can ultimately be explained through the Free Energy Principle. But that doesn’t mean we, as designers, need to consciously apply it in our daily work. Good and even excellent designers usually operate within the beginner and intermediate levels of design psychology, and that’s more than enough to create meaningful, functional products.</p><p>For me personally, it has always been and still is fascinating to understand why things, principles, and rules work the way they do. That’s why I try to find explanations and new perspectives through different sciences. And psychology is one of them.</p><p>With this article, I’d like to invite you to look at the familiar design dogmas we follow from a slightly different angle and to try broadening our perspective.</p><p>In a world where AI already knows all these rules and can even create interfaces based on them, what may soon remain truly ours is our human curiosity, the desire to reach for truth, to question what we take for granted, and to look at problems from new angles, expanding the boundaries of any given task.</p><p>In the language of philosophy, specifically the branch of logic we, as humans and users, most often rely on deduction and induction.</p><p>Deduction is deriving consequences from established rules. When we build our hypotheses based on principles and patterns. All clickable elements should change their state on hover → This button changes its state on hover → Therefore, this button is a clickable element.</p><p>Induction is generalizing from experience. When we conduct direct user testing. Our user clicked 100 different buttons, and each time the button changed its state on hover → The user now expects that all buttons should change their state when hovered over.</p><p>But we, as designers, are expected to bring new ideas into the world.</p><p>So I’d like to invite you to look at another type of reasoning — abduction.

Then estimate which solution “minimizes free energy”, meaning yields the highest probability that perception will match expectation. And that’s your leading candidate.</p><p>And remember, psychology gives us the lens, design provides the tools, but the final verdict always belongs to the human being whose subjective perception can overturn any formula. That’s why theory is only valuable as long as it remains flexible, ready to yield to real observation, to the living unpredictable experience of the people we design for.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=0e557d122b81"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/lower-the-surprise-applying-the-free-energy-principle-to-ux-0e557d122b81"">Lower the surprise: Applying The free energy principle to UX</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I mapped where intelligence lives, traced where humans direct and where AI executes.</p><p><strong>Here’s what they actually did differently.</strong></p><p><strong>The answer isn’t in the AI models. It’s in how they architect the flow of work between human and AI.</strong></p><p>This is what I call <strong>Intelligence Flow Architecture</strong> — the design of HOW cognitive work flows between human and artificial intelligence. Not what the AI can do, but how the collaboration is structured. Where does intelligence live? Who does what work?

Visualization created with Gemini AI.</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>What I mean by “architecture”:</strong> I’m not talking about software architecture (microservices, backend systems) or information architecture (navigation, content structure). I’m talking about <strong>architecting the “how”</strong> — the flow of cognitive work between human and AI. Who does what? Where does intelligence live? How do they collaborate? This is the discipline of designing intelligent systems, not just intelligent features.</p><p>Let me show you exactly how Perplexity and NotebookLM do it — and what you can apply to your own products.</p><h3>The architecture difference</h3><p>Here’s what people miss:</p><p>Both products run on the same foundation — large language models, vector embeddings, search APIs, retrieval-augmented generation.</p><p><strong>Same ingredients. Completely different results.</strong></p><p>Why? Because they architected different <strong>intelligence flows</strong> — different answers to these critical questions:</p><ul><li>WHERE does AI work autonomously?</li><li>WHERE does human provide direction?</li><li>HOW do they hand off work between them?</li><li>WHAT intelligence lives in which layer?</li></ul><blockquote><strong><em>In his </em></strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ""><strong><em>June 2025 keynote at Y Combinator</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Andrej Karpathy — former director of AI at Tesla and OpenAI co-founder — described this exact shift:</em></strong><em> </em>“LLMs aren’t just tools anymore. They’re becoming operating systems. The LLM is the CPU, the context window is the memory, and the real design work is architecting how this new computer orchestrates problem-solving.”</blockquote><p>That’s exactly what Perplexity and NotebookLM understood.</p><p><strong>Watch what happens:</strong></p><p>When you ask <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/"">Perplexity</a> a question, AI doesn’t give you search results to click. It searches, synthesizes, answers, and cites sources — all autonomously.</p><p><strong>Flow:</strong> You direct → AI discovers → You evaluate</p><p>When you upload documents to <a href=""https://notebooklm.google.com/"">NotebookLM</a>, AI doesn’t just “chat about your docs.” It analyzes, maps relationships, and generates insights — without waiting for instructions.</p><p><strong>Flow:</strong> You curate sources → AI orchestrates knowledge → You explore</p><p>These are different architectures of collaboration.</p><p>Let me deconstruct both — layer by layer.</p><h3>Perplexity’s intelligence flow architecture: Real-time discovery</h3><p>What makes Perplexity feel different from Google isn’t better search. It’s a different distribution of cognitive work.</p><h4><strong>THE DESIGN DECISIONS:</strong></h4><p>Someone architected this. Someone decided:</p><ul><li>AI executes search autonomously (you don’t click 10 tabs)</li><li>AI synthesizes while streaming (you don’t wait for batch results)</li><li>AI handles citations in real-time (you don’t copy-paste sources)</li><li>Human directs through conversation (you don’t fill search forms)</li></ul><p><strong>Cognitive split: ~20% Human (direction + evaluation) / 80% AI (discovery + synthesis)</strong></p><p><strong>What this feels like to you as a user:</strong></p><p>You ask a question. Seconds later, you’re reading a synthesized answer with sources — without opening ten browser tabs. It feels like the system “just knows” what you meant and found the answer for you.</p><p>That feeling isn’t magic. <strong>It’s architecture.</strong></p><p>The intelligence lives in the synthesis layer, orchestrating search and combining sources in real-time.</p><figure><img alt=""Perplexity’s 5-layer architecture showing the 20% human / 80% AI cognitive split.

Document understanding.</p><h4><strong>THE DESIGN DECISIONS:</strong></h4><p>Someone architected this. Someone decided:</p><ul><li>AI works only with YOUR documents (not the entire web)</li><li>AI builds knowledge graph invisibly (you experience results, not structure)</li><li>AI generates multiple formats from same knowledge base</li><li>Human curates sources and exploration direction</li></ul><p><strong>Cognitive split: ~30% Human (curation + direction) / 70% AI (analysis + orchestration)</strong></p><p><strong>What this feels like to you as a user:</strong></p><p>You upload research papers. Within seconds, the system “understands” them — not just text search, but conceptual understanding. It finds connections you hadn’t seen. It can explain your own documents back to you in different formats.</p><p>That feeling isn’t magic. <strong>It’s architecture.</strong></p><p>The intelligence lives in the knowledge processing layer, building invisible structure that enables multiple interaction modes.</p><figure><img alt=""NotebookLM’s 5-layer architecture showing the 30% human / 70% AI cognitive split.

Note Layer 4’s gradient — it’s collaborative, where human and AI work together in the interaction loop. </em>Visualization created with Gemini AI.</figcaption></figure><h4>The pattern they both reveal</h4><p>Both succeed because they architected intelligence flows with clear principles.</p><p>(If you look back at the hero infographic at the top, you’ll see the contrast: Traditional AI = features bolted onto existing UIs. Intelligence Flow Architecture = intelligence embedded in the system’s core.)</p><h4><strong>The four principles</strong></h4><h3>Principle 1: Design backward from autonomous execution</h3><p>Don’t start with: <em>“What interface should we show?”</em></p><p>Start with: <em>“What will the system DO autonomously?”</em></p><ul><li>Perplexity: Search + synthesize + cite</li><li>NotebookLM: Analyze + map + generate formats</li></ul><p>Then design everything else to enable that autonomy.</p><p>This inverts traditional software design. Traditional products started with the interface — buttons, menus, workflows — then built backend systems to support them. Intelligence-first architecture starts with autonomous execution and works backward.</p><blockquote><em>The shift is profound: from </em>“How will users accomplish this task?” to “What can the system accomplish autonomously?” <em>As </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_RjOhCkhvQ""><em>Satya Nadella</em></a><em> noted, we’re moving business logic from the application tier to the intelligence tier. The execution layer defines your system’s value — everything else exists to enable it.</em></blockquote><p>Without this inversion, you end up with “AI features” bolted onto traditional interfaces. The intelligence feels like an add-on because it IS an add-on. True intelligence-first architecture means intelligence is embedded as fundamental structure, not added as features.</p><h3>Principle 2: Embed intelligence in specific layers</h3><p>Don’t bolt AI on as features.</p><p>Architect where intelligence lives:</p><ul><li>Perplexity: Intelligence in synthesis layer</li><li>NotebookLM: Intelligence in knowledge processing layer</li></ul><p>The intelligence isn’t visible as “AI feature” — it’s structural.</p><p>The test for embedded intelligence: Can you remove the AI and still have a functional product? If yes, intelligence is bolted on. If no, it’s embedded.</p><p>Perplexity without its synthesis intelligence doesn’t exist — it’s not “Google with AI added,” it’s a fundamentally different architecture where intelligence IS the product. NotebookLM’s knowledge processing layer isn’t a feature you can toggle off; it’s the system’s foundation.</p><p>This architectural embedding happens in specific layers of your five-layer stack. Intelligence doesn’t float everywhere — it concentrates where transformation occurs. In Perplexity, that’s Layer 2 (synthesis orchestration). In NotebookLM, it’s Layer 2 (knowledge graph construction). Identify where YOUR system’s intelligence must live, then build everything to support that layer.</p><h3>Principle 3: Design clear human/AI boundaries</h3><p>Define precisely where AI works autonomously and where human provides direction:</p><ul><li>Perplexity: Human directs → AI discovers → Human evaluates</li><li>NotebookLM: Human curates → AI orchestrates → Human explores</li></ul><blockquote><strong><em>Think of this as creating control maps — the new journey maps for AI experiences.</em></strong><em> Instead of mapping what users do, you map who is in control (user, AI, or both) and when that control shifts. As </em><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/from-journey-maps-to-control-maps-17aac58b9dd9""><em>Rob Chappell</em></a><em> notes, </em>“The question is no longer ‘What is the user trying to do?’ The more relevant question is: ‘Who is in control at this moment, and how does that shift?’”</blockquote><p>This is the evolution from traditional user journeys to human-AI collaboration flows.</p><p><strong>This pattern is becoming so clear that in June 2025, Karpathy dedicated his Y Combinator keynote to it.</strong> He calls it “partial autonomy” — systems where AI generates and humans verify in a continuous loop.</p><p>The architectural insight: <strong>The fastest generation-verification loop wins. Not the most autonomous AI.</strong></p><p>That’s why <a href=""https://cursor.com/"">Cursor</a> (coding), Perplexity (search), and NotebookLM (research) are succeeding — they optimized the loop, not the autonomy.</p><h3>Principle 4: Optimize for cognitive distribution</h3><p>Not: “Can AI do this task?”</p><p>But: “SHOULD AI do this, or SHOULD human?”</p><ul><li><strong>Human strengths:</strong> Goal definition, judgment, creative direction, evaluation</li><li><strong>AI strengths:</strong> Discovery, synthesis, pattern recognition, execution</li></ul><p>Both products make this mapping explicit in their architecture.</p><p>This requires mapping cognitive strengths systematically. From your Hybrid Cognition Map: Humans excel at goal definition, context understanding, judgment calls, ambiguity resolution, ethical decisions, creative direction, and stakeholder intuition. AI excels at information retrieval, pattern recognition, rapid iteration, consistency, tedious execution, multi-source synthesis, and 24/7 availability.</p><p>The magic happens at the intersection — not human OR AI, but human AND AI working in complementary strengths. Perplexity distributes: human defines information need (judgment), AI discovers and synthesizes (execution). NotebookLM distributes: human curates sources (context), AI processes and orchestrates (synthesis).</p><p>Poor cognitive distribution creates friction. If you ask humans to do what AI does better (tedious data processing), or ask AI to do what humans do better (strategic judgment), the collaboration fails. Design explicitly for strengths, not just capabilities.</p><figure><img alt=""The complete framework: Four principles that define how Perplexity and NotebookLM architect human-AI collaboration.

I took photos of the worksheet, showed them to an AI, and asked it to generate similar exercises. Seconds later: a new practice set, perfectly matched to her level.</p><p>She finished it. Asked for another. I already had everything loaded — another set appeared in seconds.</p><p><strong>This wasn’t impressive because the AI was smart.</strong> It was impressive because I’d designed the <strong>how</strong>: Photo → Parse → Generate → Verify → Iterate. A five-second intelligence flow that would have taken me 30 minutes manually.</p><p>That’s Intelligence Flow Architecture in daily life.</p><p>Now let’s make it actionable for your team.</p><h3>From analysis to application</h3><p>You’ve seen how Perplexity and NotebookLM architect intelligence flows.</p><p>Now let’s make this actionable for your team.</p><p>The method works for any product workflow — from email to CRM to document editing.</p><p>Here’s the four-step process:</p><h3>How to apply intelligence flow architecture to your product</h3><h4><strong>STEP 1: Map your current workflow</strong></h4><p>Pick one core workflow. List every step users do manually.</p><h4><strong>STEP 2: Identify cognitive work</strong></h4><p>For each step, ask:</p><ul><li>Is this discovery work? (AI strength)</li><li>Is this synthesis? (AI strength)</li><li>Is this judgment? (Human strength)</li><li>Is this goal-setting? (Human strength)</li></ul><h4><strong>STEP 3: Design the intelligence flow</strong></h4><p>Redistribute work:</p><ul><li>What should AI do autonomously?</li><li>Where does human direct?</li><li>What are the handoff points?</li></ul><h4><strong>STEP 4: Design backward from execution</strong></h4><ul><li>What will AI execute? (execution layer)</li><li>What intelligence enables that? (intelligence layer)</li><li>How do systems coordinate? (orchestration layer)</li><li>How does human express intention? (input layer)</li></ul><h4><strong>Example: Redesigning email with Intelligence Flow Architecture</strong></h4><p>Let’s make this concrete. Here’s how Intelligence Flow Architecture transforms a common workflow — email composition.</p><p>Traditional Gmail requires you to manually type, edit, format, and send — roughly 5 minutes of writing every word. Intelligence Flow Architecture redesigns this as a 6-layer collaboration where AI handles autonomous execution while you provide direction and judgment.</p><p>The result: 30 seconds instead of 5 minutes. Directing instead of writing.</p><figure><img alt=""Email workflow transformation: Traditional Gmail requires 5 minutes of manual writing.

The Tesla lesson</h3><p>Before we dive into what this means for product teams, let’s address the obvious question: <strong>Why design for partial autonomy instead of full autonomous agents?</strong></p><p>In his June 2025 keynote, Karpathy shared a telling story from his five years building autonomous systems at Tesla:</p><p>In 2013, he took a perfect self-driving ride in a Waymo — zero interventions, flawless. He thought: “Self-driving is imminent.”</p><p><strong>That was 12 years ago.</strong> Even now, <a href=""https://waymo.com/"">Waymo vehicles</a> that appear driverless still require significant human teleoperation and oversight.</p><blockquote><strong><em>His warning applies directly to product design:</em></strong><em> When AI generates massive outputs — 10,000 lines of code, complete research reports, fully redesigned interfaces — you haven’t saved time if verification takes hours. </em>“When I see things like ‘oh 2025 is the year of agents,’ I get very concerned. This is the <strong>decade</strong> of agents.”</blockquote><blockquote><strong>“We have to keep the AI on the leash,”</strong> <em>Karpathy emphasized. Not because AI isn’t capable, but because </em><strong><em>verification speed determines actual productivity.</em></strong></blockquote><p>This is why Intelligence Flow Architecture prioritizes the generation-verification loop over full autonomy. The goal isn’t to remove humans from the loop. <strong>The goal is to make the loop spin as fast as possible.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Karpathy’s lesson from 12 years at Tesla: Fast generation-verification loops beat pursuing full autonomy.

Loop speed determines productivity, <em>not autonomy level. </em>Visualization created with Gemini AI.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>A note for designers:</strong> You might be thinking “I’m not a system architect. Can I actually apply this?” Yes. Intelligence Flow Architecture isn’t about backend engineering — it’s about design thinking applied to human-AI collaboration. Start small: Pick one workflow. Map where human directs vs where AI executes. That’s architecting intelligence flows. You’re already doing this thinking — now you have language for it.</p><h3>What this means for product teams</h3><p>Here’s what changes when you adopt Intelligence Flow Architecture:</p><h4><strong>BEFORE (AI Features):</strong></h4><ul><li>PM says: “Let’s add AI to this workflow”</li><li>Designer asks: “What should the AI button look like?”</li><li>Engineer builds: API call to GPT → show response</li><li>Result: Feature that feels bolted on</li></ul><h4><strong>AFTER (Intelligence Flow Architecture):</strong></h4><ul><li>PM asks: “What cognitive work should AI handle autonomously?”</li><li>Designer maps: Human direction → AI execution → Human evaluation</li><li>Engineer architects: Intelligence layer + orchestration layer + execution layer</li><li>Result: System that feels intelligent</li></ul><h3><strong>The pattern</strong></h3><p>Perplexity and NotebookLM didn’t ask “How do we add AI?”</p><p>They asked: “How do we architect collaboration between human and artificial intelligence?”</p><p>That’s the difference between an AI feature and an intelligent system.</p><p>That’s Intelligence Flow Architecture.</p><p>And that framework — deciding where intelligence lives, how work distributes, when systems execute autonomously — <strong>that’s intelligence-first architecture.</strong></p><p><strong>Same AI models.</strong><br /><strong>Different architecture.</strong><br /><strong>Completely different experience.</strong></p><p>Now you know why.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ace59eeda531"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/perplexity-and-notebooklm-dont-use-better-ai-they-use-better-intelligence-flow-architecture-ace59eeda531"">Perplexity and NotebookLM don’t use better AI—they use better intelligence flow architecture</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Despite its limited design, many users felt understood and emotionally “seen,” attributing empathy and intent to the system, a phenomenon later called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect""><strong>“ELIZA effect</strong></a><strong>”. </strong>From the very start, people related to even basic conversational software as if it had a mind of its own.</p><p>Long before modern AI, product and brand design had already embraced personality as a differentiator. <a href=""https://imgs.search.brave.com/bGxPgSeNEiF9Eug7c4YNn_bgulI2vwDeCDJqyq_KKtU/rs:fit:860:0:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9kMmlq/ejZvNXhheTF4cS5j/bG91ZGZyb250Lm5l/dC9hY2NvdW50XzQ4/MS9TY3JlZW5zaG90/MjAxOC0xMS0wOGF0/MTFfMDRfMThBTV81/NDI1N2M0MTI4M2Mx/NWI0YTMxNTRiNjMz/ZDRlY2IxNV84MDAu/cG5n"">Mailchimp’s playful feedback</a> or <a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/slack-copywriting-what-they-say-to-9-6-million-pageviews-every-month-4351888f1c2c"">Slack’s quirky copywriting</a> showed how tone and character could give otherwise functional software a distinctive emotional presence.

Archetypes</h3><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype#:~:text=An%20archetype%20can%20be%20any,,%20or%20%22merge%22%20into.""><strong>Brand archetypes</strong></a> are universal character prototypes drawn from Carl Jung’s psychology. Brands adopt these familiar personas to evoke specific emotions and embody core values.</p><p>Selecting an archetype helps determine whether your AI feels like a playful entertainer (Jester), a wise advisor (Sage), an empathetic supporter (Caregiver) or any of the other twelve classic archetypes.</p><figure><img alt=""A brand-archetype wheel showing twelve archetypes (Creator, Innocent, Sage, Explorer, Outlaw, Magician, Hero, Lover, Jester, Everyman, Caregiver, Ruler). Various AI products and robots are placed around the wheel to match their archetypes: Moxie and Wysa near Caregiver, Alexa and Siri near Everyman, Miko and Lovots near Lover/Jester, Replika and Character.ai near Lover, Claude near Sage, Anki Cozmo near Explorer, Cursor near Hero, Pepper and Gemini near Creator"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YV4ajRGbz6FDVgyPmzmTPQ.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Choosing an<strong> archetype layer guides</strong> —</p><ul><li><strong>How the AI presents itself visually</strong> — avatar style, colors, motion design</li><li><strong>How the AI communicates</strong> — tone of voice, phrasing, pacing, and conversational behavior.</li></ul><p>For example</p><ul><li><strong>Claude (Sage) </strong>embodies a wise, thoughtful assistant focused on clarity and balanced reasoning. Its warm, calm visual identity and starburst icon signal structure and trust, while its communication style stays gentle, honest, and reflective.</li><li><strong>Wysa (Jester + Coach)</strong> a compassionate, judgment-free companion focused on emotional support and guided healing. Its cute penguin mascot and playful tone signal approachability and warmth, while its communication style stays empathetic, encouraging, and grounded in evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy.</li></ul><p>Archetypes resonate at a subconscious level guiding the design to maintain character consistency and thus strengthening user experience and engagement.</p><h3>3. Backstory</h3><p>In consumer-facing AI, where emotional connection is key, backstory adds coherence and emotional weight to the interaction. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet_on_the_Holodeck"">Janet Murray’s Hamlet on the Holodeck</a> shows that when virtual characters have defined roles and histories, it enriches user interaction and making the system feel more alive and intentional.</p><figure><img alt=""An image of the Miko robot on the left and a chat transcript on the right, where Miko answers questions about its name, age, abilities, and identity with playful personality. A caption explains that Miko robots have rich backstories users uncover through conversation."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MXwMEzP9HuRskUPhuce0Bw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Some successful consumer products which follow this pattern strongly are</p><ul><li><a href=""http://www.miko.ai""><strong>Miko</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The companion robot invites children to ask, <em>“Where did you come from?”, “What’s your job?”, “Are you a boy or a girl?”</em> — revealing his backstory and personality through playful dialogue.</li><li><a href=""https://www.tolans.com/""><strong>Tolan</strong></a><strong>:</strong> General-purpose assistants take on the persona of friendly aliens from planet Portolah, each arriving with distinct personalities and quirks to befriend their human companions</li><li><a href=""https://character.ai/""><strong>Character.ai</strong></a><strong>:</strong> A massive platform where users chat with millions of AI characters, each with detailed backstories, personalities and fictional histories to explore.</li></ul><h3>4. Context adaptation</h3><p>Contextual adaptation is the AI’s ability to respond appropriately to a user’s <strong>situational context or emotional state</strong> and shaping tone, language, and pacing to feel human and supportive.</p><p>This relies on techniques like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_recognition""><strong>emotional state recognition</strong></a> (detecting sentiment or tone), <a href=""https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/ai-mirroring-behaviors""><strong>conversational mirroring</strong></a> (reflecting the user’s phrasing or energy), and <strong>contextual personality shifting</strong> (adjusting tone or style based on task complexity or user mood) .</p><ul><li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa""><strong>Alexa</strong></a>, though simpler, varies its vocal delivery: sounding excited when offering good news (“It’s sunny all day!”) or disappointed when reporting a loss, reinforcing its role as a helpful household companion.</li><li><a href=""https://answeringagent.com/blog/5-ways-ai-adapts-tone-for-customer-calls""><strong>T-Mobile’s AI</strong> reduced customer complaints by 73%</a> through instant detection of negative sentiment and tone mirroring</li><li><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.replika.app&amp;hl=en_IN&amp;pli=1""><strong>Replika</strong></a>, performs deep, long-term mirroring. It learns a user’s vocabulary, emotional patterns, and interaction style over many conversations, gradually shaping its own language, tone, and even “personality” to reflect the individual.</li></ul><h3>5. Visual identity</h3><p>Visual identity is often the first layer through which users infer an AI product’s personality. Design decisions around logo, avatar, color, type and even hardware shapes cues.</p><figure><img alt=""Image showing Perplexity’s geometric logo, Claude’s serif typography, and the Lovot robot. A caption notes that Claude’s serifs feel warm and credible, Perplexity’s sans-serif feels modern and analytical, and Lovot’s soft design conveys a companion-like personality."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sQ7i9Nt3p9T041kdfEAYoQ.jpeg"" /></figure><ul><li><strong>Logo/ Avatar/ Embodied identity </strong>give an AI a recognizable “face” and act as an immediate proxy for personality. For instance, <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/"">Perplexity</a>’s logo, is minimal, geometric, and abstract and it subtly animates during search to cue users that AI is creating an answer. On the other end of the spectrum, more expressive AI products like <a href=""https://lovot.life/en/"">Lovot</a> uses a physical body, large eyes, soft materials, and even personalised clothing to project warmth, affection, and a companion-like presence.</li><li><strong>Typography</strong> contributes to brand voice in chat interfaces. For example, <strong>Claude’s serif typography conveys</strong> warmth, maturity, and approachability — qualities that align with its thoughtful, privacy-first positioning. <strong>Perplexity’s geometric sans-serif communicates</strong> modern technical clarity and reliability, reinforcing its role as a precise, research-oriented tool.</li><li><strong>Illustrations/ Imagery:</strong> Supports communicating information in a delightful way</li><li><strong>Motion and Animation: </strong>Motion guidelines define how elements animate, transition, and respond to user interaction.</li><li><strong>Color palette</strong> reinforce AI personality archetypes by leveraging emotional associations rooted in color psychology. For example. blue signals trust and calm (Alexa), bright green colours signal playfulness and growth (Duolingo, Miko) and muted tones as professionalism (Notion AI).</li></ul><h3>6. Communication style &amp; copy</h3><p>Communication style and copy are also the most visible expressions of an AI’s personality. Whether experienced through <strong>voice or text,</strong> elements like <strong>tone</strong>, <strong>phrasing</strong>, <strong>pacing</strong>, <strong>formality </strong>work together to communicate character’s personality and guide user experience.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Duolingo’s writing guidelines page showing the section on ‘Voice’. It describes how Duolingo’s brand personality appears through words, supported by four voice qualities — expressive, playful, embracing and worldly — with a sidebar menu on the left and an illustration on top"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZOGg6drhwqpcvegAtbKosw.jpeg"" /></figure><h4>Core elements shared across voice and chat interfaces</h4><ul><li><strong>Tone</strong> sets the emotional posture: formal tones (e.g., <em>Sage</em>, <em>Ruler</em>) project authority and professionalism, while informal tones (e.g., <em>Everyman</em>, <em>Jester</em>) build warmth and approachability. For example, <a href=""https://www.capitalone.com/digital/tools/eno/"">Capital One’s Eno</a> uses “First things first” is perceived as friendlier than “Here is the first step” in user research.</li><li><strong>Phrasing and vocabulary</strong> reflect personality cues. For instance, a Caregiver might say “<em>“Let me walk you through this , we’ll figure it out together,”</em>,” while Sage personas might use precise, technical terms (e.g., “<em>“Let me explain the details step by step</em>”).</li><li><strong>Pacing and prosody</strong> (in voice), or <strong>structure and grammar</strong> (in text), shape rhythm and emphasis which is key to emotional delivery and comprehension. Models from <a href=""https://elevenlabs.io/docs/models"">ElevanLabs V3</a> and <a href=""https://cartesia.ai/sonic"">Cartesia</a> uses intentional pauses and inflection to simulate human-like and expressive speech generation.</li></ul><h4>Modality differences: Voice vs. Chat</h4><p>Voice-first interfaces (e.g., Alexa, Miko) rely heavily on <strong>prosody, timing, and conversational repair</strong>. Spoken interactions are adaptive — users naturally adjust tone, pacing, or emphasis when there’s confusion.</p><p>In contrast, chat-based interfaces (e.g., Claude, Perplexity) emphasize <strong>structural clarity, grammar, and concise phrasing</strong>. Because written responses can’t be corrected mid-delivery, users expect a higher degree of accuracy and polish.</p><h3>7. Multimodal feedback</h3><p><strong>Multimodal feedback</strong> refers to the way an AI system expresses its internal states such as listening, thinking, processing, or responding sometime called <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/chain-of-thoughts""><strong>Chain-of-thought (CoT)</strong></a><strong> display </strong>through various visual design elements and multiple sensory channels. These channels can include <strong>visual cues</strong>, <strong>voice and sound design</strong>, <strong>micro-animations</strong>, <strong>LED lights</strong>, or <strong>haptics</strong>.</p><p><strong>It allows users to <em>see</em>, <em>hear</em> or <em>feel</em> what the AI is doing</strong>, making the interaction more interpretable, human-like and trustworthy.</p><figure><img alt=""Four examples of AI systems showing how they express internal state: Replit panels with micro-animations for thinking steps; Alexa device with LED ring phases — idle, listening, thinking, speaking; Duolingo voice call using animated character face; Moxie robot using voice, eyes, and body movement"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2C-JnFqBHXrmlqKoxgfg-g.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Multimodal feedback varies across products depending on how much personality is intended for the product.</p><ul><li><a href=""https://replit.com/ai"">Replit AI</a>, <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/"">Perplexity</a>, <a href=""https://claude.ai/"">Claude</a><strong> </strong>relies on <strong>icon animations</strong> and <strong>microcopy</strong> to communicates system states.</li><li>Alexa devices like <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B8V1LZ3?ref=amzdv_ucc_dp_lod__B09B8V1LZ3&amp;th=1"">Echo dot</a> uses <strong>LED lights</strong>, <strong>voice tone</strong> and <strong>sound effects</strong> to express internal states. The glowing ring is soft and household-friendly, reinforcing her calm, helpful persona.</li><li><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/moxierobot/"">Moxie</a> robot<strong> </strong>combines <strong>voice and non verbal cues </strong>— screen animations, sound effects and hand and body movements<strong> </strong>to communicate states in a child-friendly, playful way consistent with its worldview of empathy and curiosity.</li></ul><h4><strong>Interaction rhythm and timing</strong></h4><p>Interaction rhythm and timing are critical to how AI systems communicate through multimodal cues. Research in human–robot interaction (Michalowski et al., 2007; Hoffman &amp; Breazeal, 2007; Breazeal, 2003) shows when robots align their timing with humans — pausing at the right moments, matching conversational pacing, or synchronizing gesture and gaze —<strong> interactions feel more alive</strong>, more engaging<strong>, more lifelike, and more trustworthy</strong>.</p><p>Products like <strong>Tolans</strong> use coordinated animations, eye-gaze, and motion timing to signal attention and emotional states, making the characters feel alive. Voice agents like <strong>Alexa</strong> similarly use rhythmic cues — brief pauses, LED pulses, and vocal pacing — to create a sense of responsiveness. In both cases, achieving the right timing transforms abstract AI behaviour into something that feels intentional, expressive, and socially fluent.</p><h3>When does personality matter?</h3><p>The fundamental question to ask before designing for personality, if your product needs one and how complex?</p><p>Not every AI system needs a quirky mascot or empathetic voice. The role of personality depends on what problem the product is solving and what users expect from AI<em>.</em></p><figure><img alt=""This chart provides a relative comparison of each product based on how many personality patterns it uses and the depth of their implementation. A more detailed scoring breakdown will be released in a separate article"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MVIKD6P88sCcG2q5gd0IIQ.jpeg"" /></figure><p><strong>In enterprise, B2B SaaS, </strong>or high-utility applications<strong>, personality is kept limited </strong>like professional tone, clear explanations and minimal flair as seen in tools like Ema, Salesforce Einstein or Intercom where u<a href=""http://www.ijdesign.org/index.php/IJDesign/article/view/861/366"">sers value accuracy, compliance, and integration</a>.</p><p><strong>In</strong> <strong>consumer AI</strong>,<strong> personality is often the differentiator</strong> driving engagement, trust, and habit-building where functionality is commoditized. Duolingo’s cheeky Duo, Miko’s playful child companion, Alexa’s polite household voice, Claude’s thoughtful collaborator persona, and Lovable’s friendly co-creative tone all show how personality, delights, stickiness, and emotional connection become as important as utility itself.</p><h3>References</h3><ul><li><a href=""https://www.anthropic.com/research/collective-constitutional-ai-aligning-a-language-model-with-public-input""><strong>Collective Constitutional AI</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Aligning a Language Model with Public Input by Anthropic</li><li><a href=""https://www.anthropic.com/news/introducing-claude""><strong>Introducing Claude</strong></a> (March 2023) by Anthropic</li><li><a href=""https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262533485/hamlet-on-the-holodeck/""><strong>Hamlet on the Holodeck</strong></a>: The future of narrative in cyberspace.

When I told one of my best friends I was finally about to get a Korean digital perm, she was horrified and said I would probably regret it. Look, I get it. The perm is controversial. You probably instantly think of giant fluffy ’80s hairdos or tight ringlets. But unlike traditional perms, the Korean style uses heat technology to create softer curls, which appear more natural. </p>



<p>My hair is naturally straight with a slight wave that becomes more obvious the shorter it is. I also have incredibly thick and heavy lengths, so when I use a curling iron, I have to douse my hair in hairspray to ensure the curls don’t fall out. As somebody who’s always wanted curly hair, getting a Korean digital perm was an easy decision. Both my older brother and sister have perms, so I was confident going in. I went to my hairstylist Chloe Choi at <a href=""https://www.chloehair.com.au/"">Chloe Hair &amp; Beauty</a>, but Korean perms are becoming more popular in salons worldwide. Together, we discussed what could be done while looking at some photos I’d brought along for inspiration. She confirmed that my hair type is frizzy with a slight natural wave, and we settled on a direct digital perm to create some tighter curls. </p>

<p>There are a handful of benefits to a Korean perm: “Normal perms mean sometimes you can’t see definition in the curls, but with digital perms you can,” said Choi, who used to work at a salon in Myeong-dong, South Korea, before moving to Sydney. Before we started with my perm, Choi recommended starting with a Japanese Tokio Treatment, which helps repair hair from the inside out. By replenishing it with keratin, it strengthens, moisturizes, and smooths each hair strand. “A lot of people really like this brand,” Choi explained. “It’s a repairing treatment, and it adds moisture to your hair. Some people will come back after their perms get dry and then have another Tokio Treatment,” she told me.</p>



<h2>What is a Korean digital perm?</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11947860.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>

<p>Choi started by washing my hair and applying the Tokio Treatment, before setting up an additional hot steam treatment to help hydrate each strand of hair. The steam “opens” up the hair cuticle, allowing moisture and products to absorb. After getting a small trim where Choi enhanced my layers, my hair was rewashed with a pH-balancing shampoo. She then followed this with a Korean product that protects the hair from the typically harsh perming chemicals used to break and reset the protein bonds in the hair. It’s this which results in a curl or wave. </p>



<p>Next, Choi placed the digital perm lotion directly onto my hair and rolled sections tightly into curlers to take shape, then plugged each curler in, allowing them to be set by heat. Choi told me that my hair was “strong”, so we had to wait over 20 minutes before it started to set. Then we headed back to the basin where my hair was washed with a neutralizer, snapping the protein bonds back into place. Et voilà! I was now a member of the curly hair club.</p>



<h2>How do you style a Korean digital perm?</h2>



<p>To style my hair, Choi gave me a slight side part, which created a more voluminous look from the scalp. She added some curl cream to define the waves and recommended investing in some good products. Her top tip? “If you have frizzy hair and you want to style it while it’s dry, mix curl cream with a little bit of water in your palms before using it on your hair,” she said. “This helps get rid of the frizz and also hydrates it.”</p>



<p>Styling a digital perm at home isn’t too difficult, either. I have a sensitive scalp, so I’ve purchased some sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. Sulfate-free products will also prolong the perm’s results. I wash my hair with lukewarm water in the shower before scrunching up the curls with a microfiber towel. Next, I add curl cream to define my curls and continue to scrunch them upwards, before using my <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.laifentech.com%2Fproducts%2Flaifen-se-2-high-speed-hair-dryer"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Laifen Hair Dryer</a> (a Dyson dupe) with a diffuser to blow-dry the perm in place. </p>

<h2>How long do you have to wait after a Korean perm to wash your hair?</h2>



<p>Your stylist will let you know how long you should go without washing your perm à la <em>Legally Blonde</em>. For me, I had to wait a minimum of 48 hours before washing my hair after getting my digital perm.</p>



<h2>Can a Korean digital perm cause damage to your hair?</h2>



<p>A digital perm uses chemicals that alter your hair structure and heat to set it in place, so most hairstylists recommend doing it on virgin hair. They also recommend steering clear of perms if your hair is bleached, chemically straightened, or very fine. Bleach in particular weakens the hair by breaking its bonds, which means perm solutions don’t interact well with it. Ultimately, the hair often lacks the strength to hold a set shape, making the process more likely to fail.</p>



<h2>How do you take care of your Korean perm?</h2>



<p>Getting a perm might increase frizz if your hair is prone to it. This is because when the chemical process weakens the hair, it also lifts the cuticle. I’d recommend investing in a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fslip-pure-silk-pillowcase%2F4186794%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopqmzmVbIIqoypAqEzT6eEntgnIoFgt2xwHEu4gn-JL76f3n-bF"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">silk pillowcase</a> or a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fwomens-mulberry-silk-bonnet-with-long-ribbons%2F8701502%3F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">silk bonnet</a> to help keep the frizz to a minimum. Also try a moisturizing leave-in hair product like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fk18-hair-molecular-repair-hair-oil-P505266"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">K18 Biomimetic Hairscience Molecular Repair Hair Oil</a>, which contains peptides, avocado oil, and squalane to help smooth and repair the broken bonds that lead to frizz. </p>



<h2>How do you ask for a Korean digital perm?</h2>



<p>Doing your research and choosing a properly qualified expert is key. I would also recommend bringing reference photos so your stylist can see which kind of curl you are after. It’s also important to discuss your hair health and type, and whether a perm will cause extra frizz or breakage for you. </p>



<p>I can safely say that having a digital perm has led to more conversations about my hair than I’ve had in years — and it looks <em>much</em> healthier than my pastel pink or purple-silver combo. I’m able to wake up with voluminous hair ready to go, and if I need to style it a little bit, I can just use some curl cream, which also helps hydrate my hair. It’s less maintenance than colored hair, so I’m convinced I’m a perm girl for life. </p>

<p>Gold hoop earrings are the ultimate <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jewelry-trends-2025"">jewelry MVP</a>. Season-less, versatile, and always pulling their weight, they work just as well with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/abercrombie-fitch-fall-sale"">jeans</a> as they do with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fall-wedding-guest-dresses"">wedding guest dresses</a> (and they especially make for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-art-of-giving"">thoughtful holiday gifts</a>). Whether you’re into dainty huggies or chunky tubes and other <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/heart-shaped-earrings"">statement styles</a>, there’s a gold hoop for every mood.<br /><br />Some outfits call for the barely-there charm of petite hoops that hug the lobe, while others practically demand extra-large, look-at-me designs. Of course, nothing beats the classics: 14-karat yellow gold and white gold hoops — especially when they’re <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-tarnish-free-gold-jewelry"">tarnish-free</a> — because they’re as reliable as your favorite white T-shirt. <br /><br />Ahead, we’ve rounded up the best gold hoops in every trending category. Maybe you’re hunting for a pair to wear 24/7 or chasing a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-luxury-gifts-under-50"">luxe gift</a> for yourself or a loved one this holiday season. Either way, these picks are guaranteed to add a finishing touch to both your jewelry box and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-fashion-beauty-trends-forecast-2025-2026"">winter outfits</a>.</p>

<h2>14K Gold Hoop Earrings</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940584.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The perfect blend of luxury and wearability, true 14k gold hoops are an investment that deliver timeless sophistication. Whether you choose Mejuri’s sleek pair, Kinn’s lightweight everyday option, or Angara’s unique square hoop shape, these are your forever earrings — versatile for coffee runs <em>and</em> soirées alike.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Huggies &amp; Small Gold Hoop Earrings</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940585.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Small gold hoops may be subtle, but these pint-sized pieces bring just the right touch of shine to any look. Huggies also, well, hug your lobes just right, offering maximum comfort while still adding a polished touch to your outfit. Given their <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-petite-workwear-ann-taylor"">petite size</a>, you can easily stack them to climb your ear or wear them solo. From twisted tubes to diamond accents, there’s a huggie for every sartorial vibe.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>White Gold Hoop Earrings</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940586.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>If all the viral <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/teddy-blonde-hair-color-trend"">color analysis videos</a> have convinced you that you’re more of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/silver-nails-manicure-trend-ideas"">silver gal</a> (but you still want the luxe durability that gold provides), white gold is the cool-toned twist you need to own. Best of all, brands have designed just as many options in white gold as they have in the metal’s yellow-gold counterpart, including classic small and large hoops, as well as textured and bubbled designs.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Chunky Gold Hoop Earrings</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940587.png?width=960&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=15%3A16"" /></figure>



<p>Thick gold hoops balance boldness with timeless appeal. Some retain a sleek and sculptural feel, while others lean into a chunky and puffy silhouette. Either way, they effortlessly elevate everything from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/copenhagen-fashion-week-fall-winter-2025-street-style"">minimalist outfits</a> to<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cardigan-sweaters""> cozy cardigans</a>. And sure, bigger can certainly be better, but that doesn’t always mean more expensive — these styles all come in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/free-people-under-100-gifts"">under $150</a>.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Large Gold Hoop Earrings </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940588.png?width=818&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=409%3A512"" /></figure>



<p>Make a statement with a pair of go-to large gold hoops. How big you go in circumference is up to you, of course. An oversized pair made from a single thin wire is a classic, while others feature sculptural details begging for a double-take. Continuous circles and open-ended backs both bring just the right amount of drama to everything from a black turtleneck to a tailored blazer — and require little other jewelry. </p>

<p><strong><em>Minor spoilers for </em></strong><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/12/11239502/emily-in-paris-season-3-fashion-outfits""><strong><em>Emily in Paris</em></strong></a><strong><em> Season 5 ahead. </em></strong><a href=""http://www.netflix.com/emilyinparis""><em>Emily In Paris</em></a> is back for another season of champagne-fueled chaos, couture-level escapism, and questionable romantic decisions, all wrapped in a brightly-filtered fantasy where the stakes are low, the outfits are loud, and the drama is deliciously unserious. If you’ve been watching the show for four seasons, you know that it’s usually Emily (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/02/11280477/lily-collins-bangs-beauty-routine"">Lily Collins</a>) in the midst of an ill-advised cobblestone alleyway makeout and while her bestie Mindy (<a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7166706221678857514"">Ashley Park</a>) is no stranger to a love triangle, she’s usually the one dishing out advice for Emily on her messy entanglements instead of finding herself wrapped up in them herself. Not this season. </p>



<p>Enter the scandal no one saw coming but everyone will have an opinion on: <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/mindy-alfie-emily-in-paris-season-5-relationship-rcna248864"">Alfie and Mindy</a>. Yes, <em>that</em> Alfie (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/its_lucien/?hl=en"">Lucien Laviscount</a>) — Emily’s charming, handsome, British, jilted, (did I mention handsome?) ex — and Mindy, the glitter-soaked pop princess whose devotion to Emily is as strong as her impressive vocals. At the end of last season, Mindy was single, fresh off a breakup with Nico (Park’s <a href=""https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a46541315/ashley-park-paul-forman-relationship-timeline/"">real-life ex, Paul Forman</a>), and moving on from Benoît (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/kev.dias/?hl=en"">Kevin Dias</a>) and her band after they got <a href=""https://screenrant.com/emily-in-paris-season-4-part-2-ending-explained/"">disqualified from Eurovision</a>. This season, she flees to Rome to join Emily and outrun her problems, and runs straight into Alfie. Of course, drama is destined to ensue after you sleep with your best friend’s ex, and it would be easy to write this off as a Season 5 gimmick the writers threw in because they were searching for storylines, but the Alfie and Mindy hookup feels fresh. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>When we first heard about this might be a plot line, I really thought it was a joke, and I called [Lily], and I was like, ‘Wait, what’s going on’? </p><cite>ashley park on alfie and mindy</cite></blockquote></figure>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951273.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /><figcaption>Emily In Paris. Ashley Park as Mindy in Emily In Paris. Cr. Giulia Parmigiani/Netflix © 2025</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>First of all, the chemistry between Park and Laviscount is surprisingly steamy considering they’ve interacted onscreen for seasons without even a hint of a spark. But this season, it’s electric. What begins as a “when in Rome” moment (sparked by boredom, champagne, and more champagne) detonates into the most deliciously messy hookup the series has ever served, threatening the fragile ecosystem of Emily’s inner circle. Like moving the series to Rome (temporarily), the new relationship has injected a much-needed jolt into a series that had been floundering under pretty clothes, quips about Parisian cliches, and not much else. This unsuspecting situationship is exactly what the show needed. </p>



<p>I tell Park and Collins how much I’m feeling <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSYHuAcio0Z/"">Alfie and Mindy together</a> over Zoom during the show’s press junket. The real-life best friends are in Paris, naturally. “I’ve been so nervous how people are going to [react]!” Park says, relieved. Collins chimes in: “That’s great. We love that!”</p>



<p>When I ask for more of their thoughts on Alfie and Mindy and the ethics of hooking up with your best friend’s ex, Park has<em> a lot </em>to say. “The main thing in terms of girl code and your best friend’s ex [is] first of all, Emily broke up with Alfie, there were a couple relationships [in between], there’s time that’s passed,” Park says. “I think that the hurt that is caused is because [Emily and Mindy] have always been each other’s safe place, and they’ve always been nothing but honest with each other. And for Mindy to be leading her life out of fear and assuming and projecting that Emily’s gonna feel a certain way towards it, and not giving her the opportunity to be happy for her, that’s not friendship. It’s the first time we see that tested.”  </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951286.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>Emily in Paris. Lucien Laviscount as Alfie in Emily in Paris. Cr. Caroline Dubois/Netflix © 2025</figcaption></figure>



<p>As a viewer, the Alfie-Mindy situation feels both deeply wrong and impossibly right, raising thorny questions about loyalty, desire, and whether a friendship can withstand this kind of betrayal. But Park sees it differently: “It’s not necessarily about,<em> oh, you slept with my ex</em>, it’s <em>how could you not trust that I would be so happy for you?</em> When we first heard about this might be a plot line, I really thought it was a joke, and I called [Lily], and I was like, ‘Wait, what’s going on’? But it’s because I didn’t see how the story was going to blossom and flourish and in the end really deepen their sisterhood. And I think that’s something we really enjoyed doing.”</p>

<p>Collins agrees, but when it comes to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/12/11237400/emily-in-paris-season-3-quarter-life-crisis"">Emily’s love life</a>, her advice for her character is to stay away from the drama. “It’s okay to not have somebody that you’re interested in. Like, you don’t have to have somebody to be somebody,” Collins says. It’s a lesson that Emily is learning in real time this season as she starts a new romance with Marcello (Eugenio Franceschini) in Rome. But will Emily dive back into a serious relationship so soon after ending things with<a href=""https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/lucas-bravos-emily-in-paris-season-5-absence-explained-after-gabriel-shade/""> Gabriel (Lucas Bravo)</a>? Collins teases that with a new gig and new city comes a new outlook for Emily: “This year, we get to see her just being okay and saying this isn’t for me, and not being afraid of what the other person is going to say,” she says. “It’s the first time she’s been really honest with the person she’s talking to in her romantic life. I love that because I think there’s societal pressure for people who are single to want to be in a relationship. But there’s such a beautiful thing about Emily being single and being like, <em>here’s my focus, and here I am.</em> I think that’s really cool.” </p>

(L to R) Lily Collins as Emily, Eugenio Franceschini as Marcello in Emily in Paris. Cr. Caroline Dubois/Netflix © 2025</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s also cool that <a href=""https://www.thezoereport.com/culture/lily-collins-sharp-bob"">Emily (via Collins)</a> has a new, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bob-haircut-trends-2026"">sharp bob</a> this season. Usually, when a female character comes back from a hiatus with shorter hair, it’s because she’s shedding layers after a breakup (<a href=""https://time.com/6318711/felicity-haircut-25-years-premiere/"">Felicity from <em>Felicity</em></a>) or as a cruel punishment (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/05/154084/aria-a-team-pretty-little-liars-theory"">Aria in <em>Pretty Little Liars</em></a>), mostly because of a man. Emily’s bob is barely even explained this season, and Collins loves that decision. “She didn’t even need to explain it,” she says. “It was just like a life choice. She’s like, <em>Okay, I’m gonna change my hair. So what?</em>” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>She didn’t even need to explain [the bob]. It was just like a life choice. She’s like, <em>Okay, I’m gonna change my hair. So what?</em>” </p><cite>lily collins on emily’s new bob haircut</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>You’ll have to turn into <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/emily-in-paris-season-5-ending-explained-recap""><em>Emily In Paris </em>Season 5</a> to see if Emily is just as chill about Alfie and Mindy. This season dares us to decide if their hookup is a betrayal or the most honest thing either of them have done all series. I’m going with the latter. Both Alfie and Mindy have been done dirty in the romance department over the seasons and it’s time they get their happily ever after. I just hope it’s together. I also love seeing an interracial couple on mainstream TV that doesn’t involve a white person because that representation is still so rare. Let’s just forget that Alfie and Mindy’s pairing comes with a side of betrayal. Hey, we watch <em>Emily in Paris </em>for the escape, the eye-candy, the kissing, and the outfits. It’s a fantasy that thrives on us turning off our brains for a bit and sinking into the comforting belief that even the most unlikely connections can feel inevitable… especially in Paris! Or Rome? Or whatever European adventure the show wants to take us on next.</p>

<p><em>Content warning: This article discusses violence in a way that may be distressing to some readers</em>.<em> It was original published on Refinery29’s Australia edition.</em></p>



<p>On the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/hanukkah-in-australia"">first night of Hanukkah</a>, beneath the quintessential glow of a Sydney summer evening, globally beloved and iconic <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/International/alleged-bondi-beach-gunman-charged-15-counts-murder/story?id=128475208"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bondi Beach</a> turned from a scene of joy to one of terror. Families and friends had gathered for a festive beachfront celebration, lighting the menorah and singing songs, when gunfire shattered the laughter. Two gunmen, a <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/live/ckgk391yzm7t"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">father and son</a> armed with rifles, opened fire on the crowd, killing at least 15 people (including a child) and injuring dozens more. One attacker was shot dead by police, and the other was wounded and arrested amid the chaos. Australian authorities swiftly declared it a terrorist attack motivated by antisemitic hatred, an assault on the Jewish community that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said “struck at the heart of the nation”. What should have been a night of light and hope became Australia’s worst mass shooting in nearly 30 years.</p>



<p>The next morning, Bondi’s sands lay empty and silent, an unheard-of phenomenon for one of the most popular shorelines in the country, save for investigators pacing the cordoned-off area. Since then, the stories and the heroism of bystanders who tried to stop the shooters have dominated headlines. Yet the impact of this attack cannot be measured only in lives lost or injuries. Its shockwaves have rippled far beyond those who stood on the sand that night; the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/how-to-help-bondi-beach-terror-attack"">tragedy</a> has seared itself into the psyche of people around the world, including many who were nowhere near Bondi Beach when it happened.</p>



<h2>Beyond The Shore</h2>



<p>Not even in the hours after the attack, but during, phones pinged with news alerts across Australia and overseas. Many who read the headlines or watched grainy and graphic videos felt a chill of grief and fear. It didn’t matter that they were seeing it through a screen; their hearts broke, and their fear was felt in real time. In Sydney, thousands gathered at vigils the next day, mourners at Bondi laid flowers and sang prayers under the open sky. Similar tributes appeared in other cities, in Melbourne, in London outside the Australian High Commission, and beyond — a sign that the world was mourning with Bondi. </p>



<p>“Collective trauma can impact how we view the world and how we see ourselves in it — the social norms and security we were used to are challenged, making us feel unsafe and unsure, and grieving the world we understood,” explains Mental Health Therapist <a href=""https://www.baretherapy.com.au/meet-tammi"">Tammi Miller</a>.<br /></p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>These are valid feelings — the goalposts of our beliefs have been moved, and we’re trying to redefine what they are. With a big event like the Bondi attack, we’re also being fed new information over hours and days, meaning those goalposts continue to shift. It’s a lot of work mentally, and we can feel exhausted, overwhelmed and anxious.</p><cite>tammi miller, Mental Health Therapist</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>According to Principal Psychologist at Umeed Psychology, <a href=""http://www.umeed.psychology.com.au"">Anushka Phal</a>, this reaction is a form of collective trauma or vicarious trauma. “Humans don’t exist in isolation; we’re part of communities,” Phal describes this as identity-based trauma: “For people with histories of trauma, chronic stress, racism, gender-based violence, or migration stress, the nervous system is already primed to ask: Am I safe? Am I next? The body doesn’t treat it as ‘news’ — it treats it as confirmation.” She adds: “Even secondhand exposure can activate the threat system — particularly in a 24/7 media environment. The nervous system doesn’t respond to logic; it responds to danger cues, which can show up as hypervigilance, irritability, flatness, grief, and even physical symptoms.”</p>



<p>Decades of research on vicarious traumatization show that people can develop stress symptoms from simply hearing about or seeing footage of violent events. Our brains, in a sense, replay the horror as if we were there. <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/lifting-the-veil-trauma/202001/watching-the-news-can-be-traumatizing"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">One study</a> even found that individuals with no prior trauma who watched distressing news reports showed symptoms of secondary traumatic stress, such as anxiety, nightmares, and feelings of helplessness. In the case of the Bondi attack, it brutally resonated far and wide – from the Jewish community in Sydney to anyone who has ever set foot on Bondi.</p>



<p>As <a href=""http://www.mymirror.com.au"">Rachel Tomlinson</a>, a Sydney-based therapist (and one of many professionals volunteering at community support sessions this week), points out: “Trauma is processed through the nervous system first, not the thinking brain. That’s why people feel sick, shaky, or disconnected — the body is responding to a perceived threat even before we can name the emotion.”</p>



<p>She continues, “Even indirect exposure — like media — can activate this system. Freeze or dissociation responses are just as real as panic. You might feel emotionally flat, stuck, or spaced out. It’s a survival response, not weakness.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11950751.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=682&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A341"" /><figcaption>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA – DECEMBER 15: Candles are lit at the Bondi Pavilion as people pay tribute to the victims of a mass shooting at Bondi Beach yesterday, on December 15, 2025.

<h2>Coping With The Invisible Wounds</h2>



<p><strong>1. Mental health experts emphasize that your feelings are valid.</strong> Even if you were not physically present. There’s no need to say, “I wasn’t there, so I shouldn’t be this upset.” Grief, anger, fear, outrage, and numbness, all of these are natural responses. “Give yourself permission to feel whatever comes,” advises Anushka Phal. “Don’t bottle it up just because you weren’t at the scene. You’re human, and at our core, humans care about each other.” Acknowledging the pain is a first step to healing. That might mean talking to friends or family about how the news affected you, or writing down your thoughts in a journal. Some find comfort in attending vigils or religious services to honor the victims, as coming together in solidarity can ease the sense of powerlessness. Others might light a candle at home or say a prayer as a personal act of remembrance. </p>



<p><strong>2. Limiting media exposure</strong> is another important coping strategy. While it’s natural to seek information after a traumatic event, endlessly scrolling through graphic images or videos can retraumatize you. “Being unable to control when or what imagery you see following an event like the Bondi attack can make it difficult to self-regulate,” says Miller. “Repeated exposure can trigger a stress response — difficulty sleeping, irritability, trouble concentrating. It’s important to remember that you are safe in these moments, to look around you and name three things you can see, touch, feel, practise deep breathing and centering, and definitely to seek support from a confidant or trained mental health professional.”</p>



<p><strong>3. Connecting with others is crucial in these times.</strong> The Bondi Beach community has exemplified this – within 24 hours, thousands of people gathered to comfort one another, sing together, and remind themselves that they are not alone. Whether you attend a local vigil or simply call a friend to talk, sharing your feelings can lighten the emotional load. Sometimes just hearing someone say “I feel it too” can be profoundly validating. If your distress persists or feels overwhelming, consider reaching out to a mental health professional. Therapists are aware that indirect trauma is real and can help you work through it. There is no shame in seeking help; it doesn’t matter that “it didn’t happen to me,” what matters is that it affected you, and getting support is a sign of strength, not weakness.</p>



<p><strong>4. Finally, it can be healing to channel your emotions into positive action. </strong>Donate to a victims fund. Support crisis lines like Lifeline, which are seeing a huge surge in calls and will continue to through the holidays. Volunteer your time if you have capacity — or if you don’t, drop off a meal, check in on a friend, walk someone home. Acts of care don’t need to be big to matter. They just need to happen.</p>



<h2>Finding Light After The Darkness</h2>



<p>In the days since the attack, the golden sands of Bondi have been blanketed with flowers, candles, and handwritten messages. Strangers hug each other on the promenade, united in grief. The air carries the mingled scents of saltwater and candle wax as the sun sets each evening over a beach that is healing from trauma seen and unseen. The emotional wounds from that night will take time to mend, and some scars may never fully fade. But amid the sorrow, there is a steadfast resolve that the forces of hatred will not break the spirit of the community. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>You don’t have to be at the centre of an event to be affected by it. Being human, compassionate and empathic means being impacted by violence and loss, especially when it hits close to home or touches your identity. Minimizing your pain only prolongs it. </p><cite>RACHEL TOMLINSON, REGISTERED PSYCHOLOGIST</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>For anyone struggling with heavy emotions after this tragedy, know that you are entitled to those feelings, they speak to your empathy, and that with time and support, the fear and anguish can evolve into strength and meaning. </p>
