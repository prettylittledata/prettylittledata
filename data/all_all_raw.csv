Located on Józef Piłsudski Avenue, the new library is conceived as a connector between the Marshal's Office of the Podkarpackie Voivodeship and the nearby Secondary School Complex, reinforcing the area's civic character. The program combines traditional library functions with cultural, educational, and artistic spaces. In addition to reading and collection areas, an expanded event zone includes a music hall, multifunctional hall, conference rooms, and administrative areas.

<h4>Designers should be thriving in the age of AI.

Some think the role will disappear completely. Others say only super-seniors will survive. And yet others say it’s all just a blip in time and there will be no fundamental change.</p><p>I think all are wrong.</p><p>For two reasons:</p><ol><li>Designers are naturally attuned to adapt to technological change. We are trained to identify and acknowledge change, manage adaptation, and find solutions for friction.</li><li>We’re moving towards a totally new definition of digital products. Away from interfaces, and towards fluid use cases that we’re only beginning to imagine now. To make this accessible and valuable to all, we will need designers at all levels. <em>Obviously</em>.</li></ol><p>Why, then, has the design community been in absolute panic since AI has been taking off?</p><p>Seniors are telling juniors to count themselves lucky if they’ll ever find a job.</p><p>Design leaders are jumping from one AI-tool hypetrain to the next in mere weeks.</p><p>Monday, it’s all about prototypes. Thursday, it’s vibe coding. Friday, we’re preaching that output no longer matters (everyone can design now!) and that we should be brilliant strategists instead. By next Monday, we’ll be half-heartedly debating which soft skills are absolutely vital to survive.</p><p><em>Survive.</em> As designers.</p><p>As if our skills have evaporated overnight, and we can only stick around if we somehow show that we’re good for (undefined) other stuff.</p><p>No.</p><p>We should be thriving.</p><p>Where has it all gone wrong? Why aren’t designers winning in the age of AI, which, at its core, is about <em>making</em>?</p><p>The thing we do best.</p><p>Here’s what I think.</p><h4>We’ve been sabotaging ourselves.</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7ogC1IGrkuO2HuDnFDBoKA.png"" /><figcaption>The Beatles, Magical Mystery Tour (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/de/title/tt0061937/mediaviewer/rm1950683648/"">source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Please don’t be enraged. Take a deep breath and think about it.</p><p>Ever since the first AI tools with strong visual output started emerging, we seemingly overnight started screaming from all rooftops about:</p><p><strong><em>taste</em></strong>.</p><h4>What the fck is taste?</h4><p><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/taste-vs-technical-skills-ai/"">According to NNG</a> it’s “the learned, subjective ability to discern and select the most effective, harmonious, and high-quality elements for a project”.</p><p>Maybe, if you’re really smart, you can picture what that means. But really, if you’re honest, taste is a vague concept. Taste is subjective. Taste is not something that makes a product win (for the most part).</p><p>And vague is not <em>good</em> — especially not in a time of transformation where no one really knows where we’re going yet. Where tech stacks are changing weekly, and user needs are developing at rocket speed.</p><p>You know what else <em>vague</em> is bad for? Convincing an executive to invest in something.</p><p>It generally takes three things to grab an executive's attention.</p><ol><li>Connection (Do you get their problem?).</li><li>Authority (Do you know your stuff?).</li><li>Vision (Do you know where this is going?).</li></ol><p>Taste doesn’t answer any of those. You know what else doesn’t?</p><h4>Shitty prototypes.</h4><p>Yeah, I’ve made my fair share of them, too. But the time when these impressed anyone is over. Even my 0% designer husband can now vibe code stuff and knows how to whip up a design prototype.</p><p>There is a time and place for them. Prototypes and vibe-coded projects are great to show a vision, build excitement, or unblock a team that’s stuck in process. But they’re not what’s gonna convince your engineering stakeholders to give you access to their codebase so you can actually start shipping fixes from your design backlog.</p><p>I’d like to argue that excessive prototyping is the next big issue that’s messing with the status of design in the age of AI.</p><p>Because they undermine our authority. There’s the executive’s next red flag. <em>Do you know your stuff?</em></p><p>Of course, designers recognised this concern quickly. How did we respond?</p><p>By starting never-ending discussions about:</p><p><strong><em>craft</em>.</strong></p><h4>What the heck is craft?</h4><p>I like <a href=""https://www.nsead.org/resources/teaching-inspiration/craft/defining-craft/"">this definition</a>: “Craft can be defined as intelligent making. It is technically, materially and culturally informed. Craft is the designing and making of individual artefacts and objects, encouraging the development of intellectual, creative and practical skills, visual sensitivity and a working knowledge of tools, materials and systems”.</p><p>Welp.</p><p><em>Taste and craft walk into a bar…</em></p><p>Just kidding.</p><p>You get my point. Here is another vague concept that most people associate with activities they liked to do back in kindergarten.</p><p>And listen, I’m not knocking craft. I love writing poetry, painting, throwing pots at the wheel. All that takes craft and skill, just as my designs at work do. But craft should be so obvious to us as designers that we should not make it our <em>main</em> selling point.</p><p>Obviously, we develop incredible craft as our experience builds. Obviously, individual designers have different styles. Obviously, we put thought and care into what we make.</p><p>Craft is the baseline. That’s what we want the executives to know. By debating it and what it even means, we’re again undermining our authority. And I’d argue we’re also not really connecting with them OR showing much vision.</p><p>Well, shit.</p><p><strong>How do we get out of this mess?</strong></p><p>We need to remember — and remind others — why design is irreplaceable.</p><h4>We’re the OG makers.</h4><p>We’re “growth mindset”, personified.</p><p>In most classic product companies, there are <a href=""https://www.producttalk.org/glossary-discovery-product-trio/"">trios</a>: A product manager, a designer, and an engineer. The point?

<h4>The shallowness of the “empathy machine.”</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*5waTlYqbHeJwFdxz"" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=""https://unsplash.com/@silverkblack?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Vitaly Gariev</a> on <a href=""https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>I once saw a “poverty simulation” designed to help raise funds and “put people in others’ shoes.” I felt… weird. Can you imagine someone going through a 10-minute fancy VR experience and suddenly claiming they understand the struggles?</p><p>VR allows users to step into any experience from a first-person perspective. Some people call it an “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXHil1TPxvA\"">empathy machine</a>” and argue that it could influence decision-makers. I bought into it at first. However, after going through several simulations, I noticed that no matter how moved I was in the moment, none of it led to any real behavioral change.</p><p>Is it just me? Or is this “trigger empathy and cause behavioral change” design goal too impractical and overhyped?</p><h3>Why do people believe that VR can trigger empathy?</h3><p>VR allows users to inhabit avatars, and their brains might start believing that the virtual body is theirs (<a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.814565/full"">researchers</a> call this “sense of embodiment”). Some designers believe this can <strong>encourage perspective-taking, reduce implicit bias, and eventually induce empathy.</strong></p><p>In theory, it makes sense. But in reality, this assumption is too ideal and shallow. First, your brain isn’t that easy to trick. A tiny glitch — a slight delay between movement and render, or weird skin texture — will remind you it’s fake. More importantly, embodiment alone is just a shallow representation of identity. For example, putting users in a Black body doesn’t give them hundreds of years of history or lived experience. It doesn’t make them part of the Black community, and it certainly won’t create sustainable empathy.</p><h3>What is empathy, exactly?</h3><p>This word seems a bit abstract, so let’s define it better here. When <a href=""https://tmb.apaopen.org/pub/vr-improves-emotional-empathy-only/release/2"">researchers </a>and designers discuss empathy, they’re usually talking about two different kinds: <strong>emotional </strong>and <strong>cognitive</strong>.</p><p>Emotional empathy is immediate and direct, like seeing someone in pain makes you feel discomfort too. Cognitive empathy goes deeper. It’s when you actively try to understand someone’s mental state and decision-making process, and this kind of empathy is what usually leads to behavioral change.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AiXVB-J8JEHS2BtKZ3n9VA.png"" /></figure><p>VR is pretty good at triggering emotional empathy because it provides users with intense sensory information. But the reaction doesn’t last. For me, it usually starts fading about 10 minutes after removing the headset. I think the problem is that while I’m in the experience, I’m so overwhelmed by everything I’m sensing that I can’t actually think about what the character is going through mentally.<strong> Without that deeper engagement, cognitive empathy never gets triggered.</strong></p><h3><strong>VR’s shallow content</strong></h3><p>Beyond sensory overload, VR simulations lack the depth needed for cognitive empathy.</p><p>The content is often shallow. Let’s compare it with other storytelling media: movies and books are usually built on years of research and interviews, while VR simulations prioritize technical execution, focusing on realistic graphics and interactions over storytelling depth. <strong>Users often end up distracted by the novelty of technology instead of engaging with the issues.</strong></p><p>Time is another constraint. Most VR simulations run under 10 minutes, which isn’t enough to convey background or context. Understanding social issues often requires hours of learning and engagement just to grasp the basics. However, creating longer experiences isn’t practical either because VR headsets are bulky and uncomfortable, and the sensory intensity creates fatigue quickly.</p><h3><strong>When VR simulation might work</strong></h3><p>VR probably isn’t the best tool for creating sustainable empathy or long-term behavioral change. However, it can still be effective when applied with clear, specific design goals instead of vague “triggering empathy” objectives.</p><p>Take healthcare training for example. <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6148621/"">Research </a>shows that medical students better understand conditions like Alzheimer’s through VR, improving their compassionate care. It works because <strong>VR complements their existing education.</strong> These students already study these topics extensively through patient shadowing, workshops, and reflective practice.</p><p>Unlike general audiences with no background, these students approach VR with clear learning objectives. They know they’re not trying to “feel like” elderly patients but learning to recognize specific physical symptoms. They’re less likely to get distracted by the technology and can navigate the experience better. The actual empathy develops later, when they interact with real patients.</p><p>No one can really “walk in others’ shoes.” Empathy is a complex emotion. Social issues are far more complicated than any simulation can capture, and technology only scratches the surface: loud explosions simulate sound, not fear. Disorientation replicates physical sensations, not the psychological toll of experiencing it every day.</p><p>New technology isn’t always the shortcut to the solution. Real perspective-taking requires a more time-consuming traditional approach: engaging with communities, reading, and listening. As a developer, I try to remember these limitations instead of chasing technology hype with vague, overambitious goals.</p><h3>Reference:</h3><ol><li>Milk, C. [TED]. (2015).

<h4>How consumer security products turn physical presence into assumed consent</h4><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a Ring-style doorbell camera watching people in a shared neighbourhood space."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BJZf6ZZrNZDCKe6Iz76Jrw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Illustration of a home security camera extending its gaze into shared neighbourhood space, symbolising the shift from private protection to ambient surveillance. <strong><em>Image generated using Grok Imagine.</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p>When <a href=""https://ring.com/eu/en"">Amazon’s Ring</a> aired its <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OheUzrXsKrY""><em>Search Party</em> advertisement</a> during the Super Bowl, it presented a reassuring narrative: neighbours’ cameras cooperate, a missing dog is found, and communal order is restored. The unease the advert provoked did not stem from its goal. It arose from its premise, namely that individuals can be enrolled into a neighbourhood-scale, real-time AI <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24070846/amazon-ring-search-party-super-bowl-ad-privacy-backlash"">surveillance network</a> without ever explicitly consenting to participate.</p><p>Within days, Ring terminated its planned partnership with <a href=""https://www.flocksafety.com/"">Flock Safety</a>, a company criticised for operating large-scale <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2026/02/17/nx-s1-5612825/flock-contracts-canceled-immigration-survillance-concerns"">automated licence plate recognition systems</a> used by <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/12/effs-investigations-expose-flock-safetys-surveillance-abuses-2025-review"">US law enforcement</a>. Ring cited <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy8dxz1g7zo"">implementation complexity</a>. The timing suggests a more candid explanation. The partnership made visible a widening gap between what surveillance technologies enable and what the public is prepared to tolerate.</p><p>This episode illustrates a defining feature of contemporary AI deployment. Individuals are no longer incorporated primarily as deliberate users; they are absorbed as ambient data contributors. Consent is not requested. It is inferred from physical presence. And when the implications of that inference become politically salient, withdrawal tends to be tactical rather than principled.</p><h3>When presence becomes participation</h3><p>Ring’s <em>Search Party</em> feature queries nearby cameras when a missing pet is reported. As <a href=""https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-demands-amazon-abandon-plan-to-include-facial-recognition-technology-in-ring-doorbells"">Senator Ed Markey observed</a>, this closely resembles neighbourhood-scale surveillance infrastructure. Crucially, <em>Search Party</em> does not operate in isolation. Ring’s <a href=""https://ring.com/support/articles/z3yhg/familiar-faces""><em>Familiar Faces</em></a> feature applies facial recognition to anyone passing within camera range, continuously scanning and categorising faces without their explicit knowledge or agreement.</p><figure><img alt=""Smartphone screen showing Ring’s Search Party interface asking a user to verify whether their camera footage matches a reported missing dog."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*RkS0GTIqXOE7qOGO.jpg"" /><figcaption>Ring’s Search Party interface prompts users to verify footage from their cameras, illustrating how neighbourhood-scale surveillance continues through everyday product features. <strong>Image source: </strong><a href=""https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/ring-search-party-for-dogs-united-states-missing-pets""><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong>.</strong></figcaption></figure><p>Combined, these capabilities enable tracking across residential space through distributed, privately owned sensors. The system no longer merely secures private property. It facilitates continuous monitoring of public movement.</p><p>The central tension lies in default inclusion. Neighbours are not asked whether their footage should be analysed for AI searches. Passers-by are not consulted before their biometric features are processed. Cameras function as environmental infrastructure, and physical presence alone becomes sufficient grounds for enrolment.</p><p><strong>This is not informed consent. It is participation assumed through exposure.</strong></p><p>Yuval Noah Harari captures this historical inversion precisely in <a href=""https://www.ynharari.com/book/nexus/""><em>Nexus</em></a>:</p><p><em>“In a world where humans monitored humans, privacy was the default.”</em></p><p>In sensor-saturated environments, <strong>the opposite is now true</strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""Cover images of Yuval Noah Harari’s book Nexus, titled “A Brief History of Information Networks from the Stone Age to AI”."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*iaX961XQIJtbLeHh.jpg"" /><figcaption>Cover of <em>Nexus</em> by Yuval Noah Harari, which examines the historical shift from human-to-human monitoring to large-scale information networks. <strong>Image source:</strong> <a href=""https://www.ynharari.com/book/nexus/"">Yuval Noah Harari, official website.</a></figcaption></figure><h3>The normalisation of suspicion</h3><p>The problem is not only technical but social. Platforms such as Ring’s <a href=""https://apps.apple.com/us/app/neighbors-by-ring/id1218902777""><em>Neighbours</em> app</a> have reformatted the neighbourhood watch into what critics describe as participatory mass surveillance. Real-time alerts about “suspicious activity” gamify vigilance, rewarding users who flag anomalies in their surroundings.</p><p>The consequences are not evenly distributed. Research consistently shows that people of colour are disproportionately labelled as suspicious on these platforms. What begins as a private perception becomes a data point: timestamped, geotagged, and <em>potentially</em> routed toward <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/16/amazon-ring-cameras-surveillance-law-enforcement-crime-police-investigations.html"">police response</a>. The technology does not create implicit bias, but it institutionalises it, converting individual prejudice into operational logic.</p><p>When private cameras become the mechanism by which those biases trigger formal intervention, the question of <strong>who gets watched, and who gets to watch</strong>, becomes a civil rights issue rather than a consumer preference.</p><h3>The Infrastructure of Inevitable Surveillance</h3><p>The abandoned Flock Safety partnership reveals how such systems scale institutionally. The proposed integration could have allowed police departments to <a href=""https://www.cnet.com/home/security/amazons-ring-cameras-push-deeper-into-police-and-government-surveillance/"">request Ring footage</a> through Flock’s platform, following a <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1080/01972243.2015.1107166"">familiar trajectory</a> in which consumer products evolve into mechanisms for data aggregation and institutional access.</p><p>This pipeline matters beyond the cancelled partnership. Where law enforcement lacks the legal grounds for neighbourhood-wide warrants, access to aggregated community camera data can serve a functionally equivalent role. Even when platforms restrict direct police access, data frequently travels through intermediaries whose business models involve selling location and behavioural data to government agencies operating well outside local democratic oversight.</p><p><strong>Cancelling one visible integration does not seal the pipeline. It merely reroutes it.</strong></p><p>Ring’s transformation from consumer hardware to data-centric platform makes this structural rather than accidental. When one person installs a camera, they consent on their own behalf. That camera nonetheless captures neighbours, delivery workers, and passers-by. As camera density increases, opting out becomes practically impossible, since avoidance requires withdrawal from shared space altogether. At that point, consent functions largely as theatre.</p><p>Harari notes that in 2023 more than <strong>one billion CCTV cameras</strong> were operative globally, roughly <strong>one for every eight people</strong>. Surveillance is no longer exceptional. <a href=""https://wifitalents.com/cctv-surveillance-industry-statistics/"">It is infrastructural.</a></p><h3>The security paradox</h3><p>There is also a pragmatic argument against centralised surveillance systems that receives less attention than it deserves: they are extraordinarily attractive targets for attack.</p><p>Aggregating millions of home cameras into a unified platform creates not only a privacy risk but a security one. A successful breach of a centralised AI hub would grant attackers what security researchers call <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/12/10/369740829/forget-creepy-nunbergs-word-of-the-year-is-bigger-and-two-god-view""><em>god-view</em> access</a>: real-time visibility into private residences across entire cities. Footage intended to protect households becomes the means by which those households are exposed.</p><p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/23/amazon-ring-camera-hack-lawsuit-threats"">Ring itself experienced security breaches in its early years</a>, including incidents in which attackers accessed cameras and harassed residents. Those were isolated failures. The risk posed by fully centralised systems, in which aggregation, AI analysis, and institutional access converge, is categorically larger.</p><p><a href=""https://kijero.com/blog/post/cctv-cameras-with-cloud-storage-vs-local-storage#:~:text=Privacy%20is%20one%20of%20the,data%20as%20you%20see%20fit."">Security researchers have long argued</a> that local storage, where footage remains within the home rather than uploaded to corporate servers, is the only architecture that eliminates this class of risk entirely. The dominance of cloud-based models reflects economic incentives tied to data extraction, not technical necessity.</p><h3>Beyond naive data optimism</h3><p>Harari describes the <em>naive view of information</em> as the belief that <a href=""https://medium.com/credtent-on-content/the-naive-view-of-engagement-why-more-isnt-better-c4b3227c7b6d"">more data naturally yields better outcomes</a>, while ignoring how power and incentives shape its use. Ring’s AI features exemplify this assumption. Expanded footage access and continuous biometric analysis are framed as unambiguous improvements to safety, while questions of agency, governance, and asymmetrical control receive minimal attention.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram showing information leading to truth, which then branches toward either wisdom or power."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OdHvYopGD6Fr5bADW_sRwg.png"" /><figcaption><strong>Diagram from <em>Nexus</em> by Yuval Noah Harari</strong> illustrating the naive assumption that more information naturally leads to truth and better outcomes, while in practice diverging toward either wisdom or power.</figcaption></figure><p>The proposed Flock integration made this logic explicit. Convenience justified infrastructure. Infrastructure produced data. Data became the substrate for AI analysis and policing. The progression reflects economic alignment rather than malicious intent, but the outcome is the same regardless.</p><h3>Making consent meaningful again</h3><p>The challenge is not whether AI should exist in sensor-rich environments. It is how legitimacy is established in spaces that are collectively experienced.</p><p>Three governance approaches already exist and could be implemented without delay.</p><p>First, <strong>default opt-in rather than opt-out</strong>. AI surveillance features should require active, informed activation. <a href=""https://medium.com/@www.manuelmiles/the-psychology-of-defaults-79d492bc99cc"">Behavioural research shows that most users never alter default settings.</a> Reversing this would not restrict the technology; it would make participation genuinely voluntary.</p><p>Second, <strong>community-level governance</strong>. Municipal oversight bodies can determine which capabilities are permissible within neighbourhoods, under what conditions, and with what limits on data retention. Legally constituted community trusts could require approval and independent auditing for third-party and law-enforcement partnerships.</p><p>Third, <strong>privacy-preserving technical architectures</strong>. Federated learning allows AI models to operate locally on devices without centralising raw data. A neighbourhood system built this way could detect unusual activity without footage ever leaving individual homes. These methods are already deployed in healthcare and finance. Their absence from consumer surveillance products reflects incentive structures, not technical limits.</p><h3>From retreat to redesign</h3><p>Ring’s retreat from the Flock Safety partnership does not resolve the underlying problem. The cameras remain installed. The AI capabilities persist. Partnerships can be quietly reconfigured through different intermediaries. The infrastructure endures.</p><p><a href=""http://10.5772/intechopen.1011457"">This pattern extends far beyond Ring</a>. Smart-city CCTV, mobile location tracking, and digital health monitoring follow the same trajectory. Presence becomes participation. Consent becomes assumed. Public concern produces episodic retreats, not structural change. The systems remain intact.</p><p>The question, then, is not whether AI inevitably erodes human agency. It is whether we continue to permit systems to treat mere presence as default input rather than as a condition requiring collective authorisation. In sensor-saturated environments, individual consent loses its protective force. When biometric processing is continuous, public anonymity erodes invisibly. When surveillance infrastructure is centralised, a single breach can undo every promise of safety on which the system was sold.</p><p>Crucially, these systems do not meaningfully self-correct through public discomfort alone. Left unconstrained, data-driven infrastructures expand until legitimacy breaks, at which point withdrawal becomes reputational rather than corrective. Ring’s retreat is best understood not as a resolution, but as a pressure release.</p><p>If AI is to be deployed in the name of safety, it must be governed with mechanisms equal to its reach: transparency that is operational rather than rhetorical, collective decision-making rather than individualised settings, and enforceable limits that bind platforms as tightly as they bind users. What is required are structures that prevent legitimacy crises from accumulating in the first place, rather than relying on backlash to correct them after the fact.</p><p>In environments where visibility has become the default, the task is not to abandon AI. <strong>It is to redesign it so that consent becomes meaningful again: deliberate rather than incidental, collective rather than individual, enforceable rather than assumed.</strong></p><p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aflucas26/""><strong>Andrea Filiberto Lucas</strong></a> is a <a href=""https://www.um.edu.mt/profile/andreaflucas"">Research Support Officer</a> and MSc student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Malta.

<h4>Most AI features fail because they start with hype, not humans.</h4><figure><img alt=""Blurred office scene with a humanoid robot seated across from a man at a desk. Overlaid headline reads, “Why Most AI Products Fail Before the First User Interaction,” with a visible “Save This” button."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JUhjp2-rcUq3oOaZl9Vt4g.png"" /><figcaption>Image Credit: AI Generated Image</figcaption></figure><p>Most AI products fail before the first user interaction because they don’t solve a real user problem. That may sound dramatic, but I keep hearing the same sentence in executive rooms: “We need an AI feature. Our competitor just launched one.” And just like that, features are built out of fear of being left behind rather than from a clear understanding of what users actually need.</p><p>And this isn’t just my opinion. Recently, I came across a report titled <a href=""https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2680-1.html"">The Root Causes of Failure for Artificial Intelligence Projects and How They Can Succeed</a> by RAND.</p><p>The researchers interviewed 65 experienced data scientists and engineers who have spent years building AI and machine learning systems. Their goal was simple: understand why so many AI initiatives fail and what differentiates the few that succeed.</p><p>One of their core conclusions is striking. The most successful AI projects focus relentlessly on the problem they are meant to solve, not on the technology used to solve it. That sentence could have come straight out of an UX strategy deck.</p><p>Designers have been trained for decades to understand users and their problems before building solutions. What if AI projects are struggling not because of the models, but because design thinking was missing from the room?</p><h3>Building AI products for the mere sake of tech</h3><p>I see many companies building and releasing AI products because they feel they have to (often because their competitor just launched a tool with “AI” in the name), rather than because they’ve identified a real user need.</p><p>This appears to be a major trend, so it doesn’t surprise me to read what, for some, may be shocking statistics: Gartner predicts that <a href=""https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-06-25-gartner-predicts-over-40-percent-of-agentic-ai-projects-will-be-canceled-by-end-of-2027""><strong>more than 40% of agentic AI projects</strong></a> will be canceled by the end of 2027. The reasons for failure cited are escalating costs, unclear business value, and inadequate risk controls. Their own analyst called it out directly: most of these projects are early-stage experiments driven by hype and often misapplied.</p><p>Gartner also estimates that only about 130 of the thousands of agentic AI vendors out there offer genuine capabilities. The rest are engaging in what they call “agent washing,” just rebranding chatbots and RPA tools as something they’re not.</p><p>When everything is AI-powered, nothing is AI-powered. The label becomes meaningless. Companies end up with a product that technically “has AI” but solves no real problem for anyone.</p><figure><img alt=""Blurred office background with bold text stating, “40% of agentic AI products will be canceled by the end of 2027.” Source noted as Gartner 2025."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oN8afkLbaGy1LtQcg6dMjw.png"" /></figure><h3>The “not having the right people” problem</h3><p>The data scientists and engineers who were interviewed for the RAND report (cited in the article’s introduction) say it’s challenging to find the right talent for AI projects.</p><p>Hiring skilled specialists is an issue, but also how organizations value the talent they already have. Data engineers, the people doing the hard work of cleaning and structuring data so models can learn from it, are treated like second-class citizens. One interviewee literally called them “the plumbers of data science.”</p><p>So they leave. And when they leave, they take all their institutional knowledge with them. No one knows which datasets are reliable anymore; projects stall, and leadership loses interest.</p><p>What about designers? Most AI teams don’t even have one. Or they bring one in at the tail end, when the model is already built, and someone realizes the interface is unusable. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/designers-vs-developers-wrong-fight-age-ai-arin-bhowmick-ja5af""><strong>Designers and developers depend on each other more than ever</strong></a> and should be at the table from day one when building any product, especially those with AI features.</p><p>To support my views and opinions on the topic, I cited a <a href=""https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/when-ai-joins-the-team-better-ideas-surface""><strong>2025 field experiment at Harvard Business School</strong></a> that found that AI-augmented cross-functional teams were three times more likely to generate high-performing ideas than individuals working alone. The designer-developer divide is precisely the kind of silo that the experiment suggests we should break down. And so is the data engineer vs. data scientist one. Different roles, same problem: the people getting sidelined are often the ones who could have “saved” the project, or, at least, brought the most clarity to it.</p><h3>What we can do as design leaders</h3><p>The RAND report focuses on AI/ML model development rather than product design. But the failures they describe, miscommunication, unclear goals, and users as an afterthought, are the same ones killing AI products today. There’s a golden opportunity for <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/what-design-leaders-must-unlearn-to-lead-in-an-ai-first-world-f131652f828d"">design leaders to step into that gap.</a></p><p>Here’s how should move forward:</p><h4>Be THE communicators</h4><p>Industry stakeholders often misunderstand or miscommunicate what problem needs to be solved using AI. Design leaders have a unique opportunity to be the missing link that bridges communication between key stakeholders and software engineers, data scientists, and other AI technologists. We’ve been closely working with them for years building products, so we are the ones who know better how to communicate the right specs. We speak the same language.</p><h4>Follow the one-year rule</h4><p>RAND’s report says that before they begin any AI project, leaders should be prepared to commit each product team to solving a specific problem for at least a year. If an AI project is not worthy of such a long-term commitment, it most likely is not worth committing to at all, especially because an AI project with an overly accelerated timeline is likely to fail without ever achieving its intended goal. Designers are essential for creating products people want to use, so this rule extends to our teams. We need that time for research, testing, iterating, and validating. You can’t design a meaningful AI experience in a two-week sprint.</p><h4>Put the problem statement on the wall, not the tech stack</h4><p>The AI products that succeed are those focused on the problem they are meant to solve. As design leaders, we should be the ones writing the problem statement that guides the entire project. What I mean by this is a clear, human-centered problem statement that everyone, from the CTO to the junior data engineer, can rally around.</p><h4>Own the workflow mapping</h4><p>One of the most common failure patterns mentioned in the RAND report is building an AI model that doesn’t fit into the business workflow. It works in isolation but breaks when it meets reality. That’s design territory, because we are trained to map user journeys, service blueprints, and task flows. We see where an AI feature fits into someone’s day, and where it doesn’t. If we’re mapping these workflows before the engineering team starts building, we save the entire project from that painful moment when a technically sound model turns out to be operationally useless.</p><h4>Ask, “Do we need AI for this?”</h4><p>Not every problem requires AI. As design leaders, we should have the confidence to ask the uncomfortable questions. Sometimes the best design decision is the simplest one, and saying “this doesn’t need AI, it needs a better interface” might be the most valuable contribution you make to the entire project.</p><figure><img alt=""A group of designers and developers gathered around a whiteboard labeled “Problem Statement.” One man presents while pointing to sticky notes and diagrams, as others sit at computer workstations listening and collaborating."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Kxik8bvZ0dJw4JFZuGmFYw.png"" /><figcaption>Image Credit: AI Generated Image</figcaption></figure><h3>The missing piece to AI product success</h3><p>Designers and engineers focused on solving real user problems. That is how we build AI products that genuinely improve people’s lives.</p><p>The gap between what companies say they want AI to achieve and what users actually need is a design leadership issue. To achieve real success, we must reframe the conversation from shiny new features to solving real user problems.</p><p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arinb""><em>Arin Bhowmick</em></a><em> (</em><a href=""https://twitter.com/arinbhowmick""><em>@arinbhowmick</em></a><em>) is Chief Design Officer at SAP, based in San Francisco, California.

The article I wrote last month — was written with Claude. This one too. Not by Claude. With Claude. And the difference between those two words is what I want to unpack here.</p><p>Both pieces were written using instructions. Instructions I created. Instructions I am continuing to hone — instructions that required me to study my own old essays, identifying what I do when I write. The sentence rhythms. The way I move between timescales. The zooming in and out from concept to detail. The instructions tell Claude how I would like ideas composed. I pull together concepts and experiences from my lived expertise to formulate a point of view — in this case, on this new AI technology we are all metabolizing into our lives and work. For this piece, we’ve gone back-and-forth eleven times to get to this published draft. I rework most sentences but not all.</p><p>This is a powerful and highly personalizable tool. Not the output. The instruction.</p><p>/</p><p>Christopher Alexander published <em>A Pattern Language</em> in 1977. Two hundred and fifty-three patterns — from the scale of entire regions down to the placement of a doorknob — each one describing a recurring problem in the built environment and offering the core of a solution. Pattern 159: Light on Two Sides of Every Room. Pattern 88: Street Cafe. Pattern 252: Pools of Light. The patterns are specific, tested, structural. They give you a system.</p><p>But Alexander was never interested in just the system. He was interested in what he called “the quality without a name” — something alive, whole, experienced — that emerges when patterns are followed well but can never be reduced to logic alone. He tried word after word to capture it. None were sufficient. The quality resists naming. It can only be felt.</p><p>I studied such phenomena at the University of Pennsylvania. Architecture history and theory. I spent countless hours thinking about the relationship between ideas on form and proportion, the structures created from those ideas, and the life that happens inside of them. My final thesis examined how concepts of nature in urban theory shape the way we read and design cities. Three canonical texts on urbanism, three entirely different readings of the same city, because each began with a different understanding of what was “natural.” The foundational mental models we carry into a problem structure everything that follows.</p><p>Attunement to that tension has stayed with me. The pattern is the structure. The pattern came from distilling ideas and experiences. But what makes a place — what makes any made thing — feel alive is something the pattern enables but does not contain.</p><p>What I am uncovering — and what has been genuinely surprising — twenty years later and in an entirely different medium, is that the same tension lives inside the instructions we write for AI.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ut-R4ivcHKM9dNChdr_b1Q.png"" /><figcaption><em>In this collage: Instructions from “A Pattern Language” — Pattern 128, Indoor Sunlight; photograph of Fallingwater; covers of Collage City (Rowe &amp; Koetter), Architecture of the City (Rossi), S,M,L,XL (Koolhaas).</em> <em>Image credit: Christopher Alexander, A Pattern Language, Oxford University Press, 1977 (pattern excerpt); personal photograph (Fallingwater, 2005); book covers from Collage City, The Architecture of the City, and S,M,L,XL used for educational reference.</em></figcaption></figure><p>/</p><p>I used to write a lot. I have stacks of essays no one will ever read. But they sharpened something — the way I pull ideas together, the way I form very long sentences, the way I know in my intuition, not my intellect, when something lands.</p><p>Then life happened. Architecture for eight-ish years, a pivot into product design for the past ten-ish, two kids. Most days I vacillate between corporate theater, recreating K-pop demon hunter hairstyles, long conversations with engineers to grok the technical enough to translate it into the experiential, and putting nutritious meals on the table that go largely underappreciated. Between all this life, I still had ideas I wanted to better formulate with words. I craved that time at a carrel stacked with texts in a library — putting concepts together into an essay, hard-coding what I was feeling into a cohesive perspective. But the hours for that type of work had disappeared. The practice of writing had largely gone quiet.</p><p>So I ran an experiment. I took writing I loved — my own writing, from when I had the time to be careful with it — and I fed it to Claude. Not to generate new text. To analyze. This was my exact prompt:</p><blockquote>“I want you to look at these articles I wrote and analyze the writing mechanics I used in them to create instructions for this project space. I will write several articles in this project and I want them to sound like me and leverage some of the things I did in these articles and apply them to articles in the future.”</blockquote><p>What Claude identified was a penchant for varying sentence lengths. Shocking, right? Moving back and forth in time — from cave paintings at Lascaux, 40,000 BC, to Haegue Yang, a South Korean sculptor working in installation today. The “/” section breaks I use instead of headers. The way I embed lists in prose rather than bullets. The em dashes that let me think sideways mid-sentence — which I get called out for at work as a negative, but get to trademark as an aesthetic signature here.</p><p>A pattern language for <em>my</em> writing.</p><p>I don’t use that phrase flippantly. Because what I found myself holding was exactly what Alexander described: a collection of recurring solutions to recurring problems of expression, each one specific enough to be actionable but open enough to generate infinite variation. Not a template. Not a formula. A language — in the Alexandrian sense — that I can use to build something that feels like mine even when I am not building it alone.</p><p>This move — from intuitive practice to explicit instruction — is something designers in the field are increasingly grappling with. In a thoughtful<a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/a-ux-designer-guide-to-prompt-f045cd839489""> UX Collective piece on prompting as design craft</a>, Paz Perez frames prompting not as a trick for getting AI to comply, but as the new medium through which designers articulate intent: “Effective communication, whether with people or machines, depends on context.” She’s describing something deeper than prompt hygiene. She’s describing the need to externalize what we usually carry internally — the instinct, the judgment, the taste.</p><p>/</p><p>This changed something. Not because Claude now “writes like me” — that’s too simplified. It changed something because I now understand my own craft in a way I didn’t before. I can see the moves I make. I can name them.</p><p>Alexander wanted patterns to be legible to ordinary people — not just architects. When he interviewed for a position as head of the architecture department at Cambridge and was asked who his first hire would be, he said a carpenter. The panel pressed: which <em>named architect</em>? He persisted. Who after the carpenter? “A mason.” He didn’t get the job.</p><p>The point was radical to academics: the people who make things should understand the patterns they’re working with. The knowledge shouldn’t live with experts alone. It should be owned by the people who construct and inhabit the spaces.</p><p>That’s what happened when I extracted my writing patterns. The knowledge stopped being locked inside intuitive practice and became something I could hold, examine, refine. The instructions aren’t just for Claude. They’re for me — a mirror held up to accumulated craft.</p><p>The philosopher Michael Polanyi captured this asymmetry in a phrase — “We can know more than we can tell.” His point was that most sophisticated human skill is tacit — embedded in the body, in habit, in intuition — and therefore almost impossible to fully articulate. What I find remarkable about writing instructions for AI is that it forces exactly this kind of articulation. The tacit becomes explicit, not because the AI demands it, but because without that explicitness, the AI produces something competent and hollow. You have to tell it what you know.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-bFFsDcP6F0XSxBTYfz6sg.png"" /><figcaption><em>Collage includes: K-pop inspired hairstyle recreation; the Rosetta Stone; an illustration from Wired Magazine by Koma Zhang.</em> <em>Image credit: Personal photograph (hairstyle); The Rosetta Stone, © The Trustees of the British Museum; illustration by</em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/komaciel/""><em> Koma Zhang</em></a><em> for Wired Magazine.</em></figcaption></figure><p>/</p><p>My writing process these days is messy, but <em>it is happening</em>. I am always the first one up, before the kids are fully conscious, and I talk. Speech input — Wispr Flow into a Google Doc on my phone — putting ideas down while making breakfast or packing lunches. It gives my writing a spoken quality I actually prefer to what comes out when I type carefully. Then I bring those fragments to the Claude project space where my instructions are housed — along with other writings as context and memory — and we go back and forth. Claude generates a draft. I edit, weave concepts in and out, rewrite in a Google Doc, send it back. And so on. The AI holds the scaffolding; I do the building.</p><p>I want to be clear: this is not content generation. Not slop. I hope you are experiencing the difference.</p><p>Language is a technology. This is easy to forget because we are born into it, but it is one of the oldest and most sophisticated tools humans have ever developed — and some people have a mastery of it that I do not. My spelling is terrible. My punctuation, left to my own devices, is creative at best. But I know how I want something to feel. I know how I want it to land. And a large language model is not magic. It is human language, compressed. Billions of words written by people, distilled through neural networks into mathematical weights and probabilities — patterns of how language follows language, learned at a scale no individual could achieve. When I give it instructions drawn from my own writing, I am not outsourcing my voice. I am using the largest pattern-recognition engine ever built to help me stay faithful to patterns I already own but cannot always execute alone.</p><p>That’s what the instructions capture. Not rules. Sensibility. The pattern is the structure. What emerges — if the pattern is well crafted — is the quality without a name.</p><p>/</p><p>I was listening to the<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1KQRPtgiM0&amp;list=PLB9gMmtMLXxsa8C0PzHFL2tJFh7FrKrYD""> Hard Fork podcast</a> recently and they covered romance novel writers using AI. New York Times reporter Alexandra Alter talked about how the explosion of AI-assisted books has made one thing obvious: you need very specific instructions if you want anything convincing for the genre. There are tells. Phrases the models default to when you don’t guide them. AI is still bad at human emotion, at nuance, at the art of the slow burn. Apparently “he said her name like a ragged prayer” appears in book after book — a phrase the model’s weights favor heavily, surfacing again and again across novels by different AI-assisted authors. One prolific romance writer turned instructor, Carol Hart, tells her students to always add the LLM instruction: <em>make it slow and agonizing. Do not rush to the finish.</em></p><p>This made me laugh, but also made sense. The unguided, uninstructed output has a specific lack of texture. You can feel it. Competent and smooth and saying nothing of depth. Falling back on the same tricks. No quality without a name. It’s the architectural equivalent of a building that follows code but has no life in it — technically correct, humanly dead. Alexander spent his career fighting exactly this. The pattern exists to prevent it. The instruction exists to prevent it.</p><p>The craft is in the specificity. In the personal. In the particular.</p><p>Katy Neale, a UX designer who writes about the intersection of AI and practice, recently articulated this from the product design side. In<a href=""https://medium.com/@katyneale/prompt-engineering-is-the-new-ux-skill-b3a58cb00e14""> her piece on Medium</a>, she argues that prompt engineering is less a technical skill than a design skill — that it requires the same kind of user-contextual thinking designers already do, just applied to the AI system itself: “We’re not just learning a new tool — we’re discovering a fundamental skill that will define how humans interact with technology for decades to come.” She’s right. But I want to push it a little further: we’re not just communicating with the machine. We’re learning to articulate ourselves.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4JRJlDprL3QfPB0zl0SuZA.png"" /><figcaption>Collage includes: <em>A few example Topics with their corresponding Descriptions and Instructions from testing on a fictional shipping company called “ShipIT.”</em> <em>Image credit: Original documentation created by the author for AI testing purposes.</em></figcaption></figure><p>/</p><p>As you might imagine, I am finding deep resonance between this personal writing practice and my day job. I lead the design of an AI agent for customer service representatives. It helps reps resolve cases by generating step-by-step service plans grounded in a company’s actual policies, knowledge base, and case data. The quality of those plans depends almost entirely on one thing: the quality of the instructions.</p><p>In the system we’re working within, you write <em>topics</em> — categories that tell the agent what kind of case it’s looking at — and <em>instructions</em> — the specific guidance the agent should follow. Add a skill and those intructions can take actions. A topic might be “Return Request.” An instruction might be: “Make sure the customer has provided the required information, including a valid return date, customer name, and receipt or order number.” Another: “If the customer provides the order number, then search the return in the Order Management System using the order number and return date.” Simple language. Clear conditional logic. One task per instruction. If this, then that. Always, must, verify.</p><p>What we’re asking enterprise customers to do is exactly what Alexander proposed: build a pattern language. Each topic is a category. Each instruction is a pattern — a recurring problem paired with its solution, expressed clearly enough that anyone — or any reasoning engine — can apply it, but specific enough that what emerges is grounded in that company’s actual reality.</p><p>What I didn’t expect was what happens to companies in the process of writing those instructions. The act of articulating how your business works — clearly enough for a reasoning engine to follow — is a form of forced introspection. Organizations discover that processes they assumed were well-defined actually live in someone’s head, or differ team to team, or were never documented at all. You try to tell an agent how to handle a return and realize there <em>is</em> no documented policy for the edge case. You write an instruction for escalation and discover that different offices escalate differently and nobody has reconciled the approaches.</p><p>This connects to something knowledge management researchers have been tracking for decades: what Polanyi called tacit knowledge is precisely what organizations lose when experienced employees leave, and precisely what AI instruction-writing forces them to surface. Writing instructions isn’t just configuration. It is, as one research framework puts it, <em>externalization</em> — converting what has lived in practice into something that can be shared, reviewed, and refined. The same way extracting my writing patterns made my craft visible to me, writing AI instructions makes a company’s operational logic visible to itself.</p><p>And the testing is where the craft deepens. The word “artisan” has started circulating in conversations about developers working with AI agents — and it resonates. You write instructions, test them against hundreds of simulated interactions, review where the agent fails or drifts, trace its reasoning, refine, test again. It’s iterative and nondeterministic — you cannot predict the output the way you can with traditional software, because these are reasoning systems, not rule engines. Success requires a disposition toward experimentation, toward relationship with the system rather than control of it.</p><p>And like Alexander’s patterns, the best instructions generate something that exceeds them. A dynamic service plan that evolves in real time as new information arrives — creating resolution steps on the fly, checking whether an action can be automated, falling back to human guidance when it can’t. The instructions provide the structure. But the quality without a name — that lives in the encounter itself. How the customer experiences the company. How they feel treated. How what started as a support interaction begins to feel like relationship.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SuFqHJNASOGRrhdWcsRcVQ.png"" /><figcaption>Collage includes: <em>Diagram showing the flow of information from a voice call through an AI reasoning engine, through protocol identification, to the AI agent generating a service plan for the representative — with Ryoji Ikeda’s “data-verse 1” (2019) layered underneath.</em> <em>Image credit: Original process diagram by the author; Ryoji Ikeda, “data-verse 1,” 2019.

Joseph Pine II — the same thinker who gave us <em>The Experience Economy</em> — argues in his most recent work that we are entering what he calls the Transformation Economy. Goods, services, even memorable experiences are no longer enough. Customers want to change. They want to become healthier, more knowledgeable, more capable. They want to reach their aspirations. The highest form of economic value, Pine argues, is guiding that transformation.</p><p>I’ve been sitting with this idea because it sharpens everything I’ve been describing. If Pine is right — and I think he is — then the bar for enterprise instructions rises dramatically. It’s no longer enough to resolve a case or close a ticket. The instructions need to create structure for personalized experiences that move beyond traditional support. The interaction between a brand and its customer — at the point of contact, in the moment of need — becomes an opportunity not just for resolution but for growth.</p><p>This is where I think instruction-writing becomes intellectual property.</p><p>Just as I understand the mechanics of how I write — because I know how I want it to land — companies can understand how they want their brand to be experienced and begin to codify that into instructions. We used to have knowledge articles and training manuals. Static documents. One-size-fits-all. Now we have instructions that generate dynamic, adaptive experiences — addressing a specific person, a specific problem, in a specific moment. The interaction is repeatable in structure but unique in execution.</p><p>The companies that invest in the quality and depth of their instructions will differentiate themselves. Their instructions will reflect how deeply they understand their own customers, their own processes, their own values. That understanding — encoded into patterns clear enough for AI to follow but rich enough to feel alive — becomes a form of brand. Not brand as logo or tagline, but brand as experience. The felt quality of interacting with an organization that knows itself and knows what it wants for the people it serves.</p><p>The instruction set will be the IP. The craft of writing it will be the competitive advantage.</p><p>/</p><p>There’s a flip side. The explosion of content — writing, agents, messages, recommendations — is real. More people will use these tools, more output will flood every channel, and the question of how we digest it all doesn’t have an answer yet.</p><p>But I feel good about being able to formulate my thoughts in a way that feels like me. It’s using a technology built from human language to amplify the intelligence I already have. To carry ideas I would have lost in the noise of daily life. To maintain a practice of thinking that the full weight of living had nearly crowded out.</p><p>Alexander’s first book was called <em>Notes on the Synthesis of Form</em> — rigid, scientific, prescriptive. By the time he wrote <em>The Timeless Way of Building</em>, he’d moved toward something softer, more alive. He’d realized that the pattern was necessary but never sufficient. That the life in a building — or a sentence, or an AI-aided support interaction — comes from somewhere the pattern points to but cannot reach.</p><p>The craft of the instruction is the same. It’s the pattern you build so that something beyond the pattern can emerge. Know your own patterns. Name them. Refine them. Own them.</p><p>The craft is always yours. The instruction helps you remember.</p><p><em>This article was written with Claude using writing style instructions developed by analyzing previous work. I also drew on</em><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/a-ux-designer-guide-to-prompt-f045cd839489""><em> Paz Perez’s guide to prompting for UX designers</em></a><em> published in UX Collective,</em><a href=""https://medium.com/@katyneale/prompt-engineering-is-the-new-ux-skill-b3a58cb00e14""><em> Katy Neale’s writing on prompt engineering as a UX skill</em></a><em>, and the</em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1KQRPtgiM0&amp;list=PLB9gMmtMLXxsa8C0PzHFL2tJFh7FrKrYD""><em> Hard Fork podcast episode on AI-assisted romance writing</em></a><em>. Christopher Alexander’s pattern language framework is drawn from A Pattern Language (Oxford University Press, 1977) and The Timeless Way of Building (Oxford University Press, 1979). Michael Polanyi’s concept of tacit knowledge is from The Tacit Dimension (Doubleday, 1966). B.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960008.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings, you survived the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Aquarius Solar Eclipse</a> and the launch of the Year of the Fire Horse, and honestly… that was a lot. This week shifts the pace. We’re now fully <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">in Pisces Season</a>, and the assignment is simple but not easy: slow down. Go with the flow. Rest without guilt. Dream without immediately turning the dream into a five-step action plan. After last week’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/saturn-in-aries-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Saturn–Neptune conjunction</a>, many of you are receiving quiet downloads about where your energy actually belongs. Trust what’s coming through, even if it doesn’t look “productive” yet. Sitting with your feelings, journaling, meditating, or simply doing less is also progress. Pisces energy reminds us that clarity grows in still water.</p>



<p>On February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings the first reality check since the eclipse. First quarter moons tend to feel like roadblocks or tension points, moments where you realize that the intention you set now needs adjustment. Because this one is in Gemini, the medicine is flexibility. If something isn’t working, don’t double down out of stubbornness. Ask more questions. Look at the situation from another angle. Have the conversation. Pivot if needed. This is less about pushing harder and more about staying curious enough to find a smarter path forward.</p>



<p>Then on February 26th, Mercury shifts retrograde in Pisces, and the emotional weather gets… watery. Focus may feel slippery, timelines may blur, and your mind might drift into nostalgia, daydreams, or full cinematic flashbacks from the past. Miscommunications are possible, especially when feelings are implied instead of spoken clearly. But this retrograde has a gift: it’s powerful for emotional closure, forgiveness, creative reflection, and tying up loose ends your intuition already knows about. People from the past may resurface, memories may stir, and old feelings may ask for acknowledgment. Just remember: feel everything, but stay grounded. Not every emotion is a crisis… sometimes it’s just your heart clearing space for what’s next.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, this week feels like the emotional cool down after being spiritually and energetically “on stage” for most of the month. With the Saturn–Neptune conjunction freshly behind you, you may still be processing major identity downloads… who you are now, what you’re ready to commit to, and what version of you is officially retired. The first full week <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">of Pisces Season</a> asks you to move slower than usual, even if your instinct is to charge forward.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini may bring a mental speed bump… a conversation, decision, or piece of information that makes you rethink your next move. Don’t treat this as a setback. Gemini energy is about adjusting your approach, asking questions, and staying flexible rather than forcing clarity too quickly.</p>



<p>The tone turns even more inward on February 26th, when Mercury begins its retrograde in Pisces, activating your realm of healing, rest, and spiritual closure. As February wraps up, you may feel more introspective, nostalgic, or emotionally sensitive than usual. Old memories, dreams, or unresolved feelings could surface, not to overwhelm you, but to be released. This is a powerful time to unplug, journal, meditate, and tie up emotional loose ends rather than pushing new plans forward. After a month of intense visibility and transformation, the real alignment now comes from solitude and softness. Think of this as your energetic reset before your season arrives.</p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, the first full week <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">of Pisces Season</a> shifts your focus toward connection, community, and your long-term vision for the future. You may feel more emotionally attuned to your friendships, social circles, or online spaces, noticing who feels aligned with the person you’re becoming and who doesn’t quite match your energy anymore. This is a softer, more heart-centered time for collaboration and dreaming with others.</p>



<p>However, on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini activates your money and self-worth zone, bringing a potential reality check around finances, pricing your value, or how much energy you’re giving compared to what you’re receiving. If a small obstacle shows up, don’t panic. Gemini energy asks you to stay flexible, explore options, and adjust your strategy rather than taking it personally.</p>



<p>Things may feel a bit more fluid and unpredictable starting February 26th, when Mercury goes retrograde in Pisces for three weeks. Miscommunications with friends, shifting group dynamics, or social media and tech hiccups are possible. You might even feel the urge to step back from certain platforms or take a break from being constantly available. This retrograde isn’t here to disrupt your peace, it’s here to help you reassess where your energy truly belongs. If plans change or connections feel unclear, resist the urge to control every outcome. Some things are meant to realign on their own. Your job is simply to stay grounded in your values and let the right circles reveal themselves.</p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, the first full week <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">of Pisces Season</a> puts your career, reputation, and long-term direction in the spotlight, but in a softer, more reflective way than you might expect. You may feel more emotionally connected to your work, questioning whether your current path actually aligns with your purpose, not just your skills.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in your sign brings a personal checkpoint. This can feel like a moment of pressure, a decision point, or a sudden realization about how you’re showing up professionally and personally. If something feels like a roadblock, don’t rush to push through it. This is Gemini energy at its best when you pause, gather more information, and adjust your approach rather than forcing a single outcome.</p>



<p>The tone shifts on February 26th, when your ruling planet Mercury shifts retrograde in Pisces. As February wraps up, you may find yourself rethinking a professional goal, reconsidering a public role, or feeling the need to slow down rather than chase the next opportunity. This isn’t the ideal time to launch brand new pitches, apply impulsively for roles, or make major career commitments unless the process began before the retrograde. Instead, think of this as a strategic review period. You’re refining your trajectory, not falling behind. The more honest you are about what success actually looks like for you now, the clearer your next move will be when Mercury moves forward again.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955474.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cancer, as a moon-ruled sign, you’re still feeling the energetic aftershocks of last week’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Aquarius solar eclipse</a> more strongly than most. Eclipses tend to activate your emotional radar, and you may be entering this week feeling heightened, reflective, or aware that something internally has shifted. Now that the cosmic intensity is settling, the first full week of Pisces Season offers a welcome emotional flow. Pisces energy supports your growth, faith, and long-term vision, helping you reconnect with hope after a period of major internal processing.</p>



<p>That sense of forward momentum meets a checkpoint on February 24th, when the First Quarter Moon in Gemini activates your rest, closure, and mental health zone. This can feel like a temporary pause or emotional speed bump, especially if you’ve been pushing yourself to “figure everything out.” You may need more sleep, quiet time, or space away from noise and expectations. Gemini energy here isn’t asking you to solve anything immediately, it’s encouraging you to listen to your inner dialogue and release mental clutter before taking your next step.</p>



<p>The pace shifts further inward on February 26th, when Mercury begins its retrograde in Pisces in your expansion realm for the next three weeks. Plans related to travel, education, publishing, entrepreneurship, or big-picture goals may need to be revisited, delayed, or adjusted. Instead of forcing new launches or committing to major long-term decisions, use this time to refine your vision. You may rediscover an old idea, reconnect with a previous opportunity, or realize your direction needs a slight pivot. This retrograde isn’t blocking your growth, it’s making sure your next leap is aligned with who you’re becoming.</p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, you’re entering this week still processing the emotional intensity <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">of the recent eclipse</a>, and you may feel more aware than usual of your deeper needs and boundaries. The first full week of Pisces Season activates your intimacy, healing, and shared resources zone, pulling your focus beneath the surface. This energy asks you to slow down and get honest about emotional exchanges, financial entanglements, or situations where you’ve been giving more power away than you realized.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a social checkpoint. A conversation with friends, a group dynamic, or a long-term goal may require adjustment. If plans shift or people show you new sides of themselves, stay flexible. Gemini energy here is about recalibrating your network so it reflects where you’re actually headed.</p>



<p>As February winds down, the tone turns even more reflective. On February 26th, Mercury starts its retrograde in Pisces for the next three weeks. You may need to revisit agreements around money, boundaries, or expectations in close relationships. Old feelings could resurface, or past connections may reappear for closure. This isn’t the time to make major financial commitments or merge resources impulsively. Instead, think of this period as emotional and energetic bookkeeping. The more honest you are now about what you share, what you owe, and what you need, the stronger your foundation will be moving forward.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Virgo, this week is all about relationships, reflections, and recalibrating how you show up with others. The first full week <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">of Pisces Season</a> activates your partnership realm, putting the spotlight on one-on-one dynamics in love, business, and close collaborations. You may feel more emotionally attuned to others’ needs, but also more aware of where the balance feels off.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a reality check around your career or public direction. A professional conversation, decision, or expectation could create temporary pressure that spills into your personal life. Gemini energy asks you to stay adaptable and communicate clearly rather than assuming you have to carry everything alone.</p>



<p>Things get more personal on February 26th, when your ruling planet Mercury shifts retrograde in Pisces for the next three weeks. Because Mercury governs you, you’ll feel this shift more strongly than most. Miscommunications, mixed signals, or unresolved dynamics with partners may surface, not to create chaos, but to be addressed honestly. This isn’t the best time to rush into new relationship commitments, sign major contracts, or make emotional ultimatums. Instead, think of this as a relationship review period: old conversations may resurface, past partners could reappear, or you may simply see a current dynamic more clearly. The more patient and transparent you are now, the stronger and more balanced your connections will become.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Libra, you may still be feeling the emotional weight of last week’s Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries, which activated your partnership realm in a major way. Big realizations about commitment, boundaries, or the reality of certain relationships are still settling in. This week isn’t about making dramatic moves, it’s about integrating what you’ve learned and giving yourself space to process how your relationship patterns are evolving.</p>



<p>The first <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">full week of Pisces Season</a> shifts your attention toward your daily life, work rhythms, and overall well-being. This is a softer, more intuitive period for adjusting your schedule so it actually supports your energy. Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini may bring a mental or logistical speed bump around travel plans, learning, or a long-term goal. Stay flexible and open to changing your approach rather than pushing for immediate clarity.</p>



<p>As February winds down, Mercury goes retrograde in Pisces on February 26th for the next three weeks. Expect shifts in your schedule, workplace miscommunications, or a need to revisit health habits and boundaries around how much you’re taking on. This is less about being perfectly productive and more about creating systems that are sustainable. Small adjustments now will make a big difference once Mercury moves forward again.</p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, after the emotional shakeup of last week’s Aquarius solar eclipse, this first full week <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">of Pisces Season</a> feels like a welcome exhale. That eclipse squared Uranus in your partnership realm, bringing unexpected shifts or truths in relationships that may have felt destabilizing in the moment, but ultimately freeing. Now, Pisces energy helps you soften. This is your zone of romance, creativity, joy, and inner child healing, inviting you to date yourself, say yes to what feels fun again, and allow love to flow both ways. You may notice your mood lifting, your creativity returning, and your desire for play coming back online. Let this be a lighter week… you’ve earned it.</p>



<p>On February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a practical checkpoint around shared finances, debts, or long-term wealth planning. This could surface as a small speed bump or reality check, but Gemini energy keeps the tone lighter than usual. Instead of spiraling, approach your situation with curiosity and even a little humor. This is a good time to explore multiple income streams or rethink how you’re managing resources, just be mindful not to overcommit or take on more than you can realistically handle.</p>



<p>As February wraps up, Mercury begins its retrograde in Pisces on February 26th, also in your romance and creativity zone. Over the next three weeks, nostalgia may hit hard. Old flames, familiar dynamics, or rose-colored memories could resurface, making the past look sweeter than it actually was. Stay grounded. This retrograde is less about rekindling old patterns and more about healing them. Use this time for rest, creative reflection, and reconnecting with the version of you that feels playful, expressive, and emotionally safe.</p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, the first full <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">week of Pisces Season</a> pulls your focus inward toward home, family, and your emotional foundation. After the intensity and movement of the past few weeks, this energy asks you to slow down and tend to your inner world. You may feel the urge to nest, rest, or spend more time with the people and spaces that make you feel safe. Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a relationship checkpoint. A conversation, decision, or difference in perspective could surface with a partner or close collaborator. Gemini energy here isn’t about conflict, it’s about communication. Stay curious, ask questions, and avoid jumping to conclusions.</p>



<p>As February winds down, Mercury shifts retrograde in Pisces on February 26th for the next three weeks. Plans around living situations, family matters, or domestic routines may shift, or old memories and feelings could resurface. This isn’t the time to rush major moves or make permanent decisions about your living environment unless the process began earlier. Instead, use this period to reorganize your space, revisit emotional boundaries, and create a home life that actually supports your energy. Slowing down now will give you the stability you’ll need for the momentum ahead.</p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the first full <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">week of Pisces Season</a> shifts your focus toward communication, learning, and the conversations shaping your day-to-day life. You may feel more reflective than usual, noticing how your words, thoughts, and mental habits are affecting your energy. This is a softer, more intuitive time for writing, brainstorming, or having heart-centered conversations.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a practical checkpoint around your work routines, responsibilities, or health habits. A small scheduling issue, workload adjustment, or energy dip could surface. Gemini energy asks you to stay flexible and tweak your systems rather than pushing yourself harder.</p>



<p>As February wraps up, Mercury begins its retrograde in Pisces for the next three weeks. Expect delays, crossed wires, or the need to revisit conversations, paperwork, or short-term plans. This isn’t the best time to rush contracts, announcements, or major decisions unless they’ve been in motion already. Instead, use this period to edit, review, and clarify. Slowing down your pace and double-checking details now will save you time and stress once Mercury moves forward again.</p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, after such a personal and intense stretch, the first full <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">week of Pisces Season</a> shifts your focus toward grounding and rebuilding your sense of stability. This energy activates your money, self-worth, and values zone, encouraging you to slow down and get clear about what actually feels sustainable. You may find yourself reassessing where your time and energy are going and whether the return feels aligned.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a creative or emotional checkpoint. Something related to dating, a passion project, or how you’re expressing yourself may need a small adjustment. Gemini energy asks you to stay playful and flexible rather than taking the moment too seriously.</p>



<p>As February comes to a close, Mercury begins its retrograde in Pisces in your financial and self-esteem sector for the next three weeks. Payments, budgeting plans, or income conversations may shift or require review. This isn’t the time for major financial risks or impulsive purchases unless they were already planned. Instead, use this period to reassess your spending, renegotiate your value, and reconnect with what actually makes you feel secure. Slow and intentional moves now will help you build a stronger foundation moving forward.</p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, this first full week <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">of your solar return season</a> puts you back at the center of your own story. After the intensity and collective shifts of the past few weeks, the energy now asks you to move at your pace, not the world’s. You may feel more sensitive, intuitive, and aware of what your body and emotions actually need.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a checkpoint around home, family, or your emotional foundation. A conversation, scheduling shift, or small tension in your living environment may require flexibility. Gemini energy here is a reminder to stay adaptable and communicate rather than internalize everything.</p>



<p>Things turn even more introspective on February 26th, when Mercury begins its three-week retrograde in your sign. Since this is happening in your identity and personal expression zone, you may feel more reflective, nostalgic, or uncertain about how you want to show up. Old versions of yourself, past decisions, or unfinished emotional stories could resurface. This isn’t the time to rush major reinventions or make bold personal announcements. Instead, treat this as a personal reset. Journal, rest, revisit your intentions, and let clarity come back to you naturally. The more gentle and honest you are with yourself now, the more aligned your next chapter will feel.</p>

<p><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/10/11938298/bridgerton-season-4-details-cast-love-story-characters"">Bridgerton’s</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/10/11938298/bridgerton-season-4-details-cast-love-story-characters""> Yerin Ha</a> is currently <em>everywhere</em>. While we have been fans of the Korean-Australian actor since <em>Halo</em> and <em>Bad Behaviour</em>, her breakout role in <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/10/11938163/bridgerton-season-4-details-cast-love-story-characters"">Bridgerton</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/10/11938163/bridgerton-season-4-details-cast-love-story-characters""> Season 4</a> as Sophie Baek has put her on the map worldwide. As the first <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2022/03/10896653/asian-australian-women-online-communities"">East Asian</a> to lead the Regency romance drama, she continues to break boundaries and offer representation for those less seen on screen.</p>



<p>As a rising star, Ha has also been hand-picked by SAG-AFTRA to become the Ambassador for <a href=""https://www.actorawards.org/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Actor Awards</a>, which will air live on March 2. The star will be sharing behind-the-scenes content and participating in multiple pre-show events.</p>



<p>“Being named The Actor Awards Ambassador is such an honor because this ceremony is about actors celebrating actors,” Ha said. “There is something uniquely powerful about being recognised within your own community. As someone who cares so deeply about the craft and about collaboration, it means so much to represent the next generation of actors and be part of an event that uplifts storytelling.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>There is something uniquely powerful about being recognised within your own community.</p><cite>Yerin Ha</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Ha follows in the footsteps of previous SAG-AFTRA Ambassadors such as Sofia Carson, Haley Lu Richardson, Antonia Gentry and Alexandra Daddario.</p>



<p>The <em>Bridgerton </em>star was most recently seen at Gold House’s Lunar New Year party, where <a href=""https://people.com/bridgerton-yerin-ha-says-former-leads-simone-ashley-and-nicola-coughlan-have-been-lovely-and-supportive-exclusive-11681027"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">she opened up to </a><em><a href=""https://people.com/bridgerton-yerin-ha-says-former-leads-simone-ashley-and-nicola-coughlan-have-been-lovely-and-supportive-exclusive-11681027"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">People</a></em> about East-Asian representation on screen. “It’s been really, really amazing and beautiful. I mean, I’ve been really caught up with the [<em>Bridgerton</em>] press tour, so I don’t think I’ve been too [online], Ha said. “It has been really positive and I just feel so proud that I get to be the face of that and keep advocating for change, and knowing that we deserve these roles and spaces.”</p>



<p><em>Bridgerton</em> Season 4 Part 2 will be released on February 26, and will see Ha’s Sophie (hopefully) win Benedict’s heart and become a true leading lady. In a time where the world can seem overwhelming, it’s lovely to be able to celebrate Ha and her successes.</p>

<p>My feed has been completely taken over by fans lamenting that they haven’t been able to secure <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/05/9781230/hilary-duff-kids-luca-banks-mom-advice-media"">Hilary Duff</a> tickets for <a href=""https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a70327671/how-to-buy-hilary-duff-the-lucky-me-tour-tickets/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Lucky Me Tour</a>. From people sliding into the pop star’s DMs to beg her to add more dates, to countless memes and TikToks from those who missed out, it’s clear that <a href=""https://lifestyle.si.com/news/hilary-duff-pens-love-letter-to-fans-following-new-album-release"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hilary Duff fever</a> has landed. During the first Mastercard pre-sale in Australia where I live, there were over 50,000 fans in the queue. Aside from the fact that Duff hasn’t toured here for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/ipod-noughties-tech-nostalgia"">18 years</a>, the demand could tie into this interesting trend of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/gen-z-nostalgia-millennial-experience"">pop culture selling nostalgia</a> — a sure-fire way to tap into already established audiences. </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/apr/28/that-yearning-feeling-why-we-need-nostalgia"">According to psychologists</a>, nostalgia is a powerful tool. It has the ability to increase self-esteem, help people form social bonds, soothe anxiety, boredom and stress, as well as being positive for your mental health. One fan tells me a <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15562273/Hilary-Duff-tour-fans-engaged-las-vegas.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">connection with Hilary Duff</a> transports her back to when times felt safer and easier. “They weren’t lying when they said ‘don’t grow up’. I was really lucky growing up, I had a beautiful childhood, with a big family, everything was simple back then and the world felt beautiful and full of colour,” fan Sakara Bell says. “I’ll never forget the Christmas when I unwrapped her album <em>Most Wanted</em>. I played <em>Beat Of My Heart </em>on repeat for months and never got tired of it.”</p>



<p>Anita Tran, who was lucky enough to purchase tickets, says nostalgia is “powerful” right now. “It transports me back to when my biggest worry was whether I’d make it back home in time to watch my favourite Disney Channel shows. A time where my first crush was <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7530306456667622687"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chad Michael Murray</a> in <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/01/10259591/one-tree-hill-james-lafferty-now-engaged-career"">One Tree Hill</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/01/10259591/one-tree-hill-james-lafferty-now-engaged-career""> </a>or I first understood what love meant watching <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2021/09/10678647/best-2000s-tv-shows-teens"">Dawson’s Creek</a></em>. It’s sweet, it’s innocent, and it’s just safe,” Tran adds. “Hilary is my childhood. <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"">She takes me back to my youth, where a cartoon <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lizzie-mcguire-hair-makeup"">Lizzie McGuire</a> </em>narrated my exact teenage thoughts, and <em>Metamorphosis </em>was the album my besties and I blasted on the way home from school</span>.” Other fans echoed the same sentiment, with one wanting to “heal her inner teen”, and another says Duff “genuinely influenced her personality as a child”. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Being able to experience something that is your childhood, is everything and more.</p><cite>Sakara Bell, Hilary Duff Fan</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Duff’s triumphant return to pop music is not only a reclaiming of her story, and finally being able to write the music <em>she always wanted to write</em>, but it ties into a larger theme of how we’re seeing the world. The <a href=""https://dictionary.apa.org/nostalgia"">definition of nostalgia</a> is wanting to return to a time of life where things seemed better than the present, and with the current political climate, consumers are more desperate for nostalgia than ever. With an ongoing <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/palestine-mothers-children-gaza-solidarity"">genocide in Gaza</a>, <a href=""https://psychology.org.au/insights/the-australian-women-dreading-change-in-trump%E2%80%99s-am"">Trump rolling back women’s rights</a>, and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2026/02/11959006/celebrity-political-statements-grammys-super-bowl"">issues of ICE in the USA</a>, it seems almost impossible to go through life without being faced with a new horrific truth. Shared nostalgia gives us an escape, where we can come together and bond as a community. </p>



<p>It’s no surprise that brands have commodified nostalgia. If you were wondering why there have been endless amounts of reboots (did we <em>really</em> need <em>Zoey 102</em>?), and beloved childhood toys like <em>Barbie</em> getting the big-screen treatment, there’s a reason. <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/41/3/713/2907535"">Research shows</a> that nostalgia can “decrease people’s desire for money”. People are more willing to open their wallets and pay more for products. <em><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/4JlqOqhImVEFmH4ue7GbVH"">Culture Club</a> </em>co-host and writer Jasmine Wallis agrees, believing that while she loves nostalgia, a big part of it is capitalism. “Millenials and older Gen Z’s (like Hilary’s fans) are entering adulthood in a really tough economy. So, while having kids and buying a house feels like a huge struggle and sacrifice, attending concerts like Hilary’s can offer a sense of joy for just $200,” Wallis says. “It takes us back to childhood whilst also offering a reprieve from adulthood. Executives and corporations know this and so are playing into it.” Duff fan Sakara Bell is aware of this marketing tactic, but it doesn’t turn her off at all. “I don’t really care. As cringy as it is, you only live once, and I’m a big believer in money comes and goes,” Bell says. “Being able to experience something that is your childhood, is everything and more.” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>It takes us back to childhood whilst also offering a reprieve from adulthood. Executives and corporations know this and so are playing into it.</p><cite>Jasmine Wallis, co-host and writer of culture club</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Nostalgia isn’t even exclusive to your own childhood, either. <a href=""https://theharrispoll.com/briefs/millennials-lead-american-optimism-for-the-future/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Even Gen Z are tapping into nostalgia</a> for the 1990s, including those who weren’t alive at the time. The pre-digital era is coveted by those who believe we’re spending too long doomscrolling. According to a study in the US, two-thirds of Gen Z adults wished to return to a world before we were all “plugged in”. </p>



<p>Perhaps that’s why Hilary Duff has completely taken over in Australia. It’s about more than just her hits (but she has great bops, to be fair), and more about society and how we yearn for a simpler, kinder time in life. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960290.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>When I say I’ve watched the rise and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/body-inclusivity-in-fashion-2025"">fall of size inclusion</a> at <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/search?q=nyfw"">New York Fashion Week</a>, I really mean it. <br /><br />I was at the runway of <em>the</em> first plus-size designer on the official NYFW calendar (Eden Miller’s Cabiria, showing at Mercedes Benz Fashion Week back in 2013). A year later, I was there when <a href=""https://www.elle.com/fashion/a45139956/plus-size-new-york-fashion-week/"">Chromat opened their SS15 show with plus model Denise Bidot</a> — and I made a very un-fashion-week-like exclamation of excitement when I saw her step onto the runway. I saw Christian Siriano go from a straight size designer to a plus fashion collab with Lane Bryant, to dressing plus celebrities for the red carpet, to becoming one of the designers known for dressing <em>every</em> body once he normalized <a href=""https://www.glamour.com/story/5-plus-size-models-just-walked-in-christian-sirianos-fashion-show"">including multiple plus models on the runway in 2016</a>.<br /><br />For a glorious while, it felt like progress was inevitable and the number of plus models walking NYFW would just keep going up… and then the pandemic hit. And then <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/body-positivity-movement-fat-black-women-weight-loss"">the rise of Ozempic</a> for weight loss hit. And suddenly, progress hadn’t just ground to a halt — we were going backwards. <br /><br />As someone who has been <a href=""https://www.elle.com/elleextra/events/a46688773/fashioning-a-more-size-inclusive-nyfw-panel-discussion/"">pushing for size inclusion in fashion</a> for over a decade, it is beyond disheartening to see the tiny bit of hard-fought progress we made being pushed back so rapidly. I’ve loved fashion since I was a little kid (I was the 5 year-old seeking out copies of <em>Vogue</em> and <em>Elle</em> at the local library), and I still get a thrill from covering NYFW even after a decade plus of doing so. But sometimes I look at the CFDA calendar before a season starts and feel my anxiety rising, because I just know there probably will be little to no size diversity to come. <br /><br />That bad-gut feeling was sadly correct this season. The official numbers aren’t in yet, but this might have been one of the least size diverse New York Fashion Weeks in recent history — and that bar is <em>low</em>.<br /><br />Now, some of this season’s dip can be attributed to certain brands sitting the season out. Last season, I saw the bulk of visibly plus size representation at plus-specific shows like<a href=""https://www.reneecafaroatelier.com/""> Renee Cafaro Atelier</a> and plus fashion label <a href=""https://www.eloquii.com/"">Eloquii</a>’s NYFW debut. Size inclusive designers like <a href=""https://rachelantonoff.com/"">Rachel Antonoff</a> and Kimberly Gordon of <a href=""https://selkiecollection.com/"">Selkie</a> can always be counted on for truly diverse runways too, but neither showed this season. <a href=""https://www.alexisbittar.com/"">Alexis Bittar</a> is another designer that I always find casts without discriminating against larger bodies (last season’s pageant-themed presentation was filled with dolls of every size), but this year’s visceral, violent, and excellent vignette just included one model (and one victim), so size diversity wasn’t applicable this time around. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p><strong>But all that just highlights the fact that it shouldn’t be on a handful of designers to carry all of the representation at Fashion Week. Because when they change their format or skip a season, the absence is keenly felt. </strong></p><cite>Sarah Chiwaya</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>These feelings are <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/fashion/skinny-models-ozempic-glp1.html"">supported by the data</a>: We’ve not yet seen the numbers from this season, but last season the representation was insignificant, with less than 1% plus models on the runway, and 97.1% of models sizes 0-4. Given that the average U.S. size is closer to a 16/18 (and <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm"">recent CDC data</a> shows that that size is holding true even after years of aggressive marketing of GLP-1s for weight loss), that is nothing short of abysmal. <br /><br />To be clear, we’ve never approached anything even CLOSE to equitable runway representation (which would mean at least 67% curve models). Indeed, we’ve barely even cracked 5% — and that’s with the most generous calculations. Tokenization, which is not real representation, has often been the norm over the last decade, but there’s nothing like seeing <em>zero</em> curves on the runway to put the absence of even that little bit of size diversity into sharp relief. <br /><br />I wasn’t alone in feeling it, either. Bella Gerard, a fashion editor and author of <a href=""https://bellagerard.substack.com/"">Substack’s B List</a>, also noted the blatant regression: “Above all else, the lack of body diversity on the runway this season just feels so…disappointing,” she noted. “It’s not breaking news that attempts at inclusivity are often performative in the fashion sphere, but this season really proved a ‘one step forward, three steps back’ reality. Not only was there next to no curve representation, but the straight size models looked even thinner than in recent years, calling back to an era of thinspo I thought we’d collectively renounced and evolved past.” </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960212.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960213.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Fortunately, there were some bright points this season too, with top designers whose visions of fashion were not constrained to just one type of girl. On the first day of shows, <a href=""https://collinastrada.com/"">Collina Strada</a> showed a deliciously darkly romantic-yet-eclectic collection, replete with high <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/09/11778397/beetlejuice-beetlejuice-fashion-costumes"">Victorian lace collars</a>, blurred prints, volume play, and body baring dropped-waist silk dresses that looked equally hot on straight and plus size models. Later that evening, <a href=""https://www.jane-wade.com/"">Jane Wade</a>’s show — titled “The Summit” — was an innovative fashion expedition, with conifers on the runway, tents on dresses (and <em>as</em> dresses), and survival-ready fabrications merged with Wade’s signature suiting and elevated officewear. (The story of a corporate woman dreaming of an escape to nature is crucially not one limited by size.)<br /><br />And at New York Men’s Day, <a href=""https://www.a-potts.com/"">A.Potts</a> showed a distinctive style of oversized, genderless clothing on a cast that included both age diversity and an even more underrepresented category: Male plus models. Designer Aaron Potts is no stranger to size diverse casting, either: Prior seasons have included plus models, and I — a size 20 — was actually one of the models for the launch of his new diffusion label Werkshop by A.Potts (which was also featured in his NYMD presentation). <br /><br />I allowed myself a little hope after that good first day, but as the week went on and I saw more shows with <em>zero</em> curve models than not, the lack of size inclusion just felt more and more pronounced. Industry friends who knew I was reporting on size inclusion this season would occasionally text me curve model sightings. “Paloma on the runway at Proenza.” “One curve model at Gabe Gordon.” “I think two? at Eckhaus Latta.” Every message was appreciated, but the underlying implication that we needed to be eagle-eyed to spot even a smidgeon of size inclusion was a downer. <br /><br />Then there were the false positives, driven by the emerging trend of adding mass to thin bodies with clothing. I saw countless peplums, panniers, and padded pieces throughout the week, and as I was desperately searching for a hint of curve and trying to parse a tall size 8 curve model from her size 4 contemporary, I occasionally got excited only to realize that was just a straight size model with fabric curves added on. It felt like I was playing an unwitting (and unwelcome) game of “curve model or just a structured hip?” When there’s so little visual difference between straight and curve models — who do not typically wear <em>actual</em> plus sizes, paradoxically — the facade of inclusion shatters even more.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960287.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>Shows with organic diversity, like <a href=""https://kimshui.net/"">Kim Shui</a>’s richly textured, color-forward FW26 show, were some of the bright points of the season, but were sadly the exceptions, not the rule. Age diversity did seem to be on the uptick, too — with gorgeous older models in shows including <a href=""https://www.carolinaherrera.com/us/en/"">Carolina Herrera</a>, <a href=""https://diotima.world/"">Diotima</a>, and the relaunch of <a href=""https://dereklam.com/"">Derek Lam</a> with new creative director Robert Rodriguez at the helm.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p><strong>Yet as I saw runway after runway composed exclusively of the thinnest models, the scattered tips I was getting about curve models on the runway started to feel like rare sightings of an endangered species.</strong> </p><cite>Sarah Chiwaya</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>As someone with 25 seasons of NYFW under my belt and who has dedicated my career to the push for more and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wray-closing-plus-size-community-impact"">better for plus size women</a>, I am always wary when there’s a category that seems like the chosen diversity <em>du jour. </em>True representation should be across the board and not a passing trend, with an ongoing emphasis on making sure underrepresented groups can see themselves in fashion. I’ve obviously clocked this, but other fashion industry vets have noted it as well. <br /><br />In <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/fashion/skinny-models-ozempic-glp1.html"">a recent piece for the <em>New York Times</em></a>, top fashion critic Vanessa Friedman noted that the recent shift extends well beyond the catwalk: “The gravitational pull is toward an ever-shrinking human form, especially on the runway,” she wrote. “It’s too bad. Not because skinniness is bad, but because it should not be the only option. People still come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. Seeing the reality of life reflected on the runways, which have become a form of entertainment for everyone, is actually more appealing than seeing life reduced to one size that cannot fit all.<br /><br />Designers who really understand that appeal also know that it’s good for their bottom line. Committing to size inclusivity isn’t just the ethical thing to do — it’s good business sense, too. Take Christian Siriano, who <a href=""https://www.elle.com/fashion/celebrity-style/a21529009/christian-siriano-tripled-his-business-by-adding-plus-sizes/"">extolled the fiscal virtues of size inclusion back in 2018</a>, saying: “Adding plus sizes to my line tripled my business. Why wouldn’t you do that?!” <br /><br />This season, when asked about diversity in casting, he echoed that sentiment, exclaiming that it was “so important!” Last week, the designer punctuated this belief visually by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DU659FZiSdq/"">sending the same silhouette down the runway on two different body types</a>. “I love how you can see they look amazing in the same dress, in the same look,” he told me backstage. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960215.jpg?width=854&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=427%3A512"" /></figure></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960216.jpg?width=854&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=427%3A512"" /></figure></div>



<p>When designers approach representation as part of their brand identity, it effortlessly translates to the audience. Both legendary R&amp;B singer Monica and <em>the </em>Whoopi Goldberg independently praised Siriano’s commitment to making fashion for all backstage. “It was absolute elegance, and it was for every size, shape, color and creed, so many different types of women — and men! — in the show,” Monica noted. “Gives you all sorts of inspiration!” Goldberg summed it up even more succinctly: “Christian’s work just always inspires me and makes me so happy, because we can all wear it.”<br /><br />That type of organic inclusion was also evident in <a href=""https://chukscollins.com/"">Chuks Collins</a>’s striking presentation, which ranged from lush topstitched knits to sharp suits to stunning structured ballgowns, all shown on a range of sizes and body types. (Collins was heavily influenced by how scarification, purposeful, ritual, and otherwise, can play into the way we present ourselves to the world.)<br /><br />“I grew up seeing people that look like you, people that look like me,” Collins said. “My mom is not a size 2. My grandmother, who taught me to sew, she’s not a size 10. About 40 to 50% of my clients are plus size people. So I am not going to lie to myself and say ‘oh, my demographic, my ideal demographic is a size 2 to 4.’”<br /><br />For Collins, who started the brand in 2006, building a collection for customers of all sizes is both a labor of love and a practical financial matter — after all, he’s building a label he wants to last. “I have to create clothes that people see themselves in, that they want to wear. With that, I’m becoming a successful business,” he noted. “I also just love dressing people with curves, because that’s what I started doing, that’s how I started my career. So I’m not going to — because of what, industry standards? — I’m not going to include that? And I love women. I love beautiful women with curves. I tell the stories of how I feel, and my work is a representation of myself.” <br /><br />In the end, an outsized portion of the size diversity this season came from emerging designers and those making their CFDA debuts, such as Menyelek Rose of the eponymous label <a href=""https://www.menyelek.online/"">Menyelek</a>. Designer <a href=""https://www.andrewcurwen.com/home"">Andrew Curwen</a>, meanwhile, showed a sexy, directional, and haunting (complimentary!) collection. “Nocturnal Conditions” looked stunning on every figure, and the diverse cast (by F10 Casting agency) felt simultaneously natural and intentional. <br /><br />Camryn Mcclain of <a href=""https://reneenyc.com/"">RENÉE NYC</a> also cited body diversity as integral to her inspiration: “For casting this season, we focused on different characters of everyday people of various shapes and sizes that reflect what I see in the city,” Mcclain said. That thoughtfulness complemented a presentation of some of the most interesting knitwear I’ve seen lately, with bold braiding and fringe details rendered in rich jewel tones and gilded neutrals. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960219.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960220.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>“I want my collection to inspire and be inclusive for everyone,” said <a href=""https://veejayfloresca.com/"">Veejay Floresca</a>, another designer on the CFDA calendar for the first time. “I worked with my team to cast models across sizes, races, ages, and gender identities so that everyone can see themselves in the collection I created. It is so important to me that everyone feels beautiful and can express themselves freely and I hope my collection can bring this to all of my customers.” <br /><br />The casting fully reflected that, with a stunning range of bodies (including <em>Project Runway</em> star plus model Liris Crosse) all looking occasion-ready in sumptuous gowns and suiting. Floresca’s <em>Project Runway</em> mentor Christian Siriano was also in attendance, and it felt both poetic and prophetic that Floresca is also adding to the legacy of embracing true runway diversity. <br /><br />As New York Fashion Week wrapped, social media was only beginning to set itself ablaze with <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DU6qBxcEmoA/?img_index=1"">reactions to the new Netflix documentary centered on <em>America’s Next Top Model</em></a>, particularly  the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/harmful-beauty-standards-artificial-intelligence"">impossible beauty standards</a> that persisted then and seem intent on making a vicious comeback today. While reactions to the show — and the harmful standards that were upheld in the era of <em>ANTM — </em>are rightfully horrified, it’s worth looking at the present in the same lens.<br /><br />Fashion is meant to be forward-looking, creative, and progressive, but all too often falls into the “that’s just the way things are” default.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p><strong>Designers letting themselves off the diversity hook now, thinking the current wave of regressive and exclusionary ideals will be an excuse, will inevitably find themselves on the wrong side of history. </strong></p><cite>Sarah Chiwaya</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>For now, the bright spots and the designers that see fashion for all will keep me going. As Curwen said after his show: “Those who are told ‘no’ the most in the industry are the ones we pay the most attention to.” In doing so, Curwen and designers like him set themselves apart from the crowded field of brands all targeting the least populous market (aka straight sizes). Here’s hoping the industry gets on board with this more expansive view of who belongs in fashion, and other designers see the opportunity that true inclusion presents, for both business and the human obligation. </p>

<p>As a fashion writer, dressing up for New York Fashion Week is both exhilarating and daunting to me (especially during the February shows when a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-jackets-for-women"">winter coat</a> can make or break your outfit). Do I opt for an all-black, NY journalist uniform? Do I try to go all out like one of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-street-style"">Getty-photographed fashion darlings</a>? Or do I dress on-theme for specific shows? Decisions, decisions!<br /><br />At this point, I’ve grown accustomed to the chaos and long days of NYFW, so I like to plan my outfits well ahead of time. When I was planning out this season’s looks for seven straight days, I predominately considered pieces that I’d feel most comfortable in — because when I left my BK home, I certainly wasn’t going back to do a not-so-quick change in the middle of my packed schedule.<br /><br />Leaning on the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-2026-fashion-beauty-lookbook"">Refinery29’s Winter 2026 Lookbook</a> for some outfit inspiration, I decided that — with what I already had in my closet and what brands graciously leant to me for the week — I’d put my own twist on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-fashion-beauty-trends-forecast-2025-2026"">“The Demuralist” look</a> (with hints of The Weather-Maxxer and The Holiday Host aesthetics) for Day 2 of NYFW.<br /><br />In this reimagined Roaring Twenties look: “The all-black uniform gets a festive lift here with sequins and quietly elegant accessories.” While I’m not the most sparkly person, I took bits and pieces from this modern flapper aesthetic and styled a glam look that could take me from day to night, across the city, and confidently into five designers’ runway shows.<br /><br />Ahead, see how I interpreted R29’s stylist-vetted Demuralist trend, the exact pieces I wore (including an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-trends"">on-trend hat moment</a>), and outfit inspo to get you through the rest of the frigid winter in style. </p>

<p>Some themes of “The Demuralist” include dark palettes, luxe details, and rich textures. “We wanted to lean into this idea of the ‘20s and that being a reference point for celebration,” stylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/christinenicholson__/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Christine Nicholson</a> told me behind the scenes of the R29 photoshoot. “We kept the idea of craftsmanship as it relates to things like beading, but made it feel new and fresh.” <br /><br />Taking style cues (but not hard and fast rules) from the lookbook, I opted for my black <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/madewell-alexa-chung-collaboration-2024"">Madewell x Alexa Chung</a> oversized corduroy blazer, rather than a statement dress. I just love the thick fabric and unexpected bright-white buttons. I doubled down on the textures of this look by wearing a white ribbed sweater with fluffy wrist cuffs (that perfectly peeked out from my blazer sleeves) from <a href=""https://www.cupshe.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cupshe</a>. And while the R29 model was styled in funky culottes under her <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/spring-dress-trends-2025"">drop-waist dress</a>, I chose my unassumingly stretchy and comfy trousers from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-lululemon-gifts"">Lululemon</a> that I knew would keep my legs warm.<br /><br />With my base layers offering a more masculine silhouette, it then came time to jazz up the look with feminine flapper energy through accessorizing. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959893.jpeg?width=854&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=427%3A512"" /></figure></div>

<p>The Demuralist look consists of long sequined gloves (Note: opera gloves were everywhere during NYFW!), fuzzy Mary Jane heels, and, of course, a spectacular headpiece. And to my delight, I knew just the pieces that would give a similar festive and vintage flair, that felt wearable; not just editorial. <br /><br />I excitedly whipped out the funky magenta fur mittens I had purchased as a tween. (While they at one point revolted me, they’re of course back in style and add a touch of whimsy to every winter outfit.) I also slipped on my burgundy <a href=""https://www.vivaia.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Vivaia</a> knit waterproof boots, which were the perfect touch of color and texture (and sensible for the snowy streets).<br /><br />The cherry on top of this ’20s-esque look came about while rummaging through <a href=""https://tjmaxx.tjx.com/store/index.jsp"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">TJ Maxx</a> (my favorite pastime). I stumbled on a burgundy faux fur trapper-like hat that felt like it was from a past era, and knew I wanted to wear it during NYFW.<br /><br />The final touch (that I picked up just one day before NYFW) was an incredible faux fur scarf-shawl-hybrid from <a href=""https://misscircle.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miss Circle</a>. It was so luxe and dramatic, and helped me channel some flapper energy. (It also brought me the biggest compliments from industry peers throughout the day!)</p>

<p>While translating a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-2026-fashion-beauty-lookbook"">bold editorial photoshoot fashion look</a> into a wearable IRL look was at first daunting, the final outcome wound up being one of my favorite NYFW outfits to date.<br /><br />Taking notes from the R29 Lookbook helped inspire an outfit I may have never put together otherwise. In the end, my interpretation had me feeling festive, comfortable, confident, and most importantly, like myself. And I can say with confidence that you <em>have </em>to try it for yourself too.</p>

<p>As a beauty editor of ten years, I’ve been a guest at a fair share of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dyson-hairstyling-tools-worth-it-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">hair tool</a> launch events, from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-flexfusion-styler-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">blow-out brushes</a> that are like having your own personal hairstylist, to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mermade-hair-curling-iron-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">curling irons</a> that use clever mechanisms to draw your hair in and form a perfect tousle. But none have drawn as many collective “Oohs” and “Ahhs” from my editor peers as <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fshark-silkipro-straight-wet-to-dry-straightener-rapid-blow-dryer-plum-satin%2FHT400PU.html%3Fdwvar_HT400PU_color%3DA875B3"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shark’s new SilkiPro</a>. </p>



<p>I know what you’re thinking: <em>another hair tool?</em> And you’d have a fair point. In recent years, Shark has unveiled the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fbuild-your-own-shark-glam-hot-tool-air-styling-drying-system%2FHD6000PKSN.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glam AirStyling System</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fshark-glossi-2-in-1-hot-tool-and-air-glosser-juniper%2FHT302TL.html%3Fdwvar_HT302TL_color%3D429195"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glossi Hot Tool</a>, and the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fbuild-your-own-shark-flexstyle-air-styling-drying-system-stone%2FHD400SN.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">FlexStyle Drying and Styling System</a> (a personal favorite of mine). But the SilkiPro Straight is different. No, really — it straightened my thick, wavy hair in ten minutes flat when it usually takes 30. But more on that later.  </p>



<h2>What is Shark’s SilkiPro Straight and what are the benefits? </h2>



<p><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fshark-silkipro-straight-wet-to-dry-straightener-rapid-blow-dryer-plum-satin%2FHT400PU.html%3Fdwvar_HT400PU_color%3DA875B3"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shark’s SilkiPro</a> is a wet-to-dry straightener and blowdryer in one. Imagine your current flat iron had discreet vents inside that released warm air for a smoother finish with every pass, and you’ve got the idea.  </p>



<p>At the bottom of the tool, there’s a slide-up button that lets you select a mode for wet or damp hair, which emits heated airflow — with the intensity controlled via a separate button. There’s another mode for dry hair, which relies solely on the ceramic straightening plates, without additional airflow. In other words, it combines everything you love about a flat iron — quick, high-shine results — with the benefits of a blowdry brush like less frizz and a smoother finish.  </p>



<p>Perhaps the most brilliant feature is the built-in blowdryer. You can lock the tool closed, and the airflow comes out from the sides, letting you rough-dry your hair before styling. </p>

<h2>What makes Shark’s SilkiPro Straight special? </h2>



<p>At Shark’s launch event, I was lucky enough to see the tool in action on two models — one with very thick, curly hair and another with fine, wavy hair. LA-based hairstylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jaybirmingham_/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jay Birmingham</a> was on hand to demonstrate, and I was mesmerized by how quickly it slid through the first model’s curls, leaving a sleek handful of hair in just a couple of passes.  </p>



<p>According to Birmingham, this is largely thanks to the smart, inconspicuous slots inside the tool, which accommodate combs in three different sizes — all included with the tool. Birmingham explained that if you usually “chase” your straightener with a comb or brush to achieve a smooth, sleek finish, there’s no need anymore — it’s essentially built in. The larger wide-tooth comb is especially brilliant for thick, curly, and coily hair.  </p>



<p>On the model with finer, straighter hair, Birmingham demonstrated how to create flat-iron waves by clamping the straightener on the hair and twisting it downward. When he released, it produced the most effortless tousled look. </p>

<h2>What’s the difference between Shark’s SilkiPro Straight and the Dyson AirStrait? </h2>



<p>Now, you’re probably wondering how the SilkiPro compares to Dyson’s AirStrait. While they look similar at first glance, they’re actually quite different. The AirStrait doesn’t have ceramic hot plates, whereas the SilkiPro does. This means you can use it without airflow on dry hair to straighten, create waves, or touch up your style. If you ask me, it’s also lighter and perhaps quieter — and unlike the Dyson, it comes with those aforementioned slide-in combs.  </p>



<p>Dyson’s hallmark is that its tools don’t cause heat damage, so you might assume the ceramic plates on the SilkiPro would fry your hair like a traditional straightener. Fortunately, the SilkiPro has heat sensors that adjust the temperature automatically when it gets too hot, lending silky results without split ends. Of course, repeatedly going over a section or holding the plates down for too long can still cause damage, but because it works so quickly, one or two slow passes is usually enough. (And I always recommend heat protection.) </p>



<p>In terms of results, Dyson’s tool leaves hair looking more naturally straight and swishy, while Shark’s makes mine look sleek and pin-straight. If you have layers, and you like a tool that gives your lengths some movement, the former might be a better option, or one of Shark’s round blowdry brushes.  </p>



<p>At $249.99, it’s not exactly budget-friendly, but it is slightly more affordable than the AirStrait.</p>

<h2>What to know about Shark’s SilkiPro Straight Wet to Dry Straightener + Rapid Blow Dryer </h2>



<p><strong>• </strong>A straightener-meets-blowdryer featuring different levels of airflow and temperature-controlled ceramic plates for straightening, blow-drying, and creating waves. </p>



<p><strong>• </strong>Comes with three slide-in comb attachments: a wide-tooth comb for curly or coily hair, a gentle comb for natural straight styles, and a precision comb for maximum tension. </p>



<p>• Lightweight, quiet, and suitable for all hair types.  </p>



<h2>How do you use Shark’s SilkiPro Straight? </h2>



<p>Although “wet” is in the name, SilkiPro is best used on damp or towel-dried hair. I used the blowdryer function to rough-dry my hair to about 90% dry before switching to the “For WET Hair” setting on medium heat with full airflow. Happily, you can choose both the temperature and airflow level to suit you. </p>



<p>I have one stubborn step-like wave at the back of my head, which hairstylists usually struggle to smooth with a blowdryer and round brush, but this smoothed them out in just two passes. The chunky ceramic plates, combined with the extra airflow, work together to make hair silky, straight, and soft without much effort. </p>



<p>While the tool itself looks quite large, I can confirm that because the ceramic plates extend all the way to the tip, it’s easy to reach the roots and smooth out frizz and flyaways. I managed to straighten all my hair in just 10 minutes, when it usually takes me 30. Some might call it sorcery, but I know Shark has been quietly perfecting this behind the scenes for years. </p>



<p>Beyond the smart plates and directed airflow, the gentle comb attachment helped the tool glide through my knotty hair like a hot knife through butter. I also love that the tool quiets down when you put it down and starts up again when you pick it up, making it less overstimulating. </p>

<p>I’ve been to a lot of fashion shows. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-street-style"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">New York Fashion Week</a> is basically a sport at this point and I’m basically an Olympian. You prep, you glam, you Uber in heels because you can’t actually walk in them, and you pray the show starts late. I’ve mastered the rhythm. I know how to move. But this time, it felt different. Because for the first time ever, I wasn’t just attending a show, I was being dressed for one. And not just by anyone. By <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sergiohudson/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sergio Hudson</a>. For his <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-ready-to-wear/sergio-hudson"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Fall/Winter 2026</a> runway. On his 10th anniversary. I’m still pinching myself.  </p>



<p><strong>My Favorite Room During Fashion Week</strong> </p>



<p>Sergio Hudson’s show is hands down my favorite show to attend during New York Fashion Week. The collections are always versatile. Whether you’re a corporate baddie running a boardroom, the belle of the ball at a gala, or just a fashion girly who loves to throw that fit on, Sergio has a piece for you. And his casting is inclusive. Always. In a fashion world that still struggles with representation, his runway actually looks like us.   </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960041.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The room itself feels like the hottest and chicest invite of the year but never exclusive in a weird way. Everyone from <a href=""https://www.gettyimages.dk/detail/news-photo/yolanda-adams-sergio-hudson-and-monica-attend-sergio-hudson-news-photo/2261636426"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Monica</a> to <a href=""https://hellobeautiful.com/4581318/jackie-aina-nyfw/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jackie Aina</a> was there. And somehow, no one feels more important than the other. You feel like you belong. </p>



<p><strong>The Showroom Moment</strong> </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960042.jpg?width=583&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=583%3A1024"" /><figcaption>Screenshot</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>A few days before the show, I went to the Sergio Hudson showroom to find my look. My first option was a red blazer moment. It was giving “I own the company,” but I wasn’t fully sold. I wanted a <em>moment</em>. Then one of the stylists pulled out a silver sequin dress and I knew. I paired it with a gray wool coat draped over my shoulders and yeah, this was the bold statement I needed to make. It felt regal, dramatic, and intentional. All I needed were silver heels to finish it off. If you’re going to be dressed by Sergio Hudson for his 10th anniversary show, you don’t play small. </p>



<p><strong>Fashion Week Tried Me</strong> </p>



<p>Now here’s where the plot thickens. Show day was a mess. On the day of the show, I still hadn’t found the perfect shoes. I had two hair appointments. I had to shower, do my makeup, get dressed, and be there by 6:45 PM. </p>



<p>Appointments got pushed. My hair didn’t finish until 5 PM. I rushed home, threw on my dress, did my makeup with one eye on the clock, and ran out the door. I got in the Uber at 6:20 PM. and because it’s New York… traffic!  </p>



<p>What should have been a quick ride turned into over an hour. I was panicking the entire time. All that prep. All that anticipation. Just to possibly miss the show? I felt defeated sitting in that back seat. But by the grace of God, I made it. The show started ten minutes after I arrived. And I’m choosing to be a delusional queen and believe they stalled it for me.  </p>



<p><strong>10 Years of Excellence</strong> </p>



<p>The collection was out of this world. Bold colors. Chic tailoring. Fierce models. Looks that quite literally took your breath away. It felt celebratory but forward. A reminder that ten years in this industry, especially as a Black designer, is no small thing.  </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.essence.com/fashion/sergio-hudson-10th-anniversary-show-fashion-fw26-nyfw/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ten years </a>of vision. Ten years of staying true. Ten years of dressing powerful women and men in pieces that command attention.  </p>

<p>It’s safe to say my outfit was a hit. As I walked into the show and later as walked out, people were taking photos of me. Complimenting the dress. Stopping me mid-step. For a moment, I felt like a queen.  </p>



<p>Being dressed by a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-designers-fashion-technology"">Black designer</a>, celebrating his milestone, and sitting in a room filled with culture, excellence, and intention will always be one of the highlights of my career.  </p>



<p>Supporting Black-owned designers like Sergio Hudson isn’t just about fashion, it’s about community. It’s about showing up for the people who reflect us, design for us, and see us. I already can’t wait for the next show. </p>

<p>Over the last week, New York City proved its status as a fashion capital of the world, with talented designers showcasing creative collections on the runways, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-street-style"">in the streets</a>, and on our feeds. From “let them eat cake” aesthetics and double-duty bags to fringed frocks and leather opera gloves, New York Fashion Week brought <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-color-trends-2026"">statement fashion trends</a> and serious 2026 outfit inspo to the forefront.<br /><br />In order to get the front-row scoop on what will be huge for the fall and winter of 2026, I attended so many fashion shows and presentations that my heels hurt and phone was always on the brink of losing power. The endeavor was more than worth it because I found the standout trends (that I think you can start implementing into your wardrobe while it’s still cold!). The wonderfully disheveled <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/saltburn-indie-sleaze-2000s-fashion"">indie sleaze look</a> and head-to-toe <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-cow-print"">animal prints</a> that dominated New York’s runways are especially great for party looks, while <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/02/11305994/brooch-fashion-accessory-trend"">brooches</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-balaclavas-bonnets-knitted-hooded-scarf"">headwear</a> can add flair to any winter outfit.<br /><br />Ahead, see which brands — from New York staples like Tory Burch to NYFW debuts like that of designer-denim staple 7 For All Mankind — took on similar trends in their own unique points of view.  Then shop styles to get the looks.</p>

<h2>Vintage-Inspired Brooches for Today</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959927.png?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>Wondering what the stand-out accessory of the A/W 2026 shows were? It <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shoe-trends-2026"">wasn’t just one shoe trend</a> or a particular purse or a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-tarnish-free-gold-jewelry"">statement necklace</a>. It was the brooch. Ranging from metal sculptures from the likes of Caroline Herrera, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-x-cult-gaia-collaboration-shop"">Cult Gaia</a>, and Tory Burch; crystal cascades courtesy of Collina Strada; 3D glass florals by Caroline Zimbalist; and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUvv79tCbKo/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sergio Hudson</a>’s fabric-covered designs, many brands put their seal of approval on a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/designer-fashion-secondhand-the-realreal-ebay-poshmark"">vintage staple</a>.<br /><br />These modern designs might look out of place in your grandmother’s jewelry box (but that doesn’t mean she won’t want to borrow your baubles from time to time!). Pin them to your sweater, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-jackets-for-women"">winter coat</a>, or to secure your scarf for fashion <em>and</em> function. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Animals Gone Wild</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959932.png?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>I can confidently say that animal prints will never go out of style. In fact, they’ve essentially become neutrals that can seamlessly integrate into everyone’s wardrobes today. This season, brands like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/old-navy-anna-sui-collaboration-2025"">Anna Sui</a>, Norma Kamali, Ralph Lauren, and Ulla Johnson tapped the fan-favorite cheetah and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-leopard-print-2"">leopard prints</a>. Looking to find inspiration from other corners of the animal kingdom? Kim Shui and Markarian introduced tiger prints, while Kate Hundley and Sergio Hudson offered snakeskin sets, and Bronx and Banco sent out a zebra purse.<br /><br />Animal illustrations were also big sources of inspiration, as Alix of Bohemia featured a whole zoo worth of animal prints and embellishments (think: giraffes and monkeys!). Swans also popped up across Tanner Fletcher outerwear and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DU4lDRfiI_F/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Aknvas</a> button-downs if avian-inspired looks are more your style.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong>The Grunge &amp; Indie Sleaze Scene</strong></h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959934.png?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>For those of us who <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-sandy-liang-collaboration-2025"">crave nostalgia</a>, it’s exciting to note that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/madewell-alexa-chung-collaboration-2025"">the ‘90s</a> and early 2000s have never been more back! Specifically, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/joaquina-90s-grunge-era-jcpenney-collection"">moody grunge</a> and indie sleaze party-girl aesthetics are having a moment, with dark palettes, messy styling, and even disheveled, slept-in hair (look no further than Collina Strada’s models for proof). <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-dresses-for-women"">Plaid prints</a> featured heavily in the anchor pieces of several collections, including <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/coach-handbag-trends"">Coach</a>’s youthful blazers as well as Collina Strada’s and Private Policy’s dresses.<br /><br />The <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUuHzuajEmc/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">7 For All Mankind runway show</a> was also a master class in early-aughts styling, down to the energy and even the <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUuXgANjkvZ/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">models’ viral walks</a>. Think, lots of layering, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/denim-trends-2026"">all-denim-everything</a>, skinny scarves, platform pumps, jumbo shoulder bags, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-chunky-jewelry"">chunky jewelry</a> all together — because in this case, more is more. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Hat Attack</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959935.png?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>Bundling up in the cold has never looked so chic. Hats and headpieces served as the cherry on top of this season’s runway looks, serving inspiration for right now and next winter. Designers especially made the case for having headwear for every outfit and event, no matter how casual or fancy. Designs included chic pillbox hats and caps that tie around the neck (Christian Cowan), fur trapper hats and headbands (Aknvas and Bronc and Banco), oversized knit silhouettes (Advisry), extra-long beanies (Private Policy), lace skull caps (Prabal Gurung and LaQuan Smith), and beaded head coverings (Jane Wade) across womenswear <em>and</em> menswear alike.<br /><br />The impossibly stylish <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/02/11856777/asap-rocky-verdict-court-case-timeline"">A$AP Rocky</a> even wore a fur trapper to close out the NYFW debut of his brand AWGE, giving hats a celebrity stamp of approval! </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>All Laced Up</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959936.png?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>While the collections that New York City’s designers showed this season weren’t as stiff or structured as some in the past, lacing still showed up as a major throughline. For proof, look no further than Adeam’s, Elena Velez’s, and Meruert Tolegen’s not-so-basic corsets and dresses.<br /><br />Those seeking more casual interpretations of the trend can turn to Kate Hundley’s lace-up <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-puffer-jacket"">puffer jacket</a>, which is proof that your winter puffer can not only not ruin your outfit; it can make your entire look. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUxFffpjp26/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Gabe Gordon</a>’s lace-up knit skirt also feels as right for après ski as it does for a Saturday <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nyfw-fall-winter-2024-trends"">athleisure look</a>. Laces even made their way into the models’ hair at Caroline Zimbalist as an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-haircut-trends-fall-winter-2026"">unexpected hairstyle trend</a>.</p>

Having a pair felt like everything. I remember dreaming about them, imagining how it would feel to finally wear them and show them off,” she told the publication. <br /><br />The sneakers were so popular among Latine youth that Reebok even collaborated with the biggest star of reggaeton at the time, Daddy Yankee, for a “DY” signature sneaker and apparel line in 2005.<br /><br />Now, with reggaeton one of the most popular genres in the world and Karol G as one of its front-runners, it’s her turn. And the Grammy award-winning singer isn’t just wearing Reebok Classics like she dreamed — campaign photos of her in the 131-year-old footwear brand can be seen all over, from Medellín to the rest of the world. <br /><br />As part of “Born Classic. Worn For Life,” the sports culture brand launched its most popular lifestyle sneakers crafted in 100% real, full-grain premium garment leather, including Club C 85 Vintage, Freestyle Lo, Workout Plus. <br /><br />And while the sneakers were just made available on February 18, <a href=""https://wwd.com/footwear-news/shoe-trends/karol-g-reebok-ambassador-media-impact-value-1238514597/"">WWD reported</a> in late January that just the announcement of Karol G as Reebok’s latest ambassador generated $1.1 million in Media Impact Value (MIV) in 48 hours for the footwear brand. <br /><br />Swipe to see what all the hype is about.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

<p>The Netflix docuseries, which premiered on February 11, featured firsthand accounts from models, including <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ebonyehaith/?hl=en"">Ebony Haith</a> (Cycle 1), <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/shandithecatlady/?hl=en"">Shandi Sullivan</a> (Cycle 2) and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/danievans1/?hl=en"">Danielle Evans</a> (Cycle 6) as well as judges <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/mrjaymanuel/?hl=en"">Jay Manuel</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/miss_jalexander/?hl=en"">J. Alexander</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/nigelbarker/?hl=en"">Nigel Barker</a>. Through three episodes, viewers get a firsthand look at the exploitative conditions contestants were subjected to each cycle. That included extreme makeovers using plastic surgery and dental work, blackface and racist stereotypes as photoshoot themes and a sexual assault that was intentionally caught on film. Banks and former <em>ANTM</em> executive producer <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0596298/"">Ken Mok</a>, who both served as executive producers for <em>Reality Check</em>, were also interviewed.</p>



<p>For 24 cycles, Banks was able to bully women into becoming the American ideal standard of what the “ideal woman” was at that time. And for millennials who were coming of age at the height of the show, it was not only appointment television; it was a rubric for how to become worthy of adoration.</p>

<p><em>ANTM</em> was one of the first times millennials witnessed hyperfemininity politics on display in the media through a reality show competition. As a little Black girl from the Midwest, watching the women who looked like me on the show further ingrained a conditioning that was already at play: that, to the world, I could only be beautiful with conditions. With <em>Reality Check</em>, flashbacks of Ebony’s gorgeous skin being called dull and ashy came rushing to the forefront. Danielle Evans being pressured to close her gap influenced me to want braces (thank you for not acquiescing, mom). Watching judges dismiss the concerns of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/iamtoccarajones/?hl=en"">Tocarra Jones</a> (Cycle 3), a full-figured woman from my hometown who I grew up looking up to, injured my confidence as I grew into my own curves.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Banks skirts accountability in an astonishingly delusional manner throughout the docuseries. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>And as a child, I was convinced Black girls couldn’t show their hurt like <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1909197/"">Tiffany Richardson</a> (Cycle 4) did, lest be seen as aggressive, ungrateful and undeserving.</p>



<p>“It was very, very intense but you guys were demanding it, and so we kept pushing more and more and more,” Banks said in <em>Reality Check</em>.</p>



<p>Banks skirts accountability in an astonishingly delusional manner throughout the docuseries. The trauma this show left with these women — especially the sexual assault of Shandi, which the documentary doesn’t name as such — was real, and Banks is to blame. At the same time, there’s some validity in her statement that we can’t ignore. No, viewers didn’t force Banks to exploit these women,  and much of the trauma they were subjected to has come into perspective only recently, but the buck doesn’t stop with Banks or this show.</p>

<p><em>ANTM</em> wasn’t just a look into the exploitative extremes models experienced behind the scenes. It held a mirror up to the homogenous beauty standards that Americans celebrated in the early to mid aughts. The message was resounding: thin and white was right. And if you were a woman of color, you better adapt quickly if you want to get anywhere.</p>



<p>As we sit firmly in 2026, it’s clear how wrong Banks and the producers were in their abuse of power. But what’s being overlooked is that history is repeating itself right before our eyes.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p><em>ANTM</em> wasn’t just a look into the exploitative extremes models experienced behind the scenes.

<p>With social media, there’s an insurmountable pressure that comes with showing up as your best. And unlike in 2003, the feedback is in real time. With a growing amount of content creators and influencers relying on social media platforms for their livelihoods, it takes more time, energy and money than ever before to keep up with appearances. For many, that’s the difference between economic stability or missing out on opportunities.</p>



<p>Body positivity feels like a thing of the past as the idea of thinness reemerges as a status symbol and the <a href=""https://www.today.com/video/cosmetic-surgery-is-drawing-younger-patients-and-more-men-250889285677"">demand for cosmetic procedures</a> for younger groups increases. Doctors and marketers <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/glp-1-brands-enter-their-super-bowl-era/"">push GLP-1s</a> on any and everyone regardless of clinical need. And <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sydney_sweeney/"">Sydney Sweeney’s</a> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/08/11924722/sydney-sweeney-american-eagle-ad-controversy-republican-trump"">“great jeans” American Eagle ad</a> feels in conversation with <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/miketyson/"">Mike Tyson’s</a> <a href=""https://mashable.com/article/mike-tyson-super-bowl-ad-maha-fatphobia"">fat shaming Super Bowl ad</a> funded by Make America Healthy Again.</p>



<p>In addition, the needle hasn’t moved much on Black women being labeled “aggressive” and facing <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/07/11923428/jana-craig-love-island-kenny-rodriguez-breakup"">microaggressions and outright racism</a> on and off screen. Even in the show “The Traitors,” Black contestants are given <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/jan/09/black-contestants-the-traitors-reality-tv"">far less grace</a> to prove themselves as “faithfuls” due to stereotypes being used as evidence of their integrity.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959856.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=799&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A799"" /></figure>



<p>So many of us who watched <em>ANTM</em> growing up have done work to divorce ourselves from the limiting beliefs that the show and others instilled in us growing up. (For me, that looked like embracing my curves and natural hair.) But witnessing progressive ideas of beauty disappear in media while it simultaneously shames Banks feels a bit hypocritical.</p>



<p>It’s frustrating to see Banks refuse to take accountability for her wrongdoings and have the nerve to tease a Cycle 25 that may go to less extremes but will be likely to fall into old patterns. But what’s also true is that she is the perfect scapegoat for this moment to keep us comfortable in repeating the same mistakes. There’s a regressiveness happening that we can’t ignore. Today, it’s a reality check that our favorite show perpetuated the same system it said it wanted to change. Tomorrow it’s something far more sinister. </p>
