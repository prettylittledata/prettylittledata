<p>B.Red House is situated within an urban development governed by fixed planning regulations, where the latitude for architectural self-expression is narrowed by the imperative to maintain a unified overall appearance. The extended sameness across successive building masses has, perhaps inevitably, produced a sense of order bordering on monotony—an environment in which individual houses appear to share a common formal vocabulary. Within such a context, the pursuit of self-definition becomes challenging, as each building must sustain its own internal logic while still operating within the predetermined limits of an established urban typology.</p>",

<p>The house is located in one of the villages near Warsaw, close to a river, surrounded by a gently sloping mixed forest. The owners say they bought it by accident when they met a real estate agent while walking their dog, who led them to a pyramid-like building hidden among the trees. It turned out to be an uninhabited residence, which the local militia commander had dreamed of owning. The building was constructed between 1976 and 1981 during a period of crisis and low availability of building materials. It was built from whatever could be obtained from construction sites and renovations of infrastructure facilities: for example, the ceilings were made of tram rails, which were laid at a slight slope above the ground floor, as they pierced through the outer wall and became part of the terrace structure. Thanks to its slight slope, the terrace was naturally drained. At the same time, the floor in the living room behind the wall had a noticeable slope, and the wall was blackened by the cold and moisture penetrating through the rails. The original construction documentation consisted of a few A4 pages with very sketchy drawings and one page of laconic description.</p>",

<p>Are living spaces getting smaller? As cities densify and the global population continues its steady migration toward urban centers—projected to reach around 70% by 2050—domestic space is becoming increasingly compressed. Rising land prices, high construction costs, and a surge in single-person households push developers toward smaller units and tighter floor plans. At the same time, cultural shifts toward resource efficiency and minimal living support this move. <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1020291/design-solutions-for-small-living-maximizing-space-in-apartments-under-40-square-meters"">Shrinking living spaces</a> require fewer materials, consume less energy, and encourage people to live closer to their means. </p>",

<p>Thanks to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DOj62CbDHoi/?hl=en"">nail artist Grethel</a>, traditional tortoiseshell nails have had an upgrade just in time for the holidays.

<p>These split ombré nails are like an optical illusion, evoking the shadowy winter moon. We especially love the gradient, which seamlessly blends midnight and baby blue. Nail artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DQ4h7-_j_5m/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Brittney Ellen</a> explains that the ombré is flipped on the French tip to trick the eye.</p>

Warrant’s “Cherry Pie”, The Runaways’ “Cherry Bomb”, Hozier’s “Cherry Wine”... There’s a reason why so many artists — spanning decades and genres — are inspired by one commonplace fruit. On the one hand, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tiktok-cherry-cola-lips-trend-hack"">cherries</a> represent the simple sweetness of youth and capture the heady nostalgia of long summer days (life is but a bowl of cherries, after all). On the other hand, they’re shorthand for sex, seduction, and a loss of innocence (think the sultry lyrics of Lana Del Rey or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUtDwWp17tM""><em>Twin Peaks’ </em>Audrey Horne</a> tying a cherry stem with her tongue). <br /><br />In the art world, cherries are symbolic of wealth and decadence. The <a href=""https://arthive.com/publications/316~Life_is_just_a_bowl_of_cherries_Top_10_paintings_rendering_cherries#google_vignette"">Dutch Old Masters</a> couldn’t get enough of them in their elaborate still lifes, spilling out of ornate silver dishes with bouquets. The same can be said for cherry fragrances. A cherry note is never just one thing — it can be sweet and succulent, bright and tart, or deep and indulgent. Whatever it’s mixed with can also completely change the game, whether that’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/oakcha-perfume-dupes-review"">rich ouds, boozes and spices</a>, earthy leather and wood notes, florals, or other fruits. <br /><br />Thanks to this versatility and complexity, cherry fragrances have long been topping ‘viral fragrance’ lists (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/trending-perfume-fragrance-2024"">especially our own</a>). In fact, you’d be hard-pressed not to find <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/lost-cherry-P436489?skuId=2369213"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tom Ford’s Lost Cherry</a> and <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/lovefest-eau-de-parfum-intense-P501018"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kayali’s Lovefest Burning Cherry</a> in the bathroom cabinets of the coolest people you know.

It’s definitely the sexiest fragrance in my arsenal and my go-to when I want to boost my confidence.

Sadly, this is neither nutritious nor cost-effective, so failing that, I want to smell like them. This fragrance hits the nail on the head at first spritz. Like those luminous red cherries, it’s zingy, sweet, and moreish, and smells exactly like a maraschino-steeped cocktail. The issue with most cherry perfumes, though, is that the zinginess doesn’t last too long. However, that’s not entirely a bad thing. This dries down to something sweet and delicate — like hints of cherry with subtle florals. The staying power is impressive for a high-street perfume at this price; I could still smell it on my wrists hours later but it lasts much longer on clothes. Thanks to its lightness I think this would make for a better spring scent. I want something deeper and more brooding for fall and winter.

Since its 2018 release, it kickstarted a craze for not-so-simple, not-so-saccharine-sweet cherry scents, and rather grown-up, elegant, and complex fragrances. To me, this is a delectable cherry cocktail in perfume form. Up top, you have the first sip of black cherry and cherry liqueur, which makes way for the rich and intoxicating mix of bitter almond, warm vanilla, roasted tonka bean, and cinnamon. As such, it’s less of a straight cherry perfume compared to some others on this list, and perhaps not the one for you if you want that long-lasting cherry scent following you all day. Still, it has a real irresistible draw — an almost edible richness that has you wanting more and more (again, just like a great cocktail).” <em>— Esther Newman</em><br /><br /><strong>Tom Ford</strong> Lost Cherry Eau de Parfum 30ml, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP436489"">Sephora</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1500"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11776614.jpeg?auto=webp&amp;width=1500&amp;height=1500&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1500"" /><figcaption><strong><h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/yves-saint-laurent-black-opium-eau-de-parfum-over-red-P509702"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Yves Saint Laurent Black Opium Over Red Eau de Parfum</a>, $130</h2></strong><br /><br />“As someone who doesn’t even like eating cherries, I am surprised by how much I enjoyed this cherry-heavy perfume. You can immediately catch the juicy cherry upon the first spray, but it quickly transforms from a fruity gourmand to a sensual floral, thanks to notes of jasmine and orange blossoms. It then develops into something muskier after drying down, with the base notes of vanilla and patchouli warming up my skin. This is also when the sweet whiffs of coffee beans emerge. It smells nothing like the medicinal cherry flavoring you get in your cough syrup as a child, but rather, a bold gourmand fragrance that has several interesting identities.

Alongside the cherry, there are sweet florals, vanilla, then amber and woodsy notes for balance. I adore a fragrance that balances femininity with earthy grit — to me, that is what makes it sexy and sophisticated. The catch? Usually, these kinds of scents wear full-bodied on me, so I was expecting this to come with a powerful throw based on first impressions. Cherry Ambition, however, turns to a gentler, near-skin scent after a couple of hours of wear. I don’t mind that, though; it makes it appropriate for everyday settings, like an office, rather than being a fragrance I’d save purely for the nighttime. Another thing to note is how stunning the packaging is. I love how on the back of the bottle you get a recommendation as to what the fragrance is best for: “Feeling brave, igniting ambition, making a statement”. I might not manage to feel these things every day, but a few sprays of this on my neck and wrists bring me a step closer.” <em>— Tanyel Mustafa</em><br /><br /><strong>The 7 Virtues</strong> Cherry Ambition Eau de Parfum 50ml, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP508411"">Sephora</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1970"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11776635.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=1970&amp;height=1970&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1970"" /><figcaption><strong><h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fcreed-carmina-eau-de-parfum%2F7561368"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Creed Carmina Eau de Parfum</a>, $310</h2></strong><br /><br />“Forget everything you think you know about cherry perfumes.

The breaths of rose de mai, violet, and peonies are so vivid that this might not be your kind of scent if you’re not into florals. I happen to absolutely love how this intensely feminine scent fills the room. It makes me feel so sultry and grown up, like I’m wandering around in a slinky velvet gown.

Just like your skin fresh out of the shower, this is definitely one of those ‘your skin but better scents’.

<p>When I was an eager intern, drafted in to clean out a magazine’s burgeoning beauty cupboard, my then manager gave me a piece of advice that would stay with me: “If nothing else, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/drunk-elephant-therabu-hand-cream-review"">look after your hands</a> and feet.” She was convinced that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-simple-skincare-routine"">12-step skincare routines</a> were overrated (a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-cleanser-face-wash-oily-skin"">simple cleanser</a>, moisturizer <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/spf-sunscreen-benefits-fall-winter"">and sunscreen</a> will often suffice). But considering how much we put our hands <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/05/10967072/podiatrist-pedicure-tips-for-soft-feet"">and feet</a> through daily, she always drove home how important it is to show them a little extra TLC when possible. </p>



<p>Since then, I’ve tried my best to follow her example, though it’s difficult for someone with perpetually <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/02/10853165/how-to-stop-hands-aging-steps"">parched hands</a>, further exacerbated by cold weather and heating. Over the years, I’ve also learned that not all hand creams are created equal. Most are sticky and don’t bode well for phone screens; others sting (a no-go for chapped knuckles), and some are so thin they don’t do much at all. </p>



<p>Keen to find the “Goldilocks” of hand creams — essentially the one that ticks all of my boxes — I made it my mission to try as many products down to the very last drop over the winter. Some of these hand creams have been recommended by top dermatologists, while others have gone so viral on TikTok that I couldn’t resist trying them out. Fast forward to this month, and I think I might’ve found the cream of the crop. </p>



<p>Without further ado, read ahead for my honest thoughts on $195 worth of hand creams.</p>

<p>Last year, I was lucky enough to go skincare shopping in Paris with<a href=""https://justinehextall.co.uk/justine""> dermatologist Dr. Justine Hextall</a>. There were probably a hundred hand creams lining the shelves of the French pharmacies we visited, but she picked out this fragrance-free version for my very dry skin. Dr. Hextall encouraged me to slather on a generous amount before bed and to pull on a pair of cotton gloves (you could also use a pair of socks!), kind of like a makeshift overnight hand mask. I saw the best results when I used this consistently. It’s all down to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sunday-riley-b3-nice-niacinamide-serum-review"">hydrating niacinamide</a>, skin-smoothing shea butter, and a whopping 30% <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-is-glycerin"">glycerin, a humectant</a>, which draws moisture into the skin. Thanks to dimethicone, a type of silicone, it makes hands feel silky rather than sticky, but it’s quite thick in texture and takes a moment to absorb fully. I ran out of the 50ml version too quickly, so I’d recommend spending a little bit more on the 100ml tube.  </p>

<p>I have to get one gripe out of the way first: The packaging might be “spillproof,” but it isn’t user-friendly. You have to give this a good squeeze to release the lotion, and even then, it’s pretty difficult to get much out. I’m not the only one. Countless reviewers say the same, and when your hands are feeling sore, that’s the last thing you need. Packaging aside, I love the chic scent (that’ll be creamy jasmine, zippy lemon, and comforting cashmere wood), and the cream softens tight, dry hands without a hint of slipperiness.</p>

<p>This is a hand cream first and an aromatherapy treatment second — it smells incredible. A few essential oils are behind the soothing scent, so it’s not something I’d recommend for those with very sore or chapped hands in case of irritation, but it’s still high up on my list. That’s because it boasts moisturizing glycerin, softening shea butter, and nourishing castor oil — three ingredients that breathe life into my dry, ashy hands. Don’t let that fool you into thinking it’ll leave you with greasy fingertips, though. My hands drink it up quickly, and it’s become my favorite hand cream for on-the-go top-ups. As you can probably tell by the state of this tube, it’s a purse staple.</p>

<p>I’ve been through multiple tubs of CeraVe’s Moisturizing Cream over the years, but it’s too big to carry around with me. Enter: Reparative Hand Cream. It features the same skin-strengthening ceramides, which act like glue in between skin cells to keep the skin barrier intact and moisture under lock and key. It sinks in fast, too. I looked to this when my hands were cracked and sore, and it helped to heal them quickly, but I found that I needed to layer up throughout the day. Still, it’s more or less traceless — and fragrance-free — so that didn’t bother me. I just need it to come in a bigger tube. </p>

<p>In the past couple of months, I’ve been through two 150ml tubes of this hand cream; nothing else has eradicated my dry skin quite like it. The star ingredients are 20% shea butter, which moisturizes deeply, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/beta-glucan-skincare-benefits"">beta-glucan</a>, which experts are championing as the new, more hydrating hyaluronic acid. Not only does this ingredient soothe and soften skin instantly, but it’s known to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/beta-glucan-skincare-benefits"">repair and heal</a> over time. L’Occitane promises eight hours of intense hydration — and I believe it. I apply this before bed, and when I wake up, my hands look brand new. Even when I wash my hands after using it, they’re still unbelievably soft. Seeing as it’s substantially quenching, it takes about a minute for my hands to soak it up properly, but it works a treat. Dry skin? Don’t know her. This is my number one. </p>

<p>This absorbs easily and is packed with skin-repairing ceramides, moisturizing glycerin, and quenching shea butter — but it’s pricier than other hand creams on this list with very similar properties. For me, the main selling point is that I can use my phone or laptop almost immediately, and because it’s formulated without perfume, it doesn’t tingle or sting when applied to broken skin. I also like that you can squeeze every last drop out of the aluminum tube. It’s certainly chic, so if you have more to spend, why not? </p>

<p>If it’s instant relief you’re after, Aveeno has got you covered. This takes all of 30 seconds to disappear into dry hands (I counted), doesn’t leave behind any greasy residue, and makes rough skin feel much softer thanks to moisturizing glycerin and cushiony dimethicone. While it does the job, my dry hands require regular applications throughout the day, especially after washing. All in all, it makes a great desk hand cream for frequent typers. </p>

<p>I thought this hand cream would be all smell, no substance, but I’m very happy to be proven wrong. With coconut oil, squalane, and sodium hyaluronate (a type of hyaluronic acid), it’s considerably moisturizing and melted into my dry hands almost instantly. For those familiar with the brand’s viral Cheirosa ’62 fragrance, this hand cream is equally as beachy and sunscreen-y in smell, and the perfume lingered on my skin for a good while — even after I washed my hands. I keep this on my desk at home for a mid-afternoon pick-me-up. (It might be a little too potent for the office…)</p>

<p>It’s official: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">we’ve entered Sagittarius Season</a> in full force, and with that comes a collective vibe shift that’s both undeniable and kind of a cosmic whiplash. We’re saying bye to the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Fixed water Scorpio Season</a>, with its secrecy, shadow work, and “let me spiral in peace” emotional intensity. In its place? The boundless optimism, reckless  honesty, and restless wanderlust of Mutable Fire for the next four weeks.  </p>



<p>Sagittarius Season isn’t here to make you sit with your feelings… it’s here to make you book a one-way ticket to <em>anywhere else</em> and sprint toward the next philosophical adventure. And yet, this fiery shift doesn’t mean we can  escape our responsibilities. It just means we’re <em>less afraid to face them</em>. From the way we communicate to how we reimagine our future, this is the week where bold moves feel less scary and more inevitable. </p>



<p>But don’t let the Jupiterian vibes fool you, this week also marks the end of a sobering  cosmic chapter. After 4.5 months of retrograde motion, Saturn, the Planet of  Responsibility, shifts direct in Pisces on November 27th, for the last time in this sign for the next 29 years. That’s huge. For many of us, Saturn in Pisces has been about emotional boundaries, intuitive discipline, and learning how to structure our dreams without suffocating them. As it stations direct, there’s a final karmic checkpoint: did you  learn how to trust your inner compass, or are you still outsourcing your intuition?  </p>



<p>Add to that Mercury’s direct station in Scorpio on the 29th at 12:38 p.m. EST, and we’re closing the month with both of our major “slow down and process” planets now moving forward in <em>Water signs </em>— even as fire sign season is heating up. The result? An internal green light, but with a caution label. You’ve gotten the downloads, the reroutes, the delays. You’ve had to pause and pivot more times than you’d like. This week? You’ll start to understand <em>why</em>. And with that clarity comes momentum… slow, steady,  intentional momentum that actually lasts. </p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, you’re feeling the flames again. After a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">deeply introspective Scorpio Season</a>,  Sagittarius Season enters like a spontaneous road trip invitation. Suddenly, the shadows make sense, the storylines connect, and the lessons you learned are becoming launchpads for expansion. This is your exploring cycle, but Jupiter (the ruler of Sag Season) is still retrograde in Cancer in your sector of home, family, and roots. That means you’re feeling the pull to go big, yes, but with a tender undertone. You’re  not running away from where you come from; you’re seeking experiences that remind you who you are at your core. Honor the desire to dream wider, but check in with your inner child as you do. </p>



<p>This week also marks the end of Saturn’s retrograde in Pisces in your sector of  spirituality, healing, and closure. For four and a half months, Saturn has been silently schooling you on what it means to actually rest, to release, to retreat without guilt. Now that Saturn’s finally moving forward, so are you, and whether you’re aware of it or not, this has been a key rehearsal period for what’s ahead. In early 2026, Saturn will re-enter your sign, meaning you’re next. This week is a subtle spiritual graduation: you’ve passed some behind-the-scenes tests, you’ve gotten stronger through surrender. Start  noticing the ways you’ve outgrown old fears, habits, or identities without needing anyone’s permission to evolve. </p>



<p>By the time Mercury shifts direct in Scorpio on the 29th, you’ll feel an energetic exhale in your sector of shared resources, intimacy, and psychological depth. Money hiccups, trust wounds, and communication delays within your closest bonds may have been peaking throughout November. But now the fog lifts. Mercury’s direct motion signals clarity, even if it arrives in whispers rather than fireworks. Consider this week your moment of truth — a time to reassess your energetic investments, reclaim your power, and close out the month with financial and emotional sovereignty. You’ve earned it. </p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, you’ve been moving through a portal, and this week, you’re emerging from the  other side with wisdom that’s equal parts sobering and sacred. Sagittarius Season  activates your sector of death, rebirth, transformation, and merging. Translation? The phoenix within you is rising. After Scorpio Season forced you to confront your  relationships — romantic, business, and everything in between —Sagittarius Season dares you to ask: <em>What parts of myself am I willing to shed so I can finally fly free? </em>This is not surface-level growth. It’s soul-level metamorphosis.  </p>



<p>And since Jupiter, the ruler of this season, is still retrograde in Cancer (in your communication and thought-patterns sector), you may be feeling a mix of breakthroughs and nostalgia, especially around the stories you tell yourself. Let them shift. Let your inner narrator evolve too. </p>



<p>Saturn, the Planet of Responsibility, is also ending its retrograde in Pisces on the 27th, after four and a half months retrograde in your sector of social networks, tech, and collective dreams. If you’ve felt distance between you and your community, or you’ve questioned whether your goals even <em>matter </em>anymore, that fog is beginning to clear.  Saturn’s been showing you where to recommit and where to walk away. Now that it’s direct, you can start building again, but this time with discernment and vision. It’s a brilliant time to reassess your relationship to visibility, collaboration, and long-term  purpose. You don’t have to do it alone, Taurus. But you <em>do </em>have to choose alignment over convenience. </p>



<p>Two days later, Mercury shifts direct in Scorpio in your sector of marriage. After a month of cosmic curveballs, miscommunications, or shifts in partnerships (romantic or professional), this retrograde finally comes to a close. You’ve likely had to clarify your boundaries or renegotiate your agreements, and now the pieces are falling into place. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, this week feels like your season of “choose your character” has officially begun. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Sagittarius Season lights up</a> your sector of partnerships and contracts — both the romantic kind and the cosmic, soul-contract kind. You’re magnetizing new people and drawing clearer lines with others. It’s delicious, chaotic, and clarifying. But since  Sagittarius is your opposite sign, it’s also activating some growing pains. Jupiter, Sag’s ruler, is still retrograde in your money and self-worth sector, so some of the connections or opportunities showing up now may have roots in old stories around value, security, or financial independence. Don’t rush to say yes just to be liked or chosen. Your time, your body, your love — those are sacred currencies. Invest wisely. </p>



<p>Now let’s talk about Saturn ending its retrograde in Pisces in your sector of reputation  and legacy. After months of questioning your path, wondering if your work is “enough” or if you’re even <em>seen</em>, the tide is finally shifting. Saturn’s retrograde has been humbling. You’ve probably wrestled with imposter syndrome, restructured your ambitions, or asked yourself: <em>What kind of impact do I really want to leave behind? </em>This week marks a subtle but powerful new chapter. You’re being invited to lead differently — not louder,  not harder, but deeper. Let your vision mature. It doesn’t have to be perfect; it just has to be real. </p>



<p>And then there’s your ruler Mercury shifting direct in Scorpio in your sector of wellness, service, and daily rhythms. November may have brought scheduling nightmares, health  wake-up calls, or moments where you forgot how to speak kindly to yourself. Now, balance is returning. You’re remembering how good it feels to have a flow that honors your mind <em>and </em>your nervous system. Consider this week your reset button. You’re not a  productivity machine — you’re a multidimensional, brilliant being learning how to make space for rest, rituals, and joy. Let Mercury’s direct motion be your permission slip to slow down <em>and </em>still get things done. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, the sun is now in Sagittarius, igniting your sector of health for the next four weeks and you’re in your <em>“I’m rebuilding my life like it’s a cozy Pinterest board” </em>era. But  don’t get it twisted: this is spiritual decluttering. Sag Season doesn’t just ask you to “clean your space,” it wants you to clean your <em>mind</em>. You’re craving systems that support your growth without boxing you in. And with Jupiter retrograde in your sign right now, this week could feel like a cosmic reminder that your energy is precious and sacred — not to be scattered. The answers aren’t outside of you; they’re within your own body, in the cues it gives when something’s aligned… or not. </p>



<p>Saturn also stations direct in Pisces this week in your sector of higher education and long-term vision. You’ve been going through it quietly, huh? Maybe questioning your beliefs, your purpose, your faith. Maybe realizing that outgrowing old ideologies is grief work too. But now Saturn’s ready to move forward, and so are you. A new kind of truth is settling into your bones. One you earned through patience, humility, and the courage to begin again. This is a powerful time to recommit to your path, whether that’s a new spiritual practice, a travel plan, or a long-forgotten dream that still makes your heart beat faster. </p>



<p>To round it out, on the 29th Mercury finally ends its retrograde in Scorpio in your sector of creativity, play, and romantic expression. If November had you in a funk creatively or made you question your romantic instincts, you’re not alone. Now, the fog clears and you’re reconnecting with your muses — the ones that remind you life is meant to be felt, not managed. Love letters, dance breaks, flirty texts, solo adventures: this is your  medicine now. Mercury direct reminds you that joy isn’t a distraction from your purpose. It <em>is </em>your purpose. Sprinkle that magic everywhere you go. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, now that the sun (your ruler) is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">officially in Sagittarius</a>, your cosmic confidence is back online — and not a moment too soon. Scorpio Season may have humbled you (okay, dragged you), but this fire-on-fire moment feels like you’re finally glowing again. The Sag sun lights up your sector of creativity, pleasure, and romance, so flirt with fate, play with possibility, and don’t be afraid to risk looking ridiculous. You’re in a luckier,  lighter window, even with Jupiter retrograde in your career and legacy zone reminding  you to realign with your long-term purpose before rushing forward. Trust that you don’t  need to have it all figured out to take a leap of faith… just enough courage to follow what feels fun and aligned. </p>



<p>And as if that weren’t enough cosmic momentum, on the 27th Saturn in Pisces is stationing direct in your intimacy and emotional merging sector after a long retrograde that had you questioning who’s safe to let in. Now you’re clearer on your boundaries and what kind of soul ties actually nourish your spirit (hint: not trauma bonds). Around the 29th, Mercury retrograde in Scorpio ends in your home and roots sector, helping clear the fog around family dynamics, housing plans, or internal safety. Conversations about cohabitation, inheritance, or emotional truth may finally start flowing again. November ends with insight, closure, and a heart that’s ready to trust its beat again.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, this is your quarterly “let’s romanticize my healing journey” update. The sun in  Sagittarius now illuminates your sector of home, family, and foundation for the next  four weeks, asking: where do I feel safe to be my full, messy self? Scorpio Season taught you how to say what you mean, but now Sag Season teaches you how to let yourself be <em>held </em>while saying it. Even if <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter retrograde in Cancer</a> has been delaying  clarity in love or close connections, you’re being asked to trust the bigger divine timeline. Your peace is sacred, not negotiable. Even in the chaos, create a home within yourself. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Saturn stations direct in Pisces in your partnership zone on the 27th,  bringing major lessons (and possibly reconnections) in how you show up in your  bonds. What patterns have you matured out of? What emotional labor are you no longer available for? You’ve grown into someone who doesn’t mistake consistency for intimacy. And as your ruler Mercury stations direct in your communication sector two days later, the mental fog lifts. The misunderstandings, missed texts, and tech chaos that dominated early November will start to unravel. Use this week to get grounded before December launches you into a faster pace; the seeds you plant now will  blossom in the new year. </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, welcome to the wide-open skies of Sagittarius Season. After weeks of deep  emotional inventory and existential shedding, this Fire sign shift energizes your sector of communication, curiosity, and creative expression. You may feel more extroverted  again — like you’ve finally caught your breath after swimming through Scorpio’s intense waters. The Sag Sun gives you the green light to speak up, share boldly, and  explore new ideas, especially ones that have been whispering to you from the edges of your comfort zone. That said, Jupiter retrograde reminds you to pace yourself — if you say yes to everything, you’ll burn out before December even starts. </p>



<p>Saturn in Pisces ending its retrograde in your sector of health, habits, and service on the 27th is also a game changer. The past four and a half months have shown you where your boundaries need fortifying, especially around time, energy, and what you give to others versus what you keep for yourself. Now that Saturn’s no longer in review  mode, your efforts to create structure will feel more supported by the universe. And with Mercury in Scorpio shifting direct in your income and self-worth sector on the 29th, money convos, business plans, and confidence levels begin to stabilize. Trust that delays were protection, and your next steps are much clearer now. Clarity and charisma — your favorite combo — are making a comeback.</p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, you’ve made it. You’ve swum through the underworld of your own psyche and  you’re emerging renewed. While Sagittarius Season shifts the collective’s attention  outward, you’re still integrating the deep truths that Scorpio Season unearthed —  especially with Mercury still retracing your sign until it stations direct on the 29th. The  Sag Sun now highlights your value systems, money mindset, and self-esteem for the next four weeks.  </p>



<p>This first full week of Sag Season is a chance to check in with your relationship to worth — not just financial, but emotional, energetic, and spiritual. And since Jupiter’s retrograde is still moving through your expansion and belief sector, you’re being called to ask: what stories are still shaping how you show up in the world? And do they still serve you? </p>



<p>Meanwhile, on the 27th Saturn in Pisces’ direct motion in your sector of pleasure, dating, and creative flow helps you anchor into your joy with more maturity and  discernment. You’ve had to learn — sometimes the hard way — that just because something feels good doesn’t mean it’s <em>right</em>. But now you’re clearer about what kind of pleasure truly nourishes you.  </p>



<p>With Mercury stationing direct in your sign on the 29th, your voice gets stronger, your words land with more weight, and your ability to self-advocate returns. You’re closing out November feeling more embodied and self-assured than you’ve felt all year. It’s giving “rebirth in real time”, and you deserve every ounce of this glow. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, it’s your time — <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Sagittarius Season has officially arrived!</a> This first full week of your solar return season feels like coming home to yourself. But this year’s kickoff isn’t a sprint — it’s a fiery slow burn. With your ruler Jupiter still retrograde in Cancer, your sector of emotional intimacy and legacy is activated, inviting you to move with  more care, more depth, more intention. You’re used to flying by the seat of your pants, but the universe is reminding you that some of your greatest expansion comes from digging <em>inward </em>before soaring outward. Don’t rush the glow-up… let it smolder. That  balance of Fire and Water is your true key this week. </p>



<p>Now that Saturn is finally direct in your communication sector (starting the 27th) after four and a half months of testing your boundaries, your voice is stronger, your inner compass clearer. The fog around decision-making starts to lift, and when Mercury in Scorpio stations direct in your closure sector on the 29th, you’ll be able to finally release what’s been weighing on your subconscious. End-of-the-month clarity hits different when your birthday’s around the corner. You’re not just moving forward, you’re moving wisely. Give thanks for the lessons, but don’t pack them in your suitcase.  You’ve got new roads to ride. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, Sagittarius Season activates your sector of spirituality and closure for the next four weeks — a sacred zone of soul whispers and psychic integration. This first  full week of the season is not about running full speed ahead. Instead, it’s your cosmic permission slip to unplug, reflect, and wrap up what Scorpio Season helped you  confront emotionally. With Jupiter (the ruler of Sag Season) still retrograde in your partnership sector, any themes around giving too much or receiving too little are ripe for review. Be real with yourself: what relationships feel reciprocal, and what are you still keeping alive out of guilt or habit? </p>



<p>The big cosmic win this week? On the 27th Saturn, your ruling planet, finally shifts direct in Pisces, ending a four-and-a-half-month stretch of delays in your communication and boundary-setting sector. You’ve been working behind the scenes to say what you mean, mean what you say, and still hold space with grace. Now, your words land with clarity and power, especially as Mercury in Scorpio stations direct in  your social and friendship sector on the 29th. Group dynamics get smoother, and  miscommunications resolve. As November closes, you’re realigning your circle, your truth, and your focus. Don’t worry, Capricorn, you haven’t missed the train. You were <em>building </em>the right track. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, welcome to the first full week of Sagittarius Season, igniting your sector of  community, collaboration, and future dreams for the next four weeks. You’re feeling pulled toward your people and your <em>purpose</em>. But don’t forget: Jupiter’s still retrograde in your wellness and routine sector, encouraging you to slow down, restructure, and <em>listen </em>to your body’s cues. Just because the vibe is social doesn’t mean you have to overextend yourself. Be discerning, and protect your peace while still aligning with the collective vision you’re here to lead. You’ve got global goals but sustainable impact starts with internal stability. </p>



<p>This week’s astro-reset is <em>potent</em>: on the 27th your ruler Saturn finally stations direct in Pisces, in your financial and self-worth sector, after months of deep reflection and constraint. What have you learned about your resources, both tangible and emotional? You’ve been quietly leveling up your self-respect, and now it’s time to own that growth. And as Mercury ends its retrograde in Scorpio on the 29th, your career sector starts flowing again. That pitch, launch, or major conversation that’s been delayed? It’s now divinely timed. End the month with bold clarity and remember: your <em>uniqueness </em>is your currency. Cash in accordingly. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, Sagittarius Season fires up your sector of career, public image, and long-term  purpose for the next four weeks. You’re being called to boldly take up more space and yet, Jupiter (your planetary ruler) is retrograde in your creative sector, tugging at your inner world, reminding you not to abandon your soul’s poetry in pursuit of performance.  Balance is everything. This week, let your ambition and your artistry walk hand in hand. You’re not just building a legacy, you’re channeling magic into the material world. Trust your process, and don’t rush the reveal. You’re still mid-metamorphosis. </p>



<p>The real shift this week? Saturn ends its four-and-a-half-month retrograde in your sign (the final retrograde in Pisces for the next 29 years) — and that’s huge. You’ve been carrying invisible weights, navigating initiations only your spirit fully understands. Now, the fog begins to clear. You know who you are and what you will (and won’t) tolerate. With Mercury stationing direct in Scorpio on the 29th, your expansion and exploration  sector starts to click back into gear. Book the trip, start the class, write the pitch. You’re closing November with cosmic backing, and December will feel <em>much </em>more like the fresh chapter you’ve been waiting for. Let it begin. </p>

During “<a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/5shGj5OOnpmg4tQlFjyzZY"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">For Good</a>,” the movie’s title track, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/11/11816225/cynthia-erivo-wicked-review-elphaba-black"">Cynthia Erivo’s Elphaba</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GGs4fFd-kd0"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ariana Grande’s Glinda</a> dramatically say their goodbyes to each other through a dilapidated barrier, and through tears, of course. At the end of this scene, <a href=""https://www.eonline.com/ca/news/1425367/cynthia-erivo-reveals-wicked-for-good-unscripted-moment"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glinda and Elphaba</a> exchange three words that — until now — <a href=""https://variety.com/2025/film/awards/jon-m-chu-wicked-for-good-spoilers-ending-explained-1236587506/"">were forbidden</a> in the world composer Stephen Schwartz created: “I love you.” </p>



<p>The moment, like most things in director<a href=""https://www.goldderby.com/film/2025/wicked-for-good-director-jon-m-chu-interview/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> Jon M. Chu’s </a><em><a href=""https://www.goldderby.com/film/2025/wicked-for-good-director-jon-m-chu-interview/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wicked</a></em> universe, is devastatingly emotional, maximized to elicit big feelings from the audience, and anchored by two performances that, no matter how saccharine the material, pull the film back down to the ground. If “<a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7569880837202758943"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Defying Gravity</a>” was a confrontation between a budding radical and a well-meaning white moderate about how power corrupts and divides, “For Good” can be read as the reconciliation between two people with different approaches to the same problem: fighting facism. But also, it’s simply about the power of friendship. It’s about how friendship molds you, how it can be the thing that heals and bonds, and the relationship that reorganizes the molecules in your brain, shifting everything you thought you knew about yourself and the world around you. Friendship is what makes us whole. It’s what makes us human. And, most importantly, <em><a href=""https://variety.com/2025/film/news/box-office-wicked-for-good-opening-day-1236588784/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wicked: For Good</a> </em>is about how Elphaba and Glinda are the great loves of each other’s lives. </p>



<p>If you didn’t get all that from two witches singing harmonies only celestial beings could hit, maybe <em>Wicked</em> isn’t for you. And that’s OK. Some of my fellow critics have had harsh reactions to <em>Wicked: For Good. </em><a href=""https://www.npr.org/2025/11/20/nx-s1-5612585/wicked-for-good-review-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo"">NPR’s<em> </em>headline reads</a>, “This could have all been one movie” and <a href=""https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/movies/articles/wicked-good-review-finale-needlessly-170000405.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEOlEe0qKSwP09FIjZ8fkIvB65y1-yLw9Gwhlx9U5mBVejoizfBpQBPL9x8XJ6Xo0ddICnDXrBraIYpAn0iMZhqVawawoz_F5MjPKzI41Lr0TwMFvIg59D9-xSRYaX7_f1OewVAhCiaZham6CFIMDay2QscPapnsx2nkpDzEIZom"">IndieWire writes</a>, “Finale of a Needlessly Two-Part Movie Musical  Adaptation Doesn’t Go Out on a High Note.” <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/wicked-for-good-movie-review-23fe7244c429facf27442cbff470f67f"">AP News</a> went with a nod to <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>: “sorry, my pretty, ‘For Good’ doesn’t delight.” <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/11/wicked-for-good-movie-review/685003/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Atlantic:</a> “Wicked: For Good Bursts Its Own Bubble.” <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-current-cinema/wicked-for-good-is-very-very-bad"">The New Yorker’s review by Justin Chang</a> is the most ruthless, calling the movie “very, very bad” while chiding its “dreadful filmmaking.” Every one of these reviews make some fair points about the clunky inclusion of Dorothy, her cohort, and the effectiveness of <em>Wicked</em> as a prequel to <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2020/01/9321775/judy-garland-actress-true-story-life-death"">The Wizard of Oz</a></em>, but most of these critics didn’t like the first one either. And since, famously, part two of the musical has never been revered as highly as part one, those reactions were inevitable. But what so many of these detractors see as <em><a href=""https://www.slashfilm.com/2031892/wicked-for-good-first-movie-biggest-weakness-not-resolved/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wicked: For Good’s </a></em><a href=""https://www.slashfilm.com/2031892/wicked-for-good-first-movie-biggest-weakness-not-resolved/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">weaknesses</a> — its sincerity, optimistic politics, tidy resolutions, and feel-good messaging — are actually its strengths. </p>

<p>In a time when everyone’s a critic but no one’s an expert (an Amazon mic and a TikTok account do not a specialist make) and when standom has made it nearly impossible to share a dissenting opinion without heaps of hate, doxxing, and backlash, I’m never going to knock well-written, thoughtful criticism (even if I think some of these reviews are written by men who just don’t like musicals, or women emoting). But I can disagree. And I don’t think <em>Wicked: For Good</em> is a disappointment. It’s a pretty faithful adaptation of the second act of an ambitious musical that aims to please. The <a href=""https://people.com/wicked-for-good-movie-broadway-musical-differences-11852997"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">changes from the Broadway musical</a> to the big screen (like giving Glinda more depth and making <a href=""https://people.com/wicked-marissa-bode-teases-part-2-exclusive-8753054"">Nessarose’s arc less ableist</a>) absolutely work to make the narrative more cohesive, modern, and to deliver satisfying moments that make sure moviegoers get their money’s worth. </p>



<p>One of those moments is “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO8SiN8H6EQ"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">For Good</a>,” the musical number we’ve waited a whole year for. Erivo and Grande have gotten flack for their <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/movies/wicked-for-good-2-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">joint press interviews</a> that people perceive as codependent, cloying, and overly emotional. But once you see these two sing<em> “Who can say if I’ve been/ changed for the better/ But because I knew you/ I have been changed for good”</em> it starts to make sense. First of all, they are theater kids. Being overly emotional is their whole thing. Also, it’s refreshing to see two performers care so deeply about their work that they can’t help but cry about it. I’d take this energy over indifference any day. To hear <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HRhj5zRKN4"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Grande and Erivo tell it</a>, the parallels <a href=""https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a69474524/ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-friendship-timeline/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">between their friendship</a> and the one we see on screen are vast, and since they’ve been sitting with this material for years, they’ve developed a bond that formed long before they locked fingers in a junket while <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2024/11/26/wicked-ariana-grande-and-cynthia-erivos-holding-space-meme-explained/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">holding space for the lyrics of “Defying Gravity.</a>” And once you are sitting in the theater locked in on the culmination of Elphaba and Glinda’s saga, you’ll forget about the off-camera speculation and public perceptions and drift away to Oz to be serenaded by the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda The Good who have, against all odds, found their way back to each other. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11944468.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>L to R: Cynthia Erivo is Elphaba and Jonathan Bailey is Fiyero in WICKED FOR GOOD, directed by Jon M. Chu.</figcaption></figure>



<p>By the time we get to “For Good” in the film, Elphaba has been living in hiding attempting to expose the Wizard’s lies. She’s on a quest to free Oz’s animals who have been stripped of their voices and their rights. Her image (caricature posters depicting her with exaggerated features are so comically evil, they are reminiscent of <a href=""https://jimcrowmuseum.ferris.edu/coon/homepage.htm"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jim Crow-era, anti-Black imagery</a>) is projected all over Oz as a symbol of hate and villainy. Conversely, Glinda has everything she’s ever wanted — she’s risen to fame as a beloved symbol of Goodness — but still doesn’t have any magic of her own. With the help of Madame Morrible (a consistently uneven <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7436842946059570478"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Michelle Yeoh</a>), she’s keeping up illusions to maintain the Wizard’s tyrannical rule. Glinda is literally living in a bubble to upkeep the lies. She’s everything Elphaba warned her of becoming in “Defying Gravity.” Glinda is about to marry Fiyero (played perfectly by <a href=""https://people.com/jonathan-bailey-is-sexiest-man-alive-2025-11842000"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sexiest Man Alive, Jonathan Bailey</a>), now the captain of the Wizard’s guard, who hasn’t stopped his search for his real love, Elphaba. </p>



<p>It would be easy to read the dynamic between Elphaba, Fiyero and Glinda as just another literary love triangle, with two girls torn between a dashing prince, but as charming and <em>hot </em>as Fiyero is (I broke into a sweat during the chaste yet horny “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OdTKfYqBXY"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">As Long As You’re Mine</a>”), he’s really not that important. While it’s beautiful to see Elphaba find the romantic love she deserves, and the origin story of the Scaregrow is the strongest part of the <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2014/08/73723/wizard-of-oz-75-anniversary-pictures"">Wizard of Oz</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2014/08/73723/wizard-of-oz-75-anniversary-pictures""> </a>tie-in, Fiyero mainly exists as a test of Glinda and Elphaba’s friendship. On her wedding day, Glinda has to process the fact that her ex-best friend and her fiancé are about to run away together. The tables have turned and now, <em>she</em> is Not That Girl. Glinda has lived a privileged life as the popular girl, always chosen, always winning, and always sheltered from having to make any hard choices. She’s the girl who gets to walk down the aisle while Elphaba marches into the Wizard’s dungeon to free wrongfully imprisoned animals. (The gutting juxtaposition of these scenes, and how beautifully the sequence can be interpreted to show the paradox of white frivolity versus the responsibilities unfairly placed on marginalized people is why they can never make me hate Jon M. Chu.) Now, Glinda has not only lost her groom, but the bubble she so carefully constructed is also about to burst. Later, when Fiyero risks his life to save Elphaba by pointing a gun at Glinda’s face, you see her accept his love for Elphaba and her own. She calls his bluff, and resigns herself to the fact that they both love Elphaba. Of course they do. Grandé is heartbreakingly magnificent in this moment, playing Glinda’s conflict with painful awareness. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Ultimately, <em>Wicked</em> is about Elphaba and Glinda, two girls who grew together while figuring themselves out. It’s about the complexity, softness, and intensity  of platonic affection. </p><cite>kathleen newman-bremang</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>It’s clear that <em>Wicked: For Good</em>  is invested in Glinda’s redemption. She goes from self-serving mean girl to the arbiter of all things good. It’s fun to watch this transformation unfold, thanks in large part to Grande’s performance, but it’s also a fairytale without a happily ever after (I like her but I still think Glinda is a spineless, complicit, mediocre fraud who ain’t shit). We know in real life that opportunists rarely change their tune, that white women who turn their backs on their Black (ahem, green) counterparts for their own self interests do so callously and with gleeful disregard for their humanity. But in a world of talking Tin Men and cowardly lions, why can’t the fantasy include the moral salvation of the girl who “groveled in submission/ to feed [her] own ambition”? It’s a nice story, even though it comes at the expense of Elphaba’s freedom.</p>



<p>If I have one major critique of <em>Wicked: For Good, </em>it’s that I wanted more for my girl Elphaba. It’s hard to watch her fall on her sword as Glinda gets the glory. Dorothy is now in Oz, after allegedly murdering Nessarose by way of a falling house (we later learn it was Madame Morrible who did the deed, inspired by a Glinda suggestion). Elphaba decides that Oz needs a villain, a foe to Glinda’s hero, and offers herself up as the symbol they need to shun. She’s made this decision out of hurt and frustration — Fiyero is arrested and would have been beaten to death if Elphaba didn’t cast a spell turning his bones into straw — and is done doing good deeds with zero reward. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11944475.png?width=1024&amp;height=675&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A675"" /></figure>



<p>Many headlines about <em>Wicked: For Good</em> have <a href=""https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/wicked-for-good-review-give-ariana-grande-the-oscar-now/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">focused on Grande</a>, and while it’s true she is great in this sequel and that it’s more Glinda’s movie than Elphaba’s, Erivo is still firing on all cylinders, delivering a timeless performance that is also worthy of unadulterated praise. Throughout <em>Wicked: For Good, </em>Elphaba<em> </em>goes from fugitive freedom fighter, to heartbroken friend and exasperated sister, to frustrated revolutionary, to lover in mourning, to resigned martyr. It’s a depressing arc that sees the optimism of progressivism dashed with a big dose of witch-melting water. The simplicity of the message — that doing good comes at a cost, that no matter your intentions, things don’t always work in your favor, and that facism may take on a new face but it’s an ever-present threat — is the point. No one is fully good nor evil. In systems set up to oppress, the binary of good vs. evil is just another tool of the oppressor. While I don’t love the optics of a Black woman (we’ve established that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/11/11816225/cynthia-erivo-wicked-review-elphaba-black"">Elphaba is Black</a>) giving up her freedom and her reputation to save a white woman who betrayed her once and a population who vilified her, the lesson is about who you are when the choice is to do good without any benefit to yourself at all. How much goodness can you muster when it would be easier to be seduced by evil? Who are you in your darkest moments? What are your values, <em>really</em>?</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> Let’s take the <em>Wicked</em> movies for what they are instead of what you hoped the stage musical would be. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In Chang’s New Yorker review, he references <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2025/11/21/wicked-for-good-book-series-gregory-maguire/87378037007/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Gregory Maguire’s novel</a> the Broadway musical is loosely based on, which was an adaptation of Frank L. Baum’s children’s book, <em>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</em>: “Maguire’s novel was itself written in the spirit of a corrective; it aimed to bring a morally ambiguous modernism and a grownup, forthright sexuality to bear on Baum’s squeaky-clean demarcations of good and evil.” It’s true that <em>Wicked: For Good’s</em> political commentary may be clumsy at times and very much watered down from its source material (the characters are less overtly queer and some are literally whitewashed), but the musical still aims to take a stand against totalitarianism and teach audiences that a lying dictatorship uninterested in the truth and wielding power without checks and balances is bad, actually. And right now, I think that’s good, actually. </p>



<p>I understand the critiques, but let’s take the <em>Wicked</em> movies for what they are instead of what you hoped the stage musical would be. The movies were never going to be a radical reimagining of Maguire’s novel because that’s not what the musical is. It’s a big-hearted, campy, bold, funny, entertaining ride with a strong message. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11944477.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=429&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A429"" /><figcaption>L to R: Cynthia Erivo is Elphaba and Ariana Grande is Glinda in WICKED FOR GOOD, directed by Jon M. Chu.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Again, ultimately, <em>Wicked</em> is about Elphaba and Glinda, two girls who grew together while figuring themselves out. It’s about the complexity, softness, and intensity of platonic affection. It’s about how all-consuming female friendship can be in your youth. And it’s about the door (the <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/movies/cynthia-erivo-for-good-ad-lib-scene-wicked-rcna244955"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">“I love yous” were improvised, Erivo says</a>). There’s always been a chasm between the two witches — one is unusually and exceedingly peculiar and altogether quite impossible to describe, the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAvOfEweyJo"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">other is blonde</a> — and as they finally reach their farewell, the realization that they are better off because of their relationship hits, and it all coalesces in a gut wrenching declaration of mutual adoration, respect, and forgiveness. The fact that there is still a door between them in this moment, a physical divide between them as they grow into their most actualized selves, is exactly the ending these two characters should have, no matter how bittersweet. </p>



<p>It’s up for debate if Glinda and Elphaba ever see each other again, or if Glinda even knows her best friend is alive and wandering beyond the walls of Oz journeying to a new life with Fiyero (I think the answer is yes). In the <em>Wicked</em> cinematic universe, it’s also left unclear as to what kind of leader Glinda The Good becomes. In the absence of her evil overlords, does Glinda live up to the task Elphaba entrusts her with? Does she stay true to the final speech she gives to her fellow Ozians? Does she become who her best friend believed she could be? There’s hope in each of these questions. And when you look at it all through Elphaba’s eyes — the ones that saw the Good in Glinda before she did — it’s enough to move even the most cynical viewer. Even if you aren’t sobbing in the theater like I was, I promise if you open your heart, let go and embrace its earnestness, <em>Wicked: For Good </em>will change something in you for the better. </p>

<p>When it comes to beauty, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/is-korean-skincare-better-expert-advice"">Korea is in a league</a> of its own. Glass skin wasn’t created by accident; it’s all about careful, consistent care. But this meticulous approach isn’t limited to skincare — Korea is now bringing the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/kundal-korean-shampoo-hair-treatment-review"">same precision to haircare</a>. Forget miracle shampoos and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/rosemary-oil-hair-growth-benefits"">hair growth serums</a> for a second. This time, it’s treatments. Enter: hairline microblading.</p>



<p>Even if hairline microblading is completely new to you, I’m willing to bet you’ve at least heard of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/microblading-pigment-removal-trend""><em>brow</em> microblading</a>. You probably know someone who swears by it. The semi-permanent makeup treatment is famous worldwide for using tiny needles and natural-tone pigments to mimic fine brow hairs, essentially filling in sparse patches. Some microblading technicians can even create an entire brow from scratch. </p>

<p>Considering its ability to transform a face, it was only a matter of time before microblading made its way to the scalp. If Korea’s hair experts are anything to go by, it’s an excellent way to boost a thinning hairline quickly and effectively, outperforming tedious (and often questionable) hair growth serums.</p>



<p>Here’s everything you need to know about hairline microblading — and how to make it work for you.</p>



<h2>First of all, what causes a thinning hairline?</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.ukhairconsultants.com/eva-proudmans-clinics/"">Eva Proudman</a> FIT IAT, a leading consultant trichologist, says the hairline is the only place on our bodies that retains ‘baby’ or vellus hairs — essentially finer, wispier strands — so shedding there can appear more noticeable. A handful of factors can trigger hair shedding, also known as telogen effluvium. Think: hormonal shifts, stress, illness, weight loss, certain medications, and even high-tension hairstyles, like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/09/11521323/sofia-richie-sleek-bun-hair-style"">slicked-back buns or tight ponytails</a>. </p>



<h2>What is hairline microblading, and what are the benefits?</h2>



<p>Among professionals, hairline microblading is commonly referred to as scalp micropigmentation (SMP), says Proudman, who recommends it in the right circumstances. “It involves medical tattoos being applied to the scalp as small dots to give the illusion of follicles and hair.” Hairline microblading can be effective for certain types of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/drinking-matcha-hair-loss-thinning"">thinning and hair loss</a>, adds Proudman, and it’s often used to disguise small areas rather than provide full coverage — but not everyone is qualified to perform it.</p>



<p><a href=""https://karenbetts.com/"">Karen Betts</a>, an authority in permanent makeup treatments and founder of Karen Betts Clinics, says hairline microblading requires a highly experienced hand. “Brow hairs are shorter, coarser, and more structured, but hairline hairs around the temples grow more sparsely and lie flatter,” she explains. As such, hairline strokes need to be softer, more diffused, and carefully placed to blend seamlessly with existing hair, adds Betts. Thanks to ultra-fine needles, it’s now easier to replicate fine hairs with ink, but it’s still essential to choose a practitioner who’s properly qualified in scalp microblading. </p>

<h2>What are the risks or challenges associated with hairline microblading?</h2>



<p>If TikTok is anything to go by, hairline microblading might seem like a miracle solution for those experiencing thinning, but it’s not without its downsides. Firstly, your skin type matters. Betts explains that some people have thinner scalp skin than others, which requires a much lighter touch to avoid irritation or tattooing too deeply — again, why it’s important to go to someone qualified to work on the scalp and who knows their stuff. </p>



<p>If your scalp tends to be oilier, this can blur the pigment, adds Betts, making hair strokes appear unnatural and affecting how long they last. Then there’s the color choice and stroke direction, all of which matter for seamless, natural results. Betts adds that for clients with darker skin tones, there may not be enough contrast between the pigment and the skin to show fine detail. “In these cases, the effect will look more like shading rather than distinct hair strokes,” she says. </p>



<p>Proudman warns that, like brows, the hairline is very visible. “Getting something that is too heavy or obvious, or sits below the natural hairline, is simply not a good idea, and you may come to regret it,” she says. Ultimately, hairline microblading should be a collaborative process with your chosen artist. “If there’s any uncertainty about how the skin will take the pigment, it’s wise to do a test area first to see how the color holds,” says Betts. “Pigment may also fade unevenly if the strokes aren’t applied carefully,” she adds. Betts emphasizes the importance of choosing a qualified professional and says it’s all about patience and restraint, enhancing the hairline in a subtle way, rather than trying to completely transform it.</p>

<h2>How does hairline microblading compare to hair growth treatments like minoxidil?</h2>



<p>While hairline microblading is popping off on TikTok, Betts isn’t entirely sure the trend will stick around. But given its growing number of fans, she suspects it’ll fare better than some other semi-permanent tattoo trends: “Think blush, freckles, or lining eyeliner and lips with white shades,” she says. “I’ve tried all of those and they don’t age well.”</p>



<p>If microblading doesn’t sound like one for you, Proudman says there are a number of treatments for the hairline. First up: Minoxidil, also known as Rogaine, which is clinically proven to stimulate hair growth and slow hair loss. “Diet also matters,” adds Proudman. “Make sure yours is packed full of protein.” You might also want to consider supplements to correct nutrient deficiencies, says Proudman. Ask your doctor for bloodwork to see if you’re deficient.</p>



<h2>How long does hairline microblading last, and how much is it?</h2>



<p>Hairline microblading isn’t a one-and-done treatment; you might require a few sessions. While the results typically last anywhere between 12 to 18 months, Proudman suggests being prepared for maintenance: “This procedure isn’t permanent and will need care and attention,” says Proudman, including aftercare like keeping the scalp clean and moisturized, avoiding direct sun, and scheduling touch-ups throughout the years as the pigment fades. </p>



<p>Hairline microblading isn’t cheap. While the cost largely depends on the size of the area you want to treat, it can vary from clinic to clinic and, at the very least, is likely to start around $1,500. Top-ups will be cheaper.</p>

<h2>How else can you get your hairline back?</h2>



<p>Regardless of the treatment you choose, if your hairline is thinning, Proudman suggests getting a full, professional diagnosis from a trichologist or doctor first. “This will answer what condition you have. Is it stable or progressive? Can it be recovered? If so, to what extent?” asks Proudman. If the hairline isn’t stable or can be improved with treatments, she recommends waiting to see how things settle before opting for microblading. “In the end, this might not be necessary,” says Proudman, or worse, “it may become obvious once the hair grows in.” </p>



<p>At the end of the day, do your research thoroughly before opting for trending treatments like these — they may fade eventually, but you’ll be living with the results for a long while.</p>
