I started with attempting to investigate our <strong>willingness</strong>.</p><p>My research began to reveal that humans are generally willing to try AI experiences, and even more broadly — new technology — for a <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2022.101925"">combination of reasons</a>, including <strong>perceived usefulness, efficiency, enjoyment</strong>, and a natural human inclination to <strong>experiment with shiny new things</strong>.</p><p>To summarize, here are some of the key reasons and ideas I encountered as to why humans are more likely willing to try newer technologies, especially AI:</p><ul><li><strong>Novelty and curiosity: </strong>Humans are often drawn to new technologies and the potential they hold for progress and improvement.</li><li><strong>Social influence: </strong>Observing others adopting and benefiting from AI can encourage further exploration and acceptance.</li><li><strong>Efficiency and automation: </strong>AI can automate mundane and repetitive tasks, freeing up human time and energy for more complex or enjoyable activities.</li><li><strong>Enhanced capabilities: </strong>AI can perform tasks that humans find difficult or time-consuming, such as processing large datasets, identifying complex patterns, and generating new content.</li><li><strong>Improved experiences: </strong>AI can personalize interactions, provide targeted recommendations, and offer convenient, 24/7 support in areas like customer service and digital assistance.</li></ul><p>The concept of <strong>Social influence</strong> makes total sense to me — humans have historically relied on <strong>word-of-mouth</strong> to inform their decision making processes. AI is no different — we’re currently bombarded with personal stories from colleagues, friends and family of how they’re using AI.</p><p>Thinking about additional key concepts, <strong>efficiency</strong> and <strong>automation</strong> are the big promises of AI. And also where some of the fears stem from — <em>imagine seeing your skillsets automated leaving you effectively redundant</em>.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of the “summarize” feature now available within Google Docs"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QglxnrKk0V_Kre9fFncncA.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot of the “summarize” feature now available within Google Docs</figcaption></figure><p>Conceptually, both <strong>Enhanced Capabilities</strong> and <strong>Improved Experiences</strong> are showing up within existing software experiences more and more every day. Things like Google’s AI-enhanced search results or any of the “synthesis” capabilities being folded into nearly every product — <em>“help me write”</em> or <em>“summarize this”</em> types of patterns are quickly becoming commonplace.</p><p>What will be interesting across all of these is <strong>what sticks</strong>. I think many of us would agree we’re currently in a technological bubble. So out of these <strong>enhancements, improvements</strong> and <strong>novelties</strong> — <em>what will become consistently useful?</em></p><p>I believe surviving conversational experiences will continue to fall into either of the following categories. Some of these examples will be more like Latent Needs as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jmspool_driving-innovation-from-your-customers-activity-7363238346925481985-SQbB/"">Jared Spool</a> describes — akin to a heated steering wheel. In other words,</p><blockquote>“I didn’t know I needed this — but now that I have it…”</blockquote><p>Other example solutions will aim to solve existing problems facing human users. And the rest will become a casualty of the bubble as the <strong>novelty wears off</strong> and usefulness doesn’t persist.</p><p>At a high-level, it seems like it’s a suite of potential things that lead us to a place of willingness — <strong>the novelty of something new, the influence that both our peers and media have on us</strong> and of course — <strong>the promise of better</strong>.</p><h3>Acceptance</h3><p>I realize following a meandering path like this can be difficult — so I’ll try to keep us tethered. Remembering where I started at the beginning of this rabbit hole, I asked <em>why might we be willing to use an AI-driven conversational interface as compared to the classic Chatbots many of us distaste</em>. As I dug into the concept of willingness, I often encountered <strong>acceptance</strong> as a nearby, if not similar concept.</p><p>The primary distinction between acceptance and the previous one is that <strong>willingness is a short-term, initial mindset</strong>, while <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585322001587"">acceptance</a> describes the <strong>sustained, actual use of a product over time</strong>, reflecting <strong>deeper integration</strong> and <strong>satisfaction</strong>. So now that I understand the promise of the new a bit better, <em>what about this sustained relationship?</em></p><blockquote><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585322001587""><strong>Acceptance</strong></a> is primarily defined as the behavioral intention or willingness to use, buy, or try a good or service.</blockquote><p>It is a critical factor for the successful adoption and uptake of new technologies, particularly Artificial Intelligence. Low acceptance can lead to the <strong>disuse of resources, a surplus of unused devices</strong>, and a <strong>slowdown in technological innovation</strong>.</p><p>The research continued to portray how acceptance can be a conscious, personal choice, such as <strong>knowingly purchasing a device that contains AI</strong>, or it can also be an involuntary action, like <strong>unknowingly interacting with an AI chatbot</strong> that presents itself as a human customer service agent.</p><figure><img alt=""A swiss army style pocket knife — meant to highlight aspects of acceptance, such as perceived usefulness."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OMT3e9UHYHGDpiS0B1v_Jw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>image credit: Photo by<a href=""https://unsplash.com/@vjgalaxy?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash""> Alejandro Piñero Amerio</a> on<a href=""https://unsplash.com/photos/brown-and-silver-safety-pin-LHFuqK3KywE?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash""> Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>The <strong>key psychosocial factors </strong>that consistently predict a user’s acceptance of AI across various industries closely resembles willingness but with some variance towards perspective over time:</p><ul><li><strong>Perceived Usefulness / Performance Expectancy:</strong> This is the degree to which a person believes that using a particular technology will help them achieve their goals or be useful in their daily life. It is often the strongest positive predictor of the intention to use a new technology.</li><li><strong>Perceived Ease of Use / Effort Expectancy:</strong> This refers to a user’s perception of how effortless a technology would be to use. Its influence can be weaker than perceived usefulness, especially as users become more familiar with technology in general.</li><li><strong>Attitudes: </strong>A person’s attitude towards a technology is a frequently included variable that positively predicts their behavioral intention to use it.</li><li><strong>Trust:</strong> This is the subjective attitude that allows a person to make a vulnerable decision, believing that a technology will achieve a desired goal. You can really start to see some symbiosis here — <em>Trust in both the AI and its provider is a significant driving factor in acceptance</em>.</li><li><strong>Social Influence / Subjective Norms:</strong> This factor involves a person’s perception that significant others would approve or disapprove of their use of the technology. It is particularly relevant in industries with high levels of social contact.</li></ul><h4>Models for Assessing Acceptance</h4><p>To understand and measure acceptance, I came across several <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585322001587"">research-theoretical models</a>, and how they’ve been adapted specifically for contexts like AI.</p><ul><li><strong>Technology Acceptance Model</strong>: This is the most frequently used and flexible model for assessing technology acceptance. It posits that Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use are the primary drivers of a user’s intention to use a technology.</li><li><strong>Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology</strong>: This model integrates concepts from eight other theories, including TAM — Technology Acceptance Model. It suggests that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions predict behavioral intentions and usage.</li><li><strong>AI Device Use Acceptance model</strong>: A more recent model developed specifically for AI, the AIDUA model proposes that users appraise AI devices in stages based on factors like social influence, hedonic motivation (perceived pleasure), and anthropomorphism (human-like qualities).</li></ul><p>What I’ve found so far is that these psychological factors all seemingly overlap and interrelate. Willingness correlates to the novelty and promise of something new, while Acceptance speaks to how our expectations are met over time. I can start to see how these pieces fit together in perhaps a larger adoption journey.</p><blockquote>The perceived promise gets folks through the doors and consistent outcomes matching expectations keeps them coming back.</blockquote><p>Whew, here we are in the rabbit hole. I still feel like there’s more to understand about sustained use and what individual facets can help drive acceptance. <em>What is it that makes us hesitant instead of willing as the conversational space in software continues to evolve? What brings us back over and over again?</em></p><figure><img alt=""Modern depiction of Microsoft’s classic virtual assistant — Clippy"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pcYGzNmQglINPNRwxVgYBA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>image credit: Microsoft <a href=""https://news.microsoft.com/pt-br/aproveite-a-nostalgia-com-os-novos-planos-de-fundo-do-microsoft-teams/"">https://news.microsoft.com/pt-br/aproveite-a-nostalgia-com-os-novos-planos-de-fundo-do-microsoft-teams/</a></figcaption></figure><p>My curiosity led me in <strong>deeper</strong>. My hypothesis at this point was taking shape around this intersection of <strong>humans and how or why they might trust software</strong>. I’ve personally become distrustful of classic Chatbots. If it even looks like the Chatbot of yesterday — seeing something like a Floating Action Button yielding a Clippy-like offering, promising to answer all my questions — <em>I’m immediately prepared to never touch it</em>.</p><h3>Trust… actually Search first</h3><p>Before I head into why and how trust is earned and eroded, I started by investigating perhaps the precursor of today’s conversational experience — <strong>Search.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""A retro screenshot of Google’s homepage from circa 1998"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/502/1*zYMJwuoUOXS0ROQg6-cODw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Google Beta homepage (1998) Source: <a href=""https://www.india.com/buzz/happy-birthday-google-7-things-unheard-about-search-engine-giant-as-it-greets-self-with-doodle-on-16th-anniversary-159143"">India.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>Traditional search experiences are of course now being woven together with AI intelligence. Outside of that, you can still see and sense the same disparity in appreciation of search experiences akin to classic Chatbots and modern Conversational Experiences. Some search experiences are highly utilized and accepted and others are not. Putting allegiances aside, I was curious about how existing with Search as a paradigm and evolving with it all these years <strong>could have potentially influenced us</strong> as we are redirected into more conversational interfaces.</p><p>Through observations with some early conversational interfaces I’ve been working on, I noted that <strong>users are still mostly beginning their conversation with succinctly few words, if not only one word</strong> — <em>why?</em></p><p><a href=""https://www.emerald.com/ajim/article-abstract/73/3/436/50198/The-effects-of-cognitive-load-on-query?redirectedFrom=fulltext"">Research</a> revealed that users may start their searches with one word primarily due to the initial cognitive load and the iterative nature of search. I’d include familiarity as well, since search has been taking shape beside us for years now.</p><p>Explanations include:</p><ul><li><strong>Reducing cognitive load: </strong>Starting with a single term requires little effort. Users can quickly generate results and then adapt their query based on what they see.</li><li><strong>Iterative process: </strong>Search is often exploratory. A single keyword acts as a starting point, giving users something to refine as they go.</li><li><strong>System familiarity: </strong>Decades of exposure to search engines have trained users to trust that even minimal input will trigger auto-suggestions or relevant results.</li></ul><p>Interestingly, while iterative searching does happen, only <a href=""https://backlinko.com/google-user-behavior#only-15-of-google-users-modify-their-initial-search-term""><strong>15% of Google searches are refined or modified</strong></a>. This suggests to me that modern search engines are highly performant in that users often find satisfactory answers from their first attempt. Over time, this reliability has created a strong expectation that <em>“search just works,”</em> reinforcing user trust and shaping behavior.</p><blockquote>Subsequently, certain search experiences and approaches have evolved with us and adapted to us to become highly effective.</blockquote><p>In contrast — when currently working with an AI experience, users often <strong>feel as though they’re at fault for not achieving the outcome they’d hoped for</strong>. <em>“It’s my fault I can’t get this AI to do what I want!”</em> We should work to eliminate the returning concept of “User Error”.</p><p>This led me to some new questions:</p><ul><li><em>How does the trust that users have with traditional search transfer (or fail to transfer) to conversational AI?</em></li><li><em>What design patterns might we use to help conversational AI feel as reliable and effortless as traditional search?</em></li></ul><figure><img alt=""Human hand shaking a digital looking hand"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/958/1*nMkfMDMrNPMDzT2akbVo1A.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Image credit: Adobe Stock</figcaption></figure><h3>Back to Trust</h3><p>As seen with the evolution of Search — it took time to reach a point where users rely on the pattern, usually without question. I personally feel very confident currently that I can input very little into a Google Search and then with the predictive suggestions, presentation of results and likely summary-answers — <em>I’ll get what I’m looking for quickly and easily.</em></p><p>Unlike usability, which is <strong>immediately noticeable when something feels difficult or frustrating</strong>, <a href=""https://articles.ux-primer.com/how-ux-design-influences-the-way-users-trust-or-doubt-technology-28e6e8ca3596"">trust operates subtly</a> in the background.</p><blockquote>Trust is built in small moments of reassurance and consistency, and it can be lost in a single misstep.</blockquote><p>My journey across this research continued to affirm some things about trust. For example, in UX it isn’t just about security — it’s about <strong>predictability and transparency</strong>. Users trust products that behave in expected ways, where actions lead to anticipated outcomes. But trust doesn’t just matter at the beginning of an interaction; it needs to be <strong>reinforced throughout the user journey</strong>.</p><p>While the conceptual space surrounding how humans develop a trusting relationship with software experience is vast, here are a few notable concepts I can quickly summarize:</p><ul><li>One of the most powerful factors influencing trust is <a href=""https://www.psandman.com/col/familiarity.htm#:~:text=The%20basic%20principle%20in%20a,in%20which%20it%20is%20familiar).""><strong>familiarity bias</strong></a> — the tendency for people to trust what feels familiar.</li><li>Another key principle is <strong>cognitive fluency</strong>, which refers to how easily information is processed.</li><li><strong>First impressions</strong> also shape <a href=""https://articles.ux-primer.com/how-ux-design-influences-the-way-users-trust-or-doubt-technology-28e6e8ca3596"">long-term perceptions</a> of trustworthiness. Research in psychology shows that <strong>people form lasting opinions within milliseconds of encountering a website or app</strong>.</li></ul><blockquote>This is where our willingness is gambled away as our anticipated outcomes aren’t realized and we’re left disappointed.</blockquote><ul><li>Another psychological factor is <strong>ambiguity aversion</strong> — the <a href=""https://www.kommunicate.io/blog/ai-chatbot-fears/#:~:text=5.%20Companies%20Not%20Caring%20Another%20common%20concern,a%20cold%20and%20impersonal%20customer%20service%20experience."">natural discomfort people feel when outcomes are unclear</a>. If users aren’t sure what happens when they click a button, whether their payment went through, or how their data will be used, they experience hesitation. This seems like a facet of why many of us have grown negative towards traditional Chatbots — <em>I know personally I’m never sure how versatile or capable they might be.</em></li><li><a href=""https://articles.ux-primer.com/how-ux-design-influences-the-way-users-trust-or-doubt-technology-28e6e8ca3596""><strong>Emotional reassurance</strong></a><strong> </strong>also influences trust. Users feel more confident when an interface acknowledges their concerns, provides timely feedback, and offers clear pathways forward.</li><li><a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/how-is-trust-and-credibility-designed-in-ux-fc0ed84a1697""><strong>Social proof</strong></a> is a psychological phenomenon where people conform to the actions of others under the assumption that those actions are indicative of the correct behavior. In UX, social proof can be leveraged to enhance trust through elements like reviews, testimonials, or user counts. Antithesis of this is Dark Patterns. Interestingly, this seems to correlate back to Social Influence in how we might adopt and accept software.</li></ul><p>The answer to my initial question feels like its starting to take shape. Trust is clearly a big reason that some of us humans have become weary of traditional Chatbots and poor search experiences. We’ve been left stuck in ambiguity — <em>“are you able to actually answer my question?”</em> and then we’re subsequently and consistently disappointed with the quality of answer or help we sought.</p><figure><img alt=""A toy robot set in a dark background"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y4pTs1cuqsd0hICZlSTH9g.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=""https://unsplash.com/@jochenvw?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"">Jochen van Wylick</a> on <a href=""https://unsplash.com/photos/yellow-and-black-robot-toy-Y40Ga3oahAs?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Novelty, Risk &amp; Familiarity</h3><p>The research so far has shown how novelty can draw users to AI and new technological experiences. I found myself wondering if the <strong>relationship between novelty and willingness in this context were actually balanced</strong>. I quickly dug into how humans perceive risk around something new and novel to try and answer my new question.</p><p>According to my research, instead of a balance between novelty and willingness, <strong>the opposite is often true</strong>: <em>novelty can increase </em><a href=""https://www.psandman.com/col/familiarity.htm#:~:text=The%20basic%20principle%20in%20a,in%20which%20it%20is%20familiar).""><em>perceived risk and trigger risk-averse behavior</em></a>.</p><p>Here’s why:</p><ul><li><strong>Uncertainty and lack of information:</strong> Novelty inherently involves uncertainty, as the outcomes and potential risks of something new are not well-known or tested. This lack of information can be perceived as risky, prompting individuals to be cautious or avoid it altogether. This idea tends to be represented by a certain percentage of folks out there — still feeling hesitant or fearful of AI in general.</li><li><strong>Unfamiliarity:</strong> Humans tend to be more wary of the unknown. A lack of familiarity with something new can heighten feelings of vulnerability or potential harm, leading to risk aversion.</li><li><strong>Potential for negative consequences:</strong> Without prior experience, the potential for negative consequences with something new is often emphasized. Individuals tend to weigh potential losses more heavily than potential gains, making them more hesitant to engage with the unknown.</li><li><strong>Lack of fluency:</strong> Things that are difficult to process or are again, unfamiliar, can be perceived as less safe.</li></ul><p>All of this starts to feel like a razor’s edge of achieving sustained adoption. Initial novelty can undermine trust if expectations are unmet. Familiarity, through easy interfaces, builds trust, but repeated negative experiences (“familiarity betrayed”) destroy it, leading to disuse.</p><p>To build familiarity and reinforce trust, conversational interfaces must consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Novelty as an Entry Point:</strong> New AI experiences spark curiosity but risk disappointment if expectations aren’t met.</li><li><strong>Prioritize Clarity and Empathy:</strong> Design for <a href=""https://www.gladly.ai/blog/how-to-listen-to-customers-effectively/"">active listening</a>, clear communication, and acknowledgment of user frustration.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""An example screenshot where a Chatbot enabled human handoff"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/420/1*KgY4H3otVIVDM00XjkMp9g.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Image credit: <a href=""https://www.gptbots.ai/blog/chat-bot-to-human-handoff"">https://www.gptbots.ai/blog/chat-bot-to-human-handoff</a></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Continuously Improve and Manage Expectations:</strong> Regularly update AI performance and set realistic expectations for its capabilities. This might be obvious — but if we knew ahead of time that the experience we were about to engage in was limited in certain ways, we might not result in such disappointment.</li></ul><h3>Summary</h3><p>This research journey has revealed much and of course, left me with even more questions and tangents to continue exploring. <em>(Feel free to check out my collection of resources in this </em><a href=""https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/05bf5d9e-964f-4fb8-b419-ac31abfaac4f""><em>Google Notebook LM</em></a><em>)</em></p><p>However, I think the answer to my original question, <em>Why are we willing to try and use new AI experiences while many of us hold disdain for the previous era of less intelligent Chatbots</em> is this =</p><ul><li>Novelty and the promise of new and better has <strong>enthralled many of us to dispel our own aversions and give emerging AI experiences a shot</strong>.</li><li>The social influence and word of mouth surrounding us at work, in the media, amongst friends and family has reassured <strong>more of us that the risk is worth it</strong>.</li><li>The successful examples we experience and hear about help to contrast the earlier iterations of conversational experiences —<strong> these are not Chatbots</strong>.</li></ul><blockquote>As we all collectively move beyond novelty and into familiarity - our consistently successful experiences that match our expectations will yield trust, leaving us accepting the few remaining products that deliver on all fronts.</blockquote><h3>Next</h3><p>One thing stood out across all this research — is the idea that effective communication practices can foster trust and acceptance. What a beautiful idea that every-day communication skills like Active Listening, Empathy, Clarity and Transparency all will likely embolden trust and drive adoption.

It’s on </em></strong><a href=""https://www.fadedpage.com/sc/innis.php""><strong><em>Harold Innis</em></strong></a><em> and how his forgotten idea about media bias can help us understand why search has become a negotiation for truth.</em></p><h3>How delivery shapes belief</h3><p>In the mid-1900s, Harold Innis was studying why some forms of knowledge last a long time and others disappear quickly. His answer: <a href=""https://www.newcartographies.com/p/harold-innis-and-our-time"">the way information is delivered carries a bias.</a></p><p>What he called <a href=""https://www.media-studies.ca/articles/innis.htm"">media bias</a> wasn’t what you would think of as being political. Instead, this was structural. Every medium (or delivery method) tilts truth in a particular direction. Innis divided this communication into two types:</p><ul><li><strong>Time-biased media</strong> like stone tablets, clay, and oral tradition: durable, slow to produce, hard to distribute. Designed to preserve memory across generations. <br />They were costly to create, so what made it into stone was meant to last.</li><li><strong>Space-biased media</strong> like paper, newspapers and radio: fast, scalable, and easy to spread. Great for moving information across distance. The tradeoff is that the information is easy to forget.</li></ul><p>Each method has different consequences if you’re wrong. You definitely don’t want to carve a mistake in stone. But you’ll toss an opinion on the radio without much hesitation.</p><p>Innis believed civilizations leans one way or the other. The problem is when they lean too far, things start to crack. For instance, the more a culture chases speed, the more it sacrifices memory.</p><p>That worried him, because when speed becomes the goal, friction disappears. And when friction disappears, belief forms too easily.</p><p>When that happens, people start believing things without remembering why. Information flies everywhere, and everyone believes a little bit of everything, but nothing deeply enough to sustain conviction, trust, or memory.</p><p>Which brings us to the delivery method shaping a lot of decisions today: the <strong>answer engine</strong>.</p><h3>The frictionless answer</h3><p>Innis taught that every medium tilts truth by setting the cost of being wrong (back to the idea that stone carried a level of permanence).</p><p><strong>Answer engines flipped that equation.</strong> They’re fast, free, available and project absolute confidence… while carrying almost zero accountability.</p><p>That’s the bias of the delivery system we live with now: <strong>it produces answers that <em>look </em>like truth but are endlessly changeable.</strong></p><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>That mismatch matters. It’s not just a technology problem, and it’s deeply philosophical.</p><h3>Truth as a system</h3><p>Truth has always carried signals about how seriously to take it. I think about how headlines hint at urgency or a broadcast voice carries authority. Even a blog post tells you something about the author behind it.</p><p>Answer engines strip that information away. What’s left is a paragraph that’s floating above information that is constantly shifting around.</p><p>That’s why I think <strong>negotiation</strong> is the right metaphor. We aren’t testing competing claims anymore. We’re reacting to how the system delivers them. If it looks fine, we believe it.</p><p>Innis understood that the way information is delivered is more important than the content. It sets the probability of belief.</p><p>When answers are this easy to generate, its the delivery method that convinces us, not the accuracy of the information. Over time, we stop asking whether something is true and start assuming it must be… because it looked complete when it showed up.</p><h3>The context problem</h3><p>So we arrive at the issue brands are <em>actually</em> facing.</p><p>Brands assume the challenge is volume. Publish more, post more… rank more. But the challenge isn’t content. <strong>It’s context.</strong></p><p>Most brands are still playing an old game… chasing backlinks, tweaking keywords, and pumping out pages to satisfy algorithms that ranked links instead of resolving questions.</p><p>That used to work… when brands controlled the narrative. When it paid to write carefully sanitized copy that sounded official, without saying anything useful. When brands do that now, they don’t look like they’re being careful. They look evasive.</p><p>But now that same content gets torn apart, summarized, and served out of context.</p><p>This is an answer-first world. You can be right and still not be trusted.</p><p>That’s another paradox: <strong>trust now lives even further downstream from your content. It’s perceived by the reader only after they’ve read what the answer engine tore apart.</strong></p><h3>What we build from here</h3><p>If search is now a negotiation, brands can’t keep showing up the old way.</p><p>Publishing more just to publish more doesn’t make brands more believable. (You can look at stats on your content if you don’t believe me.)</p><p>Instead, I think brands need to work on understanding customer friction, offering context, and helping people weigh what to believe… even when the answer isn’t perfect. <strong>That’s how you build trust with your customer.</strong></p><p>Take financial services (where I spend my time).</p><p>Most banks write content to align with their own products and services. But answer engines aren’t asking what helps the brand. They’re asking what helps the reader.</p><p>So if you’re writing a piece called “What should Gen Z do with their tax return?”, and every answer just funnels them toward your checking account, you’ve already lost. Not because your product is bad… but because your answer wasn’t complete.</p><p>I think this will be the difference.

<h4>Design management is harder (and better) than I thought</h4><figure><img alt=""A hand-drawn diagram of x’s and o’s with lines and arrows pointing out various movements."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wFclA7SgV_V8vIyc0aH4fQ.png"" /></figure><p>I’ve been a design manager since 2022. Like many others in this role, I’ve been slowly shaping and reshaping my management values. This is where I’m at now. I’ll likely update this over time, or do a part 2.</p><p>I was an individual contributor (IC) for over 20 years before moving into management. Even then, I was reluctant to take the job because I enjoyed doing the work so much. So I’m familiar with ICs, how they think, and what sorts of things they think about. Things like craft, product quality, three-month timelines, career development, and recognition.</p><p>Now that I’ve been in management for a while, I also see how leadership thinks too. They’re thinking about strategy, year-long roadmaps, revenue, and the overall health of the organization.</p><p>I have a foot in both worlds, which will be a common thread in this article. I can help ICs think a little more strategically, and I can help leaders stay closer to the work.</p><p>Whether or not “manager” is in my title, I try to be that bridge, and to help everyone around me get just a little bit better.</p><h3>It all starts with team health</h3><p>No one does their best work when they’re stressed, burned out, or afraid to speak up. Great collaboration comes from trust and honest feedback that never feels personal or belittling.</p><p>I try to build that culture:</p><ul><li>Giving people both async and live ways to contribute, so it’s not just the loudest voice or one in an optimal timezone that wins.</li><li>Making it normal to share work early, not just when someone “feels it’s ready for critique.” We’re going to get leadership’s feedback at some point, better to get it early when there’s still time to address it and possibly change direction.</li><li>Being realistic about bandwidth and not overcommitting folks. I sometimes have to talk someone out of saying “yes” to something when they don’t realistically have time for it.</li><li>Encouraging experimentation and making room for failure as folks drift into adjacent roles. Especially now as research, design, product, and engineering move closer together.</li><li>Being vulnerable myself: sharing a past failure with the team, saying “I don’t know the answer”, or admitting when I’m struggling.</li></ul><p>With a healthy team culture, everything else gets easier.</p><h3>Player coach</h3><p>Some managers are comfortable not doing design anymore. Not me. I prefer being a player-coach, coaching the team and still doing some actual design work myself.</p><p>Most of the leaders I respect are close to the craft. Especially now, when AI enables everyone to build more, there’s less room for people who don’t actually do the work. I spend about equal time between people problems and craft problems.</p><p>I need real knowledge of the craft to be a useful thought partner. If I drift too far from the work, I stop speaking the same language as my ICs. I miss the little details that matter. Without that context, my input feels generic and surface-level.</p><p>Being good at the people side helps me move projects forward by unblocking decisions, aligning folks around a goal, and building momentum.</p><p>Getting better at the craft makes meme better at the work itself. The product experience, along with its complexity and details. The thing customers actually experience.</p><p><strong>You need both to lead well.</strong></p><p>That said, I’m mindful not to take on any large or “critical path” projects. My design contributions usually involve things like designing small features, covering a project when a designer is on PTO, bug fixes and polish, taking “busy work” from my ICs, and starting larger vision work to hand off to someone else.</p><p>This keeps me hands-on, but not in the way. That balance is important for me. That balance is important for me.</p><h3>Delegation is a sliding scale</h3><p>Delegation is often treated like a light switch. You either do the work yourself or you hand it off completely. In reality, it’s more of a sliding scale.</p><p>Sometimes you take on the task yourself. Sometimes you work alongside someone. Other times, you let them run with it. The right approach depends on the situation, their experience, and how much I want to check in along the way.</p><p>For example, I stay involved in the day-to-day of important projects. For smaller ones, I might delegate fully and just say, “Let me know how it turns out” or “Holler if you need anything from me.”</p><p>It’s less about rules and more about knowing my team.</p><h3>Avoid becoming a bottleneck</h3><blockquote><em>You may be lying to yourself when you say, “I’m the only one who can do this”. — </em><a href=""https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/how-to-delegate-with-high-standards""><em>Wes Kao</em></a></blockquote><p>Wes’s quote stuck with me because I’ve caught myself doing exactly that. In the past, I’ve been guilty of “hiding” in the work I’m already good at, keeping it from others. I tell myself no one else can do X, but deep down it’s also pride in being the one who does it well.</p><p>It’s important to be honest and call myself out in situations like this.</p><p>There are going to be new things that are ambiguous and uncertain, and it’s going to feel tempting to delay thinking about those and focusing on what I know. There will always be too much on my plate. The job is to decide where I’ll have the most impact, usually not by falling back on what I’m already good at. That might mean passing on a design review I’d normally jump into so I can focus on a hiring decision instead.</p><p>An example is HTML email: Every job I’ve had in the last 10 years, I’ve been known as “the email guy” who knows how to code HTML emails. That may be true when I first join, but I make sure to document what I know so others can help themselves. As an example, I created an email design system during my time at Stack Overflow so each product team could build their own emails without being email experts.</p><p>Another example is design feedback. I can’t review everything in real-time, and I don’t want that to slow my team down. So I documented what I look for: my taste, established UX conventions, our design system, and the comments I repeat most often, and made a custom GPT for my team to use. I even added some of my boss’s feedback style.</p><p>The goal isn’t always to <em>replace</em> me, but to help my team go farther without me.</p><h3>Clearing the path</h3><p>A big part of my job is helping my team <a href=""https://jordivillar.com/blog/becoming-irrelevant"">focus</a> on the work that matters most. That means filtering out noise before it ever reaches them. Not every request deserves their attention. I’d rather say no early than let distractions pile up. Pushing back is not always comfortable, but protecting the team’s focus is part of my role.</p><p>I also spend time clearing fog. Ambiguity slows people down. By sharpening the problem, setting constraints, or filling in missing context, I can help the team move faster and make better decisions.</p><p>And then there’s tension. Between what leadership wants, what the team needs, and what the product should become. I absorb that tension so my team doesn’t have to. That might mean telling leadership we need to slow down, or explaining to the team why priorities just shifted.</p><p>The team gets the clarity. I carry the weight.</p><h3>Just enough process</h3><p>Process helps teams stay on track, but too much of it kills creativity and momentum. When checkpoints and approvals pile up, the work starts to feel like factory output. I’ve seen projects where the design review process added more overhead than the design itself. No bueno.</p><p>My goal is to have enough structure to guide the work, but allows detours along the way for folks to find the right solution. Like prototyping an unexpected idea.</p><p>I teach designers to use their own judgment so they need me less for permission and more for refinement. Figma’s Jonas Downey has <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/how-to-build-a-resilient-design-team/#_5-be-judicious-about-process"">a few great prompts</a> to get designers thinking:</p><ul><li>What would you decide if it was fully up to you?</li><li>How would you explain this to a user?</li><li>How does it support our business?</li><li>How could we simplify it?</li></ul><p>I love using these in design reviews to get the discussion going when the group is quiet, and they always spark better conversations than another checklist would. These nudge people toward clearer, stronger work without adding more process.</p><h3>The manager’s quiet kind of high</h3><p>I’ve made peace with not getting that <a href=""https://jamie.ideasasylum.com/2024/06/21/the-manager-s-unbearable-lack-of-endorphins"">daily high</a> from making something with my own hands. I get satisfaction from watching my team build great stuff and grow personally, and knowing I played a part in it.</p><p>There’s power in those indirect wins:</p><ul><li>Clearing the path so someone can ship something they’re proud of.</li><li>Coaching someone today so their work months from now is stronger.</li><li>Rejecting the urgent-but-low-impact so the team can focus on what matters.</li></ul><p>Like when a designer nails their review with leadership, a coworker compliments one of my reports, or our work moves an important metric.</p><p>These moments aren’t always loud or concrete, so I keep a section for them in <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/why-you-should-have-a-brag-document-eb6cc82ec80a"">my brag document</a> so I don’t forget about my wins as a manager.</p><h3>Don’t forget who you are</h3><p>Design work is tough, even in the best conditions. As a manager, one of the things I enjoy most is finding ways to take pressure off the team when things get especially stressful.</p><p>I still upload unhinged custom emojis to company chat, host silly birthday games over Zoom, and drop funny links in chat.</p><p>[cowboy emojis: Cowboy emojis, a tradition started by <a href=""https://www.aaronshekey.com/posts/custom-emojis/"">a former co-worker</a>.]</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m mindful of what I say publicly because I realize the weight my words and actions carry as a leader in the company. But it’s important to lighten the mood once in a while That spirit finds its way back into the work and helps people feel psychologically safe.</p><h3>Everyday is winding road</h3><p>Like I said earlier, I’m still learning and my thoughts are evolving. I’m not a seasoned pro, but after a few years in management I’ve learned a few things worth sharing. I’m pressing publish now… curious to see how this will read a year from today.</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p><p><a href=""https://www.tedgoas.com/newsletter/""><em>Subscribe to my newsletter</em></a><em> to get more bit-sized thoughts on product design, email, and climate tech.</em></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=7c998c017602"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/management-values-i-didnt-expect-to-learn-7c998c017602"">Management values I didn’t expect to learn</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

He collaborated with business leaders every step of the way.</p><p>Jacek is now an art director for the Bonnier Business Press, overseeing papers in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states, and the work he oversees consistently wins major prizes (including another SND world’s-best in 2007 for Estonia’s <em>Äripäev</em>), despite their small teams and limited resources.</p><figure><img alt=""Jacek Utko quote: Design can change everything in your company; it can turn your company upside down.

<h4>The future of work in the age of AI and deepware.</h4><p>There is a photograph from 1930s East London that should be mandatory viewing for anyone anxious about AI taking their job. It shows Mary Smith, a “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knocker-up"">knocker-up</a>” — <strong>a woman whose entire profession consisted of walking the streets at dawn, shooting dried peas at bedroom windows with a long bamboo pole to wake workers for their factory shifts.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Photograph from 1930s showing Mary Smith, a “knocker-up,” wielding a bamboo pole with dried peas, shooting them at bedroom windows to wake factory workers."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*rkCJ0XioJKqdRXNE.jpg"" /><figcaption>Mary Smith, a “knocker-up” in East London (1930s)</figcaption></figure><p>Mary charged sixpence a week for this service. Then the alarm clock arrived, and Mary’s job vanished.</p><p>Do we mourn the knocker-up today? Do we rage against the tyranny of the alarm clock? Of course not. Because what happened to Mary is what has happened throughout every technological revolution: certain tasks became obsolete whilst entirely new categories of work emerged.</p><p>Yet here we are in 2025, gripped by the same ancient panic. <em>AI is coming for our jobs</em>, we are told. The robots will replace us. The future is bleak.</p><blockquote>Let me offer a different provocation: AI is not coming for your job. It is coming for your tasks. And if you cannot distinguish between the two, then yes — you should be worried.</blockquote><h3>The evolution we refuse to see</h3><p>Human work has always been in flux. In nomadic societies, we hunted and gathered. Agriculture tethered us to land and rhythms of seasons. Industrialisation moved us into factories, trading physical labour for wages. The information age shifted us again — this time from brawn to brain, from making things to managing data, information, and knowledge.</p><p>Each transition has redefined not just what we do, but what remains uniquely human about work. We moved from physical exertion to cognitive processing. Now we have built what I call “<a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/when-deepware-meets-wetware-the-uncomfortable-truth-about-responsible-ai-245842121749""><em>deepware</em></a>” — neural networks and machine learning systems layered atop our traditional software and hardware. <br />These architectures can process, pattern-match, and produce at speeds we cannot fathom. Yet in our rush to innovate, we have convinced ourselves that <em>deepware</em> can carry the weight of responsibility our <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetware_(brain)""><em>wetware</em></a> — our human brains and nervous systems — seems increasingly willing to surrender. We are moving again, but this time the question is whether we are moving forward or simply moving away.<br />Because this time, the shift is not from physical to mental. It is from execution to <strong><em>responsibility</em></strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""A horizontal timeline infographic titled “The Evolution of Human Work.” It shows five large coloured circles connected by a black arrow, each representing a stage of labor. Nomadic (Hunting): “Physical survival, hunt and gather.” Agricultural (Farming): “Tied to land and seasonal cycles.” Industrial (Factories): “From muscle to machine labour.” Information (Knowledge): “Brains over brawn: data and knowledge.” Deepware (Responsibility): “Execution shifts to responsibility and ethics.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ImgkXpy6k2_U53LUT5K7XQ.png"" /><figcaption>The evolution of work, from hunting to responsibility.</figcaption></figure><p>As <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Narayanan"">Arvind Narayanan</a> at Princeton observes, jobs are not monolithic entities. They are bundles of tasks. Some tasks are routine and susceptible to automation. Others require distinctly human qualities: judgement, ethics, accountability, wisdom.</p><p>The question is not whether AI can perform tasks. It demonstrably can, often better than we can. The question is who takes responsibility when those tasks produce consequences in the real world.</p><h3>Outputs are not outcomes</h3><p>This distinction matters more than most organisations realise.</p><p><strong>Output</strong> is what a process produces. Code. Copy. Designs. Legal briefs. Medical recommendations. Outputs are the tangible results of a system executing its programmed or prescribed function — the direct product of following steps, rules, or algorithms. The term emerged in the industrial era, literally describing the quantity of coal or iron a mine could extract in a given period. Output depends entirely on the efficiency and capability of the process that generates it.</p><p><strong>Outcome</strong> is what happens when that output meets reality. An outcome requires context, interpretation, application, and crucially — <em>intentionality</em>. Outcomes demand understanding not just what was produced, but why it matters, who it affects, and what consequences ripple from it. Where outputs measure productivity, outcomes measure impact. They are the ultimate change or consequence that results from applying an output with purpose and judgment.<br />AI can generate outputs. It cannot, however, create outcomes. Because outcomes require something <em>deepware</em> fundamentally lacks: the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetware_(brain)""><em>wetware</em></a> capacity for responsibility.</p><p>Computers cannot be held accountable, as IBM recognised in 1979. That truth has not changed. What has changed is our willingness to pretend otherwise.</p><figure><img alt=""IBM’s note stating: A computer can never be held accountable. Therefore a computer must never make a management decision."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*KxrF3PVHDs2TbLRh.png"" /><figcaption>IBM note, 1979</figcaption></figure><h3>The accountability vacuum</h3><p>We have already seen the cost of this pretension. A <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/06/03/attorneys-court-ai-hallucinations-judges/"">lawyer</a> in the US submitted AI-generated briefs filled with fabricated cases. A trial in <a href=""https://www.usnews.com/news/offbeat/articles/2025-08-15/australian-lawyer-apologizes-for-ai-generated-errors-in-murder-case"">Australia</a> was delayed because no one verified the AI’s outputs. These were not technological failures — these were failures of human responsibility.</p><p>When a professional says “the AI recommended it,” they are engaging in the same moral abdication as someone saying “I was just following orders.” Both statements attempt to transfer accountability to something — or someone — <a href=""https://emerge.digital/resources/ai-accountability-whos-responsible-when-ai-goes-wrong/"">incapable</a> of bearing it.</p><p>This is the dangerous seduction of <em>deepware</em>: it offers us the illusion that we can delegate not just tasks, but responsibility itself.</p><p>We cannot. We must not.</p><p>The future of work, then, is not about humans competing with AI for task execution. It is about humans stepping into roles where we exercise oversight, judgement, and accountability over the outputs that AI produces. This is not replacement. This is elevation.</p><p>But only if we prepare for it.</p><h3>The skills <em>deepware</em> cannot replicate</h3><p>Here is what the regulations already understand, even if organisations do not: responsible AI demands responsible humans. <br />The <a href=""https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai"">EU AI Act </a>mandates human oversight, transparency in decision-making, and clear accountability chains. Not as bureaucratic burden, but as fundamental safeguard.</p><p>Because here is the uncomfortable truth about <em>deepware</em>: it learns from historical data, which means it perpetuates historical biases.</p><p><a href=""https://www.cangrade.com/blog/hr-strategy/hiring-bias-gone-wrong-amazon-recruiting-case-study/"">Amazon’s</a> recruitment algorithm discriminated against women. <a href=""https://fairnow.ai/workday-lawsuit-resume-screening/"">Workday’s</a> hiring system did the same with 40+ candidates. <a href=""https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/even-a-small-typo-can-throw-off-ai-medical-advice-mit-study-says"">MIT</a> research found that AI healthcare systems told female patients they were more likely to “manage illness at home”. <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/search/can-you-review-this-article-an-G_Tc8IpkTOyF.Bj47m8IfQ"">Judicial</a> algorithms found Black defendants more culpable.</p><p>These are not glitches. These are features of systems trained on data that encoded decades of invisible discrimination.</p><p>So when we talk about the future of work, we are really talking about the future capacity of humans to think critically about the machines we build. To question their outputs. To interrogate their processes. To identify bias. To imagine consequences. To demand better.</p><p>This requires a different skill set entirely:</p><p><strong>Critical thinking: </strong>the ability to evaluate claims, identify assumptions, and distinguish correlation from causation.</p><p><strong>Systems thinking: </strong>understanding how components interact, how changes ripple, how second and third-order effects emerge.</p><p><strong>Lateral thinking: </strong>seeing connections across domains, applying insights from one context to another.</p><p><strong>Scenario planning: </strong>running mental simulations of possible futures, stress-testing decisions before implementation.</p><p><strong>Consequence thinking: </strong>asking not just “can we?” but “should we?” and “then what?”</p><p>Notice what these skills have in common. They are uniquely human. They require <em>wetware</em> that is fully engaged, not atrophied from disuse.</p><h3>The extension that could replace us</h3><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan"">Marshall McLuhan</a> wrote in 1967 that <em>“all technologies are extensions of our physical and nervous systems to increase power and speed.</em>” <br />The wheel extended our legs. The telescope extended our eyes. Now <em>deepware</em> extends our cognitive capacity.</p><p>But here is McLuhan’s warning, implicit in every page: when an extension becomes too powerful, we risk forgetting the limb it was meant to serve. We outsource function, and eventually, capability atrophies.</p><p>Consider the calculator. Brilliant tool. But an entire generation now cannot perform basic arithmetic without one. The extension has replaced the skill.</p><p>Now scale that to <em>deepware</em>. If we allow AI to think for us — to analyse, to recommend, to decide — without maintaining our own capacity to audit and override, we risk something far more dangerous than job loss. We risk becoming obsolete not because machines replaced us, but because we voluntarily stepped aside.</p><h3>The choice that defines the next era</h3><p>The future of work is not a future without humans. It is a future where humans do fundamentally different work: the <strong><em>work of being responsible</em></strong>.</p><p>This means verification before deployment. Critical thinking over speed. Systems thinking over isolated innovation. Accountability at every level.</p><p>It means training a generation not just to prompt AI, but to <em>interrogate</em> it. Not just to deploy models, but to <em>govern</em> them. Not just to consume outputs, but to construct meaningful <em>outcomes</em>.</p><p>It means recognising that as our <em>deepware</em> grows more sophisticated, our <em>wetware</em> must grow more rigorous. Every layer of AI we add demands an exponential increase in human oversight.</p><p>This is not optional. This is existential.</p><p>Mary Smith lost her job when the alarm clock arrived. But she did not lose her capacity for work — she adapted. Her children worked in offices, not on streets. Her grandchildren worked in roles she could never have imagined.</p><p>The same will be true for us, but only if we make a conscious choice: to remain conscious. To refuse the abdication of responsibility that <em>deepware</em> makes so seductively easy. To recognise that outcomes require human judgement in ways that outputs never will.</p><p>Our <em>wetware</em> remains the most sophisticated technology we possess. In the age of <em>deepware</em>, it is also the only thing preventing a future where machines own not just our code, but our agency.</p><p>The next time someone shows you what AI can do, we need to ask them something more important: who is responsible when it goes wrong?</p><p>Because in the end, the future of work depends not on what machines can produce, but on whether humans remember that we, and only we, can be held accountable for what happens next.</p><p><em>For a deeper exploration of the deepware-wetware framework and why responsible AI fundamentally depends on active human cognition, read: </em><a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/when-deepware-meets-wetware-the-uncomfortable-truth-about-responsible-ai-245842121749""><em>When Deepware meets Wetware: the uncomfortable truth about responsible AI</em></a></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a9293109b3be"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/when-machines-make-outputs-humans-must-own-outcomes-a9293109b3be"">When machines make outputs, humans must own outcomes</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Here’s What They’re Building Next in Puerto Rico,"Bad Bunny & Amazon’s “Una Más” Live-Stream Was The Start. Here’s What They’re Building Next in Puerto Rico

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936939.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>It’s been two weeks since <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-super-bowl-maga-backlash"">Bad Bunny</a> teamed up with <a href=""https://music.amazon.com/"">Amazon Music</a> for <a href=""https://music.amazon.com/live/events/L0ZYE8MCOT"">“No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí: Una Más,”</a> a special encore concert added to his 30-show, sold-out <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-no-me-quiero-ir-de-aqui-residency-outfits"">residency in Puerto Rico</a>. The event took place on September 20 — the anniversary of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/09/209761/hurricane-maria-anniversary-puerto-rico-women-experience"">Hurricane María</a> — and was live-streamed globally via the Amazon Music app, Prime Video, and Twitch. With countless fans tuning in from around the world, the broadcast broke records, becoming the most-watched single-artist performance in Amazon Music’s history and drawing more than 340,000 live viewers on Twitch alone.</p>



<p>But that concert was just the beginning of a much larger collaboration. Bad Bunny’s 31st performance marked the launch of a long-term partnership between Amazon and the Puerto Rican artist that aims to invest in his homeland through initiatives centered on education, disaster relief, and cultural empowerment.</p>



<p>“It was always intentional,” Rocío Guerrero, Director of Music, Latin-Iberia at Amazon Music, tells Refinery29 Somos. “That everyone all over the world could go to Benito’s house, from their houses. The intention was to bring attention to Puerto Rico: the culture, the history, the resilience, and all of the different things we saw during that live-stream.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“The intention was to bring attention to Puerto Rico: the culture, the history, the resilience, and all of the different things we saw during that live-stream.”</p><cite>Rocío Guerrero</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Stepping into Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio’s “casita” meant a virtual journey into Puerto Rico itself — visually and emotionally transporting viewers to the archipelago that has shaped much of Bad Bunny’s artistry. Guerrero says that was the central goal from the start: to use the platform not only to entertain but to redirect global attention toward Puerto Rico and its people.</p>



<p>“From the very beginning, when we met with [Bad Bunny’s team], it was always all about Puerto Rico, from both ends,” she adds. “For us, as Amazon, we’re trying to help and support communities, not just artists. And for Benito, he didn’t want to make this about himself. They were very clear about this. They wanted this to be about Puerto Rico.”</p>



<p>The multi-year collaboration between Bad Bunny and Amazon is structured around three main pillars that the artist and his team prioritized: education and technology, agriculture, and economic development. Together, Amazon, Fundación Rimas (founded by Bad Bunny’s management team), and <a href=""https://www.goodbunnyfoundation.org/"">Fundación Good Bunny</a> (the artist’s nonprofit) are developing new programs both on the island and online.</p>



<p>The first phase focuses on education. The partnership will fund the creation of STEM education centers across Puerto Rico, where teachers and students will have access to training, courses, and tools like Amazon Fire tablets. In times of natural disaster, these centers will also serve as public shelters, an intentional tie to the anniversary of Hurricane María, which devastated the archipelago in 2017.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“From the very beginning, when we met with [Bad Bunny’s team], it was always all about Puerto Rico, from both ends.”</p><cite>Rocío Guerrero</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, through <em>comPRa Local</em> — a soon-to-launch, curated storefront on Amazon.com — global consumers will be able to directly support Puerto Rican artisans, brands, and businesses. The store will highlight locally made food, products, music, books, and everyday goods, all marked with a new “Hecho en PR” badge that distinguishes items produced on the archipelago.</p>



<p>Additionally, Amazon is working with its partners to leverage its logistics infrastructure to support local farmers and improve access to fresh produce across the archipelago, where agricultural systems are fragile.</p>



<p>“So we are bringing together music, customers, and commerce into one place, and the tangible impact is the more people buying this store, the better the economy for Puerto Rican vendors,” Guerrero says. </p>



<p>According to Guerrero, these efforts represent just the beginning — not only of what’s to come from the multi-year collaboration with Bad Bunny but also of a broader strategy for how Amazon Music plans to collaborate with artists moving forward.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Our mission from the beginning, at least since I’ve come in, has been elevating Latin music, showcasing the different genres from the communities, and cultures, and the idiosyncrasies. It’s not just one genre. It’s a wide spectrum of genres, nationalities, and even languages. And we take that job very seriously.”</p><cite>Rocío Guerrero</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“Our mission from the beginning, at least since I’ve come in, has been elevating Latin music, showcasing the different genres from the communities, the cultures, and the idiosyncrasies. It’s not just one genre. It’s a wide spectrum of genres, nationalities, and even languages. And we take that job very seriously,” Guerrero adds, pointing to Amazon Music’s <a href=""https://music.amazon.com.mx/live/events/LBZR0HZEC5"">La Música Que Nos Conecta campaign</a>, an initiative that has celebrated Latin American music genres from across the region since 2023.</p>



<p>But for Guerrero, music has always been a means to a deeper purpose: using its global reach to educate audiences about the diversity and richness of Latin American and Caribbean cultures.</p>



<p>“When I first joined Amazon, I remember this is what I was hoping would happen: to utilize the power and the universe of Amazon to do something with artists that could have an impact on culture and society,” she says. “So this means everything. I’m so proud.”</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11935639.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings, welcome to the week where <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-blood-corn-moon-lunar-eclipse-in-pisces-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">eclipse season</a> officially closes — and it doesn’t end with a whisper, it ends with a roar. On October 6th, the Aries Full Moon rises, bringing to culmination storylines that began back on March 29th, 2025, when the Aries Solar Eclipse cracked open new paths for us. If the spring invited you to name what you want, this week asks: have you fought for it, stood by it, and honored your needs without apology? Expect recognition — whether internal or external — for the seeds you dared to plant months ago. Aries energy doesn’t let you hide. It pushes you onto the stage, spotlight blazing, reminding you that your desires and boundaries matter as much as anyone else’s. <br /><br />And this isn’t just any Aries Full Moon. It’s ruled by Mars, who is currently swimming through the depths of Scorpio. Mercury and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars are both in Scorpio</a>, turning the collective vibe into fiery lava: molten, raw, unmissable. Add Juno, the asteroid of commitment, in Sagittarius, another Fire sign, and you get this rare alchemy of passion, clarity, and intensity. It’s the kind of week where individuals realize their superpowers, and the collective realizes its power to unite. Think strikes, movements, protests, declarations of love, or simply saying “no more” where you’ve stayed quiet too long. Aries + Scorpio = power reclaimed. </p>



<p>But what goes up must eventually ground. From October 8th through the 10th, the Moon shifts into Taurus, cooling the lava into fertile earth. These are the days to slow down, process, and stabilize whatever breakthroughs the Aries Full Moon lit up. Taurus energy reminds us that no matter how wild the firestorm, change only sticks if it’s sustainable. And then comes 10/10, a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025-numerology-meaning"">numerological Ascension Portal</a>, aligned with the Moon’s entrance into Gemini. This is your green light to share, teach, write, or create with levity — all the intensity has prepared you to communicate with both fire and grace. <br /><br />So yes, this is not your typical full moon week. It’s a Mars-ruled supercharge wrapped in Aries initiation, Scorpio intensity, Taurus grounding, and Gemini curiosity. Individually, you’re closing one eclipse chapter and stepping into a braver version of yourself. Collectively, we’re realizing that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/speak-up-be-vocal-mental-health-awareness"">when we speak up</a>, move with conviction, and refuse to shrink, the Universe shifts with us. Stand tall, cosmic beings. You’re entering this week not just as yourself — but as your most unapologetically empowered self yet. <br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831490.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>This week is your cosmic mic-drop moment, Aries. The Full Moon in your sign on October 6th feels like a personal rebirth, one that’s been building since the solar eclipse in Aries back on March 29th. Think of it as six months of shadow work, self assertion, and courage, now culminating in a fiery climax. You may feel lit up and raw, like your entire being is under a spotlight. And yes, that comes with shadows: you might demand intensity or depth from people who just can’t meet you there, or you might project your own restless transformation onto relationships. Be mindful not to burn bridges unnecessarily… you’re leveling up, but not everyone’s on the same timeline, and that’s okay. The lesson here is to honor your growth without needing everyone else to validate it. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mercury has joined your ruler Mars in Scorpio, activating your sector of shared resources, intimacy, and deep transformation. Money talks could get very real: paying off debt, applying for grants, negotiating contracts, or finally clarifying joint financial agreements. Don’t shy away from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/inexpensive-prenup"">these conversations</a>: your clarity is power right now. Venus is spending its final week in Virgo, lighting up your health and wellness zone. It’s a reminder that love doesn’t just show up in romance, it shows up in how safe your body feels in someone’s presence. As you celebrate how much you’ve grown these past six months, practice discernment without nitpicking — both in relationships and with yourself. You’re not meant to feel “done”; you’re meant to feel alive, in motion, and deeply committed to your own evolution. </p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Be honest, Taurus: when was the last time you truly unplugged? This Aries Full Moon is hitting your sector of rest and surrender, so if your body is screaming “nap!” this week, it’s not laziness… it’s literally the astrology of the week. The eclipse season finale is pulling you inward, like the Universe put a “do not disturb” sign on your aura. That might feel weird for a sign that loves stability, but here’s the gag: your growth right now comes from letting go of control. Watch for the shadow of self-sabotage: overworking, overthinking, or staying too available to people who don’t give the same back. <em>What if the most radical move you make this week is saying no, logging off, and </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/protect-your-peace-resolutions-2025""><em>protecting your peace</em></a><em>? </em><br /><br />At the same time, Mercury and Mars are stirring your Scorpio house of partnerships, making convos with bae, besties, or biz partners way spicier. Someone might drop a truth bomb that changes the whole game. Lean into it — this is how bonds deepen or dissolve. Venus is finishing up in Virgo, reminding you in your romance + pleasure zone that love should feel like <em>chill joy, </em>not an exhausting performance review. Who makes your nervous system purr instead of spike? That’s your answer. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The Aries Full Moon is calling BS on your social life, Gemini. Who’s really in your corner? Who’s just here for the memes and vibes, and who’s showing up when it counts? <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-blood-corn-moon-lunar-eclipse-in-pisces-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Eclipse season</a> closing out in your community sector feels like a group chat cleanse. You don’t have to ghost everyone, but you do need to notice where your energy gets hyped versus where it gets drained. And here’s the kicker: sometimes the crowd you crave isn’t even on your current radar. Aries wants you to initiate — join that movement, DM that creative, sign up for that workshop. Stop waiting for the invite. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mercury and Mars in Scorpio are dragging you back to your daily grind, asking: are your routines giving “organized queen” or “chaotic scroll hole”? This is the perfect week to ditch distractions and commit to systems that actually make life smoother. The shadow side? Burning yourself out trying to do <em>all </em>the productivity hacks at once. Venus in Virgo closes out in your home sector, so cozy-fying your nest or setting firmer fam boundaries could be the ultimate form of self-care. Reminder: you don’t need a thousand followers — you need the right ones, both online and IRL. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Career plot twist incoming, Cancer. This week’s Aries Full Moon is at the very top of your chart, and it’s giving <em>main character energy. </em>Spotlight. Recognition. Maybe even a “wait, you do <em>what </em>for work?!” moment from people who’ve been underestimating you. But the catch is this: Aries doesn’t do small talk. If you’ve been hiding your ambition or waiting for permission to shine, this lunation is snatching the excuses away. Shadow alert: don’t let the hunger for external claps drown out your own inner compass. Your worth isn’t up for debate. <br /><br />And oooh, Mercury + Mars are heating up your Scorpio creativity zone, so your muses are LOUD right now. Think late-night writing sprees, love notes that accidentally turn into poetry, or suddenly realizing you want to launch that project you’ve been lowkey scared of. Romance also feels extra magnetic, but again, this isn’t casual; it’s deep, consuming, maybe a little dramatic. Venus ends its Virgo run in your communication house, polishing your words with discernment. Translation? You’ve got receipts and you’re not afraid to use them, but you also know when to speak with grace. By week’s end, you’ll realize: your evolution isn’t about <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/01/11649504/safe-settling-job-security-career-progression"">playing safe in the corner</a>. It’s about stepping on stage, mic in hand, saying, “This is me — deal with it.” </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, this week’s Aries Full Moon is practically daring you to stop shrinking and step into a bigger world. It’s firing up your sector of travel, philosophy, and long-term dreams — aka the part of your chart that screams, <em>go live your main-character montage already. </em>This lunation wants you to risk, expand, and chase the thing you’ve been side-eyeing for months. Shadow check: don’t confuse “bold” with “chaotic.” Just because you feel unstoppable doesn’t mean you need to max out a credit card on a random trip to Bali (unless…). </p>



<p>Mercury and Mars are deep-diving in your sector of home, family, and foundations, so the drama may hit closer to your couch than your passport. Conversations at home could be sharp, revealing, or… a little spicy. Lean in without turning everything into a power struggle. Meanwhile, Venus is wrapping up in Virgo in your money and values sector, reminding you that financial glow-ups require discernment. Translation: treat <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/digital-wallet-benefits-saving-money"">your budget like a canvas</a>, not a cage. Yes, you can splurge, but do it on something that makes your soul and your spreadsheet happy.</p>

<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, the Aries Full Moon is lighting up your sector of intimacy and shared resources, and the question this week is: what (or who) are you really willing to merge with? This lunation brings clarity around money, debt, emotional bonds, or sexual ties — basically anything that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10751082/should-you-trust-your-gut-instinct"">requires deep trust</a>. Shadow side? Expecting 100% transparency from others while still keeping your own cards close to your chest. Aries energy says: honesty first, then decide if the connection is worth your time. <br /><br />On top of that, Mercury and Mars are stirring your sector of communication and learning, so your words are carrying extra punch. Be mindful: you can deliver truth without accidentally stabbing someone with it. Venus is closing out its time in Virgo itself, putting <em>you </em>in the spotlight one last time. That means your aura is magnetic right now, but it also means your inner critic could get loud. Please remember: refinement is cute, self-shaming is not. Own how much you’ve grown since March without nitpicking the parts still in progress. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, this week’s Aries Full Moon is glowing up your partnership sector, which means relationships — romantic, platonic, business, you name it — are center stage. This is the kind of lunation where ultimatums get dropped, confessions spill out, or you finally say “enough” to the dynamics that have been draining you. Shadow check: don’t outsource your self-worth to someone else’s reaction. The Aries Full Moon’s magnetic energy reminds you: your “yes” and your “no” both carry power. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mercury and Mars in Scorpio are igniting your money and resources sector, so expect conversations about finances, investments, or even overdue payments to heat up. This isn’t the week to avoid your budget; it’s the week to get <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/loud-budgeting-money-boundaries"">clear about what’s yours</a> versus what’s theirs. Venus is closing its run in Virgo in your private, spiritual sector, softening the edges and reminding you to take space for yourself amidst all the relational fireworks. The more grounded you feel in your own company, the clearer it’ll be who’s meant to walk beside you. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, the Aries Full Moon is setting fire to your sector of work, health, and daily rhythm this week, so if your routines feel like they’re getting a cosmic performance review, you’re not wrong. This lunation is a wake-up call to check in on what’s actually supporting you versus what’s draining you. Maybe you’ve been overextending yourself or letting perfectionism dictate your schedule, and now your body is like, <em>we need balance, fam. </em>The growth here comes from realizing that efficiency isn’t about doing more… it’s about aligning your energy with what matters most. Don’t just “push through”; redesign your days so they work <em>for </em>you. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mercury and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars are in your sign</a>, which is basically you with a bullhorn: louder, sharper, and less afraid to confront what’s been lurking in the shadows. This gives you the edge to tackle conversations you’ve been avoiding, whether it’s asking for more resources, setting firmer boundaries, or admitting what you actually want. The shadow side? Over-intensity. Not everyone can meet you in the depths, so know when to pull back. Venus is finishing its stay in Virgo in your friendship sector, helping you notice which connections feel nourishing versus which feel transactional. The takeaway: the right people support your growth without draining your spark, and you’ll know exactly who those people are by week’s end. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, this week’s Aries Full Moon is turning the spotlight on your sector of romance, joy, and creative fire… basically the part of your chart that screams <em>fun, fun, fun. </em>This lunation wants you to reclaim pleasure in the ways you may have pushed to the side since March. Think about what hobbies, relationships, or artistic projects make you lose track of time, and then ask yourself why you’re not giving them more space in your life. The shadow side of this moon is overindulgence or chasing thrills just for the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/05/9810670/dopamine-fasting-quarantine"">dopamine hit</a>, but Aries energy wants you to commit to what feels <em>real </em>and life-giving. Your creative spark is valid, so stop minimizing it. </p>



<p>At the same time, Mercury and Mars in Scorpio are activating your spiritual and subconscious sector, making your inner world louder than ever. You might notice dreams getting wilder, intuitive nudges arriving out of nowhere, or buried fears resurfacing. Instead of dodging them, lean in… clarity lives on the other side of discomfort. Venus in Virgo is closing out in your career sector, making this a stellar week to tidy up your professional image or cut ties with draining projects. One more thing: your public life and your private imagination are feeding off each other right now, so pay attention to the subtle ways your creativity wants to shape your next big move. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the Aries Full Moon is sparking change in your sector of home, roots, and emotional foundations, and the question is: do you feel safe where you are? This lunation can feel like a release point around <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-women-healing-panic-attacks"">family patterns</a>, living situations, or the ways you’ve been carrying everyone else’s weight. Shadow side: thinking you have to fix everything and everyone before you allow yourself to rest. Aries energy reminds you that your healing and your sense of home deserve to be a priority, not an afterthought. When you build safety within, everything else can grow from there. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mercury and Mars in Scorpio are energizing your community and friendship sector, which could mean dynamic conversations with your crew or joining a collective effort that feels bigger than yourself. It’s a great week for networking, collaborations, or speaking out, but watch your delivery, Scorpio’s intensity can turn into stingers if you’re not intentional. Venus is wrapping up in Virgo in your adventure sector, encouraging you to expand through learning, travel, or fresh perspectives. Don’t just dream about getting out of your comfort zone; take one concrete step toward it. This week shows you that home is both where you are and where you dare to go next. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, this week’s Aries Full Moon is blasting open your sector of communication and self-expression, and your inbox might as well be on fire. This lunation wants you to speak your truth without watering it down — whether that’s sending the text you’ve been drafting in your head, pitching the idea no one saw coming, or simply telling yourself a new story about what’s possible. Shadow check: watch out for impulsive words that land like grenades. Just because you feel it strongly doesn’t mean you need to hit “send” at 3am. Ask yourself, <em>is this honest or is this just heat-of-the-moment? </em>That extra breath can save a friendship. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mercury and Mars are stirring your sector of career and reputation, which means you’re hot on people’s radar. Power meetings, sudden opportunities, or straight-up confrontations with authority figures may pop this week. This is your cue to own the spotlight instead of side-stepping it — you’ve earned it. Venus is closing its stay in Virgo in your intimacy and shared resources sector, asking you to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/casual-relationship-rules-boundaries"">refine your boundaries</a> around money, sex, and emotional labor. Who drains you, who fuels you, and how are you honoring your own value? By the end of the week, you’ll see clearly: your voice matters, and your boundaries protect the brilliance you’re here to share. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, this week’s Aries Full Moon is illuminating your sector of money, values, and self-worth, so let’s talk coin and confidence. This lunation might highlight what you’ve been hustling for since March — where the financial wins are real and where leaks still need plugging. Shadow side of this full moon? Equating your value to your bank account, or blowing cash to feel validated. Ask yourself: <em>am I </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/labubu-plushie-charm-popularity-high-spending""><em>spending to escape</em></a><em> or to expand? </em>Aries wants you to know your worth first, then act from that grounded place. </p>



<p>At the same time, Mercury and Mars are activating your sector of expansion, meaning your inner philosopher is <em>loud</em>. Big conversations about travel, education, or spiritual growth could spark, and you’re craving experiences that stretch your perspective. Just don’t burn out trying to chase every single path… depth beats scatter right now. Venus finishes its run in Virgo in your partnership sector, highlighting what balance and reciprocity really feel like. Are your connections supporting your growth, or pulling you into old patterns of over-giving? This week, your finances and your relationships both point back to the same truth: when you honor yourself, everything else starts to align. </p>

There have been some stellar <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/book-to-tv-movies-adaptations-2024"">book-to-screen adaptations</a> so far in 2025, from <em><a href=""https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/81751137"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Thursday Murder Club</a></em> to <em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mIvD-GN-p4"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Caught Stealing</a></em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mIvD-GN-p4"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">.</a> While we're slowly inching our way to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/subtle-christmas-nail-art-designs"">Christmas</a>, there are still many more delightful book adaptations to come.

Just look at how massive <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hunger-games"">The Hunger Games</a></em> and <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/twilight-renaissance"">Twilight</a></em> became, with <em>Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping</em> due to land in 2026. Ahead, here are all the book-to-screen adaptations that will be released in 2025. <figure><figcaption><h2>The Lost Bus<br /></h2><br /><em>The Lost Bus</em> is based on <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"">Lizzie Johnson's 2021 book <em>Paradise: One Town's Struggle to Survive an American Wildfire</em>.

It follows the Nuremberg trials, held by the Allies in the aftermath of World War II and saw Nazi Germany leaders on trial for war crimes. <em>Nuremberg </em>follows chief psychiatrist Douglas Kelley as he interviews Nazi military members to see if they are fit to stand trial, including Adolf Hitler's close accomplice, Hermann Göring.<br /><br /><em><strong>Nuremberg </strong></em><strong>will be released in theaters on November 7, 2025<br /></strong> </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Running Man<br /></h2><br />Stephen King is back for yet another book-to-screen adaptation, this time starring Glen Powell, William H Macy, Colman Domingo, Emilia Jones, Josh Brolin and Michael Cera.

<p>Now that <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/09/11934126/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-ending"">The Summer I Turned Pretty</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/09/11934126/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-ending""> Season 3 has wrapped up</a>, it feels like there’s a hole in our hearts. Instead of spending our Wednesday nights with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-conrad-jeremiah"">Conrad Fisher</a> and Belly Conklin, we’re impatiently waiting for <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-movie"">The Summer I Turned Pretty </a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-movie"">movie</a> to come our way. It’s disappointing to lose yet another <em>escape-the-world</em> show, where the messy universe of Cousins Beach and cheating scandals could take your mind off life admin and grown-up problems. Luckily, there are a plethora of other shows to fill the gap — whether you’re after more teenage angst, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/book-to-tv-movies-adaptations-2025"">book-to-screen adaptations</a>, or even another series about a girl torn between two brothers.</p>



<p>From other YA series to classics that still hold up today, here are 9 shows like <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em> to add to your watchlist. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>My Life with the Walter Boys</em></h2>







<p>Lovingly dubbed the “yeehaw version” of <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em> by fans, Netflix’s take on the brother-love-triangle trope is just as addictive as <em>TSITP</em>. Based on a YA Wattpad novel by Ali Novak, it follows recently orphaned teen Jackie (Nikki Rodriguez). After moving from the big city to a country ranch in Colorado, she begins to adjust to life with her mother’s friend and her 11 children. She begins to have feelings for brothers Cole Walter and Alex Walter at the same time, leading to turmoil and angst. </p>

<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>XO, Kitty</em></h2>







<p>From the mind of Jenny Han, creator and writer of <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em>, comes an original spinoff from her <em>To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before </em>trilogy. Following Lara Jean’s (Lana Condor) younger sister Kitty Covey (Anna Cathcart) as she settles into boarding school in Seoul, South Korea, this show provides the perfect mix of K-Drama and what we all loved from the <em>TATBILB </em>movies.</p>



<p><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Netflix</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>Outer Banks</em></h2>







<p><em>Outer Banks (OBX)</em> is one of Netflix’s biggest hits, with four seasons already on the streaming platform. If you’re looking for a beachy vibe like <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em>, add this to your watchlist. </p>



<p>It follows a group of friends in North Carolina on a treasure hunt tied to John B’s (Chase Stokes) father. Expect car crashes, characters being stuck on desert islands, murder and other dramatic storylines.</p>



<p><strong>Where to watch: </strong> Netflix</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>One Tree Hill</em></h2>







<p>If you’re craving love triangles involving brothers, we’ve got another one for you. <em>One Tree Hill</em> follows half-brothers Lucas (Chad Michael Murray) and Nathan Scott (James Lafferty) as fierce basketball rivals, who are also after the same romantic interest, Peyton Sawyer (Hilarie Burton). This show has some of the most heartwrenching cliffhangers and horrifying storylines for a teen drama in history, so if you want to go on a wild ride, add this to your watchlist.</p>



<p><strong>Where to watch: </strong>HBO Max</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>Heartstopper</em></h2>







<p>Another book-to-screen adaptation, <em>Heartstopper</em> captured, well, our hearts when it landed on Netflix. Following a teen romance between Charlie Spring (Joe Locke) and Nick Nelson (Kit Connor), Season 1 and 3 boast a perfect score of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. Like <em>TSITP</em>, the series will conclude with a feature film titled <em>Heartstopper Forever</em>. </p>



<p><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Netflix</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>Dawson’s Creek</em></h2>







<p><em>Dawson’s Creek</em> is the OG teen series, which paved the way for love triangles, angst and drama. Fans have consistently compared Belly’s love triangle with Conrad and Jeremiah to the messy relationships between Dawson, Joey and Pacey. </p>



<p><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Hulu</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>We Were Liars</em></h2>







<p>Prime Video’s newest book-to-screen adaptation hit our screens in June this year, and it’s gripping from beginning to end. Starring Aussie Joseph Zada — who’s leading <em>The Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping</em> — and <em>One Tree Hill’s</em> Barbara Alyn Woods’ daughter Emily Alyn Lind, this mystery thriller will keep you on your toes. It follows Lind’s character Cadence Sinclair, after an amnesia-causing accident, as she tries to piece together what happened last summer. </p>



<p><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Prime Video</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>One Day</em></h2>







<p>If you thought Belly and Conrad’s slow-burning relationship spanning five years was agony, <em>One Day</em> focuses on a relationship between Emma (Ambika Mod) and Dexter (Leo Woodall) across 14 years. Playing heavily into the <em>will they, won’t they</em> trope, <em>One Day </em>is both infuriating and romantic, and could very well have you in tears by the end. </p>



<p><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Netflix</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>Never Have I Ever</em></h2>







<p>Mindy Kaling’s original show <em>Never Have I Ever</em> tackles many of the same themes as <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em>. Exploring grief, finding yourself, love and more, Devi Vishwakumar (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) is the heart of this show — much like Belly. Plus, Devi finds herself in an impossible love triangle between her fierce rival Ben (Jaren Lewison) and the hottest boy in school Paxton (Darren Barnet), with hijinks along the way.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936090.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /><figcaption>Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As the famous saying goes, “Don’t just dream it, be it!” This expression rings true during October 6’s Super Full Harvest Moon in Aries. This rioting lunation brings us back to ourselves and helps us redefine our lives. We hold the power to become the person we are meant to be by<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/yearly-horoscope-2025""> transforming the way we view ourselves</a>. Without drama or fear, we are ready to spark our hearts and embrace ourselves with compassion and kindness. When we look in the mirror, we’ll adore the person we see. We hold the key to this amazing state of mind and glory. <br /><br />A supermoon occurs when the Moon is at perigee to Earth. You may be scratching your head, trying to figure out what the astronomical term means. I’m gonna save you a trip to Google and explain. Simply put: The Moon is closer to Earth than usual, making it appear larger than normal. So, if you’re looking at the night sky and thinking about why the Full Moon is bigger and brighter, it just means it is in a closer orbit to our planet. However, note that the emotional effects of the lunation might hit hard. This season has three supermoons: October 6, November 5, and December 4. </p>



<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/super-harvest-moon-in-aries-horoscope-september-2023"">Harvest Moon</a> is the Full Moon that occurs closest to the Fall Equinox (which was on September 22). This lunation is a time for farmers to secure their bounty and crops as we transition toward the year’s colder months. Spiritually, the Harvest Moon offers celebration, abundance, and blessings. We thank the Earth for its bounty and beauty before heading into the darker days. The Super Full Harvest Moon provides us with a moment of reflection and gratitude, in which we can move towards our inner cravings by balancing out our emotions. It’s a glorious time — no wonder Neil Young’s been crooning about this lunar glow-up for decades.<br /><br />The day of the Harvest Moon has a lot going on, astrologically. For starters, the communication planet, Mercury, dives into Scorpio. Mercury in Scorpio likes to have meaningful and intense discussions. This Mercurial placement is often suspicious of others, leading us to proceed cautiously when trusting others. Our passions will be ignited, even if we have trouble discussing them, as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/water-signs-zodiac-traits-explained"">the water sign</a> is less conversational and more intuitive.  We’ll lean into our emotions and gut feelings — especially when Mercury creates a minor frustration with Neptune retrograde in Aries. If something is off, listen to the voice within and move away from it.</p>



<p>Uranus retrograde in Gemini shares a gentle aspect with the North Node of Destiny, making us run away from the mundane and embrace change. Uranus is walking us up from the daze and haze we’ve been under, allowing us to revolutionize our personal philosophies about how we live and spend our time. We want to seek excitement and joy at all costs by throwing caution to the wind. Be careful not to get too reckless and impetuous because we may regret our decisions later and blame the Moon for our actions. </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/asteroids-astrology-horoscopes-meaning"">The asteroid Ceres</a> (which represents nurturing and TLC) links up with the Moon in Aries, urging us to put self-care and self-love at the top of our priorities. Focus on ventures that make you happy, even if they don’t align with the status quo. Revel in the company of people who challenge your ideology and offer new concepts. Live boldly and greatly — most importantly, unapologetically! <br /><br />The takeaway from the Super Full Harvest Moon in Aries is that we should exist on our own terms. Those who wish to silence us aren’t the people we need to surround us. We can create the dynamics we want and never settle for anything less than what our hearts deserve and desire. The energy will be high, pushing us to rush through our choices and jump into the next best thing or person that catches our fancy. However, it is advisable to watch matters unfold.  March to the beat of your own drum and embrace the most authentic versions of yourself. Cheers to that!</p>

<p>If epic pop culture moments like <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/barbie-brand-collaborations-2023"">Barbie</a></em> and <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-season-3-fashion-collaborations"">The Summer I Turned Pretty</a> </em>have taught us anything, it’s that a timely, well-executed collab can work wonders to transport and immerse viewers into the world of their favorite big- and small-screen characters. And if last year’s countless <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wicked-movie-brand-collaborations"">Wicked</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wicked-movie-brand-collaborations""> brand collections</a> are any indication, we’re gearing up for another season of green and pink everything with the forthcoming release of <em>Wicked: For Good</em>. And naturally, we can’t begin to talk about <em>Wicked </em>collections without mentioning Ariana Grande’s own makeup brand, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/04/10946075/ariana-grande-rem-beauty-ulta"">r.e.m. Beauty</a>.</p>



<p>If you, like me, have been voraciously consuming every morsel of <em>For Good</em> content as the November premiere date approaches, prepare yourselves; <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/featured/rembeauty_art2_wicked25"">r.e.m. Beauty x </a><em><a href=""https://www.ulta.com/featured/rembeauty_art2_wicked25"">Wicked: For Good</a> </em>is the ultimate beauty collection for you to <em>obsessulate</em> over. The <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/featured/rembeauty_art2_wicked25"">limited-edition capsule</a> features nine products, spanning blush trios, plumping lip glosses, metallic eyeliners inspired by the Emerald City, and a very special 12-pan eyeshadow palette inspired by the Ozian Forest — a locale that’s featured prominently in the sequel. Also noteworthy: Two makeup sets inspired by <em>For Good</em>‘s leading ladies, Glinda and Elphaba, with four full-size products each. </p>





<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936079.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>I personally consider myself a Glinda rising, Elphaba sun, and Nessarose moon, so I immediately gravitated towards the moody, earthy tones in the <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/elphaba-makeup-set-pimprod2054985?sku=2645275"">Elphaba Makeup Set</a> and the <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/elphaba-makeup-set-pimprod2054985?sku=2645275"">Ozian Forest Eyeshadow Palette</a>. For an everyday fall look, I used a couple matte neutral shades from the palette — a pale beige called “Confusifying,” “Witching Hour” (a warm tan), and “The Grimmerie” (a milk chocolate) in the crease. Then, I applied a plummy lip &amp; cheek tint from the Elphaba set (the shade is “Braverism,” which…love) as a lipstick and blush, and added the glossy balm in the shade Wickedness (a sheer brown with golden-magenta micro glitter) to round out the lip combo. I already happened to be wearing a green cardigan and my hair in a long braid, which totally brought the Elphaba vibes to life.</p>



<p>Another favorite from the collection is the greenish-gold “Elphie” shade of the <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/starlet-liquid-eyeshadow-pimprod2051262?sku=2637766"">Starlet liquid eyeshadows</a> (my all-time favorite product by the brand), worn underneath the gold metallic shade (“All Roads Lead To The Wizard”) from the Ozian Forest palette, paired with curled lashes and mascara for a statement eye look. </p>





<p>I was already a fan of r.e.m. Beauty, but if you haven’t yet tried the brand, I for one can’t think of a better time to get acquainted than now. You can already shop the full <em><a href=""https://www.ulta.com/featured/rembeauty_art2_wicked25"">Wicked: For Good</a></em><a href=""https://www.ulta.com/featured/rembeauty_art2_wicked25"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""> collection</a> on <a href=""https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/lfYFCBB7E0flV3rwtzfnt2ZwHP?domain=rembeauty.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">rembeauty.com</a>, and at Ulta Beauty stores and <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/featured/rembeauty_art2_wicked25"">online</a> on October 5.

If we've learnt anything from Ginnifier Goodwin, Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis movies<em>,</em> it's that the ""friends to lovers"" cliché is part of the golden trio of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/diversity-representation-rom-coms-lily-chu"">rom-com love stories</a>. Next to the ""enemies to lovers"" trope, and the ""random strangers brought together by fate"" story arc, of course.<br /><br />Making your friend a lover can certainly seem very appealing. There's the satisfaction you'd feel after your friend <em>finally</em> turns around to look at you like<em> that</em>. You've already established closeness and intimacy, and the release of any sexual tension that's been building up for who knows how long can be a relief. It's romantic, confidence-boosting and sexy — and it certainly makes for a really great story.<br /><br />But is it just that — a story? Does getting <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/should-you-date-friend"">romantically involved with a friend</a> really work in real life? While some people say that going from friends to something more creates an unbreakable foundation for a romantic relationship, others believe in the age-old concern that doing so might <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/02/11668705/friendship-breakdown-vacation-travel"">ruin the friendship</a> — and that's more important than anything else. <br /><br /><em>Refinery29 </em>spoke to 10 women about their experiences of going from friends to lovers, and what they learnt about love, sex and friendship along the way.<figure><figcaption><h2>Anwyn (she/they), 23<br /></h2><br />""As a theatre and English literature major, I am absolutely in love with the friends-to-lovers trope. It’s been every <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/situationships-dating-fulfilling-2"">example of a relationship, situationship</a>, crush and friends with benefits that I’ve ever had. I think I love it for many reasons, including that you can trust that person more easily, you know they preemptively already care about you and respect your dignity/autonomy, and also because you see them regularly and are often in social spaces with them.<br /><br />""Whilst it’s been good in that I’ve been able to retain the friendships with these people despite how it ends and love all the individuals deeply as mates, I’m also left feeling really sad because it didn’t eventuate into more of a serious or romantic connection. Because, at a certain point, the other person calls it [off] because they don’t want to lose our friendship, or I myself do the same.<br /><br />""Recently, I heard some wise words from one of my best friends who told me that maybe my love for this trope isn’t actually the best way for me to be navigating love and sex. Maybe instead, I should try going for people who don’t see me just as a friend, first and foremost. It’s pretty hard in reality for friends to lovers to work because friendships are equally as important as lovers, and the boundary between them is more critical than I previously thought.""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Bella (she/her), 23<br /></h2><br />""We were friends before we ever started dating, but he always felt like home to me. I always knew he loved me, but it took me a second to realise that I felt the same. As a teenager, I hadn’t learnt to associate those feelings — of safety and wanting to be with him all the time — with love. The moment I realized this was when he was driving me home one night. He was telling me about the time he broke his arm, and his dad drove him to the hospital. I had this distinct moment where I realized I didn’t want to miss him breaking a bone ever again. I wanted to be there for all of it — highs and lows. <br /><br />""The beautiful thing about going from friends to lovers is even when you’re lovers, you’re still friends. You still want to hang out with them, hear from them, trust them, and believe in them. In my opinion, it’s the best way to do it. Something hard, though, is that over time, it’s easy to fall back into a habit of just being best friends — and you have to work hard to keep up the intimacy of lovers. But it’s a pretty lovely default to fall back on. Could definitely be worse. ""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Sabrina (she/her), 24<br /></h2><br />""It all started happening very slowly. We were already good friends, but we started hanging out every day and, often, I would end up sleeping over because I didn't want to go home to face some things I was dealing with. It was all very gradual. It was a platonic sleepover to start, but over time, we would just inch a bit closer, and then all of a sudden we were secretly sleeping together. I never meant to fall for him. I didn't really think it would happen because I had a very 'I don't want to be in a relationship' mentality at the time. It was fun keeping it a secret, sneaking around. <br /><br />""Then, all of a sudden it had almost been a year, and I was still confused about what I was feeling. He told me he loved me, but just 'not like that'. He actually hooked up with someone else soon after this. All of a sudden, I was left picking up the pieces of my broken heart while trying to navigate what I was feeling. Our friends still didn't know about us, and I had to listen to everyone talk about him and this new girl; it was so painful, and I still feel the mental health repercussions of it to this day. Now, even though he's still around <em>a lot</em>, I'm trying hard to make sure there's some more distance and boundaries between us.""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Laura (she/her), 25<br /></h2><br />""I've been a little bit in love with one of my good friends for as long as I've known them. Not enough to distract me from dating other people or being interested in others, but it's always just lingering there in the background. The 'what if', the possibility — isn't that what makes all friend-to-lover experiences that little bit more exciting? It's often been a matter of timing. Whenever I'm in a relationship, she's not, and vice versa. But we've recently both become single and we've been playfully considering giving it a go.<br /><br />""It's a bit weird because you often have to be a lot franker with a friend if you want something more, instead of that subtle insinuation you have with someone who is already a dating prospect from the start. We've giggled and fumbled a lot as we try to work it out, and every now and then, I'm struck with a fear that we'll mess it all up. Sometimes I think if it was meant to happen it would have ages ago. But I guess we'll see.""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Siobhan (she/her), 27<br /></h2><br />""Trying to go from friends to lovers was one of the worst ideas I've ever had. It was just one of those situations where everything that made us good friends made us bad lovers. The way we used to playfully bicker and tease each other became actual fights. Going to the same parties and events every single week became frustrating instead of fun. What I learnt is that just because you might have sexual tension with someone, does <em>not </em>mean you'll work, or that you should actually pursue them. Sexual tension between friends is almost always gonna be there on some level if you're interested in each other's sex or gender, but more often than not, it's actually meant to just stay platonic.""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Tam (she/her), 25<br /></h2><br />""I’ve known my current partner for 20 years now. We met in the first year of primary school and drifted in and out of friend circles for years. Towards the end of high school, she came into my close friend group as she was dating a best friend of mine. They broke up near graduation, and when <em>we</em> started seeing each other in 2020, things were pretty difficult, seeing as there was that history amongst my friend group. It was quite on and off at the start, and it was even harder for us to have space from each other when we decided to take a break, as we were still in the same friend group. Since the start of 2020, everyone has become much more comfortable with it and we officially started dating — and things have been great ever since. Although, it is tough to have space and do my own thing sometimes as we're always hanging out...!""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Sara (she/her), 26<br /></h2><br />""I was <em>that </em>girl who didn't realise she liked her friend as more than a friend until he got into a serious relationship with someone else. There were many months of pining, tears and jealousy until they split (I swear I had nothing to do with it), and after a while, I decided to shoot my shot. We honestly had a great time together as more than friends. I can count it as one of the better relationships I've ever had. But it ultimately just didn't work — I don't know if it was because we were friends first or if it just wasn't meant to be, but it wasn't right. <br /><br />""I sometimes think I only sparked my attraction to him <em>because </em>he had become off-limits, and I wonder if it still would've happened if things had been different. I'm not a friends with your ex kind of girl, so no, we're not friends anymore. But I'm honestly okay with that. I think people come in and out of your life for different reasons and in different roles. Our time was just up (in more ways than one) but I'm ultimately grateful for the experience.""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Liv (she/her), 24<br /></h2><br />""Despite everyone<em> </em>in our lives suggesting we get together for so many years, we just didn't see it at the time. We had kissed once when we were teenagers but happily left it at that for almost a decade. We fell in love with other people over the years and just lived our lives as friends. I can't even describe how it happened, honestly. One day, when we were finally both single, we just turned around and saw it.<br /><br />""And I thank <em>God </em>that we were friends first. Not only is it just a great story with a really satisfying ending, but we've been communicating for so many years that we're really good at it now. He understands my history and my patterns <em>super </em>well without needing an explanation. I will say that it can be sad not to feel like we're really learning anything new about each other the way other couples might, and we fell into serious marriage-like couple status pretty quickly, so we didn't get that spark-filled stage as much. But we got the ultimate end result and I'm so fine with that.""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Amelia (she/her), 29<br /></h2><br />""My friend and I gave it a go romantically a few years ago, but it didn't end up working out. We'd both felt <em>so </em>much pressure from our friends to get together because we work well in so many ways. We partly got together because we were just curious to see what it would be like, and also because we just wanted everyone to leave us alone! But as is the way in any relationship (I think, especially when you're friends first), don't just get together with someone simply because it seems like a good idea to everyone else. Your relationships aren't meant to only please other people. Luckily, we're still friends now (though we had to take a year-long hiatus after our fling ended to give each other some space), but it could've gone much worse. While I don't regret it, I wouldn't do it again.""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Brie (she/her), 36<br /></h2><br />""I was friends with my partner for a couple of years before I realized that, actually, I wanted more than friendship. So I told him that and asked him out! We were not super close friends — we followed each other on socials and occasionally chatted there and caught up for drinks or dinner. I think our not being super close is what made the move from pals to partners easier. The hardest part was needing to adjust my perspective of him as I got to know him more intimately. Some of that was surprising but mostly it was great. We’ll celebrate four years together later this year, so I think it's fair to say things went pretty well!""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Nikki (she/her), 25</h2><br />""We've been friends since we were five years old. As we got older, we started having on-and-off flings over the years. I always thought, even before we were dating, that we were twin flames. We started sleeping together during COVID lockdowns, but I never thought I would end up with him. I never thought I was actually interested, but we caught feelings fast. It was a difficult transition because we had been friends for so long, and were cautious of ruining it and how it may affect our friends (as we're in the same friend group).<br /><br />""It was difficult because we knew we wanted to be with each other but also that it would be a serious commitment to each other because of our history. But, we made it work. Our love now is super intense and super passionate. It’s a deep love that is built on strong foundations of knowledge and understanding. I’ve never loved anyone this much. Complete and utter devotion. I am so thankful and grateful for it.""</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?</strong></p>",
