<p>Urban living is largely defined by a settled lifestyle. Typically, people anchor their lives around the home, radiating outward to the street and further connecting to workplaces and social activities—together forming a tightly woven living grid. As the starting point of family life, a residence is not merely a place for basic daily functions; it often doubles as a space for professional activity as well. A comfortable living environment often unfolds from the ordinary and familiar acts: dining, sleeping, washing, connecting with others, or engaging in hands-on labor. These moments of daily life construct a complex and secretive spatial structure.</p>",

Yet this version of history overlooks the far larger body of modernist architecture that quietly shaped everyday life across the country.

<h4>I treated my board game like a product and used UX practices to improve its UI—simplifying the game and maxing the fun.</h4><p>As a User Experience (UX) professional, it’s hard to ignore the correlation between UX and board game design. From defining personas, to prototyping and usability testing, to content hierarchy… The parallels are incredible and if you’re a board game designer, you’re likely already doing them, perhaps without knowing it.</p><p>The benefits of applying UX design to board game design only starts here (during the initial design phase). But UX principles are beneficial from start to finish. For example, heuristics can be used to <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-heuristics-board-games/"">audit and improve</a> final UI elements. <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/board-game-ux-help-and-documentation-74335da5ce20"">Information Architecture principles</a> can be used in component design and rulebook creation. And <a href=""https://mindclashgames.com/board-game-iconography-how-smart-symbols-enhance-ux-and-playability/"">leveraging common iconography</a> will ensure players can easily understand intent.</p><p>Here are the key takeaways that you should consider when designing your board game (and will be explored below):</p><ul><li>UX practices will improve your board game.</li><li>You must clearly identify who your game is for, connect with them, and listen to them, in order to improve.</li><li>Having an open mind is critical to the design process.</li><li>Your main job is to steer the ship and bring your vision to life. You need to decide what’s best for your game.</li></ul><p>Before we go any further, let’s all speak the same language. Each time you play a game-in-progress, it’s called a playtest. I have now had many playtests, gotten so much invaluable feedback, and played my game with dozens of people. I sincerely want to thank everyone who have participated in the process for their time and opinion. I would not be where I am today without them.</p><p>WARNING: This is a <strong>deep dive</strong> into the evolution of a single component of a larger board game. A card. This card has gone through roughly 10 iterations, but I’ll focus on 3 critical checkpoints, outlining the changes, what drove those changes, and the learnings along the way. There is <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/board-game-ux-help-and-documentation-74335da5ce20"">definitely a bit of an art</a> to designing the best card design.</p><p>At this point I’ve lost count of how many times I have created what I thought was the “final design” (ok not really, but you get the point). Just like a digital product, a board game is never truly done, until it’s published, but revisions can always come later..</p><p>For now, let’s dive in. Meet Mort.</p><figure><img alt=""An illustration of a character named Mort."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*d5fl77SOt8bg5L_sb-5YUQ.png"" /><figcaption>This was Mort. He’s now dead.</figcaption></figure><p>Now say goodbye. Great Uncle Mort is dead. This should be a solemn occasion, but it’s not.<br />Mort’s house is full of priceless artifacts, questionable heirlooms, and deeply personal stuff that no one will admit to wanting. As his “closest” relatives, you have gathered for the reading of the Will, each of you hoping to walk away with more than your fair share.</p><p>And here’s one of the “questionable heirlooms”, v1 of the item.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a board game card. It has a Taxidermy Ferret. The card also features a suit and value (4 egg), a power (Discard 1 card) and two win condition."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/610/1*STaUU3z1JyiVKkeJcncl2g.png"" /><figcaption>v1 Taxidermy Ferret</figcaption></figure><p>The card has 4 main areas, each trying to communicate something different:</p><figure><img alt=""This shows a breakdown of the 3 card components (suit and value, the flavour text and photo, and the power)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*EV02h1V7EreSixdI77JJpA.png"" /><figcaption>Left: Value and Suit. Middle: Fun. Right: Power.</figcaption></figure><ol><li>Left: This is the value and suit of the card (think 6 of Diamonds).</li><li>Middle: This is the “fun” part of the card. Each card has a unique and quirky item name and picture.</li><li>Right: When a player wins this card, the winner gets a power (good or bad).</li></ol><p>And the 4th card feature:</p><figure><img alt=""The back of the card is black, indicating that the win condition at the top (with a black arrow) is in play. Players must play the highest value Painting to win the Taxidermy Ferret."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sY3T0QJ2sh-WyOQf1AhaDA.png"" /><figcaption>Left: Back of the draw deck of item cards, indicates Black or White. Right: Top box (black arrow) and bottom box (white arrow)</figcaption></figure><p>That last features requires a little explanation. I love interesting mechanics. I came across this game where the back of the draw deck influenced the flipped card’s impact, so I built this into my game.

Voting: Players could now vote Red or Gold to decide the win condition of a card on the table.</p><p>I thought the cards were now amazing. They gave players the ability to vote on win condition. The value and suit were together and easier to see. The win conditions were together at the bottom and colour-matched the voting. AND there was a super cool escape room murder mystery.</p><p>I thought I had addressed all of the feedback and focused on more of what people wanted, more story, less card confusion, more game complexity, no “black/white” battle… but I ignored the most critical feedback, the cards are too busy.</p><p>Now I was hearing feedback like:</p><ul><li>“I find the cards confusing.”</li><li>“There’s a lot on the cards that doesn’t matter right now.”</li><li>“So you can only solve the mystery once?” (Uhhh yes, it’s an escape room!)</li><li>“The tokens (formerly ‘powers’) are so much fun!”</li></ul><p>I took a step back to think about what the game was trying to be. Was the game a way for me to make people think I was smart, or was it trying to make players “feel” like they were bickering greedy relatives at a Will reading (and having fun doing so). Obviously I was aiming for the latter.</p><p>I also decided to take a moment and consider who this game was for: Casual and hobby gamers looking for a palate cleanser between rounds of Wingspan, or Ark Nova. As such, it needed to be less complex, and more focused on the “fun” part. I needed to take another look at the cards, trying to focus more on what the players I was targetting wanted, and MUCH less of what they didn’t want.</p><p>UX Translation:</p><ul><li>I needed to define my Personas and get into their mindset, and only build for them.</li><li>I needed more usability testing.</li><li>I needed to ensure my content hierarchy matched my user’s goals and the context in which they were using my cards.</li><li>My SMEs had influenced too much feature creep.</li><li>I needed to reduce cognitive load of the cards.

I was very happy.</p><p>This also gave me the ability to add more story into the game (what people wanted), introduced Treasures that the players could chase, and allowed me to overhaul the rules of the game to make it feel more like a greedy Will reading, complete with an embezzling Executor! Everything just clicked and the game felt much more fun &amp; engaging, felt like a bunch of greedy relatives bickering, and most importantly, was far less confusing.</p><p>Overall, taking a <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/board-game-ux-minimalist-design-ab812ee5412d"">minimalist design approach to the card</a> (instead of trying to have one card to more work than it should) made the card easier to understand, added more space for thematic fun, and improved the game overall.</p><p>I need to do even more playtesting, but based on the feedback I’ve already heard from this newest version, I believe the cards (at least) are “ready”. Over this journey the most critical takeaways were:</p><ul><li>You must clearly identify who your game is for and build for them.</li><li>Your game will only improve if you remain open to feedback (even if it means shelving something you really like – it can always come back, in this game or the next one)</li><li>Stay focused on your vision – just because ideas are shared, doesn’t mean implementing them will make your game better. It’s your game, you decide.</li></ul><p>If you are curious to what attending the Will reading and is like, the game draws inspirations from <a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/115/im-the-boss"">I’m the boss</a>, <a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172/for-sale"">For Sale</a>, and <a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/220/high-society"">High Society</a>.</p><p>As you can see, board game design and UX go hand in hand. Designing for your audience is like Persona creation. Playtesting is like usability testing. The playtesting mindset is the Design Process Model, expanding and contracting as you identify and work to resolve negative feedback. Having a deep background in User Experience has helped greatly, and sped up my game design process. It’s been 2 months since Great Uncle Mort is Dead was born, and I think I’m ready to start pitching it to publishers. I would not be here today without both my obsession with board games, and my passion for User Experience.</p><p>If you’ve made it this far and would like to talk about board game design, or user experience, let’s connect.</p><p>All cards were designed by me and include iconography from NounProject, whereas the illustrations of the Taxidermy Ferret, Mort, the scrolls, and “Mona Lisa” were AI generated as placeholders. If and when this game is published they will likely be replaced, by the publisher.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=97bfcdb1d581"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/ux-in-board-game-design-97bfcdb1d581"">UX in board game design</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>What actually goes into a good prompt, and why most advice skips this</h4><figure><img alt=""Illustration of hands holding binoculars with eyes, looking at a floating photo of a person."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RNqin4edZ02x53nGTpedjw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>If you’re trying to learn how to write good Figma Make prompts, you’ve probably hit the same wall I did.</p><p>Most advice stays abstract.<br /><em>Be clear. Add context. Explain intent.</em></p><p>None of that helps when you’re staring at an empty prompt box wondering what actually needs to go in there.</p><p>What’s missing in the industry right now isn’t more frameworks. It’s <strong>real examples</strong>. <em>Full prompts.</em> End-to-end inputs you can actually read and learn from.</p><p>By the end of this post, you should have a clearer sense of what actually belongs in a Figma Make prompt, based on <strong>real inputs that already work</strong>.</p><p>Instead of inventing yet another framework, I looked at what already exists. I studied real inputs, tested them, and compared the results. This post documents that process using <strong>real prompts, real tradeoffs, and real constraints</strong>.</p><p>If you’re new to Figma Make, this will help you get unstuck. If you’ve already used it, this will help you waste fewer prompts.</p><h3>TL;DR</h3><p>Most Figma Make advice is vague. It tells you to <em>“add context”</em> without showing what a good prompt actually looks like.</p><p>This post breaks down <strong>three real approaches designers are already using</strong> to write Figma Make prompts:</p><ul><li>using a PRD as the prompt</li><li>translating loose inputs into Make-ready instructions</li><li>pressure-testing intent with a simple checklist</li></ul><p>Instead of frameworks, this post shows <strong>full prompts end to end</strong>, including the <em>tradeoffs, time cost, and limitations</em> that come with them. The goal isn’t better prompts for their own sake. It’s <strong>fewer reruns, clearer intent, and workflows that still hold up</strong> as these tools become more constrained and more expensive.</p><p>If you only read one section, read <em>Applying this in practice</em>.</p><h3>Why focus on prompts at all?</h3><p>There are a lot of <a href=""https://youtu.be/9Y2Yz-ir3JM?si=OdP19cX5G_KxycwT"">ways to use Figma Make</a>. You can begin with simple inputs like images or existing files, then move into more advanced options such as the Point-and-Edit tool, connecting a library (organization and enterprise plans only), or editing code.</p><p>This post focuses on <strong>prompt writing</strong> because it offers the most leverage. From a blank canvas, you can create something surprisingly robust, including a <strong>working prototype</strong>. The ability to <em>build from scratch, clearly and intentionally</em>, is going to be in high demand.</p><h3>Three approaches worth studying</h3><p>Each of these comes from a respected voice in the industry and reflects a <strong>real way people are already working with Figma Make</strong>. I’m using them as concrete examples to break down what goes into an effective prompt, then translating those lessons into a <strong>real, actionable prompt</strong> you can study and edit yourself.</p><figure><img alt=""E-commerce cart page prototype generated from a PRD-based Figma Make prompt"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jveEH8DMXsq1KraXCEr0eQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>E-commerce cart prototype generated from a PRD-based Figma Make prompt</figcaption></figure><h3>1. Product requirements document (PRD)</h3><p>This example comes from a <a href=""https://youtu.be/EUPbdk972JI?si=xojfXzYqwVfEFNbe""><strong>YouTube video</strong></a><strong> by Jesse Showalter</strong> of Design Champs and uses a PRD as the prompt itself.</p><p>A PRD, or <strong>product requirements document</strong>, is a written description of what you’re trying to build. It lays out what the screen does, how it behaves, the rough layout, key states, and constraints like responsiveness or accessibility. It’s not a visual artifact. It’s a <em>thinking artifact</em>.</p><p>What makes this example valuable isn’t just the output. It’s the <strong>input</strong>.</p><p>The video doesn’t share the <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1diXC36YL9u1wd2hw40oi4N98gvp5xnjaUe7nOomr_EU/edit?usp=sharing""><strong>full prompt text</strong></a>, but I tracked it down and included it so you can read it end to end. Being able to see the entire prompt makes it much easier to understand <em>why</em> the result works and what kind of detail actually carries weight.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/664cd3ac21e30bb8ce1528cf52f9a374/href"">https://medium.com/media/664cd3ac21e30bb8ce1528cf52f9a374/href</a><p>When I reused that same prompt, it produced a solid, <a href=""https://legal-mosaic-22940652.figma.site""><strong>interactive prototype</strong></a> for a clothing store experience that I could copy back into Figma and continue iterating on. That’s what made the PRD powerful. <strong>It could be reused, and it produced consistent results.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Color palette prototype created from a prompt generated by the Make Prompt Assistant (custom GPT)."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FSXsKlc4qrviP2N1CmxwnQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Color palette prototype created from a prompt generated by the Make Prompt Assistant (custom GPT).</figcaption></figure><h3>2. Make Prompt Assistant</h3><p>The <strong>Make Prompt Assistant</strong> is a <strong>custom GPT available in ChatGPT</strong>, created by <strong>Greg Huntoon</strong>, a Design Manager at Figma.</p><p>What makes this approach useful is how quickly it gets you unstuck. You can start with something loose, like <em>“create a website inspired by coolors.co,”</em> and it will generate a <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wBUKRv7qUtIL2FlhWJjFjHLEgR-xEsVylHdKpFp3itA/edit?usp=sharing""><strong>structured prompt</strong></a> you can hand directly to Figma Make.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/35c2b2c7e3de8eef91a455841b8f49d2/href"">https://medium.com/media/35c2b2c7e3de8eef91a455841b8f49d2/href</a><p>This approach isn’t as robust as writing a prompt from scratch. You give up some flexibility because you’re not explicitly defining every decision. The assistant fills in gaps for you, which means <strong>some intent is inferred rather than specified</strong>.</p><p>The resulting prototype is a <em>solid starting point</em>. It provides structure and momentum, but it still needs refinement. That’s expected. This works best as a <strong>first pass</strong>, not a single, fully defined prompt.</p><p><strong>Core prompt structure</strong>:</p><ul><li>Task: what to build or change</li><li>Context: where it lives in the product</li><li>Elements: literal UI components</li><li>Behavior: interactions, states, logic</li><li>Constraints: device, layout, rules</li></ul><h3>3. TOKEN framework</h3><p>The <a href=""https://medium.com/ux-planet/a-practical-prompting-guide-for-figma-make-eb72f78ff1ce""><strong>TOKEN framework</strong></a> comes from <strong>Nick Babich</strong>, Product Designer and Editor-in-Chief of <strong>UX Planet</strong>, and was originally published on Medium.</p><p>TOKEN is the most explicit about structure. Rather than telling you to <em>“be clear,”</em> it defines what clarity actually means by naming the categories prompts often miss.</p><p>It doesn’t guarantee a good result, but it <strong>significantly reduces the chance that something important is missing</strong> from the first prompt.</p><p>I don’t think of TOKEN as a rigid script. I use it as a <em>pressure check</em> before handing control over to Make.</p><p>TOKEN stands for:</p><ul><li>Task: what exactly do you want the AI to do</li><li>Output: what should the final result look like</li><li>Key design elements: what must be included</li><li>Expected behaviors: how it responds to interaction</li><li>Notable constraints: platform, accessibility, brand, or technical rules</li></ul><h3>What these approaches have in common</h3><p>All three approaches required knowing what you wanted to <strong>build</strong> and having a clear sense of how it should function, what it should look like, and whether there were existing examples to pull from.</p><p>None of them worked well without that clarity up front. Before Make could produce anything useful, the <strong>decisions were already in place</strong>.</p><p>Across all three, prompts improved once these basics were settled:</p><ul><li>what was being built</li><li>what it was for</li><li>how it should behave</li><li>which constraints mattered</li></ul><p>When those decisions weren’t settled, prompts became harder to write and outputs became less predictable. Prompting didn’t resolve that uncertainty. <em>It surfaced it.</em></p><h3>How they differ in structure and intent</h3><p>Where these approaches differ is <strong>how and when those decisions get made</strong>.</p><p>Using a PRD pushes nearly all of the decision-making up front. You define intent explicitly, which gives you the most control and makes it possible for a single prompt to carry a lot of weight. The tradeoff is effort. Writing that level of clarity takes time.</p><p>The Make Prompt Assistant shifts some of that work to the tool. It’s useful when you have a loose idea or reference and want to get moving quickly, but some intent is inferred rather than specified. Refinement happens through iteration rather than a single, fully defined prompt.</p><p>TOKEN doesn’t create intent at all. It acts as a checkpoint. It’s most useful right before you run a prompt, when you want to verify that nothing important has been missed.</p><p>Once a design already exists, <strong>short, targeted prompts tend to outperform any framework</strong>. One change. One target.</p><figure><img alt=""Prototype created by applying a PRD-inspired prompt shaped by the techniques explored in this article."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KOEOPQIVS2zeUMGanM8kuQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Prototype created by applying a PRD-inspired prompt shaped by the techniques explored in this article.</figcaption></figure><h3>Applying this in practice</h3><p>After studying these approaches, I applied them to a real use case to see what actually held up.</p><p>I used a marketplace browsing experience similar to Etsy because it reflects the kind of work many designers deal with day to day. Search, filters, product grids, seller identity, favorites, responsive behavior, and accessibility are all common requirements on real product teams. This wasn’t a demo scenario. It was something I could realistically see a team needing to prototype.</p><p>I set one constraint up front: <strong>one prompt, no edits</strong>.</p><p>The goal wasn’t to keep nudging Make until it behaved. It was to push as much decision-making as possible into the prompt itself and see whether a single input could produce a functional result without follow-up corrections. The prototype mattered, but <strong>the real focus was the prompt</strong>.</p><p>For comparison, a previous <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/i-built-a-game-app-in-figma-make-41c54b89fd7f"">Figma Make game app</a> project I built completely from scratch took around <strong>680 prompts over four days</strong>. This experiment took closer to <strong>40 prompts and about eight hours</strong>. The difference wasn’t UI complexity. It was <strong>how much structure existed before Make ever ran</strong>.</p><p>Getting to a <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LuUpmb4H52zfvORxAH2AQ8fLrxyncsFR2fPT1O-orT8/edit?usp=sharing""><strong>single prompt</strong></a> that could generate a fully functioning prototype without edits was time-consuming. Each prompt run took roughly <strong>10 to 15 minutes</strong>, and as the prompt grew longer, Make would sometimes skip over details that were already written. That meant certain requirements had to be reinforced more than once.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/7a31f61c7fa063786f6175e058325526/href"">https://medium.com/media/7a31f61c7fa063786f6175e058325526/href</a><p>In practice, those gaps were easy to fix by asking Make to review the prompt again and adjust specific areas. But that wasn’t the experiment. The experiment was to see <strong>how far a one-pass prompt could realistically go on its own</strong>.</p><p><em>I didn’t fully reach that goal.</em></p><p>In some runs, the prompt produced exactly what I asked for. In others, small but important things broke or behaved inconsistently. Filters didn’t respond as expected. Menu states worked in one run and failed in another. Hover text occasionally rendered unreadable. None of these issues were hard to fix with additional prompting, but needing to fix them at all was the point. <strong>The variability mattered</strong>.</p><p>Based on this work, I don’t think Figma Make is consistently there yet. It’s close, but <strong>not reliable enough to guarantee that outcome every time</strong>.</p><p>To be honest, this was frustrating. <strong>Figma Make is an innovative tool</strong> and a clear signal of where design workflows are headed, but it still feels closer to a beta product than a finished one. It’s powerful for prototyping and exploration, but there’s work left to be done, especially as it moves toward a <a href=""https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/33459875669015-How-AI-credits-work""><strong>credit-based model</strong></a>. Being charged for prompts that <strong>fail, drift, or ignore requirements</strong> is a real concern.</p><p>At the same time, I don’t think this is a static system. Figma has a strong track record of iterating quickly, and I expect many of these rough edges to improve as Make matures. Even so, the direction is clear. <strong>Prompting is becoming part of day-to-day design work</strong>, and cost will increasingly be tied to <strong>how clearly intent is defined up front</strong>.</p><p>That’s why <strong>understanding how to write clear, effective prompts matters now</strong>. This isn’t about perfection. It’s about being prepared for how design workflows are changing and what that change will cost.</p><p>I wrote this because I couldn’t find the article I wanted when I started. One that showed <em>real prompts, real tradeoffs, and real constraints</em>.</p><p>If this helps you approach prompting with more confidence and intention, it did its job.</p><h3>References</h3><ul><li>Showalter, Jesse. <em>Using Figma Make to Go From Nothing to Interactive Prototypes</em>.

<h4>A story from the field: the day safeguarding became real</h4><figure><img alt=""Laptop, phone and book chained together, symbolising safeguarding and data security in user research fieldwork.

Source: Pexels.</figcaption></figure><p>During a discovery project, I was visiting education settings across England to run in‑person research. That meant working inside real-world constraints: safeguarding processes, visitor protocols, staff availability, young people moving through corridors, rooms that suddenly became unavailable, and the constant awareness that you’re a guest in someone else’s environment.</p><p>At one site, we were told (almost casually) that more than half the staff were off sick with COVID, and another bug was doing the rounds. The cherry on top was that we were crammed into a small basement room that was colder than the rest of the building, so no ventilation, and a very high chance of catching whatever was circulating.</p><p>Two days later, I was ill. I stayed ill for weeks. I couldn’t take sick leave due to tight deadlines and stakeholders picking on any leave taken as “delaying the project”.</p><p>That was my reminder that:</p><blockquote>Safeguarding isn’t only about what happens <strong>in</strong> the session. It’s also about what happens <strong>around</strong> the session: infection risk, travel load, lone working, fatigue, access, and the logistics nobody puts on the Gantt chart, including allowance for sick leave.</blockquote><p>And if you think that’s “just wellbeing” …well, it isn’t. It’s research quality. When researchers are depleted, rushed, anxious about getting to the next site, or taking avoidable health risks, the work gets worse. Decision-making gets shakier, debriefs get skipped, boundaries blur, and the conditions for ethical, high-quality research quietly erode.</p><p>The safeguarding plan template I share with you (at the end of this article) is informed by what I now call “interesting” field notes (though at the time, they were mildly psychosis‑inducing events!). I’m sharing 7 field notes to set the stage for why (and I cannot emphasise this enough) a safeguarding plan really matters.</p><h4>Field note #1: the invisible entrance</h4><p>On one visit, I arrived at what looked like a massive establishment, but couldn’t find the entrance. Construction work, temporary buildings, and exactly zero signposting added to the pain. I spent the first 15 minutes convincing myself I’d come to the wrong place, while my Uber driver (now a distant memory) had left me in what felt like a no-man’s-land.</p><p>I rechecked Google Maps like 50 times, reread my emails and tried contacting the reception by calling but no luck.</p><p>Eventually, a stranger appeared, also going to the same place, pointed me to the entrance like a human “you are here” sign. It was like going through a maze!</p><p>No one had done anything malicious in this case. I’d sent confirmation emails. They’d replied. We’d all behaved like professionals. But nobody had thought to say:</p><blockquote>“Entrance is currently around the back, follow the temporary fencing and come through the metal gates where all the clinical waste bins are lined up, and ignore the sign that lies.”</blockquote><p>It wasn’t their “fault”. It was the assumption that got me. I did not treat basic navigation and access as part of safeguarding. The fix, is boring and brilliant:</p><blockquote>Ask for <strong>photos of the entrance</strong>, a <strong>named contact with a mobile number</strong>, and a plan for what happens if you can’t get in within 10 minutes.</blockquote><figure><img alt=""Building entrance hidden behind construction work (scaffolding) and confusing signage.

It had the architectural charm of a storage unit and the safety profile of, let’s say, “optimistic”.</p><p>One evening, we were preparing for a large-scale randomised controlled trial. We were printing and packing hundreds of consent forms, participant information sheets, and supporting documentation (ethical approval, what you need to know etc.). The kind of admin tasks that convinces you that your PhD is mainly an advanced qualification in stapling and packing envelopes.</p><p>Due to the looming deadline, I stayed late. A few others stayed late too.</p><p>At some point, without noticing, I became the last person in the building. And for some reason the main door would not open. I was stuck, and it was way past lone‑working hours. There were no CCTV cameras inside the building, and the dread of my supervisor finding out (and then them getting in trouble) was doing a lovely little duet with my panic response.</p><p>I called a friend who lived nearby. Luckily, they were home and they came and got me out.</p><p>Weeks later, I found out a different office in that same building had caught fire because a student smoked inside a wooden shed and left a still‑lit cigarette butt in a bin full of paper. The fire alarm did its job (thankfully). However, the final-year PhD student’s work couldn’t be rescued.</p><p>I’m sharing this because it’s the most predictable safeguarding lesson in academia (and beyond):</p><blockquote>Lone working isn’t a badge of honour. It’s a risk that needs a plan.</blockquote><h4>Field note #3: the re‑traumatisation</h4><p>Now for the one that still makes my eye twitch.</p><p>There was an opening event for a trial involving eating disorders. An influencer with lived experience was invited (paid to attend by public funding!). A media presence was expected. The senior investigator bragged about having “useful connections” in high places (because nothing says “scientific rigour” like name‑dropping your minister cousin).</p><p>Thank goodness the broadcaster didn’t show up, and neither did the “very important cousin”.</p><p>But what did happen was worse in a quieter way: there were clearly people in the room being impacted by the choices made around food, messaging, and the theatre of it all. It was a masterclass in how a team can be so focused on “PR” that they lose sight of basic emotional safety.</p><p>Putting large quantities of food and drinks in front of people (including the influencer herself) was not thoughtful. It was triggering for many because they were there due to lived experience of battling severe eating disorders that included <strong>anorexia, bulimia and so on</strong>… and then you have staff enthusiastically eating and drinking through it all.</p><p>That experience sharpened a point I now say out loud in project kick-offs:</p><blockquote>You can have all the ethics paperwork in the world. If your team culture treats re‑traumatisation as an abstract risk rather than a real human outcome, you don’t have safeguarding, you have compliance cosplay.</blockquote><p>And if the most senior person is the risk, you need a pre-agreed speak‑up route (not just “be brave”). A stop rule. A named escalation contact outside the immediate hierarchy, and a culture where safeguards are rehearsed, not improvised. In academia, the ethics board that approved the study is one route of escalation.</p><figure><img alt=""Measuring tape wrapped around an apple symbolising diet and eating disorders.

Everything looked “approved” on paper. Then I arrived, and suddenly I had no access. Nobody would speak to me and I was told to wait in reception for hours. Doors that should have opened didn’t. The relationship between the university and the partner organisation had fractured at a senior level, and I’d been left out of the loop.</p><p>So there I was with wasted travel cost, time, energy, preparation and a hard stop. This is safeguarding too.</p><blockquote>Because safeguarding is also about protecting the <strong>work</strong> and the <strong>researcher</strong>. If a breakdown in institutional comms can strand you physically, professionally, and emotionally (and sometimes financially), then it needs to sit in the risk register like any other operational risk.</blockquote><p>The question we rarely ask is who covers what? Before I now travel for fieldwork, I confirm insurance/indemnity and cancellation rules:</p><ul><li>who covers travel costs if access collapses,</li><li>whether professional indemnity/public liability applies (especially if contracting), and</li><li>who has authority to pause/stop fieldwork if safety conditions change.</li></ul><h4>Field note #5: families as a risk variable</h4><p>In social care settings, there’s another layer that rarely makes it into tidy templates:</p><blockquote>Families can be protective and brilliant, and they can also be chaotic, accusatory, and sometimes actively harmful.</blockquote><p>During my time working in social care and in an NHS rehab service, I’ve seen families raise serious concerns that were absolutely legitimate and needed action.</p><p>I’ve also seen families create issues where there were none. And I’ve seen situations where family members were taking money from someone in care, then implying it was the setting’s fault or that the staff “didn’t do their job properly” and attempting to escalate formally.</p><p>As researchers, we don’t prosecute. But we do need to plan for:</p><ul><li>third‑party risk,</li><li>allegations and counter‑allegations,</li><li>reputational volatility,</li><li>and the possibility that “what’s true” is not always clear in the moment.</li></ul><h4>Field note #6: when the VPN and firewall are so safe they break the research</h4><p>In one organisation, we assumed the laptops provided would seamlessly connect to Wi‑Fi on sites being visited. Trust me when I say: they did not. The firewall and VPN were so secure that even the host IT team couldn’t troubleshoot the connection.</p><p>The result was that MS Teams wouldn’t run, recording didn’t work, and there was no built‑in audio recording on the laptop. I also didn’t have a dedicated work mobile, so using my personal phone to capture audio would have breached policy.</p><p>We defaulted to note-taking, but even that became an issue because uploads to the analysis tool kept failing. We ended up with an incomplete dataset and analysis that relied far too much on memory.</p><p>Safeguarding lesson here is that you need a pre‑agreed offline plan (confirming Wi‑Fi access arrangements and device/VPN constraints in advance of the visit, approved recording routes, secure note templates, and a contingency for when tech fails), especially in high-stakes/high-security settings.</p><p>Another important thing to note is that in high-security settings like prisons, secure mental health hospitals, and immigration environments, safeguarding escalates because power imbalance is built into the setting. Recording may be prohibited altogether, device access may be restricted or denied, staff may be present in the session impacting what is said and shared, and “voluntary participation” can be complicated. For such settings, your safeguards need to be even more robust and explicit like having a paired working and no lone-working at all.</p><h4>Field note #7: not everyone is willing to participate</h4><p>One of the biggest lessons I learned is that not everyone will participate, even when your intentions are good and your paperwork is flawless. In some communities, trust is not easy to earn.</p><p>I’ve turned up at settings where I simply couldn’t access the voices I came to hear. Some communities have rational reasons for being cautious: history, extraction, misrepresentation, and previous “research” that didn’t translate into change.</p><p>This taught me that refusal is data too, not a failure. Safeguarding here means:</p><blockquote>Designing for cultural safety and voluntariness which may look like working through trusted community connectors, using culturally appropriate facilitators where needed, offering different modes of participation, and being explicit that saying “no” to participation has no consequences.</blockquote><figure><img alt=""Human holding a banner saying ‘No’ against a yellow background.

They’re pragmatic. They improve safety, choice, and trust, which tends to improve the quality of what people are able (and willing) to share.</p><p>In research terms, a trauma‑informed lens pushes you to design sessions where participants:</p><ul><li>know what’s coming,</li><li>have meaningful control,</li><li>can opt out without penalty,</li><li>and aren’t pushed into disclosure “for the sake of insight”.</li></ul><p>It also forces a professional acknowledgement that researchers can be impacted too by vicarious trauma, fatigue, stress, and the physical reality of operating in high‑pressure systems.</p><h4>2) Factoring in incentives (as a safeguarding decision, not just admin)</h4><p><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9631331/"">Incentives can reduce barriers to participation</a>, but they can also create pressure, bias, or risk.</p><p>I treat incentives as part of safeguarding:</p><ul><li>It must never be framed as “payment for disclosure”.</li><li>It should not be conditional on answering every question or completing the session fully (especially in the digital world where 45 minutes into a 60 minute session, the connection breaks, or a participant faces issues when re-joining the session).</li><li>It must be safe and discreet to deliver (cash can create risk; digital delivery can create privacy issues where emails, bank account details are shared).</li><li>It <a href=""https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/research-and-innovation/research/Assets/Documents/PDF/ethics-incentives-reimbursement-etc-v5.pdf"">should be equitable</a>: if we pay for time, we should consider expenses and participation costs (travel, childcare, food etc.).</li></ul><p>And yes, incentives can attract misrepresentation. People may tell you what they think gets them “into the study”, or what they think will please you. That’s not a reason to remove incentives; it’s a reason to:</p><ul><li>design screening carefully and thoughtfully,</li><li>avoid recruitment through coercive gatekeepers,</li><li>and be clear that incentives are not linked to “performing” as a good participant.</li></ul><h4>3) Consent and assent (done properly, not performatively)</h4><p>This is the part that matters most, especially when vulnerable people are involved.</p><p><a href=""https://www.hra.nhs.uk/planning-and-improving-research/best-practice/informing-participants-and-seeking-consent""><strong>Consent</strong></a><strong> for adults with capacity</strong> must be informed, freely given, specific, and ongoing (reconfirm at key moments).</p><p><strong>Children: </strong><a href=""https://www.hra-decisiontools.org.uk/consent/principles-children.html#:~:text=Consent%20is%20a%20legally%20defined,their%20capacity%20when%20seeking%20assent.""><strong>consent + assent</strong></a></p><ul><li>Parental/guardian consent may be required (depending on policy and age).</li><li>Child assent should still be sought even when an adult has consented on their behalf.</li></ul><p>Assent is not a tick-box. It’s the child’s affirmative agreement, expressed in age-appropriate ways. And here’s what it may look like:</p><ul><li>If the child does not want to take part, verbally or non‑verbally, we stop.</li><li>If the child wants to stop partway through, we stop.</li><li>If the child wants to skip a question, we skip it.</li></ul><p>No negotiation. No persuasion. No “just one more question.”</p><p><strong>Vulnerable adults/adults who may lack capacity: </strong><a href=""https://www.cqc.org.uk/guidance-regulation/providers/regulations-service-providers-and-managers/health-social-care-act/regulation-11""><strong>supported decision‑making + assent</strong></a></p><ul><li>Use supported decision-making (plain language, time, breaks, visuals, accessible formats).</li><li>Check understanding by asking them to explain back (in their own words) what will happen, what will be recorded, and that they can stop.</li></ul><p>If a person cannot understand/retain/weigh the information or communicate a decision even with support:</p><ul><li>you cannot rely on their consent alone,</li><li>you may need a legally authorised representative process (depending on jurisdiction/policy),</li><li>and you should still seek the person’s assent and monitor for distress or dissent.</li></ul><p>And again: if they show they don’t want to continue, we stop.</p><p><strong>Gatekeepers (who protect voluntariness)</strong><br />Teachers, carers, clinicians, managers, and yes, prison staff, can enable access and unintentionally pressure participation. Build in:</p><ul><li>a private opt‑out route,</li><li>clear “no consequence” language,</li><li>and a cooling-off window where appropriate.</li></ul><h3>5 things I now do before I enter any setting (and why)</h3><p>These are the “unsexy” steps that make fieldwork safer, and prevent heroics from becoming the plan:</p><h4>1) Map safeguarding on both sides (and confirm clearance)</h4><ul><li>Identify the host setting’s safeguarding lead and read their safeguarding policy before you arrive.</li><li>Identify your organisation’s safeguarding lead and escalation route.</li><li>Make sure both ends know how to reach each other quickly.</li><li>Confirm clearance requirements early (e.g., enhanced DBS, prison/security vetting, NHS site rules). If clearance won’t land in time: pivot method early.</li></ul><h4>2) Build a fieldwork tracker (treat it like an asset, not admin)</h4><p>Document:</p><ul><li>where you’re going (exact building location),</li><li>photos of the entrance if it’s a complex site,</li><li>who you’re meeting (names where appropriate, roles, agreed contact details),</li><li>a named contact with a mobile number,</li><li>timings, check‑in/out times, contingency routes,</li><li>language requirements (do participants communicate in English; do you need an interpreter).</li><li>Inform the setting that you’ll need to access their network and ask for WiFi and device connectivity early on so you avoid delays on the day.</li><li>Create a separate tracker for your participants where you use participant IDs but keep participant contact details separate.</li><li>Have a tracker for research work where you keep a record of what was recorded, with whom, who conducted the session, who took notes, who observed, what supplementary material was provided, if you upload the material and notes etc. For online research, you can adapt this tracker (links, time zones, backup numbers, “what if the platform fails”).</li><li>For data security, upload to secure storage promptly, and don’t rely on “I’ll sort it later” when you’re travelling.</li></ul><h4>3) Treat public health as part of safeguarding (post‑COVID reality)</h4><p>Before in‑person work:</p><ul><li>ask the site about outbreaks or visitor restrictions,</li><li>confirm PPE expectations (even if “optional”),</li><li>decide in advance what triggers a reschedule or a switch to remote.</li></ul><h4>4) Plan reset capacity like it’s a delivery constraint (because it is)</h4><ul><li>Cap the number of intensive visits per week.</li><li>Build half-day resets into schedules where needed.</li><li>Protect debrief time as non‑negotiable (not a “nice to have”).</li></ul><p>People who haven’t done fieldwork often only see the interview hour. They don’t see the off-stage work: ethics, documentation, travel (and all the drama of delays and connectivity), relationship management, safeguarding alignment, the emotional labour of holding space, and the operational coordination required to get usable data without harming anyone.</p><p>So if your team asks for frequent check-ins or expects you to do additional work, ensure that you set their expectations by walking them through all the off stage work needed.</p><h4>5) Run a dynamic risk assessment on the day (including semi‑public spaces)</h4><p>Conditions change fast: staffing, space, local incidents, illness levels, travel disruption. Your plan needs a mechanism for responding without stress.</p><p>And if you’re observing in semi‑public spaces (corridors, waiting rooms, receptions): plan for bystanders who didn’t consent. Decide what you record, how you protect privacy, and when you pause or reposition.</p><h3>My template (use it and adapt it)</h3><p>I’m sharing the template I now use as a default for discovery projects, user research and service design work across education, health, social care, pharmaceutical, justice, and other high‑stakes environments.</p><p>It’s intentionally written as a template: you’ll need to tailor it to your organisation’s safeguarding policy, ethics process, and the host setting’s local requirements.</p><p>If you’re working with children or vulnerable adults, you should always align the plan with the host organisation’s safeguarding lead and your own organisational safeguarding lead before fieldwork starts.</p><h3>Safeguarding plan template for research (and design)</h3><h3>1. Document control</h3><p>Table 1 shows the data fields that you can use for document control.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of a table showing document control data fields."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TanZZ_EDe27dSYWzyrZ7gg.png"" /><figcaption>Document control data fields.

Purpose and scope</h3><p>This plan sets out how we prevent harm, recognise distress or risk, respond to concerns (including disclosures), and learn from incidents. It covers:</p><ul><li>Participant safeguarding (physical, psychological, cultural, and digital safety)</li><li>Researcher safeguarding (physical safety, psychological wellbeing, and lone-working)</li><li>Safeguarding of third parties (people mentioned during research, bystanders, or dependents)</li><li>Data governance and reporting practices that reduce risk and re-identification</li><li>Decision-making for consent, capacity, and involving guardians or gatekeepers</li><li>How participants raise concerns/complaints after participation (include contact details on information sheets and at session close)</li></ul><h3>3. Principles (proposed by</h3><p>We adopt a <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-definition-of-trauma-informed-practice/working-definition-of-trauma-informed-practice"">trauma-informed approach</a> and embed these principles into recruitment, consent, session design, data handling, analysis, and reporting:</p><ul><li>Safety (physical and psychological)</li><li>Accessibility (physical and remote)</li><li>Trustworthiness</li><li>Collaboration</li><li>Choice and transparency</li><li>Empowerment</li><li>Cultural considerations (including gender responsiveness)</li><li>Recognising where there may be a potential for re‑traumatisation, and preventing it</li></ul><h3>4.

Risk assessment (before fieldwork)</h3><p>Complete a safeguarding risk assessment for the topic, participant group, methods, and setting (in-person/remote). Use the risk matrix in Appendix A.</p><p><strong>At minimum, assess:</strong></p><ul><li>Sensitivity of topic and likelihood of triggering content</li><li>Participant vulnerability (age, disability, trauma exposure, dependency, power imbalance)</li><li>Setting risks (home visits, public spaces, care settings, online sessions)</li><li>Researcher exposure (secondary trauma, lone-working, travel, hostility)</li><li>Observers/note takers: their needs, triggers, and responsibilities (they’re part of the safeguarding environment too)</li><li>Data risks (identifiers, recordings, storage access, retention)</li><li>Third‑party risks (information about children/dependents/others)</li><li>Language and culture as barriers to participation; plan accordingly</li></ul><p><strong>Additional in-person fieldwork risks (especially post‑COVID):</strong></p><ul><li>Public health/infection-control risks (outbreaks, PPE/visitor rules, ventilation, hand hygiene)</li><li>Clinical/biohazard risks where applicable (follow site infection-control protocols/training)</li><li>Travel and fatigue risks (long days, commute safety, late finishes)</li><li>Environmental/neighbourhood risks (area safety, transport availability, accessibility, lone travel after dark)</li></ul><p><strong>High-security settings (prisons/secure hospitals):</strong></p><ul><li>restricted devices/recording, staff presence of in the sessions, coercion risk, emergency procedures, lockdown/incident response.</li></ul><p>Plan for a dynamic risk assessment on the day.</p><h3>6. Recruitment, screening, and participation support (including incentives)</h3><p>Recruitment must be voluntary, proportionate, and designed to avoid coercion.</p><ul><li>Use plain-language invitations and information sheets</li><li>Avoid recruiting via a person with direct power over the participant where possible (manager, teacher, clinician, prison staff). If unavoidable, add safeguards to protect voluntariness.</li><li>Screen for immediate risk: if a participant is in acute crisis, signpost support and do not proceed.</li><li>Plan accessible formats (easy-read, large print, multiple languages, captions)</li></ul><p>Incentives, reimbursement, and participation costs:</p><ul><li>Equity: consider reimbursement for expenses and costs of participation (including for staff, service users, or people in custody, subject to policy).</li><li>Document: amount, rationale, delivery route, timing, and what personal data is required to pay it.</li><li>Confirm host policies: e.g., whether staff can accept gifts, and prison rules on incentives.</li><li>Document potential issues: undue influence, misrepresentation, and how you’ll mitigate (neutral framing, ethical screening, opt‑out preserved).</li></ul><h3>7. Consent and capacity (adults, vulnerable adults, children)</h3><p>Consent is ongoing, informed, and freely given. Use staged consent for recordings, artefact review, and attribution. Reconfirm at key moments.</p><p>Operational note: don’t assume digital consent will work. Bring printed packs for in-person sessions, or allow time at the start of remote sessions to complete consent. Confirm verbally and record confirmation; have a second team member witness if required.</p><p>Table 3 shows a worked example of a decision pathway that you can adapt.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of a decision pathway for consent and assent."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mxrX5ynibKw3U7Cq3kghDw.png"" /><figcaption>Decision pathway for consent and assent. Screenshot by the author.</figcaption></figure><p>Capacity checks (use appropriate local framework):</p><ul><li>Explain in a way the person can understand (visuals/easy read as needed)</li><li>Check understanding (ask them to describe what will happen and their right to stop)</li><li>If they cannot understand/retain/weigh/communicate a decision even with support, do not take consent from them alone</li></ul><p>Provide complaints/concerns contact details on the info sheet and repeat at close.</p><h3>8. Participant safeguarding during sessions</h3><p>Build “safety by design” into every touchpoint.</p><p><strong>Baseline safeguards:</strong></p><ul><li>Content warnings and a plain-language roadmap</li><li>“Menu of participation” (topics, depth, mode, anonymity)</li><li>Choice throughout (breaks, camera off, written chat, skip questions)</li><li>Use redacted/synthetic artefacts by default</li><li>Normalise opting out without explanation</li><li>Support signposting at start and end</li><li>Avoid leading and probing language; also avoid pathologising terms</li><li>Close with a grounding option if useful</li></ul><p><strong>Remote-session enhancements:</strong></p><ul><li>Confirm participant is in a safe/private space; offer “switch topic” / “stop now” phrase</li><li>Collect emergency contacts only where needed</li><li>Use secure platforms; lock meetings; manage screen-sharing/chat safely</li><li>If using an AI tool to record for later notes and analysis, inform the participant. Build that into your consent forms</li><li>If remote observation is allowed, inform the participant. It’s unethical to allow a session to be watched by 10 observers via tools such as <a href=""https://info.heymarvin.com/marvin-ai-research-software-fe?utm_campaign_id=&amp;utm_term=marvin%20software&amp;utm_campaign=gs_cpc_brand_maxconv_kwds_marvin&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=2315755094&amp;hsa_cam=23058402392&amp;hsa_grp=186754625740&amp;hsa_ad=787418153179&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-344036103553&amp;hsa_kw=marvin%20software&amp;hsa_mt=e&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=23058402392&amp;gbraid=0AAAAApcRwVqn4UhpUqzsCm0IRRpNJaX_3&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAgvPKBhCxARIsAOlK_EqA5zmRIA3LuPAbVm0AL8IK5ScvprJuNTXpcqAO_6Juxk3zpnMLJg4aAqxCEALw_wcB"">Marvin</a> etc, while you introduced only one observer visible to the participant on MS Teams meeting.

We can take a break or switch topic. You’re in control, and it’s okay to skip anything. Here are support options if you’d like them.”</p><p><strong>Disclosure script:</strong><br />“I’m concerned this may relate to someone’s safety. I need to pass this to the safeguarding lead/DSL. I’ll note only what’s necessary and can help you contact them now.”</p><p><strong>Incident recording</strong>: minimum necessary facts, no interpretation, store securely.</p><h3>10.

<h4>We have decades of data proving design’s business value. So why do we still lose every budget fight?</h4><figure><img alt=""Abstract geometric illustration in Mondrian style with overlapping rectangles in red, blue, yellow and black, representing design frameworks and business structure"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_wRdyx0G_yje4RDYTxkNFw.png"" /><figcaption>Generated using Midjourney</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve watched it happen too many times. You spend weeks researching, prototyping, testing. The users love it. The data backs it. Then someone in the room says “I don’t like blue” or “my wife thinks this is confusing” and suddenly everything’s back on the table. Design decisions get discarded like they’re optional decorations, not strategic choices backed by evidence.</p><p>In most companies I’ve worked with, design is an afterthought. Something you add after the important decisions get made. Which means when budget cuts come, when timelines compress, when stakeholders disagree — design goes first. And the worst part? We stand there unable to articulate why that’s a mistake in terms anyone will listen to.</p><p>Here’s what makes this infuriating: <strong>the evidence that design creates business value is unambiguous</strong>. McKinsey studied 300 publicly listed companies over five years and found that top-quartile design performers achieved <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-business-value-of-design"">32% points higher revenue growth and 56% points higher total returns to shareholders</a>. The Design Management Institute tracked design-led companies for a decade and found they <a href=""https://fortune.com/2017/08/31/the-design-value-index-shows-what-design-thinking-is-worth/"">outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 211%</a>.</p><p>Yet design teams get cut disproportionately during layoffs. We lose budget allocation fights. We remain stuck in service organization roles while marketing and product management sit at the strategic table making decisions about what we’ll build.</p><p>The problem isn’t that design lacks value. The problem is that we — as a profession — never learned how to prove it in language that organizations understand.</p><p>And this isn’t about individual designers being bad at business. This is systemic. This is about how design professionalized, how design education evolved, and how the industry systematically failed to build business articulation capability into our DNA from the start.</p><p>John Maeda’s annual <a href=""https://designintech.report/"">Design in Tech reports</a> have tracked design’s rise in Silicon Valley for over a decade, documenting the evolution from “classical design” to “computational design.” His 2024 report carried an urgent warning: “Work Transformation Is Coming FAST” for design careers. Yet even as design’s technical capabilities expanded, its business legitimacy remained precarious.</p><h3>We inherited a philosophy that actively opposed commercial thinking</h3><p>The roots go deeper than you’d think. When Walter Gropius established the Bauhaus in 1919, he deliberately positioned design as an artistic and technical pursuit <em>opposed to</em> commercial concerns. The curriculum emphasized “form follows function” and workshop-based learning, but <a href=""https://novedge.com/blogs/design-news/design-software-history-the-influence-of-the-bauhaus-movement-on-the-evolution-of-design-software-and-its-lasting-legacy-in-modern-design-practices"">explicitly excluded business, history, and commercial context</a>.</p><p>This wasn’t neutral. It established a professional identity centered on craft excellence and creative autonomy — values that positioned designers as separate from commercial enterprise. When László Moholy-Nagy founded the New Bauhaus in Chicago in 1937 and Josef Albers joined Black Mountain College, they carried this DNA into American design education. The pattern replicated through Ulm, RISD, and eventually into the academic design programs that produce most professional designers today.</p><p>Mike Monteiro frames this inheritance bluntly in <a href=""https://www.designisajob.com""><em>Design Is a Job</em></a>: designers must understand they’re “running a business, not a hobby.” Yet this framing contradicts the very foundation of modern design education, which positioned commercial concerns as antithetical to craft excellence. While marketing departments in the 1950s-70s were learning to speak the language of ROI and revenue attribution, design schools were teaching students that commercial thinking corrupted creative integrity.</p><p>Nigel Cross’s influential 1982 paper <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Cross"">“Designerly Ways of Knowing”</a> cemented this separation by establishing design as a “third culture” distinct from both sciences and humanities. While this legitimized design academically, it also reinforced our distance from business disciplines. Cross positioned design cognition as fundamentally different from analytical thinking — valuable insight that inadvertently made cross-functional translation harder.</p><p><strong>Compare this to other professions</strong>. The <a href=""https://www.carnegiefoundation.org/about/who_we_are/our-legacy/"">Flexner Report of 1910</a> transformed medical education by standardizing training and establishing clear professional standards. The <a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1908453"">Carnegie Foundation’s subsequent studies</a> of law, medicine, and engineering identified a pattern: successful professional education combines technical skill with professional identity formation that includes service, responsibility, and yes — business reality.</p><p>Design education never underwent equivalent transformation. There was no Flexner Report for design. No moment of standardization that required business competency as part of becoming a professional designer.</p><p>So we learned to make beautiful things, thoughtful things, user-centered things. But nobody taught us how to defend them when someone asks “What’s the ROI?”</p><p>Design education’s failure to incorporate business competency isn’t new criticism. <a href=""https://jnd.org/why-design-education-must-change/"">Don Norman</a> — former Apple VP and author of The Design of Everyday Things — has spent decades advocating for educational reform. In his influential 2010 essay “Why Design Education Must Change,” Norman observed that designers often lack “requisite understanding” of behavioral sciences, technology, and business: “Design schools do not train students about these complex issues, about the interlocking complexities of human and social behavior.” His 2019 <a href=""https://www.futureofdesigneducation.org/about"">Future of Design Education</a> initiative with IBM’s Karel Vredenburg brought together 600+ volunteers to address the gap between <a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/90669651/inside-don-normans-herculean-quest-to-fix-design-education"">design education</a> and professional demands. Yet as Norman noted, “the vast majority of schools [remain] incredibly resistant, unable to change.”</p><figure><img alt=""Timeline comparing professionalization paths: Marketing (1950s-2010s), Product Management (1931–1998), Design (ongoing gap in business education)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9VCLeyxHTdJjROHLjdWUBw.png"" /><figcaption>Source: Author</figcaption></figure><h3>Meanwhile, marketing and product management learned the language of power</h3><p>Understanding why design gets marginalized requires looking at how other functions earned their strategic seats. The histories of marketing and product management reveal paths we haven’t followed.</p><p>Marketing’s strategic ascent took decades. In the 1950s, marketing existed primarily as advertising coordination. By the 1970s, marketers at companies like Procter &amp; Gamble had assumed profit-and-loss responsibility — a critical legitimizing move that forced financial accountability. The CMO title appeared in the 1990s, and by the 2010s, <a href=""https://hbr.org/2017/07/the-evolution-of-the-cmo"">marketing led digital activities in 92% of companies</a>.</p><p>The key transition? Marketers learned to speak in revenue attribution, customer acquisition cost, lifetime value — the language finance already understood.</p><p>Product management’s rise is even more instructive. The role started with Neil McElroy’s 1931 “Brand Man” memo at Procter &amp; Gamble, defining someone responsible for tracking sales and driving business outcomes. When Bill Hewlett and David Packard adapted this at HP in the 1940s, they created the modern product manager as “voice of the customer internally.”</p><p>But the decisive framing came from <a href=""https://hbr.org/2017/07/the-evolution-of-the-cmo"">Ben Horowitz’s 1998 memo “Good Product Manager/Bad Product Manager,”</a> which positioned PMs as “CEO of the product” — explicitly claiming strategic accountability rather than coordination responsibility.</p><p>Sociologist Andrew Abbott’s “The System of Professions” (1988) provides the framework for understanding these trajectories. Abbott argues that professions compete over “jurisdictions” — claims of ownership over expert knowledge. A profession gains legitimacy through diagnosis (classifying problems), inference (applying knowledge), and treatment (implementing solutions).</p><p>Marketing claimed the customer relationship jurisdiction. Product management claimed product success jurisdiction.</p><p>What jurisdiction has design claimed that executives recognize as strategically essential?</p><p><a href=""https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amr.1995.9508080331"">Mark Suchman’s legitimacy research</a> (Academy of Management Review, 1995) identifies three forms: pragmatic (“What can you do for me?”), moral (normative approval), and cognitive (taken-for-grantedness). Cognitive legitimacy is most powerful but rarest.</p><p>Marketing and product management have achieved cognitive legitimacy in most organizations — their presence at strategic discussions is assumed. Design remains trapped at pragmatic level, constantly having to prove immediate utility.</p><figure><img alt=""Comparison table showing Marketing, Product Management, Engineering, and Design across jurisdiction claims, metrics used, and legitimacy status"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YZA01jEzLvsDqEuM6shK5w.png"" /><figcaption>Source: Author</figcaption></figure><h3>The metrics we use don’t connect to decisions executives make</h3><p>Here’s where the disconnect gets concrete. Designers measure experience quality: task completion rates, System Usability Scale scores, Net Promoter Score, user satisfaction surveys.</p><p>These metrics measure something real. But as <a href=""https://businessofsoftware.org/talks/design-metrics-matter-jared-spool/"">Jared Spool observed</a>: “The metrics out of the box didn’t help us one little bit. They just created confusion.”</p><p>The problem isn’t that NPS or SUS are invalid. It’s that they exist in a different causal chain than executive decision-making. Look at the structure:</p><p><strong>Marketing:</strong> Revenue attribution → Direct (clicks → purchases)<br /><strong>Engineering:</strong> Delivery metrics → Direct (code → features)<br /><strong>Design:</strong> Experience quality → <strong>Indirect</strong> (experience → satisfaction → loyalty → <em>maybe</em> revenue)</p><p>Marketing demonstrates that campaign X generated Y dollars through clear attribution. Engineering demonstrates that sprint Z delivered features A, B, C. Design demonstrates that usability improved by some percentage — and then <em>hopes</em> executives connect this to business outcomes.</p><p>Design leader <a href=""https://www.petermerholz.com/blog/design-leadership-truisms/"">Peter Merholz</a> captured this fundamental tension in his Design Leadership Truisms: “YOU CANNOT CALCULATE AN ROI FOR DESIGN.” This isn’t defeatism — it’s acknowledgment that design’s impact is diffuse, systemic, and resistant to the neat attribution models that executives expect.</p><p>Research from behavioral economics explains why this indirection kills influence. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK593518/"">Kahneman and Tversky’s prospect theory</a> established that people weigh losses approximately twice as heavily as equivalent gains. <a href=""https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/introduction-behavioral-economics/"">Thaler’s mental accounting research</a> showed that people categorize money into different mental buckets with different decision rules.</p><p>The implication: design investments positioned as abstract improvements compete poorly against investments positioned as loss prevention or direct revenue generation.</p><p>The <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-business-value-of-design"">McKinsey Design Index study</a> quantified this disconnect: <strong>over 40% of surveyed companies don’t talk to end users during development</strong>, and <strong>less than 5% reported that their leaders could make objective design decisions</strong>. Design isn’t measured with the same rigor as time and costs — and designers “have not always embraced design metrics or actively shown management how their designs tie to meeting business goals.”</p><p>Even NPS itself is crumbling. According to <a href=""https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/wasnt-nps-supposed-to-be-all-but-gone-this-year/"">CMSWire’s 2025 analysis</a>, NPS fell from second-most popular CX metric in 2023 to eighth place in 2024. Only 23% of U.S. enterprise CX leaders now use it. The metric’s critics note weak correlation to actual behavior, lack of diagnostic capability, and score volatility — problems that make it unreliable for executive decisions even when designers treat it as gospel.</p><p>We’re speaking a language executives don’t use to make decisions. And then we’re surprised when our arguments don’t land.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hHL2Akev5ssuu-DcrsPrPA.png"" /><figcaption>Created using Midjourney.</figcaption></figure><h3>Real layoffs reveal the cost of not knowing how to defend our worth</h3><p>The consequences manifest most visibly during organizational stress. <a href=""https://www.quarterinchhole.com/p/how-the-layoffs-have-impacted-ux"">Lawton Pybus’s analysis of 2022–2024 tech layoffs</a>, tracking 5,521 laid-off employees across 12 companies, found that while engineers made up the largest share of layoffs in absolute numbers, <strong>when adjusted for team size</strong>, designers were cut at 1.7 times the expected rate, and researchers at three times the expected rate. In other words: design and research teams were disproportionately targeted.</p><p>The UX Collective’s 2024 State of UX report, authored by <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-state-of-ux-in-2024-enter-late-stage-ux-e9b403b67667"">Fabricio Teixeira</a> and <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/why-designers-quit-2023-report-24dae87d7896"">Caio Braga</a>, identified what they call “late-stage UX” — comparing the current industry state to late-stage capitalism. Their analysis of over 1,000 articles from 2023 found design characterized by “market saturation, heavy focus on financial growth, commoditization, automation, and increased financialization.” Designers can now only push so far when advocating for user needs against corporate influence. Matej Latin’s 2023 survey of 293 designers found that 14.3% were laid off — a staggering increase from 2022, when layoffs weren’t significant enough to track.</p><p>Indeed’s job posting data showed UX Research positions decreased <strong>89%</strong> from their 2022 peak to January 2024.</p><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/why-is-the-ux-job-market-such-a-mess-right-now-a-comprehensive-explanation-97d5588696fd"">Jared Spool</a>, in his January 2024 analysis “Why is the UX job market such a mess right now?”, pushed back on the myth that UX was disproportionately targeted: “There’s no evidence to support this. When Meta laid off 21,000 people in 2022 and 2023, a few hundred were UX people… UX people were never more than a small proportion of the total people let go.” Yet this statistical nuance provides cold comfort — whether designers were targeted specifically or caught in broader cuts, the result remains: design teams shrinking, roles disappearing, and a profession unable to articulate why this is strategically catastrophic.</p><p>Google Cloud’s October 2025 layoffs cut 100+ design-related positions, with some design teams reduced by half. The pattern repeats: when cost-cutting pressures intensify, design becomes expendable because its contribution remains unquantified.</p><p>I’ve seen this up close. Talented designers with years of institutional knowledge, cut because nobody could articulate their business value in the thirty seconds it took finance to scan the headcount spreadsheet.</p><p><strong>Intuit’s 2007 Design for Delight launch</strong> illustrates how articulation failures play out even with executive support.

He <a href=""https://designobserver.com/making-change-the-product-phil-gilbert-on-transforming-ibm-from-the-inside-out/"">created internal “brand”</a> by avoiding preconceived terms: “I could either change 400,000 minds, or create a concept that meant nothing at IBM and define it ourselves.”</p><p>He made design services something teams paid for, creating demand rather than mandating adoption. He secured CEO sponsorship (Ginni Rometty).

Kerry Rodden, Hilary Hutchinson, and Xin Fu developed HEART in their 2010 CHI conference paper “<a href=""https://research.google/pubs/measuring-the-user-experience-on-a-large-scale-user-centered-metrics-for-web-applications/"">Measuring the User Experience on a Large Scale: User-Centered Metrics for Web Applications</a>,” specifically to fill the gap between small-scale qualitative observations and large-scale automated measurement.</p><p>Google uses it internally across products. The Gmail “undo send” feature emerged from <a href=""https://www.lyssna.com/blog/google-heart-framework/"">happiness metrics tracking</a>.</p><p>Jared Spool’s outcome-driven metrics, detailed in his famous “<a href=""https://articles.centercentre.com/three_hund_million_button/"">$300 Million Button</a>” case study, focus on “problem-value metrics” — quantifying UX obstacles in dollar terms. An e-commerce company identified checkout failures through usability testing, created a custom metric (“unrealized shopping cart value from password issues”), implemented guest checkout, and recovered $300 million annually.</p><p>The metric framing transformed “registration causes friction” into financial language executives understood. Spool’s principle: “Surface the cost of not removing obstacles — this gives executives a perspective about UX they’ve never had before.”</p><p><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/calculating-roi-design-projects/""><strong>Nielsen Norman Group’s ROI framework</strong></a> attempts direct financial calculation, though they appropriately note that “ROI calculations are strategic exercises to help you conceptualize the relative value of design projects. They are not financial projections.”</p><p>The methodology: identify specific business metrics affected (revenue, cost savings, productivity), establish baseline and target values, calculate investment cost, project time to achieve targets, and compute ROI.</p><p><strong>Les Binet and Peter Field’s advertising effectiveness research</strong> offers lessons from a discipline that solved its measurement problem.

This problem is systemic. Solutions must be too.</p><p><strong>Design education must incorporate business competency as core requirement.</strong> The <a href=""https://carey.jhu.edu/explore-carey-mba/design-leadership"">Johns Hopkins/MICA Design Leadership MA/MBA</a> and <a href=""https://id.iit.edu/graduate-school/master-of-design-mba/"">IIT Institute of Design MDes/MBA</a> programs exist because the market recognizes this gap. But such programs remain exceptions.</p><p>Mainstreaming business literacy into undergraduate and bootcamp design education would address the problem at source.</p><p><strong>Professional organizations must build measurement infrastructure.</strong> Shared databases of design effectiveness case studies, common metrics frameworks, longitudinal research programs would provide the evidential base we currently lack. The <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-business-value-of-design"">McKinsey Design Index</a> and <a href=""https://fortune.com/2017/08/31/the-design-value-index-shows-what-design-thinking-is-worth/"">DMI Design Value Index</a> demonstrate the concept’s power.</p><p><strong>Designers must learn to speak both languages</strong> without abandoning native expertise. This isn’t about becoming business people who do some design. It’s about developing boundary-spanning capability that research identifies as critical for cross-functional influence.</p><p><strong>Organizations investing in design must create structural legitimacy.</strong> IBM’s transformation worked because Gilbert built organizational infrastructure — not just because IBM hired designers. Design Program Offices, certification programs, embedded teams, executive sponsorship.</p><p>And for those of us in the trenches right now?</p><p>Start translating. Every design recommendation you make, every research finding you present — ask yourself: “How would I frame this in terms of revenue, cost reduction, or risk mitigation?”</p><p>It feels reductive at first. It feels like we’re reducing craft to spreadsheets.</p><p>But here’s the thing: the alternative is watching your best work get discarded because someone in the room didn’t like the color blue.</p><h3>The paradox we need to resolve</h3><p>Jodi Rae, when creating the Design Value Index, captured design’s fundamental challenge: “People who are convinced of the value of design are not interested in quantifying it. The CEOs in all of the DVI companies already understand the power of design… Those most interested in quantifying the value of design are the financial people, which shows they don’t really understand the power of design.”</p><p>This paradox isn’t inevitable. It’s the predictable outcome of a profession that built exceptional craft capability while neglecting business articulation capability.</p><p>The good news? This problem is structural, not inherent.</p><p>Marketing learned to prove ROI. Product management learned to claim strategic accountability. HR learned to speak in financial terms. Data science learned to demonstrate decision impact.</p><p>Each discipline underwent professionalization transitions that design has yet to complete.</p><p>The research suggests this transition is achievable — but requires coordinated action: education reform, professional infrastructure, organizational change, individual development.</p><p>We’re not the cause of this problem. But we’re positioned to catalyze its solution.</p><p>Design’s business value is empirically demonstrated. The task now is building the professional infrastructure to articulate it — to translate craft excellence into language that organizational decision-making recognizes and rewards.</p><p>Because the alternative is watching another generation of talented designers get laid off while someone in finance looks at a spreadsheet and decides design is optional.</p><p>It’s not. And it’s time we learned how to prove it.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=79f2e7d59c8b"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/when-your-best-work-gets-tossed-79f2e7d59c8b"">When your best work gets tossed</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>How researchers can define quality, guide prompts, and shape the value of AI outputs.</h4><p>AI agents, synthetic users, deep research, staying relevant as a UX researcher can feel like a challenge that resets every week. Teams across product, design, and engineering are moving faster than ever, often powered by the same underlying AI technologies. <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/human-machine-responsible-ai-workflows-for-ux-research-22a5c39ac0ec"">Prompt engineering and system design have quickly become central topics across disciplines</a>, raising a familiar, and uncomfortable, question: <em>where does UX research fit now?</em></p><p>My experience building LLM-based products over the past two years has led me to a clear conclusion. This moment is not the end of UX research. It is the same work we have always done, understanding people, defining value, but applied to a new class of systems. And for researchers willing to adapt, it creates an opportunity to move upstream and become more strategic than ever. As products become cheaper to build and AI spreads across nearly every workflow, teams now face a new foundational decision: how much AI should this feature contain?</p><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/is-your-ai-use-case-idea-really-going-to-work-7718c695e7c0"">When the answer is “yes”, and it is not always</a>, the work does not stop there. A second, equally important question follows: <em>what form should that AI take?</em> One of the most prescient frameworks in this space comes from <a href=""https://www.emcap.com/thoughts/your-success-with-generative-ai-may-come-down-to-these-ux-decisions"">Jake Saper and Jessica Cohen at Emergence Capital, who describe AI products along a spectrum</a>. On one end are pure chat-based systems that maximize flexibility. On the other are AI-enhanced features that trade flexibility for simplicity. Most production features live closer to the latter. The product defines the prompt, sometimes with light user input, and delivers the output in a predetermined format. Every “summarize,” “rewrite,” or “generate” button we encounter today reflects this tradeoff.</p><p>Delivering value with AI enhanced features means having a solid understanding of what the user is attempting to achieve within the context of their workflow both for the actual output and the design of how it is delivered. Take for example, a summarize feature. A summary can mean many different things depending on where it is being delivered. A “Summarize” button offered in Gmail likely needs punchy and bulleted contents. The same within Adobe acrobat for a large PDF could mean a multi paragraph executive summary. It is all about context and the actual need in the moment. The same we have always been doing but new.</p><figure><img alt=""Adobe buttons for taking AI Actions"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/774/1*lYL-7x1LLVuJ-LBP0ey62w.png"" /><figcaption>Adobe buttons for taking AI Actions</figcaption></figure><p>NotebookLM offers a compelling example of this shift. The product began as a chat-based, retrieval-augmented system. It gained widespread attention with its audio overview feature, which generated a podcast-style summary of a user’s materials, no prompting required. That feature delivered immediate, differentiated value by meeting a specific user need in a novel format. While the initial novelty has faded, subsequent updates have reinforced NotebookLM’s position as a model for AI-enhanced productivity.</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of the NotebookLM feature including sources, the overview page, and the studio feature."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5e0Ox6q7MpceIhZjBBiXBw.png"" /><figcaption>A screenshot of the NotebookLM feature including sources, the overview page, and the studio features</figcaption></figure><p>The Studio feature set within NotebookLM illustrates the pattern particularly well. Users are presented with a set of structured options that guide them toward generating reports, briefs, or analyses. The real power lies not in unrestricted chat, but in the ability to lightly customize a pre-generated prompt. In Emergence Capital’s terms, this is a true copilot: a system that helps users provide the right input in order to receive a valuable output. When a user asks NotebookLM to generate a report, success is not defined by grammatical correctness or factual accuracy alone. Success is whether the output fits the user’s actual need, whether it advances their task, supports their workflow, or deepens their understanding.</p><p>This is where the role of UX research begins to change… not in kind, but in scope.</p><h3>A New Way to Create Value</h3><p>Creating value with LLM-based features is not about writing the cleverest prompt. It is about defining the right instructions so the system produces something that is genuinely useful to the user in that moment. Prompt quality matters, but prompts do not exist in a vacuum. They sit at the intersection of engineering, design, and, critically, research.</p><p>NotebookLM’s opening chat response is a useful example. As a user logs in, the chat window is filled with an overview of all contents that helps users make sense of their materials as soon as they open a notebook, reducing the cognitive cost of re-orienting themselves. Engineering work was required to craft prompts that reliably surface the right insights. Design work was required to decide how that information should appear on the page. But neither of those efforts can succeed without first understanding what users actually need at the moment of entry. That understanding is where research does its most important work, informing both what the system should generate and how that output should be presented.</p><figure><img alt=""NotebookLM opens with a summary of the Notebooks"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Hk912CHJxIPta3jysWeUEg.png"" /><figcaption>NotebookLM opens with a summary of the Notebooks</figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/ai-ux-design-for-intelligent-interfaces-bc966e96107d"">Design guidance for displaying AI-generated content is relatively well covered.</a> <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/search?q=ai+in+product"">Many strong frameworks already exist for structuring text, surfacing key information, and presenting outputs in ways that are readable and actionable.</a> What has received far less attention is the upstream work of shaping the instructions that guide generation in the first place. Ensuring a prompt is directionally correct — aligned to real user needs rather than abstract capabilities, was always important. With LLMs, it becomes foundational.</p><p>This is where UX research creates new leverage. By engaging early, researchers can help teams anchor feature development in what is actually possible given both the state of the technology and the user’s needs in context. In my experience, this approach consistently opens up more promising product directions. Instead of retrofitting research onto an already-defined solution, teams start with a shared understanding of value, giving design and engineering a clearer target to aim for as they build.</p><h3>A New Process for Defining Quality in Outputs</h3><p>For decades, UX research has focused on identifying the user needs a product must satisfy. That part of the work is unchanged. What <em>is</em> new is the nature of the systems we are designing. With large language models, teams no longer have complete control over outputs. These systems are inherently non-deterministic, we can guide them, but we cannot fully dictate what they will produce.</p><p>In traditional product design, many needs could be satisfied with deterministic solutions. When Apple realized people were using their iPhones as flashlights, the solution was straightforward: a single button that produced a single, predictable outcome. One tap, immediate value. No ambiguity, no interpretation required. That model works well when the need is simple and the desired outcome is clear.</p><figure><img alt=""iPhone flashlight buttons that is placed on the Lock Screen for ease of use"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*WDyogOfVTb78FQwo"" /><figcaption>iPhone flashlight buttons that is placed on the Lock Screen for ease of use</figcaption></figure><p>As needs become more complex, so does the solution. Uber faced a different problem: passengers felt anxious while waiting for their ride. The company could not control the behavior of individual drivers, so instead it designed an experience to manage uncertainty. <a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/uber-algorithm-fake/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">A live map showed the driver’s progress (although not always truthfully)</a>. Messaging explained potential delays. Contact options gave users a sense of agency. Each element addressed the same underlying issue, negative sentiment during the wait, even though the core system remained unpredictable.</p><figure><img alt=""A screen grab of a car moving toward a destination on Uber App"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*SrfQbAaDBqm8Gh6H"" /><figcaption>A screen grab of a car moving toward a destination on Uber App</figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://medium.com/ai-ux-designers/ai-is-breaking-free-an-emerging-ai-ux-pattern-26894a915d93"">Working with LLMs is similar, but amplified</a>. An LLM behaves less like a traditional interface and more like a human collaborator: responsive, capable, and inconsistent. It may produce insightful results one moment and confident-sounding nonsense the next. This unpredictability is not a flaw; it is a property of the technology. The challenge, then, is not eliminating variability, but maximizing output quality despite it.</p><p>That challenge requires a different approach. Rather than treating quality as an after-the-fact judgment, teams must define what “good” looks like in advance, and do so in a way that acknowledges uncertainty. This is where UX research plays a central role: translating user needs into clear quality signals that can guide generation, evaluation, and ongoing refinement, even when outputs cannot be fully controlled. Here is how I got about it.</p><h4>Surfacing Quality Signals</h4><p>The first step is establishing a shared understanding of what constitutes a high-quality experience. When a user requests a briefing document in NotebookLM, what are they actually expecting to see? The answer is inherently subjective. Different users bring different expectations, shaped by their goals, context, and prior experience.</p><p>This is why qualitative research is essential. In-depth interviews allow teams to understand not just <em>what</em> users say they want, but <em>how</em> they judge AI-generated outputs in practice. I start by asking users to share what they expect to see as an output. Afterwards, I walk them through examples, either outputs they already use or ones I introduce, and have them describe what they mean when they say something “informs,” “summarizes,” or “provides direction.” These conversations reveal the mental models users bring to AI systems and the tradeoffs they are willing to make.</p><p>As classic Jobs to Be Done research has shown, people are rarely asking for features in the abstract, they are trying to make progress in a specific situation. The same principle applies here. With that mindset, research becomes a game of identifying the main themes in what users are asking for in the output.</p><p>In the case of NotebookLM, early qualitative work might surface themes such as trust, cognitive relief, contextual relevance, and actionability. Users may not articulate all of these dimensions explicitly, but patterns emerge across interviews. A useful heuristic here is the 80/20 rule: a relatively small set of research-derived criteria can account for the majority of users’ expectations.</p><p>For example, a high-quality briefing report in Notebook might be judged on whether it:</p><ul><li>Feels trustworthy</li><li>Demonstrates understanding across multiple sources</li><li>Reflects the user’s current context</li><li>Connects insights to realistic next actions</li></ul><h4>Validation and Refinement</h4><p>Once core quality themes are identified, the next step is validation and refinement at scale. Surveys are particularly effective here. They allow teams to translate high-level themes into more specific, testable factors and to understand how consistently those factors matter across users and contexts. When designing these studies, I ask participants to evaluate outputs that closely resemble what the product would actually generate. Users are then asked to rate and critique those outputs, providing nuance around what makes them useful, or not.</p><p>Take trust as an example. Users frequently say they want AI outputs they can trust, but trust is not a single, universal attribute. At a minimum, it implies factual correctness. Beyond that, trust is shaped by tone, length, structure, and framing, all of which vary by context. <a href=""https://medium.com/%40mariamargarida/designing-with-ai-ux-considerations-and-best-practices-5c6b69b92c4c"">An email summary should be concise and direct. An executive briefing should surface key themes and unexpected insights.</a> A call recap should highlight action items and mention relevant stakeholders. When an output matches what users expect in that situation, trust follows.</p><p>Surveys help teams refine these distinctions. In the NotebookLM case, researchers might explore when users feel a pre-created executive briefing demonstrates contextual awareness and when it does not. For example, users may respond positively when recent meetings or emails are incorporated appropriately, and negatively when outdated or irrelevant documents are surfaced. This level of specificity is critical, it directly informs how prompts should be written and constrained.</p><h4>Creating a Quality Rubric</h4><p>With qualitative depth and survey validation in place, the next step is synthesizing insights into a shared quality rubric. There is an immediate opportunity for the engineering team to create refinement, yet as previously suggested, it is not just about the actual output but how it is designed. As such, this rubric can become the centering focus for the entire team.</p><p>A well-designed rubric defines each quality factor clearly, illustrates what good and poor outputs look like, and makes tradeoffs explicit. It allows designers, product managers, and engineers to align on what success means and how it should be evaluated. Importantly, it translates research insights into something actionable.</p><p>For prompt engineers, the rubric serves as a definition of the <strong>global maximum</strong>, the set of characteristics the system should optimize for overall. Prompt iteration can then focus on finding local maxima within that boundary, confident that improvements are aligned with real user needs rather than proxy metrics.</p><figure><img alt=""Example of Metric Rubric for NotebookLM"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*r0e7MNnSxTo_jHMxDAVlug.png"" /><figcaption>EXAMPLE: NotebookLM Summary Output Quality Rubric</figcaption></figure><h4>Continued Refinement</h4><p>Even with a strong rubric and well-crafted prompts, the work does not end. Many teams now rely on AI-based testing and automated evaluation to refine LLM outputs over time. Companies such as <a href=""https://www.braintrust.dev/"">BrainTrust</a> have built extensive platforms that allow product teams to test the output of their prompts at scale, across models. Leveraging these tools are far more effective when grounded in research-defined quality criteria.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of the Braintrust app, showing evals at scale."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ci85QVqGfpeeBUbeWFYSlw.png"" /><figcaption>Braintrust has an extensive automated evaluation system</figcaption></figure><p>A solid rubric ensures that synthetic user testing, automated scoring, and iterative refinement are anchored in metrics that matter to real people. Rather than optimizing loosely connected signals, teams can focus on outcomes that genuinely improve the user experience.</p><p>This ongoing refinement is especially important in a fast-moving market. User expectations are evolving quickly as the Overton window of what is possible with AI continues to shift. A bullet-point summary that felt impressive yesterday may be table stakes today, replaced by audio, visual, or personalized formats tomorrow. Quality rubrics must be revisited and updated as expectations change, creating a sustained, strategic role for UX research in keeping AI systems aligned with human value.</p><h3>UX Research as the Interpreter of Human Value</h3><p>The science of UX research has not changed. People are still complex, contextual, and inconsistent, and understanding what they need remains the core of the work. The methods have not changed either. UX researchers are still experts at learning from users, identifying patterns, and translating insight into action.</p><p>What <em>has</em> changed is the nature of the systems we are shaping. With LLM-based products, outputs are no longer guaranteed, and a new stakeholder, the prompt engineer, has entered the room. <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/a-practitioners-journal-on-navigating-ux-in-the-age-of-ai-97f0a11e8319"">Research now has a direct line into how AI systems are instructed, evaluated, and scaled.</a> Insights no longer stop at informing interfaces or features; they define the criteria by which machine-generated work is judged as successful.</p><p>This process is not foreign to UX research, but the leverage it creates is new. By defining quality up front, researchers can shape how intelligence itself is tuned, guiding optimization, grounding automation, and ensuring that faster iteration does not come at the expense of human value. In my own work, this shift has made the field feel more relevant and more exciting than it has in years.</p><p>Done well, UX research can become the discipline that defines what people want from AI systems, and holds those systems accountable to real outcomes. AI will continue to do more of the work. That is not changing. What can change is whether that work actually matters. UX research is uniquely positioned to make sure it does.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=36285d007845"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/same-same-but-new-ux-research-in-the-age-of-llms-36285d007845"">Same, but new: UX Research in the age of LLMs</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>From chat to canvas to control panel: Understanding natural language interaction patterns</h4><figure><img alt=""Soft, misty background with a blurred human face profile on the right and the heading “Natural Language Interaction Patterns” on the left, accompanied by pill-shaped labels reading Intent, Action, and Orchestration."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GNkosiM1Eioj63cPsN-qMg.png"" /></figure><p>For much of the history of software, users had to build a mental model of the system before they could use it effectively. You learned where things lived like which menu contained which action, which screen held which information, how different parts of the interface connected to each other.</p><p>Interaction followed a structured pattern: navigate screens by clicking buttons, type into fields, scroll through content, use gestures, menus, or keyboard shortcuts to move between states. Every action required first understanding the system’s organizational logic, then locating the right control, and finally performing the correct interaction on it. Users translated what they wanted into a series of UI interactions the system understood.</p><p>While <em>affordance</em> was explicit, <em>intent</em> was indirect.</p><h3>When systems begin to understand intent</h3><p>As natural language based interaction to machine evolves, they didn’t just change how we express intent, they fundamentally compress entire workflows into single expressions.</p><p>For instance, Google search transformed how we find information precisely because it eliminated the directory-browsing model of early web portals.</p><figure><img alt=""Image comparing two navigation approaches. At the top, a hierarchical categories flow shows stacked panels moving left to right: Technology → Software → Operating System → Linux, with each selection highlighted in blue and arrows indicating deeper navigation. At the bottom, a single search bar labeled “Direct Natural Language Search” shows the query “latest news on linux OS,” illustrating direct access without navigating categories."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4CH_JqrSYUIkVUtYkLu8DQ.png"" /></figure><p>The system becomes responsible for translating that intent into the underlying sequence of actions, queries, and transformations.</p><p>This transformation fundamentally changes the contract between user and tool. Traditional interfaces required users to learn the system’s language, its navigation patterns, its terminology, its organizational logic. Natural language interfaces require the system to learn the user’s language instead.</p><h4>The Agent Shift: From understanding intent to executing work</h4><p>Modern AI interfaces extend this principle even further. Where Google compressed <em>navigation</em>, AI systems compress <em>action</em>, as Ben Shneiderman explores in his work on <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3419764"">bridging the gap between ethics and practice in human-centered AI</a>.</p><p>Plus, typing into a message box in natural language to converse with a system is straightforward, much like sending a text message. This familiarity lowers the entry barrier dramatically, making powerful AI tools immediately accessible to non-experts. And made tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Microsoft Copilot etc achieved mainstream adoption with remarkable speed.</p><h4>The conversation feed overload problem</h4><p>These conversation feed-based AI tools excel at expressing intent and getting relatively straightforward answers with better multi-turn controls. But the conversation feed can become overloaded when tasks involve multiple subsequent actions, require human intervention at various steps, or produce persistent artifacts that need to remain visible or outcomes become duplicative and longer. The linear nature of conversation thread often struggles to accommodate these complexities.</p><figure><img alt=""Animated GIF showing a user scrolling through a ChatGPT conversation feed in dark mode, revealing structured sections with headings, bullet points, and to convey longer message chains."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0vGE_GTPNE1cECtP1Y2xNw.gif"" /></figure><p>Different tools are responding to this tension:</p><ul><li>Some keep everything in the chat thread, treating code and documents as just another message</li><li>Others split the experience entirely, placing all output in a dedicated canvas</li><li>A few blend both approaches, using conversation for steering while the canvas holds the work</li></ul><p>This question of AI placement in UI design, which Sharang Sharma explored in his <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/where-should-ai-sit-in-your-ui-1710a258390e"">article</a>, becomes increasingly critical as these tools mature. The rest of this article covers observations from industry AI tools using different natural language-based interaction patterns, how they align with key aspects of interaction elements, and what we can learn if we want to build natural language-driven features, products, or systems.</p><h3>Natural language as an interaction medium</h3><p>When examining natural language interfaces through the lens of interaction design, Don Norman’s concept of the <a href=""https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262525671/the-design-of-everyday-things/"">Gulf of Execution and Gulf of Evaluation</a> provides a powerful framework for understanding how interaction loop with natural language work in these tools.</p><p><em>The Gulf of Execution</em> represents the gap between what a user intends to do and the actions required to execute it in the interface.</p><p><em>The Gulf of Evaluation </em>represents the gap between what the system does and the user’s understanding of that outcome.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram illustrating Norman’s action cycle with two loops. From “User Goal,” the top execution path flows through Identify Intention → Identify Actions → Execute in Interface → Interface. The bottom evaluation path flows from Interface Output → Interpretation → Evaluation back to User Goal, labeled as the Gulf of Execution (top) and Gulf of Evaluation (bottom)."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jK0bzL1YdrRarBHK55o7nA.png"" /></figure><p>For natural language driven interaction, instead of manually identifying and executing interface actions, users express intent directly through language. The system handles the translation from intention to action to execution. Instead of piecing together what happened from interface changes, users receive feedback in natural language, visual outputs, or a combination of both, making interpretation and evaluation more direct.</p><p>However, the effectiveness of this approach depends on how the interface distributes these interactions across different spaces.</p><p>Across existing tools that I’ve come across, I notice several patterns in how natural language bridges these gulfs. I’ve summarized three of them based on where execution happens and where evaluation takes place.</p><h4><strong>Pattern 1: Natural language interface as primary workspace</strong></h4><p>This pattern makes the <em>conversation itself the main workspace</em>, where the user expresses intent entirely in natural language and the system generates outputs in the same thread. It treats the chat as the central place for input, execution, and results along with persistent message history.</p><figure><img alt=""Four-panel comparison of AI assistant interfaces displayed in a grid, each showing long-form, structured responses in dark mode, including bullet points, headings, tables, and search-based results. Order of tools (top left to bottom right): ChatGPT, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8tCUXqcI03M3zRrcAYIrpQ.png"" /><figcaption>Side-by-side view of AI assistants: <a href=""https://chatgpt.com/"">ChatGPT</a>, <a href=""https://gemini.google.com/app"">Gemini</a>, <a href=""https://copilot.microsoft.com/"">Microsoft Copilot</a>, and <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/"">Perplexity</a></figcaption></figure><p>Both gulfs are bridged entirely within the same conversational space. You express what you want in the chat, the system executes, and you evaluate the results all in the same thread. The entire interaction loop lives in the conversation. Your journey can end there, or you move forward into a different tool to continue the work.</p><p><strong><em>Things to be aware of</em>: </strong>Users can express broad intent easily, but they have <em>limited fine-grained control</em> over how outputs are produced, and refining results still relies on more natural language rather than precise edits. Also Piras documents <a href=""https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/02/designing-ai-beyond-conversational-interfaces/"">how conversational interfaces, while seemingly intuitive, introduce usability challenges</a> designers solved decades ago in GUI design. The “blank page problem” remains acute: users often don’t know what to type to get ideal output, and the burden of articulating intent shifts entirely to the user.</p><h4><strong>Pattern 2: Natural language interface as contextual action block</strong></h4><p>Contextual input area, not a full chat interface. A natural language input component appears near your selection or as a menu option</p><figure><img alt=""Four-panel grid showing AI-assisted creation across different tools: Figma with an “Describe your edit” prompt, Notion with inline AI writing suggestions, Photoshop with a generative image fill prompt over a blurred image, and Wispr Flow displaying voice dictation converting speech into text."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*64GJWusQ_N1eIgdBjb3aXw.png"" /><figcaption>AI-assisted workflows across <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7373707174193156096/"">Figma</a>, <a href=""https://www.notion.com/help/guides/notion-ai-for-docs"">Notion</a>, <a href=""https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/generative-fill.html"">Photoshop</a>, and <a href=""https://wisprflow.ai/"">Wispr Flow</a></figcaption></figure><p>Gulf of execution happens through language interface, but gulf of evaluation happens visually on the canvas. There’s typically no conversation history in this space (can be stored and displayed in different interface seciton), each prompt is a fresh, contextual interaction. The canvas remains the primary work surface; natural language is just another input method within your existing workflow. This pattern often references context implicitly, bundling related information into single commands which Tang terms “<a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/emerging-interaction-patterns-in-generative-ai-experiences-8c351bb3392a"">context bundling</a>” to reduce typing burden while preserving</p><p><strong><em>Things to be aware of</em>: </strong>Pattern 2 treats each language prompt as a discrete action command tied to the workspace . For example, “summarize this selection” or “generate chart from this table”. This mean the pattern often reference context implicitly. it often struggles to integrate rich external context (like files, multiple references, or tool chains) and doesn’t naturally support deep follow-up refinement through language alone.</p><h4>Pattern 3: Natural language interface as control panel</h4><p>Having a persistent conversational panel alongside a workspace helps with iterative refinement and visibility of results. This dedicated chat composer provides a full, persistent conversational interface with message history. The system interprets the request, plans a sequence of actions from the converstation panel and executes them in a separate workspace</p><figure><img alt=""Four-panel screenshot showing an AI-assisted development workflow: Cursor AI editing a React/TypeScript codebase with inline suggestions, and OpenAI ChatGPT Atlas in agent mode executing tasks"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aA7XTemjn2iJ5Hzlw80cHg.png"" /><figcaption>Agent-driven workflows using <a href=""https://cursor.com/agents"">Cursor AI </a>and OpenAI <a href=""https://chatgpt.com/atlas/"">ChatGPT Atlas</a></figcaption></figure><p>Gulf of execution and gulf of evaluation are bridged across separate spaces. You execute through conversation in one space, but you evaluate by watching both the external workspace and reading feedback in the chat. This creates a supervisory relationship where the natural language interface is your control mechanism while work happens elsewhere. Users must monitor both spaces to fully understand what happened. Design principle from <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/ai-ux-design-for-intelligent-interfaces-bc966e96107d"">article written by Basu</a> emphasize how to provide clear indicators of what the agent is doing in the background, so users feel in control even when the system is proactive. Interpretation requires synthesizing information from the workspace (seeing what changed) and the chat (reading what the system did and why). The control panel enables iteration that you can refine, redirect, or build on previous turns while the agent continues working.</p><p>Agent Advancements like Anthropic’s <a href=""https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use"">Computer Use</a>, OpenAI’s <a href=""https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/"">Operator</a>, Google’s <a href=""https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-computer-use-model/"">Computer Space</a>, operates an entire computer or browser interface while you supervise from the chat panel. You provide high-level instructions (“book a restaurant reservation for Friday”), and the agent navigates websites, fills forms, and completes multi-step tasks. As these agents become more autonomous, the tension between letting them work and maintaining meaningful control becomes more acute, echoing the classic debate between direct manipulation and interface agents that <a href=""https://pienso.com/blog/direct-manipulation-vs-interface-agents-revisiting-the-classic-debate-decades-later"">Pienso</a> revisited in their 2024 analysis.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram comparing three natural language interface patterns. Pattern 1 shows a single full-screen conversation area. Pattern 2 displays a canvas with a contextual input field and separate workspace. Pattern 3 illustrates a split view with a chat panel on the right and workspace on the left"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5W0gVWTy1weWjKlAYZvXBg.png"" /></figure><p>Interaction loop can be summarized as follows:</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/dc5ca7d1bc382799e7d95e1b194822c9/href"">https://medium.com/media/dc5ca7d1bc382799e7d95e1b194822c9/href</a><p>While the three patterns above represent the primary ways natural language functions as an active interaction medium, two other common approaches exist but fall outside this framework. <em>Dedicated intent capture pages</em> like homepage or AI tool template galleries serve as short-lived entry points that help users articulate what they want before routing them to one of the three core patterns for actual work. <em>Promoted prompts as interface actions</em> like “Improve Writing” or “Summarize” buttons embed common natural language instructions into traditional UI elements, removing the need for users to type. These approaches differ fundamentally because they either don’t sustain the interaction (intent capture is just an entry point) or don’t require active natural language input (the instruction is predefined in the button).</p><h3>Reflections: How tools are built today and what’s ahead</h3><p>Looking at tools launched in 2024–2025, most follow a familiar structure: <a href=""https://www.thirteen23.com/updates/the-prompt-box-paradox"">start with an intent capture page</a> (templates, starter prompts), then route users to either Pattern 1 for conversational tasks or Pattern 3 for agent-driven work. Pattern 2 appears as embedded features within existing tools.</p><p>As tools mature, frequently-used prompts get “promoted” into buttons such as “Improve Writing,” “Summarize,” “Translate.” Natural language coexists with traditional UI, reducing friction for common tasks while preserving flexibility for open-ended prompting.</p><p>This structure isn’t entirely new, it mirrors how traditional software has been built for decades. Classic tools also started with an onboarding or template selection page, then moved users into the main workflow interface. The difference now is that within that workflow page, natural language acts as a new control layer, either as a control panel (Pattern 3) orchestrating work, or as an action bar (Pattern 2) augmenting existing canvas-based workflows.</p><h4>What patterns might emerge?</h4><p>As we move through 2026, one interesting question that strikes my mind is that, how will human intervention and interaction loop in these AI tools evolve?</p><figure><img alt=""Animated GIF showing a human finger and a robotic finger reaching toward each other against a cosmic sky background, symbolizing connection between humans and machines."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/0*in9E65KC0ifJVc5V.gif"" /></figure><p>Many tools have started addressing intervention, but few experiences have become overwhelming with multiple pause points, confirmation dialogs, and approval gates. The challenge is making intervention intuitive and natural, not just possible. Also, the users need to develop an strong mental model for when to step in versus when to trust the agent.</p><p>Also supervision isn’t enough. The real challenge is understanding <em>how and why the agent made changes</em>, a concern central to <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/guidelines-for-human-ai-interaction/"">Microsoft Research’s guidelines for human-AI interaction</a>.</p><blockquote>As agents become more capable, we risk creating dependency where users accomplish tasks but don’t understand the underlying work.</blockquote><p>This is critical for people learning new skills</p><p>When an agent generates code or modifies a design, users need to comprehend the reasoning: not just “lines 45–67 changed,” but “here’s why this approach, here’s the trade-off, here’s what else was considered.” Yet there’s a critical gap: agents can provide these explanations, but users still need foundational knowledge to fully grasp them. An explanation of why a particular code structure was chosen doesn’t help if you don’t understand fundamentals.</p><p>Without this understanding, users can’t effectively intervene, correct, or extend the work. They become dependent on the agent to modify its own output.Aubergine (2025) calls this the “<a href=""https://www.aubergine.co/insights/designing-for-ai-agents"">learning arc</a>” problem.</p><p>By designing systems that show learning progression, users experience agents as reliable collaborators that grow alongside them, not opaque black boxes.</p><p>The next generation of interaction model needs to balance efficiency with transparency. The design goal shifts from “make AI do the work” to “help users understand what’s being done and how they could do it themselves,” addressing what researchers at CHI 2020 identified as the <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376301"">unique difficulties in designing human-AI interaction</a>.</p><p>As product builders, our task is to observe how these interaction patterns perform, understand where they succeed and struggle, and continue pushing toward interfaces that make powerful tools that leverages accessibility, learnability and human control.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=8b39ed123c39"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/beyond-conversations-natural-language-as-interaction-influencer-8b39ed123c39"">Beyond conversations: natural language as interaction influencer</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",
