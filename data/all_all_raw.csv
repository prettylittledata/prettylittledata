At its heart lies a lush, intimate courtyard with a pool, visible from the home's primary living spaces and home gym, establishing the courtyard as both a literal and conceptual anchor. The architecture wraps gently around this core, with a series of soft curves that define the building's form and guide the spatial experience throughout.</p>",

It is an active participant of the space.&nbsp;</p>",

<p>Exploring navigation as something bigger than moving through physical and digital spaces — as a fundamental cognitive act</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*X6jNJk6M9uS348ftxZqXGQ.png"" /><figcaption>Shipping the package that’s yourself (Image generated using Procreate and Nanobanana)</figcaption></figure><p>A few weeks ago, I read an article — <a href=""https://www.doc.cc/articles/ai-navigation"">A new navigation paradigm</a> — that felt relatable, yet unsettling in a way I couldn’t fully articulate. I eventually stopped thinking about it, but the ideas lingered in the background. They then surfaced in the most mundane and seemingly unrelated places.</p><p>A few weeks later, as I struggled to submit a loan application online, I realized that my frustration stemmed from more than a technical problem. I had lost the ability to <em>navigate </em>the system.</p><p>Shortly after, while taking an Uber ride to a friend’s place, I caught myself in a moment of reflection. I was moving in the physical space with no attention to my surroundings, completely at the mercy of the driver, who was in turn following the instructions from his phone.</p><p>The kind of navigation I was doing in an Uber didn’t seem all that different from my attempts to navigate the banking system. Navigation suddenly felt bigger — like a fundamental cognitive act.</p><p>In this essay, I examine <strong>navigation in four different realms: institutional, physical, digital, and semantic</strong>. By exploring the commonalities, I hope to convey what’s at stake when we eliminate the <em>friction</em> of navigation, and how to deliberately regain some of it.</p><h3>Navigating the system</h3><p>I am currently attempting to fund a home loan through a major Indian bank that is committed to the idea of a “digital-first” India. As a sign of this commitment, they are now “digital-only” — they now process home loan applications online exclusively, or so I’m told. But the portal is a never-ending obstacle course, almost as if designed to test the user’s patience and persistence. It succeeds phenomenally.</p><p>I’m prompted for identification proofs as PDFs under 1MB or JPEGs under 5MB, but when I provide them, I get an error: <em>“Oops! Something went wrong.”</em> Of course, many things could go wrong. Underneath the digital interfaces is the cross-continent network that makes them all tick — the hundreds of hardware devices the data has to traverse, the tens of thousands of miles of wire crossing land and oceans. Distributed systems are built assuming ephemeral failures. But when they happen consistently, it signals something systemic.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*caGp-0y1osvEHv4av2lxqg.png"" /><figcaption>“Oops! Something went wrong.” Error while submitting documents on a banking portal</figcaption></figure><p>You know the problem is prevalent when it becomes material for comedy. Biswas Kalyan Rath, an Indian stand-up comedian, <a href=""https://youtu.be/PK_zuAuI9x0?si=szB908spPScog_k6&amp;t=64"">has a good bit about the state of “digital-first” marriage registration in India</a>.</p><blockquote>“Marriage, no problem. Very simple. Getting marriage registered.. Big problem. It was always a problem, now there is the illusion of Digital India. There is a website. You can go and register. No problem. Fill the entire form. The “Submit” button does not work.”</blockquote><p>I cracked up when I watched it. I’m not laughing now. I’m three weeks into the loan application, and I need it approved.</p><p>The deeper problem isn’t the bad website. It’s what it does to its users. I understand technology, but the bank’s application is a black box to me. The loan agent is an expert in the process but has proven useless. He’s as much a spectator in this as I am. I’m not merely dependent on the website; I’m trapped between technology that’s not done well and a human who doesn’t understand it well. We’ve both lost the ability to <em>navigate</em> the system.</p><h3>Navigating the physical world</h3><p>During my childhood, when I traveled by bus to my maternal hometown — Ichalkaranji, Maharashtra’s textile hub — we could tell we had arrived by the pungent smell and rhythmic din of the cotton mills. We could tell the time remaining by the landmarks we passed — the restaurants, the trees, the market, the temples, the stadium. Knowing a destination meant knowing its spatial signature. We had to read the surroundings to know when we had arrived. Navigation was an act of observation. Even the act of describing a destination meant being deeply aware of its characteristics. We saw a place as a point in space, situated relative to other places.</p><p>Then came paper maps, which provided a way to abstract the physical reality and capture its essence in symbols. It was a leap forward, but still required us to compare the map against the territory — active interpretation. The map acted as external memory. The processing still happened in your brain. In software terms, this was the separation of storage and compute. The maps only told you the layout. You had to orient yourself against it.</p><p>Then Google Maps outsourced “compute” too.</p><p>It wasn’t just paper maps on a screen. It offered a fundamentally different technology: <em>active navigation</em>. Active interpretation on the user’s part gave way to the step-by-step guidance from the software. It not only knew the landscape; it knew your place in it. You just had to trust it. Spatial navigation became a skill you no longer needed. When Google Maps tells me to “take the next exit and stay on the second to the right lane”, I mindlessly execute.</p><p>What navigation demands from me now is not intelligence but compliance.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2hg4yjIZHevidm3IrPtAhw.png"" /><figcaption>Navigating by compliance (Image generated using Procreate and Nanobanana)</figcaption></figure><p>I’m as much a victim as a culprit of this de-skilling that has happened at scale. Due to my overreliance on technology, I don’t remember the street names in my neighborhood anymore, despite having lived in the same place for over two years. It speaks to how little I pay attention to the world around me when the blue arrow and the friendly voice are leading the way.</p><p><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7156656/"">A 2020 longitudinal study</a> tracked regular drivers over three years and found that people with greater lifetime GPS experience demonstrated reduced spatial memory during self-guided navigation. It found not just correlation, but causality of GPS use leading to decline in spatial memory.</p><h3>Getting carried away</h3><p>Compare this to the Uber model.</p><p>You set the destination, a driver accepts, you accept, and off you go. One of the “benefits” of Uber is that it relieves you of the mundane act of driving. Your attentional resources, the logic goes, can be better spent on “more important” needs — like scrolling social media on your phone instead of greeting the human three feet away. Thanks to self-driving cars, we’ve even eliminated that guilt, if there ever was.</p><p>Somewhere in that scroll, you lose track of time, of the route, of your environment. You’re physically there, but mentally elsewhere. The only active role you’ve played is scheduling the pick-up and the drop-off. You’ve shipped the package that is yourself.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*k0y481sV4ABUh7-lWm-1RA.png"" /><figcaption>Uber pickup and drop-off</figcaption></figure><h3>Navigating the digital world</h3><p>Consider a typical day using digital interfaces. You log in to your computer or your phone, you find the application you need, navigate through its menus and screens, do what you want to do, close it, move on to the next app. It’s essentially an endless loop of navigation until you log off and go back to the real world.</p><p>This is akin to navigation in the pre-GPS world. There is a certain map of the world — the software’s user interface — and you have to learn it. You “onboard” yourself, and navigate it by paying attention. You are spatially aware of the world that the software has created for you. You know what capabilities it has, or where and how to find them.</p><p>We are increasingly moving towards an intent-based navigation system, or as I think of it, “Uber-ification” of the digital world. Intent-based software comes in two flavors: search-first, and AI-first.</p><p>In search-first applications, you search for keywords, say, “expense report” and it’ll show you potential actions like “View your expense reports” or “File a new expense report”. You select the one you want without knowing where it lives in the application. The geography doesn’t matter.</p><p>In AI-first applications, it’s even more extreme. You declare the intent — “File my expenses” — and the agent handles the rest. You’ve achieved your goal without ever knowing where the expense module is housed in the software, or even how to even file one yourself.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/727/1*Z3AwXnIZWn1Ceh_Qq9795Q.png"" /><figcaption>Intent-driven: Search-first</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/743/1*0Z9bFsL-7NjcpvzCWKIg1Q.png"" /><figcaption>Intent-driven: AI-first</figcaption></figure><p>There’s a plethora of intent-based software now, with AI embedded in them, eager to translate your intent into outcomes.

The agent navigates for you.</p><h3>Beyond movement: Navigation as a metacognitive skill</h3><p>Consider what happens when you navigate without GPS in an unfamiliar city. You <strong>assess</strong> your current location, <strong>identify</strong> your destination, <strong>survey</strong> available information — landmarks, street signs, smell, sounds, <strong>hypothesize</strong> about which direction to go, <strong>make decisions</strong> with incomplete information, <strong>monitor</strong> feedback as you move, <strong>adjust</strong>, when you encounter obstacles, wrong turns, or dead ends, and <strong>learn</strong> from the experience, building a richer understanding of the territory.</p><p>Now consider what you do when you’re trying to understand a topic, say, climate change. You <strong>assess</strong> what you currently know or understand, <strong>identify</strong> what you need to know, <strong>survey</strong> available information — documentation, courses, articles, real world case-studies, papers, mental models, <strong>hypothesize</strong> about how it might work, <strong>make decisions</strong> about which path to explore first with incomplete information, <strong>monitor</strong> feedback as you learn, <strong>adjust</strong> your mental model when you hit obstacles, and <strong>learn</strong>, building a richer, more accurate understanding of the system.</p><p>Problem-solving is navigation. Learning is navigation. Decision-making is navigation. You’re moving through space — either real or conceptual — through uncertainty, towards clarity, understanding, destination, or outcomes.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*d711JP8zbOaFo9j4j8lQUQ.png"" /><figcaption>Navigating to clarity (Image generated using Procreate and Nanobanana)</figcaption></figure><p>This isn’t a metaphor. <a href=""https://iiif.library.cmu.edu/file/Simon_box00065_fld05031_bdl0001_doc0001/Simon_box00065_fld05031_bdl0001_doc0001.pdf"">Herbert Simon’s work</a> describes problem-solving as “search through a problem-space.” <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5248972/"">Neuroscience has also shown that the same neural systems(the hippocampus, place, and grid cells)</a> support both physical and conceptual navigation. What makes something navigation isn’t whether it moves through a physical space, but rather that it requires relational mapping, position assessment, route planning, and dynamic reorganization.</p><p>So we are navigating pretty much all the time. And it’s becoming easier with technology. So what?</p><p>Just as GPS use causes a measurable decline in our spatial memory, AI tools that navigate conceptual spaces for us pose the same risk in a different, arguably more critical, domain.</p><h3>The Pharmakon and the problem with frictionless</h3><p>Looking at technological innovations through the lens of <a href=""https://aeon.co/essays/bernard-stieglers-philosophy-on-how-technology-shapes-our-world""><em>pharmakon</em></a> — both remedy and poison — remedies are clearly visible: speed, efficiency, productivity, convenience. Even when they’re not, organizations are happy to sell us on them.</p><p>The poisons are more subtle: dependency, agency, losing the cognitive friction that maintains our capacity to navigate. The agent absorbs the cost of navigation, but it also becomes the locus of agency.</p><p>Two risks that stand out, and are worth thinking about:</p><p><strong>The transfer of agency</strong>: By shifting the agency of navigation to the software, you end up being at the mercy of the navigator. <a href=""https://outofdesk.blog/performance-reviews-llms"">If the AI routes you, you stop thinking about alternatives.</a> The convenience is paid for with a little bit of your money and a lot more of your agency. With the erasure of navigation, Information Architecture gives way to Choice Architecture.</p><p>This might be fine for filing tax returns. Humanity would benefit from spending less time doing that. But what happens when the same happens with critical thinking? Comprehension? Reflection? Decision-making?</p><p><strong>The vacuum of attention</strong>: With the time and attention you’ve regained from not navigating, you need something meaningful to do. Few people know what to do with that kind of freedom. They look to technology to fill the void. But the incentives of technology companies, more often than not, don’t align with the well-being of the user, especially when the way to make money and user interests are at odds.</p><p>When you’re not navigating and also not driving, there’s the promise of reflecting, reading, thinking, writing, or building. But first, why not catch up on what your friends are doing? Or the Kardashians? Or millions of strangers?</p><p>It presents a dark irony: We save time by delegating things to technology, only to pour that time back into it, mindlessly scrolling.</p><h3>Solutions: For victims and culprits</h3><p>I want to think about solutions to this problem, both as a victim — a consumer and a <em>navigator</em> — and a culprit — someone who builds technology products, and <em>designs </em>navigation.</p><p>I say culprits not because they have bad intentions, but likely because they either lack any or they are acting on misaligned incentives.</p><h3>Micro-frictions as the antidote for the victim</h3><p>I’m learning to be more intentional about what friction I want to eliminate and what I want to preserve. About what navigation I want to do myself versus delegate.</p><p>I use AI every day. It has largely empowered me. But I’m deliberate in its use.</p><p>I resist the temptation to start with AI-generated drafts because the value of writing lies in the struggle to articulate the original thought. It’s that struggle that clarifies what you want to say, what you want to achieve. Only then do I use AI. My process isn’t simply sequential, so the handoff isn’t a clear line. It’s a feedback loop. But the bulk of my effort goes into the pre-AI phase, ensuring that I build a vision for the artifact that I want to produce — whether it’s an essay or software. I can then direct it rather than being led by it.</p><p>For places I visit regularly, I’ve stopped using maps. I’m rebuilding the habit of paying attention to my surroundings.</p><p>I keep my phone away when I’m with my kids, both to be present with them and implicitly teach them the value of paying attention. I find pockets of time severed from technology — sipping coffee, going on walks — which builds the habit of being comfortable alone with my thoughts.</p><p>How is this all related to navigation, you say? Intentionality brings clarity, which in turn helps you navigate effectively.</p><p>If you want to read more about this idea of introducing friction, this article from The Cut captures it well: <a href=""https://www.thecut.com/article/brooding-friction-maxxing-new-years-2026-resolution.html""><em>In 2026, We Are Friction-Maxxing</em></a>.</p><h3>Design principles for technologists as culprits</h3><p>This might sound obvious, but when designing technology products, it helps to keep users’ needs <em>and well-being</em> in mind.</p><p><strong>Build robust fallback mechanisms:</strong> In the banking portal, when the “digital-only” system failed, neither the customer nor the employee could navigate an alternative path. The system had eliminated all other routes.</p><p>Before implementing AI assistance or intent-based shortcuts, think about whether the user can complete the task if the feature breaks or is unavailable. Build fallback mechanisms that allow manual navigation when automated paths fail, surface error states that help users understand what went wrong, provide enough context for users to troubleshoot independently, and maintain alternative paths to the same destination.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tGOrUoGbx8Q4_Dqgx6_wrw.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/9356221-deploy-fin-ai-agent-over-email"">Fin agent fallback</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Distinguish between transactional and developmental tasks:</strong> When developing automations, distinguish between <strong>transactional tasks</strong> (filing taxes, scheduling meetings, data entry) and <strong>developmental tasks</strong> (writing, learning, problem-solving, decision-making). This is similar to the idea of distinguishing between <a href=""https://outofdesk.blog/thinking-outside-the-doc"">competitive artifacts and complementary artifacts</a>.</p><p>Transactional tasks should be frictionless. These are tasks where efficiency is the primary goal, and there’s little value in the process itself. But developmental tasks benefit from <a href=""https://every.to/thesis/in-the-ai-age-making-things-difficult-is-deliberate"">good friction</a>. The process of navigating uncertainty is often where the real value lies.</p><p><a href=""https://danielmiessler.com/blog/keep-the-robots-out-of-the-gym"">“Gym skills”</a> is a good metaphor. For developmental tasks, consider AI as a collaborator that augments rather than replaces the user’s cognitive work. <a href=""https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/blog/the-importance-of-friction-in-ai-systems/"">Speculative and Critical Design (SCD)</a> framework lays out one of the most articulate ways to think about this.</p><p><strong>Adjust assistance based on expertise:</strong> Design systems that adjust assistance levels based on user expertise, because effective delegation requires good judgment on the user’s part.</p><p>Beginners benefit from more guidance, explanations, and visible structure to help them build mental models of the system. Intermediate users can make effective use of shortcuts and intent-based features, but in a way that traditional navigation is visible and accessible. Expert users demand customizability, creating their own navigation paths, or even disabling assistance they don’t need.</p><p>The problem with many AI-first products is that they apply the same level of automation to everyone, preventing users from ever developing expertise. A newly minted manager using AI to completely delegate the work of crafting performance reviews for the team, for example, isn’t going to build the muscle of reflecting on the relationships with people, paying attention to their motivations, strengths, and weaknesses.</p><p><strong>Preserve visible structure:</strong> Even with search-first or AI-first interfaces, users benefit from understanding the underlying structure. Consider <strong>visual sitemaps or navigation breadcrumbs</strong> that show users where they are in the system, <strong>contextual hints</strong> about where information lives, even when delivering it through search, and <strong>progressive disclosure</strong> that reveals structure as users engage more deeply with the product.</p><p><a href=""https://www.aiuxdesign.guide/"">aiuxdesign.guide</a> has a comprehensive set of design patterns that mention some of these and more, with real-world examples.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>There are a few pockets of life that haven’t been taken over by assistive and active technology. Building the muscle to tolerate (and design) good friction and (help) reclaiming the ownership of your attention are good starts to prepare for what’s ahead. There’s little I can do to navigate the banking system. But there are other areas I can exercise control, both as a creator and a consumer.</p><p><em>Find me on </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ggauravr/""><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em>, </em><a href=""https://x.com/outofdesk""><em>X</em></a><em>, or check out my </em><a href=""https://outofdesk.blog/""><em>blog here</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3>Inspirations and references</h3><ul><li><a href=""https://www.doc.cc/articles/ai-navigation"">DOC • A new navigation paradigm</a></li><li><a href=""https://signalpath.substack.com/p/do-ai-products-even-need-navigation"">Do AI Products Even Need Navigation? — by Andrew Sims</a></li><li><a href=""https://aeon.co/essays/bernard-stieglers-philosophy-on-how-technology-shapes-our-world"">Bernard Stiegler’s philosophy on how technology shapes our world | Aeon Essays</a></li><li><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7156656/"">Habitual use of GPS negatively impacts spatial memory during self-guided navigation — PMC</a></li><li><a href=""https://youtu.be/PK_zuAuI9x0?si=szB908spPScog_k6&amp;t=64"">Biswa Kalyan Rath | Birth Proof | Stand Up Comedy</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.thecut.com/article/brooding-friction-maxxing-new-years-2026-resolution.html"">In 2026, We Are Friction-Maxxing</a></li><li><a href=""https://iiif.library.cmu.edu/file/Simon_box00065_fld05031_bdl0001_doc0001/Simon_box00065_fld05031_bdl0001_doc0001.pdf"">THE THEORY OF PROBLEM SOLVING</a></li><li><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5248972/"">Organizing Conceptual Knowledge in Humans with a Grid-like Code — PMC</a></li><li><a href=""https://asana.com/ai-principles"">Asana — Our principles for helping humanity thrive with AI</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.psychoftech.org/blog/2020/3/10/cognitive-artifacts"">Cognitive Artifacts — Psychology of Technology Institute</a></li><li><a href=""https://every.to/thesis/in-the-ai-age-making-things-difficult-is-deliberate"">In the AI Age, Making Things Difficult Is Deliberate | Every</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.notion.com/blog/the-design-thinking-behind-notion-ai"">The Thinking Behind Notion AI</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/blog/the-importance-of-friction-in-ai-systems/"">The Importance of Fricton in AI Systems | Mozilla Foundation</a></li><li><a href=""https://hbr.org/2022/06/why-ai-customer-journeys-need-more-friction"">Why AI Customer Journeys Need More Friction | HBR</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.aiuxdesign.guide/"">AI UX Design Patterns</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=f6c63585f7af"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/getting-carried-away-when-intelligence-is-replaced-by-compliance-f6c63585f7af"">Getting carried away: When intelligence is replaced by compliance</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4><em>How product teams should evaluate AI-generated UI</em></h4><p>AI app-building tools have made it inconsequential and mundane to turn an idea into a working prototype. You only need a couple prompts, a design file, or even a sketch to quickly generate something that looks (even behaves) like a real product. For product teams, this speed has changed expectations in the design and development process.</p><p>Prototypes are no longer as special as they once were. They’re now the bare minimum.</p><p>But this speed comes with limitations. Many AI-generated prototypes are never meant to survive past the moment they’re validated. They do their job in a meeting or a user test, but then they’re rebuilt by engineering or even trashed. But the prototypes didn’t “fail,” they were just created with a different intention and outcome.</p><p>The hidden cost of AI prototypes is that they can’t move forward. And when the underlying output is treated as “disposable” automatically, product teams pay for it later in the product lifecycle through translation work, rewrites, and reduced speed.</p><figure><img alt=""Creating AI-prototypes in Anima and Replit tools"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tQwxealvhwQ05oy5oeR0CQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>AI tools have changed the design-dev workflow; can prototypes thrive through product stages?</em></figcaption></figure><p>It’s no question that AI has become part of everyday product development. But it’s no longer just how fast we can generate UI, it’s more about what kind of output we are creating. We need to think past prototypes that can be used for a 30 minute stakeholder review, such as thinking about what happens after the ideation stage ends.</p><p>Some tools are optimized for ideation and to quickly answer questions. But others are beginning to treat AI output as the first draft of real product work. Let’s get into understanding how AI prototypes can survive the product lifecycle, tools that are better for different prototype use cases, and criteria to help product teams choose the right prototype for their needs.</p><h3>What it means for an AI prototype to “survive”</h3><p>Most product teams don’t struggle to generate UI anymore. But they do have a challenge in deciding whether what they’ve generated is something they can both keep and use.</p><h4>It’s more than visual polish</h4><p>AI-generated prototypes can look visually polished and even behave as intended, but it still may not survive past the ideation phase. We need to think about what the prototype allows a product team to do after ideation.</p><p>Some questions to ask when deciding if your prototype will survive past ideation:</p><ul><li>Can the prototype be extended without starting over?</li><li>Can it be handed off without being reinterpreted?</li><li>Can it live outside the AI tool that created it?</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Design visuals and code output produced by Framer, but is limited to the tool itself"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oZwkGkR7NdhBq_lFLRSHnw.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.framer.com/""><em>Framer</em></a><em> automatically produces code for the visuals generated, but can it live outside Framer?</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you begin to think about the extensibility of your prototype too late (like after it’s been validated), you might quickly reach a dead end. Though the UI looks high-quality and finished, it deceives what’s lying under the hood in the actual output.</p><p>Not only that, many AI-generated prototypes are abstract. They render well in the tool that created them, but the underlying structure is hazy or even constricted to the AI tool. These prototypes do help answer early questions, like “Does this flow make sense?,” but they’re difficult to carry forward without translation or rework.</p><h4>Proper structure outlasts visuals</h4><p>Durable prototypes are built from real frontend formatting, like structured markup, predictable layout, and clear component usage. This structure makes the prototype legible to engineers, collaborators, and the AI tools themselves.</p><p>When the prototype’s output is inspectable and portable to other tools, it can be understood and evolved.</p><figure><img alt=""Code output from Anima App that prioritizes production-readiness and portability"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wt9uB0MxkXLJ4PUX2_f0_w.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://dev.animaapp.com/""><em>Anima App</em></a><em> generates designs and code intended to be used outside the tool</em></figcaption></figure><p>AI tools can only amplify the inputs and outputs you continue to build from. Abstract AI output compounds into rework with teams regenerating or rebuilding what already exists. But clean, structured output encourages faster iteration and usable output because each change builds on the last.</p><p>An AI prototype’s “lifespan” reflects what the tool was optimized to create. Understanding the distinction between a disposable or durable helps teams choose tools that match what they intend to build.</p><h3>How AI app-building tools optimize for different lifespans</h3><p>Once you start looking at AI-generated prototypes in terms of their lifespan, you’ll notice patterns across popular AI tools available to product teams. You’re probably assuming that AI app-building tools are all trying to do the same thing, like producing high-quality designs and code.</p><p>But these AI tools are actually optimized for different stages in the product lifecycle. Most fall under three main buckets: full-stack generators, visual builders, or design-native generators. Let’s look at familiar tools found in each bucket.</p><h4>Full-stack AI generators</h4><p>Full-stack generators like Bolt, Lovable, and Replit are designed to produce end-to-end applications quickly. They can handle the generated app’s infrastructure, hosting, and behavior for multiple user flows. These tools are powerful when experimenting or needing quick product deployments.</p><figure><img alt=""Full-stack AI tools like Replit create rapid prototypes for desktop and mobile"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RBqDSAceLsOOOPUDy3qTqg.png"" /><figcaption><em>AI tools like </em><a href=""https://replit.com/products/design""><em>Replit</em></a><em> are ideal for small product teams with rapid timelines</em></figcaption></figure><p>Benefits:</p><ul><li>Extremely fast method to go from idea to working application</li><li>Low setup needed for end-to-end generation</li><li>Allows quick validation for solo or small teams</li></ul><p>Limitations:</p><ul><li>Code output is typically bound to the tool that generated it</li><li>Code structure prioritizes quick execution over long-term durability</li><li>Harder integrate the frontend work into existing codebases</li><li>Less flexibility when engineers need more control</li></ul><h4>Visual building tools</h4><p>Visual builders such as Webflow and Framer are ideal for creating polished experiences that live within the platform itself. They’re well-suited for marketing sites or even personal websites where the tool itself is part of the delivery method. Since the AI tool is also the production environment, handoff of frontend code to engineering is secondary or unnecessary.</p><figure><img alt=""Visual builders like Framer produce responsive and visual UI, but are constrained to the tool itself"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3ckByB8Nntl2Mvs1kD7TMw.png"" /><figcaption><em>Visual builders like </em><a href=""https://www.framer.com/""><em>Framer</em></a><em> produce responsive and visual UI, but are constrained to the tool</em></figcaption></figure><p>Benefits:</p><ul><li>High-fidelity, production-quality visual output</li><li>Supports publishing, hosting, and content management workflows</li><li>Designers can own and ship real experiences</li><li>Reliable for marketing and personal websites</li></ul><p>Limitations:</p><ul><li>Exported code is not intended for strategic evolution</li><li>Included logic in the frontend is dependent on the platform</li><li>Restricts deep engineering customization and may need rework</li></ul><h4>Design-native generators</h4><p>Design-native generation tools, like Figma Make, are ideal for high-speed exploration. They help teams iterate on structure, layout, and user flow directly inside the design tool. The output is effective as a reference when reviewing and testing, but it’s not intended to be integrated in a production codebase.</p><figure><img alt=""Figma Make is integrated within the design tool, but it’s focused more on visual output versus code"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Igk5W5dDfw6FN99LpI2JSQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1IssNgKM28""><em>Figma Make</em></a><em> is integrated within the design tool, but the output focuses on visual vs. code output</em></figcaption></figure><p>Benefits:</p><ul><li>Fast iteration inside existing design-product workflows</li><li>Smooth exploration for UI layouts and user flows</li><li>Effective for early validation and team collaboration</li></ul><p>Limitations:</p><ul><li>Output is a reference versus a code foundation</li><li>Engineers may need to rebuild rather than extend the frontend code</li><li>Optimized for exploration, but not product maturation</li></ul><p>None of these tool approaches are inherently better or worse, but teams need to understand what each tool is optimized to do. Whether it be to answer questions early in the ideation phase or to publish product experience. They just reflect different assumptions about what happens after a prototype proves its point.</p><h3>Designing AI-generated prototypes to continue past ideation</h3><p>Most AI-generated prototypes were created to answer questions or validate a direction while in the ideation phase. They weren’t produced to become part of the actual product.</p><p>But instead of asking, “How fast can we generate this?,” teams need to start asking, “What happens if this works?” That shift changes what kind of output matters and the right tool to use.</p><p>To help with this shift, teams need to generate prototypes that are made from the same fundamentals as production. This includes real HTML elements, predictable layout, and clear UI components to make the output understandable to engineers and other tools.</p><h4>AI accelerates continuity or disposability</h4><p>This is where the output’s effects on AI are unavoidable. Because each AI-generation builds on what already exists, unstructured output compounds issues–causing regenerating or rebuilding the same ideas again and again.</p><p>So prototypes designed to continue get better as the AI-generations evolve, while prototypes designed to be temporary get replaced.</p><figure><img alt=""Anima generates prototypes starting from Figma designs, live websites, or brand inspiration"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Tl2SNCCCw0yqtdTvE_npRw.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://dev.animaapp.com/""><em>Anima</em></a><em> can generate prototypes starting from Figma designs or live websites</em></figcaption></figure><h4>Tools that create durable AI prototypes</h4><p>Real products progress from existing interfaces/ patterns or partial designs; not from blank prompts.

The tool focuses on creating structured, real frontend code that can be handed off to development versus showing a high-quality render of UI designs.</p><figure><img alt=""Anima creates both high-fidelity visuals and code ready to be exported outside the tool"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uDzBp4JfFjnUDNhD-uiUkg.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://dev.animaapp.com/""><em>Anima</em></a><em> creates both high-fidelity visuals and code ready to be exported outside the tool</em></figcaption></figure><p>Anima’s prototypes include added value not only from their usability from the get-go, but by reducing translation work once engineers begin to review the code output.</p><p>Designing AI prototypes doesn’t mean every prototype has to be production-ready. It just means product teams can choose whether the work they’re creating is meant to be disposable or durable.</p><h3>How teams should decide what kind of prototype they’re building</h3><p>Before evaluating any AI app-building tool, product teams need to clarify a few questions to select relevant criteria to rate each tool against. This will allow teams to use tools more intentionally and avoid the disposal of work later in the design lifecycle.</p><p>Questions teams should ask themselves:</p><ul><li>What is this prototype meant to do? (i.e., validate an idea vs. create production work)</li><li>What happens after idea validation? (i.e., restart/ re-build vs. handoff to engineers)</li><li>Should code output be modified outside the AI tool? (or is it okay for output to be bound to the tool?)</li><li>Should the code and AI tool support long-term iteration? (or is the output only for one-off ideas?)</li></ul><p>If your team’s goals are to validate ideas quickly, disposable prototypes are a wanted tool outcome versus a flaw. But if the goal is to create prototypes that will evolve into production, you’ll need AI tools that support that.</p><figure><img alt=""The AI tool for your team depends on your workflow and the intended deliverables, like useful visuals or useful code"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UMQymkGoKbUlTF5NWrje0g.png"" /><figcaption><em>Selecting an AI tool for your team depends on your workflow and the intended deliverables</em></figcaption></figure><h4>Optimize for the prototype lifespan you need</h4><p>Different tools optimize for different lifespans; here is a key to help make quick decisions:</p><ul><li>Short-lived artifacts that answer questions quickly → Design-native generators</li><li>Platform-contained experiences that publish efficiently → Visual building tools</li><li>Structured outputs that can serve as production foundations → Full-stack AI generators</li></ul><p>Again, none of these tools are superior. The right choice just depends on how long the work is expected to “live” and who will own it from iteration to iteration.</p><p>When teams evaluate tools based on intention, like what they’ll be able to keep or build on, they shift their mindset from only speed alone to idea continuity.</p><p>AI has dramatically lowered the cost of starting in such a short time-span. Quickly generating interfaces, user flows, and functional apps is no longer the hard part. But now, it isn’t how quickly product teams can produce prototypes, it’s how much of that work they can carry forward.</p><p>The hidden cost of AI prototypes isn’t that they fail to deliver. It’s that many were never designed to. Product teams need to evaluate tools based on what they generate as well as what they help advance to move away from disposable prototypes to evolving beginnings.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=00cc4d491dec"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-hidden-cost-of-ai-prototypes-that-are-made-to-die-00cc4d491dec"">The hidden cost of AI prototypes that are made to die</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Tools like Maze, Dovetail, Outset AI, and Listen Labs have compressed what used to take six to eight weeks into hours.</p><p>The global AI-based research services market is projected to grow from roughly $8 billion in 2025 to over $35 billion by 2035, according to <a href=""https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/ai-based-research-services-market"">Future Market Insights</a>:</p><blockquote>“During the first five-year period from 2025 to 2030, the market increases from USD 7,972.1 million to USD 16,804.0 million… AI-accelerated survey analytics dominates this period with 38.3% share, as enterprises increasingly automate survey feedback and real-time opinion tracking.”</blockquote><p>The commodity layer of research is being automated, and it is happening fast.</p><p>This is good, and it's terrifying.</p><p>Good, because the structured, repeatable parts of research have been heading toward automation for a while. I was using UserTesting.com over high-volume concept testing, quick-turn usability studies, and pattern recognition across large datasets. Machines are better at speed and scale. A <a href=""https://www.displayr.com/ai-in-market-research-today-trends-tools-and-whats-next/"">Displayr study</a> found that 85% of researchers said automated tools have already improved their workflow:</p><blockquote>“What once took weeks of manual labor can now be achieved in days — or even hours — freeing researchers to focus on the strategic questions that really matter.”</blockquote><p>Terrifying, because the industry is confusing data collection with understanding… two fundamentally different things. And if you have built your career on the gathering side of that equation, you are now competing with software that works faster, cheaper, and around the clock.</p><h3>The gathering is not the knowing: Where AI tools fall short</h3><p>Hot take: the hardest part of research was never gathering the data.</p><p>The hard part is <em>making sense</em> of what you find in the context of a business that has politics, constraints, competing priorities, and customers who say one thing and do another.</p><p>AI platforms work from their own interview data. They can surface the top themes from 50 conversations and present them in a tidy dashboard… Great!</p><p>What they cannot do is synthesize those themes against your:</p><ul><li>Analytics</li><li>Competitive landscape</li><li>Organizational dynamics</li><li>And the thing your VP said in a hallway conversation last Tuesday that reframed the entire strategic direction (Yes, this happens all the time)</li></ul><p>That synthesis layer requires <strong>judgment</strong>. It requires presence. It requires years of accumulated pattern recognition that no language model can replicate, because it depends on <strong>understanding your organization</strong>, not just your users.</p><p>Svend Brinkmann warned about the <a href=""https://tidsskrift.dk/qual/article/view/6273"">“McDonaldization” of qualitative research</a> over a decade ago: the reduction of a craft-based discipline into standardized, repeatable processes optimized for efficiency.</p><p>AI has accelerated that trajectory. A <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/research-metrics-and-analytics/articles/10.3389/frma.2024.1331589/full"">2025 study in Frontiers in Research Metrics and Analytics</a> found that AI’s emphasis on structured, data-driven processes risks reinforcing positivist assumptions in qualitative work, losing the relational, situated, and cultural richness that makes qualitative research worth doing in the first place:</p><blockquote>“Automated programmes with clear rules and formulae consistently followed each time do not work well under interpretivism’s assumptions. Researchers who use a general artificial intelligence agent only cover the rules-based epistemological spectrum of positivism.”</blockquote><p>Lincoln and Guba said it best in 1985: The instrument of choice in qualitative research is the human. Humans are responsive to environmental cues, able to collect information at multiple levels simultaneously, and capable of exploring the unexpected. A machine can present raw material and initial patterns.</p><p>The act of meaning-making remains a <em>uniquely</em> human endeavor.</p><h3>Where humans must excel</h3><p>If the data collection layer is being commoditized, the question for every researcher becomes: what is left? The answer is everything that matters. But “everything that matters” demands specificity. Here are the five domains where human researchers are irreplaceable, and where the best practitioners are already doubling down.</p><h4><strong>1. Strategic synthesis across multiple inputs</strong></h4><p>AI gives you themes. A skilled researcher gives you a decision. The real value of research has always been the “so what should we actually do?” layer: integrating user data with business context, market dynamics, and organizational realities to produce recommendations that drive action.</p><p>This means your research readout cannot end with “here is what users said.” It must end with “here is what we should build, stop building, or invest in next, and here is why.”</p><p>If your deliverables do not connect to revenue, retention, or competitive positioning, you are delivering a report. The AI can do that now.</p><h4><strong>2. The relationship and trust layer</strong></h4><p>When organizations invest in research, they are buying judgment. They need someone who can push back on stakeholder assumptions, read a room, change a presentation on the fly, and tell a leadership team something they do not want to hear in a way they can actually hear it. This skill compounds over time. The researcher who understands a client’s organizational politics, who has built credibility with a skeptical CPO, who knows which battles to pick and which to table for next quarter, that person is not a vendor. They are a strategic partner. No platform replicates that.</p><h4><strong>3. Cross-cultural and international depth</strong></h4><p>AI interviews work well in English and a handful of other languages. The nuance of cross-cultural research, including regulatory differences, market-by-market strategy, and the things people mean but do not say, requires researchers who have spent years embedded in those markets.</p><p>No language model has lived in São Paulo, navigated regulatory frameworks in Mumbai, or understood why a French consumer’s “<em>No</em>” means something different than an American’s. As companies expand globally, this skill becomes a multiplier, not a nice-to-have.</p><h4><strong>4. Complex qualitative methods</strong></h4><p>Diary studies. Ethnography. Longitudinal research. Contextual inquiry in physical environments. These are immersive methods that require presence, adaptation, and the kind of rapport that only happens between people. They cannot be compressed into a chatbot interface.</p><p>And they produce the kind of deep, contextual insight that drives transformative product decisions, the kind of insight that a theme cluster in a dashboard will never surface. Even the AI knows this. When <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11103925/"">Hitch et al.</a> asked ChatGPT to perform qualitative analysis, the model responded:</p><blockquote>“As an AI language model, I cannot perform qualitative analysis on the data above as it requires a more nuanced understanding of context, and the ability to interpret and analyze human language in context.”</blockquote><p>When the tool itself tells you it cannot do the work, that is worth paying attention to.</p><h4><strong>5. AI decision advisory</strong></h4><p>This is the frontier most researchers are ignoring entirely, and the one with the most upside.</p><p>As organizations deploy AI agents, copilots, and automated workflows, someone needs to figure out where those systems should and should not operate.</p><blockquote>How do you design human-AI workflows? Where does automation create value, and where does it destroy trust? What gets delegated to an agent, and what requires a human in the loop?</blockquote><p>These are research questions. They require researchers who understand both the technology and the humans it serves. The companies making the best AI decisions right now are not the ones with the best models. They are the ones with the best judgment about where to apply them. If you are not building fluency here, you are leaving the most strategic seat at the table empty.</p><h3>The researcher’s new job description</h3><p>The researchers who thrive in this landscape will be the ones who make the best decisions from data that is already abundant. This requires a shift in how you think about your role. Here is a framework for evaluating where you stand and what to do about it.</p><h4><strong>Three questions to ask yourself:</strong></h4><ol><li>Does my contribution on this project require judgment that depends on context a machine does not have? If yes, you are in the strategic layer. If no, you are doing work that will be automated within 18 months.</li><li>Does my deliverable connect research findings to a business decision? If your output is a report that summarizes what users said, that is commodity work. If your output is a recommendation backed by synthesis across multiple data sources, that is strategy.</li><li>Am I building relationships that make my judgment more valuable over time? Institutional knowledge, stakeholder trust, and cross-functional credibility are compounding assets. They are the moat.</li></ol><h4><strong>Build the skills that sit on top of the data</strong></h4><p>Learn to read a P&amp;L statement. Understand how your company makes pricing decisions. Shadow a sales call. Sit in on a board prep meeting. The researchers who will lead this industry are the ones who can walk into a room of executives and connect a research finding to a revenue outcome in language the CFO understands.</p><p>That is not a natural extension of most research training programs. It is the gap you need to close, and closing it is entirely within your control.</p><h4><strong>Use AI tools aggressively for the commodity layer</strong></h4><p>Do not resist the tools. Use them. Automate your transcription, your initial coding, your pattern recognition across large datasets. Let the machine handle what it handles well so you can spend more time on synthesis, strategy, and the client conversations that actually move the needle.</p><p>A <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11103925/"">2024 study published in PMC</a> put it plainly: AI can augment, but not replace, the work of human researchers in producing rigorous analysis, so long as it is applied in a mindful and ethical manner.</p><p>Treat AI tools the way a skilled carpenter treats a power tool: useful for speed, dangerous if you let it do your thinking.</p><h4><strong>Start advising on AI decisions, not just user decisions</strong></h4><p>Every organization is asking some version of the same question right now: Where should we use AI, and where should we not? Researchers are uniquely positioned to answer this because the question is fundamentally about human behavior, trust, and context.</p><p>Start volunteering for AI strategy conversations. Offer to run evaluations of AI-powered workflows. Frame your expertise around the question that every executive is losing sleep over: How do we deploy this technology without alienating the people it is supposed to serve?</p><h4><strong>Position yourself as the person who turns signal into decisions</strong></h4><p>This is the through-line. Every skill on this list, every shift in how you approach your work, comes back to one distinction: Are you gathering signal, or are you turning signal into decisions? The first is being commoditized. The second is becoming more valuable every day.</p><p>If your work ends with a research readout, you are on the wrong side of that line. If your work ends with a decision that moves the business, i.e. your make the business money, you are <em>exactly</em> where you need to be.</p><h3>The Opportunity</h3><p>The research industry is being reorganized, but this is just a correction. For years, the value of research was bottlenecked by the logistics of data collection. It took weeks to recruit, schedule, conduct, transcribe, and analyze.</p><p>The practitioners who could manage that pipeline were valuable because the pipeline was hard. Now the pipeline is easy. And the people who always knew that the pipeline was not the point, that the real work starts after the data is collected, those people are about to have their moment.</p><p>The strategic layer of research is becoming <em>more</em> valuable, not less. Those of us who have spent years building judgment, who can synthesize across messy inputs, who can advise on the hardest questions organizations face about AI, growth, and customer strategy… we are holding the one asset that cannot be automated. And for the first time, the logistics of data collection are no longer standing between us and the work that actually matters.</p><p>This is the best time in a generation to be a researcher who thinks strategically. The noise is being filtered by machines. The signal is waiting for someone with the judgment to act on it.</p><p>The tools got smarter… the question is whether you did too.</p><p><a href=""https://www.joshlamar.com/""><em>Josh LaMar</em></a><em> is a product growth strategy and AI decision advisor with over 20 years in product, technology, and customer strategy.

While I thought I was getting fired or about to get started on an urgent design ask, he just wanted to talk about philosophy &amp; K-Pop. As jarring as that was, I found it hilarious. During one of those calls, he shared an anecdote about how he helped his daughter with a college essay using ChatGPT. I used to work as a writing tutor, so any use of ChatGPT in the writing process struck me as suspicious. But, what they did with AI for her essay was actually brilliant.</p><p>He suggested that she write out the full essay with reckless abandon for citing sources: no reference formatting, no concern for straw-manned arguments, accurate quotes, or making sure paraphrases are in her own words. Rather, just write all the ideas down first. Then, upload the essay to ChatGPT and have it run a plagiarism check, finding the sources the draft is referencing. From there, they would review the ‘plagiarized’ sources, cite &amp; quote them properly, or remove the content from the essay, and weave it into her original work.</p><p>While, at first glance, I had my reservations, I realized this approach didn’t replace her voice or her original work; it reduced friction in her writing process. Here’s why: She first began writing everything on her own &amp; without AI, so the tone, style, and phrasing were hers alone. Second, while she might be inaccurate or wrong about how she alluded to or referenced sources, all that can be corrected later. Lastly, she had ChatGPT handle the critical &amp; clerical work: suggesting revisions, searching for relevant sources, and helping her integrate them properly into whatever citation style her class required. AI wasn’t writing the essay for her, she was using AI effectively by keeping her “authentic voice… to <em>enhance</em> expression, not to replace original thought,” as the <em>Enago Academy</em> would couch it.¹ Her voice came first, ChatGPT came second.</p><p>At the writing center I worked for, students could ask for help with anything from brainstorming paper topics to final edits. Our job was to guide students by keeping them on topic, catching blindspots, grammatical mistakes, and shaping the general structure. We gave them the feedback, but the students still had to apply it. The same is true for setting up AI as a writing tutor. I’ll argue that AI platforms setup with a tutoring persona can preserve a writer’s creative integrity and remove friction for research &amp; citing sources. I’ll demonstrate this through a reverse-engineering drafting (or reDraft) process for writing.</p><p>Before laying the process out, I’ll explain why we should care about writing, how AI can complement it, and some caveats to consider. Then, I’ll provide a high-level overview of the reDraft process, and go through it step by step on how I used it for my last article, noting what worked well &amp; what I would have done differently.</p><h3>Get behind me, AI writer</h3><p>You’re reading this article, which indicates you value writing already. Writing for our own sakes is important for many reasons too: it organizes our thinking, allows us to contribute our knowledge, and works as a self-teaching mechanism. If you can write about a given subject, it’s clear you understand it. I know many designers &amp; former colleagues in philosophy who have great things to say. My hope is to encourage the would-be writers who have insights to share with a process that fast-tracks them through the drafting stage and into editing.</p><p>That being said, using AI for written work or any creative material is tricky. On the one hand, it can operate as a great on-demand feedback generator. When writing centers are closed — or I’m just not in an easy or quick environment to get feedback — having something give me writing a second look has benefited me greatly. I still believe human feedback is more valuable — especially for brainstorming, style, and tone at least — but it’s nice to have something that compares sources, grammatical mistakes, and mechanics quickly too.</p><p>On the other hand, the temptation is to let AI creep into your work as a co-author or a ghostwriter. While some can differentiate the AI slop from crafted work, it’s becoming more difficult to tell when something is solely generated by AI. At the worst of times, people may just post completely AI-generated content and claim it as their own. I’ll take a firm stance against that approach. So, if you’re expecting an AI-first writing process, I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed. AI comes second here.</p><h3>A tale of two processes</h3><h4><em>Building snowmen</em></h4><p>Before any AI tools, my traditional writing process was more akin to Randy Ingermanson’s <em>Snowflake Method</em>. While that was geared towards long-form fiction, it served me well for nonfiction &amp; academic writing too. The idea was to start with a sentence capturing your general thought, idea, or argument and then continuously expand that sentence into a paragraph, from a paragraph to a page, and so on. It’s a <em>fractal</em> process, like how a snowflake is a fractal shape of itself.² So, I may have started with a thesis statement and then thought through how I needed to support my claim.</p><p>But I had serious struggles — like many others — with writer’s block, uncertain about direction in both my ideas &amp; method, and struggled with getting thoughts to paper even when I knew what I wanted to say. Usually, I enjoy the grind of a process, but I rarely did for writing.</p><h4><em>Throwing clay</em></h4><p>Pairing my tutoring experience with my director’s brilliance, my goal was to standardize his idea into a process to get me back on track with writing. His insight to ‘reverse engineer’ finding relevant sources, could be extrapolated in other areas of writing: drafting, revisions, alt-text, image captions, SEO, etc. Further &amp; most importantly, I wanted to maintain creative ownership, integrity, and approach this process with a solid ethical foundation.</p><p>The phrase <em>reverse-engineered drafting</em> is fitting because it inverts the snowflake method completely: crank out all the content and then clean it up. I rarely would just sit down &amp; write everything without worry for what my overall draft looks like, tone, voice, and grammar — all of which I should care about later in the editing stage. By way of analogy, think of the snowflake method like basket weaving by starting with one long leaf and continuously adding more and more to create a basket.</p><p>Alternatively, the reverse-engineered drafting, or <em>reDraft</em>, process is more akin to throwing clay in the sense that you start with an unformed lump that’s morphed into a pot. I soon realized that early drafts have a lot to offer; and this isn’t exclusive to the reDraft process either. AI can help shed some light through the muck like a writing tutor can help clarify some points that your paper could be saying without robbing the author of ownership.</p><p>I know AI isn’t required for a reverse-engineered approach in the way I’m describing, either; that’s perfectly fine. But for myself, I fall into so many tangents, get into the weeds on details that aren’t pertinent and sometimes end up writing nothing at all. It could take months or years (looking at my publishing history on Medium), before I actually finish a full draft. Just giving myself the permission to work with an unformed lump for a draft, knowing that AI can give me some clear feedbac,k was enough for me to crank out some undercooked, yet fully-baked thoughts.</p><p>If you’re wondering whether I used the reDraft process on this article, I absolutely did. And, of course, I asked AI for feedback on how to standardize &amp; refine the reDraft process too. I have a dedicated Perplexity Space called “Writer’s Room” that runs off the reDraft process. In what’s to come, though, I’ll walk through the process in detail, step by step, in case you’d want to bring it to your frontier model of choice. I’ll also share a link to the custom instructions I use on Perplexity as well.</p><h3>Reverse-engineered drafting</h3><p>With AI’s help, of course, I’ve distilled this down to a 5-step process from conception to submission. Depending on how much I already know about a subject, whether I’m constructing an argument or exploring an idea, the early steps may look slightly different. I’ll explain more when we go into more detail about each step.</p><p>In addition to Perplexity, I use Obsidian to help me keep track of where I’m at in the process with multiple note files as drafts with specific naming conventions. I’ll be sure to share those, too, that I’ll add after each step’s description. For now, let’s look at the process as a whole.</p><h4>reDraft process</h4><ul><li><strong>Step 1: </strong>free-form drafting (1 FF draft)</li><li><strong>Step 2: </strong>rough feedback (2 RF draft)</li><li><strong>Step 3: </strong>revision rounds (3 R# revision)</li><li><strong>Step 4: </strong>quality check (4 QA check</li><li><strong>Step 5: </strong>final review (published title)</li></ul><p>I’ll use my last article, “<a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/useful-ads-7899e1711157"">Designing useful ads</a>,” to walk through each step in more detail since it was both an idea I wanted to explore &amp; to test out this process.³ I’ll share what worked well, learnings from mistakes I made, and some adjustments I did.</p><p>For reference, here’s how I organize my Obsidian notes based on the naming conventions for each of the five steps.</p><figure><img alt=""Sidebar view of an Obsidian-style note list titled “Frontier AI ads,” showing a sequential set of files named “0 idea — advertisements in AI chats,” “1 FF draft — ads in frontier AI,” “2 RF draft — ads in frontier AI,” three “3 R1/R2/R3 revision — ads in frontier AI” entries, “4 QA — ads in frontier AI,” and a final citation-style line, “Walsh, Tanner (2026) Designing useful ads.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yX4JvumR4DZnc2RuDtkS0g.png"" /><figcaption>Obsidian sidebar showing the full reDraft workflow for the “Frontier AI ads” article from initial idea through free‑form draft, rough feedback, three revision rounds, and quality check; and it ends in the final citation for “Designing useful ads.”</figcaption></figure><h4>Step 1: Free-form drafting</h4><blockquote>Instructions:<br /><em>Begin writing without concern for spelling, grammar, or perfect citations. Focus on getting all ideas, arguments, visuals and references onto the page. Loosely note sources or ideas as you write.</em></blockquote><p>This step is about writing &amp; more writing. Get all the ideas on paper with that same reckless abandon, ignoring not only proper citations but also proper grammar, spelling, punctuation, paper structure, and having a clear thesis. Easier said than done, of course; I care too much about spelling &amp; grammar still. Yet, speed is key for step one. The more you have written down, the more you have to work with later.</p><p>With my last article, I began with general ideas and gave each paragraph an H4 heading in Obsidian that captured the thought for me. Because of the outline view and that headings can collapse like accordions, Obsidian makes it easy to quickly track &amp; scan a working draft. Here’s how that looked for me in step one:</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Obisidian article draft in dark‑mode showing the “Intro” section with two subsections and a collapsed accordion section: a “YouTube &amp; Spotify example” paragraph describing how ads slowly appeared on free services and frustrated users, and a “frontier models &amp; search engines” paragraph comparing frontier AI models to search engines with sponsored tags and banner blindness, ending by noting an opportunity to add ads smartly."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MoGTcAbBImMs8vV7a32LPw.png"" /><figcaption>Draft intro section for the frontier AI ads article with H4 headings to convey each paragraph’s idea in Obsidian.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s quick, messy, fairly coherent, but also some word vomit. But that’s the point. I can go back &amp; clean up what I wanted to say about YouTube during the editing stage.</p><h4><em>Reverse-engineering a brainstorm</em></h4><p>There’s another article idea I’m exploring about whether data trackers can help increase virtuous behavior. I have a Garmin watch &amp; a background in philosophy, so I know a bit about data tracking &amp; virtue ethics. What I don’t know is much about how the general data-tracking community might take data tracking to the extreme nor what the ethical implications of that might be. So, I wanted to learn more in two ways: top sources &amp; controversies. For this, I tend to use the following prompt as a starting point:</p><ul><li>“What are the top stories in [subject/topic] and what are people divided on?”</li></ul><p>If I’m just eager to write about <em>something</em> but nothing comes to mind, I might plug in either of these prompts into Perplexity:</p><ul><li>“Here are my interests [list of my interests], what are some topics I could consider writing about?”</li><li>“Generate writing prompts for me to explore based on my interests”</li></ul><p>AI is great for brainstorming &amp; giving some initial direction to start writing from scratch. I keep it ethical by making sure I’m doing the research though, looking through the summarized sources, and thinking about my own stance on the matter. AI is solely providing a general direction for me to do that. And I can narrow my focus, sources, and clarify my own position, taking notes for my Zettlekasten-inspired Obsidian vault to draw from later.</p><h4><em>Visual assets</em></h4><p>Since I work as a UX designer, Figma (and similar tools) works great for quick visuals to illustrate a point or make themed article banners like I have. I’ll create a page in a “writing” file for each article specifically with a component library that maintains a consistent color scheme &amp; typography.</p><figure><img alt=""Figma canvas showing a large black banner with a white roadside billboard mockup that reads “Driver in the red Camry, your left headlight is out. Take Exit 12 for Redline Autoshop. Typical fix for $75–120,” alongside the words “Useful ads,” with smaller UI mockups beneath illustrating conventional and “smart” AI ad responses and contextual panels."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*33L56B9WwY9gJkDmxe0XkA.png"" /><figcaption>Banner &amp; UI explorations for the frontier AI ads article: a “Useful ads” billboard warning a red Camry driver about a broken headlight, paired with AI interface mocks that reframe ads as contextual cards, coupons, and right‑rail panels designed to be genuinely helpful.</figcaption></figure><p>Figma recently added a generic component library making it easy for me to quickly wire out an AI chat interface to illustrate my points &amp; examples. Further, now that more AI features are in Figma, I had an easier time working with placeholder content and didn’t have to use <em>lorem</em> text anywhere. Until I had those visuals ready, I just added placeholders in the draft like so:</p><p>Before having my Perplexity Space give some feedback on it, I polished up the formatting a little by giving each paragraph an H4 heading that I may have missed earlier and clearly explain in my prompt what is meant to be placeholder in my draft. Sometimes the thesis comes later though too, which was true for the AI ads article. So, I’ll quickly take a shot on what point I’m trying to make that I can change up later if needed. For this I started with: <em>ads in AI can be useful and done better</em>. Sure it’s not punchy, that detailed, or even helpful; but it gets my aim in a nutshell.</p><h3>Step 2: Rough feedback</h3><blockquote>Instructions:<em><br />Upload the draft for feedback on:<br />- Structure: Logical flow and overall organization<br />- Thesis/Focus: Clarity and specificity of the central idea<br />- Flesh-out: Fill out details for core argument &amp; ideas<br />- Sources: Relevance and sufficiency of cited material<br />- Blind Spots: Identify missing context, underdeveloped arguments, or evidence</em></blockquote><p>I’ll export the free-form draft as a PDF and begin a thread in my “Writer’s Room” Perplexity Space. I typically write a prompt like this:</p><ul><li>“I have a free-form draft for a new article idea I’m writing as an attached PDF. So step 1 in the reDraft process is done. Provide initial feedback for Step 2. (attached PDF)”</li></ul><p>After all the feedback is generated, I have Perplexity compile it into a list of to-do items for me to tackle too.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of a dark‑mode Perplexity response showing a four‑part “Step 2” revision checklist titled “Thesis / Central Focus,” “Structure &amp; Logical Flow,” “Core Sections &amp; Main Argument,” and “Facts, Sources, &amp; Credibility,” each with short bullet points about clarifying the thesis, adding headings, defining concepts, and verifying sources."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*cbPwA_KItM-yVkJDaaeLnQ.png"" /><figcaption>The Step 2 revision checklist I used for the frontier AI ads article, outlining how to tighten the thesis, restructure sections, flesh out the main argument, and shore up sources before moving on to detailed line edits.</figcaption></figure><p>If I’m struggling with a particular item, I’ll bring it to Perplexity and treat it like a writing tutorial. For example, my initial thesis lacked clarity &amp; direction. So, I asked Perplexity how it might phrase my thesis statement. While tutoring students, I would help them sharpen theses in a similar fashion, going back &amp; forth on several revisions with different wording, sentence structure, aim, and focus. I’d suggest my take on it, then the student would bounce back with theirs. Well, the same is true here:</p><p><strong><em>1 Perplexity’s suggestion:</em></strong></p><figure><img alt=""Close‑cropped dark‑mode chat snippet showing Perplexity’s message: “Got it. How about this as a next draft:” followed by the thesis sentence about advertisements in free services like ChatGPT risking frustration and brand trust while frontier AI models can integrate them smartly into threads and responses, enhancing utility instead of disappearing into banner blindness."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QFGrj0tqdRFqeitmcS9ROA.png"" /><figcaption>Perplexity’s follow-up thesis suggestion for the frontier AI ads article, proposing a version that frames ads as smartly woven into AI threads and responses rather than lost to classic banner blindness.</figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>2 My revision:</em></strong></p><blockquote>While advertisements in any free service risk user frustration &amp; brand trust, frontier AI models have a unique opportunity to subvert user expectations for advertisements in a way that enhances the value of AI threads &amp; responses without compromising utility.</blockquote><p><strong><em>3 Perplexity’s revision:</em></strong></p><figure><img alt=""Dark‑mode chat screenshot showing Perplexity’s message: “Absolutely. Then I’d suggest this final version:” followed by the refined thesis about advertisements in free services like ChatGPT risking frustration and brand trust while frontier AI models can integrate them smartly into threads &amp; responses to enhance utility without compromise or banner blindness."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vJ0sOtsfL2VoboCY5rIOSw.png"" /><figcaption>Perplexity’s last thesis recommendation for the frontier AI ads article, before I did my final two revisions.</figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>4 My revision:</em></strong></p><blockquote>While advertisements in free services like ChatGPT risk frustrating users and harming brand trust, frontier AI models have a unique opportunity to integrate them smartly via sponsored comparisons, optional sub-searches underpinned by UX principles like information scent, information grouping, and signal-to-noise ratio that can enhance utility without compromise.</blockquote><p><strong><em>5 My own final revision:</em></strong></p><blockquote>While advertisements in free services like ChatGPT risk frustrating users and harming brand trust, frontier AI models have a unique opportunity to integrate them smartly into the threads &amp; responses that have the potential to enhance utility without compromise or worry of banner blindness.</blockquote><p>It might be tempting to take AI’s revisions as is, but sometimes the word slop creeps in. So it’s important that you read it carefully &amp; adjust it to your voice &amp; needs — especially for your core argument. Setting up guard rails in your prompting can help curb that temptation &amp; have AI help focus on giving you actionable feedback, as opposed to doing the work for you. Consider explaining what your goals are for a thesis or what you don’t like about it for instance. Good prompts lead to good feedback; and, as Justin Jeffrey reported on students seeking AI feedback, “poor prompts led to weak feedback.”⁴</p><p>While I had to improve some structural changes in the article, Perplexity suggested I keep the general roadmap as is — which was flattering, I guess. But it suggested that I integrate my visuals within the case study &amp; provide analysis paragraphs that explain the design and the principles they adhere to. That suggestion was very insightful, and it was nice to decide how to capitalize on that insight myself.</p><p>Once I had fleshed out some weaker sections and cut redundant ones, it was time to check for ‘plagiarism’ and find some sources. Here’s the gist of the prompt I used:</p><blockquote>“Okay, let’s find sources that are talking about what I’m writing about, referencing or alluding to. And let’s find similar works that are talking about the same topics or ideas as I am.”</blockquote><p>While I saw many folks talking about ads in AI platforms, there didn’t appear to be a lot of discussion on how they could be better for people — admittedly, this could be me relying on AI a bit too much to catch blindspots like that. But with the sources it did recommend, Perplexity gave a brief summary for each one &amp; showed in my draft where each source challenged or complemented a point I was making. For my part, I’d check the source, read through it, and find what was most relevant or helpful or more concrete for my article.</p><p>Last, I asked Perplexity to provide a Chicago-style bibliography citation of the source for me to track references at the end of the draft and making sure the right information is included &amp; hyperlinked if needed.</p><h3>Step 3: Revision rounds</h3><blockquote>Instructions:<em><br />Compile feedback into action items for the following categories</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Round 1: Structure and Organization</em></strong><em><br />- Refine thesis or focus statement.<br />- Ensure logical flow and coherence.<br />- Organize sections with clear headings and subheadings.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Round 2: Paragraphing and Clarity<br />- </em></strong><em>Improve topic sentences and transitions.<br />- Clarify arguments and evidence.<br />- Ensure each paragraph supports the main idea.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Round 3: Sentence-level Polish<br />- </em></strong><em>Refine sentence structure for clarity and readability.<br />- Correct grammar, punctuation, spelling, and syntax.<br />- Adjust word choice, tone, and style for the intended audience.</em></blockquote><p><strong><em>Embarrassing but honest disclaimer:</em></strong><em> </em>Admittedly, I didn’t go through the three rounds as I laid out above. Perplexity’s custom instructions weren’t as solidified at this point, and I conflated a lot of steps 2 &amp; 3 together where I lost a good bit of focus on what I was doing. And the same is true for steps 4 &amp; 5 too, but I’ll table that for now. For the remainder of this section, read what I <em>should</em> have done instead.</p><h4>Round 1</h4><p>Here, the focus is on tying ideas together, being consistent, and making sure the draft is complete from start to finish. I’ll begin by first collapsing all paragraph headings between the introduction &amp; conclusion sections to get an overview of the narrative flow, and then revise the intro or conclusion as needed.</p><p>The rest of round one is spent examining how a section ties to the previous &amp; following sections, and then how each paragraph ties to the previous &amp; following ones. Having labelled each paragraph topic saved time by allowing me to glance at how the paragraphs relate to each other, cut them if they don’t, or reorganize them if there’s a better fitting spot.</p><p>For example, it was time to explain how the UX principles applied to my lo-fi content cards in a few analysis paragraphs. This began with a list of principles and some rough definitions of them that later merged into analysis paragraphs near the visual design:</p><p><strong><em>Before:</em></strong></p><figure><img alt=""Dark‑mode editor screenshot showing a short paragraph about “being smart with a few principles” followed by four bulleted definitions: information grouping, information scent, banner blindness, and signal‑to‑noise ratio, with a final bracketed note about adding wires or sketches later."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gm9XUTSI81ByIITN901J8Q.png"" /><figcaption>Draft section defining the four UX principles that guide “useful ads” in frontier AI (information grouping, information scent, banner blindness, and signal‑to‑noise ratio) before moving into interface sketches and wireframes.</figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>After:</em></strong></p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of explanatory copy above a Figma‑style card mockup for “BrightSpark Electrical,” showing a star rating, price tag reading “$4000,” short company description, “Read reviews” link, and two buttons labeled “Free inspection coupon” and “Request service.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/998/1*G-Ib-XBbdLnn0zbHhD2PCw.png"" /><figcaption>The merged example of a “smart ad” card for an electrician that integrates the design principles in the analysis paragraph above it.</figcaption></figure><h4>Round 2</h4><p>Now that the ideas connect and the story is consistent, it’s time to polish the formatting. I’ll start thinking through names for each section or at least a phrase that explains what the section talks about. Eventually, my hope is that I’ll come up with something clever or cheesy — like Lewis &amp; Clark themed section headings on how to <em>trailblaze</em> the <em>frontier</em> for <em>frontier</em> AI advertisements. While there seemingly isn’t a lot for this round, finalizing the larger essay structure &amp; themes would allow me to hone in on the finer details now.</p><h4>Round 3</h4><p>If anyone caught my case study article immediately after it published, you’ll know that I overlooked a lot I needed to do in this round. Unfortunately, I can’t blame the sloppy writing on AI either since it’s directly from my rougher drafts — at least it’s <em>my</em> slop though. Again, learn from my mistakes; never skip sentence-level edit day.</p><p>While the tasks might differ from article to article, some things were already done more or less like thesis statement revisions, case study coherence, and so on. So what I have above was how I approached each task per round.</p><p>This round has a higher workload than the others, as the focus is to go through each paragraph &amp; tighten up the sentences, flow, and grammar for a cleaner polish. Usually, I aim to keep sentences as short as I can without losing clarity of the ideas. But making sure your tone, voice, and style are showcased is most important.</p><p>If needed, take one section at a time. I’ve learned it’s better not to approach this round all at once, too. All the writing &amp; structure is there, so it’s easier to come back and know what’s left to do after a break from editing. Once I’m satisfied with the sentences, coherence, and structure of the paragraph, I’ll delete the paragraph headings then move to the next section. For me, this gives me the sense of completion for what sections are revised and indicates that I’ve given this some close attention at the sentence level too.</p><p>So, after three rounds of editing, I’ll move into the next step in the process. At this point, I should have my draft in good shape, my visuals replaced the placeholder spots, and trimmed down the excess content I don’t need.</p><h3>Step 4: Quality check</h3><blockquote>Instructions:<br /><em>Check that your draft meets the following criteria before publishing<br />- Clear and specific thesis or focus<br />- Logical and coherent structure<br />- Credible and well-integrated evidence<br />- Readable and engaging style<br />- No major errors in grammar or mechanics<br />- Visual appeal and formatting where appropriate<br />- Strong conclusion (summary, call to action, or takeaway)<br />- Relevant tags or SEO if publishing online<br />- Banner image<br />- Article title &amp; subtitle</em></blockquote><p>Many of the tasks here may feel they’ve already been done. But it’s nice to have Step 4 as another round of feedback from Perplexity to catch my gaffs that I’ll miss in Obsidian or just mistakes I plainly overlooked. As Riwa By claims, AI goes beyond a traditional spellchecker because it can “analyze entire sentences, understand context, suggest rephrasing, and… match tone and intent,” making it a solid writing tutor.⁵</p><p>With what AI can do now, there’s really no excuse for leaving out alt-text &amp; captions for visuals. At the very least, I think there’s an argument for having this content generated — especially if the visuals are your own work or if you want to properly reference copyrighted imagery. But if you want to keep things in your own words, draft the captions, alt-text, and SEO descriptions of the article too. The AI tutor can give solid feedback on this also for screen reader users and teasing out details in captions that might be subtle in the imagery.</p><p>What’s unique to this section, though, is coming up with a title. I would spend way too much time crafting a title &amp; subtitle before I had even the idea fully formed in my head. However, with the reDraft process, content comes first &amp; cool titles come after. For the AI ads article, I threw some of my rough title ideas at Perplexity to refine further:</p><ul><li>“AI Trailblazing: the final AI frontier”</li><li>“Helpful marketing: how AI can make ads useful”</li><li>“UX for ads: AI’s unique opportunity”</li></ul><p>I ended up with “Useful ads: Trailblazing UX for Frontier AI” but quickly realized that’s a very vague title that doesn’t convey much. So I quickly changed it to “Designing useful ads” and the good folks at <em>UX Collective</em> provided a cleaner, more descriptive subtitle (thank you!): “Redefining the relationship between AI utility and digital advertising.” Thankfully, I didn’t have to rework my article banner image, since I usually don’t have those matching one-to-one with the title anyway.</p><h3>Step 5: Final review</h3><p>For my own peace of mind, I’ll have Perplexity review it one last time, providing exactly what I’d put in Medium’s draft page. However, since most AI platforms probably could offer endless feedback for ‘improvement,’ I had included in the Perplexity custom instructions to say when something is ‘good enough for my purposes.’ I’m not trying to be the next Dostoyevsky or Nobel Prize winner, so I can strive for excellence on my own standards rather than absolute perfection.</p><p>But if you — like me — eagerly tried a new writing process and noticed a lot of mistakes after it’s posted, I have two thoughts. First, Medium thankfully allows edits after posting; I can make some minor tweaks, fix grammar, or correct mistakes that I come across. Second &amp; more generally speaking, even if you can’t (or shouldn’t) make changes, I’m comfortable with saying that was not my best work &amp; can do better next time. Even though I notice things in my very first Medium article that I want to change or improve, I’m resisting the temptation and trying to lean into my own advice.</p><h4>Don’t just eat fish, learn how to fish</h4><p>While AI can be easily abused for any creative process, it can remove a lot of friction while maintaining human ownership of a work. It just has to be done with care &amp; self-restraint on what we allow AI to do for us. The goal is to identify clear boundaries in prompts &amp; instructions so that we focus more on our ideas, style, and prose.</p><p>More work does need to be done on a process like this for more stringent, professional work. The reDraft could be a decent start which academics could refine further — keeping the ethics, ownership, and standards honest for peer-review publications.</p><p>For newer writers, it may be more challenging to pushback against an AI tutor also. The <em>Enago Academy</em> warns that these platforms sound very confident, tout expertise, and have convincing explanations even when they’re factually wrong. But sources are linked in AI responses; click the links, skim the sources, and make your own judgement — especially for topics you’re still learning. Your name is on the byline for what you post online regardless if you had human or AI feedback.¹ Thus, it’s important to couch AI as an assistant, a librarian, and as a tutor that gives <em>suggestions</em> as opposed to gospel.</p><p>I love learning new things, and I don’t do myself nor my readers any good by having AI generate content I know nothing about. The old proverb “give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime” applies to AI creativity too. Write for yourself to understand new ideas, pay attention to what feedback AI gives you, and improve your writing style. In Jeffrey’s study, he found that AI helped students improve their writing where “82% reported improved error recognition” and “80% noticed details they typically missed.”⁴ AI can give you a full article to share in minutes, but it can also teach you how to write one yourself.</p><blockquote><strong>AI usage disclaimer</strong>:<em> AI tools were used for editing visual assets, writing feedback, assistance in locating relevant sources, &amp; Chicago-style citation formatting; all early drafts, ideas, arguments, &amp; experiences in this article are my own.</em></blockquote><h3>References</h3><ul><li>Link to <a href=""https://1drv.ms/w/c/369b550a350cb50a/IQCJ0YrsXADQTaamDDJ2kmC3AY5dQuZYKD3lm92JmwqpuUQ?e=bhLFTw"">custom instructions</a> for Perplexity Space.</li></ul><p>[1] Enago Academy. “AI in Academic Writing: How to Use Technology Without Losing Your Voice.” <em>Enago Academy</em>, December 14, 2025. <a href=""https://www.enago.com/academy/ai-in-academic-writing-how-to-use-technology-without-losing-your-voice/"">https://www.enago.com/academy/ai-in-academic-writing-how-to-use-technology-without-losing-your-voice/.</a></p><p>[2] Ingermanson, Randy. <em>How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method</em>.

<p>I started <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/summer-fridays-flushed-lip-stain-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">wearing makeup</a> at 13, but I can count on one hand the lipsticks I’ve used all the way to the last swipe. Over the years, very few have ever given me exactly what I want — and I don’t think I’m asking for much. I want my lipstick to feel moisturizing on my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-peptide-lip-treatment-balm"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">chronically dry lips</a>, stay where I put it without ending up on my teeth, lend a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/blur-makeup-trend-products"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">soft, blurred, diffused effect</a>, and not break the bank entirely. That’s exactly why I’ve fallen head over heels for <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Merit’s Signature Lip Blush</a>. </p>



<h2>What is Merit’s Signature Lip Blush and what are the benefits? </h2>



<p><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Signature Lip Blush</a> is the latest addition to Merit’s growing lip lineup. You might know — and love — its <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/merit-beauty-products-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Signature Lipstick,</a> which occupies a cozy space between matte and glossy, giving lips a subtle satin-like glint. Or perhaps the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/merit-beauty-products-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shade Slick lip oil</a> is a staple in your handbag. <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"">Signature Lip Blush</a>, however, dials the shine all the way back. </p>



<p>Merit describes <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"">Signature Lip Blush</a> as a “sheer matte lightweight, buildable formula with a comfortable, balm-like feel”. To me, it’s a soft matte lipstick that’s not too dissimilar from a lip stain — packed with pigment — or a lip pencil, which you can diffuse with your fingers or a brush.  </p>



<p>If you’re just as obsessed as I am with celebrity makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ninapark/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nina Park</a>, specifically the way she makes her clients’ lips appear contoured, plump, and diffused, then I have a feeling you’re going to love this lipstick. On application, it’s sheer and light enough to blend outward, but unlike others with a similar texture, once it dries down a little, it clings to lips for a good four hours without disappearing into nothingness. </p>



<p>That’s all down to what Merit calls gel-wrapped pigments — essentially molecules of color encapsulated in a gel-like texture that makes swiping and blending easy. Speaking of color, there are eight shades in total, spanning Andie (a delicate petal pink) to Gamay (a deep red wine). Here, I’m wearing September, a muted terracotta, paired with Merit’s <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-liner%3F_pos%3D1%26_psq%3DSignature%2BLip%2BLiner%26_ss%3De%26_v%3D1.0"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Signature Lip Liner in Mayfair,</a> a peachy mauve. I will say the lipstick bullet appears a little darker than it does on the lips.</p>

<h2>What makes Merit’s Signature Lip Blush Special? </h2>



<p>What sets <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"">Merit’s Signature Lip Blush</a> apart from other soft matte lipsticks is how it feels on. Most matte products dry out my parched lips even further, settling into — and accentuating — lines and creases. This one feels so comforting, it’s like wearing a lip balm — all without any stickiness. You can thank sesame seed extract, nourishing olive oil, and plant-based waxes for that. </p>



<p>I judge makeup first and foremost on how it makes me feel, but when others notice, it’s affirming. Since giving <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"">Signature Lip Blush</a> a trial run these past few weeks, I’ve had countless compliments on my lipstick, with beauty editor peers repeatedly asking what I’m wearing — we’re convinced it makes my lips appear bigger. </p>



<h2>What to know about Merit’s Signature Lip Blush:</h2>



<p>• Sheer, matte lipstick with a moisturizing balm-like feel. </p>



<p>• Available in eight shades from rose brown through to bordeaux.  </p>



<p>•  Lends a diffused, blurred finish to lips and stays put for hours. </p>



<h2>How do you use Merit’s Signature Lip Blush? </h2>



<p>Because <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Signature Lip Blush</a> is so balm-like, I don’t have to be precise when I apply it. Usually, I line my lips and even use a lip brush before any lipstick, but with this, I can swipe it on haphazardly — without a mirror — and still end up with perfect, pillowy lips. Maybe that’s the blurred-lip trend talking, but the texture makes it so easy. </p>



<p>If you’re applying it a little more thoughtfully, it looks even better paired with a darker lip pencil and blurred ever so slightly over the lines, again lending that Nina Park effect. I love that the lipstick bullet boasts a squoval shape, which makes light work of tracing your lip line if you don’t have a lip pencil to hand. </p>



<p>Ultimately, this is the perfect lipstick for lipstick skeptics and obsessives alike — low-maintenance, wearable, and hard to mess up. I currently have three in my handbag.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959389.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Rejoice! As we enter Pisces season, we’re also getting closer to spring. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/february-monthly-horoscope-2026-meanings-effects"">From February 18th to March 20th</a>, the sun will be splashing around in the enigmatic water sign of Pisces, heightening our intuition, and creativity. This year, Pisces season brings wisdom, reflection, and a lot of wildness in between. Things are going to get messy, so prepare for the drama-of-it-all. Before we get sea sick from the rapid changes, it’s important to learn how to flow with ease through the turbulent waters ahead. Luckily, the stars and planets will <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">help us predict the journey</a>.</p>



<p>In previous years, Saturn and Neptune have added restriction and paranoia to the mix when the sun was in Pisces. Now, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/saturn-in-aries-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Saturn and Neptune are in Aries</a>, still stirring up problems, but not making us insecure and unsure about the road ahead. February 20th brings the conjunction of the two, urging us to pursue our dreams at any cost — even if it means hurting others in the process. We aren’t going to stand idly by and watch situations unfold; we’re going to take an active approach to drive change. We are more confident, aggressive, tenacious, and tougher than before.</p>



<p>For the first part of the solar return, there will be a stellium in mystical Pisces (the sun, Mercury, Venus, and Mars). We’ll be stubborn in our delusions, only accepting our reality as the correct one, which is problematic. As a result, arguments can ensue, especially if we do not back down. Finding the middle ground is useful; however, it’ll be difficult to understand others when we put our desires first and throw logic out the window. Taking a beat to center our energy requires patience and consideration — sentiments we may be lacking in the heat of the moment. </p>



<p>Mercury retrograde in Pisces begins on February 26th and lasts until March 20th, when the sun ingresses into Aries, and the spring equinox melts the ice away. The Mercurial moonwalk is going to raise our anxieties from the immense miscommunications and frenetic vibes. The universe wants us to go inwards, allowing us to focus on internal healing. Former partners will resurface, promising the world, when they have no intention of staying. Things are feeling intangible, and the wishy-washiness makes us lose our way. Choosing compassion connects us to people and gives us the strength to rise above the tides.</p>



<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">total lunar eclipse in Virgo</a> on March 3rd keeps our head above water by offering a chance to have a pragmatic approach to resolving matters. The blood moon is letting us see through the darkness, like a lighthouse illuminates the ocean, keeping us afloat. The caveat is that lunar eclipses are fast and furious, so the information being brought to our attention might shake us up, forcing us to make decisions. The retrograde pauses us from being direct or able to cut off the negativity, leaving us riddled with confusion, disillusionment, and frustration. I told you it was going to be chaotic! </p>

<h3>Key Astrological Dates For Pisces Season: </h3>



<p><strong>February 18th:</strong> The sun enters Pisces, making us tender, imaginative, romantic, and sentimental. Our hearts and emotions guide the way forward.</p>



<p><strong>February 20th:</strong> Saturn conjuncts Neptune in Aries, allowing this once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon to bring evolution and a metamorphosis on a global level. Outdated systems fall and new ones emerge.</p>



<p><strong>February 26th:</strong> Mercury Retrograde in Pisces commences, bringing travel issues, missed texts or emails, and the revival of old foes or exes for another hurrah (if we let them). </p>



<p><strong>March 2nd:</strong> Mars enters Pisces, pushing us to rebel and assert our views — although, we’ll have a few doubts about what we want to fight for or pursue.</p>



<p><strong>March 3rd:</strong> The lunar eclipse in Virgo is a moment of clarity and truth. How we react and deal with the energy will augment and shift our lives. </p>



<p><strong>March 6th: </strong>Venus enters Aries, motivating us to take the lead in relationships and to pursue our dreams.</p>



<p><strong>March 10th:</strong> Jupiter in Cancer ends the retrograde cycle that began on November 11th, 2025. Abundance and luck are coming!</p>



<p><strong>March 18th:</strong> The New Moon in Pisces is an opportunity to manifest our hopes and goals for the new season that comes two days later.</p>

<p>Black hair has a way of carrying everything. Memory. Care. Pressure. Pride. Each ritual rooted in purpose. On this episode of <em>Go Off, Sis</em>, the conversation feels less like an interview and more like a collective exhale, as the hosts dig into the rituals, rules, and quiet truths that shape Black women’s hair journeys.</p>



<p>The episode is presented in partnership with <strong><a href=""https://www.target.com/c/celebrate-black-history-month/-/https://www.target.com/c/celebrate-black-history-month/-/N-bw2fbN-bw2fb"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Target</a></strong> and their Black History Month Collection, which highlights the power, purpose, and intention behind Black founders and the communities that inspire them. The connection is clear in this conversation, which highlights women whose careers are rooted in care, access, and showing up for Black communities in tangible ways.</p>



<p>Beauty founder <strong><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/darealbbjudy/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jesseca Dupart</a></strong> brings the perspective of someone who understands hair as both personal and collective. Her approach to building has always extended beyond products. It is about creating tools that help Black women feel confident, supported, and seen, especially in spaces where their needs have historically been overlooked. Her work and products show community impact matters just as much as innovation.</p>



<p>That sense of care and purpose becomes deeply tangible with celebrity hairstylist<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lacyredway/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> </a><strong><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lacyredway/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lacy Redway</a></strong>, whose stories blur the line between ritual and profession. Growing up Jamaican, she remembers sitting between her sister’s legs every Sunday as her hair was washed, twisted, and prepped for the week. When the hosts chime in with memories of familiar wash-day routines, the moment feels instantly shared, grounding the conversation in experiences many Black women recognize.</p>



<p>As an adult working across red carpets, magazine covers, and film sets, Redway says that intimacy never disappears. “We’re not just doing hair. We’re creating safety,” she explains, describing the trust required when working with clients in industries where Black hair is still misunderstood or minimized. From editorial shoots to major premieres, she continues to push back against narrow ideas of what is considered professional or feminine, reminding us that textured hair does not need to be tamed to be worthy.</p>



<p>Throughout the episode, the conversation returns to a simple truth. Choice matters. Whether worn natural, braided, relaxed, covered, or completely undone, Black women deserve the freedom to decide how they show up without explanation.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955795.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>R29 babes, this week begins in the dark of the moon, and we can all feel it. In the days leading up to the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, emotions run high beneath the surface, even as many people pretend they’re unfazed. This is a charged combination. The Dark Moon is always a liminal space, a threshold where fears, insecurities, and unspoken truths rise up, both personally and collectively. You may notice avoidance, dissociation, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/therapy-healing-relationship-family-friends-impact"">or emotional numbness</a> as coping mechanisms. The invitation here is honesty, at least with yourself. What are you afraid of losing? Where have you been trying to stay neutral when neutrality no longer feels possible? This is not the week to bypass discomfort. It’s the week to witness it.</p>



<p>Everything shifts on February 17th, when the Aquarius Solar Eclipse strikes and the Year of the Fire Horse officially begins. This eclipse is electric, disruptive, and unapologetically revolutionary, especially because it squares Uranus, one of Aquarius’ ruling forces. On a collective level, this is volatile energy. Expect an uptick in unrest, protests, system shocks, and visible attempts by entrenched power structures to hold on tighter as their foundations crack. Aquarius eclipses do not negotiate with empires. They expose them. This square makes it clear that staying on the sidelines is no longer an option. Over the next six months, people will be forced to choose where they stand. Comfort, compliance, and silence become increasingly uncomfortable positions to maintain.</p>



<p>And yet, just as the revolution peaks, the cosmos reminds us to keep our hearts open. On February 18th, Pisces Season begins, and the sky fills with a powerful Pisces stellium. The sun, moon, Mercury, Venus, and the North Node all gather in Pisces, creating a countercurrent of compassion, empathy, and spiritual remembrance. This is not weakness. This is medicine. While Aquarius agitates and Aries ignites, Pisces insists that healing, love, and imagination remain central. This stellium asks us to believe in the best-case scenario even when the world feels like it’s cracking. It urges us to grieve what’s ending, tend to collective trauma, and remember that liberation without heart becomes hollow.</p>



<p>The week culminates on February 20th with a rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries, a once-in-a-generation alignment that fuses vision with responsibility. On a personal level, this can feel like a calling, a moment where dreams stop being abstract and demand action. Many people will feel compelled to step into leadership, creativity, or courage in new ways. Collectively, this alignment can catalyze the birth of movements, bold initiatives, and new identities rooted in purpose. The shadow is ego inflation, savior complexes, or mistaking impulse for destiny. The higher path is conscious courage: act from integrity, not adrenaline. This week reminds us that revolution isn’t just about tearing down what no longer works. It’s about building what comes next, with intention, imagination, and care.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, the week opens in the dark of the moon, and for you, this stirs the part of life tied to friendships, communities, and social dynamics. If the vibes have felt oﬀ lately, trust that you’re not imagining it. With Saturn and Neptune now in your sign, you’re more visible than usual, and visibility attracts everything… admiration, curiosity, and yes, sometimes jealousy. As we move through the final days of the Year of the Snake, this is a powerful time to release old alliances, unspoken tensions, or the need to prove yourself within certain circles. You don’t need to confront everything. Quietly choosing distance is just as effective.</p>



<p>Everything resets on February 17th, when the Aquarius Solar Eclipse <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/making-friends-connections-adulthood"">activates your friendship</a> and community realm. This is a fresh start. Over the next six months, you’ll either deepen bonds with true ride-or-dies or meet people who align with the version of you that’s emerging now. This eclipse can also accelerate your digital visibility. You may feel called to join a new collective, show up more online, or even create your own community or platform. If your circle feels small right now, don’t panic. This eclipse is planting seeds. Trust that the right people will find you as you step forward more authentically.</p>



<p>The energy softens on February 18th as Pisces Season begins, inviting you inward for reflection, spiritual integration, and rest. This gentler tone pairs powerfully with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in your sign on February 20th, a once-in-a-generation moment of identity transformation. Saturn asks you to take yourself seriously, while Neptune reminds you to stay connected to hope, imagination, and faith. Together, they mark the beginning of a long chapter where your dreams are no longer abstract. They’re asking to be lived. This week is not about having all the answers. It’s about trusting who you’re becoming and allowing your identity to evolve with intention, courage, and compassion.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, this is the kind of week you end up writing a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/01/11636388/daily-journaling-mental-health-benefits"">fifteen-page journal entry</a> about and still feel like you’ve only scratched the surface. As the week opens in the dark of the moon, your focus turns inward toward your career, reputation, and long-term direction. You may find yourself spiraling a bit, questioning whether the path you’re on is still worth the energy it demands. With the final days of the Year of the Snake wrapping up, this is a release moment. Titles, expectations, or goals that once felt motivating may suddenly feel heavy or outdated. Letting go now isn’t failure, it’s discernment.</p>



<p>The turning point arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which brings an undeniable aha moment around your public life and sense of purpose. This eclipse pushes you toward innovation and authenticity. You may feel inspired to pivot professionally, redefine success, or take a bold step that aligns more closely with your values. Over the next six months, this eclipse can radically change how you show up in the world, especially if you’ve been playing it safe to maintain stability. Growth now requires courage, not comfort.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, the energy softens and shifts toward friendships, networks, and shared visions for the future. You may feel drawn to people who feel emotionally safe, spiritually aligned, or creatively inspiring. This gentler tone pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating a more introspective zone of solitude, healing, and spiritual depth. This is about learning to trust your inner world rather than fear it. Your intuition is strengthening, not to overwhelm you, but to guide you. The more you honor quiet reflection this week, the clearer your next direction becomes.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, this is one of those weeks where your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-get-a-good-sleep-reclaiming-rest"">brain is doing backflips</a> at 2 a.m. and suddenly everything feels <em>philosophical</em>. As the week opens in the dark of the moon, the spotlight turns to your beliefs, future plans, and the big “where am I actually going?” questions. You may feel restless, disillusioned, or torn between multiple paths. That’s not a sign you’re lost — it’s a sign something old is ready to go. In these final days of the Year of the Snake, release outdated narratives about who you’re supposed to be or what success is supposed to look like. You don’t need all the answers yet, just honesty with yourself.</p>



<p>Everything shifts on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which hits this same realm of growth, travel, education, and long-term vision. This is a genuine reset. Over the next six months, you may say yes to a new direction, commit to learning something transformative, relocate, publish, teach, or radically change your worldview. The square to Uranus means the pivot may come suddenly or feel slightly chaotic at first, but it’s freeing. This eclipse doesn’t want you stuck in analysis paralysis. It wants movement, even if the map isn’t fully drawn yet.</p>



<p>The energy softens on February 18th as Pisces Season begins, pulling your focus toward career, visibility, and your public voice. Your intuition starts guiding professional decisions more than logic alone. This blends powerfully with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating your community, networks, and long-term goals. You’re learning which dreams are worth committing to and which circles actually support your growth. Spiritually and socially, this is a maturation moment. You’re not here to float between possibilities forever. You’re here to choose a direction that feels meaningful and build toward it with intention.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955474.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cancer, this is one of those weeks where <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-intuition-gut-instinct-personal-safety"">your intuition is louder</a> than everyone else’s opinions combined, even if you’re trying to ignore it. As the week opens in the dark of the moon, deep emotional material rises around trust, intimacy, and shared resources. You may feel more sensitive than usual, or suddenly aware of where you’ve been over-giving, over-functioning, or holding emotional weight that isn’t yours to carry. With the Year of the Snake coming to a close, this is a powerful release window. Let go of attachments that drain you, even if part of you feels guilty doing so. Emotional boundaries are the medicine right now.</p>



<p>The breakthrough comes on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which activates a major reset around healing, vulnerability, and energetic exchange. Over the next six months, you may redefine how you share space, money, emotions, or power with others. This eclipse can bring sudden clarity around debts, dependencies, or emotional entanglements that need to be transformed. It’s uncomfortable at first, but ultimately liberating. You’re learning that closeness doesn’t have to mean self-sacrifice, and independence doesn’t have to mean isolation.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, the energy shifts in your favor, opening a gentler chapter focused on faith, learning, travel, and spiritual expansion. This flows beautifully with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, which activates your career and life-direction realm. You’re being asked to blend intuition with responsibility and dream with structure. Leadership may feel intimidating, but it’s calling you anyway. This week helps you trust that you can step into visibility without losing your emotional integrity. You’re not meant to hide right now. You’re meant to lead with care.</p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, this week feels like the plot twist you didn’t ask for but secretly needed. As the week opens in the dark of the moon, your relationships take center stage and not in a casual way. You may feel tension, distance, or emotional uncertainty around partners, close friends, or collaborators. This is the final stretch of the Year of the Snake, and it’s asking you to shed relationship dynamics that drain your vitality or keep you performing instead of being real. If something feels off, trust that instinct. You’re not meant to carry connections that dim your light anymore.</p>



<p>The reset arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, landing directly in your relationship realm. This is a big one. Over the next six months, your approach to partnership will radically evolve. New people may enter your life suddenly, or existing relationships may need to renegotiate terms around freedom, equality, and authenticity. With Uranus squaring this eclipse, expect surprises. Not all of them are comfortable, but they are necessary. This eclipse asks you to stop clinging to what looks good on paper and start choosing what actually supports your growth.</p>



<p>The tone shifts on February 18th as Pisces Season begins, pulling your focus toward healing, intimacy, and emotional honesty. This pairs powerfully with the rare Saturn– Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating your beliefs, values, and long-term vision. You’re learning to balance hope with discernment and passion with wisdom. This week reminds you that true confidence doesn’t come from controlling outcomes. It comes from trusting yourself enough to adapt, grow, and let relationships evolve alongside you.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Virgo, this is one of those weeks where your nervous system knows what your mind is still trying to rationalize. As the week opens in the dark of the moon, your focus turns to routines, health, work dynamics, and the way you spend your energy day to day. You may notice fatigue, irritation, or a strong urge to clean up systems that feel inefficient or draining. This is the final stretch of the Year of the Snake, and it’s asking you to shed habits that keep you busy but not fulfilled. You don’t need to fix everything at once. You just need to be honest about what’s no longer sustainable.</p>



<p>The turning point arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which resets your relationship with work, wellness, and service. Over the next six months, you may change jobs, shift schedules, adopt new health practices, or redefine what productivity actually means for you. With Uranus squaring this eclipse, the changes may feel sudden or disruptive at first, but they’re designed to free you from rigid expectations. This eclipse reminds you that efficiency without alignment <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/burnout-at-work-recovery-tips"">leads to burnout</a>. You’re allowed to design a life that works for your body and your spirit.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, attention shifts to your relationships and one-on-one connections. This softer energy blends with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating deep themes around trust, vulnerability, and shared commitments. You’re learning how to balance discernment with openness. This week encourages you to let others meet you halfway rather than carrying everything yourself. You don’t have to be the strong one all the time. Growth now comes from collaboration, not perfection.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Libra, this week opens with a subtle but emotionally charged dark of the moon, stirring your creative life, romantic longings, and desire for joy. You may feel strangely restless, uninspired, or unsure about where your passion has gone. That’s not a block, it’s a clearing. In these final days of the Year of the Snake, you’re being asked to release old narratives around love, attention, and validation. If something no longer feels fun, playful, or heart-expanding, it’s okay to admit that. This is a moment to let go of performative pleasure and reconnect with what genuinely lights you up.</p>



<p>Everything shifts on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which resets this same realm of romance, creativity, and self-expression. Over the next six months, you’re entering a new chapter around how you love, create, and take up space. This eclipse can spark a sudden romantic development, creative breakthrough, or renewed relationship with your inner child. With Uranus squaring the eclipse, expect surprises. You may feel pushed to take risks emotionally or creatively, even if it feels uncomfortable at first. The lesson here is freedom. You’re learning that joy doesn’t need permission.</p>



<p>The tone changes on February 18th as Pisces Season begins, redirecting attention toward your daily rhythms, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/salary-story-illness-work-life-balance"">work-life balance</a>, and emotional well-being. This softer energy pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating long-term shifts in your partnership and commitment zone. Big relationship themes are unfolding, starting with how you show up for yourself. This week reminds you that sustainable love and creativity come from alignment, not overcompromise. Let pleasure be honest. Let love be real.</p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, this week begins with a quiet confrontation between who you’ve been and who you’re becoming. As we move through the dark of the moon, old insecurities tied to home, family, and your emotional roots may resurface. You might notice familiar patterns trying to replay themselves, especially in these final days of the Year of the Snake. This isn’t a setback — it’s a moment of recognition. You’re being shown what no longer deserves repetition. The work here is awareness, not self-judgment. You can’t break a cycle you refuse to name.</p>



<p>The turning point arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which activates deep shifts around home, belonging, and emotional safety, while squaring Uranus in your partnership zone. This is liberating energy, even if it feels uncomfortable at first. Over the next six months, you may break free from relationship dynamics that mirror old wounds or finally speak truths you’ve been holding back. Some connections will strengthen because of honesty, while others may fall away because they can’t evolve with you. Either outcome is aligned. This eclipse asks you to choose emotional freedom over familiarity.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, your focus softens toward love, creativity, pleasure, and self-expression. This is a welcome shift after the intensity of the eclipse. It pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating your daily life, work habits, and long-term sustainability. You’re gaining momentum, but the lesson now is pacing. You don’t need to prove anything by overextending yourself. Structure and inspiration can coexist without burnout. This week teaches you that transformation is most powerful when it’s steady, intentional, and kind to your nervous system.</p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, this week feels like a mental and emotional reset that you didn’t know you needed until it arrived. As we move through the dark of the moon, your attention turns to communication, thought patterns, and the stories you tell yourself about where you’re headed. Old narratives, especially ones rooted in fear, comparison, or self-doubt, may resurface in these final days of the Year of the Snake. This is your cue to release them. You’re outgrowing a version of yourself that needed constant reassurance. Trust that clarity will follow honesty.</p>



<p>The breakthrough arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, activating your realm of learning, writing, speaking, and daily exchanges. Over the next six months, your voice evolves. You may launch a project, commit to sharing your ideas more publicly, or shift the way you communicate in close relationships. The square to Uranus brings sudden insights and unexpected conversations that push you out of your comfort zone. Say the thing. Ask the question. This eclipse reminds you that growth happens when curiosity outweighs fear.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, attention turns inward toward home, emotional safety, and the spaces that ground you. This softer energy pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating creativity, romance, and passion projects. You’re learning how to bring structure to joy and commitment to what you love. Just be mindful not to overdo it… inspiration doesn’t require exhaustion. This week teaches you that sustainable happiness comes from choosing depth over excess and meaning over momentum.</p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, this week begins with a reckoning around worth, security, and what you’re truly building toward. As we move through the dark of the moon, financial concerns, self-esteem patterns, or lingering fears around stability may rise to the surface. In these final days of the Year of the Snake, you’re being asked to release scarcity thinking and outdated definitions of success. If something has required too much effort for too little return, this is your signal. Letting go now creates space for a more aligned foundation to form.</p>



<p>The shift arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, activating your money and values realm. Over the next six months, you may experience a reset around income, priorities, or how you measure your own worth. With Uranus squaring this eclipse, changes may come unexpectedly. A new opportunity, a sudden expense, or a wake-up call around what truly matters could alter your path. This eclipse pushes you to innovate rather than cling to what’s familiar. Security now comes from adaptability, not control.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, your focus softens toward communication, learning, and emotional expression. This pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction on February 20th, activating deep shifts around home, family, and inner emotional structures. As a Saturn-ruled sign, you’re especially sensitive to this moment. You’re learning to build strength without rigidity and responsibility without emotional shutdown. This week reminds you that true resilience comes from honoring both your ambition and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/02/11275205/how-to-sleep-when-stressed-tips"">your need for rest</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, this week is personal in a way you can’t intellectualize your way out of. As the week opens in the dark of the moon in your sign, and the emotional focus lands directly on you… your identity, your body, your sense of self. You may feel unusually sensitive, exposed, or unsure of how you’re being perceived. That’s because something fundamental is shedding. In these final days of the Year of the Snake, you’re releasing an old version of yourself that learned how to survive, not necessarily how to thrive. Let the discomfort speak. It’s showing you where growth is overdue.</p>



<p>Everything changes on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse in your sign, a major reset that will echo for the next six months. This eclipse marks a turning point in how you show up in the world. With the eclipse squaring Uranus, one of your ruling planets, expect disruption, breakthroughs, and moments that force honesty. You may feel pulled between who you’ve been and who you’re becoming, especially in relation to home, family, or emotional security. This is not a quiet evolution. It’s visible. You can’t go back to playing small or staying neutral. The world is responding to the version of you that’s ready to lead differently.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, the focus shifts toward self-worth, money, and values, grounding the intensity of the eclipse into practical reality. This blends with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating your communication and mindset. You’re being asked to take your ideas seriously while still honoring imagination and intuition. The lesson this week is integration. You don’t have to choose between logic and vision. When you trust both, you become a powerful architect of the future you’re here to build.</p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, this week feels like the deep exhale before a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/february-monthly-horoscope-2026-meanings-effects"">brand-new chapter begins</a>. As the week opens with the dark of the moon, you may feel more introspective than usual, pulled toward solitude, memory, and emotional processing. Old fears, habits, or subconscious patterns may surface in these final days of the Year of the Snake, asking for closure. This isn’t about fixing yourself. It’s about forgiveness… of others, of circumstances, and of past versions of you who did the best they could with what they knew.</p>



<p>Everything shifts on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, activating your spiritual, subconscious, and healing realm. This is a powerful internal reset that will unfold quietly but profoundly over the next six months. You may feel called to rest more, create in private, or release attachments that no longer align with your emotional truth. With Uranus squaring the eclipse, sudden realizations or intuitive downloads can arrive unexpectedly. Trust what your inner voice reveals, even if it doesn’t make sense yet.</p>



<p>The tone softens and expands on February 18th as Pisces Season begins, placing the spotlight back on you and your personal journey. This is your time to emerge gently, not rush. It pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, which marks a once-in-a-generation moment of integrating dreams with responsibility. You’re learning that spirituality and structure don’t cancel each other out. They strengthen each other. This week reminds you that your sensitivity is not a liability. It’s the compass guiding you into the next era of your life.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/february-monthly-horoscope-2026-meanings-effects"">Eclipse season is here!</a> The onset of the annual solar and total lunar eclipse is bringing a fateful chance for us to transform. We are shifting our ideas and purpose to find our place in the world. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/yearly-horoscope-2026"">Eclipses help to show us</a> what we need to augment to live a fulfilling existence, and these are no different. The caveat is that we are expected to move forward gracefully, which is hard for anyone, especially since the energy packs a powerful punch that shakes things up unpredictably. Comprehending that some people’s situations and experiences must be shelved or that they must begin a new phase is easier said than done. Compassion for ourselves and others can help us. The only way out is through! See you on the other side!</p>

<h4><strong>The Annular Solar Eclipse In Aquarius</strong></h4>



<p>Take note: February 17th is set to be a momentous day. According to lunar astrology, not only does it usher in the Year of the Fire Horse, but the solar eclipse in Aquarius also occurs at 7:01 a.m. EST. This is the first eclipse that falls on the Aquarius and Leo lunar axis, which makes its formal move into these signs on July 26th. The eclipse activates the coming North Node of Destiny in Aquarius, urging us to usher in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2026-meaning-effects"">a new mindset</a>, and for us all to work cohesively to make global advances. We are a powerful force of nature when we come together.</p>



<p>A “ring of fire” annual solar eclipse is a rare lunar phenomenon that is the result of the moon moving between the sun and earth, while being far from the earth, making the moon look smaller than the sun. The result of the eclipse leaves a fiery look to the circular edges of the moon (in this particular case, the moon will appear that way for two minutes and 20 seconds at the peak of the eclipse). The eclipse is primarily visible from Antarctica. Other regions, such as South America, South Africa, and the Indian Ocean, will have partial views.</p>



<p>The solar eclipse in Aquarius aspects a sensitive point of the sign, known as an anaretic degree (the 29th degree). The urgency to grow and evolve is immediate. It is giving us a chance to embrace our unique sentiments and let them be known. The collective is changing, and we are evolving our minds with it. Because the planet Uranus, which is in Taurus, is active in the eclipse, it’s fair to say that this is the time of revolution. We are going to stand up for what we believe in and won’t back down. The results may be unpredictable at the moment, but the battle is worth fighting for. </p>

<h4>The Total Lunar Eclipse In Virgo</h4>



<p>On March 3rd at 6:38 a.m. EST, the total lunar eclipse in Virgo intensifies the sky, giving stargazers and astrology lovers an amazing sight to see and capture. The lunar eclipse is a time of release, since it connects to the South Node of Destiny in Virgo (on the current Pisces and Virgo lunar axis). We are departing from old views and emotions, making space for us to explore different philosophies. This is a moment of transcendence and reflection, so take a look back at what recently happened that is sparking a reaction that pushes us to run away from it. </p>



<p>During a total lunar eclipse, the moon appears to take on a reddish hue as it passes over the earth’s shadow. Known as the “Blood Moon,” total lunar eclipses are a moment of illumination and revelation. The lunar eclipse will be visible in the Western Americas, Australia, East Asia, and the Pacific Ocean, lasting around 59 minutes at its totality.</p>



<p>The lunar eclipse in Virgo receives a gentle push from Jupiter retrograde in Cancer, making a difference. Jupiter is known to be the planet of luck, but it can also expand matters that are in a delicate position in either good or bad ways. Problems can become bigger; however, Jupiter always ensures that the results are fortunate. The sting may feel intense at the moment, especially since Mercury retrograde in Pisces is causing ambiguity and confusion. Looking back on the eclipse, we’ll realize that letting go of the past was necessary. The moon in Virgo is a creature of comfort, which is why relinquishing control and healing will be challenging. In the end, it’ll be worth the sacrifice and ride.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959267.jpeg?width=756&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=189%3A256"" /></figure></div>



<p>So, I’m <strong><em>that</em></strong> friend. The one <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bucket-list-hotels-r29-editor-picks"">booking her hotel</a> on the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/12/11949132/christmas-travel-where-to-stay-hotel-new-york-city"">flight to the destination.</a> The one who buys her <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capsule-wardrobe-guide-tips"">full wardrobe</a> after getting there. The one with a non-existent itinerary and a deeply held belief that, “If we just walk outside, something will appear.” Some may call it impulsive, but I like to call it spontaneity with a little bit of chaos. </p>



<p>I’ll admit it, I’m a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/life-coach-lessons-type-a-personality"">Type A person’s</a> worst nightmare… and I had every intention of staying that way. That is, until Hilton invited me on a press trip with a handful of seasoned travel reporters, people who don’t just travel, but optimize it. Over dinner, two of them walked me through how they use points to unlock upgrades, experiences, and thousands of dollars in savings I didn’t even realize I was leaving behind.</p>



<p>And for my fellow Type B travelers who’ve been raw-dogging their way through travel, here’s how one Hilton-hosted weekend in West LA reformed me<strong>,</strong> without stripping away my go-with-the-flow energy. </p>



<p>I had just moved from New York to Los Angeles when Hilton reached out to host my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grammy-awards-red-carpet-fashion-2026"">Grammy Awards</a> weekend experience.I jumped at the opportunity to attend music’s biggest night and enjoy a little staycation. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959258.jpg?width=784&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=49%3A64"" /></figure>



<p>What I didn’t expect was horseback riding in Malibu, multi-course dinners on property, and a suite bigger than my NYC <em>and</em> LA apartments combined, all tied to <a href=""https://www.hilton.com/en/hilton-honors/"">Hilton Honors,</a> the brand’s loyalty program that gives members access to curated Grammys weekend packages, upgrades, and experiences I genuinely did not know you could redeem with Points.</p>



<p>And before you roll your eyes at the word “points,” I see you. Because if you’re anything like me, “points” sounds like something that requires 47 international flights and a corporate job with unlimited PTO. I am here to tell you: it’s not as unattainable as it sounds. Let’s break it down. </p>



<p>When you book direct or stay at Hilton properties, you earn points you can actually use, either toward free nights or by combining them with cash. You don’t need some impossible balance, you just use what you have.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959270.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>But what surprised me most is that it’s not just about rooms. Through <a href=""https://experiences.hiltonhonors.com/"">Hilton Honors Experiences</a>, Points can unlock actual moments, concert access, VIP sporting events, spa treatments, even Grammy weekend stays at <a href=""https://www.guestreservations.com/waldorf-astoria-beverly-hills/booking?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=969500850&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=969500850&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADiMQMYLTTERfRqL_lLG1CPWgLJh2&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAtLvMBhB_EiwA1u6_PqKbdLKIq-SYBhQbXWPtEgKHvICNxJYZYDbYnfDvDQqr7PLjdqchMBoCXKAQAvD_BwE"">Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills.</a></p>



<p>And then there are the small things that quietly upgrade your life: skipping the front desk with a digital key, choosing your room in advance, late checkout when you need it. And truuuust me, a girl like me will <em>always</em> need a late checkout. </p>



<p>But what if you’re not headed to the Grammys? What if you just want a moment away from the noise?</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959261.png?width=760&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=95%3A128"" /></figure>



<p>That’s exactly how I ended up on the back of a horse overlooking the Malibu coastline. Hilton partnered with a local outfitter and handled the logistics, transportation, timing, the whole setup, so all I had to do was show up. It’s an experience I would never, ever plan for myself, but it pulled me completely out of my comfort zone in the best way.</p>



<p>We split our stay between <a href=""https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/smoolol-oceana-santa-monica/?WT.mc_id=zLADA0AA1OL2PSH3GGL4AMPHTBRD_Oct5GNPLTPMWBRNLAB6SMOOLOL7EN8i142435__z22150182377z__&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;utm_campaign=%7Bcampaign%7D&amp;utm_adgroup=%7Badgroup%7D&amp;utm_keyword=oceana%20santa%20monica&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22150182377&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA-Q0XEachnVMaiJRrASK4anHY1hat&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAtLvMBhB_EiwA1u6_PsQYcgtXE2HDbyA6H3kXeVE9CLM74zjCDXK21WfEO_2Os5I2H-vsfxoCnpoQAvD_BwE"">Oceana Santa Monica</a> and <a href=""https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/laxwawa-waldorf-astoria-beverly-hills/"">Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills</a>, and they could not have felt more different. The Oceana was rooted in serenity and calm, the type of energy Santa Monica is known for. And if you stay there, head downstairs to the La Monique and grab the Escargot Poppers with garlic herb crème fraîche. Yes, they’re fried snails. And yes, they kind of remind me of mozzarella sticks. Soooo good. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959273.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>On the day of the Grammys, we stayed at the Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills. It felt like a slightly elevated experience and definitely had me feeling like a superstar for the day. The bathroom overlooked the city, the suite was polished and luxurious, and everything about it felt Grammys-coded. When my mom came to visit, we definitely had a pinch me moment. We’re just two girls from the deep-south after all! </p>



<p>All of this to say: points are  for everyone — including you, Type B traveler who still loves chaos but doesn’t mind leveling up. We can still, stubbornly, embrace the chaos while making our money stretch. </p>

<p>There’s a lot to talk about when it comes to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fLCdIYShEQ""><em>Wuthering Heights</em></a><em>. </em>I’m sure we’ll be dissecting and debating it for weeks. From the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wuthering-heights-movie-review-heathcliff-controversy"">whitewashing controversy</a> to the <a href=""https://thenerdsofcolor.org/2026/02/09/noc-review-toxic-love-entices-and-torments-in-wuthering-heights/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">toxic love</a> to the <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/article/an-exclusive-first-look-at-the-wild-and-wonderful-costumes-of-wuthering-heights"">daring costumes</a>, the discourse is going to be <em>discoursing</em>. This film, like most everything Emerald Fennell touches, is going to be divisive. And I think that’s part of its charm and its weakness. As The Ringer put it, <em>Wuthering Heights</em> may be “<a href=""https://www.theringer.com/2026/02/11/movies/wuthering-heights-movie-preview-hate-watch"">the hate-watch event of the year.</a>” Except, I didn’t hate it. </p>



<p>I may be one of the few people that don’t think this Heathcliff should have been anything but the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wuthering-heights-movie-review-heathcliff-controversy"">white fantasy Fennell envisioned</a> (let her make the revitionist movie she wants; we should be championing artists of color to create <em>their</em> wildest desires onscreen and pushing Hollywood execs to greenlight them instead), and this may be strange to admit, considering the movie is based on one of the most toxic relationships in literature, but as soon as Cathy and Heathcliff grew into <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/margot-robbie-jacob-elordi-wuthering-heights"">Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi</a>, and they gave us some of the most blistering and intoxicating chemistry I’ve seen onscreen in awhile, I started to enjoy myself. I couldn’t look away. </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tqqhcoQdeQ"">Emerald Fennell’s <em>Wuthering Heights</em></a><em> </em>is a gothic, depressing tragedy of love, lust, loss, and self destruction and yet, it’s also kind of <em>fun</em> (until it’s not, no spoilers). Aside from the absurdity and campiness of the costumes, one of the things I enjoyed most was how unhinged, horny, and mean Cathy could be. And how weird and complicated <a href=""https://www.countryandtownhouse.com/culture/who-is-alison-oliver/"">Alison Oliver’s Isabella Linton</a> was. As Robbie put it, Cathy is “such a bitch.” You can say a lot about Fennell, but she can write female rage (see: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/12/10238043/promising-young-woman-ending-explainer-cassie-death""><em>Promising Young Woman</em></a>) and here, she sets her sights on female desire. </p>



<p>Late last month, the day after I’d seen <em>Wuthering Heights </em>for the first time, I talked to Robbie and Oliver at the film’s fantastical press junket (it was held at The Doheny Estate at <a href=""https://greystonemansion.org/"">the Greystone Mansion and Gardens</a> and there were<em> Wuthering Heights</em>-themed installations throughout the historic grounds) about their characters’ surprisingly refreshinging agency, that much-discussed <a href=""https://www.vulture.com/article/margot-robbie-jacob-elordi-wuthering-heights-press-tour-weird.html"">Robbie-Elordi chemistry</a>, and which costumes shocked them the most.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959156.jpeg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p><strong>Both of these characters are messy. They’re destructive. They’re unapologetic. They put female desire first, which I think is going to piss some people off, but I loved that about them. It would be easy to say that their entire identities are wrapped up in romantic obsession. But talk about how important it was to show that female desire, that all consuming desire, and the choices that these women make for themselves? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Margot Robbie: </strong>Do you know what felt radical? We have a scene — Alison and I — on the swing in the garden, and it’s a scene essentially, where we’re just fight over Heathcliff, and it felt so radical to do a scene like that. The ironic thing is that we’ve fought so hard to not have to do that in movies anymore, but now it’s been so long since — I don’t know if I’ve done a scene like this since I was on the soap opera I was on back in Australia when I was a teenager. It felt so radical to just be two women fighting over a man. It was crazy. “You have him. He’s so handsome. Who you talking about? You could never take him!” It was weirdly exciting to do.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> It felt so radical to just be two women fighting over a man… It was weirdly exciting to do.</p><cite>margot robbie on cathy and isabella</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>Alison Oliver: </strong>Yeah, it was strange. All of these characters do have — I feel like Emerald really gave them agency in their own ways as well, which within the sort of confines or the period, you do feel like they have agency in some sense. And I think that was important to show. </p>



<p><strong>Absolutely. They have depth and agency.</strong></p>



<p><strong>MR: </strong>Yeah, they all make the choices. And then everything you see in the movie happens because of the choices they make. Whereas usually, even now, when we’re not doing scenes fighting about men, most of the time, you’re usually playing a character that something happens to, and then you watch a movie about the effects of that thing happening to that female character. </p>



<p><strong>AO:</strong> They are the decider.</p>

<p><strong>MR: </strong>For both of our characters, I feel like we make a choice, we do a thing, and it’s not the right thing in most instances, and then we have to deal with the consequences.</p>



<p><strong>OK, Margot, this does not work unless you and Jacob have the most insane chemistry we’ve ever seen on screen. And you did. I’m always fighting to bring back chemistry, and you guys did it. </strong></p>



<p><strong>MR: </strong>Yes! Chemistry and charisma are two things that I’m like, why can’t we have that? That’s what I want in the movies. Charismatic characters or I want insane chemistry,</p>



<p><strong>Was there a moment where you and Jacob were like, <em>Oh, we got it</em></strong>?</p>



<p><strong>MR: </strong>There were a couple of moments. Even on day one. [We shot] the first scene in the movie where Cathy flings open the bed hangings, and [Heathcliff is] lying in bed. And then we ended up cutting this bit but I walked up over him, and then crouch down and got like <em>this</em> close to his face and told him to, “get up, we’ve got neighbors,” or whatever it was. And we cut that bit because the proximity is something we wanted to save. But, I mean, that was day one, and even then, everyone was kind of like, “Whoa.” And we were like, “Okay, I think this movie’s gonna work.” Also just because she’s throwing something at him, and he’s throwing it back, and he’s like, “What?” There was already an intensity between them that I think we could build on from that point. </p>



<p><strong>Alison, what was it like watching Margot and Jacob build that chemistry? </strong></p>



<p><strong>AO: </strong>Incredible. I kept feeling like I was watching, like an old Hollywood film, like watching Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift. It really was so incredible to see the two of them just inhabit those characters. It was really special.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959160.jpeg?width=1024&amp;height=561&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A561"" /></figure>



<p><strong>We have to talk about the costumes. There were so many moments in my theater that the whole audience gasped at certain costumes. Were there any moments for both of you that you saw a costume you put on and it shocked you? </strong></p>



<p><strong>AO: </strong>We had so many costume changes. Every time, in me and Margot’s rooms — we were next to each other and they put us both in our rooms — it would probably take like, half an hour to get into the outfit, and then we’d both come out of the room at the same time and do a reveal. I never felt like more of a girl in my life. I’d come out and be like, <em>Ah!!</em> [mimics screaming]!! </p>



<p><strong>MR: </strong>You couldn’t control that reaction if you wanted to. And I didn’t want to, but I couldn’t even if I had wanted to. It was so fun.</p>



<p><strong>AO: </strong>[to Margot] Did you have a favorite? </p>



<p><strong>MR:</strong> I think my favorite was on the swing. That costume during the swing scene [was my favorite]. It’s got this black velvet bodice, and this like and this like neck thing, and then this bit’s showing, but then it’s like, got this chainwork in pink rose. We replicated these old couple of paintings of women in that outfit. One woman wore it, got painted in it, and then someone else was like, <em>Well, I want that.</em> And then did it as well. I think there’s three different decades apart where they’ve done this. I was like, <em>wow, that lady was the original Kardashian</em>. Like, did she wear something and everyone was like, “I want to wear what she wore!” </p>

<p><strong>AO: </strong>There’s this shot where Margot is on the swing, and then I think Isabella says something, and [Cathy] twists around. And every time [she] did that, I literally was like, “that’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.” And I would break  character and be like [<em>gasps</em>].</p>



<p><strong>I remember that scene. It’s also a bitchy moment.</strong></p>



<p><strong>MR: </strong>She’s such a bitch, and then swings back around<em> [laughs].</em></p>

<p>When <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/10/11939743/the-pitt-season-2-characters-storyline-release-date"">The Pitt’s</a></em> <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/shabanaazeez_/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shabana Azeez</a> talks about her <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/changing-surname-career-ethnic-discrimination"">career,</a> she traces it back to a single, almost accidental moment of kindness that allowed her to follow a dream that had always been inside her. “I got into acting because a lady was really nice to me one time,” she says, laughing. It sounds flippant, but it’s the truth. She grew up in a family where the arts were not encouraged, academics were the priority, and despite wanting to act her whole life, she never studied drama at school. It wasn’t until she was working at Mercury CX, an emerging filmmakers’ hub in Adelaide, Australia, that someone finally asked her the right question.</p>



<p>Her boss pulled her aside. “She said, ‘You’re great, but this isn’t your passion. What is it?’ And I was like, ‘Well, I’d like to act, but I’ve literally never acted before.'” Within an hour, her boss had secured her an audition for a short film, and she booked it, with no prior acting experience. That led her to secure roles in the animated <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/gemma-chua-tran-lesbian-space-princess-queer"">Lesbian Space Princess</a></em> and the coercive-control thriller <em>Bird Eater</em>. She expresses the same mix of gratitude as she talks about her leap from Australian indie television to <a href=""https://www.hbomax.com/shows/pitt-2024/e6e7bad9-d48d-4434-b334-7c651ffc4bdf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">HBO’s </a><em><a href=""https://www.hbomax.com/shows/pitt-2024/e6e7bad9-d48d-4434-b334-7c651ffc4bdf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Pitt</a></em><a href=""https://www.hbomax.com/shows/pitt-2024/e6e7bad9-d48d-4434-b334-7c651ffc4bdf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">.</a> The contrast, she says, is both extreme and strangely familiar. “It’s chalk and cheese in some ways, and exactly the same in others,” she explains. The budgets are bigger, the access is better, on <em>The Pitt</em>, she can consult real doctors and benefit from an army of specialists, but the core remains unchanged. “Everyone cares about the story.”</p>



<p>When Shabana first read the script for<em> The Pitt </em>she described it as information overload. “It’s like ten series regulars and then a bunch of recurring characters, and then all the patients, and all the names for the doctors are surnames. So you can’t be like, ‘Who’s a woman? Who’s a man? What are their age?’ There’s no clues. I had to go out and buy more highlighters and color-code the entire script,” she says. The audition process for <em>The Pitt </em>was surprisingly lowkey: a single self-tape, followed by a Zoom scheduled for twenty minutes that wrapped after just nine minutes. When the call ended early, she assumed it was a bad sign. “I cried for half an hour afterwards,” she says. “The Zoom was nine minutes. The emotional recovery was three times that.” So when she landed the role, and learned the production would sponsor her visa and fly her halfway across the world it came as a genuine shock.</p>



<p>Moving to LA was, in her words, “horrible in so many ways” and yet also strangely exhilarating. There was a joy in not knowing what came next, in stepping into something undefined. “To not know what you’re stepping into, and to have that curiosity, that scared feeling, that’s what life is about,” she says. Once in Los Angeles, the emotional weight of the move fully settled in. “Oh my god, I knew no one,” she says. “I truly knew not a single person in LA.” That isolation became especially clear during her first days at work. Sitting at lunch during boot camp, she watched as coworkers casually texted friends and loved ones. “Everybody was texting their friends, and I was like, I have no friends to text. They’re all asleep,” she says. “That was really lonely and really scary,” she adds.</p>



<p>Everything shifted when she formed a close friendship with co-star Supriya Ganesh, who plays Dr Samira Mohan. Their bond deepened quickly. “I adore her. I think the world of her,” she says simply. “She’s my best friend.” That sense of shared experience extended into their professional lives as well. Shabana notes that her character wasn’t originally written to be South Asian, but the production pivoted after her audition. “I remember thinking that would never happen because they already had a ‘brown girl’,” she says, pointing to the unspoken limits that still shape representation on screen. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“All of our experiences in the world are embodied experiences, and mine is that of a young brown woman, and that’s not going to change. It was so healing to have somebody there with me.”</p><cite>Shabana azeez</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Season one was filmed in near-total anonymity. By season two, the shift was impossible to ignore. Filming now overlapped with awards season; days were spent on set, nights at the Golden Globes or Critics’ Choice Awards. The pace was punishing. “I got flu-level sick three times,” she admits. Still, amid the noise and spectacle, the work itself never changed. “The show is the same to make,” she says. “And that’s really grounding.” In <em>The Pitt</em>, Shabana plays Victoria, a medical student, a role that could easily collapse into the familiar model minority archetype: hyper-competent, genius-level, and primarily functional. But Shabana was intent on resisting that flattening, shaping Victoria into a character defined as much by her flaws as her intelligence. “When we talk about excellence or prodigies, we tend to think, ‘Let’s play that,’” she says. “But that’s not really how people work. When you’re very good at something, you usually have a deficit that’s just as powerful. For Victoria, it’s social. She’s deeply socially inept.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958220.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>What she loves most about acting is the research. “It’s an exercise in empathy,” she says. Through projects like <em>Bird Eater</em>, where she researched stories of emotional abuse, she found it changed her not only as an actor, but as a person. “Every woman I spoke to had a story. It genuinely changed my life.” Rather than focusing solely on the medical aspects of her role, she immersed herself in romance novels, glossy American teen dramas, and studies of loneliness. Victoria, she explains, is “building a life she doesn’t really want,” and fantasy becomes a form of escape. By Season Two, the show allows that internal tension to surface. “We really dig into the icky parts, her jealousy, her exhaustion, her sharpness. She fails a lot. And I think that’s what actually dismantles the model minority myth.”</p>



<p>When I asked Shabana how she stays grounded amid the whirlwind success of <em>The Pitt</em>, she laughs. “My little brother keeps me really grounded. Honestly, they kind of bully me about it, which is actually kind of helpful. When I went home for Christmas, every time I tried to speak and someone interrupted me, my brother would be like, ‘Everybody, excuse me — Hollywood is trying to speak.’ Before I said anything, my uncle would be like, ‘Action.’ It’s that kind of teasing that reminds me it’s just a job.”</p>



<p>“It brings me back to earth. It’s meaningful work, but it’s art, it’s play, and it’s fun, it’s not brain surgery. I think there’s a real danger of people taking themselves too seriously, and my family bullying me actually really helps with that.”<br /><br /><strong><em>Season 2 of The Pitt is now streaming on HBO MAX . </em></strong></p>
