<p>Located not far from Garosu-gil, ""Triplet Code, Sinsa"" is positioned directly facing a small neighborhood park with greenery at the very end of Serosu-gil. The site faces the park, has an elementary school right next to it, and is surrounded by neighborhood shops that extend from Garosu-gil, gradually activating even the back alleys. According to Clarence Perry's Neighborhood Unit theory, the three core elements that promote physical convenience and pleasant living for residents — an elementary school, neighborhood shops, and a small park — are all present in the vicinity, so at first glance, it might seem that the conditions for residents are perfectly met. However, the recent excessive expansion of nearby commercial facilities is likely making the residential environment feel far from comfortable for existing residents. In fact, as Garosu-gil became more trendy and commercialized, gentrification reaching this area had already been anticipated for some time.</p>",

There were overlapping uses, unclear passages, and timid natural light that entered, unable to structure daily life. <strong>Our starting point was to restore logic and meaning to the whole, transforming two disconnected halves into a single organism.</strong></p>",

But don’t confuse this agility with a lack of strength, focus, or clear objectives; true growth demands disciplined alignment to build lasting foundations.</em></p><p>This article is suited for UX growth-focused professional, product people, or startups that speak the language of business, tying insights to money, time, or risk.</p><p>As a User experience growth focused, my design process is governed by a series of questions:</p><p>“Have I defined the right problem?”</p><p>“Am I getting clear insights, or is there bias?”</p><p>“How might I solve it?”</p><p>“Is this the best solution?”</p><p>“How does it work?”</p><p>“What should I measure?”</p><p>“What risks might it create? How’s the future stage or future enhancement?”</p><p>“Does it impact both the business and the users positively?”</p><p>This mindset isn’t just good UX, it’s the bedrock of sustainable growth. Too often, companies chase growth at all costs, only to discover their foundation is crumbling. They scale a product people don’t love, solve problems users don’t have, and burn resources on ineffective experiments.</p><p>Let’s take a look at Workday, it’s a powerful HR and finance platform often criticized for its frustrating user experience, especially in the job application process. You guys, who’s ever tried Workday? We might know this isn’t an isolated issue. The Baymard Institute found that nearly 70% of online shopping carts are abandoned, largely due to poor UX.</p><p>This is the exact problem Product-Led Growth (PLG) aims to solve. In simple terms, PLG means your product itself becomes the primary engine for user acquisition, conversion, and retention. It’s a philosophy that forces design, marketing, sales, and engineering to align around the user experience. Often, this activity proceeds by a growth team who orchestrates but the skeleton is strategy + user experience.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6tb4w2wxyLCitsGdRh_0Dw.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://share.google/7WzjN5Ur51rKjUsEm""><em>The Product-Led Prism</em></a><em> by </em>www.productled.org</figcaption></figure><p>But there’s a catch.</p><h4><strong>The Foundation: Product-Market Fit</strong></h4><p>A business can only focus on true, scalable growth after achieving product-market fit.

Scaling beforehand is like building a skyscraper on sand.</p><h4><strong>The Pitfall: Confusing Speed with Strength</strong></h4><p>The pressure to grow fast, especially in early-stage startups, can be deafening. But speed without direction leads to failure.</p><p>An experienced business strategist, Yulia Neicovcean, illustrates two scenarios:</p><blockquote>“…</blockquote><blockquote>Scenario 1: Growth That Lasts</blockquote><blockquote>Companies decided early to build structure solid CRM, client retention strategies, and a focus on prime communities. They didn’t try to do everything. They specialized. As the market shifted, their brand held strong, and they kept growing steadily instead of burning out.</blockquote><blockquote>Scenario 2: Failure in Fast-Forward</blockquote><blockquote>Another company scaled aggressively hiring quickly, chasing every new trend, ignoring compliance and fundamentals. For a year it looked like they were unstoppable. But when regulations tightened and clients demanded quality over quantity, the cracks showed. Within two years, they went from “the next big thing” to closing their doors.</blockquote><blockquote>The lesson is clear:</blockquote><blockquote>Growth is not proof of success; sustainability is. “</blockquote><p>This is where two powerful frameworks come together to create a solution.</p><p><strong>1. McKinsey’s Three Horizons of Growth: The Strategic Compass</strong></p><p>The McKinsey Three Horizons model first introduced in The Alchemy of Growth (1999) remains a valuable tool for prioritizing innovation. However, its traditional interpretation has a critical blind spot in the digital age.</p><p>The original model suggests that disruptive innovations (Horizon 3) emerge from long research and development cycles. While this is still true for fields like biotech or energy, the modern trap is failing to recognize that today’s most powerful disruptions often skip this lengthy phase.</p><p>Instead, they are achieved by repurposing existing, mature technologies — like cloud computing, APIs, and mobile platforms — into radical new business models. This is where strategy and user experience intersect:</p><ul><li><strong>Disruption Lies in Business Model &amp; UX: </strong>Companies like Uber, Airbnb, and Instagram didn’t invent new core technologies (GPS, online payments, photo-sharing). They leveraged existing ones to create a fundamentally superior and seamless user experience, which in turn defined a new business model.</li><li><strong>Speed as a Disruptive Force: </strong>The ability to rapidly deploy these experience-driven models creates a powerful advantage. A competitor stuck in the old Horizon 3 mindset is still in R&amp;D, while a UX-focused competitor has already captured the market.</li></ul><p>Therefore, the framework is still useful for categorizing ambitions, but its value for planning disruption is limited. Its full potential is only unlocked when integrated with a deep understanding of how existing technology can be reimagined through user-centric design to create immediate, market-changing value.</p><p><strong>The model guides you to balance your focus across three time horizons:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Horizon 1 (H1): Your Core Business. </strong>This is what pays the bills today. Initiatives here focus on optimizing, defending, and growing your existing operations (e.g., improving checkout conversion rates).</li><li><strong>Horizon 2 (H2): Emerging Opportunities. </strong>These are new ventures that are expected to become your core business in the next 1–3 years (e.g., launching a new product line or entering a new market).</li><li><strong>Horizon 3 (H3): Future Bets. </strong>These are long-term ideas and experiments that could define your future (e.g., R&amp;D for a disruptive technology).</li></ul><p>The failed company in Scenario 2 was likely chasing H3 dreams without a profitable H1 foundation. A sustainable strategy requires actively managing all three.</p><p><strong>2. UXR as a Product Discovery Mindset: The Reality Check</strong></p><p>As Marty Cagan notes in his book INSPIRED, “<em>The few that succeed are usually those that are really good at the product discovery phase</em>.” This is where User Experience Research (UXR) evolves from a mere task into a core mindset.</p><p>It’s the continuous practice of asking:</p><ul><li>“Are we solving the right problem?”</li><li>“Will users actually use this?”</li><li>“Can we build a viable business around it?”</li></ul><p>This UXR mindset is the solution to the “Three Horizons trap.” It replaces long, risky R&amp;D cycles in H3 with a culture of continuous learning, ensuring strategy is guided by evidence from the very beginning.</p><p>This isn’t about occasional testing, it’s about rapidly identifying hidden opportunities to repurpose our existing technologies to solve real user problems with the right analysis. This approach enables the fast, asymmetric disruptions that define modern, sustainable growth.</p><p>This is why I created the Sustainable Growth Flowchart. It’s a practical map that combines these two frameworks, ensuring every growth initiative is grounded in both strategic business planning and user reality.</p><h3><strong>The Sustainable Growth Flowchart: </strong>The Intersection of Business Strategy and User Experience</h3><p>For downloadable file: <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W4pklZ8LLiq68oFk2M32W3cekI-YxhgN/view?usp=drive_link"">check here</a></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Wy-LruGuoDkG0x0dZt4f5Q.png"" /><figcaption>The Intersection of Business Strategy and User Experience — By Lismayasari Annisyah</figcaption></figure><p>Let’s walk through the key decision gates. The entire process is a cycle, governed by ‘Monitor, Measure, and Adapt.’</p><ol><li>Begin with a Ruthless Audit: Defining the Right Problem</li></ol><p>The flowchart starts here because launching into solutions without validating the core problem is a fundamental failure mode in UX and product design. This step embodies a user research (UXR) mindset, systematically deconstructing assumptions through methods such as analytics review, user interviews, surveys, competitive analysis, or journey mapping. The term “ruthless” signifies a commitment to brutal honesty and a willingness to kill ideas if data reveals they are misaligned or ineffective. This audit is not a one-time event; it’s a process for uncovering latent opportunities, such as unmet user needs that could drive retention or acquisition.</p><p>I watched Melanie Perkins, Co-founder and CEO of Canva, explain in Founder Story interviews that their core mission was to “democratize design” making design accessible to non-designers rather than simply adding features to complex tools. Through user research and analytics, they refined the problem statement, which led to a simplified interface and increased adoption among users who were not design experts.</p><p>As I’m in a SaaS product, this might involve auditing my onboarding flow. If drop-off rates are high, user interviews could uncover confusing UX patterns, prompting a redesign that aligns with users’ mental models. Incorporating tools like heatmaps (e.g., Hotjar) is one of many methods that can be used to help identify cognitive biases in our assumptions, ensuring the problem is validated by users (the right problem), not ego-driven.</p><p>2. The First Critical Gate: Product-Market Fit (PMF)</p><p>This is the flowchart’s decisive checkpoint: “Have we achieved Product-Market Fit?” If not, the directive is to return to research; scaling is not permitted. PMF means your product solves a real problem for a well-defined market so effectively that users become habitual adopters. UXR verifies this by connecting to problem/solution fit, GAP analysis, value proposition clarity, Bayesian analysis, or mixed-method research. Also, see metrics like retention, churn rates, or any metrics that fit our business type. Bypassing this gate means investing resources into what the flowchart calls a “broken engine.”</p><p>I read ‘The Slack Origin Story’ by Techcrunch, they explained that Slack serves as a classic example, as it pivoted from a gaming tool to a team communication platform after internal data showed skyrocketing adoption within their own team. Early PMF was validated through strong engagement metrics and user feedback, which justified scaling efforts. Regarding this, UX people can conduct cohort analysis, if users return daily and refer others, you likely have PMF.</p><p>If not, iterate on core features using qualitative insights, bayesian analysis, the buyer’s/user journey, or any method that can map the system.</p><p>We maybe familiar with Airbnb, they achieved PMF by focusing on high-quality photos and trust-building UX elements, converting skeptical users into advocates. This gate prevents startups from burning capital on unvalidated ideas, reinforcing user experience as the foundation of market resonance.</p><p>3. Set Goals and Select Your Lever: Balancing Growth Strategies</p><p>Once PMF is confirmed, the flowchart directs you to establish measurable goals such as KPIs for user acquisition or churn reduction and choose appropriate growth levers. This draws on the Ansoff Matrix: Market Penetration (deepening engagement within existing markets), Product Development (building new features for current users), Market Development (bringing existing products to new markets), or Diversification (launching new products in new markets). It’s critical to align these with strategic time horizons: H1 (short-term optimization), H2 (medium-term expansion), and H3 (long-term innovation) ensuring sustainability without overextending resources. This means UX practitioners can recommend a lever prioritize that enhance user delight, while the company sets up strategic resource allocation.</p><p>Spotify as our favorite music player, for instance, they employed Product Development (H2) by introducing personalized playlists, which increased retention among existing users, while also pursuing Market Penetration (H1) through free-tier offerings in new regions.</p><p>For example, if we have a goal to double user growth, we might choose Market Penetration via UX improvements like a seamless referral program while investing in H3 diversification such as AI-powered features.</p><p>Quartr.com explained that Netflix successfully diversified into original content (H3) after saturating its core streaming market, using data to guide decisions. This balanced approach avoids the “growth at all costs” trap, ensuring UX drives long-term value.</p><p>4. The Alignment Check: The PLG Litmus Test</p><p>Before execution, the flowchart mandates asking: “Are cross-functional teams aligned and adequately funded?” This step operationalizes Product-Led Growth (PLG), where the product itself through intuitive UX drives acquisition, conversion, and expansion, reducing reliance on heavy sales tactics. If marketing, design, engineering, or other teams are not synchronized, the process loops back. This prevents siloed efforts that undermine initiatives. Designers need this alignment to ensure UX remains central. Also, it means funding experiments with clear ownership.</p><p>Ruben Dominguez wrote about The Rise of PLG, explaining that Dropbox mastered PLG by making file-sharing so effortless that users naturally invited others, with cross-functional teams iterating based on evidance and the right problem. Let’s check our business, If your PLG test fails, evidenced by a low viral coefficient, it may stem from misalignment. For example, researcher deliver insights and recommendations about, but marketing have different definition about the findings. Also, design may advocate for user testing, but engineering lacks the resources to implement changes.</p><p>Grammarly is another example: cross-functional alignment around a freemium UX model fueled viral growth without significant marketing spend. This can be initiated by the product, research, or growth department. This check is especially critical in startups, where limited budgets amplify the cost of misalignment.</p><p>The entire process is cyclical, governed by ‘Monitor, Measure, and Adapt, and back to monitor because sustainable growth is never a one-and-done effort.”</p><p>The entire process is cyclical, governed by ‘Monitor, Measure, and Adapt, and back to monitor because sustainable growth is never a one-and-done effort.”</p><h4><strong>As it’s never a one-and-done effort, what’s the truth about business growth?</strong></h4><p>Scaling a business and achieving exponential growth isn’t something impossible. Even though it’s difficult, it can be achieved when a business truly has the right strategy, the right execution, and the right focus.</p><p>It’s also important to understand what actually slows down business growth whether it’s the team, the system, the strategy, or even the mindset and inaccurate knowledge that shape every decision.</p><p>Oh, I know. It’s so easy to say things like, “Just check your business issues, solve them, and you’ll have sustainable growth!”</p><p>Sometimes you already have high-quality services, a brilliant system, and strategic marketing but the real issue is in our mindset or even our immaturity.</p><p>But the good news is: we can always learn, unlearn, and relearn anything.</p><h4><strong>Key reminders for designer growth focused</strong></h4><p>What I’ve learned from my own reflections and insights from product leaders:</p><p>1. Set clear goals; for the day, the week, the month, and the year.</p><p>2. Investigate deeply; look for real opportunities and make sure you’re solving the right problem.</p><p>3. Experiment and iterate; explore concepts with scalability potential or take calculated risks.</p><ul><li>Apply the right product design principles</li><li>Use the right UI patterns and UX laws that work</li><li>Read and interpret data clearly</li><li>Choose effective methods and define the right metrics</li></ul><p>4. Be aware of design responsibility; always consider the impact on both users and the business. Ethics matter.</p><p>Sustainable growth demands both strategic discipline and user-centered insight. Speed alone is not strength. Strength comes from clarity, reflection, and responsible execution.</p><p>My flowchart is not a final answer, but a guide a tool for reflection and decision-making. It exists to replace guesswork with a disciplined, evidence-driven system.</p><p>Now, ask yourself:</p><p>Where does your product currently stand?

<h3><strong>Are you designing for the user’s values — or your own?</strong></h3><h4>The future of design will be the negotiation between multiple moral worlds.</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*rAPqyo-0EgOK8hmB"" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=""https://unsplash.com/@vincefleming?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Vince Fleming</a> on <a href=""https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>It’s not a stretch to suggest that as technology becomes more omnipresent, the designer’s role will shift from “hands-on” making to shaping how humanity interacts with machines. We will evolve from designing screens to defining moral guardrails. And like any profession with the power to influence lives — doctors, lawyers, policymakers — designers will need a strong foundation in ethics.</p><p>This is the core reason I developed the<a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html""> Five Pillars of Ethical Interface Design</a> — an evolving framework I actively invite other designers to engage with and offer feedback on. The pillars are meant to push designers to confront the moral weight of their decisions rather than hide behind aesthetics, heuristics, or empathy theater.</p><p>The truth is designers rarely operate from a neutral position. Even when they insist they’re “designing for the user,” their own <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/230538.230561"">assumptions, values, and biases</a> inevitably slip into the work — usually without them noticing.</p><p>This is mainly due to what can be described as ethical misalignment — the gap between the user values designers think they’re honoring and the internal values that actually shape their decisions.</p><p>One of the main drivers of this misalignment is the industry’s habit of treating empathy as a stand-in for values — and sometimes as permission to slip personal priorities into the work.</p><p>Designers start assuming that a superficial understanding what someone experiences automatically tells them what should matter. It’s a comforting belief. It’s also wrong.</p><p>As <a href=""https://medium.com/thinking-design/why-i-dont-believe-in-empathic-design-c3dd0a956de9"">Don Norman has argued</a>, designers can’t actually have empathy in any literal sense — we can only observe behavior and imagine internal states. And imagination is unreliable.</p><p>The worst example of this is applying empathy before actual research occurs—projection masquerading as insight. We all do this, and it feels like basic human decency, but it can be dangerous to assume you know what another individual experiences or what their values actually are.</p><p>Empathy clarifies what a user experiences, but it does not tell you which experience should matter more. It doesn’t decide which trade-offs are acceptable, or how to weigh one user’s needs against another’s. Those choices come from values, not empathy.</p><p>Part of the problem is that traditional UX methods don’t actually measure user values. They measure usability, preferences, and observable behavior — but none of that tells you how a person morally prioritizes inclusion, autonomy, privacy, transparency, or well-being.</p><p>Because those deeper values remain invisible, designers end up filling the gaps with their own assumptions. That’s how teams convince themselves they’re “designing for the user” when the product is quietly reflecting the team’s values instead of the user’s.</p><h4><strong>How designer values sneak into the interface</strong></h4><p>It shouldn’t be surprising that everyone’s moral compass points in different directions. Flip between Fox and CNN for thirty seconds and you’ll see two completely different worldviews presented as fact.</p><p>Just as news outlets present competing realities, <a href=""https://monoskop.org/images/8/8c/Winner_Langdon_1980_Do_Artifacts_Have_Politics.pdf"">designers construct realities too</a> — every interface carries an implicit stance about what should matter. For example, when <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html#inclusion"">inclusion</a> rises to the top of a designer’s priorities, the user experience naturally becomes more nuanced. Accommodating a wider range of needs often softens the straightforward simplicity a majority audience might expect.</p><p>If <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html#wellbeing"">well-being</a> dominates, the pattern shifts again. Efficient or engaging features get softened or buried to reduce compulsion. That may feel responsible inside the team, but it frustrates users who value speed, momentum, or freedom.</p><p>And if <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html#transparency"">transparency</a> is the user’s priority, the need for disclosure might be ignored in the name of a clean, frictionless flow. Teams hide or compress information instead of presenting it fully. It satisfies an internal bias for elegance, but it leaves users with less clarity and less agency.</p><p>These types of choices rarely come directly from user research. They come from the ethics of the team itself — values that quietly harden into the architecture of the product.</p><h4>Why explicit ethical structures matter</h4><p>Ethical value tensions show up in nearly every product decision, yet the industry still struggles to confront them explicitly. <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/242485.242493"">Batya Friedman’s <em>Value Sensitive Design</em></a> (VSD), developed decades ago, was one of the first efforts to systematize this concept. It provided a structured way to examine which human values ought to guide technology — from the conceptual level to empirical research to technical implementation.</p><p>However, VSD has not gained widespread adoption in industry, largely because it leans toward an academic framework rather than a practical tool designers can apply to everyday product decisions. It’s also worth noting that any system attempting to prescribe a moral framework ignores the ethical dilemma <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem"">David Hume identified—you cannot derive an <em>ought</em> from an <em>is</em></a>.</p><p><a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html"">My framework</a> ties to avoid that trap. Instead of prescribing specific moral priorities, it exposes the gap between the values teams believe they’re honoring and the values users actually experience once those values are expressed in the interface. It’s not about telling designers which values to adopt — it’s about making the value tensions visible so trade-offs are conscious rather than accidental.</p><p>But before we can make ethical decisions, we need to understand the user’s values with precision. That’s why I’ve started to develop a simple Ethical Interface Design evaluation tool to sit alongside the Five Pillars of Ethical Interface Design framework.</p><p>The tool uses a <a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Uj4fi7SP9sUYVu2qbgeW0Tvy2hPAGeg9C1t00D57DrI/preview"">short 10-question survey</a>. For each of the <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html"">five pillars</a> (inclusion, autonomy, transparency, privacy, and well-being), users answer two prompts: one that captures their ethical preference — how important that pillar is to them — and another that evaluates how well the product currently delivers on that value, each rated from 1 to 5.</p><p>Together, the five pillars and the evaluation tool are not about prescribing which values you should hold. They expose the gap between what users actually prefer and the moral defaults the product is quietly imposing. The math is simple:</p><p><strong>User preference (1–5) minus Product score (1–5) = Gap.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>0</strong> → aligned</li><li><strong>Negative</strong> → you’re not meeting the value the user actually wants</li><li><strong>Positive</strong> → you’re pushing a value harder than the user prefers</li></ul><p>The key to making <a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Uj4fi7SP9sUYVu2qbgeW0Tvy2hPAGeg9C1t00D57DrI/preview"">this survey</a> work is to implement questions that expose ethical design tradeoffs. For example, if we look at the <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html#transparency"">pillar of transparency</a> (note: these questions are still being refined):</p><figure><img alt=""Survey with two questions: one about preference for speed vs. explanations, the other about clarity of product explanations. Each has five radio button options."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/645/1*pKf-yFEXGBVfbFlTUOTbMg.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot from Ethical Interface Design Evaluation</figcaption></figure><p>Across a group of users, the patterns show you exactly where your design values match the audience — and where your own worldview is leaking into the interface.</p><h4>The ethical pivot point</h4><p>Technology is no longer just entertainment, utilities, or conveniences.<br />It mediates attention, communication, decisions, even identity. That makes every value baked into an interface more consequential. We’re not arranging screens anymore. We’re shaping the logic of human–machine interaction — and by extension, shaping behavior and culture.</p><p>By understanding user values through <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/index.html"">ethical design</a> frameworks and tools we can help designers see where their instincts, assumptions, and moral defaults are quietly overriding the people they’re designing for. Not to eliminate value tension — that’s impossible — but to recognize it and make trade-offs consciously instead of unconsciously.</p><p>Ethical design isn’t about being virtuous. It’s about being honest with yourself about the values you’re imposing.</p><p>And in the end, it comes down to one unavoidable question: <strong>Are you designing for the user’s values — or your own?</strong></p><h4><em>References</em></h4><ul><li>Bias in computer systems: <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/230538.230561"">https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/230538.230561</a></li><li>Why I Don’t Believe in Empathic Design: <a href=""https://medium.com/thinking-design/why-i-dont-believe-in-empathic-design-c3dd0a956de9"">https://medium.com/thinking-design/why-i-dont-believe-in-empathic-design-c3dd0a956de9</a></li><li>Value-Sensitive Design: <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/242485.242493"">https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/242485.242493</a></li><li>Do Artifacts Have Politics?: <a href=""https://monoskop.org/images/8/8c/Winner_Langdon_1980_Do_Artifacts_Have_Politics.pdf"">https://monoskop.org/images/8/8c/Winner_Langdon_1980_Do_Artifacts_Have_Politics.pdf</a></li></ul><p><strong><em>Don’t miss out! </em></strong><a href=""https://micbuckcreative.medium.com/subscribe""><strong><em>Join my email list</em></strong></a><strong><em> and receive the latest content.</em></strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=11ee5268dff2"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/are-you-designing-for-the-users-values-or-your-own-11ee5268dff2"">Are you designing for the user’s values — or your own?</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

It’s incredible to me, as both a university instructor and a UX designer, that the army of people working at OpenAI are not imagining better tools for our students. I want to walk you through a design pattern in ChatGPT that, despite its good intentions, might be creating unintended hurdles for students.</p><p>I’m talking about “<a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07858v1"">verbosity compensation</a>”, which is an LLM’s tendency to provide overly wordy answers.</p><p>We’ve all seen it. You ask for help, and the AI provides a dense, multi-part response, that sounds like high-quality until you look closer. The challenge for learning specifically, is that managing the learner’s cognitive load is critical, and presenting information this way can be overwhelming. It’s a bit like asking how to boil an egg and getting the entire science of how water boils, the protein structure of an egg, and two egg salad recipes in response.</p><p>Let’s dive into ChatGPT’s “Study and Learn” mode with both our cognitive science and UX design lenses. I originally did this breakdown in a <a href=""https://youtu.be/QDCk3UWzg0U"">YouTube video</a>, and I’ve adapted it into an article here so it can be accessible to more folks. By the end of the article, I’ll explore potential interface ideas that could help with learning.</p><h3>All the steps at once</h3><p>To start, I used a simple, real-world prompt from a student: “I want to learn about Montreal’s role in the fur trade in shaping Canada’s history for an essay.”</p><p>You can see in the response below how heavy the answer is compared to the request. Yes, the student didn’t do a good job being specific, but as non-experts we should expect that they won’t always know.</p><figure><img alt=""A ChatGPT response with many bullets and follow-up recommendations"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*g46CoGaiV6Ziwd9D"" /></figure><p>When I broke down the response, I saw it was trying to do four things at once: ask the students’ grade, provide facts, suggest an essay structure, and ask if the student wanted to continue.</p><p>However not all of these are immediately appropriate when a student comes in with an uncertain request. To make this easier to follow, let’s give each part of the answer a name so we can analyze them more closely:</p><ol><li>Requirements gathering</li><li>Additional context</li><li>Structure recommendation</li><li>Task confirmation</li></ol><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*8zQeQqSagGlyZqvL"" /></figure><p>Now as UX designers, you know how important it is to structure steps to avoid overwhelming the users. It’s the reason why wizards and screen-by-screen flows are used in any task that requires multiple levels of user reflection, input, and confirmation.</p><p>Below I highlighted how each of these four steps has different expectations from the user, from needing user input to simply informing them.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YHUr9-2N_QeiwTKufdrq8Q.png"" /></figure><p>Let’s compare the ChatGPT response, with an Amazon checkout flow to highlight this gap. Looking at the screens below, notice how each step has a discrete action requested from the customer, and <em>just enough</em> information for the customer to make an informed decision.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*S51LfN5lx688hmPu"" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=""https://www.shaheermalik.com/blog/amazon-checkout-process-ux-design-case-study"">UX Case Amazon’s Checkout Process: UX Design Case Study 2024</a></figcaption></figure><p>Now imagine if the the entire Amazon checkout process was converted into a similar ChatGPT wall of text. It would be both confusing and would open a lot of room for error (or manipulation, depending on your worldview).</p><p>Customers would have to pay attention to things like credit card details, addresses, the order’s exact name, and the price, all in one shot. Would you feel comfortable answering the chatbot below to go ahead with the purchase?</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*I0er-5Un_8aYs-Aj"" /></figure><h3>Friction is necessary in learning</h3><p>In the Amazon example above, the biggest problem is that the friction from trying to read all that text, and it breaks several of the classic <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/#poster"">10 usability heuristics</a>. We can agree, quite easily, that this is not an optimal way to help users buy a product from Amazon.</p><p>However, the simplification of a checkout flow into steps is primarily to reduce errors. When it comes to learning, sometimes simplification can be a way to add <em>necessary friction</em> to improve learning outcomes.</p><p>Take a look at the <strong>Additional context</strong> that ChatGPT provides as a second step. It opens that bulleted list with “To get us started,” despite the the paragraph right before explicitly saying “Before we dig in.”</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sLET8jccMblJT61u_QVM-Q.png"" /></figure><p>This is troubling because the LLM almost had an opportunity to stop after <strong>Requirements gathering</strong> to allow the students time to provide more information and reflect on their needs. If it wasn’t for the incessant push to please users with easy answers, ChatGPT might have been a good tool for this kind of deeper introspection.</p><p>Instead, in providing all four of these steps in one answers, the LLM is inadvertently making it incredibly easy for the student to bypass the entire point of writing an essay. Finding relevant context and structuring an argument are the richest part of writing an assignment. If we care about the <em>content</em> of an essay and not just the <em>form</em>, the student needs to understand how to pick the right research and where to place it for a coherent point to be made.</p><p>Below you can see how ChatGPT first asks them for more details, automatically does research for them, provides a structure, and finally then asks them if they’d like to be walked through each step.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Dq4aIgz0BIC1-H7tqVqAtA.png"" /></figure><p>The unintended result is a path of least resistance that lets students bypass the very process of learning. And when a student is facing a deadline, that path is understandably tempting.</p><p>So I did what a busy student might do: I took the AI’s follow-up question as a helpful nudge. I ignored the first question about my grade and simply replied “yes” to the last one. ChatGPT, happy to oblige, did exactly what all instructors are dreading so much.</p><p>It began providing “guiding questions,” which aren’t bad at face value, but this is where ChatGPT’s verbosity compensation surprised me with a problem I didn’t expect. <strong>It often provides the answer within the question itself.</strong></p><p>For example, it asks, “What geographical features made Montreal ideal as a trading hub?” and then immediately adds, “A key point is the strategic location.”</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*5QdtMBw6t6nGUTqD"" /><figcaption>Red and blue show how questions one and two are answered only bullet points apart.</figcaption></figure><p>This essentially turns the task from a critical thinking prompt into a ‘fill-in-the-blanks’ exercise. The kind of activity that is less likely to build long-term understanding, essentially rendering such assignments into a charade of the original intention.</p><h3>Breaking the consistency needed for good UX</h3><p>The last point before we get into the solutions is how the very nature of LLMs break’s one of the golden rules for good UX: consistent behaviors to the same user actions.</p><p>This is a significant challenge for any educator trying to use this tool in a classroom. Both because students might independently get very different quality of support, and because any prompting tips provided by the teacher might not always work as intended.</p><p>I ran the exact same prompt three times and received three very different learning paths.</p><ul><li>One gave a full essay structure.</li><li>Another asked me to choose a focus (a more effective approach).</li><li>The third invited me to reflect on the topic myself (even better for learning).</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*eSEFPY0rjHS6WvqNVrRTJg.png"" /></figure><p>This inconsistency makes it difficult to rely on the tool for structured educational activities. It’s a tough design problem to solve, because it’s the foundation of how LLMs generate answers. But if we want to make tools where teachers and students can align on how to make them work, then we have much better chances of creating effective AI learning strategies for students. It’s crucial for creating a trustworthy learning environment.</p><p>So, what’s the opportunity? We can design for deeper learning.</p><h3>Designing with scaffolding and deeper learning</h3><p>As a designer, this is the part that gets me excited. We have a huge opportunity to build something even more effective. Instead of a single text dump, imagine an interface that uses scaffolding, guiding a student one intentional step at a time.</p><p>It could start by only asking for the student’s needs.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*DN6nn_D-C-K_0AEB"" /></figure><p>From there, it could introduce different essay types, explaining the pros and cons of each. This transforms the interaction into a series of small, manageable learning moments. More importantly, any context it provides would no longer about the content of the essay, but rather about the type. This helps students make <em>informed decisions</em> and develop a deeper understanding of why they are doing what they’re doing.</p><p>The goal isn’t to stop giving students powerful tools, but to design those tools to foster better thinking habits.</p><p>In an ideal world, I’d even go as far as suggesting more visual ways for thinking with interactive cards that let students look at their different options and even let them explore the different pathways.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*yVugAxUVmRftf3-X"" /></figure><p>Why limit the answers to just text inputs and outputs? We’re slowly seeing research emerge that this kind of dynamic UI creation is possible with <a href=""https://research.google/blog/generative-ui-a-rich-custom-visual-interactive-user-experience-for-any-prompt/"">Google’s generative UI</a>. But even without fancy technology, we can use simple things like text fields, drop-downs, buttons, and lists or carousels to make the information easier to interact with.</p><h3>Moving towards LLMs made for learning</h3><p>I want to be clear that my deep dive on this UX is not simply about making more interactive components to help with learning. There are foundational differences in the ways we should be training LLMs for a learning context.</p><p>The best inspiration I’ve found on methods to approach this are people exploring concepts of “productive resistance” like Advait Sarkar. In his <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/advait_sarkar_how_to_stop_ai_from_killing_your_critical_thinking"">TED Talk</a>, towards he says the following about his research lab’s philosophy.</p><blockquote>“We take the position that the ability to think well is essential for human agency and empowerment and flourishing.”</blockquote><p>Instead, what we have today are machines that prioritize increasing our time spent using them, rather than maximizing the learning that can happen with them. And yet, I am hopeful because we are so early in the life of AI interfaces and the technology that the best innovations are yet to come.</p><p>There are so many opportunities for us, as designers to actually make this experience of studying with an AI something that changes education rather than continues to bypass the most important steps. If you are working in an educational setting on a project with a lot of opportunities for learning, I’ll end with a place that you can start your own learn.</p><p>Designers can become a lot more potent if we understand the human brain at a level much deeper than most design schools invite us to. Most of the time, the world of UX thinks of psychology as a list of cognitive biases and attention spans. But the brain is so much more interesting and incredible, and learning in and of itself is so much more than a function relegated to students at a school.</p><p>Instead, I invite you to start thinking of your work as something that can shape human cognition at levels that are far more subtle than what we’re used to with traditional interfaces. While in this example I explored the harm to students, these same shortcuts can impact anyone who’s trying to learn, collaborate, or create with AI.</p><p>Learning is one of the most fundamental functions of our intelligence. Perhaps now is the time for all of us working in technology to understand its mysteries a little more deeply. As we keep learning, we may soon discover the best techniques to build tools that, as Sarkar said, enable human agency, empowerment, and flourishing.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e4e7facde91e"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/chatgpt-talks-too-much-and-its-ruining-learning-e4e7facde91e"">ChatGPT talks too much and it’s ruining learning</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>How dark patterns are actually becoming legal liabilities</h4><figure><img alt=""Image of a big ol’ roach motel manager, representing Amazon"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*koghoada16AFTSMK8QZO2A.png"" /><figcaption>Image of a big ol’ roach motel manager, representing Amazon</figcaption></figure><p>With the holidays around the corner, I’ve been on an online shopping spree, and recently while on Amazon I stumbled upon a very disturbing trend. Right beside the item’s price, in bright red discount colours there’s a “–25%” discount text. Nothing particularly weird about that… except the “discounted” price was exactly the same as the price I’d seen a few days earlier. Using a price tracker, you can actually see that the listing was briefly restocked at a higher price purely to enable the 25% discount badge. The UI is screamin’ <em>you’re getting a bargain, you’d be silly not to grab it now</em>, while nothing has materially changed except my perception.</p><p>Back in the 1800s, shopping was more akin to a cat-and-mouse game, where prices were subjective and based on the individual shopkeeper’s whims. If demand picked up for a particular item, they could increase or discount. This all changed when a family known as the<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/28/opinion/dynamic-pricing-algorithms.html""> Quakers (of Quaker Oats fame) implemented what they called the “one price” option</a>. They started posting prices for things publicly, which allowed consumers to compare across stores, and that created a new kind of equilibrium and the humble price tag was born.</p><p>But in the age of the internet, the virtual shopkeepers have a lot more information to leverage against you. A thing called <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/100000010545598/dynamic-pricing-algorithms.html""><strong>dynamic pricing</strong></a>, the algorithmic reincarnation of old-school haggling, was invented. Explicitly designed to discover the highest price at which a sale can actually be made. As companies increasingly shared data and responded automatically to competitor listings, it has become easier than ever to keep prices in lockstep in favour of businesses and not consumers. These days, it’s not uncommon to find digital price tags updating in real time to match market conditions for optimal profit extraction. We’re back to fluid, opportunistic pricing, but now on steroids and supercharged by algorithms.</p><p>At the forefront of this new wild west of pricing and manipulation is Amazon. They use every method at their disposal to coax us into spending a few extra pennies, which when you have <a href=""https://amzscout.net/blog/amazon-statistics/"">310 million active users globally</a>, is not too shabby. Dark patterns: design choices that push people toward decisions that benefit the business at the user’s expense, are one of those tactics that I wanted to explore.</p><p>Amazon leans heavily on a pricing tactic known in consumer-protection circles as <a href=""https://competition-bureau.canada.ca/en/deceptive-marketing-practices/types-deceptive-marketing-practices/fake-sales-and-discounts""><strong>fake sales and discounts</strong></a> which essentially is inflating the “original” price so the current one looks like a bargain. In UX, this dark pattern doesn’t have an official name, though it clearly falls under interface interference and misdirection, but for the sake of this article, I’m gonna coin it <strong>Bezos Bargaining</strong>: the illusion of a “deal” created entirely through framing. Amazon presents a higher “list price,” your brain treats it as the baseline, so everything that follows feels like savings, even when nothing is actually being discounted.</p><figure><img alt=""Image showing the fake discount beside the listing price of the Amazon Fire TV’s"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/632/0*qdgUqliSGngbC51j.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.classaction.org/news/amazon-touted-fake-sale-prices-for-fire-tvs-class-action-suit-alleges"">Image showing the fake discount beside the listing price of the Amazon Fire TV’s</a></figcaption></figure><p>Recently, there was a <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/17/24247616/amazon-tricks-customers-into-buying-fire-tvs-with-fake-discounts-lawsuit-alleges"">class-action lawsuit</a>, where the plaintiffs showed that a bunch of Amazon products, including its own Fire TV, were advertised with massive markdowns even though they technically were just the “original” prices. <a href=""https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSPejLSgm/"">Price-tracking data even showed examples where the “sale” price was higher than what the product cost weeks earlier</a>.</p><p>Another of my fav’s is the classic <a href=""https://www.deceptive.design/types/hard-to-cancel""><strong>roach motel</strong></a>, which Amazon applied liberally to the Prime subscription flow. Aptly named after the exterminator trap, it’s easy to get in, nearly impossible to leave. It makes joining Prime seamless and canceling into an IQ and endurance test.</p><p>Signing up unintentionally is way too easy. At the checkout you’re presented with a giant, high-contrast button offering FREE delivery with Prime (often preselected by default). One click and you’re in a 30-day trial, whether you like it or not. Once you’re in, getting out becomes an odyssey. The cancellation flow forces you through a labyrinth, first a page asking you to “confirm,” then another urging you to pause instead and another warning you about the benefit’s you’ll lose, followed by the final, guilt-soaked screen offering a discounted rate if you stay. It’s a hall of mirrors designed to intentionally disorient. Just to add insult to injury, Amazon reportedly referred to this cancellation obstacle course as <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/21/amazon-prime-ftc-dark-patterns/""><strong>Project Iliad</strong></a>, named after the ancient epic about a war that took a decade to escape…</p><figure><img alt=""Image of one of the many screens in the Amazon Illyad cancellation flow showing all the ways their trying to make you stay"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*uxjXdMnGRWjMi2lq.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://stephen.fm/dark-patterns-in-the-wild-amazon-prime/"">Image of one of the many screens in the Amazon Illyad cancellation flow showing all the ways their trying to make you st</a></figcaption></figure><p>Recently Amazon lost a landmark case, because of this design strategy and we’re ordered to pay a staggering <a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-ftc-settlement-prime-dark-patterns/"">$2.5 billion settlement.</a> The largest consumer protection lawsuit in history, and it hinged on the well-known dark pattern Roach Motel. What makes this case historic isn’t the hefty dollar amount. It’s the precedent! For the first time at this scale, a court treated UI and UX decisions like button placement, flow ordering, default selections or the strategic use of friction as tools of deception. Dark patterns are officially becoming a legal liability!</p><p>Also, it’s important to acknowledge that these dark patterns, especially for large tech companies aren’t purely the responsibility of the designers. More often than not, the UX designer doesn’t get to cherry-pick the problems to solve and Amazon is famously data-driven. It’s easy to imagine how analytics could nudge a team towards a pattern like this. We’ve all been in grey zones, but that’s why one of the most useful things we can do is arm ourselves with strong arguments.</p><p>There’s a company called <a href=""https://www.fairpatterns.com/"">Fairpatterns</a>, a legal entity created specifically to build frameworks around deceptive design, and they make a compelling business case against dark patterns. The way they frame it isn’t just an ethical plea; they use business language. By saying that dark patterns are short-term optimizations with long-term costs. And while it might cause a spike in conversions for a quarter or two, it also might erode trust, reduce customer lifetime value and, as the latest Amazon case showed, expose you to legal risk.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*NggrkyjFFPLkMTk5.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.fairpatterns.com/post/amazons-2-5b-dark-patterns-settlement-what-all-e-retailers-must-change-now"">FairPatterns graphic showing the longterm consequences of using dark patterns</a></figcaption></figure><p>Their framing prompts us to ask stakeholders good questions like:</p><ul><li>What’s the cost of losing user trust?</li><li>How does unintentional retention affect lifetime value?</li><li>What are the risks of doing this to our brand’s equity?</li><li>and finally, even though unlikely, could this flow get us sued?</li></ul><p>And if the stick doesn’t work, there are always the carrots! It’s not a fact that every major corporation MUST use dark patterns. There are major companies that actually leverage their respect for their users as a sales strategy. Apple’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5&amp;v=vu3_01y4sLk&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fappleinsider.com%2Finside%2Fapple-and-privacy%3Futm_source%3Dchatgpt.com&amp;source_ve_path=MjM4NTE"">privacy initiatives</a> show how pro-user defaults can become strategic differentiators. Basecamp, for example, has spent years publicly advocating for opinionated, user-respecting design in their books <a href=""https://basecamp.com/books#rework"">Getting Real, REWORK, and It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work</a>. They explicitly champion simplicity, honesty, and avoiding manipulative tactics, including making it easy for people to leave! And their product reflects those values. Even Spotify, which is currently very much on my naughty list for <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/spotify-has-an-ai-problem-a4d6729c715b"">unrelated reasons</a>, allows for fairly painless cancellation, I recently learned.</p><p>There are lots of examples of companies that don’t require the use of dark patterns to succeed. They treat user trust as an asset that compounds over time. It isn’t necessarily an ethical argument, for them its a pragmatic business strategy! And while not every company is going to be sued for $2.5 billion, the next time a client or manager asks you to implement a dark pattern, maybe send them this New York Times article and see what they think.</p><figure><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/25/technology/amazon-ftc-settlement.html""><img alt=""Screenshot of New York Times Article about Amazon’s 2.5 Billion Dollar Claim Settlement"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*c_cH3HbWHOyofk21M8ARXQ.png"" /></a></figure><p>PS: Don’t actually do that unless your boss is extremely chill.

Musk complains — I mean <em>tweets</em> — a lot, and tech acquisitions happen often, but these two examples illustrate how corporate interests and governments are connected. This text will show this corporate-governmental interplay. I will do this by looking at social media timeline design.</p><p>Facebook has been <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20110925211838/http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150286921207131"">experimenting with algorithmically showing posts</a> since 2011. However, the real transformation occurred in early 2016, when <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/15/filteredgram/"">Instagram</a> and <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/10/twitter-rolls-out-tool-to-give-users-option-for-algorithmic-timeline.html"">Twitter</a> adopted a <em>smart</em> timeline. From this moment on, users are bombarded with posts from accounts they never willfully subscribed to. This UX design adjustment, driven by KPIs and user engagement, has an impact in several ways.</p><p>I will use several thinkers to illustrate the social effects of these UX choices. I will begin with political theorist Jodi Dean, who lays out <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214988432-capital-s-grave"">4 features of <em>neo-feudalism</em></a>:</p><ol><li><strong>Parcellated sovereignty </strong>— the fragmentation of powers</li><li><strong>Lords and serfs</strong> — a small group of elites holding power over an economically vulnerable population</li><li><strong>Hinterlandisation</strong> — the thriving of cities at the expense of rural areas</li><li><strong>Catastrophic anxiety</strong></li></ol><p>I will first turn to how <em>anxiety</em> has infiltrated society via social media feeds. For Dean, feelings of insecurity and anxiety are linked to a lack of stability in life. For instance, by not having financial savings or social security. Dean states that:</p><blockquote>‘Neofeudalism’s catastrophic anxiety flourishes in the affective infrastructures of communicative capitalism where there is no commonly shared meaning. Lies circulate as easily as or more easily than truth.’ <br /> — <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214988432-capital-s-grave"">Jodi Dean</a></blockquote><p>This form of <em>anxiety</em> is about financial vulnerability. Still, less obvious aspects, like algorithm-driven <em>information</em>, also contribute to this feeling.</p><p>While someone in the past might have bought newspapers, people today often get their news through social media. Regardless, ‘[conventional] media outlets act in accordance with the <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1080/01972243.2023.2230471"">incentives created by Facebook</a>.’ Media, therefore, make their content more attractive for social media users. The number of <em>likes</em> or <em>shares</em> represent an online currency and functions as ‘<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448211027174"">popularity cues for editors</a>.’</p><p><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1080/1461670x.2023.2263799"">Media outlets thus adapt to social media’s ecosystem</a>. They negotiate newsworthiness with engagement. This includes adding more emojis, question marks, exclamation marks, and emotional words?!!? Editors are also writing clickbait titles. This leads to Dean’s idea of <em>catastrophic anxiety </em>and less precision at the ‘detriment of journalistic quality.’</p><blockquote>“When a free man is voting, it is not enough that the truth is known by someone else, by some scholar or administrator or legislator. The voters must have it, all of them.”<br /> — Alexander Meiklejohn</blockquote><p>One could argue that sensationalism might not per se harm being well-informed, but the simplification of news definitely does.</p><blockquote>‘Less important aspects of a news story are exposed at the expense of the core information, leaving readers less or even insufficiently informed.’<br /> — <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1080/1461670x.2023.2263799"">Source</a></blockquote><p>Anxiety and sensation are prioritised over accuracy.</p><p>Not only does news become less reliable, the content shifts as well. Culture war topics have become more prominent than economic news. This started with the birth of U.S. cable news in the late 1990s and has been accelerated by social media. ‘Switching from an entirely cultural to entirely economic segment reduces viewership,’ therefore…</p><blockquote>‘the focus on the culture war reflects a distinctive business strategy focused on audience size maximization.’</blockquote><blockquote>‘[News has] seen a shift in public politial attention: the tax, social insurance, and labor policies … have largely been eclipsed by cleavages over racial and gender issues, political correctness, immigration, religion, guns, and crime.’<br /> — <a href=""http://dropbox.com/scl/fi/27v4xxenpo8wotkw1238e/rao-jmp.pdf"">Source</a> (all 3 quotes above)</blockquote><p>Hence, social media platforms influence how journalism is conducted. It also impacts the content users consume and the topics relevant in public and political discourse.</p><figure><img alt=""Brexit culture war campaign"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*RpF9kl2Qt3gfDUTs.jpg"" /><figcaption>Brexit culture war campaign — ukip.org</figcaption></figure><p>The 2016 U.S. presidential elections and the Brexit referendum were the first major elections after the introduction of the algorithmic timeline. These events might suggest that ‘the fragmentation of social media and the role of sentiment, could <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1108/EJM-07-2019-0598."">enhance political polarization</a>.’ The smart timeline has thus contributed to the perhaps somewhat surprising result of both elections.</p><p>These elections can help us understand the ongoing trend where culture-war issues are more important than economic policies. People become less engaged with socioeconomic issues. Musk and the TikTok investors are given an opportunity to further neoliberalise society, and they want to take it.</p><p>As comparative literature scholar <a href=""https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/id/eprint/132076/"">Stephen Shapiro</a> paraphrases philosopher Michel Foucault:</p><blockquote>‘Neoliberalism insists on the necessity of relying on the competitive market as the normative model for all institutions, while on the other, it vastly amplifies the State’s institutional violence.’</blockquote><p>The role of the government is not to leave the market alone, but to promote it. Neoliberalism relies on game theory. It assumes everyone is constantly thinking about how to maximise their self-interest. Endless competition.</p><p>Foucault argues that neoliberalism should be understood alongside <em>governmentality.</em> Governmentality doesn’t lean on traditional disciplinary action. Instead, it relies on mechanisms designed to ensure people continuously adapt to changing guidelines. Conditioning the herd.</p><p>For Foucault, new techniques of control are always a response to society's demands and emotions. For instance, today’s sentiment about child groomers is used by <a href=""https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-10-2025-003250_EN.html"">the EU to justify giving <em>intel</em> organisations access to any individual’s private messages</a>.</p><p>These forms of <em>security</em> (or <em>biopolitics</em>) create an optimal social balance. <em>Security</em> uses existing environments to ensure a desirable outcome, whatever that might be. “Decent” people mostly.</p><p>Social media timelines can be among the systems used to condition people. This is a process Foucault calls <em>normation</em>. Normation creates an optimal model with specific outcomes that should nudge individuals to comply.</p><p>Foucault’s <em>security</em> doesn’t result from intentional design but from a series of techniques and institutions that gradually converge.</p><blockquote>‘The mechanism of security involves, in short, a series of processes which are, up to a certain point, aleatory and which it is only at the end and, as it were, a posteriori, that one will be able to say: this was a good security mechanism, it worked.’ <br /> — <a href=""https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/philosophy/intranets/undergraduate/modules/ph348/2013-14/foucault_-_security_territory_population_11_jan_1978__25_jan_1978.pdf"">Michel Foucault</a></blockquote><p>Belgian scholar <a href=""https://researchportal.unamur.be/en/persons/arouvroy/"">Antoinette Rouvroy</a> calls the way social media controls and shapes populations <em>algorithmic governmentality</em>.</p><figure><img alt=""People using their phone in public transport"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*fWAT60miqkOXliP6"" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=""https://unsplash.com/@hughhan?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Hugh Han</a> on <a href=""https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>A further impact of algorithms results from<em> rich-get-richer dynamics</em>. Popular content is promoted by the algorithm, resulting in feeds having less niche and more mainstream content.</p><p>Why this is problematic is explained by French philosopher Jacques Rancière. He claims that a broad <em>police force </em>decides who is allowed to speak, who should be heard, and who matters. For Rancière,<em> the police</em> refers to the act of policing and is about the institutions and systems that maintain social hierarchies.</p><blockquote>‘The police is thus first an order of bodies that defines the allocation of ways of doing, ways of being, and ways of saying, and sees that those bodies are assigned by name to a particular place and task.’ <br /> — <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/809331.Disagreement"">Jacques Rancière</a></blockquote><p>Because algorithms enable the mainstream to push out minorities and their ideas, social media thus decides who belongs to the virtual society and who should be excluded. The excluded and marginalised are those Rancière calls those <em>without a share</em> (<em>les sans-part</em>). By being shadow-banned, these groups are <em>wronged</em> (<em>le tort</em>).</p><p>Personalised timelines also lead to <em>filter bubbles</em>. Because platforms optimise for engagement, <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118x.2021.1883707"">users are shown content that interests them</a> and aligns with their viewpoints. This creates aversion to the unfamiliar. This effect, called <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infoecopol.2023.101020"">the <em>algorithm paradox</em></a><em>, </em>reduces exposure to contradictory opinions. Something that is, of course, essential for a healthy debate. <em>Normation </em>happens when<em> </em>people become unfamiliar with the unfamiliar.</p><p>Whereas algorithms create <em>filter bubbles</em>, <em>echo chambers</em> result from individual users’ selection behaviour. Users tend to select channels they agree with and exclude conflicting information. They also join groups of like-minded peers.</p><blockquote>‘According to group polarisation theory, an echo chamber can act as a mechanism to reinforce existing opinions moving the entire group toward more extreme positions.’<br /> — <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2022.101407"">Source</a></blockquote><p><em>Group polarisation theory</em> works alongside <em>post-liking</em> biases within the entire group. This ‘creates a <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1080/10584609.2020.1713267"">self-perpetuating cycle</a>, where attitudinally congruent articles remain at the top of the feed.’</p><p>Because of limited exposure to differing opinions and only reading posts from like-minded individuals, people rarely change their viewpoints. Users who ‘flip stances have significantly more neighbors engaging in a <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1109/tnse.2022.3185785."">collective expression of the opposite stance</a>.’</p><p>All the mechanisms discussed so far explain how social media supports the ‘neoliberal mode of government which produces the subjects it needs’ and how <em>catastrophic anxiety</em> is stimulated.</p><p>Today’s algorithmic culture is transforming the world into a <em>post-truth political age.</em> It makes the liberal decades almost obsolete.</p><blockquote>[Social media algorithms] were never designed to operate through liberal principles, since the ensuing algorithmic profile is not a collective public, or even a counterpublic, but an entirely different entity altogether.<br /> — <a href=""https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/id/eprint/132076/"">Stephen Shapiro</a> (and quote above)</blockquote><p>Dean claims that the reduction of the power of the people has been intentional. While this process began in the 1970s, today’s state of affairs results in a situation in which ‘private economic power trumps public law.’ This not only reduces the policy options available to states but also actively erodes popular sovereignty.</p><p>Governments <em>privatise</em> their nation-state and hand over control to companies, supported by subsidies and tax breaks. This, in turn, puts governments ‘in a position where they can no longer meet basic social needs and so remain bound to private firms until the firms decide to leave.’ Corporations abuse this reliance and threaten to leave, thus bullying governments further.</p><p>The corporate world is gradually becoming the government. You see where this is going. This trend is clearly visible at today’s White House. Lobbying practices, donations, and industry specialists move towards Washington, and <a href=""https://www.ituc-csi.org/corporate-underminers-of-democracy-2025."">massive corporate contracts circle back</a>. ‘I donate a big bag of money to some nonsense event, and I get a nice tariff reduction or a government contract in return.

It may thus not be a shocker that a group of investors, including Oracle co-founder and <a href=""https://www.timesofisrael.com/record-53-8-million-raised-for-idf-soldiers-at-beverly-hills-gala/"">IDF philanthropist</a> Larry Ellison and <a href=""https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-andreessen-horowitz-boosting-israel-vc-investments-1001503552"">Israeli tech ecosystem investor</a> Marc Andreessen, is buying TikTok.</p><p><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/09/25/tiktok-deal-sale-algorithm-changes/"">A senior White House official expressed</a> that</p><blockquote><em>‘</em>ByteDance’s reworked algorithm for a U.S. TikTok would use data from only American users and would be overseen by Oracle.

You start noticing design and engineering overlapping at scale much earlier, pretty much as soon as a feature moves from research into the ideation stage.</p><figure><img alt=""Screen recording of an AI-powered analytics prototype.

I designed the experience, developed the UI with ShadCN components, built the interaction patterns, and connected it to real logic in the background. The prototype pulled data through Supabase MCP calls and interacted with OpenAI APIs to generate adaptive UI components, so the whole thing behaved close to the final product experience rather than a typical mock or demo.</p><p>This shift in how I solve problems pushed me beyond prototyping. I started productionizing my work inside the codebase, learning engineering patterns every day, and developing a clearer sense of how the product should function from end to end across the entire system.</p><blockquote>It moved me from being a designer to becoming a maker, and it is now shaping me into a <strong>context-aware builder</strong>.</blockquote><p>This article is a reflection of that journey, how it improved the velocity, the challenges I encountered, and what we should anticipate, that could define the next chapter of product design development.</p><h3>The Problem I Kept Running Into</h3><p>When the <a href=""https://spin.atomicobject.com/designers-vibe-coding/"">vibe coding culture</a> started appearing everywhere, I saw significant people from the design community building retro games, dashboards, weather widgets, note apps, and many experiments powered by AI-generated code. It was encouraging to see designers making ideas work, but it reminded me of the famous <a href=""https://dribbble.com/"">Dribbble</a> phase where everything looked beautiful but very little made it into real products.</p><p>I kept asking myself:</p><blockquote>Is this just another playground? Or can this way of working eventually influence production software?</blockquote><p>The understanding of what sits under the hood among the community was still early, and most prototypes focused more on exploration than real functionality. It felt like the community is just beginning to scratch the surface of what is possible.</p><p>The bigger issue was not the experiments themselves. It was that designers still did not have a functional layer to work in. This gap between design and development has been <a href=""https://webdesignerdepot.com/the-designer-developer-handoff-is-still-broken-why/"">well-documented</a>, with many teams struggling to move from static mockups to functional products. Figma, the most common tool designers use, sits in an isolated space. Even with custom plugins, Code Connect, and dev mode, the influence on the codebase is minimal. Most of it feels like a workaround. The design mocks rarely have the ability to test with real or dynamic data.</p><p>The other challenge is<strong> feature fragmentation</strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""Figma project view showing a grid of separate design files, illustrating how individual features are organized into their own design files."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dzXHJTKOo0BIsQkJrOcUpg.png"" /></figure><p>In Figma, each feature is usually worked on in a separate file. It gives clarity for design, but it does not reflect how a real product works. In an actual product, features live together, share context, depend on each other, and behave as a single system. Moving across flows should feel natural and connected, not scattered across isolated files.</p><p>If you look at the distribution, the user interacts with the final product. Testers have staging and UAT environments. Developers have a full git workflow with branches and review layers. <strong>Designers do not have anything equivalent. </strong>There is no layer that lets us build with a real functional context.</p><h3>Where I Started: Two Paths</h3><p>My initial integration of AI into my workflow was actually quite practical. I was trying to optimize some design operations and design system workflows, and I did not have enough bandwidth to fit all of it into my routine. There was no AI integration inside IDEs at that time. Everything was manual, disconnected, and very experimental. So used AI generated scripts for these automations.</p><figure><img alt=""Side-by-side graphic showing an early AI-assisted workflow.

During the same timeline, I was exploring prototyping with Origami and wanted to see if I could bring AI capability directly into the prototype. I experimented with building an Origami prototype that used the OpenAI API for chat completion requests and audio-to-text conversion</p><figure><img alt=""Animated gif of music controller touch interface where interaction emerges without visible buttons and purely based on contextual feedback and motion."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/956/1*0yMZrq2MCBYpNd-BHvKbYg.gif"" /><figcaption>Whisper API from Open AI for converting song audio into lyrics</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=""Animated prototype gif of live camera feed, where the user drag to select any region.

Understanding this separation became an important part of how I now approach prototyping ideas.</p><h3>Finding the Right Tools</h3><p>As I started building more rigorously, I needed to settle on tools that matched my workflow. I explored several options including <a href=""https://v0.app/"">v0</a> for quick layouts and <a href=""https://cursor.com/"">Cursor</a> for its smooth IDE experience, but token exhaustion rate became a practical constraint.</p><p><a href=""https://claude.com/product/claude-code"">Claude Code</a> stood out for its efficiency. Using the same Sonnet model across different tools, Claude Code handled tokens far better and stayed lightweight for repeated everyday use. It began as a simple terminal interface but quickly became my primary tool because it fit the way I build products every day.</p><p>The rise of MCPs (Model Context Protocol) also meant that most missing features could be achieved across different AI-powered IDEs anyway. What mattered more was finding a tool that matched my cost and workflow needs for sustained use.</p><h3>Where I Arrived: The Shadow Repo Approach</h3><p>I came across a <a href=""https://x.com/nayakkayak/status/1958677324863328643?s=20"">tweet</a> by Aatish Nayak, VP product at Harvey, about building an entire frontend using vibe coding. He called it a <strong>shadow repo</strong>, and the idea made immediate sense. The concept addresses what <a href=""https://smart-interface-design-patterns.com/articles/design-handoff/"">Dan Mall and Brad Frost call the ‘Hot Potato Process’</a>, rapid iteration between designers and developers that eliminates traditional handoff friction.</p><p>Think of it like this: if staging/UAT is where testers validate features, a shadow repo is where designers validate functionality. This approach creates breathing room to experiment with full product context and less risk.</p><p>A real git branch carries engineering expectations, reviews, and risk. A shadow repo removes that pressure. You can try ideas, break things, and test with real or mock data without touching the product codebase.</p><p>Here is how I shaped workflow with this shadow repo:</p><ul><li>Build a repo that mirrors the real app structure</li><li>Follow production component patterns</li><li>Use Figma for skeleton and visual direction</li><li>Translate with Figma MCP, applying coded design system rules</li><li>Refine through manual edits and prompting</li><li>Use Notion MCP for handoff review notes</li><li>Port to production with developer review and proper API wiring</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Flow diagram showing how design and code inputs feed into a shadow repository.

This breaks down when replicating a full product experience.</p><p>I created a shadow backend using Supabase. Supabase’s free tier plus <a href=""https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/mcp"">Supabase MCP tools </a>were perfect for this: quick tables, simple edge functions, instant data edits, predictable structure. This made the shadow repo feel complete.</p><blockquote>This enabled: Functional UI + Coded Interactions + Real Data</blockquote><figure><img alt=""Flow diagram showing how three inputs feed into a shadow repo workflow.

My prototypes needed to behave like AI-powered products. I integrated lightweight OpenAI API calls to replicate real-world feature responses.</p><p>Supabase made this efficient. I could store conversation history, manage state, and handle AI responses without complex backend logic. MCP tools connected everything seamlessly for defining actual API calls, response processing, and dynamic interface updates.</p><p>And for inspecting within the browser by the agent during active development, the <a href=""https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-devtools-mcp"">Chrome Dev Tools MCP</a> solves it with my Claude setup.</p><h3>What I Gained from Building Functionally</h3><p>This approach doesn’t require designers to become full engineers, a <a href=""https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/designers-coding"">decades-old debate</a> that often misses the point. As <a href=""https://capwatkins.com/blog/why-designers-really-should-learn-to-code"">Cap Watkins argues</a>, learning to code isn’t about independence but about deepening collaboration and shared understanding.</p><p>With this setup, I was able to prototype working features and ship much faster. In one instance, the developers reviewed the prototype code and had the production version ready for testing in a single evening. That was the moment I realized this workflow is quite practical, scalable and increase the velocity to a greater extent. I was no longer handing off design files. I was handing off a working prototype with a higher probability of accurately representing the idea into production quickly.</p><figure><img alt=""Animated neon illustration of two outlined human heads facing each other, with glowing brains connected by looping, pulsating energy bands."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/0*69dzyRxN3kU5bKMx.gif"" /></figure><p>These are some of the shifts I noticed in my approach:</p><p><strong>Better fine-tuning of UI component architecture: </strong>Seeing components run with real variants, props, and constraints helped me refine the architecture upfront and create cleaner, more scalable patterns.</p><p><strong>Handling Edge Cases Early:</strong> AI made it easier to surface edge cases and logical gaps early, long before engineering touched them.</p><p><strong>Thinking Through the Data Layer:</strong> Working with real-like data broadened my thinking on structuring payloads and designing interface for efficient API usage and holistic thinking of how data flows through the entire system functionally.</p><p><strong>Enabling AI Features to Augment Capabilities:</strong> Integrating actual AI behavior into prototypes changed how I think about product features. Instead of designing around static functionality, I started considering how AI could augment existing capabilities.</p><h3>How This Changed My Role in Problem Solving</h3><p>This entire experiment changed my perspective on what it means to be a designer.</p><p>When you understand how data flows, how components are structured, what triggers API calls, and what engineers worry about, your design decisions become grounded in reality.</p><blockquote>You stop thinking like someone who “hands off” and start thinking like someone who builds.</blockquote><figure><img alt=""Animated gif of minimalist illustration of an open hand holding a simple outlined 3D house shape resting on a flat platform"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Wt8AEi9FyLKbiqZY.gif"" /></figure><h3>The Challenges That Come With It</h3><p>AI coding tools are powerful, but they also come with real headaches:</p><p><strong>The rabbit-hole edits:</strong> AI produces the first version well, but small edits sometimes break the entire flow and get you into an unnecessary loop of issues.</p><p><strong>Pattern-level mistakes:</strong> With React components, I have faced unnecessary hooks, redundant functions, nested components, strange abstractions, and recursive API calls.</p><p><strong>AI fingerprints:</strong> AI often generates the same UI patterns for the same problem and ignores existing components.</p><p><strong>Overbuilding:</strong> It is easy to drift into solving engineering problems and lose sight of the actual user problem.</p><p>However, these challenges eventually can be addressed by defining rules that you can mention in your AI tool. In Claude, this is supported by <a href=""https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices"">Claude.md</a> and <a href=""https://www.claude.com/blog/skills"">Claude Skills</a>, which are project-agnostic and allow you to define explicit conditions and rules that guide how the AI should approach your programming tasks.</p><h3>What This Means Going Forward</h3><p>The way we build products is shifting steadily. AI coding tools are changing the relationship between design and engineering. Shadow repos and vibe-coded prototypes let designers get much closer to reality. Complexity becomes easier to reason about. Ideas get validated faster.</p><blockquote>Teams spend less time interpreting and more time building.</blockquote><p>We are moving from designer to maker to builder through changes in capability.</p><p>This mirrors what <a href=""https://www.uxtigers.com/post/vibe-coding-vibe-design"">Jakob Nielsen describes as ‘vibe design’</a>, where AI enables rapid prototyping and designers work more iteratively with functional interfaces rather than static deliverables.</p><p>The shadow repo approach might not be a permanent solution. It is a good transitional framework that works while the industry figures out what the next generation of product-building tools should be. Right now, this framework works well for our team to build functionally without the constraints of traditional tools or the risks of production systems.</p><p>The industry is figuring this out together. If you are exploring similar territory or approaching these problems differently, let’s connect and learn from each other.</p><p><em>If you are curious to see more of my work, check out my </em><a href=""https://www.pratheep.design""><em>portfolio</em></a><em> where I have documented some of these experiments.</em></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=fb3924f83da1"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/productionizing-design-prototypes-addressing-the-design-engineering-gap-with-ai-coding-tools-fb3924f83da1"">Addressing the design-engineering gap with AI coding tools</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Moving from accidental learning to deliberate capability development.</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vp3jzP0mKvpYW8zZh5x68Q.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>The retrospective felt like a breakthrough. The team diagnosed exactly where their reasoning broke down, mapped the root causes, and committed to doing better. Three months later, they repeated the same mistakes.</p><p>The diagnosis was accurate. What was missing was a system to turn awareness into development. Diagnosis alone doesn’t create change.</p><p>Most improvement efforts fail not from lack of insight, but from lack of judgment infrastructure. Teams recognize that they skip assumption testing or misinterpret customer feedback. But recognition without practice is just self-awareness that fades.</p><p>In my previous article, “<a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/the-anatomy-of-product-discovery-judgment-0cb28b28cc7c"">The anatomy of discovery judgment</a>,” I mapped the 19 critical judgment points where human reasoning determines whether teams build the right things.</p><p>This article introduces the remaining components of the Discovery Judgment Framework: how to <em>measure</em> judgment quality, the <em>practices</em> that systematically strengthen it, and the <em>maturity model</em> that tracks your progress over time.</p><h3><strong>Measuring Your Progress: Four Quality Dimensions</strong></h3><p>You can’t develop what you can’t see. Teams track velocity, output, and outcomes — but the quality of judgment remains hidden. Yet judgment determines whether that velocity produces value or waste.</p><p>Where the 19 judgment points show where to focus, these four dimensions show how well you’re reasoning at each point. Think of each as a 1–5 scale: low-judgment teams typically score 1.5–2, while high-judgment teams score 4–4.5.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hTCjYVDTQjpgdZK6souu7Q.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>Use the diagram to rate your team honestly on each dimension. Without clear feedback loops and deliberate reflection, teams miss critical learning opportunities — a pattern White (2021) identified in his research on reflection in design practice.</p><h4><strong>Example of judgment quality in action</strong></h4><p><strong>Low judgment</strong>: “We decided to build feature X” (no documented reasoning)</p><p><strong>High judgment</strong>: “We prioritized feature X over Y because: (1) it tests our riskiest assumption about user adoption, (2) engineering complexity is 2 weeks vs 6 months, (3) three customers said they’d pilot it immediately, giving us rapid validation.”</p><p>Most teams operate with low judgment quality without realizing it. Making these four dimensions visible is the first step to improvement.</p><h3>Your Journey: The Maturity Model</h3><p>Think of judgment development as a maturity curve, not a binary state. The Discovery Judgment Framework’s fourth component shows how capability evolves.</p><figure><img alt=""A diagram illustrating a five-level maturity model, progressing from “Level 1: Unconscious” at the bottom-left to “Level 5: Self-Improving” at the top-right. Each level includes a description and a typical timeframe."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*k1YN4KOJ3IGCri46DoBQ7g.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>Most teams begin at Levels 1–2 and progress to Levels 3–4 within 6–18 months through consistent practice. Reaching Level 5 may take years, but it becomes self-reinforcing.</p><p>Maturity models provide teams with clear progression paths. Ballarín’s (2022) work on UX maturity for Scrum teams shows how these frameworks help identify where to focus capability development next.</p><h3>Where are you now?</h3><p>Honestly assess your team’s current level:</p><ul><li><strong>Level 1 — Unaware</strong>: We don’t have a systematic approach to discovery. We can’t explain why we made past decisions. Learning happens by accident.</li><li><strong>Level 2 — Aware</strong>: We recognize judgment matters. We sometimes employ practices such as assumption mapping or evidence tracking, but not consistently. We’re starting to document reasoning.</li><li><strong>Level 3 — Practicing</strong>: We consistently use 2–3 core practices. We can trace most decisions back to evidence. Reflection is becoming routine. We’re deliberate about judgment development.</li><li><strong>Level 4 — Systematic</strong>: All five practices are integrated into our workflow. We measure judgment quality routinely. Learning compounds across cycles. Judgment development is no longer special — it’s how we work.</li><li><strong>Level 5 — Self-Improving</strong>: Judgment development feels natural. New team members absorb these capabilities through osmosis. We continuously refine our approach. The system reinforces itself.</li></ul><p>In my experience working with product teams, most start at Level 1 or 2. The practices below move you to Level 3–4 over 6–18 months.</p><h3>The Five Practices That Strengthen Judgment</h3><p>Moving up the maturity curve requires systematic practices — the framework’s third component. These work with whatever process frameworks you use (Agile, Design Thinking, OKRs). The question isn’t what tools you use, but whether they enable judgment development.</p><p>Start with one core practice (Evidence Tracking, Assumption Mapping, or Experiment Design). Add integration practices (Decision Documentation and Reflection Practice) as you mature.</p><h4>Three core practices</h4><p>These three practices generate and test insights:</p><p><strong>1. Evidence Tracking</strong> maintains the lineage from raw data to decisions — customer quotes connect to insights, opportunities, and ultimately decisions.</p><p><strong><em>Example</em></strong><em>:</em> After conducting 12 interviews, you identify “context loss during handoffs” as a recurring issue. Your evidence trail: 8 of 12 mentioned it, 6 used similar language (“black hole”), 40% of support escalations involve missing information. You can trace decisions to specific evidence — and if solutions fail, review whether you misinterpreted evidence or solved the wrong problem.</p><p><strong>2. Assumption Mapping</strong> makes implicit beliefs explicit and testable — before building anything, articulate what must be true for success across five categories: Desirability, Feasibility, Viability, Usability, Ethics.</p><p>As Christopher (2024) explains in his Bootcamp article on UX mapping techniques, assumption mapping — typically used at project kickoff — helps teams identify which assumptions are significant unknowns requiring validation versus unimportant factors that can be deferred.</p><p><strong><em>Example</em></strong>: Your assumption map reveals: “Executives will log in daily” (riskiest), “We can build real-time sync in 2 sprints,” “This drives $500K in upsell.” After 2 weeks of testing, adoption stays below 40%. You pivot — executives prefer email summaries. That 2-week test saved $ 180,000.</p><p><strong>3. Experiment Design</strong> structures learning so each test produces actionable insight — each experiment has a clear hypothesis, success criteria, and decision threshold.</p><p><strong><em>Example</em></strong><em>:</em> Instead of an 18-month overhaul, you test a 2-week experiment with a simple template. After two weeks, adoption is 55% — managers use it, but team members often forget the details. You’ve learned the fundamental constraint in two weeks for minimal investment, not 18 months and $2 million later.</p><h4>Two integration practices</h4><p>These practices capture and compound learning:</p><p><strong>4. Decision Documentation</strong> records not just what was decided, but the reasoning behind it. Capture supporting evidence, assumptions carried forward, alternatives rejected, and confidence level. This creates institutional memory and enables the extraction of learning.</p><p><strong>5. Reflection Practice</strong> closes the learning loop. The key is examining what you learned about both the customer <em>and your own reasoning</em> — the double-loop learning introduced in my article “<a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/it-seems-anyone-can-build-software-now-how-do-you-build-the-right-software-182057dfa122"">When building software became easier with AI, deciding became harder.</a>”</p><p>Single-loop learning solves problems within existing systems; double-loop learning challenges the underlying beliefs and assumptions themselves. Overeem (2021) frames this as the difference between doing things right and questioning whether you’re doing the right things. Discovery judgment requires this deeper reflection — not just asking “Did this work?” but “Were our assumptions valid? Should we be asking different questions entirely?”</p><p>Schedule regular reflection — after launches, retrospectives, or quarterly — to examine: What surprised us? What would we do differently? What did this reveal about how we think?</p><h3>How the Framework Components Work Together</h3><p>The four components work as an integrated system: diagnose weak points, measure quality, apply practices, and track maturity. Each cycle strengthens both customer understanding and reasoning capability.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: Identify Evidence Interpretation as weak (Component 1) → assess quality (Component 2) → implement Evidence Tracking (Component 3) → progress from Level 2 to Level 3 over 6–12 months (Component 4).</p><p>The five practices form a continuous cycle: Evidence Tracking → Assumption Mapping → Experiment Design → Decision Documentation → Reflection Practice.</p><figure><img alt=""A circular diagram showing the five practices connected in a continuous cycle. Arrows flow from Evidence Tracking to Assumption Mapping, to Experiment Design, to Decision Documentation, and then to Reflection Practice, before returning to Evidence Tracking. At the center, text reads “Each cycle strengthens judgment about customers and reasoning.” The circular flow illustrates how practices integrate and compound learning over time."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*7n4sEFRTjcrc_DV1y3X9Pg.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><h3>Putting It Into Practice</h3><p>Judgment develops through two complementary approaches — and the integration of both creates sustainable capacity:</p><p><strong>Learning by doing</strong>: Apply practices to real discovery work. Learn from cycles. Find internal mentors who share their reasoning — not just decisions, but how they think about problems, what signals they watch for, what tradeoffs they consider.</p><p><strong>Structured learning</strong>: Targeted training on specific judgment points and practices. Deliberate skill-building. Systematic coverage of areas you might miss through experience alone.</p><p>The most effective approach combines both. Structured learning provides principles; experiential learning embeds them. Training teaches assumption mapping; projects teach which assumptions matter in your context. Neither alone creates lasting change — integration creates professionals who reason systematically and apply judgment contextually.</p><h4>Your implementation roadmap</h4><p>Regardless of where you are, start with the same first step.</p><p><strong>1. Today: Choose ONE practice that addresses your weak point:</strong></p><ul><li>Weak at Evidence Interpretation? → Start Evidence Tracking</li><li>Weak at Assumptions? → Start Assumption Mapping</li><li>Weak at Validation? → Start Experiment Design</li></ul><p><strong>2. This sprint: Implement that practice:</strong></p><ul><li>Set up the system (tools, templates, workflows)</li><li>Apply it to one active decision</li><li>Document what you learn</li></ul><p><strong>3. 30 days from now: Assess improvement using the four dimensions:</strong></p><ul><li>Can you trace the reasoning better? (Reasoning Transparency)</li><li>Are decisions more evidence-based? (Evidence Rigour)</li><li>Did you catch biases earlier? (Bias Awareness)</li><li>What changed in how you think? (Learning Depth)</li></ul><p><strong>4. After validation: Expand to a second practice or deepen the first.</strong></p><p>Whether working alone or as part of a team, the fundamentals remain the same — but each practice requires specific habits:</p><ul><li><strong>For Evidence Tracking:</strong> Keep a simple log linking each decision to specific customer quotes or data points. When a decision proves wrong, trace back to see where the interpretation failed.</li><li><strong>For Assumption Mapping:</strong> Before each sprint, list three assumptions that could invalidate your current direction. Rank them by risk and design one test.</li><li><strong>For Reflection:</strong> After each cycle, write one paragraph on what outcomes revealed about your reasoning process — not just about customers, but about how you interpreted signals and made tradeoffs.</li></ul><p>AI can surface patterns you might miss during reflection — contradictions in your reasoning, gaps in your evidence, assumptions you haven’t tested. But determining which patterns matter, and what they mean for your next decision, remains yours alone.</p><p>The goal isn’t perfect discovery — it’s learning to decide better with each cycle.</p><h3>Your Next Move</h3><p>You’re facing a real decision here.</p><p>One approach is to keep your focus on execution. When everything feels uncertain, doubling down on what you know how to do makes sense. It’s not wrong — it’s how most people will respond.</p><p>Another approach: Use this uncertainty to develop judgment incrementally. Begin with one practice at a single judgment point. Build the capacity while pressure is still manageable, before it becomes urgent.</p><p>Here’s what’s worth considering: As AI makes execution more efficient, organizations will need fewer people executing tasks and more people making informed decisions. The question isn’t whether to develop judgment — it’s whether to start now, while you can do it gradually, or later when the pressure is higher.</p><p>You don’t need to be brave. You don’t need to transform your organization. You don’t even need to tell anyone you’re doing this. Just pick one practice and apply it to one decision this week.</p><p>That’s how judgment develops — through small, deliberate actions repeated over cycles. Start now, and in a year you’ll have skills most of your peers will take years to develop — if they develop them at all. Speed and judgment used to be a tradeoff. Now they’re both required — and only one can be automated.</p><p><strong><em>The future belongs to those who decide well, not just deliver fast. That future can start now.</em></strong></p><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Four quality dimensions make judgment visible and measurable: Evidence Rigour, Reasoning Transparency, Bias Awareness/Ethical Alignment, and Learning Depth.</li><li>Teams progress through 5 maturity levels — most start at Level 1–2 and can reach Level 3–4 in 6–18 months through consistent practice.</li><li>Five practices strengthen judgment: three core practices (Evidence Tracking, Assumption Mapping, Experiment Design) plus two integration practices (Decision Documentation, Reflection Practice). Start with one core practice.</li><li>Two learning pathways work together: experiential learning through real-world projects and structured learning through targeted training. The integration of both creates lasting change.</li><li>Start narrow: one practice, one judgment point, prove value, then expand.</li></ul><h3>References</h3><p>Ballarín, A. (2022).

Qual vs. Quant? Who owns the insights? Who make the decisions? Who drives the strategy? Who makes the “real” impact?</p><p>I've been a UX Researcher for over 20 years and my thinking is deeply rooted in building meaningful products and services that solve real human problems… (As opposed to fake problems… you know, the kinds of problems that we invent in order to justify the product we're building-alas, I digress).</p><p>Over the last 5 years, my perspective has shifted greatly.</p><p>After founding Amplinate, working across Big Tech and other industries, consulting with CEOs and Entrepreneurs, and most importantly, collaborating directly with one of the top business coaches in the world, <a href=""https://www.abraham.com/"">Jay Abraham</a>, I’ve come to a humbling conclusion about Research:</p><blockquote>It’s not about methods. It’s not about disciplines or roles. It’s about making the Business money.</blockquote><p>That’s the only way research becomes indispensable. And if we fail to do that? We become expendable. And that’s <em>exactly</em> what’s happening now.</p><h3>The disciplinary distraction: UX vs. Market Research</h3><p>This article builds on my response to a recent discussion in the <a href=""https://mrxpros.com/"">Market Research Pros Google Group</a>.</p><p>The original post brought up the difference between Market Research and UX Research, and did a really good job at delineating the difference between the two in terms of focus and scope and method. I agreed with the post.</p><p>But after spending more time with Market Researchers in the past 5 years, and working with Marketing Legend, Jay Abraham, I started to see more commonalities than differences in our disciplines.</p><figure><img alt=""Josh LaMar and Jay Abraham"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uVdrJDSPf5oBqyrjqbqwIQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Josh LaMar and Jay Abraham</figcaption></figure><p>We are both trying to understand customers and position products/services to meet their needs, either through positioning (Market Research) or through Designing and building the product (UX Research). The goal is the same.</p><p>And yet, the inevitable turf war started coming up… &quot;I do this, you do that.&quot; or, &quot;This is my lane! You stay in your lane!&quot;</p><p>Meanwhile, the business keeps moving ahead and amidst rounds of layoffs, there's a truth that we're not acknowledging:</p><blockquote>Research is irrelevant if it doesn't serve the Business.</blockquote><h3>The methods distraction: Quant vs Qual</h3><p>As the conversation progressed, we got back to the tried and true Quant vs. Qual debate, this time, with the nuance that &quot;Market Research works mainly in Quant&quot; and &quot;UX Research works mainly in Qual.&quot; Maybe it does.</p><p><strong>And maybe, it doesn't actually matter at all.</strong> I've seen Quant-focused UX studies (like Jobs to be Done) and Qual-focused ethnographic Market Research studies (Ever notice that Marketing always have more budget than the product teams?).</p><p>Mixed methods researchers claim they can do both. And it’s true. We toggle between qual and quant to answer different questions as the need arises... But it's still missing the point.</p><p>Why does ownership of methods matter to practitioners? It doesn’t matter to your CEO, that’s for certain. The deeper question is: What decisions are we trying to inform? And who ultimately benefits?</p><blockquote>What actually matters? Making data-informed decisions<strong> </strong>that fuel business outcomes.</blockquote><p>The reality is that researchers are not just out there gathering data that we present as insights and recommendations. We influence decisions about the product. And in today’s economic landscape, every decision that matters is, ultimately, a <em>business</em> decision.</p><h3>Product decisions are business decisions</h3><p>This point deserves its own section… The question came up next as to how to define &quot;Research.&quot; Ok, here's my attempt:</p><blockquote><em>Research (Both UX and Market Research) is</em> <em>the process</em> <em>of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting Customer and Product data to make Business decisions.</em></blockquote><p>This triad (Customer, Product, Business), comes together in <em>Product Truth</em>. It’s the intersection between what customers need your product to do, what you promise it does, and what it actually delivers.</p><figure><img alt=""Venn diagram of product truth showing the intersections of Business, Product, and Customer"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*f4OjHPoamhImzyLjmUc1sw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>When there is alignment between these three: Great! You're on the path to success. But when there's a breakdown… Watch out!</p><p>When you build products using only one or two of the lenses, you risk making flawed decisions:</p><ul><li>Business + Product (without Customer): Leads to commercially viable but irrelevant products.</li><li>Business + Customer (without Product): Creates desirable but unfeasible solutions.</li><li>Product + Customer (without Business): Results in great UX with no path to profitability.</li></ul><p>Misalignment can lead to product failure. But Research plays a unique role: it illuminates the missing perspectives, allowing insights to become a bridge into business strategy.</p><h3>Tough love</h3><p>If I could go back in time, I wouldn’t tell my younger self to learn another methodology or get better at stakeholder management.</p><blockquote>If I could go back in time, I’d give myself one piece of advice: “Care more about the business.”</blockquote><p>I used to think my job was to advocate for the user. And while that’s still true, but it’s a smaller part of the equation than I thought. Advocating for users without understanding the business context is like drawing a map without knowing where your destination is.</p><h3>Want to become essential?</h3><p>I think we all want to be seen as essential to the business… to grow in our careers, to thrive, and to make more money ourselves.

There’s a big difference between giving a gift and <em>really</em> giving a gift. We all know the feeling: something bought quickly just to check a box versus something chosen because it feels like the person it’s meant for. That intentional, personalized spark is exactly what creator <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/alexa.lumley/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Alexa Lumley</a> looks for — and exactly why <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Etsy</a> has become her go-to for discovering gifts that feel thoughtful, meaningful, and deeply personal.<br /> <br />For Lumley, shopping on Etsy isn’t a routine scroll — it’s a moment of connection. “What draws me to Etsy is the thrill of discovery,” she says. “I never feel like I’m just shopping; I feel like I’m getting a peek into someone’s passion — their craft, their story, their point of view.”<br /><br />That look into a maker’s world is what keeps her coming back. She’s drawn to pieces that feel thoughtful and personal — the kind of gift that feels like it was meant for someone in particular. “There’s something so satisfying about finding a piece you didn’t expect, but instantly know it’s the one.”<br /><br />When she’s in gifting mode, Lumley approaches Etsy with equal parts intuition and strategy. She always starts with her “favorite shops” list, but she loves letting the platform lead her somewhere unexpected. Her number-one tip? Use the “similar items on Etsy” section at the bottom of every listing. “Some of my absolute favorite pieces have come from scrolling there,” she says. “The less rigid I am, the better the finds.” It’s her secret to uncovering gifts she never could’ve searched for directly — especially the ones that end up meaning the most.<br /><br />That gift-driven mindset came through clearly when Lumley recently chose presents for her loved ones this holiday: a <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/listing/4325425131/beige-knit-sweater-women-chunky-ribbed?click_key=01f6a6ef50347b8ea87a031af0bf0051%3ALTb705faea2f8f2c1ee9dbd8d3158b1f7437eff5fe&amp;click_sum=4c05e97b&amp;ls=r&amp;ref=rlp-listing-grid-1&amp;external=1&amp;sr_prefetch=0&amp;pf_from=rlp&amp;sts=1&amp;content_source=01f6a6ef50347b8ea87a031af0bf0051%253ALTb705faea2f8f2c1ee9dbd8d3158b1f7437eff5fe"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">luxuriously cozy handmade sweater</a> for her mother, an incredible <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/listing/984862301/rustic-christmas-natural-linen?click_key=01f6a6ef50347b8ea87a031af0bf0051%3ALT6983f6892946084e2e7d8ffdca22b905748dfa2c&amp;click_sum=ce78f421&amp;ls=r&amp;ref=rlp-listing-grid-2&amp;external=1&amp;sr_prefetch=0&amp;pf_from=rlp&amp;pro=1&amp;frs=1&amp;sts=1&amp;content_source=01f6a6ef50347b8ea87a031af0bf0051%253ALT6983f6892946084e2e7d8ffdca22b905748dfa2c"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">linen tablecloth</a> for her sister, and a <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.etsy.com/listing/4352700156/handmade-ceramic-spoon-rest-fun-kitchen?click_key%3D01f6a6ef50347b8ea87a031af0bf0051%253ALTfde57492dfa563d42fa87dd6a8600a5da2259f78%26click_sum%3Db06969d3%26ls%3Dr%26ref%3Drlp-listing-grid-3%26external%3D1%26sr_prefetch%3D0%26pf_from%3Drlp%26frs%3D1%26content_source%3D01f6a6ef50347b8ea87a031af0bf0051%25253ALTfde57492dfa563d42fa87dd6a8600a5da2259f78&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1765387408517031&amp;usg=AOvVaw2BGAktedaR7EPU9k0YwrIS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">handmade ceramic spoon rest</a> painted with 'Mediocre Chef'— a cheeky little nod that instantly reminded her of her best friend. ""It was exactly her sense of humor,"" she says. They’re the kinds of gifts that make people say, <em>Wait, where did you find this?</em> — which, for Lumley, is the whole point.<br /><br />Her gifting philosophy mirrors her approach to personal style. “I’m a very visual person,” she explains. Thoughtful photography and cohesive styling help her understand a maker’s intention — something she values deeply when choosing pieces for others. And when she’s unsure, she returns to the mood boards she builds for herself. “If a piece fits the overall vibe, I know I’ll love it long-term. If it doesn’t, it’s usually a reminder that I’m looking at an impulse buy.”<br /><br />Still, her favorite finds are always the unexpected ones, like a recent discovery — a <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/listing/1657422074/baguette-candle-4-wick-beeswax-bread?click_key=c6c50d4b0a1eea25c6109b17be9ec371%3ALT9131757c33e1800154f1f2ed718845f902a7836d&amp;click_sum=a1a8311c&amp;ls=r&amp;ref=rlp-listing-grid-25&amp;external=1&amp;sr_prefetch=0&amp;pf_from=rlp&amp;frs=1&amp;sts=1&amp;content_source=c6c50d4b0a1eea25c6109b17be9ec371%253ALT9131757c33e1800154f1f2ed718845f902a7836d"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">baguette candle</a> so realistic it made her think of a friend who loves to host dinner parties as much as she loves good food.<br /><br />This Etsy magic is what keeps Lumley returning to the platform for gifting again and again: it bridges the gap between wanting to give something nice and wanting to give something thoughtful. It’s where craft becomes connection and discoverability is mixed with soul. “When a piece feels so specific to someone you love, it makes the discovery feel even more special.”<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSAeag3kdaU/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA=="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Watch her video</a> to explore the personalized Etsy gifts she chose for the people she loves.<figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948354.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><h2>Handmade Ceramic Spoon Rest</h2><br />For the home cook whose kitchen tells a story—splattered sauces, big laughs, and all.

</div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11945554.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Every January, I set big intentions: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tal-hydration-water-bottle-review"">drink twice as much water</a>, hit <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/03/11866324/the-girls-spot-womens-only-gym-trans-women-ban-backlash"">the gym</a>, and see my friends more. Without fail, life usually gets in the way, and most fizzle out, but one rule I always stick to is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/skincare-products-you-dont-need"">taking good care of my skin</a>. </p>



<p>As a beauty director, I know too many dermatologists <em>not</em> to. (Yes, I’ve been scolded for not removing my makeup properly — it’s a little embarrassing.) But making — and keeping — skincare resolutions doesn’t have to feel like a chore. Often, even small changes can build the foundation for skin you’re happy with.</p>



<p>Ahead, I asked a top dermatologist for their practical skincare resolutions for 2026. Believe me — these are goals you’ll actually want to follow in January and beyond.</p>



<h2>Skip the ‘good vs. bad’ ingredient apps</h2>



<p>There’s no shortage of apps and websites that screen skincare ingredients and label them “safe” or “unsafe” for your skin — but dermatologist <a href=""https://drophelia.com/?srsltid=AfmBOor1SZ0zAioqHnSNhEuCEpxXtxjuHiSp-ltwTen9UrhqlRGBraRo"">Dr. Ophelia Veraitch</a> isn’t convinced. “I haven’t found the apps to help screen ingredients very accurate,” says Dr. Veraitch. </p>



<p>Instead, she recommends that patients prone to unexplained irritation or sensitivity cross-check their products against an allergy list. The <a href=""https://dermnetnz.org/topics/baseline-series-of-patch-test-allergens"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">North American Baseline Series</a> — often used by dermatologists — is a standard list of allergens most commonly known to cause contact dermatitis, meaning skin irritation like redness or dry, cracked skin caused by direct contact with an allergen. If your skin doesn’t react to your skincare or cosmetics, there’s generally little need to cross-check.</p>



<h2>Supercharge sunscreen with these key ingredients</h2>



<p>If you’re an R29 regular, this might sound obvious: “<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-sunscreen-spf-oily-skin"">Daily, year-round sunscreen</a> is the single most impactful habit for preventing premature aging and reducing the risk of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mole-mapping-experience-melanoma"">skin cancers</a>,” says Dr. Veraitch, who recommends a high-factor (SPF 30–50), <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wearing-sunscreen-spf-daily-affordable"">broad-spectrum facial sunscreen</a>. But if you really want to maximize its protective benefits, consider layering a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-vitamin-c-serum"">vitamin C</a> or vitamin E serum underneath. “Both ingredients help neutralize free-radical damage,” says Dr. Veraitch, basically things like pollution and UV rays. “They also support collagen,” she adds, which keeps skin supple.</p>



<p>Opt for a gentle vitamin C serum like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fmulti-antioxidant-radiance-serum-with-vitamin-c-P516231%3F"">The Ordinary’s Multi-Antioxidant Radiance Serum with Vitamin C and Ginseng</a>, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2F12-pure-vitamin-c-anti-aging-face-serum-pimprod2012322%3Fsku%3D2556946"">La Roche-Posay 12% Pure Vitamin C Anti-Aging Face Serum</a>. If you tend to have dry, easily irritated skin, vitamin E is naturally more moisturizing and can help protect your skin barrier — the outermost layer that keeps good stuff in (like moisture) and bad stuff out (like bacteria). Try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fsuper-serum-5-in-1-renewing-face-serum-pimprod2041031%3Fsku%3D2615445"">Olay Super Serum 5-in-1 Renewing Face Serum</a>.</p>





<h2>Try tranexamic acid for hyperpigmentation</h2>



<p>From vitamin C to glycolic acid, there are a handful of ingredients dermatologists recommend <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/07/11453847/hyperpigmentation-scale-dark-skin-esthetician-advice"">for hyperpigmentation</a>, often caused by acne, superficial burns, or too much sun exposure. But according to Dr. Veraitch, there’s nothing quite like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/10/11131505/melasma-treatments-dermatologist-shereene-idriss"">tranexamic acid</a>.</p>



<p>“Tranexamic acid is one of the most effective and underutilized ingredients for treating pigmentation,” she says. “What’s more, it helps calm inflammation and targets pathways involved in melasma [a skin condition that causes gray or brown patches], post-inflammatory marks, and uneven skin tone.”</p>



<p>Dr. Veraitch adds that she doesn’t like to chase buzzy new ingredients. Instead, she prefers to see solid data and real-world experience before recommending something to her patients — and there’s <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4235096/"">plenty of research</a> ruling in tranexamic acid’s favor for treating pigmentation.</p>

There’s also <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Ftranexamic-topical-acid-5-pimprod2045655%3Fsku%3D2627359"">Naturium’s Tranexamic Topical Acid 5%</a>, formulated with tranexamic acid, niacinamide, and kojic acid to even out skin tone, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Finnbeauty-project-retinol-remix-1-retinol-treatment-with-peptide-tranexamic-acid-P483127%3F"">INNBeauty Project Retinol Remix 1% Retinol Treatment</a>, with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/rhode-peptide-eye-prep-review"">skin-strengthening peptides</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"">cell-rejuvenating retinol</a>.</p>





<h2>Make mindful drinking part of your skincare goals</h2>



<p>“Alcohol can really exacerbate inflammatory skin conditions such as acne <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sex-trigger-rosacea-flare-up"">and rosacea</a>,” says Dr. Veraitch, who believes January is the perfect time to consider “cutting back and rebalancing the skin” after the festive season. In fact, prioritizing overall wellbeing throughout the year — whether managing stress, exercising more, or seeking help for sleeplessness — is always her top tip. “General health plays a huge role in skin and hair quality,” she emphasizes.</p>



<h2>Where you spray perfume makes all the difference</h2>



<p>If you have sensitive or reactive skin, Dr. Veraitch recommends rethinking where you spray your perfumes and body mists. “Spraying perfume directly onto the skin can trigger contact allergies and make people sensitive to many fragranced skincare products,” says Dr. Veraitch, who has seen this firsthand in her clinic. She adds that perfume is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/perfume-fragrance-hormonal-effects"">absolutely fine and safe to use</a>, but those with sensitivities may do better applying it to clothing rather than directly onto their skin. Fragrance tends to last a lot longer on clothes, anyway. </p>



<h2>Targeted skincare beats blanket injectables</h2>



<p>Dr. Veraitch says many patients book injectables <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/injectable-lip-balm-filler"">like filler</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/preventative-botox-wrinkles-scam-myth"">Botox</a> without first making sure their skin is at its healthiest — think a strong <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-is-skin-barrier-damage-fix"">skin barrier,</a> with minimal irritation. Of course, R29 is a judgment-free zone when it comes to treatments, but if you <em>are</em> considering injectables, Dr. Veraitch advises seeing a dermatologist for a targeted treatment plan first: “Clear, healthy skin means you’re not constantly ‘chasing’ signs of aging with fillers,” she says. A dermatologist, facialist, or esthetician can help you build a skincare plan that suits your budget.</p>



<h2>Consider making laser part of your skincare plan</h2>



<p>If your skincare budget extends to treatments in 2026, Dr. Veraitch can’t speak more highly of Fraxel Dual, a non-ablative laser she says improves skin texture, pigmentation, and overall radiance in a long-lasting way. “It’s one of the most effective ways I’ve seen to ‘reset’ the skin,” says Dr. Veraitch, who regularly recommends the treatment to her patients.</p>



<p>And it’s not just cosmetic. “Recent data from Harvard dermatologists has shown that patients who get Fraxel Dual once a year have a 50% <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36728065/"">reduced risk of developing non-melanoma</a> skin cancers,” she adds. That said, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-uv-filters-spf-45-sunscreen"">wearing sunscreen</a> and limiting your time in the sun is just as effective — and remains a top dermatologist recommendation. There’s no need to spend a small fortune, either. “People often believe that the more expensive the product, the better the results — but that’s rarely true,” says Dr. Veraitch. “Using the right and good quality actives, plus a decent SPF for your skin, matters far more than price.”</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948030.jpg?resize=150%2C150"" /><figcaption>Digital image creation of the Mars planet.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>After <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">months of planetary retrogrades</a>, we are finally regaining our energy. For the first time since the start of 2024, Mars is shining boldly in Capricorn, giving us the enthusiasm to move forward. This is the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/december-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">cosmic glow-up</a> we’ve been waiting for! Now, we can move into the new year with a more refined and ardent mindset. So, set your calendar for December 15th to feel the energetic shift. </p>



<p>Mars in Capricorn is a powerful placement for the action planet. Capricorn is a cardinal sign that likes to get things done and won’t stop until it achieves its goal. When Mars and Capricorn collide, it utilizes strategy and ambition to achieve its goals. During this transit, we focus on the long-term agenda rather than short-term plans, ensuring that our goals come to fruition through planning and discipline. We can succeed at whatever we put our mind to, as long as our visions are well thought out and leave no room for error.</p>



<p>Surely, you must be aware that Mars in Capricorn brings out our <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/women-high-libido"">highest sex drives</a>? However, we aren’t ones to look for frills or fancy lovemaking; instead, we often prefer a straightforward approach to hooking up (Mars in Capricorn works and plays hard at the office and in the bedroom). But we tend to lean into the simple pleasures of life. Capricorn is an earth sign that likes decadence just as much as its cohorts; the sea goat doesn’t kiss and tell and keeps it low-key. </p>



<p>It’s important to note that Mars in Capricorn can take matters to the extreme after being pushed to the edge, which doesn’t take much. The slightest criticism can stir the pot. However, this placement doesn’t necessarily want to engage in arguments — a chill lifestyle is essential. Once they reach a feverish pitch, they will be relentless in proving their points and won’t stop until the other person gives up. Basically, Mars in Capricorn isn’t about to wave a white flag in the air; they’ll keep it going until an authentic apology is given.</p>



<p>We may be a little pushy and want to expedite matters because we want them to happen at top speed. It’s great to be excited about relationships, as we want to fulfill our aspirations in every area of our lives; however, we must respect other people’s boundaries. Although Mars in Capricorn is very compliant to their needs, this placement can be a little aggressive and force us to ignore limits that are set in partnerships.</p>



<p>All in all, Mars in Capricorn is a glorious time to expand our horizons, as long as we don’t hold back. By aligning with the cosmic forces at play, we can flourish and bring our dreams to life. Most importantly, take this time as an opportunity to prioritize self-care and do something great for yourself. Give yourself TLC!</p>

<p>What comes to mind when you think of winter? For some, it’s glittery parties, for others, maybe it’s après ski. For all, no matter where you <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/december-2025-tarotscopes-2026-tatianna-tarot"">close out the year</a> — and welcome a new one — we hope it’s a well-deserved rest and a fresh start <em>in style</em>. Here’s where the latest edition of the R29 Lookbook comes in. <br /><br />We gave three industry-leading creatives across styling, makeup, and nails the ultimate task: Dream up five unforgettable winter looks that capture everything the most magical time of year has to offer: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-makeup-looks"">Holiday parties</a>, snowy getaways, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-matching-sweatsuits-womens"">cozy nights in</a>, Valentine’s Day dinners, and everything in between. <br /><br />For glam, we tapped celebrity makeup artist and founder of KJH.brand, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/katiejanehughes/?hl=en"">Katie Jane Hughes</a>. Fresh off a global tour with Dua Lipa, Hughes applied her refreshingly real (read: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-products-at-home-manicure-diy-kit"">Endlessly DIY-able</a>) approach to editorial beauty. Then there’s nail artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/naominailsnyc/?hl=en"">Naomi Yasuda</a>, who counts Gigi Hadid, Sabrina Carpenter, and Madonna among her most notable clients. Last, but not least, rounding out our dream team roster is fashion stylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/christinenicholson__/?hl=en"">Christine Nicholson</a>, whose work has graced magazines, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nyfw-spring-summer-2026-soccer-sport-fashion-trend"">runways</a>, and now Refinery29.<br /><br />So go ahead and unwrap our gift to you this season: The <strong><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-2026-fashion-beauty-lookbook"">Winter 2026 R29 Lookbook</a></strong> — and tips on how you can recreate each vibe. </p>

<h2>The Weather-Maxxer</h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948102.jpg?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948103.jpg?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>The classic <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hm-perfect-moment-collaboration"">après-ski aesthetic</a> will never go out of style, but it can always be refreshed for everyday wear. Stylist Christine Nicholson says the Snowed Under look is “who I would want to be on any given day,” and adds that it was inspired by “skiing in the Alps, vintage Chanel ads, and <a href=""https://www.therealreal.com/designers/courreges"">vintage Courrèges</a>.” But it’s reimagined so that you can channel a ski resort vacationer even if you live far from the slopes. That means reaching for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-balaclavas-bonnets-knitted-hooded-scarf"">hooded scarves</a>, slip skirts, and Moon Boots rather than actual ski apparel. <br /><br />Instead of icy, frosty tones, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/katie-jane-hughes-naked-beauty-interview"">makeup artist Katie Jane Hughes</a> interpreted the theme through healthy, glowing skin, softly sculpted lids and cheekbones, and, most notably, a delicate smattering of rhinestone freckles applied individually. Meanwhile, nail artist Naomi Yasuda remixed the classic <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/deep-french-tips-nails-manicure-trend"">French manicure</a> with 3D textured tips reminiscent of frozen geodomes. An elongated, squared shape adds old-school glam.<br /><br /><strong>Get the look: </strong>“I think to pull any ski look together, you need a really great hat or snood, and a fantastic pair of goggles or eyewear,” says Nicholson. She also highlights “ribbed leggings — knit, preferably cashmere or merino wool,” as a winter wardrobe staple, and suggests adding a statement scarf to look stylish without sacrificing warmth. “I think you can guarantee warmth and functionality wearing a scarf, and you can still always turn out <em>a look</em>.” </p>

<h2>The Festive Guest</h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948105.jpg?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948106.jpg?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>This one’s for the party girls. Inspired by the New Year’s Eve ball drop, this look is meant for celebrating with your besties on nights out. “I think New York is such a special [place] right now, and we’ve had a hard year. So celebration looks and moments are where I’m at,” explains Nicholson. Your look doesn’t have to be a stereotypical sequin mini dress, nor does your holiday soirée glam need to take hours to achieve. Allow us to present the following: Brushed-up brows, a kissable cocoa lip, and rose-gold eyeshadow — best found under the mistletoe.<br /><br /><strong>Get the look:</strong> This sparking look can be achieved by mixing high and low pieces, like pairing a statement chainmail top with your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/denim-trends-2025"">favorite baggy jeans</a>. Nicholson adds: “Whether it’s real diamonds or Swarovski crystals or cubic zirconia, anyone can make a really simple look dazzle.” Unexpected accessories like peek-a-boo bralettes and arm cuffs can also make an outfit more interesting and special. </p>







<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>The Errand Runner</h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948112.jpg?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948113.jpg?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>The girls who get it, get it: Throw on a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cardigan-sweaters"">cozy cardigan</a>, pick up a matcha, and head to hot yoga. This dreamy, layered look — inspired by “girls’ winter trips to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pilates-yoga-men-women-class-etiquette"">Pilates</a>,” according to Nicholson — is the ultimate athleisure ‘fit. Here, fresh (but never sweaty) skin and a monochromatic wash of color across lids, lips, and cheeks mimics the look of a post-workout flush.<br /><br /><strong>Get the look: </strong>Whether you’re actually taking a barre class or having friends over for hot chocolate, layer up your tops and bottoms for a ballerina aesthetic. “Anyone can get a pair of leggings or colored tights, whether they want to wear them with the full foot or ankle cutouts,” Nicholson suggests. A pair of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-ballet-flats"">ballerina flats</a> will always be the sweetest finishing touch. </p>







<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>The Demuralist</h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948109.jpg?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948110.jpg?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>The Roaring Twenties have been reimagined with this modern flapper moment for those who love to show up and show out. “We wanted to lean into this idea of the ‘20s and that being a reference point for celebration and holiday,” says Nicholson. “We kept the idea of craftsmanship as it relates to things like beading, but made it feel new and fresh.” Glossy, gasoline-like lids replace the traditional going-out smoky eye for a sultry effect that feels positively modern. Sculpted cheekbones and contoured lips are the coolest supporting actors. <br /><br /><strong>Get the look: </strong>When putting together a late-night look, consider deep palettes and lots of sparkle. Nicholson’s only note is to reach for “beaded anything.” Opt for a flapper-esque dress that has a drop waist or is knee-length, and modernize it by wearing it over a pair of chic culottes. And no, you shouldn’t shy away from headwear. Rather than a kitschy feather headpiece, consider a dramatic headband or oversized bow barrette.</p>







<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>The Holiday Host</h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948053.jpg?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948054.jpg?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Whether you’re <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-housewarming-home-gifts"">hosting a holiday dinner</a>, attending your office party, or watching a performance of <em>The Nutcracker</em>, you should feel elevated and festive for all of your RSVPs. Nicholson cites “a really fabulous person at an office party” and the idea of elevating more professional attire. This tone-on-tone look — which pops thanks to all the texture — is the vibe we’re going for this season. For beauty, lit-from-within skin meets a soft wash of shimmery teal across the eyes for a result that feels refreshing and unexpected in a sea of frosty, icy makeup.<br /><strong><br />Get the look: </strong>You can almost always ensure you look chic and effortlessly put-together in monochrome, especially in snowy whites — like Pantone’s 2026 Color of the Year: <a href=""https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year/2026"">Cloud Dancer</a>. Consider playing with textures across each piece of your outfit for a festive touch. Nicholson suggests investing in a cropped, shaggy, faux fur jacket to easily recreate the look.</p>

<p>Winter is the season to create your own joy.<br /><br />The light dims, the temperatures drop, and suddenly the world asks you to become your own source of warmth. But joy in winter isn’t found — it’s self-initiated. It’s the glitter you swipe on for an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-makeup-looks"">office party</a>, the text inviting friends over when the instinct is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-matching-sweatsuits-womens"">to hibernate</a>, the little <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-nail-manicure-trends-2025"">acts of glamour</a> that lift your mood when the sun clocks out early.<br /><br />Although I live in sunny Los Angeles now — and this will be my third winter here — the New Yorker in me will never forget what the season truly feels like. I know the sharp bite of wind on your face, the sprint to the subway in a full-length puffer, the way a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/womens-fall-jackets"">great coat</a> can change your entire outlook on a day that feels impossibly gray. Winter requires resourcefulness. It asks you to participate in your own delight.<br /><br />For this year’s <strong><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-2026-fashion-beauty-lookbook"">Winter Lookbook</a></strong>, we embraced that ethos and dreamed up five archetypes, each embodying a different response to the season: the woman who refuses to be cold yet refuses to look bad, the early-morning studio devotee, the holiday enthusiast, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-housewarming-home-gifts"">effortless hostess</a>, and the one who transforms entirely after dark. They each dress for the mood they want, not the weather outside; they layer textures, play with proportion, embrace metallics, and create their own glow in the darkest months.</p>

<p>To bring this world to life, we partnered with three extraordinary artists:<br /><br />Stylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/christinenicholson__/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Christine Nicholson</a> built a visual universe where winter dressing becomes totally reimagined. Think silver chainmail draped over soft knits, feathered headpieces that nod to another era, and sculptural accessories that redefine cold-weather glamour.<br /><br />Makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/katiejanehughes/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Katie Jane Hughes</a> reimagined holiday beauty with cool restraint. She showed us that luminosity doesn’t require heavy layers; sometimes, a shimmery lip and nearly bare skin is the boldest statement. Her rhinestone freckles for our Weather-Maxxer look were nothing short of magical.<br /><br />Nail artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/naominailsnyc/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Naomi Yasuda</a> elevated winter manicures to high art, crafting everything from delicate reverse French designs to full-on disco-metallic sets that feel like jewelry in their own right.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948629.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>

<p>And beyond the holiday parties, there is the quintessence of winter dressing: New Year’s Eve. It’s a night I take seriously: the ritual of it, the intention behind it, the desire to enter the new year as the fullest, most expressive version of yourself.<br /><br />As you scroll, you’ll also find guides to braving the cold with style, ideas for hosting in chic winter whites, new ways to think about your nails and makeup this season, and fashion that helps you generate your own joy, no matter the temperature.<br /><br />Because winter doesn’t hand you delight — you have to make it — and this season, we hope these images inspire you to create more of it.</p>

<p>This year hasn’t exactly left us lacking in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ghost-layers-waves-haircut-trend"">haircut trends</a>. In August, we fell for the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/thickening-haircut-fine-thin-hair"">“thickening” cut</a> — a strategically <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/feathered-butterfly-haircut-trend"">layered style</a> that adds major volume to fine strands — and in November, we spotted the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/j-shape-haircut-trend"">J-shape haircut</a>, with its <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/concave-layers-hair-trend"">loose layers</a> that fall effortlessly into that curved silhouette. But with a shiny new year on the horizon, a fresh wave of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/paris-fashion-week-haircut-trends-spring-summer-2026"">haircut ideas</a> is on the way.</p>



<p>Whether you’re eyeing the “cloud” bob or craving something shorter, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/01/11843952/pixie-haircut-trends-2025"">like a pixie crop</a>, there’s a trend for everyone.</p>



<p>Ahead, top hairstylists from London to NYC share the cuts set to define 2026 — and beyond.</p>

<p>Hair artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tomsmithhd/?hl=en"">Tom Smith</a> describes the varsity bob as a choppy, chin-skimming cut with subtle layers and a center part. The inspo? <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stxph.h/?hl=en"">Steph Hui</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/milliebobbybrown/?hl=en"">Millie Bobby Brown</a>. “Polished but never prissy, it carries a cool collegiate energy — youthful without being childish and preppy without being stiff,” says Smith. While the movement might look undone, it’s actually intentional and well-maintained, adds Smith, thanks to the invisible layers through the mid-lengths and ends that create that flicky volume.</p>

<p>“Gucci bangs feel very fashion-forward — and powerful,” says celebrity hairstylist and colorist, Dimitris Giannetos. He recalls creating the softly-parted, slightly grown-out look for <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPCbqhRCcFf/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Demi Moore</a> ahead of her role as the fictional character Barbara Gucci in the short film <a href=""https://www.gucci.com/uk/en_gb/ms/short-film/video/?srsltid=AfmBOoqmlK5X6LGynFA07QzQ_cV-MEN9asH5aMoAgw1q-0w5QmEfs8ve""><em>The Tiger</em></a><em>.</em> “To achieve this look, ask for wispy curtain bangs just below the brows with face-framing pieces towards the ears,” recommends Giannetos. The key? “Avoid a blunt cut by adding some variety to the length of the bangs across the face,” he says.</p>

<p>“<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRwqKtLkWkX/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Anok Yai</a>’s striking short bob, complete with a blunt fringe, highlights the boldness of this style,” says celebrity hairdresser <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lorraine_dublin/?hl=en"">Lorraine Dublin</a>. “It’s a sharp, chin-skimming bob paired with a clean fringe, and it’s set to stand out this winter.” Why? It has a strong, modern silhouette, Dublin explains, yet still feels polished and low-maintenance. We also love the look on content creator <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/C5grHtioEd-/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Deborah Iona</a>.</p>

The ripped bob, however, is a more interesting, layered take, thanks to softly separated ends created with a texturizing technique where the hair is chopped into vertically.

<p>The shag is set to take on a much gentler image in 2026, according to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/neale.rodger/?hl=en"">Neale Roger</a>, style director at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stil.salon/reels/?hl=en"">STIL salon</a> in London. “Think soft, feathered layers that build volume and create easy movement,” says Roger, like this look by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DQ8UfaOEZwa/?hl=en"">Ryenne Snow</a>. Roger adds that it’s the kind of cut that still looks intentional even as it grows out. “It’s a brilliant choice for medium to thick hair,” continues Roger, “especially if there’s already some natural wave or texture to play with.” Guiding your stylist is simple: “Ask for feathered layers throughout, soft ends, and a length that sits somewhere between the neck and shoulders,” advises Roger.</p>

<p>The ’70s have had their time in the sun. Now, it’s 1960’s time to shine, and bangs are leading the resurgence, says <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/rickyandthe64/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ricky Walters</a>, founder and creative director of <a href=""https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/kDPwCAD7OkS1gz3BSGfnFGBjS0?domain=instagram.com"">Salon 64</a>. “The new incarnation is all about boldness: think thick, heavy, statement-making fringes taken surprisingly far back into the crown,” says Walters. He adds, “This isn’t a whisper of a fringe; it’s a full-volume curtain that instantly reshapes the face, adding drama, mystery, and a touch of French-girl rebellion.” Walters says that cutting it with plenty of density — adding bulk through techniques like point cutting and texturizing — prevents it from slipping into anything too dated. Hairstylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRgiqAzkYj5/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Ryenne Snow</a> always nails it.</p>

<p>The power pixie has <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DKC7SdkIV8j/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Florence Pugh</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/glennclose/?hl=en"">Glenn Close</a>, and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lirisaw/?hl=en"">Iris Law</a> to thank for its meteoric rise. “This is a cropped, layered pixie that’s sharp, sculpted, and deliberately androgynous,” says Smith. Its key characteristics? “Enough length and the top and front to allow for versatile styling,” adds Smith, who calls it the ultimate anti-blowout style. “This is great for finer hair types and those who want more lift, as it helps to contour the jawline and cheekbones when long enough to be tucked behind the ears,” says Smith. Asking for it couldn’t be simpler: “Ask for close layering and texture that can shift from matte and punkish by day to polished and glossy at night,” advises Smith — and don’t forget the longer, swooping bangs.</p>

<p>The name sounds complicated, but the result speaks for itself. It’s essentially a soft blowout with rounded, bouncy ends, explains Giannetos, who recently debuted the look on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPfNBxrAm_i/?img_index=1"">Amal Clooney</a>. “It works well on long, layered hair, about 6-8 inches from the shoulder. This look enhances body, adds movement, and makes the blowout feel thicker and more voluminous,” says Giannetos. “I like to take a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbioionic.com%2Fproducts%2Flong-barrel-curling-iron%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOop4ikEqvaTUTaxG4jDAYCjJnatn52afqSSXogJ4hCj1l_BzoThO"">1.25” Bio Ionic Curler</a> to the ends to lock in the rounded shape.”</p>

<p>The shaggy bob is not only effortlessly chic, says Dublin, but it’s practical for winter and spring. “The layers add movement and texture — great under scarves or hats — while still looking polished for work or evening plans,” adds Dublin. Grab a hydrating hair cream like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fpalo-santo-styling-cream-for-curly-coily-hair-P514454"">PATTERN by Tracee Ellis Ross Palo Santo Styling Cream</a> and let your natural texture do its thing.

<p>Mussed-up texture is in this season, says Stenson, and while the classic shag’s layering technique is making a comeback, it’s being reimagined for 2026 with modern softness and volume. “Even better, it’s flexible across hair types,” he adds. “A shag is great for anyone with thick hair because it removes weight and bulk. If you have finer hair, ask for a modern micro-shag or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/07/10604094/wolf-cut-hair-style"">wolf-shag</a> with strategic layering that adds volume and texture without making the hair look sparse,” advises Stenson. This <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/Cs24C3GoX3u/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">cut on Linasha</a> never fails to inspire. </p>

<p>“The textured lob [aka long bob] will continue its quiet takeover,” says Roger. “It’s mid-length, slightly undone, and effortlessly cool — the kind of cut that behaves beautifully through winter,” he adds. It’s also a seasonal all-rounder, and easy to air-dry in the warmer months, too. “I love how it slips under scarves and coats without losing shape, and it gives hair that natural, lived-in movement,” continues Roger, who says it’s perfect for wavy and lightly curly hair. “Ask your stylist for a neck-to-shoulder graze with feathered, textured ends, and a soft, natural finish,” suggests Roger. Hairstylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DNdc8ajudld/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Catherine Gibbs</a> nails the look here.</p>

<p>The 2026 update is lighter than its previous counterpart, says Walters, and it sits in what he refers to as the magic zone: “Just above the collarbone and never shorter than the jawline,” adds Walters, like this cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DL7RI9nTj3h/?img_index=1"">Miho Mai</a>. “This sweet spot creates a clean, graphic silhouette without sacrificing softness.” What gives it a modern edge is the invisible layering: “These are subtle, sliced-in shorter pieces hidden underneath,” says Walters. “These secret layers act like built-in movement, allowing the bob to swing, breathe, and catch the light in all the right ways.”</p>

<p>If they’re not cut properly, curtain bangs can look blocky and unnatural, failing to blend into the rest of your lengths. That’s why Stenson suggests asking for “texturized” curtain bangs. Texturized bangs are cut with techniques that soften the fringe and remove bulk, so they fall more naturally. “Your stylist will assess the density of your hair to ensure your bangs are proportionate to your face,” says Stenson. “Bangs are especially a great choice for those with fine or thin hair and looking to bring some volume to their look. They’re truly versatile enough to suit all face shapes.” Take inspiration from this cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DHXGOA8RxGH/?hl=en"">@charlottexstyles</a> on Instagram.</p>

<p>The bixie — bob meets pixie — is heading into 2026 with us, and for good reason: it’s soft, wearable, and short enough to feel fresh, says Roger. “This is a sweet spot between a bob and a pixie, and it’s ideal for anyone tempted to go shorter without committing to a full pixie,” says Roger. He adds that it works especially well on fine to medium hair, which always benefits from added texture through the mid-lengths and ends. “When you’re asking for it in the chair, think chin length or slightly above, with light, choppy layers and a soft, airy finish.” We love this crop by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DKmqHaSxsQ2/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Chellsie Aiger Serrano</a>.</p>

<p>Roger is convinced that a “clean, blunt bob” is the answer to feeling polished without the effort, like this cut on STIL client <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DJcGcLqIu_E/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Abbie de Fontaine</a>. “The strong, even line gives you instant structure,” he says. “Plus, it looks incredible peeking out from under winter and spring layers.” He adds that the cut is particularly beautiful on slightly wavy or straight, finer hair, as it lends weight and sharpness. For the best result, Roger suggests asking for a chin-to-collarbone bob with crisp, blunt ends and minimal layering. “Keep it sleek or lightly textured depending on your hair type,” he says.</p>
