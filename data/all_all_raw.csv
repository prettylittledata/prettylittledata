The discipline of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/structural-engineering"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">engineering</a> related to buildings is referred to as <em>statics</em>.

The design brief calls for the transformation of this cubic building into a garment design office capable of accommodating approximately 100 occupants. The high occupancy density, combined with the inherently strong functional attributes of the office typology, introduces a pronounced sense of spatial density to the site.

New owners of a corner house—a couple with backgrounds in marketing and journalism, raising two children—came to ABA for something ""clean, bright, natural, highly purposeful/functional, and kid-friendly."" While the exterior of the building is protected by landmark status, ABA approached the interiors not as restoration, but as reinvention. Looking to retain character while minimizing complexity, ABA suggested unifying spaces and bringing calm and simplicity by using as few ingredients as possible, consistently throughout. In doing so, the design process simultaneously references the house's historic form, borrows from early modernists like Adolph Loos in material usage, and unapologetically eliminates detail.</p>",

<h4>Most AI features fail because they start with hype, not humans.</h4><figure><img alt=""Blurred office scene with a humanoid robot seated across from a man at a desk. Overlaid headline reads, “Why Most AI Products Fail Before the First User Interaction,” with a visible “Save This” button."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JUhjp2-rcUq3oOaZl9Vt4g.png"" /><figcaption>Image Credit: AI Generated Image</figcaption></figure><p>Most AI products fail before the first user interaction because they don’t solve a real user problem. That may sound dramatic, but I keep hearing the same sentence in executive rooms: “We need an AI feature. Our competitor just launched one.” And just like that, features are built out of fear of being left behind rather than from a clear understanding of what users actually need.</p><p>And this isn’t just my opinion. Recently, I came across a report titled <a href=""https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2680-1.html"">The Root Causes of Failure for Artificial Intelligence Projects and How They Can Succeed</a> by RAND.</p><p>The researchers interviewed 65 experienced data scientists and engineers who have spent years building AI and machine learning systems. Their goal was simple: understand why so many AI initiatives fail and what differentiates the few that succeed.</p><p>One of their core conclusions is striking. The most successful AI projects focus relentlessly on the problem they are meant to solve, not on the technology used to solve it. That sentence could have come straight out of an UX strategy deck.</p><p>Designers have been trained for decades to understand users and their problems before building solutions. What if AI projects are struggling not because of the models, but because design thinking was missing from the room?</p><h3>Building AI products for the mere sake of tech</h3><p>I see many companies building and releasing AI products because they feel they have to (often because their competitor just launched a tool with “AI” in the name), rather than because they’ve identified a real user need.</p><p>This appears to be a major trend, so it doesn’t surprise me to read what, for some, may be shocking statistics: Gartner predicts that <a href=""https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-06-25-gartner-predicts-over-40-percent-of-agentic-ai-projects-will-be-canceled-by-end-of-2027""><strong>more than 40% of agentic AI projects</strong></a> will be canceled by the end of 2027. The reasons for failure cited are escalating costs, unclear business value, and inadequate risk controls. Their own analyst called it out directly: most of these projects are early-stage experiments driven by hype and often misapplied.</p><p>Gartner also estimates that only about 130 of the thousands of agentic AI vendors out there offer genuine capabilities. The rest are engaging in what they call “agent washing,” just rebranding chatbots and RPA tools as something they’re not.</p><p>When everything is AI-powered, nothing is AI-powered. The label becomes meaningless. Companies end up with a product that technically “has AI” but solves no real problem for anyone.</p><figure><img alt=""Blurred office background with bold text stating, “40% of agentic AI products will be canceled by the end of 2027.” Source noted as Gartner 2025."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oN8afkLbaGy1LtQcg6dMjw.png"" /></figure><h3>The “not having the right people” problem</h3><p>The data scientists and engineers who were interviewed for the RAND report (cited in the article’s introduction) say it’s challenging to find the right talent for AI projects.</p><p>Hiring skilled specialists is an issue, but also how organizations value the talent they already have. Data engineers, the people doing the hard work of cleaning and structuring data so models can learn from it, are treated like second-class citizens. One interviewee literally called them “the plumbers of data science.”</p><p>So they leave. And when they leave, they take all their institutional knowledge with them. No one knows which datasets are reliable anymore; projects stall, and leadership loses interest.</p><p>What about designers? Most AI teams don’t even have one. Or they bring one in at the tail end, when the model is already built, and someone realizes the interface is unusable. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/designers-vs-developers-wrong-fight-age-ai-arin-bhowmick-ja5af""><strong>Designers and developers depend on each other more than ever</strong></a> and should be at the table from day one when building any product, especially those with AI features.</p><p>To support my views and opinions on the topic, I cited a <a href=""https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/when-ai-joins-the-team-better-ideas-surface""><strong>2025 field experiment at Harvard Business School</strong></a> that found that AI-augmented cross-functional teams were three times more likely to generate high-performing ideas than individuals working alone. The designer-developer divide is precisely the kind of silo that the experiment suggests we should break down. And so is the data engineer vs. data scientist one. Different roles, same problem: the people getting sidelined are often the ones who could have “saved” the project, or, at least, brought the most clarity to it.</p><h3>What we can do as design leaders</h3><p>The RAND report focuses on AI/ML model development rather than product design. But the failures they describe, miscommunication, unclear goals, and users as an afterthought, are the same ones killing AI products today. There’s a golden opportunity for <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/what-design-leaders-must-unlearn-to-lead-in-an-ai-first-world-f131652f828d"">design leaders to step into that gap.</a></p><p>Here’s how should move forward:</p><h4>Be THE communicators</h4><p>Industry stakeholders often misunderstand or miscommunicate what problem needs to be solved using AI. Design leaders have a unique opportunity to be the missing link that bridges communication between key stakeholders and software engineers, data scientists, and other AI technologists. We’ve been closely working with them for years building products, so we are the ones who know better how to communicate the right specs. We speak the same language.</p><h4>Follow the one-year rule</h4><p>RAND’s report says that before they begin any AI project, leaders should be prepared to commit each product team to solving a specific problem for at least a year. If an AI project is not worthy of such a long-term commitment, it most likely is not worth committing to at all, especially because an AI project with an overly accelerated timeline is likely to fail without ever achieving its intended goal. Designers are essential for creating products people want to use, so this rule extends to our teams. We need that time for research, testing, iterating, and validating. You can’t design a meaningful AI experience in a two-week sprint.</p><h4>Put the problem statement on the wall, not the tech stack</h4><p>The AI products that succeed are those focused on the problem they are meant to solve. As design leaders, we should be the ones writing the problem statement that guides the entire project. What I mean by this is a clear, human-centered problem statement that everyone, from the CTO to the junior data engineer, can rally around.</p><h4>Own the workflow mapping</h4><p>One of the most common failure patterns mentioned in the RAND report is building an AI model that doesn’t fit into the business workflow. It works in isolation but breaks when it meets reality. That’s design territory, because we are trained to map user journeys, service blueprints, and task flows. We see where an AI feature fits into someone’s day, and where it doesn’t. If we’re mapping these workflows before the engineering team starts building, we save the entire project from that painful moment when a technically sound model turns out to be operationally useless.</p><h4>Ask, “Do we need AI for this?”</h4><p>Not every problem requires AI. As design leaders, we should have the confidence to ask the uncomfortable questions. Sometimes the best design decision is the simplest one, and saying “this doesn’t need AI, it needs a better interface” might be the most valuable contribution you make to the entire project.</p><figure><img alt=""A group of designers and developers gathered around a whiteboard labeled “Problem Statement.” One man presents while pointing to sticky notes and diagrams, as others sit at computer workstations listening and collaborating."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Kxik8bvZ0dJw4JFZuGmFYw.png"" /><figcaption>Image Credit: AI Generated Image</figcaption></figure><h3>The missing piece to AI product success</h3><p>Designers and engineers focused on solving real user problems. That is how we build AI products that genuinely improve people’s lives.</p><p>The gap between what companies say they want AI to achieve and what users actually need is a design leadership issue. To achieve real success, we must reframe the conversation from shiny new features to solving real user problems.</p><p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arinb""><em>Arin Bhowmick</em></a><em> (</em><a href=""https://twitter.com/arinbhowmick""><em>@arinbhowmick</em></a><em>) is Chief Design Officer at SAP, based in San Francisco, California.

They give you a system.</p><p>But Alexander was never interested in just the system. He was interested in what he called “the quality without a name” — something alive, whole, experienced — that emerges when patterns are followed well but can never be reduced to logic alone. He tried word after word to capture it. None were sufficient. The quality resists naming. It can only be felt.</p><p>I studied such phenomena at the University of Pennsylvania. Architecture history and theory. I spent countless hours thinking about the relationship between ideas on form and proportion, the structures created from those ideas, and the life that happens inside of them. My final thesis examined how concepts of nature in urban theory shape the way we read and design cities. Three canonical texts on urbanism, three entirely different readings of the same city, because each began with a different understanding of what was “natural.” The foundational mental models we carry into a problem structure everything that follows.</p><p>Attunement to that tension has stayed with me. The pattern is the structure. The pattern came from distilling ideas and experiences. But what makes a place — what makes any made thing — feel alive is something the pattern enables but does not contain.</p><p>What I am uncovering — and what has been genuinely surprising — twenty years later and in an entirely different medium, is that the same tension lives inside the instructions we write for AI.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ut-R4ivcHKM9dNChdr_b1Q.png"" /><figcaption><em>In this collage: Instructions from “A Pattern Language” — Pattern 128, Indoor Sunlight; photograph of Fallingwater; covers of Collage City (Rowe &amp; Koetter), Architecture of the City (Rossi), S,M,L,XL (Koolhaas).</em> <em>Image credit: Christopher Alexander, A Pattern Language, Oxford University Press, 1977 (pattern excerpt); personal photograph (Fallingwater, 2005); book covers from Collage City, The Architecture of the City, and S,M,L,XL used for educational reference.</em></figcaption></figure><p>/</p><p>I used to write a lot. I have stacks of essays no one will ever read. But they sharpened something — the way I pull ideas together, the way I form very long sentences, the way I know in my intuition, not my intellect, when something lands.</p><p>Then life happened. Architecture for eight-ish years, a pivot into product design for the past ten-ish, two kids. Most days I vacillate between corporate theater, recreating K-pop demon hunter hairstyles, long conversations with engineers to grok the technical enough to translate it into the experiential, and putting nutritious meals on the table that go largely underappreciated. Between all this life, I still had ideas I wanted to better formulate with words. I craved that time at a carrel stacked with texts in a library — putting concepts together into an essay, hard-coding what I was feeling into a cohesive perspective. But the hours for that type of work had disappeared. The practice of writing had largely gone quiet.</p><p>So I ran an experiment. I took writing I loved — my own writing, from when I had the time to be careful with it — and I fed it to Claude. Not to generate new text. To analyze. This was my exact prompt:</p><blockquote>“I want you to look at these articles I wrote and analyze the writing mechanics I used in them to create instructions for this project space. I will write several articles in this project and I want them to sound like me and leverage some of the things I did in these articles and apply them to articles in the future.”</blockquote><p>What Claude identified was a penchant for varying sentence lengths. Shocking, right? Moving back and forth in time — from cave paintings at Lascaux, 40,000 BC, to Haegue Yang, a South Korean sculptor working in installation today. The “/” section breaks I use instead of headers. The way I embed lists in prose rather than bullets. The em dashes that let me think sideways mid-sentence — which I get called out for at work as a negative, but get to trademark as an aesthetic signature here.</p><p>A pattern language for <em>my</em> writing.</p><p>I don’t use that phrase flippantly. Because what I found myself holding was exactly what Alexander described: a collection of recurring solutions to recurring problems of expression, each one specific enough to be actionable but open enough to generate infinite variation. Not a template. Not a formula. A language — in the Alexandrian sense — that I can use to build something that feels like mine even when I am not building it alone.</p><p>This move — from intuitive practice to explicit instruction — is something designers in the field are increasingly grappling with. In a thoughtful<a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/a-ux-designer-guide-to-prompt-f045cd839489""> UX Collective piece on prompting as design craft</a>, Paz Perez frames prompting not as a trick for getting AI to comply, but as the new medium through which designers articulate intent: “Effective communication, whether with people or machines, depends on context.” She’s describing something deeper than prompt hygiene. She’s describing the need to externalize what we usually carry internally — the instinct, the judgment, the taste.</p><p>/</p><p>This changed something. Not because Claude now “writes like me” — that’s too simplified. It changed something because I now understand my own craft in a way I didn’t before. I can see the moves I make. I can name them.</p><p>Alexander wanted patterns to be legible to ordinary people — not just architects. When he interviewed for a position as head of the architecture department at Cambridge and was asked who his first hire would be, he said a carpenter. The panel pressed: which <em>named architect</em>? He persisted. Who after the carpenter? “A mason.” He didn’t get the job.</p><p>The point was radical to academics: the people who make things should understand the patterns they’re working with. The knowledge shouldn’t live with experts alone. It should be owned by the people who construct and inhabit the spaces.</p><p>That’s what happened when I extracted my writing patterns. The knowledge stopped being locked inside intuitive practice and became something I could hold, examine, refine. The instructions aren’t just for Claude. They’re for me — a mirror held up to accumulated craft.</p><p>The philosopher Michael Polanyi captured this asymmetry in a phrase — “We can know more than we can tell.” His point was that most sophisticated human skill is tacit — embedded in the body, in habit, in intuition — and therefore almost impossible to fully articulate. What I find remarkable about writing instructions for AI is that it forces exactly this kind of articulation. The tacit becomes explicit, not because the AI demands it, but because without that explicitness, the AI produces something competent and hollow. You have to tell it what you know.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-bFFsDcP6F0XSxBTYfz6sg.png"" /><figcaption><em>Collage includes: K-pop inspired hairstyle recreation; the Rosetta Stone; an illustration from Wired Magazine by Koma Zhang.</em> <em>Image credit: Personal photograph (hairstyle); The Rosetta Stone, © The Trustees of the British Museum; illustration by</em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/komaciel/""><em> Koma Zhang</em></a><em> for Wired Magazine.</em></figcaption></figure><p>/</p><p>My writing process these days is messy, but <em>it is happening</em>. I am always the first one up, before the kids are fully conscious, and I talk. Speech input — Wispr Flow into a Google Doc on my phone — putting ideas down while making breakfast or packing lunches. It gives my writing a spoken quality I actually prefer to what comes out when I type carefully. Then I bring those fragments to the Claude project space where my instructions are housed — along with other writings as context and memory — and we go back and forth. Claude generates a draft. I edit, weave concepts in and out, rewrite in a Google Doc, send it back. And so on. The AI holds the scaffolding; I do the building.</p><p>I want to be clear: this is not content generation. Not slop. I hope you are experiencing the difference.</p><p>Language is a technology. This is easy to forget because we are born into it, but it is one of the oldest and most sophisticated tools humans have ever developed — and some people have a mastery of it that I do not. My spelling is terrible. My punctuation, left to my own devices, is creative at best. But I know how I want something to feel. I know how I want it to land. And a large language model is not magic. It is human language, compressed. Billions of words written by people, distilled through neural networks into mathematical weights and probabilities — patterns of how language follows language, learned at a scale no individual could achieve. When I give it instructions drawn from my own writing, I am not outsourcing my voice. I am using the largest pattern-recognition engine ever built to help me stay faithful to patterns I already own but cannot always execute alone.</p><p>That’s what the instructions capture. Not rules. Sensibility. The pattern is the structure. What emerges — if the pattern is well crafted — is the quality without a name.</p><p>/</p><p>I was listening to the<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1KQRPtgiM0&amp;list=PLB9gMmtMLXxsa8C0PzHFL2tJFh7FrKrYD""> Hard Fork podcast</a> recently and they covered romance novel writers using AI. New York Times reporter Alexandra Alter talked about how the explosion of AI-assisted books has made one thing obvious: you need very specific instructions if you want anything convincing for the genre. There are tells. Phrases the models default to when you don’t guide them. AI is still bad at human emotion, at nuance, at the art of the slow burn. Apparently “he said her name like a ragged prayer” appears in book after book — a phrase the model’s weights favor heavily, surfacing again and again across novels by different AI-assisted authors. One prolific romance writer turned instructor, Carol Hart, tells her students to always add the LLM instruction: <em>make it slow and agonizing. Do not rush to the finish.</em></p><p>This made me laugh, but also made sense. The unguided, uninstructed output has a specific lack of texture. You can feel it. Competent and smooth and saying nothing of depth. Falling back on the same tricks. No quality without a name. It’s the architectural equivalent of a building that follows code but has no life in it — technically correct, humanly dead. Alexander spent his career fighting exactly this. The pattern exists to prevent it. The instruction exists to prevent it.</p><p>The craft is in the specificity. In the personal. In the particular.</p><p>Katy Neale, a UX designer who writes about the intersection of AI and practice, recently articulated this from the product design side. In<a href=""https://medium.com/@katyneale/prompt-engineering-is-the-new-ux-skill-b3a58cb00e14""> her piece on Medium</a>, she argues that prompt engineering is less a technical skill than a design skill — that it requires the same kind of user-contextual thinking designers already do, just applied to the AI system itself: “We’re not just learning a new tool — we’re discovering a fundamental skill that will define how humans interact with technology for decades to come.” She’s right. But I want to push it a little further: we’re not just communicating with the machine. We’re learning to articulate ourselves.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4JRJlDprL3QfPB0zl0SuZA.png"" /><figcaption>Collage includes: <em>A few example Topics with their corresponding Descriptions and Instructions from testing on a fictional shipping company called “ShipIT.”</em> <em>Image credit: Original documentation created by the author for AI testing purposes.</em></figcaption></figure><p>/</p><p>As you might imagine, I am finding deep resonance between this personal writing practice and my day job. I lead the design of an AI agent for customer service representatives. It helps reps resolve cases by generating step-by-step service plans grounded in a company’s actual policies, knowledge base, and case data. The quality of those plans depends almost entirely on one thing: the quality of the instructions.</p><p>In the system we’re working within, you write <em>topics</em> — categories that tell the agent what kind of case it’s looking at — and <em>instructions</em> — the specific guidance the agent should follow. Add a skill and those intructions can take actions. A topic might be “Return Request.” An instruction might be: “Make sure the customer has provided the required information, including a valid return date, customer name, and receipt or order number.” Another: “If the customer provides the order number, then search the return in the Order Management System using the order number and return date.” Simple language. Clear conditional logic. One task per instruction. If this, then that. Always, must, verify.</p><p>What we’re asking enterprise customers to do is exactly what Alexander proposed: build a pattern language. Each topic is a category. Each instruction is a pattern — a recurring problem paired with its solution, expressed clearly enough that anyone — or any reasoning engine — can apply it, but specific enough that what emerges is grounded in that company’s actual reality.</p><p>What I didn’t expect was what happens to companies in the process of writing those instructions. The act of articulating how your business works — clearly enough for a reasoning engine to follow — is a form of forced introspection. Organizations discover that processes they assumed were well-defined actually live in someone’s head, or differ team to team, or were never documented at all. You try to tell an agent how to handle a return and realize there <em>is</em> no documented policy for the edge case. You write an instruction for escalation and discover that different offices escalate differently and nobody has reconciled the approaches.</p><p>This connects to something knowledge management researchers have been tracking for decades: what Polanyi called tacit knowledge is precisely what organizations lose when experienced employees leave, and precisely what AI instruction-writing forces them to surface. Writing instructions isn’t just configuration. It is, as one research framework puts it, <em>externalization</em> — converting what has lived in practice into something that can be shared, reviewed, and refined. The same way extracting my writing patterns made my craft visible to me, writing AI instructions makes a company’s operational logic visible to itself.</p><p>And the testing is where the craft deepens. The word “artisan” has started circulating in conversations about developers working with AI agents — and it resonates. You write instructions, test them against hundreds of simulated interactions, review where the agent fails or drifts, trace its reasoning, refine, test again. It’s iterative and nondeterministic — you cannot predict the output the way you can with traditional software, because these are reasoning systems, not rule engines. Success requires a disposition toward experimentation, toward relationship with the system rather than control of it.</p><p>And like Alexander’s patterns, the best instructions generate something that exceeds them. A dynamic service plan that evolves in real time as new information arrives — creating resolution steps on the fly, checking whether an action can be automated, falling back to human guidance when it can’t. The instructions provide the structure. But the quality without a name — that lives in the encounter itself. How the customer experiences the company. How they feel treated. How what started as a support interaction begins to feel like relationship.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SuFqHJNASOGRrhdWcsRcVQ.png"" /><figcaption>Collage includes: <em>Diagram showing the flow of information from a voice call through an AI reasoning engine, through protocol identification, to the AI agent generating a service plan for the representative — with Ryoji Ikeda’s “data-verse 1” (2019) layered underneath.</em> <em>Image credit: Original process diagram by the author; Ryoji Ikeda, “data-verse 1,” 2019. Image of artwork used for illustrative/editorial purposes.</em></figcaption></figure><p>/</p><p>B. Joseph Pine II — the same thinker who gave us <em>The Experience Economy</em> — argues in his most recent work that we are entering what he calls the Transformation Economy. Goods, services, even memorable experiences are no longer enough. Customers want to change. They want to become healthier, more knowledgeable, more capable. They want to reach their aspirations. The highest form of economic value, Pine argues, is guiding that transformation.</p><p>I’ve been sitting with this idea because it sharpens everything I’ve been describing. If Pine is right — and I think he is — then the bar for enterprise instructions rises dramatically. It’s no longer enough to resolve a case or close a ticket. The instructions need to create structure for personalized experiences that move beyond traditional support. The interaction between a brand and its customer — at the point of contact, in the moment of need — becomes an opportunity not just for resolution but for growth.</p><p>This is where I think instruction-writing becomes intellectual property.</p><p>Just as I understand the mechanics of how I write — because I know how I want it to land — companies can understand how they want their brand to be experienced and begin to codify that into instructions. We used to have knowledge articles and training manuals. Static documents. One-size-fits-all. Now we have instructions that generate dynamic, adaptive experiences — addressing a specific person, a specific problem, in a specific moment. The interaction is repeatable in structure but unique in execution.</p><p>The companies that invest in the quality and depth of their instructions will differentiate themselves. Their instructions will reflect how deeply they understand their own customers, their own processes, their own values. That understanding — encoded into patterns clear enough for AI to follow but rich enough to feel alive — becomes a form of brand. Not brand as logo or tagline, but brand as experience. The felt quality of interacting with an organization that knows itself and knows what it wants for the people it serves.</p><p>The instruction set will be the IP. The craft of writing it will be the competitive advantage.</p><p>/</p><p>There’s a flip side. The explosion of content — writing, agents, messages, recommendations — is real. More people will use these tools, more output will flood every channel, and the question of how we digest it all doesn’t have an answer yet.</p><p>But I feel good about being able to formulate my thoughts in a way that feels like me. It’s using a technology built from human language to amplify the intelligence I already have. To carry ideas I would have lost in the noise of daily life. To maintain a practice of thinking that the full weight of living had nearly crowded out.</p><p>Alexander’s first book was called <em>Notes on the Synthesis of Form</em> — rigid, scientific, prescriptive. By the time he wrote <em>The Timeless Way of Building</em>, he’d moved toward something softer, more alive. He’d realized that the pattern was necessary but never sufficient. That the life in a building — or a sentence, or an AI-aided support interaction — comes from somewhere the pattern points to but cannot reach.</p><p>The craft of the instruction is the same. It’s the pattern you build so that something beyond the pattern can emerge. Know your own patterns. Name them. Refine them. Own them.</p><p>The craft is always yours. The instruction helps you remember.</p><p><em>This article was written with Claude using writing style instructions developed by analyzing previous work.

The conversation shifts from opinions to behavior. This keeps happening <a href=""https://dust.tt/"">at Dust</a>. We’ve been experimenting with making prototypes our default design artifact. The question driving us:</p><blockquote><strong>What should designers produce to help teams decide faster while raising the quality bar and reducing implementation waste?</strong></blockquote><p>We don’t have a final answer yet. This article is a field report: what we’ve tried so far, what seems to work, and what still feels unresolved.</p><h3>Running a design project at Dust</h3><p>I’ll describe the workflow in the order it usually happens.

I’ll build small flows, prototype the transitions, and sanity-check the parts that static screens often hide (state changes, error cases, motion, empty states, keyboard/navigation/accessibility basics).</p><p>I can very easily use realistic fake data. We’ve pre-generated a bunch of it (people profiles, pictures, names, emails, lists of files and folders, entire conversations…).

I start with behavior and structure; the styling can catch up once the flow holds.

Engineers can reuse components directly, and use the prototype code as reference — because it runs on the same stack, with the same components.</p><h3>Shortcomings</h3><p>Before going into the setup, a few honest trade-offs we’ve run into:</p><ul><li><strong>It’s still a sandbox.</strong> Unless we simulate it, it won’t naturally reproduce real latency, loading states, and backend weirdness.</li><li><strong>Feedback isn’t perfectly smooth</strong>. Vercel’s preview comments can help, but it’s been a bit flaky for us — screenshots + Slack are still the default.</li><li><strong>You occasionally pay the “code tax.”</strong> Most of the time this is faster than mockups, but occasionally you lose 30 minutes to a silly environment or tooling issue. Quite often, the prototype reveals the brief itself is still fuzzy — or that what we asked for isn’t feasible yet.</li><li><strong>It can invite premature polish</strong>. Because it looks real quickly, it’s easy to get dragged into nitpicks before the core interaction is settled.</li><li><strong>Hand-off clarity</strong>. It’s not always clear with engineers what they should directly re-use and what is prototyping.</li></ul><h3>The Setup</h3><p>Dust runs on React, in a monorepo. Our design system (Sparkle) lives there too. Sparkle gives us two complementary places to work:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://storybook.js.org/""><strong>Storybook</strong></a><strong> </strong>for building and documenting components in isolation (variants, interactions, visual regression). It’s our component catalog.</li><li><strong>Playground</strong> is just a small Vite app nested inside Sparkle. It is a fast development server, it starts quickly, refreshes instantly as you edit, and stays lightweight.</li></ul><p><strong>The key point</strong>: both environments consume the same Sparkle source and Tailwind styles, so prototypes reuse real components and tokens by default.</p><h4>Vercel for easy sharing</h4><p>Vercel is a cloud platform that automatically deploys a GitHub branch as a shareable, live URL. For us, if the branch name contains sparkle, Vercel auto-deploys both Storybook and the Playground and posts preview links in the PR — so sharing a runnable prototype is basically instant.</p><p>One thing we haven’t tried yet: bringing real AI interactions into prototypes — streaming responses, agent behavior, conversational flows. Since Dust is an AI product, that’s a meaningful gap in our current setup. Vercel’s serverless functions could be a way to close it.</p><h4>Coding tools</h4><p>The beauty of this setup is that almost any AI coding tool will work. <strong>Claude Code</strong>, <strong>Antigravity</strong>, <strong>Codex</strong> . My tool of choice is often <a href=""https://cursor.com/agents""><strong>Cursor</strong></a><strong> </strong>(for prototyping), but I move between them freely.</p><p>Notable gap: <strong>Lovable</strong>, which I heavily use and love for personal projects, isn’t a good match here — yet. For good simplicity reasons, it doesn’t handle repos as complex as ours or support the kind of professional-grade git collaboration we need.</p><h4>What about Figma?</h4><p>Don’t believe the catchy “RIP Figma” headlines. Figma hasn’t gone anywhere for us. We still use it upstream for mapping journeys, sketching flows, and running brainstorms; downstream for managing visual assets and illustrations.</p><p>It’s taken a back seat in the middle: the step where you translate an idea into something concrete enough to evaluate. It helps that we never treated Figma as the source of truth for product or design system — <em>truth is in the code</em>. That’s a huge potential efficiency win when you flip to prototyping first.</p><p>A note on Figma Make: we haven’t been convinced by it compared to our own setup. Make is designed to generate code from mockups — which makes sense if mockups are your starting point. But if you flip to prototyping first, it doesn’t play well with an existing codebase.</p><h3>The question underneath: should designers work in code?</h3><p>Behind all the talking is the old debate of technical literacy in design. Should designers code? To what extent? Here’s my current take.</p><h4>Belief #1 — Technical literacy is a design skill</h4><p>I’m an industrial designer by training. In industrial design, understanding your materials is not a “nice to have”. If you don’t know how plastic bends, how aluminum behaves, or what manufacturing constraints do to a shape, you design objects that look right in 3D but fail in the hand.</p><p>Digital products are built with a material too: code. Technical literacy does not necessarily mean coding, but it means understanding how a digital system behaves and why.</p><h4>Belief #2 — Designers working in code can improve quality and speed</h4><p>Having designers work in code can be a real accelerator: tighter feedback loops, fewer handoffs, and less drift between what we design and what ships.</p><p>The catch is that this approach doesn’t scale by default. As organizations grow, the product surface expands, the codebase gets more complex, and the friction adds up. Recruiting designers who can both design and contribute significantly to production code — at scale — is hard to rely on as a core strategy.</p><h4>Belief #3 — “Designers coding” cost-benefit has flipped</h4><p>AI is changing the game on three axes:</p><ol><li><strong>It’s easier.</strong> The “need to know” is shrinking and the cost of learning is going down fast.</li><li><strong>It’s faster.</strong> What used to take hours takes minutes. Once you have a runnable baseline, you can explore variations, states, and interactions at a speed that makes static mockups feel like overhead.</li><li><strong>It’s more powerful.</strong> The amount you can build with limited ability is remarkable — full interaction flows, working components, realistic prototypes.</li></ol><p>I won’t pretend this requires zero knowledge. It doesn’t. But the cost-benefit has flipped: what you can do, and how fast you can do it, makes it hard to justify not putting in the effort to acquire the minimal skills required.</p><h3>What does the future look like?</h3><p>The next step for us is bridging the gap between prototypes and implementation. Today, designers rarely make changes directly in production code . Running a local instance of Dust is heavy, and pushing to a test environment is too slow for tight iteration.</p><p>This is changing extremely fast. More on this soon — but if you’re curious, here’s <a href=""https://dust.tt/blog/engineering-at-the-speed-of-ai"">a technical preview of what we’re working on</a>.</p><h3>Closing</h3><p>I keep coming back to a longer historical loop. Design as a distinct practice really took shape when mass production separated roles that used to live in a single person: the craftsperson who could think, make, and sell the object. Once manufacturing scaled beyond the workshop and those roles split, you needed something that could travel between people and disciplines.</p><p>That something wasn’t just a pretty shape. It was a <em>dessein</em>: a drawing, a plan, a set of intentions constrained by technical reality. In other words: a model of the object, expressed in a format compatible with production.</p><p>Digital product design inherited that logic. Static mockups, specs, flows — they’re all versions of the same move: translating intent into a plan that others can implement.</p><p>But when coding (and prototyping) becomes more accessible we’re not only getting faster at producing plans. <strong>We’re regaining the ability to model directly</strong>.</p><p>More like clay than drafting: you shape, you test, you feel, you adjust — with an instantaneous feedback loop. The artifact is no longer a description of the thing. It starts to become the thing, or at least a runnable slice of it.</p><p>Design is moving from planning experiences to modeling them — closer to reality, earlier, and with tighter feedback loops.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=8581f20102ff"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/field-study-prototypes-over-mockups-8581f20102ff"">Field study: prototypes over mockups</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>On self-surveillance, professional performance, and the cost of forgetting that we built the cage.</h4><figure><img alt=""A translucent mask held in hands with a blurred figure in the background, suggesting the separation between performance and identity."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_gP_nYArWNMnQl8l2rAojQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Is this one me? (All conceptual images in this article were generated by the author using AI.)</figcaption></figure><p>As designers, we live performance twice over: as users who perform constantly, and as the creators of the systems that encourage that performance. This article is about the first, but it inevitably speaks to the second.</p><p>I spent forty minutes choosing a profile picture. Forty minutes taking selfies, testing angles, adjusting light, cropping, thinking about how I wanted to be seen. My professional dignity is somehow correlated to how well I can camouflage my aging. For people I’ve never met. Who may never see it.</p><p>While testing angles, I thought: When did this become normal? Then I did something even worse. Or more practical. Or both — I can’t tell the difference anymore.</p><p>I used an AI tool to “enhance” the photo. Adjust the lighting. Add a studio background. Give it that more “professional” look.</p><blockquote>I literally asked an algorithm to tell me what my face should look like.</blockquote><p>And the most depressing part wasn’t doing it. It was that it worked. The photo was “better.” More presentable. More performative.</p><p>I learned this from an influencer with millions of followers. He shows it with data: posts featuring his face generate 40% more engagement. More likes, more comments, more shares. Translation: more visibility, more clients, more revenue. Except you don’t have time to produce 30 different photos a week. So he uses AI to generate headshots of himself in any context. Very practical.</p><p>If you don’t do it, you’re losing reach. If you’re not doing it now, your competitors already are.</p><p>The logic is impeccable.</p><p>And I tested it. Because the data was clear. And anyone who seriously studies metrics has been doing this for months.</p><p>We went from practical to practical. And we distorted ourselves along the way.</p><h3>The promise that worked</h3><p>To be fair: personal branding was born as a promise of freedom.<br />Before, you depended on gatekeepers. Editors deciding whether your writing deserved to exist. HR deciding whether your résumé was “adequate.” Agencies deciding whether you were “relevant enough.” Your competence only mattered if someone with power gave you permission to show it.</p><p>The internet changed that.</p><p>Designers sharing their process on Behance and landing clients on the other side of the world. Writers publishing directly, without a publisher, building real audiences. That brilliant but shy professional who never shone at in-person networking is finally able to let the work speak for itself.<br />And it worked.</p><p>You wouldn’t be reading this if that weren’t true. A substantial part of those without a platform finally gained a voice. Many voices can now be heard, and that is a humanitarian gain. Opportunities that simply wouldn’t have existed 15 years ago became possible.</p><p>Personal branding was empowerment: controlling your own narrative and deciding who you are, instead of accepting the box they put you in.</p><p>But then the market noticed it was working.</p><blockquote>And did what markets do best:<br />systematized, optimized, monetized, and turned it into an obligation.</blockquote><figure><img alt=""Hand adjusting a translucent mask against a soft-focused background, depicting the continuous refinement of professional performance."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PFmLv0kt5vVpF3k0pPh7_A.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Almost natural. Just one more adjustment.</figcaption></figure><h3>When empowerment became compulsory performance</h3><p>“Show your work” became “perform expertise 24/7.”</p><p>“Be authentic” became “authenticity as a brand strategy — here are 10 templates.”</p><p>“Build an audience” became “monetize every second of attention or you’re wasting your potential.”</p><p>And “follow these steps” became the promise that you might finally be seen in an ocean of people competing for attention.</p><p>What was optional became mandatory to survive.</p><p>And again we bought in. Because it works. Those who perform better grow faster. Those who aren’t seen aren’t remembered. Those without a personal brand have no market.</p><p>So you and I performed. And we performed well.</p><h4>We became the product</h4><p>We became a Coca-Cola that needs a logo, a tagline, an editorial calendar, a conversion funnel, alignment with causes, and constant optimization.<br />And now, an increasingly common strategy: turn on the camera. Reels. Stories. Short videos. For some, text is no longer enough. Show your face in motion. Speak directly. Rehearse spontaneity twelve times until it looks natural.</p><p>That uncomfortable task of selling yourself publicly. Of talking alone to a camera. Of feigning naturalness while repeating the same hook three times until it sounds “authentic.”</p><p>The logic is clear: the algorithm prioritizes video, “people trust people.” Showing your face has become synonymous with credibility.</p><p>So they record. Edit. Re-record. Post. And hope those fifteen seconds of filmed discomfort generate the numbers that justify the effort.</p><blockquote>They called it “personal branding.” As if you were a product. We objectified ourselves.</blockquote><p>And what does refusing mean? Becoming invisible in a market where visibility has become a condition of existence.</p><p>We show the quality of our work and what makes us unique — but through so many layers of optimization and strategic performance that the line between substance and packaging begins to disappear. We sell edited versions of ourselves — myself included — for the market to consume.</p><h4>It’s a silent escalation</h4><p>If only this were just a problem of photos.</p><p>It has migrated into everyday communication. That email with eight people copied? You know exactly what happens. Heightened attention. Every word calculated. You’re not writing to communicate — you’re performing competence for an audience you imagine judging every comma.</p><p>And we find ourselves wondering: How will so-and-so read this? What if someone takes it the wrong way? Does this sentence sound confident or arrogant? Is this tone collaborative or passive?</p><p>We edit.</p><p>Re-edit.</p><p>Save the draft.</p><p>Come back.</p><p>Change one word.</p><p>Send.</p><p>And breathe.</p><p>One more theater of efficiency.</p><figure><img alt=""A sharp, in-focus mask in the foreground with a blurred human figure behind it, showing the mask becoming clearer than the person."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aTGFWrN1Hsbecodms47WEg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>I definitely look better this way.</figcaption></figure><h3>The mask that became a face</h3><p>At work, the performance is even more explicit. We have to put on the mask of “I’m the most incredible person you have.” Nothing more than structural survival.</p><p>If you don’t show up, you’re not remembered when promotions come around. Visible performance matters more than silent work. The clarity of your reports ends up defining your perceived reliability.</p><p>So we send weekly reports that are 70% real work, 30% personal marketing. “Key achievements this week,” we write, as if we’d won the space race. That presentation where you rehearsed your “spontaneous contribution” multiple times to impress the people who matter. That calculated moment of waiting a few minutes before responding on Slack, fast enough to seem available, but not so instant that you look desperate or like you have nothing real to do.</p><h4>And it works. Of course it works.</h4><p>Managers love employees who are clear, proactive, communicative. Organizational efficiency improves. Engagement goes up. Everyone wins.</p><p><strong>Does it, though? What’s the cost?</strong></p><p>The cost is invisible but real. Time spent editing messages instead of thinking through the problem that actually needs solving. Mental energy wasted anticipating imaginary judgments. The constant anxiety of being misunderstood or forgotten.</p><p>Professional decisions made based on “what will look good,” until you forget what actually matters.</p><p>Because beneath all this performative efficiency, there’s exhaustion. A permanent sense of inadequacy. You never sent all the updates you should have. Never participated in all the strategic meetings. Never read all the messages or the endless email threads. Never took enough initiative in company-wide meetings. Never had enough visibility to be remembered when the promotion came.</p><p>And the more you try, the more you confirm that <strong>you’re not enough</strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""Two hands pressed against a translucent barrier from inside, palms open, depicting confinement in a self-built prison."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*c0DUYalI8FDA_Lcx8JcVGA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>What was the way out again?</figcaption></figure><h3>Voluntary prisoners</h3><p>We built our own prison. There is no captor. No explicit coercion. But there are invisible bars, internalized, real. Bars made of constant visibility, of public metrics, of social validation as the currency of professional survival.<br />And we built them. Post by post.</p><p>It’s a practical necessity. Your career and market relevance depend on it. You perform without even noticing. Until you lose the ability to distinguish what you want from what you need to demonstrate.</p><p>I say this as someone who has already built a platform. Portfolio, clients, margin. What about those trying to enter? There’s no “before performing.” You start already performing. The prison has floors. Some think about leaving. Others, about getting in. That doesn’t invalidate the critique. It just situates who has the margin to make it.</p><h4>Nothing worse than becoming a voluntary enforcer</h4><p>That colleague who delivers exceptional work but doesn’t post their process? “They need to learn to communicate better.”</p><p>That designer who doesn’t update their portfolio every month?<br />“Doesn’t know how to sell themselves.”</p><p>You’ve internalized the logic so thoroughly that you now police it for free.<br />And when someone criticizes the system, we feel indignation. Almost a personal attack.</p><p>“Well, I grew because of it. You’re being naive; this is just how the world works now.”</p><p>Someone pointed at the prison, and we explained why the bars are necessary.</p><figure><img alt=""A heart shape drawn on a foggy glass barrier with hands visible below, representing affection directed toward one’s own confinement."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mCfzlDWITl7GOUI6JwHReQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Privileged to be here.</figcaption></figure><h3>And we’re still grateful</h3><p>The results are real. That client from networking, that promotion, they happened. Visibility works. For those who need to build material security, this isn’t superficial.</p><p>The problem arises when we lose the ability to distinguish: am I doing this because I chose to, or because I can no longer imagine any other way of existing professionally?</p><p>And when we achieve something?</p><p><strong>Genuine gratitude, or a performance of contentment?</strong></p><p>I don’t even know anymore.</p><p>So we post about gratitude. About the “privilege of doing what you love.” About lessons from the journey. About how our team is “the most incredible family in the world,” how the company culture “transforms lives.”</p><p>#grateful.</p><h4>The moment identity disappears</h4><p>But there comes a moment, sooner or later, when that thought surfaces.<br />“That opinion I posted… do I actually believe it, or was it because it would generate engagement?”</p><p>“That project I chose… did it interest me, or did it just make better content?”</p><p>“That moment of introspection…</p><p>Did I need to think?</p><p>Or was I already performing introspection?”</p><p>And maybe we no longer know. We’ve performed for so long that we don’t know who we’d be without it.</p><figure><img alt=""A blurred interface or document visible through translucent glass with a human figure observing it, symbolizing designers viewing their own creations."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tnPAz5xqu5ndwIUuZIv8Ug.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Ready for personal use.</figcaption></figure><h3>And who designs all this?</h3><p>Us. Designers, UX, product managers.</p><p>I’m not saying we do it in bad faith. Most genuinely believe they’re “improving the experience.” But let’s be honest about what that means:<br />Public validation metrics — views, likes, shares — so you know in real time exactly how well you’re performing.</p><ul><li><strong>The “seen” receipt <br /></strong>It obligates you to respond immediately, or perform an excuse.</li><li><strong>“Typing…”<br /></strong>It makes you rewrite your message knowing they can see you typing.</li><li><strong>Who viewed your profile<br /></strong>Sold as a premium feature. Monetizing paranoia.</li><li><strong>Your profile is 73% complete<br /></strong>Amanufactured sense of being unfinished.</li><li><strong>Seen by 47 people<br /></strong>Paranoia about who saw it and said nothing.</li><li><strong>Active now</strong> <br />Logging in as a public declaration of presence.</li></ul><p>Interfaces designed to manipulate decisions. Features that create behavioral dependency. Architectures that hijack your time.</p><p>All of this has a name. <a href=""https://www.deceptive.design/""><strong>Dark patterns</strong></a>. <strong>Addictive design</strong>. <strong>Attention capture</strong></p><p>Every discomfort you feel was engineered.</p><h4>And it worked. Better than we imagined.</h4><p>We built systems so efficient that they now face litigation. <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2026/01/27/nx-s1-5684196/social-media-kids-addiction-mental-health-trial"">Meta and YouTube for addictive design</a>. <a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/09/ftc-secures-historic-25-billion-settlement-against-amazon"">Amazon fined for impossible cancellation flows</a>. <a href=""https://www.digital-fairness-act.com/"">The European Union classified 97% of the most popular App Store applications as containing dark patterns</a> and began regulating the sector.<br />But when you’re on the product team, the metrics make sense. Engagement up 40%. Retention improved. We celebrate. Bonuses. A success case for the portfolio.</p><p><strong>We are, unfortunately, optimizing addiction.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""A hand against a barrier with intersecting lines or wires overlaid, representing interconnected surveillance and tracking systems."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*s7-C6NFcoyM8HzULNmyTyA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>I have bad news.</figcaption></figure><h3>The inevitable convergence</h3><p>This constant performance, this voluntary self-optimization, this prison we built… The corporate market is systematizing all of it. Developing tools that don’t just observe your performance — they help you perform better. With data, insights, algorithmic empathy.</p><blockquote>And the worst part: we’ll accept it. Because refusing means falling behind.</blockquote><p>The pieces already exist. <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68067022"">Amazon uses tracking systems — wristbands and scanners that monitor warehouse workers’ productivity every second</a>, generating “idle time” metrics. Microsoft Viva analyzes your communication patterns and productivity. Humanyze monitors tone of voice and body language in interactions. Insurance companies offer discounts in exchange for health data.</p><p>In isolation, each seems reasonable. But when they talk to each other?<br />You stay late working on an urgent proposal. Your laptop logs nighttime productivity. Your smartwatch logs insufficient sleep. Your calendar shows six meetings in one day.</p><p>The system infers: “Problematic time management. Procrastination during working hours. Burnout risk.”</p><p>You probably won’t be consulted. The system will build a behavioral profile you’ve never seen, but that your manager can access. That interface is likely already being built by talented designers and engineers, perhaps even well-intentioned ones, who believe they’re solving real problems.</p><h4>And how will it be sold?</h4><p>“Empowerment through data.”</p><p>“Enhanced self-awareness.”</p><p>“Personalized support.”</p><p>The messaging will be empathetic, careful, almost moving.<br />But you didn’t define what “healthy” looks like. They did. You didn’t choose to be monitored. You just accepted it, because refusing would mean “not caring about your own development.”</p><p>It’s the same logic as the profile picture.</p><p>Every step is perfectly rational. Supremely practical.</p><p><strong>And we keep distorting ourselves.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""A person’s hands held together in contemplation, clearly visible without barriers, suggesting awareness and presence outside of performance."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y5ddbSG-7Q71-zTZ8h_vrA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Here I am.</figcaption></figure><h3>There any redemption?</h3><p>I don’t believe the solution is deleting your account or retreating to the woods. And you probably won’t stop performing — I won’t. The game exists. Refusing to play is a privilege most people don’t have.<br />But there is a difference between performing with the awareness that it’s theater, and believing that the theater is you.</p><p>If you need to edit the photo to get in the game, that’s fine. A diplomat wears a suit, a doctor wears a white coat; you wear a profile picture. We put on masks because the world demands it. This is ritual, contingent on the moment we’re living in. It is neither eternal nor natural.</p><p>The problem was never the mask. It was forgetting you were wearing one.<br />I write this knowing that this very text participates in the same structure, it will be shared, and it will be performed. Awareness of the theater doesn’t take me off the stage. It only reminds me that I’m on it too.</p><p>But what makes us sick is not the performance itself, it’s the sustained lie. The manager who posts about human-centered culture while expecting replies at 11pm. The designer who celebrates inclusivity but never questions the product’s exclusionary metrics. The professional who performs gratitude while feeling nothing but exhaustion.</p><p>Awareness of the theater is what prevents moral dissonance. When you know it’s performance, you preserve mental energy for what truly matters. Your family. Your values. Your actual competence.</p><figure><img alt=""A person with hands in reflective pose, with a blurred screen or interface visible in the background, depicting conscious work and agency."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uAr7q8SqhJ6CiUlqhZZeVA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>What if I changed this?</figcaption></figure><h4>And us, as designers?</h4><p>For us, creators of systems, designers, UX, product managers, there is always a gap.</p><p>A gap between “what the metric demands” and “what I know is right.”</p><p>A gap between “what will perform better in the A/B test” and “what won’t leave the user feeling manipulated afterward.”</p><p>The gap isn’t always navigable. There are moments when the system leaves no room, when the choice is between compromising the design or compromising the paycheck.</p><h4>But the gap exists.</h4><p>And culture is never static. It is always transforming. What holds value today becomes irrelevant tomorrow. What seems inevitable today, five years from now, is embarrassing.</p><p>Remember when smoking on planes was normal? When doctors recommended cigarettes? When asbestos was the “material of the future”? When tobacco advertising sponsored Formula 1? When children’s advertising had no limits? When drunk driving was socially tolerated? When no one wore a seatbelt?</p><p>I know, the damage of the attention economy is different. It’s diffuse, psychological, subjective. You can’t prove in court that the infinite scroll “caused” your anxiety the way cigarettes caused cancer.</p><p>So the change will be slower. More fragmented. It won’t be “we banned dark patterns.” It will be “some companies realize that trust is worth more than engagement, and that becomes a competitive advantage.”</p><p>Change doesn’t come overnight. It comes from accumulated small acts of resistance. From designers who, when they can, choose not to add that manipulative feature. From PMs who advocate for satisfaction metrics, not just time-on-platform. From companies that realize — late, but realize — that trust is worth more than predatory engagement.</p><h4>The market transforms.</h4><p>Fines, lawsuits, and regulations have already begun to appear. Companies are changing because it’s become too costly to stay the same. The market is extremely fluid and hates losing money.</p><h4>Perception transforms.</h4><p>Users already know they’re being manipulated. Teenagers already say “I know this is addictive, but I can’t stop.” Parents are already looking for basic phones for their children. Entire generations growing up distrustful of likes. Books like Jonathan Haidt’s The Anxious Generation and Johann Hari’s Stolen Focus are worldwide bestsellers.</p><p>None of this comes close to solving everything. But it creates space.<br />It creates conditions for products to function without depending on addiction. For professionals to build a presence without constant theatricality. For the process — not just the polished result — to hold recognized value.</p><p>And when designers, creators, and builders of systems begin to see our own complicity, the tools we create begin to change too.</p><p>Because we realize that systems that consume people eventually consume us as well.</p><p>Redemption, if it exists, is not individual. It is not “I saved myself, good luck to the rest.” It is collective, far slower than it should be, and full of setbacks.</p><p>But it is possible.</p><p>Small cracks in the system. Minimal gestures, repeated until they become culture. We stay in the game, but play it a little differently. A little more consciously.</p><p>And when we have the choice, we can choose to lie a little less.</p><p>Maybe it won’t change the world. But it keeps a piece of you intact.</p><p>And that, in itself, is already a beginning.</p><h4>To continue the conversation</h4><p>Thank you for following me through this reflection.

<h4>The future of digital advertising should feel less like a distraction and more like recommendations from a friend.</h4><figure><img alt=""A delicate watercolor and graphite sketch of a smartphone screen showing a chat interface where one specific message bubble is glowing with a warm, golden light, symbolizing a high-utility, relevant answer"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3gimrvTxVY4VhPIvGKaU5A.png"" /><figcaption><em>High relevance ads could enhance the quality of the content.</em></figcaption></figure><p>I’m a <strong>product designer</strong> and for the last four years I have been working in digital advertising for tech. I wouldn’t have imagined building part of my career in advertising, but here I am, and I have found myself honestly enjoying the challenge. Through this experience, I have learned that <strong>healthy and fair advertising</strong> is actually a good thing for the industry. It helps brands reach people, and it helps people find what they are looking for. When ads are well-executed, they are great content. There have been amazing pieces of advertisement across history, and when you pair great ads with great products, magic happens.</p><p>A few days ago, ChatGPT started <a href=""https://openai.com/index/testing-ads-in-chatgpt/"">testing ads</a> within its conversations. The first screenshots show a safe and expected approach: a user starts a conversation around a specific vertical, the model gives a standard AI answer, and then it shows an ad related to the conversation keywords. This replicates the model used in other media platforms by capturing signals and showing inventory that matches them. It’s a safe starting point, but it feels simplistic considering the possibilities of AI. There should be a more sophisticated way to do this. We need a model that treats ads not as an interruption, but as <strong>high-utility content</strong> that actually improves the experience.</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of a ChatGPT interface showing a ‘Potluck power tips’ response followed by a sponsored ad from ‘Heirloom Groceries’ for an Enchilada Kit, featuring price, stock status, and a small product image."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KHxGNphfpnapvof7EIbXog.jpeg"" /><figcaption><em>OpenAI’s initial test displays ads as sponsored links following a conversational response.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The immediate reaction from many is that ads in ChatGPT will harm the user experience. I think that if the strategy is well executed, it could <strong>improve the quality of recommendations</strong>. My rationale is based on the <strong>data source</strong>. When platforms create an ad ecosystem, they have a real incentive to digest merchant catalogs, local service listings, and travel databases. Once this content is set up for advertisers, it can be used to power general responses, too.</p><p>Currently, when you ask ChatGPT about a product or local service, it likely scrapes multiple websites. This doesn’t guarantee the metadata is right or updated. A <strong>direct integration</strong> with a business’s database ensures freshness and reliability. It is the technical difference between scraping a UI and communicating directly through an <strong>API</strong>. I don’t doubt that advertisers, from global retailers to local barber shops, are waiting for the moment they can upload their catalogs and service lists directly to OpenAI. As <a href=""https://www.roidna.com/blog/advertising-in-the-age-of-llms-what-happens-when-ai-becomes-the-ad-platform/"">industry reports from <strong>ROI·DNA</strong></a> suggest we are entering an era where brand-verified catalogs become a fundamental part of the reasoning layer, allowing the model to ground its advice in high-quality, real-time data rather than just scraped noise.</p><p>Think of it this way: if you ask about running shoes today, the model analyzes your context and scrapes the web. It reads reviews and influencer videos, but it is unlikely to find professional, unbiased benchmarking. Most of these sources already have sponsored rankings, so the content is already biased by <strong>SEO games</strong>. The model might show you an organized summary, but it’s coming from already <strong>biased and probably sponsored sources</strong>. The products might also be out of stock or the technical specs might be outdated.</p><p>In a new model, the AI would bypass this noise by directly integrating with <strong>rich catalogs</strong> of shoes, boutique hotels, or specialized medical services. These databases include real-time price, stock, and local availability. When doing research, the model could cross-reference this first-hand data with community reviews or scientific research. This also <strong>levels the playing field</strong>, as smaller, local brands could be part of that same inventory.</p><p>By leaning into this infrastructure now, OpenAI is pulling ahead of most competitors. They are building a better recommendation experience under the guise of an ad network, establishing the <strong>technical pipes required for commerce </strong>before others even begin. <strong>Google</strong> remains a unique incumbent here. Through its shopping features, it has spent years perfecting an ecosystem of real-time merchant data. While Google may be better positioned to activate these features when they decide to fully commit to AI ads, OpenAI’s moves are defining a new standard for what a helpful recommendation engine in the AI world looks like.</p><p>My take on the recent <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De-_wQpKw0s"">Anthropic ad campaign</a>, which brilliantly mocks the scenario where ads become intruders in the conversation, is that while it is a great piece of marketing, it only addresses the “noisy” version of advertising. In a scenario where ads are treated as high-quality, verified content, this satirical picture no longer fits. More importantly, LLMs that fail to integrate these APIs and catalogs soon risk falling behind in the race to provide the best commercial recommendations because that is a primary use case for AI users today.</p><p>I often think of the analogy of a friend recommending a product. If you tell a friend who is passionate about bikes that you’re looking for a weekend ride, they don’t just shout a brand name at you. They ask about your taste, your budget, and your local terrain. They are a friend first, understanding your context before suggesting a solution. This is the difference between <strong>advertising as noise and advertising as advice.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""A minimalist watercolor study of two friends sitting at a cafe table; one is gesturing while a faint, sketched bicycle appears as a shared thought between them."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QNSAdwJd_H2s30QaPRdENg.png"" /><figcaption><em>AI recommendations should feel like a conversation between friends.</em></figcaption></figure><p>This analogy brings us to a <strong>“neutrality paradox.”</strong> A good AI analysis should rank options based on what is actually best for the user, rather than who paid the most. Critics will rightly ask: how can the model remain an unbiased advisor if it’s also the salesperson? To get this right, OpenAI must maintain a <strong>strict wall</strong> between the model’s reasoning and the ad auction. The AI should first determine the ideal solution for the user, and only then see if there is an ad that matches that specific intent. If the best suggestion happens to be sponsored content, everyone wins. If the model starts nudging users toward an ad just to hit a revenue target, the trust is gone.</p><p>For this neutrality to feel real, it has to be visible. This means following the rules of digital advertising, like <strong>clear labeling</strong>. If a recommendation is sponsored, the user should know exactly why it’s there and have the power to opt out or mute specific ads entirely. Trust isn’t built by camouflaging the ads, it’s built by giving the user <strong>visibility and control</strong>.</p><p>This new paradigm also has massive implications for <strong>user agency</strong>. Think of a scenario where, when planning a trip, the model surfaces a tiny local coffee shop that just opened in your destination: a business that otherwise could never afford to compete with big brands for global SEO. Perhaps because the user specifically asked for small local businesses. For this to work, OpenAI has to solve the <strong>“pay to play”</strong> barrier. If only the giants can afford to bid, the user’s preference for local shops becomes a dead end. A fair game requires a model where relevance and values can occasionally outrank a large ad budget.</p><figure><img alt=""A warm, glowing watercolor of a small local coffee shop storefront standing out in vibrant color against a muted, grey-sketched city background."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3ylFl0Cshsq07DBHsYxJFg.png"" /><figcaption><em>Find local businesses that matter to you.</em></figcaption></figure><p>This leads to a shift away from one-way communication. Most ads today are static broadcast. In this new model, an ad becomes a <strong>two-way dialogue</strong>. Instead of a generic banner, the ad can become an interactive experience that answers specific questions about a product’s features. It moves from interruption to <strong>consultation</strong>, surfacing only the parts of a product relevant to your current need. The model becomes more like a great salesperson that answers your questions, one who knows when to say, “I have nothing to offer you right now, but it was great having a conversation with you.”</p><p>This approach also enables better <strong>discovery</strong>. Traditional search is limited by what we know to ask for. In a conversation, an AI can identify a need that the user hasn’t yet put a name to. This is a shift toward a discovery-based experience, similar to what platforms like <strong>Pinterest</strong> have spent years perfecting. As <a href=""https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/ads-candidate-generation-using-behavioral-sequence-modeling-f9077ee1325d"">Pinterest Engineering notes</a>, ads are most effective when they are designed to inspire and connect users with ideas they genuinely love rather than acting as a simple distraction.</p><p>Of course, this level of personalization raises the stakes for privacy. To be the “friend” in the analogy, the AI needs to understand your context deeply, but that data must remain a private secret. The real opportunity is in <strong>zero-knowledge advertising</strong>, where an advertiser knows their ad was shown to the right person, but never knows who that person is or what they said to the AI. The proof of success will be found in ad performance, not data harvesting.</p><p>Ultimately, the success of this shift depends on one thing: OpenAI’s willingness to be rigorous enough to <strong>decide when not to show an ad</strong>. The business hunger for growth often leads platforms to flood every empty space with sponsored content. If OpenAI shows an ad just to collect the incentive, even when it doesn’t truly help the user, they become just another search engine. If they make it right, they can leverage the power of the ads as content.</p><p>There are broader challenges in the AI landscape that need to be addressed. Like any powerful technology, AI must be governed by priorities like safety and ethics. <strong>Safety concerns must always come first.</strong> It is only when all necessary guardrails are met, and the model identifies a clear and safe shopping intent, that a healthy advertisement ecosystem can exist.</p><p>This new paradigm opens a significant opportunity for ads to evolve from a <strong>tax on our attention</strong> into a <strong>service for our needs</strong>. A well-executed advertisement could be a win for everyone involved. We’re jumping into the <strong>next phase of human history</strong>, and yes, there will be ads. I don’t think anything will stop this change, so the best thing we can do is get it right by ensuring the value of the answer is never traded for the price of the ad. That’s what I’m hoping to happen.</p><p><strong><em>Rodrigo Osornio</em></strong><em> is a San Francisco-based product designer with training in visual arts and industrial design.

<figure><img alt=""A glasses with floating UI on it. AI-Generated image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RDWf03gEFMyyNtIVGJpa2g.jpeg"" /><figcaption>AI-generated image based on the original from this article <a href=""https://www.queppelin.com/ar-glasses-for-navigation/"">https://www.queppelin.com/ar-glasses-for-navigation/</a></figcaption></figure><p>When I talk about AR glasses, I don’t mean bulky headsets. I mean devices that look like regular eyewear capable of whispering information into your ear and displaying 3D content or flat panels overlaid on the real world.</p><p>This article is neither a validation of the technology nor a criticism, it is an objective personal look at what I see coming. Here are five reasons why I believe AR glasses will succeed and become mainstream, along with the consequences designers and users must face.</p><h3>1. Solving the “Kidnapped Body” problem</h3><figure><img alt=""An illustration of a woman looking at the phone. AI-Generated image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Kv1QO5wUplFqomrm1QmdGg.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Mobile devices demand a high physical price. They force us to look down, occupy our hands, and monopolize our attention. I call this the “kidnapped body” problem. We pay this price without thinking, but the implications are profound. It severs us from the physical world, blocking out views, people, and genuine connection.</p><p>We have even developed medical terms for this. “<a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11856789/"">Tech Neck</a>” describes the repetitive stress injury caused by constantly looking down at a screen. AR glasses may succeed because they liberate the body. They return our hands to us and, more importantly, they lift our chins. By allowing us to look up and ahead, they reintegrate us into the world. While they will for sure introduce new distractions, the shift from “head-down” to “heads-up” computing is a fundamental ergonomic correction that users will gravitate toward.</p><h3>2. The new, no-new device</h3><figure><img alt=""A woman smiling grabbing her glasses. AI-Generated image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zGXPyqrNH8iLmzgZrqIbKw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>In a gadget-saturated world, introducing a completely new device is risky. However, AR glasses have a secret weapon. They aren’t “new.” They are just glasses.</p><p>Global estimates suggest around <a href=""https://www.overnightglasses.com/eyewear-industry-statistics/#:~:text=Globally%2C%20at%20least%202.2%20billion,for%202023%20was%20$65.6%20billion."">4 billion people already wear glasses</a> for various reasons, with over <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/blindness-and-visual-impairment"">2.2 billion people having a near or distance vision impairment</a> according to the World Health Organization. The form factor is familiar, socially accepted, and worn daily. The friction to adoption is incredibly low compared to a VR headset. Much like the Apple Watch which sold 12 million units in its breakout year by leveraging the centuries-old habit of wearing wristwatches. As long as they look like iconic eyewear rather than tech hardware, they are primed for mass adoption.</p><h3>3. The Spatial Canvas (Escaping the Screen)</h3><figure><img alt=""An illustration of a busy street seen from the perspective of a person with AR glasses. The street is full of floating user interface. AI-Generated image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*a-BfGo5NIZp_uzQbQHmxCg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>AI-generated image based on the original from this article <a href=""https://www.crunchfish.com/how-does-the-world-look-through-smart-glasses/"">https://www.crunchfish.com/how-does-the-world-look-through-smart-glasses/</a></figcaption></figure><p>There is a multi-million-dollar industry currently trapped behind 6-inch glass rectangles. Tech giants from phone manufacturers to app developers are hitting the limits of what can be done on a 2D flat screen.</p><p>The physical world is a “green field” for these companies, a massive, unclaimed canvas for digital overlay. Whether we like it or not, the push to colonize our surroundings with digital content is the next logical growth engine for the tech sector.</p><p>For product designers, this represents the most significant paradigm shift ever seen. We are moving from designing within a constrained frame to designing without borders. Eventually, we will no longer design apps that “trap” users, we will design apps that enhance the environment. This shift to “Spatial Computing” will unlock entirely new economies and user behaviors that flat screens simply cannot support.</p><h3>4. Strong Use Cases</h3><figure><img alt=""A floating user interface seen from inside a car. AI-Generated image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dDpTz4QCVcDT2OR8tmirpA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>AI-generated image based on the original from this article <a href=""https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/envisics-ar-windshield-technology/"">https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/envisics-ar-windshield-technology/</a></figcaption></figure><p>The utility of placing digital objects into the physical world is undeniable. While current iterations act as a Heads-Up Display (HUD) rather than fully immersive AR, they are the necessary bridge to the future.</p><p>Apps designed for physical interaction will thrive first:</p><ul><li><strong>Exploration and Learning:</strong> This is perhaps the strongest long-term use case. You could stand in front of a historical monument and instantly see contextual history overlaid on the stone. You could look at a complex car engine and see step-by-step repair labels pointing to the exact parts you need to touch. It turns the entire world into an interactive learning manual.</li><li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Arrows overlaid on the street as you walk, allowing you to converse with friends without checking a phone map.</li><li><strong>Cooking:</strong> Hands-free recipes floating above the counter.</li><li><strong>Safety:</strong> The ability to livestream to emergency services instantly during dangerous situations could be a significant deterrent to crime.</li><li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> For users with disabilities, these glasses can provide real-time context, enhance visual contrast, or narrate the environment instantly empowering users without requiring active intervention.</li></ul><p>As product designers we can already start exploring how to design for AR glasses in Google’s documentation for instance, in this <a href=""https://design.google/library/transparent-screens"">article</a>, David Allan Reese talks about how to design with daylight, UI components sizes, contrast, space awareness and more. You can also take a look at how Google’s AR UI kit, <a href=""https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/jetpack-xr-sdk/jetpack-compose-glimmer"">Jetpack Compose Glimmer</a>, looks like. On the other hand, Meta has also released its <a href=""https://wearables.developer.meta.com/docs/develop"">documentation </a>about developing and designing for Ray-Ban Meta Glasses.</p><h3>5. Voice Interaction Made Natural</h3><figure><img alt=""An illustration of a woman with an AR glasses touching the right side of them simulating touching the volume. Some sound player UI floating next to the hand. AI-Generated image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mEhRbXCbvv-XrjkMYjF2kg.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Historically, conversational interfaces have suffered from poor reputations. They were often frustrating and limited. However, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has fundamentally changed this.</p><p>Conversational AI is becoming natural, instant, and context-aware very fast. When you combine competent AI with the “hands-free” nature of glasses, voice becomes a crucial input system. The social awkwardness of talking to a device will likely fade, much like how wearing wireless earbuds 24/7 went from “rude” to “normal.”</p><h3>The Consequences</h3><p>If this technology succeeds, we must be prepared for two major friction points, particularly from a design perspective:</p><p><strong>1. The Privacy Paradox</strong> Privacy concerns run in two directions. First, what are manufacturers capturing about our daily lives? Second, how do we manage peer-to-peer privacy? The “always-on” camera creates uneasiness in social environments. How will society regulate recording in public? Will hacking the “recording LED” become common? These social contracts will need to be rewritten, and many users may reject the tech simply to opt out of this surveillance state.</p><p><strong>2. Spatial Invasion and New UX Patterns</strong> If the world becomes a digital canvas, who owns the rights to that space? We risk a future of “spatial spam” ads anchored to physical storefronts, landmarks, or even sidewalks. Without strict regulation, the tranquility of the real world could be interrupted by pop-ups and notifications that we cannot swipe away.</p><p>For designers, this raises critical ethical questions. What is the “dark pattern” of spatial design? How do we design a safe mode mechanism for the real world? We may see the rise of aggressive attention-grabbing patterns that intentionally block your view. Designers will have the heavy responsibility of defining the etiquette of this new layer. Will we design respectful interfaces that blend in, or intrusive billboards that demand attention? We may not see the regulations put in place until after the intrusion has already begun.</p><h3>To wrap up</h3><p>AR glasses introduce a new reality, literally. They’ll bring with them as many opportunities as there are threads of concern. For product designers, the challenge is not just to be ahead of the trend, but to deeply understand what this technology adds to or subtracts from human life.</p><p>Personally, I am fascinated by a future enhanced by this technology, a life where reality is augmented to help and delight us. However, we have seen how initial excitement can turn into unforeseen consequences. Social media reminds us of how a tool for connection can evolve into a mental health crisis. By the time we realized the damage, it was already too late for some generations.</p><p>I believe in the power of individual common sense, but I also know that mass adoption shifts behavior in unpredictable ways. I hope this article has sparked your interest and encouraged you to investigate further. We are facing a fascinating technological horizon, and it is up to us, designers and users, to ensure it remains a tool for human enhancement rather than distraction.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=69fb46013816"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/5-reasons-why-ar-glasses-are-inevitable-69fb46013816"">5 Reasons why AR glasses are inevitable</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>AI doesn’t just reflect human bias. It amplifies it through everyday use, quietly shaping judgement, trust, and decisions.</h4><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a person from behind, holding a pen thoughtfully while reviewing two stacks of CVs on a wooden desk. One stack is labelled “AI” and the other “Colleague.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tIC7DvEr9qL6ZqaiHrcYcw.png"" /><figcaption>Image generated by author</figcaption></figure><p>You’re halfway through a stack of job applications, AI assistant humming along beside you, flagging promising candidates like an eager intern. It disagrees with your gut feeling about one applicant. You pause. Reconsider. A few screens later, it disagrees again. You change your mind once more. By the end of the session, you’ve deferred to its judgment on nearly a third of the decisions where you initially felt confident.</p><p>Now swap the algorithm for a colleague. Same stack, same disagreements. How often do you actually budge? Much less often, as it turns out.</p><p>This isn’t hypothetical hand-wringing. <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-02077-2"">Recent research</a> involving 1,401 participants found that <strong>when people disagree with AI, they change their minds 32% of the time. With other humans, that figure drops to 11%.</strong> That’s almost three times more influence from a machine than from another person. Quite something, given we’ve spent millennia learning to be sceptical of each other.</p><p>We like to think of ourselves as rational decision-makers who simply use these tools as helpful aids. The evidence tells a different story. They do more than support our thinking; they reshape it. And far more powerfully than human opinions ever could.</p><p>This raises a question that should keep designers up at night: if users are this susceptible to algorithmic persuasion, what happens when the model itself is biased?</p><p>The answer isn’t just that users make biased choices. The effect compounds. Through repeated interactions, small errors snowball into meaningful distortions. And in most cases, users never notice it happening.</p><figure><img alt=""An infographic showing two stacks of CVs: a tall stack labelled “AI Recommended” and a shorter stack labelled “Your Gut Feeling.” An arrow shows 32% of decisions shifting toward the AI pile.

The problem isn’t one-sided. It’s a two-way street, with both the AI and the human feeding into a loop that amplifies bias at every turn.</p><p>On the AI side, these systems don’t simply reflect the patterns in their training data. They tend to exaggerate them. Machine learning models are optimised to detect and reinforce patterns, which means subtle skews in the data often become stronger in the output.</p><p>A hiring algorithm trained on historical data where 70% of successful hires were men doesn’t just reproduce that 70/30 split. It learns to weight male candidates more heavily, nudging the bias further along. The system is simply doing what it was built to do: find patterns and double down on them.</p><p>But that’s only half of the picture.</p><h3>The human half of the equation</h3><p>We don’t treat AI recommendations the same way we treat advice from another person. We tend to see automated systems as more objective, more analytical. Somehow immune to the messy biases that plague human thinking. This perception gets reinforced by how AI is marketed (“trained on the sum of human knowledge”) and by our long-standing trust in technology for high-stakes decisions in healthcare and finance.</p><p><a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-02077-2"">Research from University College London and MIT</a> shows just how potent this combination can be. Across a series of experiments, participants interpreted facial expressions, motion perception, and other people’s performance. In each case, they interacted with AI systems that had been deliberately programmed with biases similar to those found in many real-world models.</p><p><strong>What happened next wasn’t just a momentary nudge.</strong> The distortion deepened. Through repeated interaction, small initial errors grew into significant skews. Participants who started with relatively minor biases ended up with significantly stronger ones. Largely because the AI amplified existing patterns while participants remained unusually receptive to its guidance.</p><p>Here’s where it gets uncomfortable: most participants had no idea how much the AI was shaping their judgement. When researchers told participants they were interacting with another person (while secretly using a machine), the effect weakened. Simply believing the source was human reduced how deeply the bias took hold.</p><figure><img alt=""Three-phase diagram showing bias persistence. Phase 1: Human and AI robot making decisions together, producing a skewed pattern of outputs. Phase 2: AI is removed, human continues working alone. Phase 3: Human alone still making the same skewed decisions, with a “bias stuck” label and a broken gear icon indicating the pattern has transferred to the human even without the AI present."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*I7183KuMBJ1-HEdXNNmGnQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p>Awareness mattered, but not in the way we might expect. Knowing that the advice came from an algorithm made people <em>more</em> susceptible, not less. <strong>We expect AI to be right, so we lower our guard.</strong> It’s the automation equivalent of assuming the smoke alarm would have gone off if there were a real fire.</p><p>Even more troubling: this effect doesn’t vanish when the AI does. <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-42384-8"">A 2023 study</a> had participants assess medical images (specifically, deciding whether skin spots were benign or potentially cancerous) using a deliberately biased algorithm.</p><p>When the system was removed, the bias stuck around. People continued making the same skewed calls on their own, having unconsciously absorbed its patterns into their decision-making. The higher someone’s self-reported trust in automation, the more their independent conclusions mimicked the machine’s errors.</p><h3>The path of least resistance</h3><p>Our vulnerability to AI isn’t just about trust in technology. It’s rooted in something rather unflattering about how our brains handle effort.</p><p><strong>Psychologists call this the <em>cognitive miser</em> effect. </strong>Thinking is expensive (metabolically, emotionally, and in terms of time) so when we’re handed an opportunity to reduce mental effort, we tend to grab it. These systems offer a particularly seductive shortcut: offloading complex judgement to something that appears faster, smarter, and more thorough than we could manage ourselves.</p><p>This helps explain why automation bias shows up so consistently. <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3240751/"">Studies show</a> that when people work with automated decision-support systems, they dial back their own monitoring and verification. <strong>The presence of AI doesn’t just influence decisions; it quietly changes how much effort we put into thinking at all.</strong></p><p>We see the recommendation, and it feels complete. The work appears to be done. On to the next thing.</p><figure><img alt=""Split illustration comparing cognitive load.

We also tend to believe that these tools have analytical abilities that surpass our own. In some domains, that belief is justified. They can crunch enormous datasets, spot patterns at scale, and perform calculations far beyond human capability.</p><p>The problem is that we extend this assumption into contexts where it doesn’t hold.</p><p>The fact that an algorithm can analyse thousands of medical images doesn’t mean its assessment about an individual patient is infallible. Just because a system can process every CV in a database doesn’t mean it grasps what makes a good hire in a specific team. The leap from “impressive at scale” to “trustworthy in specifics” is one we make far too readily.</p><h3>When trust spirals</h3><p><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3240751/"">The evidence on automation bias</a> shows that inexperience and low confidence amplify this effect. When people feel uncertain about their own abilities, or when they’re working under time pressure, they’re more likely to defer to the machine.</p><p>This creates a rather unhelpful loop. <strong>The more we rely on AI, the less we exercise our own judgement. The less confident we become, the more we rely on it.</strong> Keep that cycle spinning long enough, and your decision-making instincts start to gather dust.</p><p>Branding matters too. Studies have found that when users are told they’re working with an “expert system” rather than a basic algorithm, they’re more likely to follow its recommendations — even when those recommendations are wrong. How we label AI directly shapes how much trust users place in it.</p><p>There’s also what researchers call <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation_bias"">“learned carelessness”</a>. When these systems perform well over time, users gradually reduce their vigilance. High reliability leads to complacency. If the system has been right 95% of the time, we stop checking as carefully. And when it stumbles on that remaining 5%, we’re rarely prepared.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram of a downward spiral with four stages: “Defer to AI” at the top, followed by “Practice Own Judgement Less”, then “Confidence in Own Ability Drops”, and finally “Defer to AI Even More.” The spiral tightens and darkens as it descends into a vortex."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dUJ8BO0UjkYFStYuUgdqOA.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><h3>More than the sum of its parts</h3><p>For a long time, AI bias and human bias have been treated as separate problems with separate fixes. We try to clean up training data and fine-tune models. We train users to recognise their own blind spots and think more critically. Both approaches matter, but they miss something essential. What emerges from human–AI interaction isn’t simply one plus the other. It’s compound bias. Something new that arises specifically from the interplay between the two.</p><p>Think of it less like an equation and more like a chemical reaction. When certain elements combine, they don’t just sit alongside one another. They interact, producing something neither had before they met.</p><p><a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2504.18759v1"">A recent paper</a> makes exactly this argument. <strong>Bias doesn’t live solely in the model or in the user. It emerges dynamically through feedback loops that evolve over time, each party making the other a little worse with every exchange.</strong></p><p>Medical AI studies illustrate this clearly. In a <a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2511.14591v2"">2025 study</a>, researchers examined what happens when class imbalance in AI systems meets human base rate neglect.</p><p>Class imbalance is a technical bias where rare conditions are underrepresented in training data. Base rate neglect is a human cognitive bias where we struggle to reason accurately about low-probability events. Individually, each causes predictable problems.</p><p>Together, they produce something worse.</p><p><strong>Class imbalance throws off people’s ability to gauge how much they should trust the AI. Base rate neglect makes users more vulnerable to skewed outputs.</strong> Each bias reinforces the other, creating feedback loops that lead to poorer outcomes than either would cause alone.</p><p>The errors don’t add up. They multiply.</p><h3>Fixing the wrong problem</h3><p>This is why traditional debiasing strategies often fall short. You can scrub training data and tune algorithms all you like. But if the interaction pattern itself amplifies bias, you haven’t solved the problem. You’ve just trimmed one input to a system that compounds errors regardless.</p><p>The same goes for human-focused interventions. <strong>Teaching users about cognitive bias is valuable, but if the interface encourages offloading and discourages verification, that knowledge stays theoretical.</strong> Filed under “good to know” and rarely retrieved.</p><p>The question shifts. It’s not “is the AI biased?” Or even “are the users biased?” Instead, it goes: “does this interaction create bias amplification over time?”</p><p>That’s a fundamentally different design challenge.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WTzPaQG-Fs7yjFKMekYRLg.png"" /><figcaption>Image based on Caravaggio’s Narcissus (1597–1599)</figcaption></figure><h3>Mirror, mirror in the interface</h3><p>AI doesn’t just mirror our biases. It amplifies them. Quietly, incrementally, and often invisibly. The problem isn’t confined to training data or human psychology alone. It lives in the space between humans and machines, shaped by how each influences the other over repeated interaction.</p><p>For designers, this reframes what we’re solving for. We can’t simply debias algorithms and dust off our hands. We can’t rely solely on user education. <strong>The bias emerges from the interaction itself. From patterns of trust, deference, and cognitive offloading that compound with every exchange.</strong></p><p>Which brings us to the real question.</p><p>If this amplification happens through everyday interactions with AI, where is it already showing up most strongly in the products we use today?</p><p>The research points to a particular type of interface. One that feels natural, helpful, and conversational. In these interactions, users don’t just follow biased recommendations. They begin to internalise them, carrying those biases forward even after the interaction ends.</p><p>And that’s precisely what makes it so hard to see.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Thanks for reading! 📖</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote><em>If you liked this post, </em><a href=""https://medium.com/@doracee""><em>follow me on Medium</em></a><em> for more.</em></blockquote><h3>References &amp; Credits</h3><p>Glickman, M., &amp; Sharot, T.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960008.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings, you survived the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Aquarius Solar Eclipse</a> and the launch of the Year of the Fire Horse, and honestly… that was a lot. This week shifts the pace. We’re now fully <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">in Pisces Season</a>, and the assignment is simple but not easy: slow down. Go with the flow. Rest without guilt. Dream without immediately turning the dream into a five-step action plan. After last week’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/saturn-in-aries-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Saturn–Neptune conjunction</a>, many of you are receiving quiet downloads about where your energy actually belongs. Trust what’s coming through, even if it doesn’t look “productive” yet. Sitting with your feelings, journaling, meditating, or simply doing less is also progress. Pisces energy reminds us that clarity grows in still water.</p>



<p>On February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings the first reality check since the eclipse. First quarter moons tend to feel like roadblocks or tension points, moments where you realize that the intention you set now needs adjustment. Because this one is in Gemini, the medicine is flexibility. If something isn’t working, don’t double down out of stubbornness. Ask more questions. Look at the situation from another angle. Have the conversation. Pivot if needed. This is less about pushing harder and more about staying curious enough to find a smarter path forward.</p>



<p>Then on February 26th, Mercury shifts retrograde in Pisces, and the emotional weather gets… watery. Focus may feel slippery, timelines may blur, and your mind might drift into nostalgia, daydreams, or full cinematic flashbacks from the past. Miscommunications are possible, especially when feelings are implied instead of spoken clearly. But this retrograde has a gift: it’s powerful for emotional closure, forgiveness, creative reflection, and tying up loose ends your intuition already knows about. People from the past may resurface, memories may stir, and old feelings may ask for acknowledgment. Just remember: feel everything, but stay grounded. Not every emotion is a crisis… sometimes it’s just your heart clearing space for what’s next.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, this week feels like the emotional cool down after being spiritually and energetically “on stage” for most of the month. With the Saturn–Neptune conjunction freshly behind you, you may still be processing major identity downloads… who you are now, what you’re ready to commit to, and what version of you is officially retired. The first full week <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">of Pisces Season</a> asks you to move slower than usual, even if your instinct is to charge forward.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini may bring a mental speed bump… a conversation, decision, or piece of information that makes you rethink your next move. Don’t treat this as a setback. Gemini energy is about adjusting your approach, asking questions, and staying flexible rather than forcing clarity too quickly.</p>



<p>The tone turns even more inward on February 26th, when Mercury begins its retrograde in Pisces, activating your realm of healing, rest, and spiritual closure. As February wraps up, you may feel more introspective, nostalgic, or emotionally sensitive than usual. Old memories, dreams, or unresolved feelings could surface, not to overwhelm you, but to be released. This is a powerful time to unplug, journal, meditate, and tie up emotional loose ends rather than pushing new plans forward. After a month of intense visibility and transformation, the real alignment now comes from solitude and softness. Think of this as your energetic reset before your season arrives.</p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, the first full week <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">of Pisces Season</a> shifts your focus toward connection, community, and your long-term vision for the future. You may feel more emotionally attuned to your friendships, social circles, or online spaces, noticing who feels aligned with the person you’re becoming and who doesn’t quite match your energy anymore. This is a softer, more heart-centered time for collaboration and dreaming with others.</p>



<p>However, on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini activates your money and self-worth zone, bringing a potential reality check around finances, pricing your value, or how much energy you’re giving compared to what you’re receiving. If a small obstacle shows up, don’t panic. Gemini energy asks you to stay flexible, explore options, and adjust your strategy rather than taking it personally.</p>



<p>Things may feel a bit more fluid and unpredictable starting February 26th, when Mercury goes retrograde in Pisces for three weeks. Miscommunications with friends, shifting group dynamics, or social media and tech hiccups are possible. You might even feel the urge to step back from certain platforms or take a break from being constantly available. This retrograde isn’t here to disrupt your peace, it’s here to help you reassess where your energy truly belongs. If plans change or connections feel unclear, resist the urge to control every outcome. Some things are meant to realign on their own. Your job is simply to stay grounded in your values and let the right circles reveal themselves.</p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, the first full week <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">of Pisces Season</a> puts your career, reputation, and long-term direction in the spotlight, but in a softer, more reflective way than you might expect. You may feel more emotionally connected to your work, questioning whether your current path actually aligns with your purpose, not just your skills.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in your sign brings a personal checkpoint. This can feel like a moment of pressure, a decision point, or a sudden realization about how you’re showing up professionally and personally. If something feels like a roadblock, don’t rush to push through it. This is Gemini energy at its best when you pause, gather more information, and adjust your approach rather than forcing a single outcome.</p>



<p>The tone shifts on February 26th, when your ruling planet Mercury shifts retrograde in Pisces. As February wraps up, you may find yourself rethinking a professional goal, reconsidering a public role, or feeling the need to slow down rather than chase the next opportunity. This isn’t the ideal time to launch brand new pitches, apply impulsively for roles, or make major career commitments unless the process began before the retrograde. Instead, think of this as a strategic review period. You’re refining your trajectory, not falling behind. The more honest you are about what success actually looks like for you now, the clearer your next move will be when Mercury moves forward again.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955474.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cancer, as a moon-ruled sign, you’re still feeling the energetic aftershocks of last week’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Aquarius solar eclipse</a> more strongly than most. Eclipses tend to activate your emotional radar, and you may be entering this week feeling heightened, reflective, or aware that something internally has shifted. Now that the cosmic intensity is settling, the first full week of Pisces Season offers a welcome emotional flow. Pisces energy supports your growth, faith, and long-term vision, helping you reconnect with hope after a period of major internal processing.</p>



<p>That sense of forward momentum meets a checkpoint on February 24th, when the First Quarter Moon in Gemini activates your rest, closure, and mental health zone. This can feel like a temporary pause or emotional speed bump, especially if you’ve been pushing yourself to “figure everything out.” You may need more sleep, quiet time, or space away from noise and expectations. Gemini energy here isn’t asking you to solve anything immediately, it’s encouraging you to listen to your inner dialogue and release mental clutter before taking your next step.</p>



<p>The pace shifts further inward on February 26th, when Mercury begins its retrograde in Pisces in your expansion realm for the next three weeks. Plans related to travel, education, publishing, entrepreneurship, or big-picture goals may need to be revisited, delayed, or adjusted. Instead of forcing new launches or committing to major long-term decisions, use this time to refine your vision. You may rediscover an old idea, reconnect with a previous opportunity, or realize your direction needs a slight pivot. This retrograde isn’t blocking your growth, it’s making sure your next leap is aligned with who you’re becoming.</p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, you’re entering this week still processing the emotional intensity <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">of the recent eclipse</a>, and you may feel more aware than usual of your deeper needs and boundaries. The first full week of Pisces Season activates your intimacy, healing, and shared resources zone, pulling your focus beneath the surface. This energy asks you to slow down and get honest about emotional exchanges, financial entanglements, or situations where you’ve been giving more power away than you realized.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a social checkpoint. A conversation with friends, a group dynamic, or a long-term goal may require adjustment. If plans shift or people show you new sides of themselves, stay flexible. Gemini energy here is about recalibrating your network so it reflects where you’re actually headed.</p>



<p>As February winds down, the tone turns even more reflective. On February 26th, Mercury starts its retrograde in Pisces for the next three weeks. You may need to revisit agreements around money, boundaries, or expectations in close relationships. Old feelings could resurface, or past connections may reappear for closure. This isn’t the time to make major financial commitments or merge resources impulsively. Instead, think of this period as emotional and energetic bookkeeping. The more honest you are now about what you share, what you owe, and what you need, the stronger your foundation will be moving forward.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Virgo, this week is all about relationships, reflections, and recalibrating how you show up with others. The first full week <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">of Pisces Season</a> activates your partnership realm, putting the spotlight on one-on-one dynamics in love, business, and close collaborations. You may feel more emotionally attuned to others’ needs, but also more aware of where the balance feels off.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a reality check around your career or public direction. A professional conversation, decision, or expectation could create temporary pressure that spills into your personal life. Gemini energy asks you to stay adaptable and communicate clearly rather than assuming you have to carry everything alone.</p>



<p>Things get more personal on February 26th, when your ruling planet Mercury shifts retrograde in Pisces for the next three weeks. Because Mercury governs you, you’ll feel this shift more strongly than most. Miscommunications, mixed signals, or unresolved dynamics with partners may surface, not to create chaos, but to be addressed honestly. This isn’t the best time to rush into new relationship commitments, sign major contracts, or make emotional ultimatums. Instead, think of this as a relationship review period: old conversations may resurface, past partners could reappear, or you may simply see a current dynamic more clearly. The more patient and transparent you are now, the stronger and more balanced your connections will become.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Libra, you may still be feeling the emotional weight of last week’s Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries, which activated your partnership realm in a major way. Big realizations about commitment, boundaries, or the reality of certain relationships are still settling in. This week isn’t about making dramatic moves, it’s about integrating what you’ve learned and giving yourself space to process how your relationship patterns are evolving.</p>



<p>The first <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">full week of Pisces Season</a> shifts your attention toward your daily life, work rhythms, and overall well-being. This is a softer, more intuitive period for adjusting your schedule so it actually supports your energy. Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini may bring a mental or logistical speed bump around travel plans, learning, or a long-term goal. Stay flexible and open to changing your approach rather than pushing for immediate clarity.</p>



<p>As February winds down, Mercury goes retrograde in Pisces on February 26th for the next three weeks. Expect shifts in your schedule, workplace miscommunications, or a need to revisit health habits and boundaries around how much you’re taking on. This is less about being perfectly productive and more about creating systems that are sustainable. Small adjustments now will make a big difference once Mercury moves forward again.</p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, after the emotional shakeup of last week’s Aquarius solar eclipse, this first full week <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">of Pisces Season</a> feels like a welcome exhale. That eclipse squared Uranus in your partnership realm, bringing unexpected shifts or truths in relationships that may have felt destabilizing in the moment, but ultimately freeing. Now, Pisces energy helps you soften. This is your zone of romance, creativity, joy, and inner child healing, inviting you to date yourself, say yes to what feels fun again, and allow love to flow both ways. You may notice your mood lifting, your creativity returning, and your desire for play coming back online. Let this be a lighter week… you’ve earned it.</p>



<p>On February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a practical checkpoint around shared finances, debts, or long-term wealth planning. This could surface as a small speed bump or reality check, but Gemini energy keeps the tone lighter than usual. Instead of spiraling, approach your situation with curiosity and even a little humor. This is a good time to explore multiple income streams or rethink how you’re managing resources, just be mindful not to overcommit or take on more than you can realistically handle.</p>



<p>As February wraps up, Mercury begins its retrograde in Pisces on February 26th, also in your romance and creativity zone. Over the next three weeks, nostalgia may hit hard. Old flames, familiar dynamics, or rose-colored memories could resurface, making the past look sweeter than it actually was. Stay grounded. This retrograde is less about rekindling old patterns and more about healing them. Use this time for rest, creative reflection, and reconnecting with the version of you that feels playful, expressive, and emotionally safe.</p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, the first full <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">week of Pisces Season</a> pulls your focus inward toward home, family, and your emotional foundation. After the intensity and movement of the past few weeks, this energy asks you to slow down and tend to your inner world. You may feel the urge to nest, rest, or spend more time with the people and spaces that make you feel safe. Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a relationship checkpoint. A conversation, decision, or difference in perspective could surface with a partner or close collaborator. Gemini energy here isn’t about conflict, it’s about communication. Stay curious, ask questions, and avoid jumping to conclusions.</p>



<p>As February winds down, Mercury shifts retrograde in Pisces on February 26th for the next three weeks. Plans around living situations, family matters, or domestic routines may shift, or old memories and feelings could resurface. This isn’t the time to rush major moves or make permanent decisions about your living environment unless the process began earlier. Instead, use this period to reorganize your space, revisit emotional boundaries, and create a home life that actually supports your energy. Slowing down now will give you the stability you’ll need for the momentum ahead.</p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the first full <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">week of Pisces Season</a> shifts your focus toward communication, learning, and the conversations shaping your day-to-day life. You may feel more reflective than usual, noticing how your words, thoughts, and mental habits are affecting your energy. This is a softer, more intuitive time for writing, brainstorming, or having heart-centered conversations.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a practical checkpoint around your work routines, responsibilities, or health habits. A small scheduling issue, workload adjustment, or energy dip could surface. Gemini energy asks you to stay flexible and tweak your systems rather than pushing yourself harder.</p>



<p>As February wraps up, Mercury begins its retrograde in Pisces for the next three weeks. Expect delays, crossed wires, or the need to revisit conversations, paperwork, or short-term plans. This isn’t the best time to rush contracts, announcements, or major decisions unless they’ve been in motion already. Instead, use this period to edit, review, and clarify. Slowing down your pace and double-checking details now will save you time and stress once Mercury moves forward again.</p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, after such a personal and intense stretch, the first full <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">week of Pisces Season</a> shifts your focus toward grounding and rebuilding your sense of stability. This energy activates your money, self-worth, and values zone, encouraging you to slow down and get clear about what actually feels sustainable. You may find yourself reassessing where your time and energy are going and whether the return feels aligned.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a creative or emotional checkpoint. Something related to dating, a passion project, or how you’re expressing yourself may need a small adjustment. Gemini energy asks you to stay playful and flexible rather than taking the moment too seriously.</p>



<p>As February comes to a close, Mercury begins its retrograde in Pisces in your financial and self-esteem sector for the next three weeks. Payments, budgeting plans, or income conversations may shift or require review. This isn’t the time for major financial risks or impulsive purchases unless they were already planned. Instead, use this period to reassess your spending, renegotiate your value, and reconnect with what actually makes you feel secure. Slow and intentional moves now will help you build a stronger foundation moving forward.</p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, this first full week <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">of your solar return season</a> puts you back at the center of your own story. After the intensity and collective shifts of the past few weeks, the energy now asks you to move at your pace, not the world’s. You may feel more sensitive, intuitive, and aware of what your body and emotions actually need.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a checkpoint around home, family, or your emotional foundation. A conversation, scheduling shift, or small tension in your living environment may require flexibility. Gemini energy here is a reminder to stay adaptable and communicate rather than internalize everything.</p>



<p>Things turn even more introspective on February 26th, when Mercury begins its three-week retrograde in your sign. Since this is happening in your identity and personal expression zone, you may feel more reflective, nostalgic, or uncertain about how you want to show up. Old versions of yourself, past decisions, or unfinished emotional stories could resurface. This isn’t the time to rush major reinventions or make bold personal announcements. Instead, treat this as a personal reset. Journal, rest, revisit your intentions, and let clarity come back to you naturally. The more gentle and honest you are with yourself now, the more aligned your next chapter will feel.</p>

<p><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/10/11938298/bridgerton-season-4-details-cast-love-story-characters"">Bridgerton’s</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/10/11938298/bridgerton-season-4-details-cast-love-story-characters""> Yerin Ha</a> is currently <em>everywhere</em>. While we have been fans of the Korean-Australian actor since <em>Halo</em> and <em>Bad Behaviour</em>, her breakout role in <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/10/11938163/bridgerton-season-4-details-cast-love-story-characters"">Bridgerton</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/10/11938163/bridgerton-season-4-details-cast-love-story-characters""> Season 4</a> as Sophie Baek has put her on the map worldwide. As the first <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2022/03/10896653/asian-australian-women-online-communities"">East Asian</a> to lead the Regency romance drama, she continues to break boundaries and offer representation for those less seen on screen.</p>



<p>As a rising star, Ha has also been hand-picked by SAG-AFTRA to become the Ambassador for <a href=""https://www.actorawards.org/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Actor Awards</a>, which will air live on March 2. The star will be sharing behind-the-scenes content and participating in multiple pre-show events.</p>



<p>“Being named The Actor Awards Ambassador is such an honor because this ceremony is about actors celebrating actors,” Ha said. “There is something uniquely powerful about being recognised within your own community. As someone who cares so deeply about the craft and about collaboration, it means so much to represent the next generation of actors and be part of an event that uplifts storytelling.”</p>

<p>Ha follows in the footsteps of previous SAG-AFTRA Ambassadors such as Sofia Carson, Haley Lu Richardson, Antonia Gentry and Alexandra Daddario.</p>



<p>The <em>Bridgerton </em>star was most recently seen at Gold House’s Lunar New Year party, where <a href=""https://people.com/bridgerton-yerin-ha-says-former-leads-simone-ashley-and-nicola-coughlan-have-been-lovely-and-supportive-exclusive-11681027"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">she opened up to </a><em><a href=""https://people.com/bridgerton-yerin-ha-says-former-leads-simone-ashley-and-nicola-coughlan-have-been-lovely-and-supportive-exclusive-11681027"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">People</a></em> about East-Asian representation on screen. “It’s been really, really amazing and beautiful. I mean, I’ve been really caught up with the [<em>Bridgerton</em>] press tour, so I don’t think I’ve been too [online], Ha said. “It has been really positive and I just feel so proud that I get to be the face of that and keep advocating for change, and knowing that we deserve these roles and spaces.”</p>



<p><em>Bridgerton</em> Season 4 Part 2 will be released on February 26, and will see Ha’s Sophie (hopefully) win Benedict’s heart and become a true leading lady. In a time where the world can seem overwhelming, it’s lovely to be able to celebrate Ha and her successes.</p>

<p>My feed has been completely taken over by fans lamenting that they haven’t been able to secure <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/05/9781230/hilary-duff-kids-luca-banks-mom-advice-media"">Hilary Duff</a> tickets for <a href=""https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a70327671/how-to-buy-hilary-duff-the-lucky-me-tour-tickets/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Lucky Me Tour</a>. From people sliding into the pop star’s DMs to beg her to add more dates, to countless memes and TikToks from those who missed out, it’s clear that <a href=""https://lifestyle.si.com/news/hilary-duff-pens-love-letter-to-fans-following-new-album-release"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hilary Duff fever</a> has landed. During the first Mastercard pre-sale in Australia where I live, there were over 50,000 fans in the queue. Aside from the fact that Duff hasn’t toured here for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/ipod-noughties-tech-nostalgia"">18 years</a>, the demand could tie into this interesting trend of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/gen-z-nostalgia-millennial-experience"">pop culture selling nostalgia</a> — a sure-fire way to tap into already established audiences. </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/apr/28/that-yearning-feeling-why-we-need-nostalgia"">According to psychologists</a>, nostalgia is a powerful tool. It has the ability to increase self-esteem, help people form social bonds, soothe anxiety, boredom and stress, as well as being positive for your mental health. One fan tells me a <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15562273/Hilary-Duff-tour-fans-engaged-las-vegas.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">connection with Hilary Duff</a> transports her back to when times felt safer and easier. “They weren’t lying when they said ‘don’t grow up’. I was really lucky growing up, I had a beautiful childhood, with a big family, everything was simple back then and the world felt beautiful and full of colour,” fan Sakara Bell says. “I’ll never forget the Christmas when I unwrapped her album <em>Most Wanted</em>. I played <em>Beat Of My Heart </em>on repeat for months and never got tired of it.”</p>



<p>Anita Tran, who was lucky enough to purchase tickets, says nostalgia is “powerful” right now. “It transports me back to when my biggest worry was whether I’d make it back home in time to watch my favourite Disney Channel shows. A time where my first crush was <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7530306456667622687"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chad Michael Murray</a> in <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/01/10259591/one-tree-hill-james-lafferty-now-engaged-career"">One Tree Hill</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/01/10259591/one-tree-hill-james-lafferty-now-engaged-career""> </a>or I first understood what love meant watching <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2021/09/10678647/best-2000s-tv-shows-teens"">Dawson’s Creek</a></em>. It’s sweet, it’s innocent, and it’s just safe,” Tran adds. “Hilary is my childhood. <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"">She takes me back to my youth, where a cartoon <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lizzie-mcguire-hair-makeup"">Lizzie McGuire</a> </em>narrated my exact teenage thoughts, and <em>Metamorphosis </em>was the album my besties and I blasted on the way home from school</span>.” Other fans echoed the same sentiment, with one wanting to “heal her inner teen”, and another says Duff “genuinely influenced her personality as a child”. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Being able to experience something that is your childhood, is everything and more.</p><cite>Sakara Bell, Hilary Duff Fan</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Duff’s triumphant return to pop music is not only a reclaiming of her story, and finally being able to write the music <em>she always wanted to write</em>, but it ties into a larger theme of how we’re seeing the world. The <a href=""https://dictionary.apa.org/nostalgia"">definition of nostalgia</a> is wanting to return to a time of life where things seemed better than the present, and with the current political climate, consumers are more desperate for nostalgia than ever. With an ongoing <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/palestine-mothers-children-gaza-solidarity"">genocide in Gaza</a>, <a href=""https://psychology.org.au/insights/the-australian-women-dreading-change-in-trump%E2%80%99s-am"">Trump rolling back women’s rights</a>, and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2026/02/11959006/celebrity-political-statements-grammys-super-bowl"">issues of ICE in the USA</a>, it seems almost impossible to go through life without being faced with a new horrific truth. Shared nostalgia gives us an escape, where we can come together and bond as a community. </p>



<p>It’s no surprise that brands have commodified nostalgia. If you were wondering why there have been endless amounts of reboots (did we <em>really</em> need <em>Zoey 102</em>?), and beloved childhood toys like <em>Barbie</em> getting the big-screen treatment, there’s a reason. <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/41/3/713/2907535"">Research shows</a> that nostalgia can “decrease people’s desire for money”. People are more willing to open their wallets and pay more for products. <em><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/4JlqOqhImVEFmH4ue7GbVH"">Culture Club</a> </em>co-host and writer Jasmine Wallis agrees, believing that while she loves nostalgia, a big part of it is capitalism. “Millenials and older Gen Z’s (like Hilary’s fans) are entering adulthood in a really tough economy. So, while having kids and buying a house feels like a huge struggle and sacrifice, attending concerts like Hilary’s can offer a sense of joy for just $200,” Wallis says. “It takes us back to childhood whilst also offering a reprieve from adulthood. Executives and corporations know this and so are playing into it.” Duff fan Sakara Bell is aware of this marketing tactic, but it doesn’t turn her off at all. “I don’t really care. As cringy as it is, you only live once, and I’m a big believer in money comes and goes,” Bell says. “Being able to experience something that is your childhood, is everything and more.” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>It takes us back to childhood whilst also offering a reprieve from adulthood. Executives and corporations know this and so are playing into it.</p><cite>Jasmine Wallis, co-host and writer of culture club</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Nostalgia isn’t even exclusive to your own childhood, either. <a href=""https://theharrispoll.com/briefs/millennials-lead-american-optimism-for-the-future/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Even Gen Z are tapping into nostalgia</a> for the 1990s, including those who weren’t alive at the time. The pre-digital era is coveted by those who believe we’re spending too long doomscrolling. According to a study in the US, two-thirds of Gen Z adults wished to return to a world before we were all “plugged in”. </p>



<p>Perhaps that’s why Hilary Duff has completely taken over in Australia. It’s about more than just her hits (but she has great bops, to be fair), and more about society and how we yearn for a simpler, kinder time in life. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960290.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>When I say I’ve watched the rise and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/body-inclusivity-in-fashion-2025"">fall of size inclusion</a> at <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/search?q=nyfw"">New York Fashion Week</a>, I really mean it. <br /><br />I was at the runway of <em>the</em> first plus-size designer on the official NYFW calendar (Eden Miller’s Cabiria, showing at Mercedes Benz Fashion Week back in 2013). A year later, I was there when <a href=""https://www.elle.com/fashion/a45139956/plus-size-new-york-fashion-week/"">Chromat opened their SS15 show with plus model Denise Bidot</a> — and I made a very un-fashion-week-like exclamation of excitement when I saw her step onto the runway. I saw Christian Siriano go from a straight size designer to a plus fashion collab with Lane Bryant, to dressing plus celebrities for the red carpet, to becoming one of the designers known for dressing <em>every</em> body once he normalized <a href=""https://www.glamour.com/story/5-plus-size-models-just-walked-in-christian-sirianos-fashion-show"">including multiple plus models on the runway in 2016</a>.<br /><br />For a glorious while, it felt like progress was inevitable and the number of plus models walking NYFW would just keep going up… and then the pandemic hit. And then <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/body-positivity-movement-fat-black-women-weight-loss"">the rise of Ozempic</a> for weight loss hit. And suddenly, progress hadn’t just ground to a halt — we were going backwards. <br /><br />As someone who has been <a href=""https://www.elle.com/elleextra/events/a46688773/fashioning-a-more-size-inclusive-nyfw-panel-discussion/"">pushing for size inclusion in fashion</a> for over a decade, it is beyond disheartening to see the tiny bit of hard-fought progress we made being pushed back so rapidly. I’ve loved fashion since I was a little kid (I was the 5 year-old seeking out copies of <em>Vogue</em> and <em>Elle</em> at the local library), and I still get a thrill from covering NYFW even after a decade plus of doing so. But sometimes I look at the CFDA calendar before a season starts and feel my anxiety rising, because I just know there probably will be little to no size diversity to come. <br /><br />That bad-gut feeling was sadly correct this season. The official numbers aren’t in yet, but this might have been one of the least size diverse New York Fashion Weeks in recent history — and that bar is <em>low</em>.<br /><br />Now, some of this season’s dip can be attributed to certain brands sitting the season out. Last season, I saw the bulk of visibly plus size representation at plus-specific shows like<a href=""https://www.reneecafaroatelier.com/""> Renee Cafaro Atelier</a> and plus fashion label <a href=""https://www.eloquii.com/"">Eloquii</a>’s NYFW debut. Size inclusive designers like <a href=""https://rachelantonoff.com/"">Rachel Antonoff</a> and Kimberly Gordon of <a href=""https://selkiecollection.com/"">Selkie</a> can always be counted on for truly diverse runways too, but neither showed this season. <a href=""https://www.alexisbittar.com/"">Alexis Bittar</a> is another designer that I always find casts without discriminating against larger bodies (last season’s pageant-themed presentation was filled with dolls of every size), but this year’s visceral, violent, and excellent vignette just included one model (and one victim), so size diversity wasn’t applicable this time around. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p><strong>But all that just highlights the fact that it shouldn’t be on a handful of designers to carry all of the representation at Fashion Week. Because when they change their format or skip a season, the absence is keenly felt. </strong></p><cite>Sarah Chiwaya</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>These feelings are <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/fashion/skinny-models-ozempic-glp1.html"">supported by the data</a>: We’ve not yet seen the numbers from this season, but last season the representation was insignificant, with less than 1% plus models on the runway, and 97.1% of models sizes 0-4. Given that the average U.S. size is closer to a 16/18 (and <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm"">recent CDC data</a> shows that that size is holding true even after years of aggressive marketing of GLP-1s for weight loss), that is nothing short of abysmal. <br /><br />To be clear, we’ve never approached anything even CLOSE to equitable runway representation (which would mean at least 67% curve models). Indeed, we’ve barely even cracked 5% — and that’s with the most generous calculations. Tokenization, which is not real representation, has often been the norm over the last decade, but there’s nothing like seeing <em>zero</em> curves on the runway to put the absence of even that little bit of size diversity into sharp relief. <br /><br />I wasn’t alone in feeling it, either. Bella Gerard, a fashion editor and author of <a href=""https://bellagerard.substack.com/"">Substack’s B List</a>, also noted the blatant regression: “Above all else, the lack of body diversity on the runway this season just feels so…disappointing,” she noted. “It’s not breaking news that attempts at inclusivity are often performative in the fashion sphere, but this season really proved a ‘one step forward, three steps back’ reality. Not only was there next to no curve representation, but the straight size models looked even thinner than in recent years, calling back to an era of thinspo I thought we’d collectively renounced and evolved past.” </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960212.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>

<p>Fortunately, there were some bright points this season too, with top designers whose visions of fashion were not constrained to just one type of girl. On the first day of shows, <a href=""https://collinastrada.com/"">Collina Strada</a> showed a deliciously darkly romantic-yet-eclectic collection, replete with high <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/09/11778397/beetlejuice-beetlejuice-fashion-costumes"">Victorian lace collars</a>, blurred prints, volume play, and body baring dropped-waist silk dresses that looked equally hot on straight and plus size models. Later that evening, <a href=""https://www.jane-wade.com/"">Jane Wade</a>’s show — titled “The Summit” — was an innovative fashion expedition, with conifers on the runway, tents on dresses (and <em>as</em> dresses), and survival-ready fabrications merged with Wade’s signature suiting and elevated officewear. (The story of a corporate woman dreaming of an escape to nature is crucially not one limited by size.)<br /><br />And at New York Men’s Day, <a href=""https://www.a-potts.com/"">A.Potts</a> showed a distinctive style of oversized, genderless clothing on a cast that included both age diversity and an even more underrepresented category: Male plus models. Designer Aaron Potts is no stranger to size diverse casting, either: Prior seasons have included plus models, and I — a size 20 — was actually one of the models for the launch of his new diffusion label Werkshop by A.Potts (which was also featured in his NYMD presentation). <br /><br />I allowed myself a little hope after that good first day, but as the week went on and I saw more shows with <em>zero</em> curve models than not, the lack of size inclusion just felt more and more pronounced. Industry friends who knew I was reporting on size inclusion this season would occasionally text me curve model sightings. “Paloma on the runway at Proenza.” “One curve model at Gabe Gordon.” “I think two? at Eckhaus Latta.” Every message was appreciated, but the underlying implication that we needed to be eagle-eyed to spot even a smidgeon of size inclusion was a downer. <br /><br />Then there were the false positives, driven by the emerging trend of adding mass to thin bodies with clothing. I saw countless peplums, panniers, and padded pieces throughout the week, and as I was desperately searching for a hint of curve and trying to parse a tall size 8 curve model from her size 4 contemporary, I occasionally got excited only to realize that was just a straight size model with fabric curves added on. It felt like I was playing an unwitting (and unwelcome) game of “curve model or just a structured hip?” When there’s so little visual difference between straight and curve models — who do not typically wear <em>actual</em> plus sizes, paradoxically — the facade of inclusion shatters even more.</p>

<p>Shows with organic diversity, like <a href=""https://kimshui.net/"">Kim Shui</a>’s richly textured, color-forward FW26 show, were some of the bright points of the season, but were sadly the exceptions, not the rule. Age diversity did seem to be on the uptick, too — with gorgeous older models in shows including <a href=""https://www.carolinaherrera.com/us/en/"">Carolina Herrera</a>, <a href=""https://diotima.world/"">Diotima</a>, and the relaunch of <a href=""https://dereklam.com/"">Derek Lam</a> with new creative director Robert Rodriguez at the helm.</p>

<p>As someone with 25 seasons of NYFW under my belt and who has dedicated my career to the push for more and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wray-closing-plus-size-community-impact"">better for plus size women</a>, I am always wary when there’s a category that seems like the chosen diversity <em>du jour. </em>True representation should be across the board and not a passing trend, with an ongoing emphasis on making sure underrepresented groups can see themselves in fashion. I’ve obviously clocked this, but other fashion industry vets have noted it as well. <br /><br />In <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/fashion/skinny-models-ozempic-glp1.html"">a recent piece for the <em>New York Times</em></a>, top fashion critic Vanessa Friedman noted that the recent shift extends well beyond the catwalk: “The gravitational pull is toward an ever-shrinking human form, especially on the runway,” she wrote. “It’s too bad. Not because skinniness is bad, but because it should not be the only option. People still come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. Seeing the reality of life reflected on the runways, which have become a form of entertainment for everyone, is actually more appealing than seeing life reduced to one size that cannot fit all.<br /><br />Designers who really understand that appeal also know that it’s good for their bottom line. Committing to size inclusivity isn’t just the ethical thing to do — it’s good business sense, too. Take Christian Siriano, who <a href=""https://www.elle.com/fashion/celebrity-style/a21529009/christian-siriano-tripled-his-business-by-adding-plus-sizes/"">extolled the fiscal virtues of size inclusion back in 2018</a>, saying: “Adding plus sizes to my line tripled my business. Why wouldn’t you do that?!” <br /><br />This season, when asked about diversity in casting, he echoed that sentiment, exclaiming that it was “so important!” Last week, the designer punctuated this belief visually by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DU659FZiSdq/"">sending the same silhouette down the runway on two different body types</a>. “I love how you can see they look amazing in the same dress, in the same look,” he told me backstage. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960215.jpg?width=854&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=427%3A512"" /></figure></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960216.jpg?width=854&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=427%3A512"" /></figure></div>



<p>When designers approach representation as part of their brand identity, it effortlessly translates to the audience. Both legendary R&amp;B singer Monica and <em>the </em>Whoopi Goldberg independently praised Siriano’s commitment to making fashion for all backstage. “It was absolute elegance, and it was for every size, shape, color and creed, so many different types of women — and men! — in the show,” Monica noted. “Gives you all sorts of inspiration!” Goldberg summed it up even more succinctly: “Christian’s work just always inspires me and makes me so happy, because we can all wear it.”<br /><br />That type of organic inclusion was also evident in <a href=""https://chukscollins.com/"">Chuks Collins</a>’s striking presentation, which ranged from lush topstitched knits to sharp suits to stunning structured ballgowns, all shown on a range of sizes and body types. (Collins was heavily influenced by how scarification, purposeful, ritual, and otherwise, can play into the way we present ourselves to the world.)<br /><br />“I grew up seeing people that look like you, people that look like me,” Collins said. “My mom is not a size 2. My grandmother, who taught me to sew, she’s not a size 10. About 40 to 50% of my clients are plus size people. So I am not going to lie to myself and say ‘oh, my demographic, my ideal demographic is a size 2 to 4.’”<br /><br />For Collins, who started the brand in 2006, building a collection for customers of all sizes is both a labor of love and a practical financial matter — after all, he’s building a label he wants to last. “I have to create clothes that people see themselves in, that they want to wear. With that, I’m becoming a successful business,” he noted. “I also just love dressing people with curves, because that’s what I started doing, that’s how I started my career. So I’m not going to — because of what, industry standards? — I’m not going to include that? And I love women. I love beautiful women with curves. I tell the stories of how I feel, and my work is a representation of myself.” <br /><br />In the end, an outsized portion of the size diversity this season came from emerging designers and those making their CFDA debuts, such as Menyelek Rose of the eponymous label <a href=""https://www.menyelek.online/"">Menyelek</a>. Designer <a href=""https://www.andrewcurwen.com/home"">Andrew Curwen</a>, meanwhile, showed a sexy, directional, and haunting (complimentary!) collection. “Nocturnal Conditions” looked stunning on every figure, and the diverse cast (by F10 Casting agency) felt simultaneously natural and intentional. <br /><br />Camryn Mcclain of <a href=""https://reneenyc.com/"">RENÉE NYC</a> also cited body diversity as integral to her inspiration: “For casting this season, we focused on different characters of everyday people of various shapes and sizes that reflect what I see in the city,” Mcclain said. That thoughtfulness complemented a presentation of some of the most interesting knitwear I’ve seen lately, with bold braiding and fringe details rendered in rich jewel tones and gilded neutrals. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960219.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>

<p>“I want my collection to inspire and be inclusive for everyone,” said <a href=""https://veejayfloresca.com/"">Veejay Floresca</a>, another designer on the CFDA calendar for the first time. “I worked with my team to cast models across sizes, races, ages, and gender identities so that everyone can see themselves in the collection I created. It is so important to me that everyone feels beautiful and can express themselves freely and I hope my collection can bring this to all of my customers.” <br /><br />The casting fully reflected that, with a stunning range of bodies (including <em>Project Runway</em> star plus model Liris Crosse) all looking occasion-ready in sumptuous gowns and suiting. Floresca’s <em>Project Runway</em> mentor Christian Siriano was also in attendance, and it felt both poetic and prophetic that Floresca is also adding to the legacy of embracing true runway diversity. <br /><br />As New York Fashion Week wrapped, social media was only beginning to set itself ablaze with <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DU6qBxcEmoA/?img_index=1"">reactions to the new Netflix documentary centered on <em>America’s Next Top Model</em></a>, particularly  the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/harmful-beauty-standards-artificial-intelligence"">impossible beauty standards</a> that persisted then and seem intent on making a vicious comeback today. While reactions to the show — and the harmful standards that were upheld in the era of <em>ANTM — </em>are rightfully horrified, it’s worth looking at the present in the same lens.<br /><br />Fashion is meant to be forward-looking, creative, and progressive, but all too often falls into the “that’s just the way things are” default.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p><strong>Designers letting themselves off the diversity hook now, thinking the current wave of regressive and exclusionary ideals will be an excuse, will inevitably find themselves on the wrong side of history. </strong></p><cite>Sarah Chiwaya</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>For now, the bright spots and the designers that see fashion for all will keep me going. As Curwen said after his show: “Those who are told ‘no’ the most in the industry are the ones we pay the most attention to.” In doing so, Curwen and designers like him set themselves apart from the crowded field of brands all targeting the least populous market (aka straight sizes). Here’s hoping the industry gets on board with this more expansive view of who belongs in fashion, and other designers see the opportunity that true inclusion presents, for both business and the human obligation. </p>

<p>As a fashion writer, dressing up for New York Fashion Week is both exhilarating and daunting to me (especially during the February shows when a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-jackets-for-women"">winter coat</a> can make or break your outfit). Do I opt for an all-black, NY journalist uniform? Do I try to go all out like one of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-street-style"">Getty-photographed fashion darlings</a>? Or do I dress on-theme for specific shows? Decisions, decisions!<br /><br />At this point, I’ve grown accustomed to the chaos and long days of NYFW, so I like to plan my outfits well ahead of time. When I was planning out this season’s looks for seven straight days, I predominately considered pieces that I’d feel most comfortable in — because when I left my BK home, I certainly wasn’t going back to do a not-so-quick change in the middle of my packed schedule.<br /><br />Leaning on the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-2026-fashion-beauty-lookbook"">Refinery29’s Winter 2026 Lookbook</a> for some outfit inspiration, I decided that — with what I already had in my closet and what brands graciously leant to me for the week — I’d put my own twist on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-fashion-beauty-trends-forecast-2025-2026"">“The Demuralist” look</a> (with hints of The Weather-Maxxer and The Holiday Host aesthetics) for Day 2 of NYFW.<br /><br />In this reimagined Roaring Twenties look: “The all-black uniform gets a festive lift here with sequins and quietly elegant accessories.” While I’m not the most sparkly person, I took bits and pieces from this modern flapper aesthetic and styled a glam look that could take me from day to night, across the city, and confidently into five designers’ runway shows.<br /><br />Ahead, see how I interpreted R29’s stylist-vetted Demuralist trend, the exact pieces I wore (including an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-trends"">on-trend hat moment</a>), and outfit inspo to get you through the rest of the frigid winter in style. </p>

<p>Some themes of “The Demuralist” include dark palettes, luxe details, and rich textures. “We wanted to lean into this idea of the ‘20s and that being a reference point for celebration,” stylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/christinenicholson__/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Christine Nicholson</a> told me behind the scenes of the R29 photoshoot. “We kept the idea of craftsmanship as it relates to things like beading, but made it feel new and fresh.” <br /><br />Taking style cues (but not hard and fast rules) from the lookbook, I opted for my black <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/madewell-alexa-chung-collaboration-2024"">Madewell x Alexa Chung</a> oversized corduroy blazer, rather than a statement dress. I just love the thick fabric and unexpected bright-white buttons. I doubled down on the textures of this look by wearing a white ribbed sweater with fluffy wrist cuffs (that perfectly peeked out from my blazer sleeves) from <a href=""https://www.cupshe.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cupshe</a>. And while the R29 model was styled in funky culottes under her <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/spring-dress-trends-2025"">drop-waist dress</a>, I chose my unassumingly stretchy and comfy trousers from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-lululemon-gifts"">Lululemon</a> that I knew would keep my legs warm.<br /><br />With my base layers offering a more masculine silhouette, it then came time to jazz up the look with feminine flapper energy through accessorizing. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959893.jpeg?width=854&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=427%3A512"" /></figure></div>

<p>The Demuralist look consists of long sequined gloves (Note: opera gloves were everywhere during NYFW!), fuzzy Mary Jane heels, and, of course, a spectacular headpiece. And to my delight, I knew just the pieces that would give a similar festive and vintage flair, that felt wearable; not just editorial. <br /><br />I excitedly whipped out the funky magenta fur mittens I had purchased as a tween. (While they at one point revolted me, they’re of course back in style and add a touch of whimsy to every winter outfit.) I also slipped on my burgundy <a href=""https://www.vivaia.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Vivaia</a> knit waterproof boots, which were the perfect touch of color and texture (and sensible for the snowy streets).<br /><br />The cherry on top of this ’20s-esque look came about while rummaging through <a href=""https://tjmaxx.tjx.com/store/index.jsp"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">TJ Maxx</a> (my favorite pastime). I stumbled on a burgundy faux fur trapper-like hat that felt like it was from a past era, and knew I wanted to wear it during NYFW.<br /><br />The final touch (that I picked up just one day before NYFW) was an incredible faux fur scarf-shawl-hybrid from <a href=""https://misscircle.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miss Circle</a>. It was so luxe and dramatic, and helped me channel some flapper energy. (It also brought me the biggest compliments from industry peers throughout the day!)</p>

<p>While translating a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-2026-fashion-beauty-lookbook"">bold editorial photoshoot fashion look</a> into a wearable IRL look was at first daunting, the final outcome wound up being one of my favorite NYFW outfits to date.<br /><br />Taking notes from the R29 Lookbook helped inspire an outfit I may have never put together otherwise. In the end, my interpretation had me feeling festive, comfortable, confident, and most importantly, like myself. And I can say with confidence that you <em>have </em>to try it for yourself too.</p>

<p>As a beauty editor of ten years, I’ve been a guest at a fair share of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dyson-hairstyling-tools-worth-it-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">hair tool</a> launch events, from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-flexfusion-styler-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">blow-out brushes</a> that are like having your own personal hairstylist, to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mermade-hair-curling-iron-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">curling irons</a> that use clever mechanisms to draw your hair in and form a perfect tousle. But none have drawn as many collective “Oohs” and “Ahhs” from my editor peers as <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fshark-silkipro-straight-wet-to-dry-straightener-rapid-blow-dryer-plum-satin%2FHT400PU.html%3Fdwvar_HT400PU_color%3DA875B3"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shark’s new SilkiPro</a>. </p>



<p>I know what you’re thinking: <em>another hair tool?</em> And you’d have a fair point. In recent years, Shark has unveiled the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fbuild-your-own-shark-glam-hot-tool-air-styling-drying-system%2FHD6000PKSN.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glam AirStyling System</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fshark-glossi-2-in-1-hot-tool-and-air-glosser-juniper%2FHT302TL.html%3Fdwvar_HT302TL_color%3D429195"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glossi Hot Tool</a>, and the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fbuild-your-own-shark-flexstyle-air-styling-drying-system-stone%2FHD400SN.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">FlexStyle Drying and Styling System</a> (a personal favorite of mine). But the SilkiPro Straight is different. No, really — it straightened my thick, wavy hair in ten minutes flat when it usually takes 30. But more on that later.  </p>



<h2>What is Shark’s SilkiPro Straight and what are the benefits? </h2>



<p><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fshark-silkipro-straight-wet-to-dry-straightener-rapid-blow-dryer-plum-satin%2FHT400PU.html%3Fdwvar_HT400PU_color%3DA875B3"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shark’s SilkiPro</a> is a wet-to-dry straightener and blowdryer in one. Imagine your current flat iron had discreet vents inside that released warm air for a smoother finish with every pass, and you’ve got the idea.  </p>



<p>At the bottom of the tool, there’s a slide-up button that lets you select a mode for wet or damp hair, which emits heated airflow — with the intensity controlled via a separate button. There’s another mode for dry hair, which relies solely on the ceramic straightening plates, without additional airflow. In other words, it combines everything you love about a flat iron — quick, high-shine results — with the benefits of a blowdry brush like less frizz and a smoother finish.  </p>



<p>Perhaps the most brilliant feature is the built-in blowdryer. You can lock the tool closed, and the airflow comes out from the sides, letting you rough-dry your hair before styling. </p>

<h2>What makes Shark’s SilkiPro Straight special? </h2>



<p>At Shark’s launch event, I was lucky enough to see the tool in action on two models — one with very thick, curly hair and another with fine, wavy hair. LA-based hairstylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jaybirmingham_/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jay Birmingham</a> was on hand to demonstrate, and I was mesmerized by how quickly it slid through the first model’s curls, leaving a sleek handful of hair in just a couple of passes.  </p>



<p>According to Birmingham, this is largely thanks to the smart, inconspicuous slots inside the tool, which accommodate combs in three different sizes — all included with the tool. Birmingham explained that if you usually “chase” your straightener with a comb or brush to achieve a smooth, sleek finish, there’s no need anymore — it’s essentially built in. The larger wide-tooth comb is especially brilliant for thick, curly, and coily hair.  </p>



<p>On the model with finer, straighter hair, Birmingham demonstrated how to create flat-iron waves by clamping the straightener on the hair and twisting it downward. When he released, it produced the most effortless tousled look. </p>

<h2>What’s the difference between Shark’s SilkiPro Straight and the Dyson AirStrait? </h2>



<p>Now, you’re probably wondering how the SilkiPro compares to Dyson’s AirStrait. While they look similar at first glance, they’re actually quite different. The AirStrait doesn’t have ceramic hot plates, whereas the SilkiPro does. This means you can use it without airflow on dry hair to straighten, create waves, or touch up your style. If you ask me, it’s also lighter and perhaps quieter — and unlike the Dyson, it comes with those aforementioned slide-in combs.  </p>



<p>Dyson’s hallmark is that its tools don’t cause heat damage, so you might assume the ceramic plates on the SilkiPro would fry your hair like a traditional straightener. Fortunately, the SilkiPro has heat sensors that adjust the temperature automatically when it gets too hot, lending silky results without split ends. Of course, repeatedly going over a section or holding the plates down for too long can still cause damage, but because it works so quickly, one or two slow passes is usually enough. (And I always recommend heat protection.) </p>



<p>In terms of results, Dyson’s tool leaves hair looking more naturally straight and swishy, while Shark’s makes mine look sleek and pin-straight. If you have layers, and you like a tool that gives your lengths some movement, the former might be a better option, or one of Shark’s round blowdry brushes.  </p>



<p>At $249.99, it’s not exactly budget-friendly, but it is slightly more affordable than the AirStrait.</p>

<h2>What to know about Shark’s SilkiPro Straight Wet to Dry Straightener + Rapid Blow Dryer </h2>



<p><strong>• </strong>A straightener-meets-blowdryer featuring different levels of airflow and temperature-controlled ceramic plates for straightening, blow-drying, and creating waves. </p>



<p><strong>• </strong>Comes with three slide-in comb attachments: a wide-tooth comb for curly or coily hair, a gentle comb for natural straight styles, and a precision comb for maximum tension. </p>



<p>• Lightweight, quiet, and suitable for all hair types.  </p>



<h2>How do you use Shark’s SilkiPro Straight? </h2>



<p>Although “wet” is in the name, SilkiPro is best used on damp or towel-dried hair. I used the blowdryer function to rough-dry my hair to about 90% dry before switching to the “For WET Hair” setting on medium heat with full airflow. Happily, you can choose both the temperature and airflow level to suit you. </p>



<p>I have one stubborn step-like wave at the back of my head, which hairstylists usually struggle to smooth with a blowdryer and round brush, but this smoothed them out in just two passes. The chunky ceramic plates, combined with the extra airflow, work together to make hair silky, straight, and soft without much effort. </p>



<p>While the tool itself looks quite large, I can confirm that because the ceramic plates extend all the way to the tip, it’s easy to reach the roots and smooth out frizz and flyaways. I managed to straighten all my hair in just 10 minutes, when it usually takes me 30. Some might call it sorcery, but I know Shark has been quietly perfecting this behind the scenes for years. </p>



<p>Beyond the smart plates and directed airflow, the gentle comb attachment helped the tool glide through my knotty hair like a hot knife through butter. I also love that the tool quiets down when you put it down and starts up again when you pick it up, making it less overstimulating. </p>



<p>Will it replace my trusty Shark Glossi? I think so — once I’ve grown my layers out. I prefer a blunt cut with straight hair on me. That said, my friends with curly hair are already eyeing it up, so who knows how long I’ll be able to hold onto it… </p>

<p>I’ve been to a lot of fashion shows. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-street-style"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">New York Fashion Week</a> is basically a sport at this point and I’m basically an Olympian. You prep, you glam, you Uber in heels because you can’t actually walk in them, and you pray the show starts late. I’ve mastered the rhythm. I know how to move. But this time, it felt different. Because for the first time ever, I wasn’t just attending a show, I was being dressed for one. And not just by anyone. By <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sergiohudson/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sergio Hudson</a>. For his <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-ready-to-wear/sergio-hudson"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Fall/Winter 2026</a> runway. On his 10th anniversary. I’m still pinching myself.  </p>



<p><strong>My Favorite Room During Fashion Week</strong> </p>



<p>Sergio Hudson’s show is hands down my favorite show to attend during New York Fashion Week. The collections are always versatile. Whether you’re a corporate baddie running a boardroom, the belle of the ball at a gala, or just a fashion girly who loves to throw that fit on, Sergio has a piece for you. And his casting is inclusive. Always. In a fashion world that still struggles with representation, his runway actually looks like us.   </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960041.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The room itself feels like the hottest and chicest invite of the year but never exclusive in a weird way. Everyone from <a href=""https://www.gettyimages.dk/detail/news-photo/yolanda-adams-sergio-hudson-and-monica-attend-sergio-hudson-news-photo/2261636426"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Monica</a> to <a href=""https://hellobeautiful.com/4581318/jackie-aina-nyfw/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jackie Aina</a> was there. And somehow, no one feels more important than the other. You feel like you belong. </p>



<p><strong>The Showroom Moment</strong> </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960042.jpg?width=583&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=583%3A1024"" /><figcaption>Screenshot</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>A few days before the show, I went to the Sergio Hudson showroom to find my look. My first option was a red blazer moment. It was giving “I own the company,” but I wasn’t fully sold. I wanted a <em>moment</em>. Then one of the stylists pulled out a silver sequin dress and I knew. I paired it with a gray wool coat draped over my shoulders and yeah, this was the bold statement I needed to make. It felt regal, dramatic, and intentional. All I needed were silver heels to finish it off. If you’re going to be dressed by Sergio Hudson for his 10th anniversary show, you don’t play small. </p>



<p><strong>Fashion Week Tried Me</strong> </p>



<p>Now here’s where the plot thickens. Show day was a mess. On the day of the show, I still hadn’t found the perfect shoes. I had two hair appointments. I had to shower, do my makeup, get dressed, and be there by 6:45 PM. </p>



<p>Appointments got pushed. My hair didn’t finish until 5 PM. I rushed home, threw on my dress, did my makeup with one eye on the clock, and ran out the door. I got in the Uber at 6:20 PM. and because it’s New York… traffic!  </p>



<p>What should have been a quick ride turned into over an hour. I was panicking the entire time. All that prep. All that anticipation. Just to possibly miss the show? I felt defeated sitting in that back seat. But by the grace of God, I made it. The show started ten minutes after I arrived. And I’m choosing to be a delusional queen and believe they stalled it for me.  </p>



<p><strong>10 Years of Excellence</strong> </p>



<p>The collection was out of this world. Bold colors. Chic tailoring. Fierce models. Looks that quite literally took your breath away. It felt celebratory but forward. A reminder that ten years in this industry, especially as a Black designer, is no small thing.  </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.essence.com/fashion/sergio-hudson-10th-anniversary-show-fashion-fw26-nyfw/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ten years </a>of vision. Ten years of staying true. Ten years of dressing powerful women and men in pieces that command attention.  </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960045.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>It’s safe to say my outfit was a hit. As I walked into the show and later as walked out, people were taking photos of me. Complimenting the dress. Stopping me mid-step. For a moment, I felt like a queen.  </p>



<p>Being dressed by a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-designers-fashion-technology"">Black designer</a>, celebrating his milestone, and sitting in a room filled with culture, excellence, and intention will always be one of the highlights of my career.  </p>



<p>Supporting Black-owned designers like Sergio Hudson isn’t just about fashion, it’s about community. It’s about showing up for the people who reflect us, design for us, and see us. I already can’t wait for the next show. </p>

<p>Over the last week, New York City proved its status as a fashion capital of the world, with talented designers showcasing creative collections on the runways, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-street-style"">in the streets</a>, and on our feeds. From “let them eat cake” aesthetics and double-duty bags to fringed frocks and leather opera gloves, New York Fashion Week brought <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-color-trends-2026"">statement fashion trends</a> and serious 2026 outfit inspo to the forefront.<br /><br />In order to get the front-row scoop on what will be huge for the fall and winter of 2026, I attended so many fashion shows and presentations that my heels hurt and phone was always on the brink of losing power. The endeavor was more than worth it because I found the standout trends (that I think you can start implementing into your wardrobe while it’s still cold!). The wonderfully disheveled <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/saltburn-indie-sleaze-2000s-fashion"">indie sleaze look</a> and head-to-toe <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-cow-print"">animal prints</a> that dominated New York’s runways are especially great for party looks, while <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/02/11305994/brooch-fashion-accessory-trend"">brooches</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-balaclavas-bonnets-knitted-hooded-scarf"">headwear</a> can add flair to any winter outfit.<br /><br />Ahead, see which brands — from New York staples like Tory Burch to NYFW debuts like that of designer-denim staple 7 For All Mankind — took on similar trends in their own unique points of view.  Then shop styles to get the looks.</p>

<h2>Vintage-Inspired Brooches for Today</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959927.png?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>Wondering what the stand-out accessory of the A/W 2026 shows were? It <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shoe-trends-2026"">wasn’t just one shoe trend</a> or a particular purse or a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-tarnish-free-gold-jewelry"">statement necklace</a>. It was the brooch. Ranging from metal sculptures from the likes of Caroline Herrera, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-x-cult-gaia-collaboration-shop"">Cult Gaia</a>, and Tory Burch; crystal cascades courtesy of Collina Strada; 3D glass florals by Caroline Zimbalist; and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUvv79tCbKo/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sergio Hudson</a>’s fabric-covered designs, many brands put their seal of approval on a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/designer-fashion-secondhand-the-realreal-ebay-poshmark"">vintage staple</a>.<br /><br />These modern designs might look out of place in your grandmother’s jewelry box (but that doesn’t mean she won’t want to borrow your baubles from time to time!). Pin them to your sweater, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-jackets-for-women"">winter coat</a>, or to secure your scarf for fashion <em>and</em> function. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Animals Gone Wild</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959932.png?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>I can confidently say that animal prints will never go out of style. In fact, they’ve essentially become neutrals that can seamlessly integrate into everyone’s wardrobes today. This season, brands like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/old-navy-anna-sui-collaboration-2025"">Anna Sui</a>, Norma Kamali, Ralph Lauren, and Ulla Johnson tapped the fan-favorite cheetah and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-leopard-print-2"">leopard prints</a>. Looking to find inspiration from other corners of the animal kingdom? Kim Shui and Markarian introduced tiger prints, while Kate Hundley and Sergio Hudson offered snakeskin sets, and Bronx and Banco sent out a zebra purse.<br /><br />Animal illustrations were also big sources of inspiration, as Alix of Bohemia featured a whole zoo worth of animal prints and embellishments (think: giraffes and monkeys!). Swans also popped up across Tanner Fletcher outerwear and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DU4lDRfiI_F/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Aknvas</a> button-downs if avian-inspired looks are more your style.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong>The Grunge &amp; Indie Sleaze Scene</strong></h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959934.png?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>For those of us who <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-sandy-liang-collaboration-2025"">crave nostalgia</a>, it’s exciting to note that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/madewell-alexa-chung-collaboration-2025"">the ‘90s</a> and early 2000s have never been more back! Specifically, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/joaquina-90s-grunge-era-jcpenney-collection"">moody grunge</a> and indie sleaze party-girl aesthetics are having a moment, with dark palettes, messy styling, and even disheveled, slept-in hair (look no further than Collina Strada’s models for proof). <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-dresses-for-women"">Plaid prints</a> featured heavily in the anchor pieces of several collections, including <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/coach-handbag-trends"">Coach</a>’s youthful blazers as well as Collina Strada’s and Private Policy’s dresses.<br /><br />The <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUuHzuajEmc/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">7 For All Mankind runway show</a> was also a master class in early-aughts styling, down to the energy and even the <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUuXgANjkvZ/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">models’ viral walks</a>. Think, lots of layering, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/denim-trends-2026"">all-denim-everything</a>, skinny scarves, platform pumps, jumbo shoulder bags, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-chunky-jewelry"">chunky jewelry</a> all together — because in this case, more is more. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Hat Attack</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959935.png?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>Bundling up in the cold has never looked so chic. Hats and headpieces served as the cherry on top of this season’s runway looks, serving inspiration for right now and next winter. Designers especially made the case for having headwear for every outfit and event, no matter how casual or fancy. Designs included chic pillbox hats and caps that tie around the neck (Christian Cowan), fur trapper hats and headbands (Aknvas and Bronc and Banco), oversized knit silhouettes (Advisry), extra-long beanies (Private Policy), lace skull caps (Prabal Gurung and LaQuan Smith), and beaded head coverings (Jane Wade) across womenswear <em>and</em> menswear alike.<br /><br />The impossibly stylish <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/02/11856777/asap-rocky-verdict-court-case-timeline"">A$AP Rocky</a> even wore a fur trapper to close out the NYFW debut of his brand AWGE, giving hats a celebrity stamp of approval! </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>All Laced Up</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959936.png?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>While the collections that New York City’s designers showed this season weren’t as stiff or structured as some in the past, lacing still showed up as a major throughline. For proof, look no further than Adeam’s, Elena Velez’s, and Meruert Tolegen’s not-so-basic corsets and dresses.<br /><br />Those seeking more casual interpretations of the trend can turn to Kate Hundley’s lace-up <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-puffer-jacket"">puffer jacket</a>, which is proof that your winter puffer can not only not ruin your outfit; it can make your entire look. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUxFffpjp26/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Gabe Gordon</a>’s lace-up knit skirt also feels as right for après ski as it does for a Saturday <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nyfw-fall-winter-2024-trends"">athleisure look</a>.

Worn For Life,” Reebok</a> is bringing in a new iteration of the sneaker brand’s long-favorite style — and for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/karol-g-latina-foreva-controversy"">Karol G</a>, who’s fronting the campaign, just wearing the latest drop is, literally, a dream come true.<br /><br />In January, when the Colombian pop star was named Reebok’s new global brand ambassador, Karol G — born Carolina Giraldo Navarro — <a href=""https://www.complex.com/sneakers/a/matt-welty/reebok-signs-karol-g-interview"">told <em>Complex</em></a> that growing up in Medellín in the early 2000s, she’d get lost in reveries of herself walking around her school campus in a pair of Reebok Classics. <br /><br />“Wearing Reeboks became a huge thing when I was at school, especially this Classic version. Having a pair felt like everything. I remember dreaming about them, imagining how it would feel to finally wear them and show them off,” she told the publication. <br /><br />The sneakers were so popular among Latine youth that Reebok even collaborated with the biggest star of reggaeton at the time, Daddy Yankee, for a “DY” signature sneaker and apparel line in 2005.<br /><br />Now, with reggaeton one of the most popular genres in the world and Karol G as one of its front-runners, it’s her turn. And the Grammy award-winning singer isn’t just wearing Reebok Classics like she dreamed — campaign photos of her in the 131-year-old footwear brand can be seen all over, from Medellín to the rest of the world. <br /><br />As part of “Born Classic. Worn For Life,” the sports culture brand launched its most popular lifestyle sneakers crafted in 100% real, full-grain premium garment leather, including Club C 85 Vintage, Freestyle Lo, Workout Plus. <br /><br />And while the sneakers were just made available on February 18, <a href=""https://wwd.com/footwear-news/shoe-trends/karol-g-reebok-ambassador-media-impact-value-1238514597/"">WWD reported</a> in late January that just the announcement of Karol G as Reebok’s latest ambassador generated $1.1 million in Media Impact Value (MIV) in 48 hours for the footwear brand. <br /><br />Swipe to see what all the hype is about.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

But the simplicity of its low-cut design quickly made it a staple off the court, too. Now, the Club C 85 Vintage, available in unisex and women’s, channels the same minimalist spirit of the ’80s classic, reimagined with a premium garment leather upper.

<p>Over the last few days, the social media firing squad has been aimed at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tyrabanks/"">Tyra Banks</a> and the producers behind <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363307/""><em>America’s Next Top Model</em></a>, the cultural phenomenon of a reality show that aired from 2003 to 2018 and spawned dozens of international spinoffs. <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/81928842?trackId=259776131&amp;trkId=259776131&amp;src=tudum""><em>Reality Check: Inside America’s Next Top Model</em></a> is proof that the more things change, the more they stay the same.</p>



<p>The Netflix docuseries, which premiered on February 11, featured firsthand accounts from models, including <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ebonyehaith/?hl=en"">Ebony Haith</a> (Cycle 1), <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/shandithecatlady/?hl=en"">Shandi Sullivan</a> (Cycle 2) and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/danievans1/?hl=en"">Danielle Evans</a> (Cycle 6) as well as judges <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/mrjaymanuel/?hl=en"">Jay Manuel</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/miss_jalexander/?hl=en"">J. Alexander</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/nigelbarker/?hl=en"">Nigel Barker</a>. Through three episodes, viewers get a firsthand look at the exploitative conditions contestants were subjected to each cycle. That included extreme makeovers using plastic surgery and dental work, blackface and racist stereotypes as photoshoot themes and a sexual assault that was intentionally caught on film. Banks and former <em>ANTM</em> executive producer <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0596298/"">Ken Mok</a>, who both served as executive producers for <em>Reality Check</em>, were also interviewed.</p>



<p>For 24 cycles, Banks was able to bully women into becoming the American ideal standard of what the “ideal woman” was at that time. And for millennials who were coming of age at the height of the show, it was not only appointment television; it was a rubric for how to become worthy of adoration.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959823.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /><figcaption>Reality Check: Inside America’s Next Top Model.

<p><em>ANTM</em> was one of the first times millennials witnessed hyperfemininity politics on display in the media through a reality show competition. As a little Black girl from the Midwest, watching the women who looked like me on the show further ingrained a conditioning that was already at play: that, to the world, I could only be beautiful with conditions. With <em>Reality Check</em>, flashbacks of Ebony’s gorgeous skin being called dull and ashy came rushing to the forefront. Danielle Evans being pressured to close her gap influenced me to want braces (thank you for not acquiescing, mom). Watching judges dismiss the concerns of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/iamtoccarajones/?hl=en"">Tocarra Jones</a> (Cycle 3), a full-figured woman from my hometown who I grew up looking up to, injured my confidence as I grew into my own curves.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Banks skirts accountability in an astonishingly delusional manner throughout the docuseries. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>And as a child, I was convinced Black girls couldn’t show their hurt like <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1909197/"">Tiffany Richardson</a> (Cycle 4) did, lest be seen as aggressive, ungrateful and undeserving.</p>



<p>“It was very, very intense but you guys were demanding it, and so we kept pushing more and more and more,” Banks said in <em>Reality Check</em>.</p>



<p>Banks skirts accountability in an astonishingly delusional manner throughout the docuseries. The trauma this show left with these women — especially the sexual assault of Shandi, which the documentary doesn’t name as such — was real, and Banks is to blame. At the same time, there’s some validity in her statement that we can’t ignore. No, viewers didn’t force Banks to exploit these women,  and much of the trauma they were subjected to has come into perspective only recently, but the buck doesn’t stop with Banks or this show.</p>

<p><em>ANTM</em> wasn’t just a look into the exploitative extremes models experienced behind the scenes. It held a mirror up to the homogenous beauty standards that Americans celebrated in the early to mid aughts. The message was resounding: thin and white was right. And if you were a woman of color, you better adapt quickly if you want to get anywhere.</p>



<p>As we sit firmly in 2026, it’s clear how wrong Banks and the producers were in their abuse of power. But what’s being overlooked is that history is repeating itself right before our eyes.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p><em>ANTM</em> wasn’t just a look into the exploitative extremes models experienced behind the scenes.

<p>With social media, there’s an insurmountable pressure that comes with showing up as your best. And unlike in 2003, the feedback is in real time. With a growing amount of content creators and influencers relying on social media platforms for their livelihoods, it takes more time, energy and money than ever before to keep up with appearances. For many, that’s the difference between economic stability or missing out on opportunities.</p>



<p>Body positivity feels like a thing of the past as the idea of thinness reemerges as a status symbol and the <a href=""https://www.today.com/video/cosmetic-surgery-is-drawing-younger-patients-and-more-men-250889285677"">demand for cosmetic procedures</a> for younger groups increases. Doctors and marketers <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/glp-1-brands-enter-their-super-bowl-era/"">push GLP-1s</a> on any and everyone regardless of clinical need. And <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sydney_sweeney/"">Sydney Sweeney’s</a> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/08/11924722/sydney-sweeney-american-eagle-ad-controversy-republican-trump"">“great jeans” American Eagle ad</a> feels in conversation with <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/miketyson/"">Mike Tyson’s</a> <a href=""https://mashable.com/article/mike-tyson-super-bowl-ad-maha-fatphobia"">fat shaming Super Bowl ad</a> funded by Make America Healthy Again.</p>



<p>In addition, the needle hasn’t moved much on Black women being labeled “aggressive” and facing <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/07/11923428/jana-craig-love-island-kenny-rodriguez-breakup"">microaggressions and outright racism</a> on and off screen. Even in the show “The Traitors,” Black contestants are given <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/jan/09/black-contestants-the-traitors-reality-tv"">far less grace</a> to prove themselves as “faithfuls” due to stereotypes being used as evidence of their integrity.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959856.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=799&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A799"" /></figure>



<p>So many of us who watched <em>ANTM</em> growing up have done work to divorce ourselves from the limiting beliefs that the show and others instilled in us growing up. (For me, that looked like embracing my curves and natural hair.) But witnessing progressive ideas of beauty disappear in media while it simultaneously shames Banks feels a bit hypocritical.</p>



<p>It’s frustrating to see Banks refuse to take accountability for her wrongdoings and have the nerve to tease a Cycle 25 that may go to less extremes but will be likely to fall into old patterns. But what’s also true is that she is the perfect scapegoat for this moment to keep us comfortable in repeating the same mistakes. There’s a regressiveness happening that we can’t ignore. Today, it’s a reality check that our favorite show perpetuated the same system it said it wanted to change. Tomorrow it’s something far more sinister. </p>
