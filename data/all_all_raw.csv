The 3600 views are equally exciting; therefore, needed significant consideration. Envisaged as a circular edge of a ""forest clearing"", the structure needed to merge with the dense plantation.

<p>By shifting rotation away from traditional hinges and distributing weight vertically, pivot doors were developed to address a specific architectural challenge: how to move large, heavy door panels with precision, durability, and minimal visual interference. These systems allow doors to grow significantly in scale, weight, and material ambition, often blurring the line between door, wall, and architectural surface. Over time, this technical innovation has expanded the role of doors in architecture, allowing them to operate not only as points of access, but also as spatial thresholds, compositional devices, and expressive elements within the building envelope.</p>",

<h4>An accessibility-focused evolution of Inter that blends modern geometry with hyperlegible design principles.</h4><figure><img alt=""Cover image showing the name “Hyperlegible Sans” on a dark background, with supporting text describing it as an accessibility-focused evolution of Inter’s modern aesthetic, including version number 1.0, open-source license, and available weights (regular, medium, bold)."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*cYZPrBJzp61844wdgTnRSg.png"" /><figcaption>Hyperlegible Sans, a free, open-source typeface designed as an accessibility-focused evolution of Inter. Version 1.0 includes Regular, Medium, and Bold weights.</figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://github.com/matthewlarn/hyperlegible-sans/releases/latest""><strong>Download Latest Font</strong></a></p><p>I’ve used <a href=""https://rsms.me/inter/"">Inter</a> for years. It’s been my default across dozens of projects and, in my opinion, represents the best of open-source typography. Its clean geometry, strong engineering, and consistent rhythm have made it a staple of modern design systems. Over time, especially while working on accessibility-focused products, I began noticing small limitations. Certain glyphs blurred together at smaller sizes, some bowls felt tight in low-vision contexts, and characters like I, l, and 1 weren’t distinct enough for readers who rely on extra clarity. None of this diminished my respect for Inter, it simply highlighted areas where accessibility could be improved.</p><p>Because of these legibility challenges, when I started doing product work for <a href=""https://loudandclear.io/""><em>Loud + Clear</em></a>, an app designed for people with Parkinson’s, I turned to <a href=""https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/"">Atkinson Hyperlegible</a>. It’s one of the most thoughtfully designed accessibility fonts available, with radically open forms and unmistakable glyph shapes that prioritize clarity. For low-vision users, it excels.</p><p>But I missed Inter’s visual aesthetic, its modern geometry, contemporary rhythm, and the familiarity designers expect in UI typography. I admired Atkinson’s readability and Inter’s overall look, and kept wishing there were a way to bring the strengths of both into a single design.</p><p><strong>Hyperlegible Sans</strong> is the result. It’s an open-source fork of Inter that preserves its modern character while incorporating hyperlegible principles inspired by Atkinson. It isn’t meant to replace either font, just to offer another option, one that didn’t exist before.</p><p>What I changed (and why)</p><p>The philosophy behind Hyperlegible Sans is simple: keep the visual identity of Inter intact, but reduce ambiguity wherever it appears.

Good typography should simply work for everyone.</p><p>Hyperlegible Sans reflects a belief I carry into every project: <strong>design can be both beautiful and accessible</strong>.</p><p>We don’t need to choose between modern geometry and clear letterforms. We can have both.</p><p>Design is full of these false choices, and part of the work is expanding the range of tools available so designers can choose what best fits their intentions.</p><h3>What’s next for Hyperlegible Sans</h3><p>This is only version 1. The roadmap includes:</p><ul><li>additional weights</li><li>a full variable font</li><li>expanded punctuation</li><li>broader language support</li><li>refinements for dark mode and low-contrast environments</li></ul><p>And like Inter, this project is open-source. I’m uploading the complete files to GitHub, along with documentation on the changes and a roadmap for future versions.</p><p>My hope is simple: that this font becomes another tool in the accessibility toolkit. Something UI designers, developers, and product teams can reach for when they need both clarity and beauty, when they want typography that reflects how modern design should work.</p><p>Not less beautiful. Not more clinical. Just clearer, easier, more humane.</p><p><a href=""https://github.com/matthewlarn/hyperlegible-sans""><strong>View “Hyperlegible Sans” on Github</strong></a></p><figure><img alt=""Text layout titled “Why Legibility Matters,” explaining how clear letterforms and spacing improve readability, reduce cognitive effort, and support comfortable reading in conditions such as small sizes, low contrast, or motion."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*A0mM6d5g12cE1BdBg-qr7A.png"" /><figcaption>Legibility-focused text sample demonstrating how clearer letterforms, consistent spacing, and strong character differentiation reduce cognitive load and improve reading comfort.</figcaption></figure><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=7b3c823692fb"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/hyperlegible-sans-a-free-open-source-font-for-accessible-design-7b3c823692fb"">Hyperlegible Sans: a free, open-source font for accessible design</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4><strong><em>How brand, data, and reuse help ideas move past the demo phase</em></strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Music platform screens vibe coded with various AI tools like Anima and Uizard"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IZ6fOsQkSAw4pHD1iXAFuA.png"" /><figcaption><em>Music platform screens vibe coded with various AI tools like Anima and Uizard</em></figcaption></figure><p>As designers, we know there are many tools at our disposal to create AI-generated UI, like Lovable, Anima, and Uizard. There has been a lot of progress in this space, with AI output at unthinkable speeds and of unprecedented quality. But still…most of it feels short-lived and unusable.</p><p><strong>The generated screens look convincing, but they’re treated as placeholders instead of starting points in the ideation process</strong>. For instance, when a generated screen needs to reflect a brand’s styling, handle real data, or align with existing patterns, the work has to be rebuilt (and the generated UI is tossed).</p><p>This is simply a mismatch between how UI is generated in AI tools and how products are actually built. So instead of avoiding constraints such as branding and data, they need to be integrated into the generation process. This way, the UI becomes more valuable and can be used to continue to iterate past a demo or proof of concept (POC) phase.</p><p>Let’s look at 3 constraints (brand styles, data, and pattern reuse) that separate generated UI that gets discarded versus UI that is used end-to-end in the product development cycle</p><h3>Start with a brand versus restyling later</h3><p>AI-generated screens typically use visual styles that are neutral, like system-default colors and typography. Though the UI feels “close enough,” it’s not truly accurate to your product’s brand (or any other brand you want to test). And once real branding is introduced, the UI designs break down from the gaps created from the neutral styling used during generation.</p><p><strong>This ultimately causes rework to better incorporate the product’s branding (either restyling elements or starting over completely)</strong>. To avoid this issue, brand alignment must become part of the initial AI prompt versus being considered as extra steps to fix in later stages.</p><figure><img alt=""UI generated by Anima that is inspired by the Airbnb brand and AI prompting"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IJ-5YTLl4BBmz8LZKf_17g.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lMHFWD8I3E""><em>Anima generates UI inspired by a brand</em></a><em> (like Airbnb) from the first AI prompt, and can make modifications to individual elements as needed</em></figcaption></figure><p>But generating UI with brand context doesn’t eliminate design judgment– it more so reduces how much work gets discarded. When generated UI reflects a real brand early in the design or ideation process, it becomes something teams can refine rather than replace.</p><h4>How to integrate branding and generated UI</h4><p>Many of the AI tools we already know are beginning to account for specific brand inclusion:</p><ul><li><strong>Anima</strong>: With <a href=""https://dev.animaapp.com/"">Anima Playground</a>, you can generate an application using the visual language of an existing brand. Just write the app you want to build, along with the brand to use as inspiration (from your own brand to Airbnb’s). You can also refine individual UI elements or adjust inline copy without regenerating the designs again and again.</li><li><strong>Uizard</strong>: <a href=""https://uizard.io/autodesigner/"">Uizard’s Auto-designer</a> allows you to write a text-based prompt, then select a style (from a screenshot, URL, or brand kit). After the designs are generated, you can modify elements and generate themes.</li><li><strong>Google Stitch</strong>: Similar to the other tools, <a href=""https://stitch.withgoogle.com/"">Google Stitch</a> generates screens based on your prompt, which can include brand styling. Stitch’s output is solid, but you cannot modify individual elements; you can only use an entire screen as reference for modification requests.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""UI generated by Google Stitch that is based on the prompted brand"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0HsQrO4-IZeMRk-WU1V6-g.png"" /><figcaption><em>Google Stitch generates screens based on the requested brand, but can only modify entire screens versus single elements</em></figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: Some of the tools, like Anima, generate the UI with flexibility and can be restyled with </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lMHFWD8I3E""><em>different branding inspirations</em></a><em> without rebuilding the entire layout. So you can easily compare visual directions or get stakeholder feedback.</em></blockquote><h4>Benefits of branding from the start</h4><ul><li><strong>Faster alignment</strong>: Introducing brand context early reduces the gap between initial concepts and stakeholder expectations (shifting feedback away from styling and toward design intent)</li><li><strong>Comparison between directions</strong>: Applying different brand styles to the same layout makes it easy to evaluate options without redesigning the experience each time</li><li><strong>Less restyling later</strong>: When typography, colors, and tone are set from the start, teams spend less time retrofitting as the design evolves</li></ul><h4>Limits of branding with AI tools</h4><ul><li><strong>Surface-level branding</strong>: AI-driven branding captures visual cues like color and type, but doesn’t replace a deeper Design System</li><li><strong>Accessibility and content review</strong>: Generated UI still needs to be manually reviewed and validated by designers for accessibility and content standards</li></ul><h3>Apply real data to reveal if the UI actually works</h3><p>Screens that have been generated with AI typically use mock data as placeholder content. Though mock data helps teams understand the design idea, it also masks the hardest UX problems. Not every user goes through the ideal, “happy path”…they will encounter empty states, error flows, and permission rules.</p><p><strong>These unexpected, but common scenarios don’t show up in static screens, which means early designs can give a false sense of readiness</strong>. Without real data and content driving interactions, product teams discover these gaps late in the design and development process.</p><figure><img alt=""Database feature in Anima to view and edit real data for your app"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lWxdv2nCddjR-rjiLJXFYw.png"" /><figcaption>Anima automatically creates a database with editable data to support your project</figcaption></figure><p>Though this doesn’t replace user-centered design thinking, it ensures ideas are grounded in authentic user behavior from the beginning of the design process. So by integrating real data into the generated UI, teams can see whether interactions work, content fits, and user permissions behave as expected. This is especially important when features rely on user input, authentication, or content submission.</p><h4>How to include real data with generated UI</h4><p>With the right AI tools, you can replace placeholder content for real data:</p><ul><li><strong>Anima</strong>: You or your team can describe the data a feature needs in Anima’s Playground text prompt, and the system will generate databases and/ or tables based on the instructions. The data will be connected to the project and will automatically come with <a href=""https://www.animaapp.com/blog/product-updates/built-in-databases-for-anima-playground-zero-config-backend/?ref=fmt-handpicked"">default security policies</a> that match the intended usage.</li><li><strong>Cursor</strong>: With <a href=""https://cursor.com/"">Cursor</a>, you can integrate your codebase (GitHub or GitLab) to give AI more context, as well as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfkpZzs04-I"">connect MySQL database</a> to create elements like tables.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Manually configuring a database via extension to the Cursor tool"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0XQGV9bKFQb8nVp8VgxWGQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Cursor requires manual configuration to connect a database via extension to the AI agent</em></figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: With Anima, just about anyone can create a database (even with no code knowledge).

So teams have to rebuild or replicate familiar components, which adds unnecessary work and risks inconsistency.</p><p><strong>When screens don’t leverage existing assets or common interaction patterns, they won’t integrate with the rest of the product ecosystem</strong>. When AI can build off trusted patterns and components from the start, the generated UI becomes more durable, consistent, and easier to refine.</p><figure><img alt=""Anima’s Chrome extension lets you capture any kind of UI element on a live website"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Hp-9Z4oohRw0brznSurstQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-to-code-by-anima/paddhneaanoeljlmdepnheehdkaegblo""><em>Anima’s extension</em></a><em> lets you capture any kind of UI element on a live website, as well as manage the elements in the right rail</em></figcaption></figure><h4>How to reuse what already exists</h4><p>Tools that allow you to grab existing elements to use in your generated UI:</p><ul><li><strong>Anima</strong>: In <a href=""https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-to-code-by-anima/paddhneaanoeljlmdepnheehdkaegblo"">Anima’s Chrome extension</a>, you can capture UI components directly from live websites using the Clipboard feature.

<h4>Design principles for AI in complex systems.</h4><figure><img alt=""A painting of the Titanic Sinking"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*CN4GKLm09b9Mtmes.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Source: Artnet.com</figcaption></figure><p>Today we are at the cusp of revolutions in artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, renewable energy, and biotechnology. Each brings extraordinary promise, but each introduces more complexity, more interdependence, and more <a href=""https://www.behaviouralsafetyservices.com/Content/Downloads/Reason-Paper-Human-Error.pdf"">latent pathways to failure</a>. This elevates prudence to be critical. Good design recognizes what cannot be foreseen. It acknowledges the limits of prediction and control. It builds not merely for performance, but for recovery.</p><h4><strong>Design Not Blame</strong></h4><p>When something goes wrong, our gut reaction is to turn to the person involved. This is sometimes known as the <a href=""https://www.safetywise.com/post/latent-conditions-vs-active-failures-the-icam-investigator-s-guide-to-seeing-the-whole-picture"">active failure</a>, ascribing failure merely to the active failure is a mistake. It is a mistake that shows lack of appreciation for systems, for latent complexity, for the reality of how things fail. This reflex is a vestige of an older worldview, one in which human vigilance and effort were assumed to be the primary safeguards against failure. Now we know better.</p><p>The systems view rejects this premise entirely. A system, as we have repeated, is perfectly designed to get the results it gets. If a system produces recurring failures, the fault lies not with the operator but with the structure that shaped the operator’s choices. Good design aims not at perfect people but at ordinary people performing reliably under normal conditions.</p><p>In that spirit, good performance is not attained when we muster greater attention or exhort people to “try harder.” Rather, exceptional performance is achieved through exceptional design. Design which shapes the conditions in such a way that the correct action and the natural action are two of the same. In a well-designed system, error is eliminated not because humans have been improved, but because the system has been made incapable of producing predictable failure.</p><h4>An Integrated Philosophy of Design</h4><p>Each of the following major themes offers a distinct lens on design, but together they form a coherent blueprint.</p><h4>Latent Errors: The Why</h4><p>Latent errors teach us <em>why</em> systems fail: because latent conditions accumulate, hide, and align. The Swiss Cheese Model and <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/bad-design-is-like-a-virus-design-defects-and-latent-failures-1e0ab4be7e52"">resident pathogen metaphor</a> remind us that complexity and opaqueness invite disaster. This provides the largest, systems-focused perspective of human error and systems design. It provides the backdrop for all our design considerations.</p><figure><img alt=""Reason’s Swiss Cheese Model"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*LL8fgYaGsNyiabnP.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Source: Reason, 1997</figcaption></figure><p>Design decisions made today become the latent failures of tomorrow. Every shortcut, every unexamined assumption, every added layer of complexity is a pathogen waiting for the right conditions to cause harm.</p><h4>The Automation Paradox: The How</h4><p><a href=""https://ftp.nsjonline.com/virtual-library/Nwbza9/6GF209/the-automation-paradox.pdf"">This paradox </a>shows <em>how</em> the design and integration of automation impacts human performance and cognition. It shows that the greater trust we put on automation [any technology] the more trust we MUST put on it, for it necessarily makes the human actors even weaker. This perpetuates a vicious cycle that is not easy to extricate ourselves from.</p><p>Automation changes human capability in ways that make system failure more catastrophic. When automation works, humans deskill. When automation fails, humans cannot recover.</p><h4>Rasmussen’s Conundrum: The Where</h4><p>Jens Rasmussen reveals <em>where</em> automation excels and where it collapses. The <a href=""https://open.substack.com/pub/performancesystems/p/automation-conundrum-the-narrow-window?r=4qwh5w&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true"">Automation Conundrum</a> illustrates the narrow window of optimal performance and the importance of adaptability outside that window.</p><p>Superhuman peak performance means nothing if you cannot ensure conditions stay within the narrow range where that performance is achieved.</p><figure><img alt=""A chart showing the Rasmussen Conundrum: Automation exceeds humans in only a tightly controlled environment"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*9ZLwAj4tZJ8dic5t.png"" /><figcaption>Source: Author</figcaption></figure><h4>Together</h4><p>When combined, these frameworks yield a unified principle: Design must anticipate failure, accommodate human limitations, and employ technology in ways that extend human resilience.</p><h4>A Philosophy of Conservative Decision-Making</h4><p>Few figures embody this philosophy better than <a href=""https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/research-guides/modern-biographical-files-ndl/modern-bios-r/rickover-hyman-g.html"">Admiral Hyman G. Rickover</a>. Admiral Rickover was the first admiral of the nuclear navy. Under his leadership, the US designed and built the first nuclear submarines. Ostensively living and working next to a nuclear reactor comes with risks most people cannot fathom. Rickover recognized that catastrophic failures in complex systems seldom arise from the final, active failure. They originate as a consequence of earlier decisions. Decisions about materials, oversight, testing, assumptions, priorities. His remedy was a disciplined ethic of restraint and responsibility.</p><figure><img alt=""Admiral Rickover on the cover of Time Magazine, Jan 1954"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/0*lHB5ysPN2hJsllet.jpg"" /><figcaption>Source: Content.Time.Com</figcaption></figure><p>Rickover insisted on what he called <a href=""https://taproot.com/non-conservative-decision-making/"">conservative decision-making</a>. This meant favoring the proven over the novel, the simple over the clever, the transparent over the abstract. It also favors direct accountability over distributed blame. Rickover required engineers to understand every system they touched, to foresee how it could fail, and to take personal responsibility for its performance.</p><p>This philosophy is not opposed to innovation. It is opposed to undue confidence and corner cutting. It rejects the fantasy that more automation, more layers of protection, or more complexity can eliminate human fallibility. Instead, Rickover’s ethic aligns perfectly with Reason, and Rasmussen: The best systems are those designed with keen awareness of their limits, with clarity in how they function, and resilient in the face of the unexpected.</p><h4>Design and AI</h4><p>Nowhere are the principles of good design more urgently needed than in systems that incorporate artificial intelligence. AI is not merely another automation layer; it is a new kind of agent inside our systems — opaque, statistical, fast, and prone to unfamiliar <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/failure-mode"">failure modes</a>. It makes predictions rather than following instructions, and its logic is embedded in inscrutable data patterns rather than explicit rules. All of this magnifies the challenges highlighted by Reason, Rasmussen, and Rickover.</p><h4>AI Accumulates Latent Failures</h4><p>AI systems, by their very nature, accumulate latent failures. They learn from datasets we did not fully inspect, absorb correlations we did not intend, and behave in ways that are not visible or understandable from the outside. A model might perform flawlessly for months before a quiet change in data distribution causes an abrupt collapse.</p><p>This is Reason’s “resident pathogens” writ large: dormant vulnerabilities that lie hidden until the right alignment triggers failure. Every training decision, every data preprocessing choice, every architecture selection, every hyperparameter is a potential pathogen. And unlike traditional software where we can inspect the logic, AI embeds these decisions in millions of parameters that no human can comprehend.</p><p>The problem is compounded because:</p><ul><li>Training data is never complete or representative</li><li>Correlations learned may be spurious</li><li>Performance on training data doesn’t guarantee real-world performance</li><li>Models drift as real-world conditions change</li><li>Failure modes are unpredictable and emergent</li></ul><h4>AI Erodes Human-Centered Design</h4><p>AI erodes the very foundations of <a href=""https://medium.com/dc-design/what-is-human-centered-design-6711c09e2779"">human-centered design</a>. Visibility, mapping, and feedback weaken when decisions emerge from statistical inference. Users cannot form an accurate mental model of a system when its internal logic is fundamentally opaque.</p><p>A well-designed traditional system has clear cause-and-effect relationships. You turn the dial, the temperature changes. You press the button, the action occurs. You can build a mental model of how it works and predict what will happen.</p><p>AI systems break this clarity. You provide input, you get output, but the relationship between them is inscrutable. Why did the AI make this recommendation? What factors did it consider? What would happen if conditions changed? These questions often have no satisfying answers.</p><p>A well-designed AI system must restore visibility through explanations, constraints, and clear domain limits so that human operators understand not just what the AI chose, but why and under what assumptions. This means:</p><ul><li>Clear communication of confidence levels</li><li>Explanation of key factors in decisions</li><li>Explicit boundaries of competence</li><li>Graceful degradation when uncertain</li><li>Human-understandable reasoning paths</li></ul><h4>AI Intensifies the Automation Paradox</h4><p>Rasmussen’s automation conundrum becomes particularly acute with AI. AI excels in routine, predictable environments but breaks sharply at the edges. This is especially manifest in <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14859"">instances where people are deliberately trying to break AI</a>. When conditions drift or the unexpected occurs, AI systems fail in ways that human operators are least prepared to correct. Meanwhile, human skill declines as more decision-making is delegated to the machine.</p><figure><img alt=""A sketch explaining the automation paradox. Reliance on technology leads to fast, unexpected failures"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*BC598V3Egz_dPzvq"" /><figcaption>Source: Sketchplanations.com</figcaption></figure><p>The result is a brittle system which may be high-performing on ordinary days, but extremely volatile and vulnerable on extraordinary ones.</p><p>But AI makes this worse than traditional automation because:</p><ul><li>AI failure modes are less predictable (it doesn’t just stop working; it confidently produces wrong answers)</li><li>AI operates in domains requiring judgment (not just mechanical tasks)</li><li>AI deskills faster (it handles tasks humans used to do cognitively, not just physically)</li><li>Recovery is harder (humans may not recognize AI errors without domain expertise)</li></ul><h4>AI Demands Conservative Decision-Making</h4><p>Rickover’s philosophy offers the necessary counterweight. Conservative decision-making demands restraint: use AI where it is appropriate, proven, and transparent, not merely where it is impressive.</p><p>This means:</p><ul><li>Favor smaller, interpretable models over unnecessarily complex ones</li><li>Limit autonomy in high-stakes domains</li><li>Maintain human accountability for every decision the system makes</li><li>Require understanding of failure modes before deployment</li><li>Choose proven approaches over novel ones</li><li>Insist on transparency in how decisions are made</li></ul><p>In Rickover’s world, responsibility cannot be delegated to software. Someone must always “sign their name.” This echos a popular meme going around allegedly showing a memo from IBM in the 1970s. “A computer can never be held accountable…Therefore a computer must never make a management decision. This principle becomes even more critical with AI, where the temptation is to let the algorithm decide without human oversight let alone accountability.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/687/0*TJuzJ5y0jw9vqYOL"" /></figure><h4>Practical Philosophy for AI Design</h4><p>Taken together, these perspectives form a coherent philosophy for AI design. AI does not require us to reinvent the principles of good design. It requires us to apply them more rigorously than ever before.</p><h4>1. Assume AI Will Fail</h4><p>Design systems assuming AI will fail, not assuming it will work. This means:</p><ul><li>Clear handoff protocols when AI reaches its limits</li><li>Human oversight for critical decisions</li><li>Fallback mechanisms that don’t depend on AI</li><li>Monitoring for distribution drift and performance degradation</li><li>Regular testing outside the training distribution</li></ul><h4>2. Preserve Human Capability</h4><p>Don’t allow AI to completely deskill human operators. This means:</p><ul><li>Keeping humans in the loop for critical decisions</li><li>Requiring periodic manual operation of tasks</li><li>Training for exceptions, not just normal operation</li><li>Maintaining domain expertise even when AI handles routine cases</li></ul><h4>3. Demand Transparency</h4><p>Insist on explainable AI for any consequential application. This means:</p><ul><li>Understanding what factors influence decisions</li><li>Knowing the confidence level of predictions</li><li>Recognizing when the AI is operating outside its competence</li><li>Being able to audit decisions after the fact</li></ul><h4>4. Define Clear Boundaries</h4><p>Explicitly define where AI should and shouldn’t be used. This means:</p><ul><li>Clear specifications of the optimal design domain</li><li>Hard limits on autonomy in high-stakes situations</li><li>Explicit human authority for final decisions</li><li>Recognition that some tasks should never be fully automated</li></ul><h4>5. Design for Recovery</h4><p>Plan for what happens when AI fails, not just how it performs when it works. This means:</p><ul><li>Clear error <a href=""https://pdhacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Detection-of-Errors-Course-for-Website.pdf"">detection and signaling</a></li><li>Graceful degradation rather than catastrophic failure</li><li>Human-understandable system states</li><li>Recovery protocols that don’t require AI expertise</li></ul><h4>6. Take Responsibility</h4><p>Maintain human accountability for AI-made decisions. This means:</p><ul><li>Someone is responsible for every consequential decision</li><li>Regular review of AI performance and errors</li><li>Willingness to roll back AI when it underperforms</li><li>Ethical guidelines that don’t hide behind algorithmic decisions</li></ul><h4>A Warning Circa 1990</h4><p>In 1990, James Reason warned of grave technological dangers:</p><blockquote><em>“A point has been reached in the development of technology where the greatest dangers stem not so much from the breakdown of a major component or from isolated operator errors, as from the insidious accumulation of delayed-action human failures occurring primarily within the organizational and managerial sectors.”</em></blockquote><p>If that was true in an age where the internet was still ascendent, TV the dominant form of entertainment, and phones and computers still geographically bound to the office and the home, it is exponentially more true today. Inscrutable design is a ticking time bomb for failure. AI has merely made that opacity more common, almost necessary.</p><figure><img alt=""An old, inscrutable nuclear control panel"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/793/0*7J2808IyNreqs36_.png"" /><figcaption>Source: Taproot.com</figcaption></figure><p>The proliferation of software layers, automated decision-making, globalized workflows, and complex interdependencies has increased both the number of resident pathogens and the difficulty of detecting them. Many failures today arise not from dramatic mistakes but from quiet misalignments: an assumption not documented, a procedure not updated, a dataset not validated, a safeguard added without understanding what it hides.</p><h4>The Designer’s New Responsibility</h4><p>Designers, therefore, inherit a new responsibility. Their task is not merely to make systems functional or efficient, but to make them <em>understandable</em>. To build systems with fewer hidden couplings. To reduce opacity. To create clear cause-effect relationships. To design for transparency, resilience, and recovery.</p><p>This responsibility extends beyond engineering. Latent errors emerge from management decisions, organizational cultures, incentives, and expectations. The designer cannot control every upstream choice, but the designer can insist upon principles like simplicity, clarity, conservatism, recoverability that reduce the accumulation of resident pathogens.</p><h4>Designing for Latent Complexity</h4><p>The imperative is one of prudence, not perfection. Good design recognizes what cannot be foreseen. It acknowledges the limits of prediction and control. It builds not merely for performance, but for recovery.</p><p>A system designed in this spirit can:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://diptendud.medium.com/understanding-resilience-in-system-design-5f4886eb8ad9"">Endure shocks without catastrophic failure</a></li><li>Adapt to inevitable new conditions and applications</li><li>Avoid the catastrophic alignment of latent failures</li><li>Preserve human agency without depending on individual heroism</li><li>Use technology without succumbing to its arrogance</li></ul><p>Such systems are not just safer. They are more humane, more comprehensible, and ultimately more worthy of the trust we place in them.</p><h4>The Path Forward</h4><p>The future of design, especially in the age of AI, requires us to hold two truths simultaneously:</p><p>First, technology, including AI, offers <a href=""https://www.online.uc.edu/blog/artificial-intelligence-ai-benefits.html"">genuine benefits</a>. It can enhance human capability, reduce errors in routine tasks, reveal patterns we couldn’t see, and free us from tedious work.</p><p>Second, technology, especially AI, introduces new failure modes, new latent errors, new paradoxes that make systems more fragile precisely when they appear most capable.</p><p>The solution is not to reject technology but to deploy it with wisdom inherited from generations of <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915002860"">systems thinking</a>, <a href=""https://www.hfes.org/"">human factors</a> research, and hard-won lessons from failures.</p><p>This means:</p><ul><li>Designing with awareness of latent failures</li><li>Understanding the paradox of automation</li><li>Respecting the conundrum of narrow performance windows</li><li>Applying conservative decision-making</li><li>Maintaining human <a href=""https://infusedinnovations.com/blog/responsible-ai-accountability"">accountability</a></li><li>Building for recovery, not just performance</li></ul><p>The designer’s task is not only to create intelligent systems, but to ensure those systems remain understandable, bounded, recoverable, and responsible. AI magnifies both the power of good design and the consequences of poor design. It is the ultimate test of our ability to design systems that align with human judgment, human values, and human limits.</p><p>The stakes have never been higher. The principles have never been clearer. The question is whether we have the wisdom and restraint to apply them before the next catastrophic failure forces us to learn these lessons again, at a cost we can ill afford.</p><p>The future of design is not about making systems smarter. It’s about making systems wiser. Systems that know their limits, acknowledge their failures, and preserve the human capabilities that technology promises to enhance but often erodes.</p><p>That is the philosophy we must carry forward into an age where artificial intelligence will touch nearly every aspect of our lives. The question is not whether AI will be powerful but whether we will be wise enough to design it responsibly.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=cc6733aedcfa"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/against-cleverness-cc6733aedcfa"">Against cleverness</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<figure><img height=""900"" src=""http://s1.r29static.com/bin/2/1a7//1200x900,100/2073019/image.jpg"" width=""1200"" /></figure>It may not be as trendy as the latest PDRN serum or sleek gadget, but if there's one skincare step that's giving workhorse vibes, it's definitely <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-moisturizer-for-sensitive-skin"">moisturizer</a>. From shielding skin from dry, cold weather to strengthening the skin barrier, proper hydration and moisture (which are two different things, both important: In layman's terms, hydration is more surface-level, lending an immediate softening, plumping effect to skin, while moisturizing locks in hydration via oils/butters to prevent evaporation.) is an essential step in your routine, and one worth investing in.<br /><br />I personally learned (the hard way, might I add) that neglecting moisturizer is honestly, one of the worst things you can do to your skin. As an acne-prone gal, I spent more years than I'd care to admit robbing my face of hydration in the hopes it would curb my breakouts, when in reality, it only exacerbated them since my sebum production skyrocketed as a result of dehydration.<br /><br />As beauty editors, we test hundreds of moisturizers a year, and as such, know a thing or two about the ones that actually work and the ones worth skipping. Ahead, the 12 best moisturizers for dry skin that really quenched our thirst.<br /><br /><em>At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.

For starters, it’s thick — probably the most dense I’ve tried. But it delivers instant, long-lasting relief for very dry, flaky skin, with results that last for hours. When I use it at night, I wake up to skin that looks and feels brand new. That’s thanks to squalane, a humectant that draws moisture into the skin, alongside skin-smoothing ceramides, hydrating niacinamide and cholesterol — a natural lipid that helps repair and maintain the skin barrier, keeping moisture in and bacteria out. The most interesting thing about this moisturizer, though, is the way it dispenses: it comes out like whipped cream. It’s so satisfying and fun to use — which dry skin definitely isn’t.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em><br /><br /><strong>Bubble Skincare</strong> Soft Swerve Barrier Restore Balm, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fsoft-swerve-barrier-restore-balm-pimprod2056176%3Fsku%3D2649406"">Ulta</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1080"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953333.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1080&amp;height=1080&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1080"" /><figcaption><h2>The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + PhytoCeramides Rich Moisturizer</h2><br />“When I need intense, long-lasting moisture during the driest of cold, arid weather, this is what I reach for every time. It's thick, but not greasy, which I know sounds impossible — but not for The Ordinary.

In winter, cleansing my skin can leave it feeling so tight and rough it’s as though it might crack, but when I use this consistently, that never happens. U Beauty promises hydration for up to 48 hours, and it’s all down to five sizes of hyaluronic acid molecules that hydrate every layer of the skin. It doesn’t stop there, though. Skin-strengthening peptides and smoothing shea butter support repair and deliver deep moisturization.

Applying it feels like instant relief, thanks to a trifecta of moisturizing, hydrating ingredients. First up are ceramides, which act like glue between skin cells, keeping skin soft and healthy rather than rough and flaky. Then there’s shea butter, which dermatologists praise for its deeply moisturizing properties, alongside glycerin. Glycerin is both a humectant  (meaning it draws moisture into the skin) and an emollient, helping to keep that moisture locked in. Even though it’s a souped-up moisturizer, it never breaks me out. I must be on my fifth tub by now.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em><br /><br /><strong>The Inkey List</strong> Bio-Active Ceramide Repairing and Plumping Moisturizer, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fthe-inkey-list-bio-active-ceramide-repairing-plumping-moisturizer-P509315"">Sephora</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1080"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953304.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1080&amp;height=1080&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1080"" /><figcaption><h2>Beekman 1802 Bloom Cream Daily Moisturizer</h2><br />“This everyday moisturizer is the GOAT — no, really: It's made with goat milk, niacinamide, and botanical extracts to quench dryness and promote radiant, glowing skin.” <em>— Karina Hoshikawa, senior writer.</em><br /><br /><strong>Beekman 1802</strong> Bloom Cream Daily Moisturizer, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fbloom-cream-daily-moisturizer-pimprod2017582%3Fsku%3D2569244"">Ulta Beauty</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1426"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953785.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1426&amp;height=1426&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1426"" /><figcaption><h2>First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair® Cream Intense Hydration <br /></h2><br />“For very dry skin, it has to be First Aid’s Ultra Repair Cream. It feels like wrapping your skin in silk, instantly calming thanks to oatmeal and allantoin. If I’ve overdone it on the Differin, this is the only thing that helps repair my skin barrier. But don’t just take my word for it — its five-star reviews speak volumes, with users praising the comforting whipped texture, its ability to soothe even eczema, and the fact that it contains no added fragrance or perfume, so it won’t aggravate sensitive skin.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em><br /><br /><strong>First Aid Beauty</strong> Ultra Repair Cream Intense Hydration, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.firstaidbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fultra-repair-cream-intense-hydration-new%3Fvariant%3D52718779695472"">First Aid Beauty</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952985.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1400&amp;height=1400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1400"" /><figcaption><h2>Sofie Pavitt Face Omega Rich Moisturizer</h2><br />“If you're dry and acne-prone, I truly cannot recommend a better moisturizer than <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sofie-pavitt-omega-moisturizer-review"">Sofie Pavitt's Omega Rich Moisturizer</a>.

Beneath the simple packaging, it feels and performs just like a high-end moisturizer. I’d expect nothing less — it’s Korean, after all. This cream cocoons dry, dehydrated, and sensitive skin with ceramides, which act like scaffolding to reinforce the skin barrier without leaving a greasy residue. Fatty acids and glycerin mimic the skin’s natural moisturizing lipids, topping up hydration where it’s needed most. For best results, use it morning and night.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em><br /><br /><strong>Aestura</strong> Atobarrier 365 Cream, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fatobarrier365-cream-with-ceramides-niacinamide-for-skin-moisture-barrier-repair-P515494%3FskuId%3D2844942"">Sephora</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1080"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953327.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1080&amp;height=1080&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1080"" /><figcaption><h2>La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer with Niacinamide</h2><br />“Another excellent formula available at most drugstores is La Roche-Posay's soothing moisturizer, which counts ceramides, thermal water, and niacinamide among its powerhouse ingredients.” <em>— Karina Hoshikawa, senior writer.</em><br /><br /><strong>La Roche-Posay</strong> Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer with Niacinami, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Ftoleriane-double-repair-face-moisturizer-with-niacinamide-xlsImpprod16011007%3Fsku%3D2509730"">Ulta Beauty</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953789.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1400&amp;height=1400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1400"" /><figcaption><h2>Caudalie VinoHydra Sorbet Cream Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid <br /></h2> <br />“If your skin is showing subtle signs of dryness — like flakiness around the mouth or tightness on the cheeks — but you hate that most dry-skin creams feel suffocating, you have to try Caudalie’s VinoHydra Sorbet Cream Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid. It’s more of a lotion than a thick cream, but don’t underestimate it. A blend of hydrating hyaluronic acid, antioxidant-rich grape water, and soothing chamomile extract is complemented by nourishing glycerin and shea butter. Even though it’s packed with all the good stuff, I find it sinks in quickly, leaving behind a hint of dew.

It sits in a comfortable space between a lightweight lotion and a rich face mask, spreading easily and quenching skin instantly.

<p>I’m very lucky to have access to some of the world’s top dermatologists and skincare professionals thanks to my line of work. Whenever I ask them for product recommendations — whether it’s the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"">best retinol serum</a> or the right <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/sunscreen-spf-on-airplane-flights"">sunscreen to wear on a plane</a> — one brand invariably gets lots of love: <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.laroche-posay.us%2F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">La Roche-Posay</a>.</p>



<p>The French skincare brand, which recently turned 50 years old, will likely already sound familiar if you’re a fan of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/drugstore-beauty-products"">drugstore beauty</a>. Its hero products have gone viral many times over, in particular the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fcicaplast-balm-b5-soothing-therapeutic-multi-purpose-cream-pimprod2018263%3Fsku%3D2570171"">Cicaplast Balm B5</a>, which has racked up <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/discover/cicaplast-baume-b5?lang=en"">millions of views on TikTok</a> for its myriad uses, mainly to aid skin repair and hydration.</p>



<p>But all this immense social media hype isn’t merely skin deep. La Roche-Posay is a leading brand in <a href=""https://www.lorealprofessionalskincare.com/lrp/clinical-studies"">research on the microbiome</a>, aka the trillions of microorganisms (think friendly bacteria, fungi, and so much more) that make up the largest organ of the body — the skin. What’s more, most of its product range contains thermal spring water sourced from La Roche-Posay, an actual place in France, which is rich in minerals that have calming and soothing benefits for the skin.</p>



<p>Don’t just take our word for it. Ahead, we’ve asked leading dermatologists to share their favorite La Roche-Posay products and what they’d recommend to patients with various skin concerns.</p>

The water comes from the thermal springs in La Roche-Posay, France, and is rich in minerals like selenium and calcium, which calm the skin. In the summer, I like to keep this in the fridge and use it as a cooling mist when I’m about to step out of the house (make sure you’re wearing water-resistant sunscreen, though).

<p>“For my patients with atopic dermatitis, eczema, and dry skin, I always recommend the Lipikar AP+M Cream. It’s much more than just a moisturizer: La Roche-Posay has published a <a href=""https://www.lorealprofessionalskincare.com/lrp/clinical-studies"">series of clinical studies</a> showing how its star ingredient, the thermal spring water, positively impacts the skin’s microbiome.

I have dry skin, so I use this moisturizer on my face and all over my body; it’s great at locking in moisture [thanks to ingredients like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ceramides-skincare-eczema-dermatitis"">barrier-strengthening ceramides</a> and shea butter, which soothe and hydrate the skin].” <em>— <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/drheathermd"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Heather Woolery-Lloyd</a>, MD, board-certified dermatologist </em></p>

<p>“I often recommend this serum to women of color, who are predisposed to hyperpigmentation. It <a href=""https://www.laroche-posay.us/melasyl.html"">features Melasyl</a>, a proprietary ingredient that actively targets discoloration. It’s all about prevention: Melasyl blocks the precursors to melanin, effectively stopping the formation of increased pigment in the skin, so you don’t even get the discoloration. For patients prone to hyperpigmentation when getting a chemical peel or microdermal abrasion, I put them on this serum for two to four weeks prior [as hyperpigmentation can be a <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3560165/"">side effect</a> after the procedure]. The serum also contains 10% <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/niacinamide-for-skin"">niacinamide (or vitamin B3)</a>, which helps with hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone.

<p>“I live in Colorado, and many of my patients struggle with dry skin. They’d moisturize with lotions and tell me that their skin still feels really dry. In a lot of cases, they are actually using the wrong body wash. The easiest thing I’d recommend is switching to this shower oil, since it moisturizes while cleansing the skin. The formula is oil-based, so it gives you that extra moisture boost before you even exit the shower and put on body cream. This is a foaming oil, so it lathers up and is great at taking off makeup, dirt, and removing impurities.” <em>— <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/denverskindoc"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Scott Walter,</a> MD, board-certified dermatologist</em></p>

<p>Winter jackets are practical, but the best ones aren’t a supporting act — they’re the main character, serving as <em>the</em> outfit. That’s why we’re all about layering up in outerwear that delivers warmth and <em>wow</em> factor. Whether you’re leaning into the coziness of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-faux-fur-coats-jackets"">faux-fur coat</a> or the versatility of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/womens-fall-jackets"">trench coat</a>, the right winter topper can transform even the simplest look into a moment. <br /><br />This season, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-dresses-for-women"">top winter trends</a> point towards bold plaids (or even more dramatic checks), animal print (yes, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-leopard-print-2"">leopard print</a> is always in fashion), and winter whites (to channel Pantone’s Color of the Year: Cloud Dancer). And for silhouettes, it’s time to pull out your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cape-coats-jackets-trend"">scarf jackets</a> from a couple of seasons back (or invest in a new one) and bundle up in funnel-neck designs (that don’t require a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/oversized-scarf"">chunky scarf</a>). <br /><br />Whether you’re looking for an elevated coat to wear over <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-wedding-guest-dresses-outfits"">winter wedding guest dresses</a> or a cozy cropped jacket to pair with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-matching-sweatsuits-womens"">lounge sets</a>, you can brave the cold in style.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Plaid Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952061.png?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The winter calls for festive plaids, especially on your outerwear. This season, the closet mainstay is refreshed with punchier colors and unexpected silhouettes. Think: vibrant color combos, blazers, and bomber jackets. We’re especially eyeing reversible jacket designs that can transform with different outfits and seasons. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Scarf Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952078.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>It seems like every It-girl on our feeds and on the streets is wearing a scarf coat. The bundled-up silhouette trended a couple of years back — briefly overtaken by the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cape-coats-jackets-trend"">cape jacket</a> — and is back at the forefront. Wear the scarves loosely hanging down or wrapped snugly around your neck (and be sure to also look out for coats with detachable scarves). </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Winter White Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952100.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>A winter essential that’s equal parts cozy and cool, a white coat should be in your closet (or in your shopping cart), especially thanks to Pantone’s Cloud Dancer color and the trending <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hm-perfect-moment-collaboration"">après-ski aesthetic</a>. The best part is that you can go down any route, from sporty <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-puffer-jacket"">puffer jackets</a> and wool cropped coats to faux fur zip-ups and wrap trenches.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Funnel Neck Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952122.png?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Funnel neck coats are one of those <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2025-trends"">runway trends</a> that are <em>actually</em> wearable IRL. The exaggerated high necks aren’t just dramatic, they’re also practical for keeping the wind and snow from ruining your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-makeup-looks"">winter makeup looks</a>. You can find the trendy silhouette across leather jackets, wool dress coats, and even longline vests.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Animal Print Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952143.png?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>Nothing says winter glamour like a faux-fur coat. And an <em>animal print</em> faux-fur coat is an even more bold and playful option. While you can’t go wrong with classic leopards and cheetahs, more unexpected animal prints — like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-cow-print"">cow</a>, zebra, deer, giraffe, and even snow leopard — are trending. There are also non-furry fabrics that can be worn cross-seasonally.</p>

<p><em>You say you want change?</em> Well, the time has come! <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/weekly-horoscopes-january-18-to-24-meaning-effects"">Action planet Mars</a> is entering the sign of Aquarius, encouraging us to push back popular notions and lean into our one-of-a-kind perspectives. The opportunity to express ourselves is here. As a result, we’ll be able to direct our attention toward the future and take steps to set the intention that will help us attain our dream. First, we must get out of our comfort zones and take a leap of faith. Every visionary has begun their journey here. Let’s get it started! The path less taken is ready for us to walk down. </p>



<p>It’s been over a year since Mars was in the Air sign of Aquarius. Now that it’s coming back into orbit, from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/weekly-horoscopes-january-18-to-24-meaning-effects"">January 23rd to March 2nd</a>, we are reaffirming our commitment to causes and striving to give our best to care for others in our community. Mars in Aquarius isn’t shy about giving us the stamina to assert ourselves. Still, this transit does require a more innovative approach to taking a stance and defining our needs and desires. This often marks a time of uprising and rebellion, when we speak our minds and take a stand to assert our personal beliefs. Note that this can transcend in any form — from something as simple as defying the “norms” of relationships to fashion trends to peer groups. We’re elevating our lives to showcase our unique sentiments, feelings, and talents. </p>



<p>While it is fantastic to captivate an audience and to hold personal power, the caveat is that once we get on our soapboxes, it’ll be hard to listen to different perspectives and not force our ideals onto others. Knowing when to slow down and take a step back can be challenging, but it’s essential. To effect change in the world, we must have an open mind and accept that everyone holds different views — even if we disagree with them. However, having an active discourse and debate is a great way to harness the diverse ways people think. A moderator, or mutual acquaintance, should be present to ensure we do not take the conversation too far — especially on January 19th, when Mars and Pluto form a conjunction in Aquarius (this is an astrological aspect that occurs when two planets come together in the same sign and degree) triangulating circumstances.   </p>



<p>Being a social justice warrior will be at the forefront of our hearts and passions. Still, it’s also vital to examine situations that require assistance on both a smaller scale and a collective level. Focusing on social dynamics, injustices, and local issues in our neighborhoods or cities will be necessary. Try to be more involved in politics, voter registration, or even participate in charitable endeavors. Paying it forward will be rewarding on many levels, particularly when it comes to our aspirations to better the common good — a vibe we will feel during the Snow Full Moon in Leo on February 1st. </p>



<p>When it comes to friendships and relationships, we often find ourselves drawn to those who align with our aspirations. Looking at the people who add fun, excitement, and push us to think outside the box propels us to regenerate our lives and be different. Their presence reassures and inspires us to be our best, most authentic selves. We can live freely and authentically, thanks to Mars in Aquarius. February 27th motivates us to take the leap towards confidence and embracing ourselves, due to Uranus in Taurus squaring off with Mars. We’ll want to make a break into the purest essences that define us. </p>



<p>Mars in Aquarius is going to be a moment in which we strive to be greater. We aren’t going to sit back and let life happen. Be bold and daring! By taking a firm stand, we can do our best to implement transformation and evolution — not only in the world but also in our personal lives. The goal is to improve in any way we can, so what are you waiting for?</p>

<p>If 2025 was the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bob-haircut-trends-2026"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">year of the bob</a>, then 2026 is the year that the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/01/11843952/pixie-haircut-trends-2025"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">pixie cut </a>steals the spotlight back.  </p>



<p>Some might say that last year’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/korean-two-in-one-haircut-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">jaw-grazing cuts</a> were just leading up to this moment—and they’d probably be right. We can’t scroll through Instagram without spotting a meticulously carved <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/summer-haircut-trends-2025"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">pixie crop</a>, whether on a celebrity like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/teyanataylor/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Teyana Taylor</a> or an influencer like <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@yeslydimate?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Yesly Dimate</a>. </p>



<p>There isn’t a pixie cut that <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/davidboardman_/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">David Boardman</a> — a hairstylist located at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/cutlersalon/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cutler Salon</a> in New York — hasn’t mastered, and he has a sense of why it’s making a huge comeback in 2026: “It’s all about individuality and boldness,” Boardman tells R29. “It’s a style that blends softness and ease, allowing you to play with volume and texture.”  </p>



<p>Boardman says that you can “slim” it down for a sleek, tapered look or add fullness for a more dynamic shape. “Ultimately, the pixie cut accentuates your best features and brings out your personality in the most authentic way,” he says.  </p>



<p>Spoiled for choice? We’ve done the hard work for you. Our edit of the best pixie cuts is all the inspiration you need to show your stylist. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DLXiJTPqBMI/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Content creator Sia</a> proves that a pixie cut can be chic with this straight-across style. The chopped-in fringe adds a subtle edge, taking it from bowl-like to modern. To achieve that bitty, separated finish at the front, your stylist will cut vertically into the strands as a final touch. </p>

<p>This cut sits in a cozy space between a pixie and a shag. While it’s shorter at the back and sides, hairstylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DEpyRiHMMZt/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Justė Sidabraitė</a> has left plenty of length on top so the curls can be scrunched and mussed up using a texturizing product for added volume. </p>

<p>The way hairstylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/davidboardman_/?hl=en"">David Boardman</a> has cut this pixie makes the model’s hair look sculpted, almost as if it’s been carved. It’s all in the subtle short layers, the face-framing pieces, and the softer, longer sides. </p>

<p>One thing that comes with the territory of being a beauty director is that friends, family, and colleagues always tap me for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dermatologist-skincare-advice-2026"">skincare advice</a> — over text, email, or even in the office bathroom. Unlike a dermatologist or esthetician, I’m not a qualified expert, though I like to think I’ve got a little knowledge under my belt. But one skin dilemma that’s stumping even me is why everyone thinks their <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-inkey-list-advanced-retinal-serum-review"">skin looks so dull</a> right now. </p>



<p>Maybe it’s colder weather, central heating, or a lingering post-holiday skin hangover. Whatever the cause, dullness is a skin concern most of us are dealing with — so I asked a top dermatologist to break down what’s behind it and what actually helps. Without further ado, here’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/citric-acid-skincare-benefits"">how to make dull skin radiant</a> in a few easy steps, many of which you can do with products you likely already have at home. </p>



<h2>What does dull skin look like? </h2>



<p>Dermatologist <a href=""https://drophelia.com/"">Dr. Ophelia Veraitch</a> says that “dull skin” isn’t a medical or dermatologic diagnosis: “It’s a descriptive term used to explain skin that lacks clarity, even tone, and light reflection,” she explains. When the skin’s surface becomes uneven, she adds, it prevents light from reflecting properly, making the complexion appear flat or tired. </p>



<h2>What causes dull skin? </h2>



<p>I hate to break it to you, but there could be a long list of factors behind dull-looking skin. The first — and most obvious — is a buildup of dead skin cells, says Dr. Veraitch. Your skin naturally sheds dead skin cells as newer ones take their place, but some skin types might need a little help clearing them. More on that later.  </p>



<p>Another underlying cause of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-skincare-dry-skin-dermatologist-advice"">dull skin is dehydration</a>, says Dr. Veraitch. While drinking water throughout the day supports overall health and skin, topical hydration through lotions and serums is also important for combating dullness. </p>



<p>Environmental stressors are another factor. Pollution particles, Dr. Veraitch explains, can cling to dead skin cells, oil, and sweat, leaving behind an uneven, lackluster surface. </p>



<p>What’s more, skin inflammation — from conditions <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dermatologist-acne-skincare-advice"">like acne</a>, psoriasis, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sex-trigger-rosacea-flare-up"">or rosacea</a> — as well as hormonal skin changes such as melasma, and a compromised <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-soothing-barrier-support-serum-review"">skin barrier</a> (like dry or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tanning-beds-eczema-treatment-dermatologist-advice"">eczema-prone skin</a>) can all contribute to dullness. </p>



<h2>How can you get rid of dull skin and make it brighter? </h2>



<p>Dr. Veraitch suggests it’s important not to self-diagnose: “The most effective way to treat dull skin is to identify and manage any underlying cause,” she says. “This is why I always recommend seeing a dermatologist first — particularly if dullness is driven by inflammation, pigmentation, or a chronic skin condition.”  </p>



<p>Perhaps you only experience occasional breakouts and don’t have a chronic skin condition. If so, Dr. Veraitch says you can simply adjust your at-home skincare routine — and keeping it consistent plays an important role in improving skin brightness. </p>



<h2>What are the best skincare products for dull skin? </h2>



<p>First up: exfoliation — specifically, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/01/10846449/exfoliating-acids-skin-benefits-risks"">the chemical kind</a>. Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) are especially effective at lifting dull, dead skin cells and revealing healthy new ones. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-glycolic-acid-scalp-treatment-dandruff"">Glycolic acid</a> is arguably the most popular recommendation among skin experts for its ability to brighten the skin, minimize the appearance of hyperpigmentation, and smooth rough texture over time. A leave-on toner or serum applied at night is your best option. </p>



<p>A favorite of mine is <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fglycolic-acid-7-exfoliating-brightening-daily-toner-pimprod2007097"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating and Brightening Daily Toner</a>, which contains 7% glycolic acid. After cleansing, I pour a little onto a cotton pad and swipe it over my entire face and neck each evening, then follow with a simple, hydrating moisturizer. </p>



<p>Seven per cent glycolic acid is relatively high, so if you’re new to AHAs, go a little lower. Beauty editors wax lyrical about <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Ftatcha-the-texture-tonic-P479352%3F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tatcha The Texture Tonic AHA Liquid Exfoliating Treatment</a> with exfoliating glycolic acid and soothing Japanese mugwort, and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fgreen-plum-refreshing-toner-P517632%3FskuId%3D2896272%26icid2%3Dproducts%2520grid%3Ap517632%3Aproduct"">Beauty of Joseon Refreshing Toner</a>, with glycolic acid and moisturizing glycerin.  </p>



<p>If your skin is on the sensitive side, consider lactic acid. Its molecules are larger than those in glycolic acid, which means it absorbs into the skin more slowly and gently — making it a better choice for reactive skin types. Try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fsuper-serum-night-repair-5-in-1-face-serum-pimprod2041036%3Fsku%3D2615447"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Olay Super Serum Night Repair 5-in-1 Face Serum</a>, which combines lactic acid with skin-strengthening peptides, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Flactic-acid-10-ha-2-high-strength-exfoliating-serum-uneven-texture-pimprod2007103%3Fsku%3D2551156"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2%</a>, which contains 5% lactic acid and hyaluronic acid for added hydration. </p>



<p>Exfoliating acids make skin sensitive to sunlight, so be sure to wear a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-sunscreen-spf-reviews"">high-factor, broad-spectrum sunscreen</a> during the daytime.  </p>



<h2>Is retinol good for dull skin? </h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"">Retinoids like retinol, retinal</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tretinoin-skin-benefits-risks"">prescription-strength tretinoin</a> also help improve skin brightness. If you’re a beginner, the same rules apply: go low and slow. Try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fstarter-retinol-us-P520372"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Inkey List’s new Starter Retinol Serum</a> or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP427418"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion</a>. Both contain granactive retinoids, which are formulated to release slowly and gently into the skin, helping reduce irritation. </p>



<p>If you’re a pro, Dr. Veraitch recommends her <a href=""https://drophelia.com/products/anti-ageing-night-serum"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Night Serum</a> with tretinoin, which increases cell turnover and improves overall skin clarity.  </p>



<p>You can use retinol and exfoliating acids in the same routine, but it pays to be smart. The number one rule? Don’t layer them, which can leave your skin sore, sensitive, and dry. It’s better to use glycolic acid at night after cleansing, then introduce retinol a couple of nights later, always following with moisturizer and applying sunscreen in the morning. </p>



<h2>Are antioxidants good for dull skin? </h2>



<p>Once you’ve got your evening skincare figured out, Dr. Veraitch suggests adding one more ingredient to your morning routine: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vitamin-c-alternatives-sensitive-skin"">an antioxidant</a>. There are plenty to choose from, including <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-vitamin-c-serum"">vitamin C,</a> resveratrol, vitamin E, ferulic acid, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sunday-riley-b3-nice-niacinamide-serum-review"">and niacinamide</a>. Each works a little differently, but at their core, they all help protect skin from environmental aggressors — like smoke and UV — that can make it appear dull. </p>



<p>Arguably, the most popular antioxidant is vitamin C, which acts like a force field around the skin while brightening in the process. Dr. Veraitch often recommends <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dermstore.com%2Fp%2Fskinceuticals-c-e-ferulic-with-15-l-ascorbic-acid-vitamin-c-serum-30ml%2F11289609%2F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic</a> to her patients to protect against oxidative stress and boost radiance. It contains a trifecta of antioxidants: vitamin C, E, and ferulic acid. If you’d prefer to spend less, try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fbright-icon-vitamin-c-e-ferulic-serum-pimprod2052406%3Fsku%3D2640211"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">e.l.f. Bright Icon Vitamin C + E + Ferulic Serum</a>. For even better results, apply your antioxidant serum <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-sunscreen-spf-oily-skin"">before sunscreen</a> to maximize protection against UV rays. </p>



<h2>Which facials are good for dull skin? </h2>



<p>Lastly, if you have a bigger budget, Dr. Veraitch suggests a medical-grade treatment, which she says can significantly accelerate results. She likes to combine the <a href=""https://skinspanewyork.com/products/hydrafacial%C2%AE-platinum"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">HydraFacial Platinum</a> — a non-invasive facial that removes dead skin cells — with extractions. “I follow this with <a href=""https://www.clearandbrilliant.com/"">Clear + Brilliant</a>, a low-energy laser that gently but effectively brightens the skin, refines texture, and evens out skin tone.” Even better, there’s no downtime. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nail-biting-best-strengthening-products"">Growing out my nails</a> has never been my strong suit. Until recently, I could barely make it a few weeks before breaking one while doing something as untaxing as zipping up my jeans, let alone facing every nail’s nemesis: the ring pull on a can of Coke. </p>



<p>To give them a fighting chance, I’d take skin, hair, and nail supplements like they were going out of fashion, wear gloves while carrying out even the smallest of chores, and refrain from using my nails as tools to open my mail (we all do it). Frustratingly, none of those things worked. What I needed was some expert guidance. </p>



<p>Over the past year, I’ve collected tips and tricks from nail technicians, dermatologists, and even TikTok’s manicure obsessives. But I won’t gatekeep. These are the six simple, and most importantly, affordable pieces of advice I was given for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/japanese-manicure-nails-trend"">longer, stronger nails</a> that actually worked.  </p>



<h2>I chose cuticle oil over nail hardeners</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.drdanastern.com/"">Dr. Dana Stern</a>, board-certified dermatologist and founder of <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrdananails.com%2F"">Dr. Dana</a>, says that the cuticle is the nail’s natural protective seal. When it becomes dry and dehydrated, it’s compromised: “When this happens, water and moisture can enter the nail unit,” she says. “This causes all sorts of problems, including redness and swelling,” and eventually, the nail could grow irregularly: “Think white patches, bumps, thickening, and discoloration,” she says. </p>



<p>While most nail technicians will trim or remove dead cuticle skin during a manicure for aesthetic reasons, using cuticle oil still offers multiple benefits for the remaining skin surrounding your nails, as I’ve discovered: “Regular application of cuticle oil helps maintain hydration,” says consultant dermatologist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/drzainab.dermatology/?hl=en"">Dr. Zainab Laftah</a>. “Hydration benefits both the nail and surrounding skin by reducing brittleness, enhancing nail health, supporting healthy nail growth, and preventing infections,” she adds. </p>



<p>Unlike nail hardeners, which can make nails a little <em>too</em> hard, session manicurist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/amistreets/?hl=en"">Ami Streets</a> says that cuticle oil keeps nails flexible, withstanding everyday wear and tear. “Cuticle oil is the best product for growing nails — and my most recommended item to add to your beauty routine,” she says. </p>



<p>Dr. Dana recommends her <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrdananails.com%2Fproducts%2Fnourishing-cuticle-oil"">Nourishing Cuticle Oil</a>, with jojoba oil and indigo naturalis, a Chinese plant known to repair and strengthen the skin barrier. Complete with a handy roller ball for easy, drip-free application, it’s an oil I can vouch for, having used it down to the very last drop. Another of my favorites is <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fvitamin-e-nail-cuticle-oil-xlsImpprod17821169%3Fsku%3D2523202"">Sally Hansen Vitamin E Nail &amp; Cuticle Oil</a>, with moisturizing vitamin E and a dream team of nourishing plant oils. Streets also loves <a href=""https://amzn.to/42WVpGa"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">L’Occitane Shea Nail &amp; Cuticle Oil</a>, which is twice as moisturizing as the impressive hand cream in the same collection, and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjessicacosmetics.com%2Fproducts%2Fphenomen-oil"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jessica Phenomenoil</a>, another oil we’ve both used up.    </p>



<p>Besides ingredients, exactly how you use your cuticle oil matters, too. Streets says that a single drop on each cuticle is ample — and it’s best applied at night to give the oil time to absorb. Not only does cuticle oil hydrate deeper than hand creams, but Streets and Dr. Dana say that the massaging motion could help stimulate circulation and promote nail growth, too.  </p>





<h2>I switched from traditional gel to builder gel — or BIAB</h2>



<p>Not all gel nail polish is created equal. On my brittle nails, most would chip quickly. I’d then pick off the polish and damage my nails even further. It wasn’t until a fellow beauty journalist recommended <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hard-biab-manicure-strengthen-weak-nails"">Builder in a Bottle</a> — also known as BIAB or builder gel — that my nails grew long and strong. I’m almost a year in, and I haven’t had a single chip or break. They’re growing so quickly that I always ask my nail technician to cut them down. </p>



<p>“Builder in a Bottle is a specific type of gel that lends strength and structure to natural nails,” explains Streets. Thanks to its stronger base, Streets says that it’s a great option for those who want to reinforce their nails while trying to grow them, as they can last up to three weeks. Another great thing about BIAB is that it can be infilled, says Streets. This involves getting the grown-out gap near your cuticles filled in with more gel, rather than having to fully remove the polish each time. “This allows natural nails to maintain growth,” adds Streets, but she recommends a maximum of two to three repeated infills before having a short break to keep your nails healthy and happy.</p>



<p>Thanks to BIAB’s harder, more durable finish, Dr. Dana says that it not only serves as a “protective armor” for nails, but it typically has a forgiving, less damaging removal process by soaking off, so it tends to be more advantageous than other nail enhancements like acrylics. “I’ve seen patients who use BIAB and have very healthy nails in comparison to my patients who wear acrylics and do constant soak-off gels,” she says, adding that BIAB’s durable nature also makes it a good option for nail biters. </p>



<h2>I addressed my vitamin D deficiency</h2>



<p>When a blood test revealed that my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vitamin-d-myth-sunscreen-dark-skin"">vitamin D</a> levels were low, I began taking a 2000 IU vitamin D supplement daily alongside my trusty omega-3, 6, and 9. While there are multiple health benefits to both, Dr. Laftah points out that they could have additional advantages for nails: “Addressing a vitamin D deficiency can improve nail health as low levels can result in brittle nails,” she tells me. Interestingly, <a href=""https://ijdvl.com/nails-in-nutritional-deficiencies/"">one small study</a> suggests that hapalonychia — a condition that causes nails to become soft and prone to breakage — has been associated with vitamin D deficiency. As for omega-3? “Incorporating omega-3 fatty acids into your diet may also benefit nails by providing essential nutrients that support overall nail strength and integrity,” Dr. Laftah says.</p>



<p>However, Dr. Dana points out that no robust studies prove that vitamins or supplements benefit nail health. But since nails are made of keratin (a type of protein), she suggests that if your diet lacks sufficient protein, it may be worth considering protein supplementation to improve the condition of your nails. Streets also advises incorporating more protein into your diet and drives home the importance of staying hydrated. </p>



<p>Before adding supplements to your routine, consult your doctor to ensure they’re safe and suitable for you.</p>



<h2>I took hand cream very seriously</h2>



<p>Previously, I’d only use lotion when my hands were uncomfortably dry and on the verge of cracking. Over the past few months, though, I’ve <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-hand-cream-dry-skin"">taken moisturizing very seriously</a>, and I’m convinced that keeping my hands adequately hydrated throughout the day has also benefited my nails. </p>



<p>I was right. For clients who want longer, stronger nails, Dr. Laftah recommends moisturizing regularly to maintain hydration. “Using a nourishing and hydrating hand cream can help,” adds Streets. “Not only does it keep skin in a supple and soft condition, but it can also act as a protective barrier against environmental stressors,” — like cold weather. Streets says that dry, cracked skin and cuticles can lead to infection or weak nail growth, so consistent daily use of a moisturizing product is essential. </p>



<p>If you want fast hydration without the sticky feel, I love <a href=""https://amzn.to/4jIh9eJ"">Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Hand Cream</a>. If your hands are especially dry, my all-time favorite hand lotion is <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fca%2Fen%2Fproduct%2Fhand-creams-P307907"">L’Occitane Shea Butter Hand Cream</a>. The silky soft feeling sticks around for hours — even post-hand-wash. “On application, make sure you use a massaging motion,” advises Streets. “It can help to boost blood flow to hands and cuticles, which supports new nail growth even further.”</p>



<h2>I started using a glass nail file</h2>



<p>Dr. Dana believes that many nail files, particularly traditional, rough emery boards, can be too abrasive for natural nails, potentially causing “microscopic tears” that lead to splits and breakage. That’s where glass or crystal nail files come in. On days when I gave my nails a break from BIAB, I’d file away rough edges with a glass file, which I’m certain is kinder on nails. </p>



<p>“In contrast [to emery boards], glass creates a perfectly smooth, split-free edge to the nail,” says Dr. Dana, who uses the <a href=""https://amzn.to/3CH5w7g"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Precision Glass File</a>. Likewise, Streets believes that a glass nail file is a worthwhile investment for at-home manicures: “They provide a finer and more controlled filing experience, and the smooth edges help seal the keratin layers at the nail’s edge, preventing splitting, peeling, and snagging that can occur when using a rougher emery board.” What’s more, Streets points out that glass nail files are non-porous and can be washed or sanitized between uses.</p>



<h2>Lastly, I exfoliated my nails</h2>



<p>With its ability to exfoliate the skin, leaving it smoother and brighter, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-glycolic-acid-scalp-treatment-dandruff"">glycolic acid</a> is a staple in many skincare routines, but it can benefit your natural nails, too. In between BIAB appointments, I’ve often applied a glycolic acid toner to my nails and cuticles using a cotton swab, then followed with a glug of cuticle oil. The result? Fewer flakes and a stronger, smoother canvas for nail polish. If you’d rather not DIY, try the Dr. Dana <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fnail-renewal-system-set-30-value%2F7951571%3Forigin%3Dcategory-personalizedsort%26breadcrumb%3DHome%252FBrands%252FDr.%2520Dana%26color%3D000"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nail Renewal System</a>, a once-weekly, 3-step nail system that boasts glycolic acid, a nail primer, and a hydrating gel-oil to reveal healthy, hydrated, and shiny nails, fast. “It’s perfect for brittle, peeling, weak nails, post-gel damage, or if you simply want a gorgeous, healthy-looking shine without having to go to the salon,” says Dr. Dana. </p>

<p>As a beauty director, it’s hard not to be a skeptic. With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-skincare-dry-skin-dermatologist-advice"">dermatologists on speed dial</a> and cosmetic chemists just an Instagram DM away, I can bust dubious <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/acne-skin-condition-tips-advice-dermatologist"">skincare myths</a> (sorry, you can’t put <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/skincare-products-you-dont-need"">collagen back into your skin</a>), and get their opinion on ingredients (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hyaluronic-acid-skin-benefits"">hyaluronic acid</a> isn’t all it’s cracked up to be). But having such a wealth of information at my fingertips means that I’ve become very particular about which products earn a spot on my bathroom shelf. </p>



<p>I’m not sold on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/skincare-products-you-dont-need"">neck cream</a>, nor am I a huge fan of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hair-care-products-you-dont-need"">hair gummies</a>, and until recently, there wasn’t any room for hair growth serums, shampoos, or conditioners in my routine. Honestly, I thought they were futile. Here’s the thing: Having spoken to a handful of trichologists over the years, I know that hair growth is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-grow-long-healthy-hair"">mostly down to genetics</a>. When it comes to hair growth shampoos, especially, they tend to sit on the scalp for a short amount of time, and whether they actually do anything has long been disputed by experts. That said, it’s been hard to ignore the buzz around one hair growth brand lately. </p>



<p>Enter: <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.typebea.com%2F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Typebea</a>, the invention of singer-songwriter Rita Ora and Anna Lahey, also the founder of supplement brand <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.vidaglow.com%2F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Vida Glow</a>.</p>



<p>When Typebea launched in April of 2024, it took many of my beauty editor peers by surprise. A handful extolled the virtues of the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.typebea.com%2Fproducts%2Fstrength-length-conditioner-1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Strength + Length Conditioner, $26</a>, which had made their hair feel “like silk”, while others loved that the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.typebea.com%2Fproducts%2Fovernight-boosting-peptide-1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Overnight Boosting Peptide Serum, $52</a>, gave them three times as much volume. Unconvinced, however, I put my samples aside. It wasn’t until I’d booked in for a salon blowout, where I happened to have my hair washed and professionally styled using the brand’s products, that I sat up and took note. It was probably the best my lengths had looked (voluminous and shiny) — and felt — (thick and strong) in a long time. I incorporated the shampoo, conditioner, and serum into my haircare routine that weekend. </p>





<p>After a month or so of using all three products, I started to get compliments on how long and healthy my hair appeared: “Are you wearing extensions?” and “Didn’t you have a bob a few moments ago?” are just a couple of common questions I’ve fielded of late. A couple of months since I started using Typebea — and now on my second bottle of shampoo — my friends can’t quite believe how quickly my hair is growing. Even my hairdresser, who listened to me moan about how my lengths took forever to reach my shoulders, is stunned by the abundance of new baby hairs that have suddenly sprouted along my hairline. </p>



<p>Besides <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grow-out-bob-hair-care-expert-advice"">taking more care of my hair</a> (not going to bed with it wet, investing in a microfibre towel), using the shampoo, conditioner, and serum consistently is the only significant change to my routine. It got me thinking: <em>Have I got hair growth products all wrong? And what is it about Typebea that seems to work so well?</em></p>



<h2>What are the ingredients inside Typebea hair growth products?</h2>



<p>Without subjecting you to a science lesson, both the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.typebea.com%2Fproducts%2Fovernight-boosting-peptide-1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">G1 Overnight Boosting Peptide Hair Serum, $52</a>, and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.typebea.com%2Fproducts%2Fstrength-length-shampoo"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Strength and Length Shampoo, $26</a>, feature the ingredients baicapil, salicylic acid, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vitamin-b5-hyaluronic-acid-serum-combination"">provitamin B5</a>. The brand claims that they promote hair growth, exfoliate the scalp, and keep it moisturized respectively. The <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.typebea.com%2Fproducts%2Fstrength-length-conditioner-1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Strength and Length Conditioner, $26</a>, also boasts baicapil and provitamin B5, with the addition of plant-based keratin, said to smooth frizz, repair damage, and enhance shine. Intrigued — and still a little bit doubtful — I asked independent trichologists for their thoughts on the ingredients inside everything. Mainly, I wanted to know whether I really <em>did</em> have some genuinely game-changing hair growth products on my hands. </p>



<h2>What is baicapil — and is it good for hair growth?</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.ukhairconsultants.com/"">Eva Proudman</a>, consultant trichologist FIT IAT, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grow-out-bob-hair-care-expert-advice"">previously told R29</a> that baicapil is a plant-based ingredient derived from scutellaria baicalensis, a Chinese herb. “[This herb] has antioxidant properties that can support hair health,” said Proudman. “It is normally combined with other botanicals such as soy, which hydrates the hair and scalp, and can improve hair texture by smoothing the cuticle,” essentially making lengths appear shinier. Proudman pointed out that wheat sprouts are also used in the products. “Wheat sprouts can help to improve texture by reducing the effects of free radicals [think UV and pollution] and provide hydration and a smoothing [effect] for the hair fibre.”  </p>



<p>Jade Summers, resident trichologist at <a href=""https://hareandbone.co.uk/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hare &amp; Bone</a> salon, told me that she isn’t too familiar with baicapil, but she drew my attention to a 2018 study, which evaluated the effects of the ingredient in <a href=""https://www.opastpublishers.com/open-access-articles/a-study-to-evaluate-the-efficacy-of-baicapil-formulations-in-treatment-of-telogen-effluvium.pdf"">telogen effluvium</a>, essentially hair shedding. The research presented positive outcomes for reducing hair shedding, promoting growth, and overall hair density — basically, the amount of hair per square inch on the scalp. </p>



<p>Less hair shedding is certainly something I’ve noticed since using all three products. While losing some hair is completely normal, there are far fewer strands to collect from the bottom of the shower when I wash it. I’m putting this down to the scalp serum, which is so lightweight that it doesn’t feel like you’ve got anything on your scalp at all. Before bed, I simply part my hair, drop the serum onto my scalp, and massage it in. My hair also looks and feels thicker, which I’ll attribute to the shampoo. When I rinse it out, it feels as though my strands have tripled in size, and this volume persists even when I rough-dry and style my hair afterward. </p>



<h2>What is salicylic acid — and is it good for hair growth?</h2>



<p>Besides baicapil, Typebea’s shampoo features salicylic acid, an alpha hydroxy acid (or AHA), which penetrates into the skin on the scalp to exfoliate on a deeper level. Summers explained that salicylic acid breaks down build-up on the scalp (think sebum, remnants of dry shampoo, and other styling products) to unclog hair follicles and create a clean environment for healthy hair growth. Salicylic acid also exfoliates dead skin cells, said Proudman, helping to keep the follicles clear. </p>



<p>One of the most useful things I’ve learned from trichologists is that healthy, stronger hair is largely dependent on the condition of the scalp, which is why it’s recommended to wash it <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hair-training-tiktok-trend"">as regularly as you can manage</a>. Some experts liken the scalp to a flowerbed: If you’re looking after the soil, you’re looking after the flowers that grow from it. For that reason, salicylic acid is something I look for in all shampoo formulations. The fact that it’s pretty high up on the ingredient list in Typebea’s shampoo is most likely why my persistent flakes have subsided — and why my hair looks and feels so much healthier.  </p>



<h2>What is provitamin B5 — and is it good for hair growth?</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11852646.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>The third star ingredient in Typebea’s shampoo and conditioner is provitamin B5, also known as panthenol. Summers pinpointed a 2021 study, which concluded that the ingredient can “elongate the anagen phase in hair follicles” — in essence, the active growth phase. The more time hair stays in this phase, the longer it can grow. Besides this, Proudman explained that provitamin B5 can encourage hair to hold on to moisture, therefore smoothing it, enhancing shine, and even protecting it from damage. </p>



<p>With this information in mind, I’m convinced that the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.typebea.com%2Fproducts%2Fstrength-length-conditioner-1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Strength and Length Conditioner</a> keeps split ends at arm’s length, and even though I’ve been using more heat on my hair, it doesn’t feel dry in the slightest. </p>



<p>Lastly, while most conditioners feature silicones for shine and softness, Typebea swaps these for plant-based keratin. “[Plant-based keratin is] great to smooth and hydrate the hair without any concern of build-up,” said Summers. I have nothing against silicones in haircare — actually, I welcome them — but they can weigh fine hair down if not washed out properly, so plant-based keratin is probably a better choice for those with a similar concern.</p>



<h2>Are Typebea products any good?</h2>



<p>Science aside, the anecdotal evidence for Typebea’s hair growth products is mounting. Don’t just take my word for it. On TikTok, users are looking to the scalp serum to <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@txzthai/video/7400357522659396869"">regrow edges</a>, while other reviewers are taking to Sephora to <a href=""https://www.sephora.co.uk/p/typebea-g1-overnight-boosting-peptide-serum-100ml"">share impressive results</a>, complete with before and after pictures. </p>



<p>Over the years, I think I’ve built a strong reputation for telling you when certain products or ingredients aren’t worth your time and hard-earned money. But even I have to admit that Typebea is a valuable investment for those who want longer, stronger, and healthier hair. In fact, I’m gearing up to open my third bottle of shampoo this week…</p>

<p>It was the first time in 12 years that Gaby had <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/estranged-dad-cancer"">spoken to her father</a>. It didn’t go well. Her sister had persuaded her to hear him out after years of trying. <em>Okay</em>, thought Gaby — so long as she didn’t have to promise a certain outcome. Sitting across from her dad, she felt her heart sink when he said he “didn’t want to drag stuff back up,” as he put it. The thing is, she did want to discuss things from the past. It was important to her, if they were to become civil at the end of this, though that outcome was looking increasingly unlikely with each minute that passed. </p>



<p>“He denied multiple events, lied, denied knowledge of my mental health issues and told me it seemed like there was nothing he could do to change my mind about our relationship, so why should he bother,” remembers Gaby, who is 25 and didn’t want to share her last name. He didn’t apologize for anything and spoke about his own upbringing in a way that Gaby felt was designed to “guilt trip” her into having a relationship with him. “I had the conversation as a favor to my sister. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/07/11466376/latine-family-parent-estrangement"">I will not be doing that again</a>. He seems to have worked on himself over the years from what my sister says, but not in regards to his relationship with me.” Gaby feels that further efforts to reconcile would be futile. </p>



<p>Estrangement is so painful because good familial relationships are automatically expected. In the years that <a href=""https://variety.com/2024/music/news/oasis-break-up-liam-noel-gallagher-fights-1236118668/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Liam and Noel Gallagher, the famously feuding brothers</a> of Britpop band Oasis, were in bitter separation, both brothers were asked repeatedly in interviews if they’d work things out. In a similar vein, this week, Brooklyn Peltz Beckham also addressed his own familial situation by making a statement on Instagram saying he “didn’t want to reconcile” with his family, the Beckhams. There’s something about troubled <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/youngest-child-stereotypes"">family relationships</a> that we can’t let rest in the way we do when other relationships break down. Confronting it is painful. The Gallaghers are a unique case, though. Their recent reunion in summer ’24 was made to look easy and their former conflicts a source of entertainment. They also probably had a big motivator: money. Regular estranged or tense family relationships don’t get that material and emotional support. In the US, there are a few (though not many) organizations supporting estranged families, including Together Estranged and PEAK. The UK’s leading charity in helping estranged people cope, Stand Alone, ceased operations in April this year due to financial struggle, and nothing has yet taken its place. </p>

<p>Even if someone dealing with estrangement has contact with other family members, those family members often aren’t equipped or neutral enough to know how to help. Sometimes, involvement from others makes the whole thing one messy hotpot of guilt-tripping, arguments, resentment and a heat that will burn the tongue. Twenty-nine-year-old Ebony, who doesn’t want to share her real name, is estranged from her cousins, who she grew up with and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/siblings-large-age-gaps"">viewed as her brother and sister</a>. They cut her off last year after a wider family feud involving their parents and grandparents. “I get pressured by other family members all the time both directly and indirectly to reconcile,” she says. “There are multiple family members who have tried talking to my cousins, encouraging them to reach out to me. This upsets me, because no one should be going and asking someone to reconcile with someone else. If that person has to be forced, then it’s not worth it. I’m trying my hardest to not let it affect my relationship with my other cousins who I am also close with. But unfortunately it does affect it and it does make things awkward.” The situation has damaged Ebony’s mental health; before the point of no contact, she felt used as a metaphorical “punching bag” by her estranged cousins when the relationship became turbulent. Even if reconciliation were an option, it wouldn’t be easy, and she’d have to confront the verbal abuse she was subject to. </p>



<p>Financially, people who are disconnected from their families lack a support system many of us take for granted. While not every family has the means to help out, even if the will is there, lots of us do have the luxury of being able to return home for a period when life gets hard — when romantic relationships end, for example, or we lose our jobs. Therapist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/eimearom_therapy/"">Eimear O’Mahony</a> says: “Many people who experience estrangement do not have the financial, physical, emotional support of family. This can mean there is a higher rate of financial worry and struggle in comparison to others who have family to help with kids or who know they will have inheritance in the future.” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>It’s possible to love a family member and need to set limits due to their behavior.</p><cite>Liz Kelly</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Therapy can help with the guilt that often comes from cutting contact with family. Writer Fern Schumer Chapman, who was estranged from her brother for over 40 years, wrote in her book <em>Brothers, Sisters, Strangers</em> that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eldest-daughter-syndrome-oldest-sibling-family-responsibilities"">when siblings cut ties</a>, they’re left in “a world of secrecy and shame,” even if they’ve made the right decision for themselves. The feelings that come with this decision are complex and will vary by person depending on why they’ve chosen to cut ties. Liz Kelly, therapist and author of <a href=""https://a.co/d/5PMM7E8""><em>This Book Is Cheaper Than Therapy</em></a>, says: “It is very common for people who cut ties with family members to experience guilt. They may have received societal, cultural or religious messages to put family over everything. It’s challenging to make a different choice when facing that pressure.” </p>



<p>People are complicated and some still care about family they’ve cut out of their lives. “It’s possible to love a family member and need to set limits due to their behavior,” Kelly explains. “For example, you might love your father, who is addicted to alcohol, and make a decision not to visit him to protect yourself and your children from his violent behavior. These decisions are complicated. Most people who cut ties with a family member typically do so after much thought, deliberation and previous attempts to continue and repair the relationship.” O’Mahony adds that estrangement can feel similar to grieving at times, because “it often doesn’t feel natural to the human mind to accept that we choose to not see, for example, a parent.”</p>



<p>Gaby feels lucky that her mom respects her decision to remain estranged from her dad but she can sense that her mom hopes they will have a relationship one day. Even that must feel like a weight to carry. “Over the years there were a few attempts within the family to ‘fix’ things, including family counseling. But each time he would say or do something that reaffirmed that I didn’t like him as a person, didn’t think he was a good dad and didn’t want him in my life,” Gaby says. </p>



<p>Some people are better off not reconciling, even with the emotional and financial strife it may cause. O’Mahony says it boils down to whether rebuilding the relationship would be “harmful or detrimental to the physical, emotional or psychological health of an individual.” These cases often involve trauma, abuse, neglect and harm, she explains. “Many people who decide to cut contact will go through waves of wondering, <em>Am I doing the right thing?</em> so the decision to not reconcile is only one part of a very complex process. It is so important to have support, understanding and non-judgement.” Lots of O’Mahony’s clients experience stigma surrounding this subject — friends don’t know what to say when it is brought up, or when questions like “Who are you spending Christmas with?” are asked. “The judgement, confusion and lack of understanding from others can be very harmful.” O’Mahony recommends therapy for those who can access or afford it. As Gaby puts it regarding her own situation: “As time has gone on, I have only experienced more reasons to keep him out of my life.” The best thing we can do is let estranged people live in peace with their choices. </p>
