<p><a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/search/projects/categories/public-space"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Public space</a> is often understood as belonging to no one in particular, collectively accessible yet institutionally maintained, yet a growing number of initiatives are challenging this assumption by testing shared management and distributed ownership models.

It serves as a supplementary public space for citizens and tourists to relax by the river and for events. The concept originates from the site; the high-pile dock, shipbuilding cranes, pump house, and flood control wall all evoke memories of the industrial history of the Zhonghua Shipyard. The super-scale shipyard machinery and infrastructure on the site presents a state of being static yet potentially dynamic. We hoped to extend this site character into the design of the Floating Cabin, transforming it into a contemporary architectural space that transcends conventional types. ""Cabin"" refers to the mechanical aesthetics of the shipyard industry, and also to a functional space that accommodates variable content; while ""floating"" represents a suspended structural state.</p>",

<p>High grasses, two shrubs, and an oak. Somewhere in the 1970s, a row of dilapidated workers' houses had to be demolished here. Nothing remained of it, and nothing was put in its place.

<p>In <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/contemporary-architecture"">contemporary architectural</a> discourse, scale is often mistaken for influence. Large firms, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/built-projects"">landmark projects</a>, and <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/search/projects/categories/mixed-use-architecture"">master-planned developments</a> dominate visibility. It goes on to reinforce the idea that architectural ambition is measured by size, reach, or spectacle. Yet across <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/ad-india-building-for-billions"">India</a> and similar contexts, a quieter but equally consequential body of work is emerging. It is led by small but mighty practices operating with limited resources, close client relationships, and an intimate understanding of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/local-design"">local conditions</a>.</p>",

<h4>“The medium is the message” — Marshall McLuhan</h4><figure><img alt=""“How the Tools We Use Change the Products we Design” — banner image."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-H8x4axWhYP0QCL9rRws4w.png"" /><figcaption>Background art by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1876.</figcaption></figure><p>Every era of product design on the web brings with it new design tools, these tools change how we design websites and also influences the next generation of design tools to come.</p><p>I know it seems like a novel idea for some of you reading this, you might think you design the websites you want to design and you’re only limited by your imagination, but you’re only half-right.</p><p>That’s somewhat true but also you’re human and all humans are lazy sometimes and we like to design websites that are easily designed and easily developed, we don’t like friction, as any designer who studied UX already knows.</p><p>So as Marshall McLuhan once said “The medium is the message”, meaning that our ever-changing medium does box us into certain realities as we approach the tools for web design.</p><p>In this article I’ll try to go over the different tools for designing the web as they were used in chronological order, of course some of these tools got used simultaneously so there is no clean cut.</p><p>But I’ll do my best to paint the history of web design tools in stages as I lived through them, so let’s begin.</p><p>First, we had plain HTML.</p><h3>HTML</h3><p>Before any design tool ever existed, there was HTML, it was (and still is) the most fundamental building material of the web.</p><p>When HTML was the only way to design websites we had WYSIWYG interfaces to better move around what was essentially just HTML tags like paragraphs, headings, tables and images.</p><p>CSS didn’t exist yet so all the styling was done inside of the actual HTML itself (remember <em>bgcolor</em>?) and the only way to center anything was to use tables and make their borders invisible.</p><p>In some ways simple HTML styling lives on today in email newsletters and passion projects but the web itself has moved on to better things.</p><p>Websites of this area were made to emphasis the tags and their aesthetics were unique with lots of GIFs, lots or background images that repeated themselves endlessly, and of course some background music to set the mood.</p><p>The most well known offender in this category of early 90s websites was GeoCities, which did offer a WYSIWYG editor for everybody to use for free.</p><figure><img alt=""GeoCities web editor was one of the first publicly available WYSIWYG editors."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/0*YLJ_Xt0xreCr6UIh"" /><figcaption>GeoCities web editor was one of the first publicly available WYSIWYG editors.</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=""Netscape Composer live edits, image from Pier-Luc Brault’s Blog."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*83CyO7vFFtTOROrC.png"" /><figcaption>Netscape Composer live edits, image from Pier-Luc Brault’s Blog (<a href=""https://plbrault.com/blog-posts/i-used-netscape-composer-in-2024/"">Link</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Websites of that era were built for Netscape or later for Internet Explorer, nobody ever tried to make their websites cross compatible and they all just worked sometimes.</p><p>These compatibility issues often occurred while using specific tags (that aren’t in use anymore) like lots of <em>marquee</em> tags, <em>framesets</em>, <em>blink</em> tags and more.</p><p>Those were visually unique but ultimately were deprecated for accessibility and/ or security reasons, so we could only find them in early web design relics.</p><p>Speaking of security concerns, then came Flash</p><h3>Flash</h3><p>When Macromedia Flash (later — Adobe Flash) became the standard tool everyone was both a designer and a developer, Flash had its own scripting language called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript""><em>ActionScript</em></a> and it’s own animation-driven interface.</p><p>As a result people started replacing their entire websites with Flash sites, these sites were very animated and very tailored to their needs, no more templates and no more copying HTML tags from one another (Flash sites were nutritiously closed off — unlike HTML “<em>view source</em>” feature)</p><p>Flash transformed the web more than any other tool, it made the entire web dependent on its proprietary technology, it made us all developers and animators, and sometimes even game designers.</p><p>As a result those sites were often bloated, since optimization was optional, and they were very unfriendly to SEO, since it was all closed off.</p><figure><img alt=""Newgrounds landing page from the early 2000s."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/0*6Uw-fXM3AN3_hkeX.jpg"" /><figcaption>Newgrounds — If you know, you know.</figcaption></figure><p>But the Flash era was the most creative the web had even been, Flash websites could do pretty much anything we could imagine, Flash games were also a big thing in the mid-2000s, see Newgrounds website above.</p><p>Flash is still alive in the form of Adobe Animate, but today it’s less geared towards websites, since the web had moved on — partly since the web moved to a mobile first web.</p><p>Flash websites were bloated and had security issues but above all else: they weren’t responsive enough to survive in the mobile internet era, when screen real estate and battery life were much more scarce.</p><p>I encourage everyone to read “<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20170615060422/https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/"">Thoughts on Flash</a>” by Steve Jobs, it sums the problems with Flash on mobile devices nicely.</p><h3>Photoshop / Illustrator</h3><p>Photoshop and Illustrator are both Adobe products, they weren’t new at this point but the industry defaulted to them when Flash was on its deathbed.</p><p>When Flash was no longer the dominant design tool for the web, nothing could really fill its place, so the industry moved on to the tools that were already proven to stick around.</p><p>This era of web design felt especially static, as designers only designed Desktop and Mobile websites, with often nothing in between, keep in mind that iPads weren’t a thing yet and/ or just came out.</p><figure><img alt=""An Illustrator-designed website, it was never great."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*3aY-7j9JtQ37VdXa"" /><figcaption>An Illustrator-designed website, it was never great.</figcaption></figure><p>Everything was done manually using hard labor, no automation, no tools to make the process any easier, certainly no specialized tools yet.</p><p>Photoshop and Illustrator are general purpose software — Photoshop is for editing images and Illustrator is for editing vector shapes, none of them were made for web design specifically.</p><p>As a result they had many tools that were irrelevant to Product Design and many relevant tools were missing.</p><p>These relevant/ irrelevant tools were the blueprint for the next generation of tools, that built upon the workflow of Photoshop/ Illustrator and decided what tools to include and what tools to exclude.</p><p>Photoshop and Illustrator as web design tools were never great tools for the job, but they were great at being placeholders until some more specialized tools arrived.</p><h3>Sketch</h3><p>Sketch, for many designers, was just that — a new tool built from the ground up for Product Design (or UI Design, as it was called then).

In the early 1800s, belief didn’t require conviction, it required attendance. You inherited your faith the same way you inherited your surname, and no one seemed particularly bothered by the gap between saying the right words and understanding what they meant.</p><p>People were comfortable with answers being given to them before questions were even asked. Faith was spoken about constantly, often with confidence, but this confidence felt rehearsed. Kierkegaard couldn’t tell if people ever wrestled with or questioned their beliefs.</p><p>Eventually, he realized there was nothing <em>to</em> question. The system had already done the hard part. The role of the individual was to nod in agreement. This created a kind of harmony, but a shallow one… a collective certainty that never had to prove itself against anything real.</p><p>As he grew older, Kierkegaard saw how quickly certainty had replaced belief. Whenever a group becomes too sure of itself, it stops producing individuals capable of doing the inward work that faith requires. People learn to <em>perform</em> conviction rather than <em>develop</em> it. Say something often enough and you can skip the part where you understand (or question) it.</p><p>He noticed another pattern: People spoke confidently about truths they had never encountered firsthand, truths they had never risked anything to understand. And inherited certainty revealed an uncomfortable vulnerability: Once you depend on a system to hand you your conclusions, you tend to move as the system moves… and you move with confidence.</p><p>Kierkegaard wasn’t worried about disbelief. He wasn’t even worried about people changing their minds. His concern was <a href=""https://www.sorenkierkegaard.org/""><strong>unearned belief.</strong></a><strong> </strong>Conviction without scrutiny and identity without introspection. The key here, is that the desire for certainty often poses as a strength, but usually signals the opposite:</p><p><strong>A lack of faith.</strong></p><p>A society can become so certain of its truths that it forgets how to look for them. Faith gets replaced by the appearance of faith. Inquiry becomes unnecessary (and frowned upon), and once that happens, no one notices the cost:</p><p>How easily people trade the effort of trying to understand for the comfort of believing (and being told) they already do.</p><h3><strong>The mechanics of unearned certainty</strong></h3><p>Certainty has a way of sounding like confidence, but Kierkegaard knew it’s usually the result of something else. People reach for certainty when the truth underneath gets a little shaky. It feels safer to defend an answer than to admit the question hasn’t been resolved.</p><p><em>And from here on, when we talk about “faith,” we’re using Kierkegaard’s meaning — not belief in a doctrine, but the inner stance required to live with unanswered questions. If that sounds narrowly religious, it’s a misread. Kierkegaard is describing a stance that shows up wherever people have to act without guarantees: in innovation, in design, in leadership, and many other forms of work.</em></p><p>For him, faith was never meant to be a conclusion. This stance was an ongoing willingness to live with what can’t be guaranteed. But certainty makes a different promise. It offers closure. It lets a person stop examining what they believe and start repeating it instead, resulting in something that feels like strength (even when nothing has been strengthened).</p><p>Systems (institutions) depend on predictability, and certainty delivers. It keeps people aligned, keeps roles stable, and keeps operations smooth enough that no one has to confront the inner workings. Churches, governments, workplaces, even families in their more rigid forms, all learn to reward conviction that doesn’t ask questions. Call it clarity or discipline or commitment, but the effect is the same: the more certainty people perform, the less individual they become.</p><p>This creates a loop that’s hard to break. People adopt certainty because it makes them feel secure. Institutions reinforce certainty because it makes people easier to manage. And the more those two forces reinforce each other, the more faith becomes something referenced rather than lived.</p><p>Unearned certainty has consequences. As it takes over, faith has nothing left to do. The questions don’t disappear, but people learn to avoid them. Individuals learn to shrink to fit the expectations of the system… and the system rewards the shrinking.</p><h3>The altitude where faith stops being allowed</h3><p>Systems don’t eliminate faith outright. They don’t have to. They simply move it to a place it can’t interfere with anything important. Faith becomes symbolic (something you reference or admire) while certainty takes over all the places where actual decisions get made.</p><p>Real faith requires inwardness. It asks for reflection, doubt, and examination. It forces a person to confront what they believe and why. That kind of faith creates individuals, but guess what? Individuals complicate systems.</p><p>But if you lift faith out of lived experience and into abstraction, it stops being disruptive. It becomes something recited rather than wrestled with. You stop practicing it and start admiring it. A system can allow that kind of faith because it never threatens the model. It doesn’t challenge authority or create variance. And it certainly doesn’t create individuals.</p><p>So institutions learn to reserve certainty for the ground level (where behavior happens) and faith for the clouds, where it can’t disrupt anything. Super subtle… super effective. People are encouraged to feel faithful while acting certain. They speak as if belief guides them, but their choices follow the conclusions they were given.</p><p>Over time, faith becomes an ornament. Something safe at a high altitude. And the higher it rises, the less room there is for the kind of faith Kierkegaard actually meant: the kind that forms a self.</p><h3>The modern landscape of managed truth</h3><p>In Kierkegaard’s time, people didn’t have access to the full picture. We do. We have more information, more perspectives, more lived experiences and more context than any moment that came before us. And somehow, the more we gained in perspective, the more firmly we settled into our conclusions.</p><p>Institutions don’t limit information… they package it and hand us interpretations wrapped in language that tell us what a “reasonable” or “moral” person should think. White papers, talking points, abacus briefs, policy summaries — all built to steer us toward conclusions that feel responsible without requiring us to understand the full situation.</p><p>It’s a familiar pattern. You don’t have to comprehend the complexity. You only need to sound aligned with it. Certainty becomes a performance of being well-informed, and systems reward the performance because it keeps everything moving in one direction.</p><p>This creates a strange contradiction. We now have unprecedented access to the full picture, but we rarely use it. We reach for summaries, frameworks, pre-digested opinions, and the moral scaffolding provided by the groups we belong to. We inherit not just the conclusions, but the emotional stance that comes with them. We feel confident long before we comprehend anything.</p><p>Getting information hasn’t been the barrier. The part no system can automate for us is the effort needed to understand the full picture.</p><p>People stop wrestling with ideas because the system makes wrestling feel unnecessary. Certainty is faster. Certainty is cleaner. Certainty signals belonging.</p><p>The tragedy is this: certainty has never been easier to acquire, and understanding has never required more from us.</p><h3>The psychological cost</h3><p>Dependence doesn’t really announce itself. It doesn’t feel like surrender or even like trust. For most, it feels like relief. It’s the relief of not having to hold the weight of your own conclusions. But once that relief settles in, the work of examining what you believe starts to fade because someone else has taken on that responsibility.</p><p>This is where certainty becomes a habit, and habits reshape identity.</p><p>When certainty becomes the default position, people stop defending ideas and start defending themselves. Think about the last couple disagreements you had. They feel personal (not because the topic was important, but) because certainty is doing the psychological heavy lifting. It keeps the self coherent. It keeps your view on the world intact.</p><p>To Kierkegaard, certainty can’t survive examination. It depends on avoiding questions, not engaging them. Faith works in the opposite direction. Faith strengthens under examination. It depends on someone willing to confront whatever might be uncovered.</p><p>Where certainty is rewarded, so is avoidance (or disciplined with guilt if confronted). And avoidance eventually hollows out a person from within. If you can be predictable, that’s a sign of stability. Alignment starts to look like maturity. People learn to treat their beliefs the way they treat their job descriptions: something maintained through compliance rather than reflection.</p><p>But here’s what happens: once certainty becomes an identity, people stop seeking truth. They start seeking reinforcement.</p><p>At that point, who cares about faith?</p><h3>The turn</h3><p>There’s an overlooked difference between certainty and faith, and it explains what I think Kierkegaard worried about.</p><p>When your goal is certainty, you have to win the moment. It demands immediate validation because it can’t tolerate the possibility of being wrong… not even briefly. Certainty must hold up under scrutiny right now, in real time, in front of witnesses.</p><p>Faith works on a different clock. It doesn’t panic when challenged or rush to close the gap. Faith can afford to lose the moment because it trusts that truth will be found over time. Faith plays the long-game, and in doing so, doesn’t look for quick wins because it knows it needs to understand the whole picture. Faith needs clarity. Where questions may be seen as threats to certainty, to faith, they’re healthy invitations.</p><p>This is why faith creates individuals and certainty creates loyalists.</p><p>Systems reward the people who need to win today. They’re predictable. They’re motivated. They’re aligned. People who run on faith (patient, reflective, grounded) are harder to manage. They aren’t in a hurry, and they aren’t afraid of being wrong. The bottom line is they don’t feel like their identity is at stake.</p><p>Once you see the difference, you can see why certainty thrives wherever institutions want control, and why faith survives only where individuals are willing to take responsibility for themselves.</p><p>It’s the same reason creative departments are the first to go. Creativity introduces possibility, and possibility threatens certainty.</p><p>Innovation works the same way. To innovate is to admit you might be wrong — to revise, rethink, even replace what you’ve built. Institutions built on certainty can’t tolerate that, so they cut the functions that would force it.</p><h3>Faith as the work of becoming a person</h3><p>Kierkegaard didn’t argue against certainty because he disliked confidence. He saw what it replaced. Certainty stands in the spot where an individual is supposed to develop.</p><p>Faith, as he meant it, was never about doctrinal agreement. It was about becoming someone capable of truth. This means someone who could be questioned without collapsing. Someone who could change without losing themselves in the process. Someone who didn’t need the comfort of winning today in order to grow tomorrow.</p><p>Systems will always prefer certainty. It keeps everything predictable and everyone aligned. They’re comfortable with faith only when it stays high enough not to interfere. Real faith lives lower… close to the ground, where it forms individuals instead of dependents. And most institutions don’t know what to do with individuals.</p><p>I think the biggest danger is how willingly I see smart people trade the slow, difficult work of faith for the quick relief of being sure.</p><p>Once certainty replaces inwardness, the individual starts to disappear. Once the individual disappears, faith has no reason to exist. What remains is a society full of people repeating truths they never had the chance to discover for themselves.</p><p>Which is what Kierkegaard feared all along: a world where belief is abundant, and faith is gone.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=c7a838135e28"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/truth-and-certainty-c7a838135e28"">Truth and certainty</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

It’s time to raise the bar and prove that the most viable products are the ones that feel human.</h4><figure><img alt=""Hand-drawn sheep, all identitical, face the same direction in a grid layout — baaaaa one. The odd-one-out is highlighted in pink and facing the opposite direction."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZSRvWvjMzqAy0DvT-1J3bg.png"" /><figcaption>Escaping the AI Sludge</figcaption></figure><p>AI is now omnipresent in our workflows, but it's come at a cost: a sea of sameness. Lately, products have begun to look and feel homogeneous &amp; indistinguishable, leading to diluted brands and increasingly sterile interactions. Big tech paves the way for others to follow; It’s time to stop settling for “good enough” and blindly following established conventions. Let’s continue to solve user problems and challenge the attitudes of an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) through the use of craft.</p><p>As explored in a recent <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/26/upshot/ai-synthetic-data.html"">New York Times interactive</a>, an LLM’s output is tethered to its training data, revealing a fundamental limitation we must be aware of: AI is a master of regurgitation, not revelation. By drawing from a finite pool of existing designs, these models produce an exponential volume of garbled content — similar to a game of Chinese Whispers where the quality of the message degrades with every time it is retold. While these outputs meet functional requirements, they lack the distinct emotional character and style typically derived from an organic human-design process, required to stand out in a crowded marketplace.</p><p>In this article, I address a growing concern regarding the current state of MVP delivery in consumer products. We stand at a precarious intersection: the pressure to ship fast is colliding with a rising tide of generic AI outputs. We must dissect how designers can retain their creative edge in this environment and empower them to push back against stakeholders for the product's success. The challenge before us is not just to learn how to use new tools, but to continue to push past what’s been done before and continuously set new standards for the products we ship.</p><p>And so, we need to continue to elevate our craft. We must move beyond the basic utility of the MVP and change our attitudes on experiential standards — creating work that proves, unequivocally, that there is a human behind the design of every screen.</p><p>As popularised by Maya Angelou, American poet and civil rights activist:</p><blockquote>“At the end of the day, people won’t remember what you said or did; they will remember how you made them feel.”</blockquote><p><em>While Angelou may have popularised the sentiment later, </em><a href=""https://speeches.byu.edu/speakers/carl-w-buehner/""><em>Buehner</em></a><em> is the earliest recorded source.</em></p><figure><img alt=""A hand-drawn illustration, by Ryan Gillet, of a two people carrying freshly prepared food from the oven. The pair seem to very pleased with the delights of their cooking."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xgMch7zKNt_CbWfjJDQ3QQ.png"" /><figcaption>Illustration by Ryan Gillet</figcaption></figure><h3>The common misconception of MVPs</h3><p>The MVP, popularised by Eric Ries in <a href=""https://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html""><em>Lean Startup (2011)</em></a>, is often viewed as a functional baseline; it is a stripped-back product intended to prove viability today, with the future promise of augmentation reserved for tomorrow (subject to demand, resources &amp; budget — to name a few!) While many MVPs successfully meet basic user needs, they often fail to deliver a unique or engaging experience. This ordinary quality makes them bland and easily imitated by competitors, making it difficult for a brand to stand out and become compelling.</p><p>To understand the <strong>gap between function and value</strong>, consider a parallel from the physical world: the newly constructed house. At its core, a new build fulfils a functional requirement, providing essential shelter and space. Yet, without personalisation and decoration, it remains a generic structure, a standard configuration of walls and windows that is often repeated worldwide; We’ve seen it all before. It is a commodity, not a destination.</p><p>A house only becomes truly <em>desirable</em> when it transcends its utility. It requires the texture of life: the specific choice of paint, the curated furniture, and the family photos on the mantle. Without these personal touches, the structure creates no emotional resonance. It lacks the essential ingredients that transform a house into a home.</p><p>In product design, as in architecture, the structure is merely the canvas. It’s not until you apply a layer of craft that the screen turns from a habitable space into a valuable one.</p><p>And so, product teams must go beyond just a bare-bones MVP and strive for something desirable. This means crafting a superior user experience unlike other products that meet &amp; surpass a user’s needs &amp; expectations. This approach is crucial for gaining a competitive advantage and establishing a strong, lasting connection with your customers.</p><figure><img alt=""A joyful hand-drawn illustration, by Ryan Gillet, of a couple seasoning their food."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YcfK92q9XNakNjSlCUT3ZA.png"" /><figcaption>Illustration by Ryan Gillet</figcaption></figure><h3>We need to change our attitudes toward MVPs</h3><p>The real issue, in my opinion, however, isn’t solved by a new acronym (something the tech industry already has plenty of!) [<a href=""https://excited.agency/blog/minimum-lovable-product#:~:text=Conclusion-,What's%20a%20minimum%20lovable%20product%3F,bestselling%20book%2C%20%22Lovability%22"">MLP — Minimum Loveable Product</a>]. The issue is that we often fail to build truly <em>viable</em> MVPs from the start. Henrik Ståhl’s article, <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/minimum-viable-whatever-ae78c5ad1e3d""><em>Minimal Viable Whatever</em></a><em>,</em> earlier this year, made me question my work when throwing about the acronym “MVP”.</p><blockquote>How do we know that the minimum thing we’re doing is viable enough?</blockquote><p>A consumer product, put simply, cannot be viable (from a business perspective) without a strong <strong>brand voice</strong> and a delightful <strong>customer experience</strong>. To further the house metaphor, a family is unlikely to have bought the house in the first place if all the inner services of the building were exposed &amp; its walls laid bare. Typically, a property developer would furnish the space to give it the best chance of a sale and further enhance their ROI. And so, maybe the issue lies with companies shipping half-baked MVPs in a need to generate revenue.</p><p>Building an enjoyable and satisfying product shouldn’t be seen as an additional arduous task to be deferred until after the delivery of an MVP. It’s too late by then; users will have already formed an opinion about the product &amp; the wider brand. It’s hard to change someone’s first impressions. Similar to property developers, tech companies would likely achieve a greater return on investment if they were to delay launch until version one of their product was “finished.”</p><figure><img alt=""A hand-drawn illustration, by Ryan Gillet, of a chef revealling a present otherwise hidden by their chef’s hat."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4n6y3DPJpyAzMD6zDMepbg.png"" /><figcaption>Illustration by Ryan Gillet</figcaption></figure><h3>What do I mean by delightful experiences?</h3><p>If “craft” has established itself as the <a href=""https://trends.uxdesign.cc/"">defining design buzzword in 2024–2025</a> in light of AI assurgence, then “<em>delight</em>” is its emotional predecessor — and perhaps its most crucial outcome. While the two concepts are deeply intertwined, distinguishing them helps us understand what actually elevates a product from “good” to “beloved.”</p><p>To understand delight, we have to look past the code and the pixels. When done well, delight is the bridge that takes a user interaction beyond the baseline requirements of functionality and usability. As UX researcher <a href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327590IJHC1304_07"">Marc Hassenzahl notes</a>, true delight isn’t found in the product’s surface features, but in its ability to satisfy ‘Hedonic’ needs — such as competence and stimulation — while seamlessly handling and optimising ‘Pragmatic’ tasks like time efficiencies.</p><h4>What <em>delights</em> us as Humans?</h4><p>Why do some tools make us feel empowered while others leave us drained? As psychologists Edward Deci and Richard Ryan demonstrated through <a href=""https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/theory/"">Self-Determination Theory</a>, our most meaningful experiences are rooted in how well a tool supports our human needs. They identified three essential drivers that must be met for us to feel truly motivated and ‘delighted’ by an experience:</p><ul><li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> The need to feel in control of one’s own actions and choices.</li><li><strong>Competence:</strong> The need to feel effective, capable, and “smart” while performing a task.</li><li><strong>Relatedness:</strong> The need to feel connected to others or valued within a community.</li></ul><p>In the words of Shipra Kayan in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/medium.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fuxdesign.cc%2Fdelight-is-not-cute-flourishes-2a1ce118ced5""><em>Delight is not cute flourishes</em></a><em>:</em></p><blockquote>Moments of delight can only happen when products help people be smarter, feel fulfilled, and avoid mundane tasks.</blockquote><p>We must stop equating delight with cute decorative florishes. Real delight is the quiet satisfaction of a tool that anticipates and fulfils a user’s needs.</p><p>Here are some nice examples I’ve come across:</p><ol><li>Apple: Helping users when they’re not expecting it</li></ol><figure><img alt=""3 screenshots of Apple’s iphone Wifi sharing flow. The bottom sheet appears when a contact is wanting to join a new wifi router, catching the user by surprise."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*324-MA4fv6Bywm_omyz23A.png"" /></figure><p>2. Duolingo — Welcome back message</p><figure><img alt=""a series of 3 screens detailing Duolingo UI recalling when a user has been inactive for a prolonged period of time.

Monzo — Get paid early</p><figure><img alt=""Monzo’s get paid early flow where users interact by dragging the cash illustration down into a wallet to complete the task."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9kJQjy1kOMSyFBptabj-pw.png"" /></figure><h3>What delight is not…</h3><p>To understand the value of delight, we must first dismantle the misconceptions that have diluted its meaning. There is a tendency in product design to treat delight as the “cherry on top” — the final step to be taken only if the budget and resourcing permit.</p><p><strong>It is not decoration.</strong> Delight is not an expensive afterthought or a superficial layer of polish applied to a finished product. Single UI alone cannot mask a poor experience. If the core functionality is broken, no amount of charming illustrations or witty copy can save it. In fact, applying “delight” to a screen in a frustrating user flow often feels more patronising than enjoyable.</p><p><strong>It is not a gimmick.</strong> True delight is not merely a fleeting “wow” moment. Flashy animations or unexpected interactions that are disconnected from the user’s core needs are distractions, not delight. If an interaction dazzles the user but ultimately slows them down or confuses their progress, it has failed.</p><p><strong>It is not a checkbox.</strong> Perhaps most importantly, delight is not a line item on a product roadmap to be marked “done” and forgotten. It cannot be treated as an optional extra, dependent on whether the team has leftover capacity.</p><p>Instead, real delight is the result of a <strong>holistic and intentional approach</strong>. It is woven into the product's architecture from day one, demonstrating that the designers respect the user’s time, intelligence, and emotional state.</p><h3>Delight only works when basic expectations are met</h3><p><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/theory-user-delight/?source=post_page-----4c96e0bf00f4---------------------------------------"">Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs</a> taught us that basic needs act as a gateway to higher motivations (love, self-esteem, and creativity). Our basic survival needs must be met before any higher motivations can influence behaviour. Put simply, you don’t worry about “creativity” when you’re worried about finding your next meal.</p><p>Product development requires the same discipline. We must ruthlessly prioritise utility first. Until the software runs without bugs and the core problem is solved, emotional design is merely decoration. You cannot charm a user who is struggling to log in…!</p><p>This brings us to the crux of the issue: In an era where AI tools are democratizing development and efficiency, utility is no longer a differentiator — it is a commodity. When any competitor can use an LLM to generate functional code or optimise a workflow, simply “working error-free” becomes the bare minimum requirement for entry. To build a product that is not only commercially viable but truly “sticky,” <strong>utility alone is not a competitive advantage — it’s just the baseline. </strong>To create a commercially viable product, teams must move beyond a product that works to a product that <em>feels right</em>. This is where design craft will continue to be a product differentiator.</p><figure><img alt=""A hand-drawn illustration, by Ryan Gillet, of a giant palm guiding the user through their journey."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aBQ3rfdWcQd9YsWkmZsefw.png"" /><figcaption>Illustration by Ryan Gillet</figcaption></figure><h3>Delight vs User Satisfaction</h3><p>Delight and user satisfaction are not the same thing. While both are positive outcomes in user experience, they represent different levels of emotional engagement.</p><p><strong>User satisfaction</strong> refers to a user’s contentment with a product or service. It’s the feeling of having their needs met by achieving something or having a want met. A user is satisfied when a product works as expected, is easy to use, and fulfils its intended purpose. This is the <strong>non-negotiable prerequisite</strong> for quality.</p><p><strong>Delight</strong> goes a step further. It’s an emotional response that exceeds a user’s expectations. <a href=""https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/delight_1"">Delight is the feeling of great pleasure</a>, joy, or even awe that comes from an interaction with a product or service. It’s what transforms a good experience into a great one. For example, a user is satisfied when a mobile banking app processes a transaction quickly. They are delighted when the app congratulates them on their first successful deposit with a celebratory animation.</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong> plays a pivotal role in this distinction. “Think of delight as a crescendo — a powerful, high-impact climax to an experience. However, not every click and interaction in a user flow is going to generate excitement. And that’s ok, otherwise the experience would be overstimulating and just irritating. User<strong> </strong>satisfaction, on the other hand, operates differently: it may offer a lower perceived value in the moment, but it sustains the product experience through a steady, reliable rhythm.</p><figure><img alt=""A pen-drawn illustrative arrow pointing down"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*h93bIqp-7TQQ-z2_LZE7AA.png"" /></figure><blockquote>That’s great and all but how can we put this theory into practice…?</blockquote><figure><img alt=""A simple flow diagram of a typical product delivery roadmap: First the product is designed &amp; developed, then typically the MVP is shipped &amp; then teams give the product personality &amp; soul via a Minimum Loveable Product."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_r_kCziOcO1U6ButNyb7dA.png"" /><figcaption>Is a product truly ‘viable’ if it doesn’t connect emotionally? We need to rethink why personality is often cut from the MVP.</figcaption></figure><h3>Delight is not at the end of a product roadmap</h3><p>Delight should not be viewed as a nice-to-have garnish or a static end destination, as illustrated above — It’s a Foundation. To treat design as a purely functional ‘Point A to Point B’ exercise is like approaching a first date with zero personality or charisma. You may have technically shown up, but nobody builds a relationship devoid of emotion. Would you expect a second date? Absolutely not — and products are no different. <strong>When we strip away emotion, we strip away the incentive to return. </strong>Crucially, if that first encounter is defined by generic experiences that are indifferent, you aren’t getting a second chance. First impressions are notoriously difficult to rewrite, which is why deferring ‘personality’ until after the MVP is a strategic oversight. By then, the user has already judged the brand; if you didn’t delight them at the start, you’ve likely lost them for good.</p><p>Brands that create emotional experiences with their audiences are the most commercially viable (The proof is in the previous example: Apple, Monzo, and Duolingo have already set the gold standard for this approach). While often relegated to the ‘nice-to-have’ category, designing for delight represents a significant, untapped lever for product performance. Far from being an aesthetic indulgence, designing for delight is a high-impact lever for product performance. It drives the metrics that matter most: long-term retention, stickiness, and Lifetime Value (LTV). Moreover, it turns users into a self-sustaining marketing engine, slashing customer acquisition costs (CAC) through natural, fan-led referrals. In this light, delight is a key component of “viability.” <strong>When build resources are tight, emotional resonance shouldn’t be the first thing we descope — it should be the reason we build in the first place.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Whimsical, hand-drawn illustration, by Ryan Gillet, of a waiter or chef in a tall toque lifting a cloche from a serving tray with a flourish."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iSw4Hxb6nGnOUJR4RpL71Q.png"" /><figcaption>Illustration by Ryan Gillet</figcaption></figure><h3>Let’s build desirable MVPs</h3><p>Successful product teams enhance a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) by focusing on a continuous cycle of building, measuring, and learning. The process is not about launching a single, final product, but rather viewing the product as organic and ever-evolving based on an active user feedback loop. In my opinion, the term delight should be intrinsic to the product’s “viability” as it should be a byproduct of a business and product agenda.</p><h4>Strategies the best teams adopt:</h4><ul><li>Establish a <strong>continuous discovery process</strong>, ensuring that every product/business evolution is anchored in real-world user insights rather than assumptions.</li><li>Let the <strong>data lead</strong>: the best teams prioritise development cycles by weighing features against hard metrics and validated user needs.</li><li><strong>Design for the user, not the workflow: </strong>Create resonant experiences that move past utility and acknowledge the emotional intent behind a task, ensuring that completion feels like a win rather than a digital chore.</li><li>Teams <strong>own &amp; champion emotional design</strong>, acknowledging its commercial benefit.</li><li>View <strong>every release as a hypothesis</strong>: replace guesswork with continual validation to ensure product refinements evolve in tandem with user behaviour.</li><li><strong>Delight cannot exist in a vacuum. </strong>Teams prioritise a functional baseline, ensuring products adhere to the highest accessibility standards before attempting to layer on emotional resonance.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Whimsical, hand-drawn illustration, by Ryan Gillet, of a joyful character in a pillbox hat and jacket, waving enthusiastically with energetic motion lines."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yivYkv7DYHnIiWHYXJHgGw.png"" /><figcaption>Illustration by Ryan Gillet</figcaption></figure><h3>Key principles to adopt</h3><h4>For design &amp; product teams</h4><ol><li><strong>Change product attitudes</strong>: Delight should not be seen as an additive or a nice-to-have; it should be baked into our product design experience.</li><li>Even in an MVP, <strong>delight should be intrinsic</strong> to the product’s “viability”.</li><li><strong>How we communicate:</strong> When presenting our work, we should not frame delight as an add-on or an extra. It is the solution that meets the brief. Without the added delight, the product does not perform as well as it could against its goals.</li><li><strong>Hold ourselves to account:</strong> Designing for delight focuses on delivering an emotive experience &amp; unexpected rewards to users, rather than solely on the products themselves. We should aim to make the experience a pleasure, not a chore.</li><li><strong>Don’t ship half-baked features;</strong> ship fully viable products.</li><li><strong>Experiment!</strong> Designers should foster a culture of experimentation and rapid refinement. Through data collection, we’ll build evidence on the impact of delight through in-app tests.</li><li><strong>Continual active feedback loop:</strong> Many MVPs are released without delight, and without action, we will still be descoping delight going forward. However, if we better analyse MVPs post-release, we’ll have an active feedback loop that will inform us where to make enhancements and create a business case for delightful improvements.</li></ol><h4>For products</h4><p>While the pursuit of deep delight may feel utopian, it forces us to sharpen our craft and further brands' relationships with their customers. Consequently, products must:</p><ul><li><strong>Anticipate and Adapt:</strong> Predict user needs and adjust the interface to the individual.</li><li><strong>Deliver Reliability:</strong> Work as expected (or better), every single time.</li><li><strong>Maintain Consistency:</strong> Unify form, tone, and voice so the product feels like a single entity.</li><li><strong>Promote authentic emotion over artificial celebration.</strong> We must stop using “confetti” for benign tasks. Users don’t need a digital party for simply logging in. For example, we must remember that a user doesn’t want a bank account; they want the financial control that an account offers. True delight doesn’t celebrate the tool; it connects directly to the user’s feelings about what they are achieving with it.</li><li><strong>Don’t mistake a functional product for a successful one. </strong>The real competitive edge isn’t just solving a problem — the most successful products are emotive, proving there’s a person behind the solution.</li></ul><h3>References</h3><p>For more illustrations, please check out the brilliant Ryan Gillet! <a href=""https://www.ryangillett.com/work"">https://www.ryangillett.com/work</a></p><p>Luke Murphy, Zero Heights, Building Delight into Your Design System <a href=""https://webinars.zeroheight.com/register/zeroheight-ds-live-luke-murphy-building-delight-into-your-design-system"">https://webinars.zeroheight.com/register/zeroheight-ds-live-luke-murphy-building-delight-into-your-design-system</a></p><p>Don Norman. 2005.

<h4>Another year, another wave of “What to expect in 2026” guides. I’m sure you’ve already scrolled through a few.</h4><p>In this article, the first one I’ll be publishing this year, I won’t make bold predictions. Instead, I’m sharing what I’m observing firsthand while collaborating with enterprise design teams, and from all the news, conversations, and insights I’ve gathered at the many conferences I’ve attended in the past months.</p><p>These are my top 10 UX design shifts I’m seeing for 2026, with AI (surprise!) at the center of it all.</p><h4>1. Explainable AI becomes non-negotiable</h4><p>When users interact with AI tools, many walk away uncertain about what the system actually did or the reasoning behind its decisions. This is a design challenge we can address.</p><p>Products are already displaying their reasoning upfront, communicating decisions in accessible language, and allowing users to intervene when the AI makes mistakes. In 2026, this adoption will accelerate.</p><p>The explainable AI market <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/03/21/3047111/0/en/Explainable-AI-Market-to-USD-33-20-Billion-by-2032-SNS-Insider.html""><strong>is expected to reach $33.2 billion by 2032</strong></a>, as people won’t trust systems they can’t understand. The difference between AI products people adopt and those they abandon may come down to one simple question: do users know what the system just created in response to their prompts?</p><h4>2. Agentic UX and human-agent ecosystems</h4><p>With<strong> </strong><a href=""https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/ai-analytics/ai-agent-survey.html""><strong>88% of business leaders</strong></a> planning to increase AI budgets for agentic capabilities, AI agents are becoming a strategic priority. This aligns with something else happening: users are developing stronger intuitions about where, how, and when these agents deliver genuine value versus when they just get in the way.</p><p>The result is consolidation. Rather than juggling dozens of fragmented agents that each handle one narrow task, master agents will coordinate specialized agents automatically. They’ll route work based on task type, context, and importance, powered by advances in LLM reasoning that make this orchestration possible for the first time.</p><p>Designers must build experiences for these human-agent ecosystems. That means overseeing agent lifecycles, managing handoffs between agents so context doesn’t get lost, and defining the exact moments when humans should step in. It’s a different kind of design problem than we’re used to solving.</p><h4>3. Dynamic, personalized interfaces generated on demand</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0iA1adwwlkh7fMaowp4owA.png"" /></figure><p>Large language models like Gemini 3 Pro now generate interactive, customized interfaces in real-time for individual prompts. Research shows these interfaces <a href=""https://generativeui.github.io/""><strong>matched human expert-designed work 44% of the time</strong></a>, which is impressive given they are generated in seconds.</p><p>Instead of handing off fixed screens, designers will craft constraints, safety rails, and evaluation criteria that shape how these model-driven interfaces operate. They’ll be designing the rules that generate interfaces on the fly, adapting to what each user needs in that specific moment.</p><h4>4. Voice interfaces finally find their moment</h4><p>Voice technology has been heralded as transformative for over a decade. In 2026, it stops attempting to replace typing and begins complementing it effectively. Indeed, in the US alone, <a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/1299985/voice-assistant-users-us/""><strong>157.1 million people</strong></a> are expected to use voice assistants by the end of next year.</p><p>We’ll see context-aware, multimodal experiences rise. These interfaces blend voice, touch, and visuals depending on user actions. Strong UX design accounts for situations when people’s hands are occupied (cooking, driving, carrying things…) or their surroundings make typing impractical, like when you’re in a meeting or walking between buildings.</p><h4>5. Micro-interactions become the language</h4><p>Think back to when those small animations and hover effects were extras designers tacked on at the project’s end, like decorative flourishes. A button shifting color, a progress indicator filling, a brief celebration when you finish a task… we considered them nice-to-have details that made things feel polished but weren’t really necessary.</p><p>These micro-interactions now serve as the primary communication method between interfaces and users. They confirm actions without requiring people to pause and digest confirmation messages and provide feedback that keeps you oriented without interrupting your flow.</p><p>Interfaces lacking them feel unresponsive, similar to conversing with someone who never makes eye contact or nods to show they’re listening. The interaction feels off, even if you can’t immediately pinpoint why.</p><p>To learn more about the importance of micro-interactions and how they enhance user experience, I recommend reading Dan Saffer’s <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Microinteractions-Full-Color-Designing-Details/dp/1491945923""><strong><em>Microinteractions: Designing with Details</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong>and Kolte &amp; Rao’s 2024 study<strong><em> </em></strong><a href=""https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-99-7711-6_2""><strong><em>Exploring Microinteractions in Human–Computer Interaction.</em></strong></a></p><h4>6. AR transitions from demonstration to daily application</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nWBbL0_4h4hSzJMN5O5PmQ.png"" /></figure><p>I’ve attended countless impressive AR demonstrations at industry conferences over the years. Witnessed innovative concepts, watched cool demos, then returned to my desk wondering “when would I genuinely use this for actual work?” The gap between what looked impressive on stage and what I’d incorporate into my everyday workflow was always enormous.</p><p>That disconnect between impressive showcase and practical tool is narrowing. For example, retail businesses enable you to visualize furniture in your space before purchasing. This is now a decision-making tool!</p><p>Design teams are already using AR to evaluate designs in the real world, not just on screens. By placing 3D models into the physical spaces where they’ll exist, teams can identify spatial and layout problems early.</p><p><a href=""https://treeview.studio/blog/ar-vr-mr-xr-metaverse-spatial-computing-industry-stats""><strong><em>Treeview’s Spatial Computing Industry Statistics Report 2025</em></strong></a> shows AR adoption surging, moving beyond demos. This means designers now need to make AR easy to use, reliable, and practical for everyday tasks.</p><h4>7. Personalization that respects boundaries</h4><p>Users want personalized experiences until they realize what the system needs to know to deliver them. Predicting what you need before you ask sounds helpful, but it requires constant behavior tracking to work.</p><p>Consider Netflix’s recommendation engine. It succeeds because users consciously chose a service centered on personalization. Everyone knows Netflix watches what you watch, and that’s the deal you signed up for. Contrast this with retail websites tracking your activity across countless unrelated sites to display ads for products you glanced at once. Identical technology, vastly different user perception of whether it’s valuable or intrusive.</p><p>The best enterprise software gives users control over how much the system adapts to them and makes privacy settings visible. 2026 could mark the year companies master adapting to user preferences without intrusive surveillance, giving you the personalization benefits without the feeling that something’s watching your every move.</p><h4>8. Accessibility becomes foundational, not supplemental</h4><p>Accessibility can’t be an afterthought or a compliance checkbox anymore. In one of my latest Forbes articles, I discussed how <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2025/10/29/the-hidden-roi-of-accessible-design-how-inclusion-drives-innovation/""><strong>accessible design can drive ROI</strong></a> and become a competitive advantage.</p><p>Designing for cognitive diversity from the outset benefits everyone, not just people with disabilities. Motion-sensitivity controls assist people with ADHD alongside those who simply experience dizziness from animations. A clear visual hierarchy helps people with attention challenges and also makes your interface easier for everyone to scan quickly.</p><p>Accessibility will likely emerge as one of UX design’s defining conversations in coming years, considering its capacity to transform how we develop products and who can use them effectively.</p><h4>9. Cross platform UX that works</h4><p>Users are switching between phones, tablets, laptops, and smartwatches multiple times a day. They go to work, take breaks, return home, and expect their experiences to follow them as they move.</p><p>Genuine cross-platform UX means work accompanies you across devices without friction. Initiate a task on mobile during your commute, advance it on desktop when you reach your desk, complete it on tablet during an evening meeting, all without conscious consideration of which device you’re holding or where your files live.</p><p>This will feature more prominently in business discussions throughout 2026 as hybrid work models mature and people expect their tools to be as mobile as they are.</p><h4>10. Biometric authentication becomes the norm</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7grkTeu4pCzhPMnkaiJY-A.png"" /></figure><p>Passwords have been authentication’s vulnerability for years, and the industry is finally advancing beyond them.<strong> </strong><a href=""https://www.portnox.com/lp/2025-ciso-perspectives-report/""><strong>Nearly a third of cybersecurity leaders</strong></a> have already begun implementing passwordless authentication, with another 38% planning to follow.</p><p>People unlock their devices dozens of times daily using facial recognition or fingerprints without conscious thought. That’s established baseline behavior now. Nobody thinks “I’m using biometric authentication” when they glance at their phone to unlock it. It just works.</p><p>Biometrics, passkeys, and FIDO2 standards aren’t experimental anymore. Design teams build interfaces, assuming passwordless authentication as standard practice rather than alternative options. The challenge now is how to make the transition smooth for users still clinging to passwords out of habit.</p><h4>The binding element</h4><p>People can tell when a product is built to genuinely help them and when it’s built to satisfy internal requirements or check off a list of features.</p><p>These UX design shifts respond to that reality by prioritizing products that respect users’ time, intelligence, and privacy. In 2026, success will belong to teams that design with empathy and collaboration, treating users as partners rather than endpoints.</p><p>Good design means designing with users at every step. Everything else is just noise.</p><p><strong><em>Learn more about how SAP approaches human-centered design at </em></strong><a href=""http://www.sap.com/design""><strong><em>www.sap.com/design</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arinb""><em>Arin Bhowmick</em></a><em> (</em><a href=""https://twitter.com/arinbhowmick""><em>@arinbhowmick</em></a><em>) is Chief Design Officer at SAP, based in San Francisco, California.

<h4>Why designing for ongoing reflection matters</h4><figure><img alt=""Image of a character unpleasantly gift wrapped"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YdEqBs6grwOdVyas5r5wmg.png"" /><figcaption>Image of a character unpleasantly gift wrapped</figcaption></figure><p>It’s that time of year again where apps confidently tell us who we are. This year, Spotify informed me that I’m 78 years old in Spotify years (I’m 33 in human ones). I personally thought my affinity for Chapel Roan would have shaved off a decade or two but I guess not! Strava had thoughts about my running habits. YouTube summarized my viewing habits and decided I was an Adventurer, whatever that means. Even LinkedIn had something to say about who I’d been professionally!</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RBtrompAT6QsWV11msQQYA.png"" /><figcaption>Image of YouTube, LinkedIn and Spotify Wrapped</figcaption></figure><p>Honestly I don’t want to be a hater, these year-end wrap ups are fun! They feel personal. They often even feel accurate. But also they create an uneasiness and raise a question I keep coming back to. <strong>How do these systems actually decide who we are?</strong></p><p>At a high level, most of the systems I mentioned learn about us through our behavior. Some of that behavior is subtle, like how long we linger, what we skip, when we hesitate. Some of it feels more intentional like likes, follows, comments, subscriptions etc. In most cases, we’re not carefully declaring who we want to be to our products.</p><p>Over time, we learn that these implicit behaviors function as levers. If we want less of something, we skip it. If we want more, we engage. We adapt ourselves to these janky systems. It’s a very narrow kind of control because we don’t know the weight of each actions on our experience. Then once a year, we’re handed a polished summary of who the system thinks we are. But there are better ways to explore this.</p><p>Awhile ago, I had the opportunity to work on a project for a company called Ground News. Their goal is to aggregate news sources into one place in order to give you a clearer picture of your news diet. Part of how they do that is through a feature called <a href=""https://ground.news/my-news-bias-vantage""><em>My Media Bias</em></a>. This feature returns your media consumption data back to you in a structured, legible way showing what sources you read, how they’re distributed across the political spectrum, and where potential blind spots might exist.</p><figure><img alt=""Image of the design for My Media Bias showing all the different ways to see bias"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yBtPNS4Qc0D9lDAtm47SBQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://ground.news/my-news-bias-vantage"">Image of the design for My Media Bias</a></figcaption></figure><p>The design intent wasn’t to tell people what their biases were, but to make their own consumption data visible in a way that could be inspected and revisited over time. <strong>Over time</strong> is a distinction that matters. Ground’s approach treats visibility as part of the ongoing experience, not a once-a-year summary. That kind of continuous feedback supports insight and intentional adjustment in a way that opaque behavioral feedback loops don’t.</p><p>In truth there’s a reason most large platforms privilege behavioral signals. From a systems perspective, <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4781121"">they work</a>! Observed behavior (what we click, watch, skip, or linger on) is abundant, continuous, and highly predictive of what we’ll do next. Decades of recommender systems research show that these implicit signals consistently outperform self-reported preferences when it comes to predicting future interaction.</p><p>And I can’t deny that, but these signals only describe what happened, not what a person is trying to do. That’s where explicit preferences matter. They’re messier, slower, and harder to collect but they’re the only place intent actually lives. When systems treat stated preferences as secondary or optional. They often sideline the user’s own goals.</p><p>What’s interesting about these year-end summaries is the kind of relationship they establish between the system and the person using it. You can see what the system thinks of you, but you can’t interrogate it, correct it, or guide it in any explicit way. The moment for reflection arrives only after the system has already learned everything it’s going to learn from you that year.</p><p>When assumptions are visible as they’re being formed, users have the opportunity to respond with intention rather than reaction. That’s a fundamentally different kind of agency. It treats people less like sources of signals and more like collaborators in the modeling process.</p><p>Systems that meaningfully shape what we see, hear, and engage with are making value-laden decisions on our behalf. When the only way to influence those decisions is through opaque behavioral feedback, users are left guessing how to express intent.</p><p>Wrapped features are interesting because they acknowledge that people want to understand how they’re being seen. The problem is that so far all of the examples I’ve seen stop short of giving users the tools that would actually support that understanding. There’s no invitation to adjust or say this doesn’t quite feel right.</p><p>To be clear, I’m glad Wrapped exists. I hope more companies keep doing these kinds of reflections. They offer a rare glimpse into how these systems see us, what they prioritize, and where their interpretations fall short.</p><p>The more interesting question isn’t whether Wrapped gets us right or wrong. It’s why reflection shows up as a once-a-year artifact instead of an ongoing conversation. If systems are going to model us continuously, it’s worth asking why we’re only invited to reflect after the fact, rather than participate while that model is still being formed.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9e04820ac1fb"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/well-thats-a-wrap-9e04820ac1fb"">Well, thats a wrap…</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11843538.jpg?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>From <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bob-haircut-trends-2026"">the bob</a> to the bixie, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/01/11843952/pixie-haircut-trends-2025"">short haircuts</a> have become the style of choice in salons up and down the country. Though they all look incredible, they’re also pretty high maintenance. </p>



<p>For those who don’t like the idea of booking in for a monthly trim, a midi, shoulder-length cut might be your best bet. Far from mediocre, the in-between length isn’t only much easier to keep sharp — it’s also being touted as one of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/haircut-trends-2026"">biggest hair trends for 2026</a>. “Mid-length cuts don’t have to feel like a long, grown-out bob,” says <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jordanoliverhair/"">Jordan Jones</a>, stylist and color technician at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/taylor_taylor_london/"">Taylor Taylor London</a>. “This year, we’re being shown that they can be their own style with layers and careful shaping to create volume and movement, or shine and sophistication. If your bob has grown out and your hair has reached that awkward-length stage, or if you’ve got long locks and fancy a change without going super short, a trendy mid-length style is the cut for you.”</p>



<p>On Instagram, London’s most sought-after stylists <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thehairbros/"">The Hair Bros</a> are also championing shoulder-length haircuts with curtain bangs, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/concave-layers-hair-trend"">concave layers</a>, and natural waves. It seems we’ve all got the same idea: Google search for shoulder-length haircuts has risen by 180% recently.</p>

<p>Curtain bangs are going nowhere fast, but according to editorial hairstylist and presenter <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/neilmoodie/?hl=en"">Neil Moodie</a>, you might want to cancel your fringe trim, because it’s increasingly cool to let it grow out a little. “Grown-out curtain fringes are great and can make shoulder-length hair look more interesting,” he says. The more grown out the fringe, the easier it is to blend into the rest of your hair, particularly if you’re interested in getting a handful of layers to enhance volume and texture, like this style by hairstylist <br /><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/nicolasfloreshair/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nicolas Flores</a>.</p>

<p>“As the bob and long bobs have been around for a while, I feel like fringes are making a comeback,” says Moodie. “The type of fringe I mean almost looks a bit homemade and very individual.

<p>You’ve heard of the wolf cut (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/sachel-haircut-trend-the-rachel"">a variation on the shag</a>, occupying a space between wild and relaxed) but ‘the mane’ is a lot more voluminous. “This is super edgy with lots of texture and a heavy fringe that needs to be worn long and in the eyes so it has plenty of movement,” explains <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jordanoliverhair/"">Jordan Jones</a>, stylist and color technician at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/taylor_taylor_london/"">Taylor Taylor London</a>. “The face-framing layers of this cut make it perfect for adding texture and volume to the hair while defining the face.”</p>



<p>So what should you ask for? “A choppy cut with plenty of layers that frame the face and create soft movement,” says Jones. “Think Billie Eilish and Miley Cyrus’s shaggy ‘dos.” Jones says the look works well with any hair texture. “Sea salt products are a must-have to give an effortless, freshly tousled finishing touch.” Take inspiration from this look by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/frankie_inv/"">Francesca Inverarity</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thehairbros/"">The Hair Bros</a> say a shoulder-length cut is its own style and that it’s important not to leave all of the hair one length. “This will end up looking heavy, as if it were a shorter bob. A middy haircut should be full of texture and life and feel fun and playful. It’s great for anyone who wants to cut their long hair short but isn’t quite ready to brave a bob.” Flip your hair to one side for more of a natural, lived-in feel, like this cut on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRkc3d-jAqf/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Alexia Colombo</a>. “As always, just a few products and some air should be enough to style this cut,” added The Hair Bros. </p>

<p>The ’90s lob (aka long bob) is going to be everywhere again this year, says Tyler. “This is a layered, mid-length long bob à la Rachel from <em>Friends</em>. Think of it as a more retro twist on the wolf cut with slightly longer layers and a sleeker texture.” Dreamed up by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/the.labartory?hl=en"">@the.labartory</a> on Instagram, this lob is both glossy and textured.</p>

<p>“Embrace modern glamour with a super blunt cut with clean, sharp lines,” says Jones, like this cut created by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DGCh4ufOwnt/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Emiliano Breit</a>. “This style looks best when cut around the collarbone and is perfectly set off with mirror-shine hair.” This is all about the condition of your hair, so make sure to use hydrating and nourishing conditioners or oils to create a super sleek style. <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fkerastase-elixir-ultime-refillable-hydrating-hair-oil-P511702"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kérastase Elixir Ultime L’Original Hair Oil</a>, is a favorite among stylists.</p>



<p>“If you are a brunette or darker, ask for a gloss color to add depth and shine,” adds Jones. “Even opting for a Brazilian blow-dry or straightening treatment will help to put the finishing touches on this look.”</p>

<p>“Why is shoulder-length hair commonly perceived to be bad?” wrote The Hair Bros on Instagram. “It’s not!” This modern shoulder-length cut by hairstylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/liamrussell.hair/"">Liam Russell</a> on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/didntcatchthat/"">Ruby Tuesday Evers</a> has inspired the Bros’ work in-salon over the past few months. The bedhead texture and mussed-up fringe give the medium length great shape.</p>

<p>The shag, the mullet, the shullet… Whatever you call the ‘00s most popular cut, it always seems to be evolving, as illustrated by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CXn-azRMw9R/"">Emily Kingston</a>, stylist and colorist at <a href=""https://bluetitlondon.com/salons/clapton/"">Blue Tit Clapton</a>. Proving the cut looks just as incredible on curly hair, the trick is to emphasize lots of volume around the top of the head and taper the lengths right down to the bottom so that hair sits just below the collarbone.</p>

<p>The flipped side bang perfectly accentuates a shoulder-length cut, says Jones, like this style on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DGgb_HuORC3/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Billie Brown</a>. “Curtain bangs have moved on, and side bangs from the early ’00s are back. For fringe lovers who want a bit more excitement this year, this style flatters most face shapes and essentially frames the face with disconnected, slightly longer bangs. It’s not dramatic and easy to tuck behind your ear, pin to one side, or sweep across the forehead with a big, bouncy blow-dry.”</p>



<p>Jones says it looks great on wavy, thicker hair in particular, styled as if it’s been casually flipped over. “To keep it on trend, it’s best worn loose and tousled. Add spritzes of dry shampoo on the roots for second-day hair to amplify the volume and add a bit of texture.”</p>

My first mistake was assuming that, having <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glow-recipe-blackberry-retinol-blemish-serum-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">used retinol before</a>, I wouldn’t experience the harsh side effects of a stronger formula. But when my skin wouldn’t stop peeling, my breakouts got worse, and I was almost out of the tube, I knew something was off. So when The Inkey List’s new <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fadvanced-retinol-us-P520381%3F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Advanced 0.2% Retinal</a> landed on my desk, promising a fast yet gentle experience for retinoid users, I knew I had to give it a try. </p>



<h2>What is The Inkey List’s Advanced 0.2% Retinal, and what are the benefits? </h2>



<p>Without getting all lab-coat on you (and before I get into the nitty gritty), it helps to know the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">difference between retin<em>al</em> </a>— the star ingredient in The Inkey List’s new serum — and retin<em>ol</em>. Both are members of the retinoid family, but they work a little differently.  </p>



<p>Esthetician <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/alicia.lartey/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Alicia Lartey</a> previously explained to R29 that when retinol is applied to the skin, it <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">goes through several steps</a> before being converted into retinoic acid, which triggers all the amazing skin benefits, like improving texture and tone, minimizing fine lines by boosting collagen production, and reducing breakouts by renewing skin cells. Retinal, on the other hand, requires fewer steps to become retinoic acid, so it works faster — 11 times faster, according to The Inkey List. It’s the retinal that gives this serum its striking yellow color, but don’t worry — it hasn’t gone bad, and though it’s a little reminiscent of a turmeric face mask, it absorbs instantly and won’t stain your skin. I can vouch for that.  </p>

<h2>What makes The Inkey List’s Advanced 0.2 Retinal special? </h2>



<p>Even better, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP520381"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Inkey List’s retinal</a> is encapsulated, meaning it’s wrapped in tiny moisturizing molecules that release it gradually into the skin. This way, you get all the benefits of a high-powered ingredient with far less irritation — no soreness or painfully dry, flaky patches here.  </p>



<p>Just when I thought this product couldn’t get any smarter, it also features 1% symsitive, a soothing ingredient that supports the skin barrier (the outer layer that keeps moisture in and bacteria out). This is a relief, as retinoids can easily damage the skin barrier if used incorrectly or too often. Plus, there’s 2% sirtalice, an algae-derived ingredient that helps firm the skin in minutes, making it appear juicy and plump.  </p>

<h3>What to know about The Inkey List’s 0.2% Advanced Retinal serum</h3>



<p>— Features 0.2% encapsulated retinal, a high-strength ingredient that works faster than retinol with minimal irritation. </p>



<p>— Targets dark spots, rough skin texture, fine lines, and breakouts. </p>



<p>— Designed for evening use: two to three times a week at first. </p>

<h2>How do you use The Inkey List’s Advanced 0.2 Retinal, and is it worth it?  </h2>



<p>I’ve been using <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP520381"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Advanced 0.2% Retinal</a> for a few weeks now (a pea-sized amount three nights a week, right after cleansing and before a simple moisturizer), and my skin is already much happier. It’s clearer, bouncier, smoother in texture, and more even in tone, thanks to the retinal helping minimize the red marks left behind by breakouts. Here, I’m wearing a light touch of concealer and blush, and can comfortably skip foundation.</p>



<p>With my skin feeling less dry, the fine lines under my eyes and across my forehead have eased up, too. I even bring it down my neck to help zap the occasional hormonal zit. My neck is the first place to feel sensitive when I use retinoids because the skin is thinner here, but so far, I’ve not experienced any irritation. </p>



<p>It’s a lightweight serum, so you’ll want to make sure the moisturizer you apply on top in the evening is fairly simple and doesn’t contain high-strength actives like exfoliating acids. Good options include <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fsos-daily-skin-barrier-redness-recovery-moisturizer-P506470"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tower 28 SOS Daily Skin Barrier Redness Recovery Moisturizer</a> or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fthe-ordinary-deciem-natural-moisturizing-factors-ha-P427414"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + Hyaluronic Acid</a>. I’m also a fan of <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fthe-inkey-list-bio-active-ceramide-repairing-plumping-moisturizer-P509315"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Inkey List’s Bio-Active Ceramide Repairing and Plumping Moisturizer</a>. </p>





<p>My top tip for anyone using this serum is to continue using a high-factor, broad-spectrum sunscreen in the daytime because retinoids make skin more sensitive to sunlight. Yep, even in the fall and winter months. </p>



<p>You can always count on The Inkey List not to leave anyone out, and there’s good news for retinoid beginners, too. Alongside its buzzy new retinal, the brand has also unveiled a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fstarter-retinol-us-P520372"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Starter Retinol Serum</a>, just as affordable at $14. With 1% granactive retinoid (a gentler, also encapsulated form) and 0.01% retinal, it’s kinder on sensitive skin — even for those with rosacea — thanks to additional soothing ingredients like glycerin and symrelief 100 (made from chamomile and ginger root). While it’s pretty new, the five-star reviews speak for themselves. </p>

<p>Hair artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tomsmithhd/?hl=en"">Tom Smith</a> describes the varsity bob as a choppy, chin-skimming cut with subtle layers and a center part. The inspo? <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stxph.h/?hl=en"">Steph Hui</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/milliebobbybrown/?hl=en"">Millie Bobby Brown</a>. “Polished but never prissy, it carries a cool collegiate energy — youthful without being childish and preppy without being stiff,” says Smith. While the movement might look undone, it’s actually intentional and well-maintained, adds Smith, thanks to the invisible layers through the mid-lengths and ends that create that flicky volume.</p>

<p>“Gucci bangs feel very fashion-forward — and powerful,” says celebrity hairstylist and colorist, Dimitris Giannetos. He recalls creating the softly-parted, slightly grown-out look for <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPCbqhRCcFf/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Demi Moore</a> ahead of her role as the fictional character Barbara Gucci in the short film <a href=""https://www.gucci.com/uk/en_gb/ms/short-film/video/?srsltid=AfmBOoqmlK5X6LGynFA07QzQ_cV-MEN9asH5aMoAgw1q-0w5QmEfs8ve""><em>The Tiger</em></a><em>.</em> “To achieve this look, ask for wispy curtain bangs just below the brows with face-framing pieces towards the ears,” recommends Giannetos. The key? “Avoid a blunt cut by adding some variety to the length of the bangs across the face,” he says.</p>

The ripped bob, however, is a more interesting, layered take, thanks to softly separated ends created with a texturizing technique where the hair is chopped into vertically. This cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DFiwwTohOJ6/?hl=en"">Catherine Gibbs</a> is perfect.</p>

<p>The shag is set to take on a much gentler image in 2026, according to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/neale.rodger/?hl=en"">Neale Rodger</a>, style director at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stil.salon/reels/?hl=en"">STIL salon</a> in London. “Think soft, feathered layers that build volume and create easy movement,” says Rodger, like this look by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DQ8UfaOEZwa/?hl=en"">Ryenne Snow</a>. Rodger adds that it’s the kind of cut that still looks intentional even as it grows out. “It’s a brilliant choice for medium to thick hair,” continues Rodger, “especially if there’s already some natural wave or texture to play with.” Guiding your stylist is simple: “Ask for feathered layers throughout, soft ends, and a length that sits somewhere between the neck and shoulders,” advises Rodger.</p>

<p>The ’70s have had their time in the sun. Now, it’s 1960’s time to shine, and bangs are leading the resurgence, says <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/rickyandthe64/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ricky Walters</a>, founder and creative director of <a href=""https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/kDPwCAD7OkS1gz3BSGfnFGBjS0?domain=instagram.com"">Salon 64</a>. “The new incarnation is all about boldness: think thick, heavy, statement-making fringes taken surprisingly far back into the crown,” says Walters. He adds, “This isn’t a whisper of a fringe; it’s a full-volume curtain that instantly reshapes the face, adding drama, mystery, and a touch of French-girl rebellion.” Walters says that cutting it with plenty of density — adding bulk through techniques like point cutting and texturizing — prevents it from slipping into anything too dated.

<p>The power pixie has <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DKC7SdkIV8j/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Florence Pugh</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/glennclose/?hl=en"">Glenn Close</a>, and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lirisaw/?hl=en"">Iris Law</a> to thank for its meteoric rise. “This is a cropped, layered pixie that’s sharp, sculpted, and deliberately androgynous,” says Smith. Its key characteristics? “Enough length and the top and front to allow for versatile styling,” adds Smith, who calls it the ultimate anti-blowout style. “This is great for finer hair types and those who want more lift, as it helps to contour the jawline and cheekbones when long enough to be tucked behind the ears,” says Smith. Asking for it couldn’t be simpler: “Ask for close layering and texture that can shift from matte and punkish by day to polished and glossy at night,” advises Smith — and don’t forget the longer, swooping bangs.</p>

<p>The name sounds complicated, but the result speaks for itself. It’s essentially a soft blowout with rounded, bouncy ends, explains Giannetos, who recently debuted the look on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPfNBxrAm_i/?img_index=1"">Amal Clooney</a>. “It works well on long, layered hair, about 6-8 inches from the shoulder. This look enhances body, adds movement, and makes the blowout feel thicker and more voluminous,” says Giannetos. “I like to take a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbioionic.com%2Fproducts%2Flong-barrel-curling-iron%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOop4ikEqvaTUTaxG4jDAYCjJnatn52afqSSXogJ4hCj1l_BzoThO"">1.25” Bio Ionic Curler</a> to the ends to lock in the rounded shape.”</p>

<p>The shaggy bob is not only effortlessly chic, says Dublin, but it’s practical for winter and spring. “The layers add movement and texture — great under scarves or hats — while still looking polished for work or evening plans,” adds Dublin. Grab a hydrating hair cream like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fpalo-santo-styling-cream-for-curly-coily-hair-P514454"">PATTERN by Tracee Ellis Ross Palo Santo Styling Cream</a> and let your natural texture do its thing.

<p>Mussed-up texture is in this season, says Stenson, and while the classic shag’s layering technique is making a comeback, it’s being reimagined for 2026 with modern softness and volume. “Even better, it’s flexible across hair types,” he adds. “A shag is great for anyone with thick hair because it removes weight and bulk. If you have finer hair, ask for a modern micro-shag or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/07/10604094/wolf-cut-hair-style"">wolf-shag</a> with strategic layering that adds volume and texture without making the hair look sparse,” advises Stenson.

<p>“The textured lob [aka long bob] will continue its quiet takeover,” says Rodger. “It’s mid-length, slightly undone, and effortlessly cool — the kind of cut that behaves beautifully through winter,” he adds. It’s also a seasonal all-rounder, and easy to air-dry in the warmer months, too. “I love how it slips under scarves and coats without losing shape, and it gives hair that natural, lived-in movement,” continues Rodger, who says it’s perfect for wavy and lightly curly hair. “Ask your stylist for a neck-to-shoulder graze with feathered, textured ends, and a soft, natural finish,” suggests Rodger.

<p>The 2026 update is lighter than its previous counterpart, says Walters, and it sits in what he refers to as the magic zone: “Just above the collarbone and never shorter than the jawline,” adds Walters, like this cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DL7RI9nTj3h/?img_index=1"">Miho Mai</a>. “This sweet spot creates a clean, graphic silhouette without sacrificing softness.” What gives it a modern edge is the invisible layering: “These are subtle, sliced-in shorter pieces hidden underneath,” says Walters. “These secret layers act like built-in movement, allowing the bob to swing, breathe, and catch the light in all the right ways.”</p>

<p>If they’re not cut properly, curtain bangs can look blocky and unnatural, failing to blend into the rest of your lengths. That’s why Stenson suggests asking for “texturized” curtain bangs. Texturized bangs are cut with techniques that soften the fringe and remove bulk, so they fall more naturally. “Your stylist will assess the density of your hair to ensure your bangs are proportionate to your face,” says Stenson. “Bangs are especially a great choice for those with fine or thin hair and looking to bring some volume to their look. They’re truly versatile enough to suit all face shapes.” Take inspiration from this cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DHXGOA8RxGH/?hl=en"">@charlottexstyles</a> on Instagram.</p>

<p>The bixie — bob meets pixie — is heading into 2026 with us, and for good reason: it’s soft, wearable, and short enough to feel fresh, says Rodger. “This is a sweet spot between a bob and a pixie, and it’s ideal for anyone tempted to go shorter without committing to a full pixie,” says Rodger. He adds that it works especially well on fine to medium hair, which always benefits from added texture through the mid-lengths and ends. “When you’re asking for it in the chair, think chin length or slightly above, with light, choppy layers and a soft, airy finish.” We love this crop by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DKmqHaSxsQ2/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Chellsie Aiger Serrano</a>.</p>

<p>Rodger is convinced that a “clean, blunt bob” is the answer to feeling polished without the effort, like this cut on STIL client <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DJcGcLqIu_E/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Abbie de Fontaine</a>. “The strong, even line gives you instant structure,” he says. “Plus, it looks incredible peeking out from under winter and spring layers.” He adds that the cut is particularly beautiful on slightly wavy or straight, finer hair, as it lends weight and sharpness. For the best result, Rodger suggests asking for a chin-to-collarbone bob with crisp, blunt ends and minimal layering. “Keep it sleek or lightly textured depending on your hair type,” he says.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951226.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>R29 babes, as January continues to unfold, we’re actually being gifted something rare: a full breathing period. Since the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, this week arrives without major planetary transits, creating space to <em>integrate</em> rather than react. While we may still feel the emotional residue of that Full Moon for the first few days, the intensity begins to soften, allowing us to land more fully in the present moment. A lot has been released: old fears, lingering heartbreaks, repetitive worries, longings we’ve outgrown, and now we’re being asked to root ourselves in what’s here now. With the sun, Mercury, Venus, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars all in Capricorn</a>, the cosmos is firmly Earth-coded, encouraging steadiness, embodiment, and follow-through.</p>



<p>That said, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">a heavy Capricorn</a> emphasis comes with its own shadow. This much discipline and structure can make some signs take life, or themselves, a little too seriously. The good news is that the moon begins the week in Leo (January 4th–early January 6th), injecting warmth, confidence, and creative flair into an otherwise focused landscape. There’s a desire to be seen, to express, to play a little, even while handling responsibilities. Then, from January 6th through January 8th, the moon moves through Virgo, harmonizing beautifully with the Capricorn stellium. This is prime time for intentional action, organization, and tending to the details that actually move the needle. The gift here is falling in love with the process: doing the “mundane” things with care and purpose. The caution? Don’t let perfectionism keep you stuck in editing mode. Progress matters more than polish. </p>



<p>As the week winds down, the moon enters Libra, shifting the energy toward connection, beauty, and harmony. After days of self-focus and productivity, we’re reminded that life isn’t just about getting things done — it’s about sharing experiences, creating art, and nurturing relationships. This is a lovely way to close out a post–Full Moon week: lighter, more relational, more heart-centered. Enjoy the structure <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Capricorn season offers</a>, but leave room for pleasure and play. Discipline works best when it’s balanced with joy.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, this week feels like a rare moment where no one is yelling “pivot” at you from the universe. This week you get to <em>settle into</em> the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">heavy Capricorn energy</a> that’s been building in your career, reputation, and legacy sector. Think less chaos, more quiet confidence. You may notice yourself caring less about instant gratification and more about long-term impact: updating your résumé, refining a pitch, cleaning up your LinkedIn, or simply asking, <em>“Is this the version of me I want people to remember?”</em> The vibe is mature, focused, and surprisingly calming. The advice here: don’t rush to make dramatic moves. This is a week for consistency, follow-through, and showing yourself that you can trust your own discipline.</p>



<p>The mood shifts subtly as the week unfolds. The Leo Moon (Jan 4th–early Jan 6th) lights up your creativity and pleasure zone, making it easier to enjoy what you’re working toward — this could look like rewarding yourself after a productive day or flirting with a passion project just for fun. Midweek, the Virgo Moon (Jan 6th–8th) brings you back to earth, activating your work and wellness sector. Suddenly you’re deep-cleaning, organizing your calendar, or finally doing the thing you’ve been procrastinating (yes, <em>that</em> email). The key is not nitpicking yourself into paralysis… done is better than perfect.</p>



<p>By the weekend, the Libra Moon activates your relationship sector, shifting the focus to connection. Plans feel sweeter, conversations flow more easily, and you’re reminded that success hits harder when it’s shared. The move this week? Build the future <em>and</em> enjoy the process. Both can coexist.</p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, this week feels like a long exhale. You’re able to settle into the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Capricorn-dominant energy</a> activating your growth, learning, and long-term vision sector. Instead of feeling rushed, you’re moving with intention: reading, researching, planning, or quietly reorienting your life toward something that feels more meaningful. This could look like committing to a course, mapping out a future trip, or revisiting a belief you’ve outgrown. The vibe isn’t loud; it’s steady. The advice here is simple: trust the slow build. You don’t need immediate proof that you’re on the right path — clarity comes from staying present and curious.</p>



<p>The emotional tone shifts as the moon changes signs throughout the week. The Leo Moon (Jan 4th–early Jan 6th) activates your home and comfort zone, making you crave coziness: cooking something indulgent, staying in, or reconnecting with family. Midweek, the Virgo Moon (Jan 6th–8th) lights up your creativity and romance sector, putting you in the mood to make something beautiful or enjoy someone’s company without overthinking it. This is great energy for dating, art, or pleasure, as long as you don’t turn fun into a performance review.</p>



<p>By the weekend, the Libra Moon shifts focus to your routines and well-being. You may feel motivated to reset your schedule, move your body, or make your daily life feel more balanced. The takeaway: this week rewards you for honoring both comfort <em>and</em> growth… no extremes required.</p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, this week feels like mental relief you didn’t realize you were craving. This week you get to settle into the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Capricorn-heavy energy</a> activating your intimacy, shared resources, and emotional depth sector. Translation: fewer distractions, more clarity. You might find yourself calmly sorting out finances, having grown-up conversations about boundaries, or finally sitting with feelings you usually talk your way around. It’s not dramatic… it’s steady. The vibe is “I can handle this,” not “I need to figure everything out right now.” The advice here is to lean into depth without spiraling. You don’t have to solve every emotional mystery this week — just be honest with yourself.</p>



<p>As the moon shifts signs, your focus follows. The Leo Moon (Jan 4th–early Jan 6th) activates your communication zone, making you extra expressive — texts are flowing, ideas are popping, and conversations feel energizing. Midweek, the Virgo Moon (Jan 6th–8th) rounds you back into home and emotional basics. You might clean, reorganize, or suddenly care a lot about your environment feeling calm and functional. Try not to nitpick yourself or others… peace beats perfection.</p>



<p>By the weekend, the Libra Moon lights up your creativity and romance sector, reminding you that connection and pleasure matter too. Plans feel lighter, flirting feels easier, and joy doesn’t need a thesis statement. This week’s win? Balancing depth with delight — and realizing you’re actually really good at that.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, this week brings a much-needed sense of emotional steadiness. You’re able to settle into the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Capricorn-heavy energy</a> activating your partnership and commitment sector. Things feel less raw than they did around the Full Moon, and more… workable. You may notice yourself thinking clearly about relationships — romantic, professional, or personal — without getting swept away by emotion. This could look like calmly renegotiating expectations, recognizing who’s consistent versus who’s just loud, or realizing you don’t need to fix everything to feel secure. The advice here is to let stability be enough. Not every relationship needs a breakthrough moment; some just need consistency.</p>



<p>As the moon moves through the week, your emotional focus shifts gently. The Leo Moon (Jan 4th–early Jan 6th) highlights money and self-worth, making you more aware of what feels valuable — this could be budgeting, charging your worth, or simply treating yourself without guilt. Midweek, the Virgo Moon (Jan 6th–8th) activates your communication sector, making it a great time for honest conversations, journaling, or clearing the air in a low-drama way. Just watch the tendency to over-explain; simple truths land best.</p>



<p>By the weekend, the Libra Moon draws your attention home, encouraging rest, comfort, and emotional balance. The vibe is soft, relational, and grounding. This week reminds you that peace isn’t boring… it’s healing.</p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, this week feels like getting your footing back without needing applause. You’re able to settle into the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Capricorn-heavy energy</a> activating your work, routines, and wellness sector. Translation: things feel manageable again. You may find satisfaction in showing up consistently: getting through your to-do list, improving a habit, or finally creating a schedule that doesn’t exhaust you. This isn’t flashy progress, but it’s real. The advice here is to stop waiting for motivation and let momentum do the work. Small, repeatable actions are quietly rebuilding your confidence.</p>



<p>The emotional rhythm of the week shifts with the moon. The Leo Moon (Jan 4th–early Jan 6th) puts <em>you</em> back in your body; confidence returns, energy lifts, and you remember why you’re the main character. Midweek, the Virgo Moon (Jan 6th–8th) asks you to get practical about money and self-worth: budgeting, organizing, or finally charging what you’re worth. Don’t spiral into self-critique… precision beats perfection.</p>



<p>By the weekend, the Libra Moon lights up your communication and social zone, making plans feel easy and conversations flow. Say yes to connection, keep it light, and remember: balance is the flex this week.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, this week feels like a reward for all the emotional labor you’ve already done. You’re able to sink into the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Capricorn-heavy energy</a> activating your creativity, pleasure, and self-expression sector. This is a surprisingly sweet spot for you. Instead of overanalyzing what comes next, you’re more present with what’s already working, whether that’s a creative project, a romantic connection, or simply a sense of joy you don’t feel the need to justify. The advice here is to let yourself enjoy things without immediately turning them into an improvement plan. You don’t need to optimize happiness. You’re allowed to experience it.</p>



<p>The week’s emotional flow mirrors that grounded ease. The Leo Moon (Jan 4th–early Jan 6th) lights up your rest and inner world, making it a great time to recharge, reflect, or move a little slower without guilt. Midweek, the Virgo Moon (Jan 6th–8th) lands in your sign, putting you back in your body and your power. You may feel more focused, capable, and motivated to handle practical matters… just don’t let perfectionism hijack the moment. Progress to perfect.</p>



<p>By the weekend, the Libra Moon shifts attention to your money and values sector, encouraging balance around spending, earning, and self-worth. This week’s win is simple but big: you’re learning how to be productive <em>and</em> fulfilled at the same time.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, this week feels like emotional breathing room you didn’t know you needed. With no major transits shaking the table, you get to settle into the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Capricorn-heavy energy</a> activating your home, family, and inner foundation sector. Life slows down in a good way. You may find yourself nesting, reorganizing your space, or craving quiet moments that help you feel grounded again. This isn’t about isolation — it’s about recalibrating your nervous system. The advice here is to stop overcommitting out of politeness. You don’t owe everyone access to you right now. Stability is the vibe, and you’re allowed to choose it.</p>



<p>The week unfolds gently as the moon moves signs. The Leo Moon (Jan 4th–early Jan 6th) brings social energy and reminds you that friendship can feel nourishing when it’s low-pressure — think casual hangs, group chats, or creative collaboration. Midweek, the Virgo Moon (Jan 6th–8th) nudges you inward, activating your rest and reflection zone. You may feel more introspective or tired than usual; honor that instead of fighting it.</p>



<p>By the weekend, the Libra Moon lands in your sign, and suddenly you’re back in your element: balanced, magnetic, and ready to connect. Plans feel sweeter, conversations flow, and you remember why harmony is your superpower. The win this week? Letting rest fuel your glow up.</p>

Your mind feels organized, strategic, and less reactive than usual. This is a great week for planning, writing, negotiating, or finally saying what you’ve been holding back, without turning it into a whole thing. You may notice yourself choosing precision over intensity, which honestly works in your favor right now. The advice here is to trust the calm. You don’t need to force breakthroughs; steady progress is doing the work for you.</p>



<p>As the moon shifts, your focus follows in a very natural rhythm. The Leo Moon (Jan 4th–early Jan 6th) highlights your career and visibility, making it easier to be seen, take up space, or handle professional matters with confidence. Midweek, the Virgo Moon (Jan 6th–8th) activates your friendships and long-term goals, nudging you to reconnect with people who actually get you, or to refine a vision you’re building toward. Don’t over-edit yourself here; collaboration doesn’t require perfection.</p>



<p>By the weekend, the Libra Moon draws you inward, encouraging rest, reflection, and emotional detox. This week’s magic lies in balance: speak clearly, act intentionally, and give yourself quiet time to recharge.</p>

You don’t need to leap ahead… consistency is quietly working in your favor.</p>



<p>The emotional tone shifts as the moon moves through the sky. The Leo Moon (Jan 4th–early Jan 6th) activates your big-picture, adventure-loving side, making you crave inspiration: reading something stimulating, planning a future trip, or having conversations that expand your perspective. Midweek, the Virgo Moon (Jan 6th–8th) brings you back to reality, spotlighting career responsibilities and asking you to show up professionally and thoughtfully.

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, this week feels like home turf.

This is the kind of week where progress looks like showing up consistently, honoring your boundaries, and trusting that you don’t need to prove anything right now. The advice here is to resist the urge to over-manage everything. You don’t need to control the outcome when you’re already aligned with the process.</p>



<p>As the moon moves through the week, your focus softens and expands. The Leo Moon (Jan 4th–early Jan 6th) activates your intimacy and shared-resources sector, bringing emotional depth — this could look like a real conversation, a money check-in, or letting someone support you instead of doing it all yourself. Midweek, the Virgo Moon (Jan 6th–8th) harmonizes beautifully with your sign, lighting up your growth and perspective sector. This is prime energy for planning, learning, or reconnecting with a long-term vision that excites you.</p>



<p>By the weekend, the Libra Moon shifts attention to your career and visibility, making it a great time to step out, be seen, or share your work—without forcing it. The win this week? Leading by example, not exhaustion.</p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, this week feels like intentional invisibility… and that’s a good thing. Now that the Cancer full moon is waning, you’re able to sink into the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Capricorn-heavy energy</a> activating your rest, subconscious, and behind-the-scenes sector. This is not a week for loud moves or announcements. It’s a week for tying loose ends, clearing mental clutter, and letting yourself decompress after an emotionally full start to the year. You might be journaling more, sleeping deeper, or realizing what you’re simply no longer available for. The advice here is to stop judging this phase as “unproductive.” Rest is strategic right now. You’re conserving energy for what’s coming next.</p>



<p>As the Moon shifts, so does your internal focus. The Leo Moon (Jan 4th–early Jan 6th) highlights your relationship sector, bringing moments of connection or reflection around how you show up with others: this could be a heart-to-heart or just noticing who feels easy to be around. Midweek, the Virgo Moon (Jan 6th–8th) draws attention to emotional depth, shared resources, and energetic boundaries. You may want to organize finances, release emotional baggage, or have an honest internal check-in. Don’t overanalyze… just observe.</p>



<p>By the weekend, the Libra Moon lifts your gaze outward, activating your big-picture and inspiration zone. You’re reminded that this quiet week has purpose: it’s clearing space so you can re-enter the world refreshed, aligned, and ready to be seen again.</p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, this week feels like a soft reset that actually sticks. With no major transits stirring emotional waves, you’re able to settle into the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Capricorn-heavy energy</a> activating your friendships, community, and long-term goals sector. This is about the future you’re building, and who’s building it <em>with</em> you. You may feel drawn to reconnect with people who feel solid, dependable, and aligned, while naturally drifting away from dynamics that thrive on confusion or emotional labor. The advice here is to trust your discernment. Wanting reliability doesn’t make you boring; it means you’re serious about creating a life that supports you.</p>



<p>The emotional rhythm of the week flows gently as the moon changes signs. The Leo Moon (Jan 4th–early Jan 6th) brings attention to your daily routines and well-being, reminding you that how you treat your body and time matters more than grand gestures. Midweek, the Virgo Moon (Jan 6th–8th) lights up your partnership sector, making it a good moment for honest, grounded conversations — romantic or professional — about expectations and balance. Keep it simple; clarity is kindness.</p>



<p>By the weekend, the Libra Moon draws you inward, activating emotional intimacy and healing. You may crave deeper connection or quiet reflection rather than surface-level plans. This week’s gift is subtle but powerful: you’re learning that stability and sensitivity don’t cancel each other out… they work best together.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951984.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>This is a clear picture of the moon taken with a long zoom lens with the milky way in the background</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The supermoon kicks off 2026 on the right foot for us all! Mark your calendars: January 3rd brings the Super Full Wolf Moon in the sign of Cancer. As the first Full Moon of the new year, this is a magnificent time to make a list of what no longer serves us, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/how-to-protect-your-peace"">protecting our peace</a> and what we want to attain in 2026. It is essential to focus on what genuinely will propel us forward and fill us up on a spiritual level. 2025 was draining and exhausting in many ways, which is why this lunation is an excellent time for us to embark <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/new-job-hunt-motivational-career-tips"">on a new journey</a> and bring in positivity, rather than dwelling.  </p>



<p>This supermoon is closer to earth than previous ones, allowing us to feel the lunar frequency more intensely. As you may recall, a supermoon happens when the earth is positioned in perigee to the moon. The proximity allows us to experience the Full Moon in an in-depth manner, as it appears to be brighter and more illuminating than other lunations.  </p>



<p>The moon thrives when it’s in the sign Cancer. Since the Full Moon is dignified and urging us to center our hearts on intimate areas, it serves as a reminder to focus on our homes, families, relationships, friendships, and ourselves. We are figuring out who and what we are giving our emotional labor to. Are we willing to get out of our comfort zones and begin a new era? If so, what does that <em>look</em> like for our futures? More importantly, what does that <em>feel</em> like in the present situations?  </p>



<p>Let’s break down the astrology of the supermoon. Affectionate Venus and temperamental <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars in Capricorn</a> oppose the moon, escalating our moodiness and sentiments. Our patience is going to be tested because Mars has no chill and tends to thrust us toward impulsivity. Venus creates a push-and-pull dynamic with the moon, heightening tension around our insecurities and instincts. We are reacting to what we are acquiring from others. Keep in mind, we get what we give. So, be sure to create an environment that works best for you. The days of putting the needs of others are behind us; we are looking to uplift our auras. The most significant and meaningful relationship is the one we have with ourselves. Therefore, we should give ourselves grace and compassion as we head to a place of safety and security on all levels.  </p>



<p>The karmic Nodes of Destiny on the Pisces and Virgo axis offer us compelling choices for change. We will be torn between two different (or possibly more) directions, asking us whether we want to repeat the same old situations or move into the new ones. Consider the obligations you’ve carried and the version of yourself you’re releasing. If you aren’t ready or fearful to walk into the unknown, then perhaps you should take cautionary steps. The decision is yours, but a fresh start is possible. Listen to your heart and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-intuition-gut-instinct-personal-safety"">lead with your intuition</a>.  </p>



<p>The sun and Venus are coming together to form a conjunction in Capricorn on January 6th. Known as Venus Star Point, a term coined by astrologer Arielle Guttman, this marks a pivotal moment for relationships, self-confidence, and trendsetting. Furthermore, the Venus Star Point reflects the social climate we’re experiencing and sets the vibe for 2026. Take a look at what was happening four years before and before that, then another four years, and so on, to see the themes that will arise at this time. The next day, Venus and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars align in Capricorn</a>, heightening the energy of the Full Moon and Venus Star Point, pushing us to take additional action on the intentions set on January 3rd. </p>



<p>The Quadrantid (located near the Big Dipper) meteor shower coincides with this lunation. The magical, yet short-lived and intense celestial spark occurs every year at the beginning of January. The “fireballs” brightly light up the sky in rapid motion, offering us a beautiful landscape to gaze upon. We’ll literally wish upon a star and enchant our lives with greatness. This is another reminder from the universe to stay present and acknowledge the beauty that surrounds us as well as within our spirit. </p>

<p><em>Welcome to “</em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/author/kathleen-newman-bremang""><em>What’s Good</em></a><em>,” a column where we break down what’s soothing, distracting, or just plain good in Hollywood with a “rooting for everybody Black” energy. These are the best onscreen performances of 2025 by Black performers. </em></p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952582.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>The headline of my end-of-year column hasn’t changed since I started compiling the best of the best in film a few years ago. <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2025-in-review/the-best-performances-of-2025"">The Best Performances of 2025</a> are Black, just like they <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/12/11830656/best-black-movie-performances-2024"">were in 2024</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/12/11625372/best-black-movie-performances-2023"">2023</a>, and so on. Black performers consistently raise the bar. They are great because they <em>have</em> to be, and especially in a year when we saw <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/03/11844306/hollywood-dei-rollbacks-black-actors-cast-reboots-racism"">Hollywood roll back DEI commitments</a> and descend into a hellscape where Black actors had to defend themselves from being called “DEI hires” for simply working while Black, these performances cut through the noise and let the work speak for itself. </p>



<p>In 2025, there were so many Black performers who met the challenge of being excellent in the face of an industry that is actively trying to erase them. They took the gravity (or levity) of their material and elevated what was on the page to make it even better. In a year that tested us all — seriously, we barely survived — through their work these artists gave us so much, a reprieve from the hellscape of our social feeds and portrayals of the human experience that revealed a little more about ourselves. Every <a href=""https://variety.com/lists/2025-oscars-predictions/"">awards season</a>, I remind you that while <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2021/09/10683126/emmys-2021-shutout-michaela-coel-divest"">we’ve long since divested</a> from the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/04/10444066/oscar-snubs-racism-2021"">gatekeeping archaic institutions</a> that consistently exclude Black folks from legacy awards, giving recognition where it’s due still matters. </p>



<p>When <em>Sinners</em> was undoubtedly (when it came to box office performance <em>and</em> cultural impact) the movie of the year, and yet still is left off of multiple (white) critics’ year-end lists and awards predictions, it’s more and more evident that we need to uplift our own (let’s not forget that winning an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/02/11306030/naacp-image-awards-2023-winners-moments"">NAACP Image Award</a> should be just as big of an honor as getting an Oscar). We must acknowledge the best Black performances beyond the one or two actors that legacy awards deem worthy of being their annual token, albeit deserved, inclusions. We refuse to settle for crumbs. We get to exist in a timeline where a multitude of Black artistic expressions are celebrated. ‘Tis the season to look back on the best of the best of the year and the best, as always, is Black as hell — whether they get accolades from certain governing bodies or not.</p>



<p>These are the performances I’ve been yelling at you about all year. So, here is my exhaustive, definitive, and still not long enough list of 2025’s best Black film performances. <br /></p>



<h2>Michael B. Jordan, <em>Sinners</em> </h2>







<p>Five years ago, I wrote a piece called “<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/01/9192700/michael-b-jordan-oscar-snubs-just-mercy"">Shouldn’t Michael B. Jordan Have An Oscar Nomination By Now?</a>.” In it, I argued that Jordan was long overdue for a nomination for an Academy Award. In 2020, the MBJ role in contention was his performance as real-life <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/12/9070851/where-is-michael-b-jordan-just-mercy-character-now"">social justice lawyer Bryan Stevenson</a> in <em>Just Mercy</em>. Despite being one of the most famous, talented, bankable heartthrobs in Hollywood, he hasn’t garnered the same accolades his contemporaries of past generations had at his age (see DiCaprio, Damon, Cruise, Pitt). It may be five years late, but Jordan is finally in contention for a Best Actor nod for his portrayal of Smoke and Stack, the prodigal twins of <em>Sinners</em>. I bring up Jordan’s awards chances not because I think a nomination or win would impact the quality of his work, but because after these performances, he deserves every accolade available to him in this industry. As Smoke and Stack, Jordan shows off range many of his detractors will swear he doesn’t have. In each scene, with a tilt of his head or the looseness of his swagger, Jordan carves out each twin’s mannerisms uniquely enough that you are rooting for Smoke while holding your breath waiting for Stack to mess things up, and subtly enough that it’s clear the brothers are inseparable and to an untrained eye, sometimes indecipherable. </p>



<p>It takes a lot of skill to carry an ambitious masterpiece like <em>Sinners</em>. And to put it simply, the film does not work without the precision and thoughtfulness of Jordan’s performances. We’ve been watching him grow as an actor since he was coming of age in<em> All My Children, The Wire, </em>and <em>Friday Night Lights</em>, to young powerhouse showings in <em>Fruitvale Station</em> and <em>Creed</em>. Then, there were the bonafide blockbusters in <em>Creed II</em> and <em>Black Panther. </em>Jordan has proven — repeatedly –  that he’s earned his status as a Movie Star. <em>Sinners</em> is proof he’s done something so many of his peers only dream of: reached his potential and surpassed it. </p>



<h2>Cynthia Erivo, <em>Wicked: For Good </em></h2>







<p>Yes, I am one of the few critics who actually liked <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/11/11944213/wicked-for-good-review-elphaba-glinda-love-story"">Wicked: For Good</a>.</em> I stand by my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/11/11944213/wicked-for-good-review-elphaba-glinda-love-story"">review of the film</a>, which argued that while the movie is the weaker half in the two-part adaptation of the Broadway musical, it did right by its source material and delivered a thrilling, emotional, and endearing conclusion. And about Erivo, who is undoubtedly the best Elphaba of all time, I wrote, “many headlines about Wicked: For Good have <a href=""https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/wicked-for-good-review-give-ariana-grande-the-oscar-now/"">focused on Ariana Grande</a>, and while it’s true she is great in this sequel and that it’s more Glinda’s movie than Elphaba’s, Erivo is still firing on all cylinders, delivering a timeless performance that is also worthy of unadulterated praise. Throughout <em>Wicked: For Good</em>, Elphaba goes from fugitive freedom fighter, to heartbroken friend and exasperated sister, to frustrated revolutionary, to lover in mourning, to resigned martyr. It’s a depressing arc that sees the optimism of progressivism dashed with a big dose of witch-melting water. The simplicity of the message — that doing good comes at a cost, that no matter your intentions, things don’t always work in your favor, and that facism may take on a new face but it’s an ever-present threat — is the point.” </p>



<p>The <em>Wicked</em> instalments are going to go down in history as two of the biggest movies of this decade, if not the century, and that will largely be because Cynthia Erivo gave us an unforgettable and undeniable Elphaba. </p>



<h2>Tessa Thompson, <em>Hedda</em> </h2>



<p>Not to keep quoting myself but this is what I wrote about <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/10/11939097/hedda-movie-review-tessa-thompson-interview""><em>Hedda</em> in my review</a> back in October: “Set in 1950s England, as the party devolves into shambles — mostly orchestrated by Hedda herself — <em>Hedda</em> goes from a simmering conversation about what happens to a woman bound by her circumstances to a sexy psychological thriller about class, power, and ambition. As the events of the evening unfold, Hedda becomes more and more quietly unhinged and Tessa Thompson is so magnetic, oozing with charisma, that you can’t look away and you can’t help but root for one of the messiest women in cinematic history. I like to think of this column as my own Oscars. The Academy is going to deem their own “best of the best” come March 2026, and while Tessa Thompson’s name should definitely be on that ballot, in this space, I get to say what’s the best of the year and I am telling you — unequivocally — that <em>Hedda</em> is one of the best films and performances of the past year. Period.” <br /></p>

<h2>Wunmi Mosaku, <em>Sinners</em> </h2>



<p>As mentioned above, <em>Sinners</em> is Michael B. Jordan’s showcase. But it’s more than just a vehicle for MBJ’s movie stardom or a Southern gothic horror flick like it’s been billed. It is that, but it’s also an enthusiastic musical, a consequential period drama, and an earnest romance. It’s the latter that piqued my interest the most, and its execution is swoon-inducing. I already knew Wunmi Mosaku was a star, but in this role, she’s assertive, luminous and so damn sexy. Annie is the heart of <em>Sinners</em>. She’s also its hero.  “I like to think of Annie as Smoke’s other other half, like Stack is,” <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/04/11881716/sinners-movie-ending-explained-wunmi-mosaku-interview"">Mosaku said when we interviewed her in April</a>. “Stack is one side of him, but Annie is another side of him. She’s his protector, lover, mother, safe place. She is his sanctuary.” Annie’s knowledge of the spiritual world also saves everyone’s — including Smoke’s — asses. “She moves with purpose. She moves with strength and power. She has such an anchored spirit and is so in tune with the other stuff that we can’t see or feel or hear. She sees and feels and hears it.”</p>

<h2>Ayo Edebiri, <em>After The Hunt</em></h2>



<p>I’m ready to be right about <em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8R6DMlDtxk"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">After The Hunt</a></em>. It might take a few years, but I swear this film will outlive its discourse. The Luca Guadagnino-directed drama documents a moment in time — a disturbing, delicate, and awkward moment in time, one that we are still navigating. And for better or worse, shouldn’t we have art that reflects these times? That’s what I wrote at the time of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/10/11937612/after-the-hunt-review-ayo-edebiri-andrew-garfield-interview"">the film’s release</a> and I stand by it: “With time, <em>After The Hunt </em>may hold up as a page to be read in the chapter of this so-called cultural reckoning. Think of it as a sleek and uncomfortable time capsule of the past half decade of #MeToo discourse, or as a character study of flawed intellectuals desperately attempting to perform their values while clinging to the facade of their respective identities. Or, as Ayo Edebiri told me, <em>After The Hunt </em>is a “<a href=""https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-rorschach-inkblot-test-2795806"">Rorschach test</a>” that interrogates your discomfort. </p>



<p>And it’s in that discomfort where Edebiri and the rest of the cast (Andrew Garfield and Julia Roberts are both excellent as usual) shine. If you’ve seen <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/07/11919394/the-bear-sydney-ayo-edebiri-emmy-nominations-comedy"">The Bear</a></em> or <em>Bottoms</em>, you know Edebiri is a star who can play awkward better than anyone. It was this role that reminded me that she’s going to be around for a very long time. Going toe-to-toe with icon Roberts without flinching and sparring effortlessly with Oscar nominee Garfield, Edebiri in <em>After The Hunt</em> is one of those star-making performances that we’ll look back on in awe. </p>

<h2>David Jonsson, <em>The Long Walk</em></h2>







<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/davidjonsson__/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">David Jonsson</a> doesn’t get enough credit for being one of the most exciting and talented working actors of his generation. I officially fell in love with him in <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/rye-lane-review-black-british-romcom"">Rye Lane</a></em>, one of the best rom-coms of the past decade, and this year, he showed versatility and depth in his choices. In <em>The Long Walk</em>, Jonsson anchors the film’s brutal premise: a near-future America where teenage boys volunteer for a televised endurance contest that demands they keep walking above the minimum speed or face lethal consequences. Jonsson’s performance is achingly vulnerable. As the miles stack up and the rules tighten (three warnings, then you’re shot), Jonsson charts the slow erosion of bravado into something far more fragile. </p>



<p>As realization sets in that survival isn’t just about strong legs, it’s about memory, friendship, and the will to keep choosing the next step, Jonsson is especially magnetic in the quieter stretches, trading jokes with fellow walkers (and delivering electric <a href=""https://www.gq.com/story/cooper-hoffman-and-david-jonsson-gq-hype"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">chemistry with Cooper Hoffman</a>) at dawn, bargaining with himself as the road narrows, and letting grief and resolve flicker across his face when the crowd’s cheers turn hollow. Rather than leaning into the spectacle of the contest, Jonsson makes the walk feel personal. With each warning comes a small heartbreak and each mile an excruciating decision. grounding the dystopia in intimacy and reminding us that the most powerful performances don’t outrun the story; they walk straight through it.</p>



<h2>Naomi Ackie, <em>Mickey 17</em></h2>



<p>It’s still baffling to me that Bong Joon Ho’s <em>Mickey 17</em> flopped because it’s so weird and wonderful, and the kind of original movie from one of the greatest living directors that we need more of. But I refuse to let people forget about <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/03/11864663/naomi-ackie-mickey-17-nasha-character-interview"">Naomi Ackie’s performance as Nasha</a>, the love interest to Pattinson’s aloof Mickey. Nasha is wild, extremely weird, and an enforcer in a futuristic universe where civilian space travel to another planet sets it apart from our current reality, but a psychotic tyrannical politician with a god complex (<a href=""https://screenrant.com/mickey-17-villain-donald-trump-parody/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mark Ruffalo’s Kenneth Marshall</a>) makes it feel eerily familiar. </p>



<p>Here’s what I wrote back in March: “While <em>Mickey 17</em> is, by all accounts, a showcase of Pattinson’s unquantifiable talent, it’s also a stunning display of how reliably formidable <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/naomi-ackie-actress-star-wars"">Naomi Ackie</a> is. She’s one of the brightest talents working right now, and the weirder she gets, the more wonderful it is to watch. Mickey is clueless, compliant, and a bit dense. Nasha is clever, confident, and fearless. Nasha could easily be relegated to a girlfriend-of-the-hero stereotype, a disposable plot device, but in Bong’s script, she’s assertive, motivated, and layered. And in Ackie’s hands, Nasha leaps off the page and dazzles on screen.”</p>



<h2>Damson Idris,<em> F1</em></h2>



<p>After captivating audiences as <a href=""https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/snowfall/cast/damson-idris-franklin-saint"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Franklin Saint in </a><em><a href=""https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/snowfall/cast/damson-idris-franklin-saint"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Snowfall</a></em>, Damson Idris had cemented himself as a young actor to watch in Hollywood. He shifted gears — literally — into high-octane territory with his leading role in <em><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/26/movies/f1-movie-review-brad-pitt.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">F1</a></em><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/26/movies/f1-movie-review-brad-pitt.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">, the Formula 1 racing film</a> from director Joseph Kosinski and co-starring Brad Pitt. I didn’t love <em>F1</em>, but it was one of the biggest movies of the year and the things that do work about the film are thanks in large part to Idris, who brings charisma and surprising vulnerability to his portrayal of hotshot driver Joshua Pierce. </p>



<p>Whether he’s embodying a South Central kingpin or donning a racing suit opposite Hollywood heavyweights, Idris brings depth, precision, and a quiet confidence that continues to set him apart. And as Unbothered’s very own <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/author/christa-eduafo"">Christa Eduafo</a> found out when she sat down with him <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/06/11910300/damson-idris-f1-movie-interview"">earlier this year in New York City</a>, the actor is well aware that his Black female fanbase bet big on Damson Idris stock early. And with F1, it’s clear our investment has paid off. </p>

<h2>Chase Infiniti, Teyana Taylor &amp; Regina Hall, <em>One Battle After Another </em></h2>



<p>The Black women characters in <em>One Battle After Another </em>have elicited divisive responses. Some critics have written off Teyana Taylor’s Perfidia Beverly Hills as a sexualized stereotype with limited screen time and an underdeveloped character arc. In her <a href=""https://open.substack.com/pub/blackgirlwatching/p/one-battle-after-another-review?r=1mo59&amp;utm_medium=ios"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Black Girl Watching Substack</a>, Brooke Obie writes, “Black women are little more than props and plot devices” and that “[director Paul Thomas] Anderson isn’t commenting on the white male fetishization of Black women, he’s directly participating in it.” While <a href=""https://www.vulture.com/article/black-actresses-are-carrying-one-battle-after-another.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Angelica Jade Bastien for Vulture</a> says, “The Black women of the film are lightning rods for the most forceful conversations the film can bear, and it’s thrilling to watch them embody what Anderson’s script can only loosely hold.” </p>



<p>There’s a lot to say about how Paul Thomas Anderson depicts Perfidia, Chase Infiniti’s Willa, and Regina Hall’s Deandra (I agree mostly with both Obie and Bastien and their reviews are required supplementary reading material post-watch of <em>OBAA</em>), but of all the critiques of the execution of the lofty ideas of revolution that PTA puts forth in the film, nothing negative can be said about the performances given by these three enigmatic actors. Infiniti is the breakout of the film, playing an almost grown up Willa (the daughter of DiCaprio’s Pat and Taylor’s Perfidia) with quiet resolve and appropriate teen angst. It’s one of the most stunning breakout performances I’ve ever seen and Infiniti should have her pick of roles in the aftermath of this movie’s success. </p>



<p>As for Hall and Taylor, we knew how talented they were — though in different mediums: Taylor as an artist, dancer, and creative director and Hall as a comedic genius. In this film, even if I wish the material lived up to their efforts, both are able to showcase their abilities to give grounding, affecting, dramatic performances. Deandra and Perfidia are in conversation with each other, showing two sides of how to be a revolutionary, and Hall and Taylor’s performances are striking. While Perfidia is loud, brash, emotional, reckless, and boisterous, Deandra is methodical, focused, and intentional. <em>One Battle After Another </em>has been hailed as PTA’s greatest masterpiece and don’t get me wrong, I do think the movie is a triumph, but let’s be clear on <em>why</em> it’s great: Chase Infiniti, Teyana Taylor and Regina Hall. </p>

<h2>Edi Gathegi, <em>Superman</em></h2>







<p><em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY-YcYmzgZI"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Superman</a></em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY-YcYmzgZI"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> was</a> one of my favorite movies of the year. And while the main cast trio of David Corenswet, Rachel Brosnahan, and Nicholas Hoult, Edi <a href=""https://variety.com/2025/film/news/superman-edi-gathegi-mister-terrific-credits-scene-x-men-1236460211/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Gathegi’s Mister Terrific</a> was a surprising delight. Mister Terrific emerges as one of <em>Superman</em>’s smartest anchors, threading intellect through a story preoccupied with power, trust, and what the world expects its heroes to be. As the film tracks Clark Kent navigating a public increasingly skeptical of Superman’s unchecked strength — while Lex Luthor’s machinations test the limits of truth, tech, and influence — Gathegi’s Mister Terrific operates in the grey area where ethics meet engineering. He’s the one parsing data while everyone else argues optics, designing solutions as Superman wrestles with the cost of being a symbol. </p>



<p>Mister Terrific is decisive, grounding the film’s big ideals in method and consequence. Gathegi plays him as a moral mathematician, weighing outcomes with calm authority, so when the plot pivots from spectacle to strategy, his presence feels essential. It’s a performance that could have easily gone unnoticed, but Gathegi makes it unforgettable. </p>



<h2>Andre Holland, <em>Love, Brooklyn</em></h2>







<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/andreholland/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Andre Holland</a> gives <a href=""https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/love-brooklyn-andre-holland-movie-review-2025"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Rachael Abigail Holder’s </a><em><a href=""https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/love-brooklyn-andre-holland-movie-review-2025"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Love, Brooklyn</a></em> its bruised, beating heart, turning a deceptively small story about dating in the city into something quietly expansive. As Roger, a writer drifting between relationships, neighborhoods, and versions of himself, Holland captures the ache of romantic limbo with a performance that’s all soft edges and sharp self-awareness. </p>



<p>The film unfolds across intimate Brooklyn spaces — apartments that feel borrowed, late-night conversations that blur into morning, chance encounters that reopen old wounds — as Roger navigates his lingering bond with his ex (Nicole Beharie) and a tentative new connection (DeWanda Wise). Holland plays these emotional crosscurrents with exquisite restraint, letting hesitation, guilt, and longing flicker across his face before a single word lands. What makes his work so compelling is how deeply he understands the film’s thesis: that love isn’t always about grand declarations, but about timing, honesty, and the courage to stop hiding in the in-between. In Holland’s hands, Roger is funny, charming, frustrating, and achingly recognizable; he’s a man learning, step by step, how to choose presence over comfort. Holland doesn’t get enough credit for consistently delivering devastating and entertaining performances. </p>



<h2>Susan Chardy, <em>On Becoming A Guinea Fowl </em></h2>







<p><a href=""https://www.vogue.com/article/susan-chardy-on-becoming-a-guinea-fowl-interview"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Susan Chardy gives </a><em><a href=""https://www.vogue.com/article/susan-chardy-on-becoming-a-guinea-fowl-interview"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">On Becoming a Guinea Fowl</a></em> its emotional spine, guiding us through Rungano Nyoni’s darkly surreal reckoning with family silence and collective denial. As Shula, Chardy moves through the aftermath of her uncle’s sudden death — discovered on a roadside at night — and the elaborate funeral rituals that follow, where aunties organize, gossip circulates, and everyone seems determined to smooth over the past rather than confront it. </p>



<p>While the film slips between realism and dreamlike interludes (guinea fowl skittering through memory, musical detours that feel like pressure valves), Chardy remains piercingly grounded, registering the weight of long-buried truths about abuse and complicity without ever spelling them out. Watch how she listens at the kitchen table, how her stillness cuts through the noise of ceremony, how her face hardens almost imperceptibly as the cost of silence becomes clear. Chardy doesn’t just play a woman at a funeral, she embodies the exhaustion of being awake in a room determined to keep sleeping, making Shula’s quiet resistance the film’s most radical act.</p>



<h2>Da’Vine Joy Randolph, <em>Eternity</em></h2>



<p>After <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/davine-joy-randolph-eternity-interview"">Da’Vine Joy Randolph</a> won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for <em>The Holdovers</em>, I was so excited to see her move into starring roles that were worthy of her talent. Playing secondary to Miles Teller in a rom-com starring Elizabeth Olsen wasn’t exactly what I had in mind. But <em>Eternity</em> surprised me, and Randolph is exceptional in it. This is what I <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/davine-joy-randolph-eternity-interview"">wrote about the film</a> last month: “Anna, the character, could easily fall into the magical negro trope, a one-note sidekick there in service of the white lead, but in Randolph’s hands (and thanks to her hysterical dynamic with Joan’s AC Ryan played by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/bejohnce/?hl=en"">John Early</a>), she’s more than that. Anna is the film’s constant comedic relief, and she’s also its moral center, a grounding force that’s there to remind Larry of the life he built with Joan for decades, while making us laugh repeatedly. That’s the power of Da’Vine Joy Randolph.”</p>

<h2>Delroy Lindo &amp; Miles Caton in <em>Sinners </em></h2>







<p>I couldn’t end this list without <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/04/11884333/sinners-true-story-robert-johnson-ryan-coogler-box-office-success"">mentioning Delroy Lindo</a> and <a href=""https://screenrant.com/sinners-sammie-miles-caton-first-performance-great/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miles Caton in </a><em><a href=""https://screenrant.com/sinners-sammie-miles-caton-first-performance-great/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sinners</a></em>. These two performances — one by a seasoned actor who has a career full of riveting characters, and the other by a brand new talent whose future is so blindingly bright — are just as integral to the success of <em>Sinners</em> as Jordan’s portrayal of Smoke and Stack or Mosaku’s Annie. </p>



<p>Lindo plays Delta Slim, a boozy blues musician who reluctantly agrees to play at the twins new juke joint. Caton’s Sammie is an aspiring musician who is eager to join his cousin in their new business venture. Both are at opposite ends of their musical pursuits, just like Caton and Lindo are at very different moments in their careers. But both characters are bound by their love of the blues, and their allegiance to their communities. While Sammie is naive, impatient, and yearning for adulthood, Delta Slim is wise, heedless yeet unflappable, and the surprising steady voice when the juke joint descends into chaos. </p>



<p>In a perfect world, both Lindo and Caton would be swatting away awards for these performances, but whether or not they are showered with the praise and accolades they deserve, both actors gave two of the most exhilarating performances on screen in 2025. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11922291.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings, we’ve made it to January 2026. And this isn’t just another new year…it’s a true reset. Numerologically, 2026 adds up to a 1, the number of beginnings, initiation, and fresh cycles. On a collective level, this is the kind of year astrologers talk about decades later. Saturn and Neptune both re-enter Aries this year — Saturn for two years, Neptune for over a decade. Aries is the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">very first sign of the zodiac</a>. This is the ignition point. The spark. And by February, we’ll also enter the Year of the Fire Horse, amplifying this sense that something powerful is waking up in the collective.</p>



<p>But here’s the thing: this doesn’t automatically make 2026 “easy.” It makes it <em>potent</em>. Saturn is in the final moments of wrapping its long journey through Pisces, the final sign of the zodiac. That means every sign has completed a wisdom initiation. We’ve all been stretched, softened, disillusioned, and re-sensitized over the last few years. Even if things still look chaotic (and yes, they are — Uranus remains in Taurus until July, and Pluto is only just settling into Aquarius for its 20-year stay), what’s actually happening is a massive soil-turning. Old systems are breaking down so something more fertile, more alive, and more sustainable can grow.</p>



<p>That’s why one of the biggest themes of January, and honestly, all of 2026, is<em> tending to your own garden.</em> Focus your energy where it can actually grow something. This January begins emotionally, intentionally, and intuitively with the Cancer New Moon on January 3rd, a powerful culmination of everything we processed in the last six months of 2025. That chapter taught us that even our pain can be transmuted into power. It’s a tender, feeling-forward start to the year — one that invites us to listen more deeply to our intuition instead of overriding it.</p>



<p>At the same time, we’re firmly in Capricorn Season until January 19th, with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars in Capricorn</a> for most of the month and Venus also moving through Capricorn. This grounds all that emotion into something practical. Every zodiac sign is being asked the same question: <em>What actually matters?</em> Financially, this is a strong month for getting yourself together: reviewing your budget, canceling subscriptions you don’t use, and daring to plan the next quarter from abundance rather than scarcity. This is boss energy, but the mature kind. The kind that builds something that lasts.</p>



<p>There’s also a noticeable shift in our collective healing story. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Chiron retrograde ends this month</a>, and that matters. The healing journey we’ve all been on isn’t disappearing… it’s becoming lighter, more creative, more joy-oriented. Healing doesn’t have to be endless excavation. It can be playful. It can be life-giving. And you’ll feel that shift early in the year.</p>



<p>Mid-month, the energy begins to pivot outward. Venus enters Aquarius on January 17th, reminding us that while Capricorn Season may have had us focused on survival and structure, we’re not meant to do this alone. Community matters — but Saturn has taught us discernment. Not everyone gets access to you. Venus in Aquarius isn’t about small talk or performative connection. It’s about people you can build new worlds with. Mutual care, mutual vision, mutual respect.</p>



<p>Then comes the full Aquarius activation. The sun enters Aquarius on January 19th, Mercury follows on January 20th, and Mars enters Aquarius on January 23rd. This is a powerful stellium for community-building, collective dreaming, and unconventional collaboration. If you’ve been thinking about starting a co-op, a startup, a mutual aid project, a community garden — this is your cosmic green light. The weirder, more innovative, and more future-focused, the better. This energy is preparing us for the Aquarius eclipse coming in February, which will further accelerate collective shifts toward equity and shared power. We’re already seeing the ripple effects of this Aquarius momentum worldwide, as communities demand systems that actually serve people.</p>



<p>And just when you think January couldn’t get any more electric, Neptune enters Aries on January 26th. This is huge. Neptune, the planet of dreams, ideals, and imagination, forming supportive connections with Mars and Mercury in Aquarius brings inspired action online. Vision meets movement and hope meets strategy.</p>



<p>Yes, Aquarius energy can bring stubbornness or power struggles if ego gets involved, but the deeper message of this month is simple and radical: <em>you don’t have to do everything alone anymore</em>. January asks us to breathe more easily, to let support circulate, and to extend that same relief to others — especially those with less access or privilege. That’s the real beginning. And that’s what makes this one of the most meaningful fresh starts of our lifetimes.  </p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, January opens on an emotional note with the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, illuminating your home, family, and inner foundation. This is a deeply personal reset. You may feel more sensitive than usual, nostalgic even, as memories, family dynamics, or questions about where (and with whom) you truly feel safe come to the surface. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-new-moon-in-sagittarius-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">This Full Moon</a> asks you to tend to your roots before charging ahead. You’re starting the year by acknowledging that strength doesn’t come from constant motion… it comes from having somewhere solid to land. Give yourself permission to feel it all, especially if the past six months stirred up emotions you didn’t have time to fully process.</p>



<p>At the same time, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars remains in Capricorn</a> for most of the month, activating your career, reputation, and long-term legacy sector. This creates an interesting contrast: emotional sensitivity at home, paired with serious ambition in public. You’re being asked to grow up in some way professionally: to take your goals more seriously, even if that means making tough, disciplined choices. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is especially potent for setting intentions around your work life, leadership, and the mark you want to leave behind. This is about playing the long game. You’re not just chasing success, you’re defining what success actually means to you.</p>



<p>Then the energy shifts noticeably. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars entering Aquarius on the 23rd, moving your focus from individual achievement to collective impact. Suddenly, you’re energized by community, technology, collaboration, and future-facing ideas. You may feel called to host, organize, share your insights, or step into a more visible role within a group or network.</p>



<p>And just days later, Neptune enters your sign on January 26th, where it will remain for over a decade. This is huge. It marks the beginning of a new era of dreaming, creating, and becoming for you. Your intuition sharpens, your imagination expands, and your presence becomes magnetic. This is your time to shine — not by shrinking yourself to fit expectations, but by fully embodying the bold, visionary, brilliant Aries you were born to be. The dreams you begin to believe in now have the power to become real.  </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831459.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, January begins with the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your communication, learning, and creative expression sector. This is a moment of culmination tied to the last six months, especially around how you speak up, share your ideas, write, teach, or tell your story. Conversations may come full circle, a message finally lands, or you realize how much your voice has evolved since mid-2025. At the start of the year, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-new-moon-in-sagittarius-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this Full Moon</a> invites you to honor your growth as a communicator and to trust that your words actually carry weight now. You’re not just talking… you’re transmitting something meaningful.</p>



<p>In the background, Mars moves steadily through Capricorn for most of the month, energizing your sector of higher learning, philosophy, long-distance travel, and big-picture thinking. This is productive, purposeful fire. You may feel motivated to commit to a course, apply for something abroad, plan a meaningful trip, or finally take an idea seriously that once felt too far off or impractical. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is especially supportive for setting intentions around expansion that’s sustainable; travel with purpose, learning that leads somewhere, or spiritual growth that’s actually integrated into daily life. This isn’t escapism; it’s evolution.</p>



<p>Then the tone shifts dramatically in the final third of the month. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, lighting up your career, public image, and long-term direction. Suddenly, visibility increases. People notice you. Opportunities arise that ask you to step up or stand out in a new way — especially through innovation, leadership, or unconventional paths. At the same time, Neptune enters Aries on January 26th, activating your spirituality, healing, and subconscious realm. The magic of this month is learning how to merge both: ambition <em>and</em> inner alignment. You’re being asked to build a life that honors your calling without abandoning your soul. It’s an exciting shift… one that reminds you that success hits different when it’s rooted in meaning. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831461.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, January begins with the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your money, values, and self-worth sector. This is a culmination tied to the last six months around income, stability, and how you value your time, energy, and talents. You may receive clarity around what’s sustainable and what’s draining you financially or energetically. At the very start of the year, this Full Moon asks you to get emotionally honest about security — not just what you earn, but what actually makes you feel safe. There’s a strong message here: your worth is no longer negotiable.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars spends most of January in Capricorn</a>, moving through your sector of shared resources, debts, investments, and deep emotional entanglements. This is intense but productive energy. You may be actively restructuring finances that involve other people: taxes, loans, inheritances, subscriptions, or business partnerships. Emotionally, this can also stir up questions about trust, power, and reciprocity. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is an ideal moment to set intentions around financial cleanup, long-term investments, or releasing attachments that feel too heavy to carry into this new cycle. This is about taking responsibility for your future… not fearfully, but strategically.</p>



<p>The final third of the month brings a noticeable lift. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, with Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, activating your sector of higher learning, travel, publishing, and expanded perspective. Your curiosity reignites. You may feel pulled toward teaching, studying, sharing your ideas publicly, or planning a trip that changes how you see the world.</p>



<p>Then, Neptune enters Aries on January 26th, illuminating your community, friendships, and long-term dreams for the next decade. This is where hope returns. You’re reminded that you don’t have to figure everything out alone… your people, your collaborators, your future allies are finding you. January ultimately shifts you from survival mode into vision mode. And that’s a powerful way to begin a year of one.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831462.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, January is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/being-boring-is-good"">your personal reset</a>. Your annual New Moon arrives early, on January 3rd, in your sign, marking one of the most important moments of your entire year. This is a rebirth point, emotionally, energetically, and intuitively. The past six months have likely asked you to release old identities, patterns, or versions of yourself that no longer felt safe or true. Now, you get to choose who you’re becoming. You may feel more sensitive, reflective, or inward at the start of the year, but that’s because your intuition is loud and clear. This New Moon asks you to trust your instincts and set intentions that honor <em>how you want to feel</em>, not just what you want to achieve.</p>



<p>At the same time, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars spends most of January in Capricorn</a>, directly opposing your sign and activating your partnership sector. Relationships — romantic, professional, and personal — are front and center. This can bring clarity around commitment, boundaries, and shared responsibility. You may be asked to meet others halfway, even if that feels uncomfortable at first. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th deepens this theme, offering a moment to reset agreements, redefine expectations, or make a serious decision about who you’re building with long-term. This is about choosing relationships that can support the version of you that’s emerging now.</p>



<p>The energy lightens and expands in the final third of the month. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, shifting your focus toward intimacy, healing, and shared resources. You’re encouraged to have honest conversations about money, trust, and emotional exchange. Then, on January 26th, Neptune enters Aries, beginning a long-term chapter in your career and public life. Over the next decade, you’re learning how to align your work with your intuition and compassion. January ends by reminding you that when you honor your emotional truth, you don’t just feel safer… you become more powerful. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831463.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, January begins quietly with the Cancer New Moon on January 3rd, activating your sector of rest, healing, and subconscious processing. This is not your usual spotlight moment… and that’s intentional. The start of the year invites you to slow down, go inward, and release emotional weight you’ve been carrying since mid-2025. You may feel more introspective, more tired, or more aware of what needs to end rather than begin. This New Moon is about closure, forgiveness, and making peace with the past so you don’t drag it into the next chapter. Think of it as energetic decluttering before the glow up.</p>



<p>At the same time, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars moves through Capricorn</a> for most of the month, activating your work, health, and daily routine sector. While emotionally you’re in a reflective space, practically you’re being asked to get your life together. This is prime energy for committing to healthier habits, refining your schedule, or taking your responsibilities more seriously, especially if you’ve been running on autopilot. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th offers a powerful moment to reset your routines and make sustainable changes that support your long-term vitality. Small shifts now can have major ripple effects.</p>



<p>The energy shifts dramatically in the final third of the month. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, activating your partnership sector. Suddenly, other people matter more, romantically, creatively, and professionally. Conversations get real, and decisions about commitment, collaboration, or boundaries come into focus. And then, Neptune enters Aries on January 26th, opening a long-term chapter of spiritual growth, faith, and expanded perspective. January ends by reminding you that rest is not a retreat… it’s preparation. You’re clearing space so <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/being-boring-is-good"">your next era</a> can arrive fully formed.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831464.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, January opens with the Cancer New Moon on January 3rd, activating your sector of friendships, community, and long-term goals. This marks a meaningful culmination connected to the last six months, especially around who you’ve been building with and which dreams are still worth your energy. You may feel a shift in your social circle, a renewed sense of belonging, or clarity about which visions you want to commit to in this new cycle. At the start of the year, this New Moon asks you to stop doing everything alone and to trust that aligned support exists.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars spends most of the month in Capricorn</a>, moving through your creativity, romance, and passion sector. This is productive, focused fire… less about fantasy, more about commitment. You’re being encouraged to take something you love seriously, whether that’s a creative project, a romantic connection, or your relationship with joy itself. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is especially potent for setting intentions around pleasure that’s sustainable, creative work that has structure, or dating with clearer standards. This is about showing up consistently for what lights you up.</p>



<p>The final third of the month brings a noticeable pivot. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, shifting your attention to work, wellness, and daily systems. You may feel motivated to streamline your schedule, adopt new tools or technologies, or rethink how you manage your time and energy.</p>



<p>Then, Neptune enters Aries on January 26th, beginning a long-term chapter of emotional healing and deeper intimacy. January ends by reminding you that when your routines support your passions — and your boundaries support your heart — you don’t just function better, you thrive.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831465.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, January begins with the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, spotlighting your career, visibility, and public life. This is a culmination moment connected to the last six months of effort, especially around leadership, recognition, or a role you’ve been growing into since mid-2025. You may receive feedback, validation, or clarity about where you stand professionally and what no longer feels emotionally sustainable. Starting the year this way can feel intense, but it’s also empowering. You’re being asked to define success on your own terms, not just perform it for others.</p>



<p>At the same time, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars moves through Capricorn</a> for most of the month, activating your home, family, and inner foundation sector. While your outer life is visible, your inner life is under construction. You may be dealing with family responsibilities, a move, home projects, or emotional patterns rooted in the past. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is a powerful reset point for your private world, setting intentions around stability, boundaries with family, or creating a living situation that actually supports your nervous system. This is about building a base that can hold you as your ambitions grow.</p>



<p>The final third of the month brings a shift toward joy and connection. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, activating your creativity, romance, and self-expression sector. You’re reminded that pleasure, play, and inspiration are not distractions — they’re fuel. Then, Neptune enters Aries on January 26th, beginning a long-term chapter of spiritual growth through relationships. Over the next decade, partnerships become mirrors for healing, compassion, and deeper understanding. January ends by asking you to choose relationships and creative outlets that feel expansive, honest, and alive.</p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, January opens with the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, illuminating your sector of belief, higher learning, travel, and meaning. This is a culmination tied to the last six months of growth around your worldview: what you believe, what you stand for, and what feels worth your devotion. You may have a realization that changes how you see your future, or you could finally release an old philosophy, plan, or story that no longer fits who you’re becoming. Starting the year this way feels expansive and emotional at once. You’re being reminded that growth isn’t just about doing more… it’s about aligning with a truth that actually sustains you.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars spends most of January in Capricorn</a>, activating your communication, thinking, and daily movement sector. This is sharp, productive energy for writing, speaking, teaching, negotiating, or making concrete plans. Your mind is focused, strategic, and direct. Conversations carry weight now, especially ones you may have been avoiding. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is a powerful moment to set intentions around how you communicate, what you commit to mentally, and how you manage your time and energy day to day. This is about discipline in thought, not obsession — choosing clarity over noise.</p>



<p>The final third of the month brings an inward but grounding shift. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, activating your home, family, and emotional foundation. You may feel called to reorganize your space, redefine family dynamics, or spend more time nesting and grounding yourself.</p>



<p>Then, Neptune enters Aries on January 26th, beginning a long-term chapter of healing through work, wellness, and daily rituals. Over the next decade, your relationship with your body, your labor, and your purpose evolves in a more intuitive, compassionate direction.

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, January begins with the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your sector of intimacy, shared resources, and energetic exchange. This is a culmination tied to the last six months around trust: who you merge with emotionally, financially, or spiritually, and where power dynamics have needed healing. You may gain clarity around a financial arrangement, a deep relationship, or an emotional attachment that’s ready to transform. Starting the year this way can feel intense, but it’s also clarifying. You’re learning that vulnerability isn’t a loss of freedom… it’s a different kind of strength.</p>



<p>At the same time, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars moves through Capricorn</a> for most of the month, grounding your focus in money, self-worth, and material stability. This is about taking responsibility for your resources and recognizing your value in very real, tangible ways. You may feel motivated to increase income, tighten your budget, or commit to a long-term financial plan that supports your independence. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is especially powerful for setting intentions around earnings, pricing your work fairly, or building security without sacrificing joy. This is practical ambition that actually supports your freedom.</p>



<p>The energy lightens and speeds up in the final third of the month. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, activating your communication, learning, and local connection sector. Conversations spark ideas. Writing, teaching, pitching, or sharing your perspective feels energizing again.</p>



<p>Then, Neptune enters Aries on January 26th, beginning a long-term chapter of creative and romantic awakening. Over the next decade, joy becomes more intuitive, love more inspired, and creativity more fearless.

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, January begins with the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your partnership sector and bringing relationship themes front and center. This is a culmination tied to the last six months around commitment, collaboration, and emotional reciprocity. You may receive clarity about who’s truly showing up for you, and where imbalance has lingered too long. Starting the year this way asks you to soften without losing your edge. This Full Moon reminds you that strength doesn’t mean carrying everything alone; it means choosing connections that meet you in the middle.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mars spends most of January in your sign, giving you drive, momentum, and a sense of personal authority that’s hard to ignore. You’re more decisive, more visible, and more willing to take up space. This is a powerful time to initiate personal goals, redefine your identity, or step into leadership in a way that feels embodied rather than forced. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is especially important for you — it’s a personal reset. Set intentions around how you want to move through the world this year, what version of yourself you’re committing to, and what you’re no longer willing to tolerate. This is about conscious self-definition.</p>



<p>The final third of the month shifts your focus outward. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, activating your money, values, and resource sector. Conversations around income, pricing, and long-term security come into focus, but in a more innovative, future-oriented way.</p>



<p>Then, Neptune enters Aries on January 26th, beginning a long-term chapter centered on home, emotional healing, and inner belonging. Over the next decade, you’re learning that true stability isn’t just built externally… it’s cultivated from within. January ends with you standing taller, clearer, and more aligned with the life you’re intentionally creating.</p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, January begins with the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your work, wellness, and daily life sector. This is a culmination tied to the last six months around how you manage your energy, time, and responsibilities. You may feel emotionally aware of what’s been sustainable, and what absolutely hasn’t. Starting the year this way brings clarity around burnout, boundaries, and the need to care for your body as much as your vision. This Full Moon asks you to stop sacrificing yourself for productivity and to build routines that actually support your long-term health.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars spends most of January in Capricorn</a>, moving through your sector of rest, healing, and subconscious processing. This is quieter but powerful energy. You may feel called to slow down, work behind the scenes, or release habits and patterns that have been draining you for years. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is a potent moment for intention-setting around rest, spiritual practices, and emotional closure. You’re clearing space — consciously or not — for something new to enter. Trust that what’s dissolving now is making room for your next era.</p>



<p>And then, everything shifts. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering your sign on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, launching you into visibility, momentum, and renewed confidence. You’re sharper, bolder, and more expressive: ready to initiate ideas, lead conversations, and be seen as yourself without editing. This is amplified even more when Neptune enters Aries on January 26th, activating your communication and thought sector for the next decade. Your voice becomes visionary. Your ideas carry inspiration. January ends with you stepping fully into your power, reminding you that when you honor rest first, your brilliance lands even louder.</p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, January opens with the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, illuminating your creativity, romance, pleasure, and self-expression sector. This is a culmination tied to the last six months around joy: what lights you up, who makes you feel alive, and where you may have dimmed yourself out of obligation or exhaustion. Emotions run deep, but in a beautiful way. You may feel more expressive, more romantic, or more connected to your inner child at the start of the year. This Full Moon reminds you that joy is not frivolous… it’s medicine, and it’s essential to your healing.</p>



<p>At the same time, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars moves through Capricorn</a> for most of the month, activating your friendships, community, and long-term goals sector. This brings a grounded, purposeful energy to collaboration. You may feel motivated to commit to a group project, take a leadership role within your community, or get serious about a dream that requires teamwork. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is a powerful moment to set intentions around the future you want to build, and who you want beside you as you do. This is about choosing aligned allies and releasing connections that no longer feel reciprocal.</p>



<p>The final third of the month brings a subtle but meaningful shift. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, encouraging rest, reflection, and behind-the-scenes work. You may feel called to step back slightly, recharge, or prepare quietly for something new. Then, Neptune, your ruling planet, enters Aries on January 26th, beginning a long-term chapter focused on self-worth, resources, and embodiment. Over the next decade, you’re learning to ground your dreams in reality, to value yourself more boldly, and to build stability without sacrificing your magic. January ends with a gentle but powerful message: your sensitivity is your strength, and this year, it’s meant to support you, not drain you.</p>

<p>Happy New Year! It’s fair to say we are all ready to move on from 2025, which is why it’s fantastic that the horoscope for the last night of the year <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">is giving positivity</a>. </p>



<p>The moon sets the vibe, as it moves from indulgent Taurus to witty Gemini on December 31st. On New Year’s Eve, the moon will be in Gemini, allowing us to communicate freely and be our most authentic selves. </p>



<p>December 31st is a time of mixed energies, due to the Gemini Moon, in which we may start the night with one idea in motion and end up at another party. Prepare yourself for the unexpected and go with the flow. Mercury shifts from Sagittarius to Capricorn on New Year’s Day, immediately aspecting the Nodes of Destiny. This cosmic change motivates us to get on track ASAP. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/budgeting-tools-spending-diary"">Our goals for 2026</a> start faster than we can even process them, so let’s go!</p>

<h2>Aries</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Aries</a>, rather than doing the same thing you’ve always done, you’ll find you’re in the mood for different activities. Check if anyone in your circle is hosting a party and attend the gathering. It’ll be nice not to have to host and deal with the cleanup. Now, your primary focus is on socializing and having fun. </p>

<h2>Taurus </h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Taurus</a>, the only thing holding you back from balling around town with friends is your lack of funds to support this endeavor. Even if it means having to live on a budget and cutting back for the next few weeks, you won’t want to miss out on the good vibes and times that New Year’s Day brings.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>

<h2>Gemini </h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Gemini</a>, you’re feeling more like the social butterfly that you are, which means that you’ll be party hopping all night long. The caveat to this plan is that you might meet a stranger who will bring butterflies to your stomach, making you want to stay longer at one event than the others to connect with them.</p>

<h2>Cancer</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Cancer</a>, you’re longing for a low-key New Year’s Eve, which means spending time at home with a few close friends. Invite them over for a chilled out dinner and game night. You’ll have fun celebrating the new year, playing games that bring everyone together, and laughing all night long. The bond you create will bring you closer.</p>

<h2>Leo</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Leo</a>, New Year’s Eve will definitely be one of those nights where you end up singing karaoke at a dive bar. You’ll be surrounded by your squad, who will encourage you to cut loose and sing your own rendition and remix of Taylor Swift’s songs. The results are iconic and worthy of a social media post.</p>

<h2>Virgo</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Virgo</a>, You might get caught up in some serious professional drama if you don’t log out of your email account. Even though it’s a holiday, there is a chance that an issue needs to be addressed before the year wraps up. Put the matter on ice before it consumes your evening. Don’t be in the work zone.</p>

<h2>Libra</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Libra</a>, heading out of town for a unique New Year’s Eve experience is the best choice you’ll ever make. Not only will you immerse yourself in the vitality of the enchanting place you visit, but you’ll also feel a sense of refreshment and reinvigoration, as you’re in an area that radiates fresh energy and sense of adventure.</p>

<h2>Scorpio</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio</a>, you may not be able to stay up until the ball drops, but you’ll try. Therefore, you must put on your pajamas when watching the final episode of <em>Stranger Things</em>. Your significant other/crush won’t mind holding you close and tight during the scary moments of the show and having you fall asleep in their arms. </p>

<h2>Sagittarius</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Sag</a>, put your spirited ways aside this New Year’s Eve and focus on romance. Go out for an intimate dinner for two and come back to a warm, loving home. You’ll be glad that you took the time to be alone with your significant other on the momentous evening. Take photos to crystallize the night together. </p>

<h2>Capricorn</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Capricorn</a>, you might overdo it with the champagne on your leaving, resulting in an intense hangover the next day. If you’re abstaining from alcohol, then you might just be exhausted and in need of relaxation on New Year’s Day. All in all, try to keep the vibe cool and not take it to the extreme.</p>

It’s not about how you present it for onlookers on Instagram and TikTok; it’s about the people you’re with, and the aura it brings. Wear your 2026 glasses and hat without caring about what others have to say. YOLO!</p>

<p>Cosmic beings, we’ve made it to the final week of 2025, and the threshold of 2026. And honestly? This doesn’t feel like a light, glittery end-of-year moment. This week carries weight. We’re closing out a year of nine, a numerological cycle of completion, karmic closure, and spiritual awakening — often delivered through loss, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/05/11382835/time-management-makeover-productivity-trap"">surrender, and rebirth</a>. On top of that, we’re nearing the end of the Year of the Snake, a long initiation marked by shedding skin slowly, deliberately, sometimes painfully. Even if the letting go happened in baby steps, it still counts. This is the end of a very long cycle, and the body knows it.</p>



<p>Astrologically, the seriousness is unmistakable. Capricorn Season dominates the sky, with a growing stellium that includes Mars, the sun, Venus, and soon Juno entering Capricorn on December 29th, followed by Mercury entering Capricorn on January 1st. This isn’t party energy — it’s legacy energy. Yes, festivities may still happen, especially early in the week, but the collective mood is more reflective than performative. What people really want right now is clarity around purpose, direction, and what they’re building next. And that clarity may not arrive instantly. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Capricorn teaches us</a> that some truths only come through patience, discipline, and showing up even when the answers aren’t fully formed yet.</p>



<p>This is also <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-new-moon-in-sagittarius-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">a Full Moon week</a>, with the emotional intensity building as early as December 29th, leading to the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd. A Capricorn stellium paired with a Cancer Full Moon is a powerful polarity: ambition versus emotion, structure versus sensitivity, duty versus care. This combination brings up deep questions about what we’re working toward, and <em>why</em>. It asks us to feel what we’ve been pushing through, to acknowledge the emotional cost of growth, and to decide what’s actually worth carrying forward. Adding to this intensity, Chiron, the asteroid of our core wounds and healing, stations direct on January 2nd at 9:38 a.m. EST, amplifying the emotional release of this lunation. We’re not just feeling things… we’re transmuting them.</p>



<p>When 2026 officially begins, there’s no room left for self-pity. With Mercury in Capricorn and Chiron moving forward in Aries, the message is clear: we rise again. We’re the warrior who gets back up after being knocked down — not because it’s easy, but because we’ve learned how. The Cancer Full Moon allows us to feel everything, fully and honestly, so we can move forward unburdened. And the fact that the week <em>after</em> this Full Moon is astrologically quiet is no accident. It’s an integration period, a sacred pause to embody the new version of ourselves stepping into a Year of One, the year of initiation and fresh beginnings. We end 2025 with emotional clarity, not illusions. And that, cosmic beings, is a blessing.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, the year doesn’t end quietly for you… it ends with a résumé review and an existential pop quiz. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury enters Capricorn on January 1st, the final days of 2025 and the first moments of 2026 are dominated by serious Capricorn energy in your career and legacy sector. This isn’t just about what you do for work, it’s about what you want to be <em>known</em> for. Reputation, impact, authority, and long-term influence are on your mind. You might catch yourself thinking less “what’s my next move?” and more “what am I building that actually matters?” It’s giving CEO energy, but also philosopher. The upside: you feel powerful, focused, and clear-eyed about your potential. The shadow? Taking yourself a little <em>too</em> seriously — overworking, micromanaging, or forgetting that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bed-rotting-trend-tiktok"">you’re allowed to rest</a>. The move here is to embody leadership without turning life into a performance review.</p>



<p>Then comes the emotional release. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in your sign, and just one day later, the Cancer Full Moon lands in your home and foundation sector. This is big. After months of revisiting old wounds around identity, confidence, and self-trust, Chiron moving forward feels like a quiet but undeniable shift: <em>I’ve survived this, and I’m stronger for it.</em> The Cancer Full Moon invites you to feel everything you’ve been holding together with duct tape: family stuff, inner child stuff, the pressure of always having to be “the strong one.” Let it move through you. Cry if you need to. Clean your space. Have a real conversation. This isn’t weakness… it’s integration. You’re ending the year with emotional clarity and starting the next one grounded in who you actually are, not who you thought you had to be.</p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, the year wraps up with big “zoom out” energy for you. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury enters Capricorn on January 1st, Capricorn energy dominates your beliefs, purpose, and long-term vision sector. You’re less interested in the day-to-day grind and more focused on the <em>why</em> behind it all. This can look like questioning old goals, rethinking a path you once assumed you’d take, or realizing you’ve outgrown a belief system that no longer reflects who you are. It’s giving “I need my life to make sense, actually.” The upside is clarity and maturity… your worldview is evolving. The shadow? Becoming a little rigid or self-righteous about what’s “right.” Stay open. Expansion doesn’t have to come with a superiority complex.</p>



<p>Then the emotional download hits. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your subconscious and communication sectors. You may feel old fears, insecurities, or unspoken truths rise to the surface, especially ones you’ve buried because they felt inconvenient or messy. This is a release moment. Conversations can be healing, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/01/11636388/daily-journaling-mental-health-benefits"">journaling can be cathartic</a>, and rest is non-negotiable. Let yourself name what you’ve been avoiding. This full moon helps you clear mental clutter so you can step into 2026 lighter, calmer, and more emotionally honest. You’re not losing stability… you’re redefining it from the inside out.</p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, the year ends with you doing emotional math you can’t spreadsheet your way out of. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury (your ruler) enters Capricorn on January 1st, the final days of 2025 and the opening of 2026 activate your intimacy, shared resources, and power sector. This is about money you share, energy you exchange, and the unspoken contracts in your closest relationships. You may find yourself asking some very Capricorn-coded questions like: <em>Is this sustainable? Am I giving more than I’m getting? Who actually has access to me like this?</em> The upside is maturity and discernment. The shadow is overthinking or emotionally detaching instead of feeling what’s there. Just because you can intellectualize something doesn’t mean you should avoid processing it.</p>



<p>Then things get real in the best way. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, and on January 3rd, the Cancer Full Moon lights up your money and self-worth sector. Translation: the healing work around belonging, friendship, and feeling “chosen” starts moving forward, and it shows up in how you value yourself. This Full Moon asks you to stop underpricing your time, your labor, and your emotional availability. You may realize you’ve been saying yes out of habit or guilt instead of alignment. Let it go. This is a clearing moment that helps you step into 2026 knowing your worth without needing external validation to confirm it. Less explaining. More embodying.</p>

<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, the year ends with the spotlight firmly on your relationships and commitments. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury enters Capricorn on January 1st, Capricorn energy continues to activate your partnership sector, making the final days of 2025 and the first moments of 2026 feel serious, clarifying, and no-nonsense. This isn’t about romance alone… it’s about who you’re building life with, who shows up consistently, and who’s actually aligned with your long-term vision. You may find yourself thinking less “do I like this?” and more “can this last?” The upside is emotional maturity and clarity. The shadow is being overly guarded or testing people instead of trusting what you already know. Not every connection needs to prove itself under interrogation.</p>



<p>Then comes the emotional crescendo. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, and on January 3rd, the Full Moon lands in your sign, opening 2026 with undeniable intensity. This is <em>your</em> annual Full Moon — an emotional release, a rebirth, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eat-pray-love-era-generational-appeal"">a reset all in one</a>. After months of pressure around visibility, responsibility, and proving yourself, you’re finally allowed to feel everything you’ve been holding together so gracefully. This Full Moon helps you shed old identities, outdated expectations, and emotional armor you no longer need. You’re not the same person you were at the start of the year… and that’s the point. You enter 2026 softer, clearer, and deeply grounded in what you need to thrive.</p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, the year wraps up with a very unglamorous but extremely necessary reality check, and honestly, it’s doing you favors. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury enters Capricorn on January 1st, Capricorn energy continues to activate your work, health, and daily life sector. Translation: routines, responsibilities, and the systems holding your life together are under review. You might find yourself reflecting on how you actually spend your time versus how you <em>say</em> you do. Legacy questions come up, but in a grounded way: <em>What kind of life am I sustaining day after day? Is this pace even healthy?</em> The upside is clarity and discipline. The shadow is being overly critical of yourself or turning productivity into self-worth. You’re allowed to be human, not just efficient.</p>



<p>Then comes the emotional release valve. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your rest, healing, and subconscious sector. This is a deep exhale moment. Old fears, grief, or exhaustion you’ve been pushing through finally surface so they can be released. You might feel more tired than usual, more introspective, or in need of solitude — and that’s not a flaw, it’s integration. Let yourself slow down. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/01/11636388/daily-journaling-mental-health-benefits"">Cancel plans. Sleep. Journal</a>. This Full Moon is clearing emotional residue from 2025 so you don’t carry it into 2026. You’re not disappearing… you’re restoring. And that’s how the next chapter actually gets to shine.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, the year closes with you taking joy seriously, and not in a cheesy way. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury (your ruler) enters Capricorn on January 1st, Capricorn energy continues to activate your creativity, romance, and self-expression sector. This isn’t about chasing fun for fun’s sake; it’s about asking what actually nourishes you. You may find yourself reflecting on which passions are worth committing to, which relationships feel aligned with your future self, and where you’ve been treating pleasure like a reward instead of a necessity. The upside is clarity and devotion to what truly matters. The shadow? Over-curating your happiness or putting pressure on yourself to “optimize” joy. Let it be real, not perfect.</p>



<p>Then the emotional shift lands. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your community, friendships, and long-term goals sector. This is a release moment around belonging — who you feel safe dreaming with and where you’ve outgrown certain circles. You may realize that some connections were season-long, not lifetime ones, and that’s okay. The Full Moon helps you let go of people-pleasing and step into more emotionally honest alignment. You enter 2026 clearer about who’s on your team and what future you’re actually working toward. Less obligation, more intention.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, the year closes with you getting extremely honest about what “home” actually means. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury enters Capricorn on January 1st, Capricorn energy continues to activate your home, family, and emotional foundation sector. This isn’t just about your physical space… it’s about what (and who) grounds you when no one’s watching. You may find yourself reflecting on family dynamics, living situations, or emotional patterns you’ve outgrown. It’s giving “I love you, but this setup no longer works for me.” The upside is maturity and self-respect. The shadow is feeling guilty for wanting stability on <em>your</em> terms. Reminder: prioritizing your nervous system is not selfish, it’s necessary.</p>



<p>Then comes the emotional peak. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your career and public life sector. This is a big moment around visibility and self-trust. Old wounds tied to approval, partnership dynamics, or fear of being judged may surface — especially if you’ve been shrinking yourself to keep the peace. Let it rise so it can release. This Full Moon helps you reclaim authority over your path and redefine success in a way that feels emotionally sustainable. You’re stepping into 2026 clearer about where you’re going, and more importantly, who you no longer need permission from to get there.</p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, the year ends with your mind in full executive mode. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury follows on January 1st, Capricorn energy continues to activate your communication, thinking, and decision-making sector. You’re not in the mood for vague plans, emotional spirals, or conversations that go nowhere. This is about clarity, boundaries, and saying exactly what you mean, with fewer disclaimers. You may find yourself reflecting on how you’ve been using your voice all year: what you’ve said, what you’ve withheld, and where silence was strategic versus self-sabotaging. The upside is sharp focus and authority. The shadow? Becoming overly blunt or emotionally armored. Precision doesn’t require coldness, just intention.</p>



<p>Then comes the perspective shift. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your beliefs, purpose, and long-term vision sector. This is a moment of emotional truth around what you actually believe in, and whether your life reflects it. Old wounds tied to burnout, over-responsibility, or “doing everything yourself” come up so they can finally move forward. The Full Moon may bring a realization that changes how you see your future, your faith, or your next chapter entirely. Let it land. You’re ending 2025 with mental clarity and entering 2026 with emotional alignment. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/being-boring-is-good"">No drama… Just evolution.</a></p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, the year closes with your attention firmly on money, value, and sustainability. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury enters Capricorn on January 1st, Capricorn energy continues to activate your income and self-worth sector. This isn’t about restriction, it’s about reality. You’re taking a long, honest look at what you earn, what you spend, and what your time is actually worth. Legacy questions come up here too, but in a very tangible way: <em>How do I support the life I say I want?</em> The upside is clarity and empowerment. The shadow is spiraling into “ugh, capitalism” energy instead of making practical moves. You don’t have to sell your soul… you just have to stop winging it.</p>



<p>Then the emotional release lands. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your creativity, joy, and intimacy sectors. This is a powerful moment around healing wounds tied to pleasure, romance, and feeling chosen, while also releasing emotional or financial entanglements that have felt heavy or unclear. You may realize you’ve been over-giving, over-merging, or carrying responsibility that isn’t actually yours. Let it go. This Full Moon helps you reset boundaries around energy and trust so you can enter 2026 lighter, freer, and more emotionally honest. Stability doesn’t <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/being-boring-is-good"">have to feel boring</a>, and this week proves it.</p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, this is your week… and you feel it. As Juno enters your sign on December 29th and Mercury enters Capricorn on January 1st, the end of 2025 and the beginning of 2026 revolve squarely around <em>you</em>. Identity, commitments, boundaries, and self-definition are front and center. This isn’t about proving anything anymore — it’s about deciding who you’re willing to be accountable to, including yourself. You may feel more serious, more focused, and more intentional about how you show up in the world. The upside is authority and clarity. The shadow? Carrying the weight of the world like it’s your job. Reminder: leadership doesn’t mean self-erasure. You’re allowed to be powerful <em>and</em> human.</p>



<p>Then the emotional truth hits. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your home, family, and partnership axis. This brings deep feelings around belonging, emotional safety, and the roles you’ve played for others, sometimes at your own expense. Old wounds tied to family dynamics, vulnerability, or letting others support you may surface so they can finally move forward. Let yourself feel it without turning it into a to-do list. This Full Moon helps you soften the armor just enough to start 2026 emotionally aligned, not just externally successful. You’re not losing control… you’re gaining balance.</p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, the year ends with you in low-battery-but-high-awareness mode. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury enters Capricorn on January 1st, the Capricorn pile-up activates your rest, retreat, and subconscious sector. Translation: you’re done explaining yourself, done overextending, and done pretending you’re not tired. This is a deeply reflective moment where legacy questions surface privately, not publicly. Instead of asking <em>what am I building?</em> You’re asking <em>what needs to end so I can build anything at all?</em> The upside is profound clarity and emotional maturity. The shadow is isolation or ghosting instead of communicating needs. You don’t have to disappear to protect your energy. Quiet boundaries work too.</p>



<p>Then the reset arrives. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your work, wellness, and daily life sector. This is a release around burnout, obligation, and the pressure to always be useful. You may finally admit that a routine, job, or responsibility has been costing you more than it’s giving. Let that truth land. This Full Moon helps you clear emotional residue from 2025 so you can enter 2026 with healthier systems, and less resentment. You’re not here to martyr yourself for the future. You’re here to build it sustainably.</p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, the year closes with you getting very selective about your future and the people in it. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury follows suit on January 1st, Capricorn energy activates your community, friendships, and long-term vision sector. You’re not interested in vague dreams or feel-good group chats anymore. This is about asking real questions: <em>Who am I building with? Who actually shows up? What future do I want to commit to?</em> You may feel less tolerant of flaky dynamics and more drawn to people who match your effort and integrity. The upside is discernment and maturity. The shadow is cynicism and assuming no one can meet you where you are. Stay open, but stay real.</p>



<p>Then the emotional release arrives. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your creativity, joy, romance, and inner child sector. This is a powerful moment of healing around worthiness, especially the belief that joy has to be earned or justified. Old wounds tied to money, self-esteem, or being chosen soften and begin to move forward. Let yourself feel happiness without overanalyzing it. Create something. Laugh. Rest. This Full Moon reminds you that pleasure is not a distraction from your purpose — it’s part of it. You enter 2026 lighter, clearer, and more emotionally aligned with what actually makes life feel worth living.</p>
