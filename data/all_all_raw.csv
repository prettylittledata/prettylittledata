<p>In <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/contemporary-architecture"">contemporary architecture</a>, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/search/projects/categories/commercial-and-offices"">commercial spaces</a> have become more than points of sale; they are stages where identity, image, and experience converge. Stores, showrooms, and branded interiors often operate as laboratories where architects experiment with form, material, and light, translating corporate narratives into spatial experiences. In this context, the architect emerges as a mediator of desire, shaping atmospheres that guide perception, evoke emotion, and subtly influence behavior. This role reveals a complex intersection between <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/884086/hate-contemporary-architecture-blame-economics-not-architects"">design and capitalism</a>: the creation of spaces that sell not only products, but also aspirations, lifestyles, and cultural meaning. By transforming commerce into an architectural performance, these projects invite reflection on how the discipline negotiates its agency in a world where visibility and image have become as essential as function.</p>",

<h4>How business management killed craft apprenticeship</h4><p>Victor Wooten is my all-time favorite bassist. But, it’s not only because of his amazing playing skills. It’s also his philosophy of teaching music.</p><p>He runs music camps where complete beginners are invited to come jam with him, the professional musician. His philosophy is simple: there are no wrong notes, no punishment or judgement for misfit notes. What matters…is what you do after you play them. Wooten points out that this is how babies learn language. They’re allowed to “jam” with professionals from day one. It would be absurd if we made children practice grammar alone until they were fluent enough to speak with adults. But, that’s typically how music is taught, and it takes too long.</p><figure><img alt=""Drawing of man holding a bass saying “Let’s jam!”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*3UfW5S2pQDmlJwDQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption><em>Invite the juniors to jam with the experts!</em></figcaption></figure><p>I’ve been playing bass for quite a few years and Wooten’s approach resonates with how I actually learned the most. Sure books and courses are helpful, but it’s jamming with other people (better than me), watching how they think in real time, deciding when to hold back, when to step forward, how to recover when something doesn’t land. That’s where a lot of the breakthroughs happen. And, that’s what Cal Newport calls career capital: the skills you build by working next to people who already have them. Reading about the skills are helpful, but you need to be “in the room jamming” with people to really get the full effect.</p><p>And that’s exactly what we’ve stopped doing in design.</p><h3>The False Binary We’ve Created</h3><p>When you move from individual contributor to design leader, the fear of micromanagement sets in. You’re told “don’t dictate pixels” and “don’t hover over your team’s shoulders”. You’re told to stay strategic. The message is clear: good managers stay out of the details. And for good reason: nobody wants a boss who controls every decision and undermines their team’s autonomy. So design leaders internalize this rule and step back from craft entirely.</p><figure><img alt=""Two choices: crushing micromanagement or craft abandonment. It’s a trap."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*38oeV_F9PyenUUGG.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Design leaders feel forced to chose micromanagement or uninvolvement.</figcaption></figure><p>You’re faced with two choices:</p><ul><li><strong>The “Wrong” One:</strong> Stay hands-on with craft, but risk micromanaging, dictating pixels, and undercutting team autonomy</li><li><strong>The “Right” One:</strong> Stay strategic and high-level, stay out of their work, leave craft to the individual contributors</li></ul><p>Management in the design industry has overwhelmingly chosen to stay out of craft. Design leaders believe “Good managers don’t get sucked into the details” or “I empower my team by staying high level.” Sounds right. Sounds like good management.</p><p>If that’s the “right” decision, then why is our industry struggling so much? Why do junior designers fail to grow into fully-fledged seniors? Nobody’s taught these younger designers to think like designers. To reason through problems. To wrestle with complexity the way experienced designers do. We blame “outside” forces like automation, shrinking budgets, and organizational shifts that prioritize speed. But I think we’re missing a systemic cause: we’ve dismantled the apprenticeship model from both ends.</p><h3>The Dismantling of Apprenticeship</h3><p>To understand how we got here, we need to look at design’s journey of professionalization. Design schools have existed since the 1870s — RISD, Pratt, Parsons — but they operated on apprenticeship principles. You learned in studios under master teachers. When you graduated, you joined design agencies and continued learning the same way: working alongside senior designers, watching how they solved problems, gradually taking on more responsibility. Through the 60s, 70s, and 80s, this was just how you learned the craft.</p><p>Then came the web. In the 2000s, digital design was still craft-heavy — we were people who made things look nice, who skinned websites. We wanted a seat at the table, to weigh in on decisions that impacted our work. So we embraced design thinking, user-centered design, and strategic frameworks. This was necessary. Software was getting complex, and design needed a voice beyond aesthetics. But we over-corrected.</p><figure><img alt=""Timeline showing decreasing apprenticeship with increasing “businessification” of design"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*WyRoQhES1XbHo_pO.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Learning through long-term apprenticeship with experts seems like a downward trend.</figcaption></figure><p>As Jenny Wen pointed out in her talk “Craft is Counter-Intuitive,” we tilted so far toward strategy that craft started to feel less important. Portfolios became filled with diagrams and journey maps, maybe one screen mockup. Design systems made our work modular and efficient, but also boring and predictable. We automated the artistry out of our own jobs. And when designers moved into leadership, they followed modern management principles — principles designed for business and tech, not craft-based disciplines. The advice was clear: stay strategic, don’t micromanage, empower through delegation. So design leaders withdrew from craft entirely. “Stay out of the work” became the hallmark of good management, even though design is a craft that requires apprenticeship.</p><p>At the same time, we industrialized design education. Bootcamps promised to turn people into designers in twelve weeks. They taught frameworks, processes, and deliverables — but they couldn’t teach the apprenticeship model because they didn’t have it themselves. Students went from bootcamp curricula to design systems, never experiencing what it’s like to jam with someone who’s been doing this for years.</p><h3>What Juniors Actually Need</h3><p>But we need to get back to a Victor Wooten approach. You don’t learn to speak by practicing alone until you’re fluent or reading in books. You don’t learn jazz by studying theory in isolation. You learn by doing it next to people who already know how. The “jamming” model creates a safe space to make mistakes. It puts you close to people who know what they’re doing, so you can watch how they think. You learn when to lead, when to follow, when to take risks. You see the quiet corners of practice, not just the outcome. You watch someone hit a dead end, figure out what’s not working, and iterate toward something better.</p><blockquote><em>You learn by doing it next to people who already know how.</em></blockquote><figure><img alt=""2x2 grid showing experience of peers and proximity to people"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*wTpkJU4a3xC_ykWd.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Make space for experienced individuals to be closer to the work.</figcaption></figure><p>This is what our industry desperately needs. This is what junior designers need. They need to jam with people who’ve been doing this for years. They need to see how you think through design problems, watch you work through solutions in real time, and feel the difference between an acceptable solution and a great one. You can’t learn this from tutorials or design system documentation or other junior designers. That’s like babies only talking to other babies. Yet this is exactly where we’ve left them.</p><h3>What Jamming Looks Like in Practice</h3><p>Jenny Wen, Design Lead at Anthropic and former Director of Design at Figma, shows what the third way looks like. In <a href=""https://designx.community/talks/jenny-wen-(design-lead-anthropic)-craft-is-counter-intuitive"">her talk</a>, she challenges the “stay out of the work” rule directly. She notes that craft-focused companies are increasingly looking for leaders who are hands-on, who can help teams do great work, who can get into the details and push their teams to be better. Her critical insight: “If your team is already really great at craft or already really senior, you believe that you can make them even better at it. I think that’s the most empowering thing you can give your team.”</p><figure><img alt=""Venn diagram with three overlapping cirlces: trust, autonomy, expertise. In the middle of the three overlaps: “jam”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*HBaZBH9wnhwQHFdu.jpeg"" /><figcaption>With the right ingredients, jamming can be a powerful growth tool.</figcaption></figure><p>What does she actually do?</p><ul><li><strong>Pairs directly with designers</strong> on challenging work. When the Figma Slides product icon had too many stakeholders and too many opinions, she sat down with the designer and they pushed pixels together to arrive at the final design. Then she helped defend that decision.</li><li><strong>Gives detailed design feedback</strong>, not just about strategy and problems, but about border radius and hierarchy, because these details matter to support the overarching strategy.</li><li><strong>Riffs on designs</strong>, hopping into files and creating her own versions, making it clear to her team that these are explorations, not directives. They don’t have to choose her option.</li><li><strong>Concepts work herself</strong> to help drive direction and push teams to be more ambitious. When she’s managing, she’s rarely designing, but when it would help, she doesn’t hold back.</li></ul><p>The foundation of all of this is trust. Everything she does comes from “a place of trust,” as she puts it. Decisions still belong to the designer. She’s helping as a teammate, not asserting authority. This is jamming: working together on craft, showing how you think instead of dictating what to do. You’re getting close without taking over. You’re hands-on without controlling. That’s the distinction we missed.</p><blockquote><em>You’re getting close without taking over. You’re hands-on without controlling.</em></blockquote><p>I’ve been doing exactly what Jenny describes for years. Pairing with designers, pushing pixels together, giving detailed craft feedback. But I did it quietly, almost like I was breaking the rules, because I knew as a manager “I wasn’t supposed to.” I’d tell myself I was just “helping out” rather than admitting what it really was — teaching. Jenny’s talk was freeing. It gave me permission to stop apologizing for being hands-on with craft.</p><p>This shift is already happening whether you choose it or not. Organizations are flattening, and managers are being asked to be more hands-on. The tools our teams use are more powerful than ever, and the software people love is increasingly defined by its craft. Design needs different leadership now.</p><h3>What This Requires of You</h3><p>This requires some nuance. Not all leaders need design backgrounds; team composition often needs other skills. And this isn’t about doing all the craft yourself or dictating solutions. It’s about being intentional and careful about when you jump in. Know when your presence helps and when it gets in the way. You need to recognize the difference between helping and controlling. Build trust so your team knows what you’re doing. Be vulnerable enough to show your dead ends, not just your successes. Wooten’s “no wrong notes” philosophy doesn’t mean there are no standards. You’re creating safety to learn and explore, not accepting mediocrity.</p><p>Empower people by working close to them, not by staying out. Treat craft like part of your job is teaching, not just something you personally like. Recognize that hands-on with trust is jamming, not micromanagement.</p><figure><img alt=""Drawing of a calendar with “jam” blocks scheduled on it."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*RiESiCDBwmb7eTi3.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Prioritize this kind of time on your calendar!</figcaption></figure><h3>How to Start Jamming with Your Team</h3><p>Practically, this looks different for every team:</p><ul><li>Protect time for pairing sessions: maybe Friday afternoons are sacred for working through hard problems together</li><li>Give feedback on the details that matter: border radius, hierarchy, type scale, not just strategy and flows</li><li>Riff on designs in shared files the way Jenny does: make it clear these are options to explore, not mandates to follow</li><li>Model your thinking process, including the dead ends, not just the polished solutions</li></ul><p>What ever you do, just remember: you’re creating opportunities to jam.</p><h3>The Jam Session Is Waiting</h3><p>If you’re a design leader, I want to encourage you to get back in the room. Your team needs to jam with you. If you’re hiring design leaders, look for people who can make the work better, not just manage the process. If you’re a junior designer, get close to people who know what they’re doing. Find your jam session. That’s where the learning happens.</p><p>Babies don’t wait until they’re fluent to speak with adults. Musicians don’t wait until they’re perfect to play with the band. Designers shouldn’t have to wait until they’re senior to work alongside masters. The jam session is where learning happens, and your team is waiting for you to show up.</p><figure><img alt=""Let’s get jammin’.

Generating content for design mocks or writing simple scripts to automate boring tasks. I even built a Figma plugin to easily rename all the icons in our icon library, to avoid the repetitive work, but also because I was curious if I could make it work.</p><p>One thing led to another. I started playing around and started finding excuses to explore. I built an iOS app to keep track of daily exercise, started playing with V0 and Lovable to quickly brainstorm and generate rough design directions.</p><p>Then the play started to become serious, when I took a stab at shipping real production PRs into the Shopify admin, and even more serious after I joined the Sidekick team.</p><p>I wasn’t forced. I didn’t plan it. It was just inevitable.</p><p>When you get a sharp knife, you don’t keep cutting with the blunt one.<br />But somewhere along the way, I started noticing that this knife could slip.</p><h3>From wandering to answers</h3><p>Early on I changed how I approach research online. I stopped defaulting to Google search and started relying more on Perplexity, and other similar tools.</p><p>On paper, it’s an obvious upgrade. Direct answers, cleaner summaries, fewer tabs open, and much less noise. But something subtle disappeared in the process.</p><p>No more random blog posts from 2010, fewer half-relevant Reddit rabbit holes. Almost nothing that pulled me somewhere unexpected.</p><p>I stopped wandering, I started extracting.</p><p>Super efficient, but over time, that efficiency started to shape how I thought. I was moving faster towards answers, but along narrower paths. Ideas felt more predictable, and I was less surprised by where I ended up. The work converged quickly, sometimes too quickly.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of several people walking in the same direction with zombie-like posture, while one person in the middle shrugs and looks confused."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GxRLUzumiwbRWV9DHeQEKA.png"" /></figure><blockquote>Design almost never benefits from straight lines. Some ideas only show up when you take the long way around, when you don’t quite know what you’re looking for yet. When there’s room for detours, dead ends, side-quests, and a bit of adventure.</blockquote><p>That’s when I started noticing how much the tools were quietly changing where my attention went.</p><h3>When speed feels like understanding</h3><p>The popular narrative is that AI makes people ten times faster. That’s not false, but it’s missing something important.</p><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/7-tips-to-design-faster-ae01c6fa71f2"">Speed always mattered in design</a>, because it enables you to explore more options, learn sooner, and iterate your ways towards something better. Which is super valuable when you know what you’re aiming for.</p><p>What changed with AI wasn’t that reality, it’s the fact that now I can do things that I wouldn’t have attempted at all.</p><p>It’s not just making me explore more ideas faster, prototype thoughts sooner. It’s also giving the capability to touch code areas that I used to treat as off-limits, to ship production PRs. Crossing boundaries that previously felt like someone else’s job.</p><p>This shift is real, and it’s empowering.</p><p>But there’s a catch, when something becomes easy or possible, it can feel understood. The act of doing replaces the work of learning. I could change things confidently, quickly, and convincingly, and in the process mistake that fluency for comprehension.</p><p>This is where the delusion creeps in. AI makes you believe you’re quickly unlocking new capabilities before you actually earn the right to do so. You believe that because you can change something easily, you understand it.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a person diving underwater with a flashlight, illuminating a large iceberg hidden beneath the surface."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*q22c40M7zQHC7IQHRQci6w.png"" /></figure><p>That confusion between ease and understanding showed up for me very concretely when I started shipping production code. I tried to start small, a spacing fix. Something contained, just visual polish. Turns out to be one of the hardest things I could have picked, according to an engineer that reviewed my PR.</p><p>The spacing issue wasn’t local, it was the result of deeper inconsistencies across shared components. I only understood that after that very patient engineer walked me through the system and its dependencies.</p><p>Shipping production software inside a large organization still has gravity. There are stakeholder, reviews, guardrails, dependencies, and real consequences. No amount of prompting turns that into a free-for-all, and that’s a good thing.</p><p>Ultimatly, after properly understanding the problem we didn’t just fix the symptom, we fixed the core problem. But when I asked Claude (in Cursor) to fix the issue, it did. Quickly and bluntly. It ignored system constraints, because it didn’t know they existed, and I didn’t know any better.</p><p>Confidence without context is a delusion. Being able to make something with AI isn’t the same as understanding what you’re making.</p><h3>When the tool sets the direction</h3><p>Most conversations about AI in design drift quickly toward how people are using it. One-shot prompts, workflows, tool stacks, prototype hacks. The tool becomes the story.</p><p>“How did you make this?” quietly replaces a more important question: “What were you trying to accomplish, and why?”</p><p>That shift matters, because when the <em>how</em> comes too early, it starts shaping the outcome. You optimize for what the tool is good at, and adjust the problem to fit the workflow.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a hand lifting a person like a chess piece above a chessboard while the person holds another chess piece."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FNnATLGJ0-9VcRbDRaVD2w.png"" /></figure><p>The demos look technically impressive and you get results quickly.

It comes from intent.</p><p>When the <em>how</em> leads, quality follows the path with least resistance, not necessarily the one worth taking.</p><p>Earlier this year I was tasked to create an illustration style with AI.<br />I explored several directions that were heavily shaped by AI’s strengths and limitations at the time. The results were interesting, and I would go as far as saying a couple directions were an improvement over what we had, but they didn’t stand on their own.</p><p>The direction couldn’t convincingly last over time, and even though we got really close to shipping it, a key stakeholder put a pause in the project, and rightfully so.</p><p>That failure wasn’t because AI was bad at illustration, it was because I let the tool define directions before an idea had earned its shape. Also the fact that it as an AI generated style started to matter more than whether the actual direction.</p><p>The problem wasn’t usefulness, it was timing.</p><p>I feel this a lot when I try to prototype genuinely new ideas with AI.</p><p>I start refining prompts, then refining the prompt that refines the prompt. I sketch something in Figma, just to explain what I mean. Suddenly, I’m no longer exploring the problem space, I’m negotiating with a probabilistic system.</p><p>The focus shifts. I’m not designing the idea anymore, I’m designing for the tool.</p><h3>What gets pushed aside</h3><p>AI trains impatience. When it doesn’t get things right fast enough, I feel friction. And that friction shows up precisely where slowness actually matters.</p><p>A pencil and paper, or a blank Figma canvas, let me dump ideas out of my head without having to explain myself. I can contradict myself, I can be sloppy, I can discover the problem while working on it.</p><p>AI demands certainty much earlier, it struggles when the input is fuzzy, novel or still forming. When constraints need to bend and evolve, instead of locking everything too soon.</p><p>Those are exactly the moments where design needs space to reflect, not quick answers. Design starts with ambiguity, not clarity. With ideas that are still fragile and half-formed. With thoughts that don’t quite line up yet.</p><p>Designers need time to wonder.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a person lying across the hands of a large clock, staring upward as time passes."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Bx2OxnNRZvHWWichuwj4nQ.png"" /></figure><p>Time to poke ideas without knowing where they’ll land. Time to follow threads that might go somewhere. Time to sit with something unresolved long enough for it to surprise you.</p><p>That space used to exist more naturally, now it’s getting compressed.</p><p>When answers arrive too early, they create a sense of progress, but lack depth. You move forward, but not inwards. You lock in the first thing that makes sense, because it arrived quickly.</p><p>Reflection doesn’t vanish on its own, it gets pushed aside. If you don’t protect it, it doesn’t survive.</p><h3>Judgement is the real multiplier</h3><p>The same tools in the hands of different designers don’t produce similar results. They amplify what’s already there.<br />You don’t get taste, judgement, context, and design sensitivity for free.</p><p>AI doesn’t level the field, it widens the gap.<br />Because it doesn’t replace judgement, it leans on it.</p><p>A weak designer doesn’t suddenly produce great work with better tools. They just produce mediocre work faster. A strong designer uses the same tools very differently. They explore more directions, but they also discard aggressively. They recognize what’s obvious and push past it.</p><p>The tool augments you, not design in the abstract. So what you bring to the table as a designer actually matters even more now.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a person blowing bubbles shaped like light bulbs, floating in the air."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zicX1MIaCzEIaSTahJfYIA.png"" /></figure><p>I felt this clearly while preparing a workshop earlier this year. I started by dumping everything out of my head. Ideas, doubts, half-formed thoughts. Only after that I used ChatGPT to explore formats, exercises, and ways to structure my sessions.</p><p>It was incredibly helpful, and a speed boost. But only because I already had a sense of direction. I still had to decide what to keep, what to ignore, and what actually felt like me, because ultimately I need to feel comfortable standing in front of people and own it.</p><p>I’ve noticed this pattern repeat. Once something exists, like a sketch or rough idea, AI can be a helpful partner to expand your options, challenge assumptions, and suggest variations.</p><p>It’s great at reacting to something concrete, but doesn’t do it pro-actively.<br />AI is not curious, it’s optimized to continue your thoughts, not to come up with new ones. So if you use it as a starting point, that’s where you dilute your intent.</p><h3>What gets lost when everything feels like magic</h3><p>I’m happy to hand off repetitive busy work to AI. The kind of effort that burns time without building judgement. Removing that toils is a real win, especially because it clears space.</p><p>But some struggles are worth keeping.</p><p>AI is extremely good at multiplying output, but learning doesn’t compound just because you did more things. It compounds when you compare, discard, and understand why one direction is better than another.</p><p>Iterating through bad ideas. Refining a design until it finally feels right. Figuring out how to explain your thinking to other people. Being wrong and having to course-correct. Sitting with uncertainty longer than is comfortable. These moments may not look efficient, but they are formative. That’s where taste comes from.</p><p>Without these loops, experience doesn’t compound. It flattens.<br />It’s like trying to learn how to draw by tracing pictures. You’re going to get a decent result faster, but you’re not actually learning.</p><p>A lot of people talk about design replacing juniors, and paint a world where a single super senior designer, with the right tools, can do everything. Strategy, exploration, execution, polish. Basically, they’re the maestro, and they play all the instruments. That’s a lot to carry alone.</p><p>What this misses, is the fact that junior designers aren’t a tool. <br />They don’t just execute. They question decisions and propose alternatives. They bring a unique perspective, sometimes naive, that makes the work better. They’re not invested in obeying and pleasing you, and just doing what they’re told.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a person sitting on one end of a seesaw while a laptop falls onto the opposite end."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8T_3airHWTgAift2j5361A.png"" /></figure><p>When AI is your only partner, the expectation flips. It’s all on you.</p><p>Even if you’re lucky to have colleagues around, you’ll notice that most feedback changes when people aren’t actively working on the same problem. You get reactions instead of debate. Validation instead of pushback.</p><p>Creativity gets quieter, more internal.</p><p>Human friction still matters. Not just for the sake of quality and innovation, but to keep you from fooling yourself.</p><h3>Design matters more now</h3><p>Design doesn’t disappear because systems can generate things. If nothing else, designers still have to shape these system’s interactions, mental models, build trust and failure modes.</p><p>The chat interface is the beginning, not the end. They’re a convenient starting point, but not a natural destination. We’re already seeing that evolution is starting to happen with tools like Cursor introducing mixing conversation with direct manipulation. That feels like an early signal, not a finished answer.</p><p>Working on Sidekick has made especially clear to me how young and rudimentar these tools still are. A lot of their behaviour is still evolving, and the potential is immense.</p><p>Recently, I worked on our app-generation baseline prompt and design guidance, where I had to decide what the model should optimize for, and just as importantly, what it should avoid.</p><p>This kind of work doesn’t look like traditional feature design. It’s closer to shaping behaviour, explaining intent, providing examples, anticipating needs and misuse. Designing guardrails without locking everything down… sounds a lot like design systems, doesn’t it?</p><p>The difference now, is that we have a real opportunity to make these tools feel more human. To meet people where they are, instead of forcing everyone through a single predefined flow, or pre-baked set of components.</p><p>Interfaces don’t have to be static anymore, they can adapt to context, intent, and experience. But that space needs to be thoroughly explored.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a person climbing stairs while carrying an oversized pencil, which is being used to draw the steps."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rwFNspeNLcFGHajwxrf55Q.png"" /></figure><p>It needs design. It needs designers to wander, to tinker, and more importanly, to have fun.</p><h3>Where the cut happens</h3><p>None of what I said above means AI doesn’t belong in early design.</p><p>AI has meaningfully changed how I work. It helps me explore directions faster, summarize large contexts, bridge into code, and offload repetitive work so I can spend energy where it actually matters.</p><p>What’s important is not what AI can do, it’s what I do with it.<br />Used too early, it collapses uncertainty before ideas have earned their shape. User a bit later, it becomes a powerful partner, reacting to intent instead of defining it.</p><p>This isn’t a question of AI’s capability, it’s a question of YOUR capability and timing.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a person cutting into a thought cloud with a knife."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LwqhobBWnLhLn6zN-xUOSg.png"" /></figure><p>This reminds me of the first Japanese chef’s knife I ever bought.<br />It looked beautiful. Perfect balance and incredibly sharp. It cut through almost everything with no effort… including me.</p><p>One of the first things I did with it was slice my hand. The knife went through my skin with no resistance. I still have the scar.</p><p>The knife wasn’t the problem, it was doing exactly what it was designed to do. I just wasn’t ready to handle it.</p><p>AI feels powerful, easy to use, and only getting sharper. If you’re not careful, it lets you move so fast that you skip the moments where attention and judgment matter most.</p><p>So the question isn’t if AI is sharp enough for you to use it. <br />The real question is whether you’re paying enough attention to where and when you’re cutting.</p><p><em>Thanks for reading! <br />If you feel like connecting, I’m on </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/halfool/""><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em>, </em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/halfool_draws/""><em>Instagram</em></a>,<em> and </em><a href=""https://x.com/halfool_draws""><em>X</em></a><em>.</em></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=b1014292335d"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/a-sharp-tool-can-still-ruin-the-cut-b1014292335d"">A sharp tool can still ruin the cut</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>and why I’ve been making Bob Dylan songs about Sonic the Hedgehog</h4><figure><img alt=""Cat holding various objects from phones to tarot cards infront of 2025 text"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RHYn-0zB5LzBS1VLBCE8og.jpeg"" /><figcaption><em>End of 2025 Reflections. illustration by author.</em></figcaption></figure><p>In 2025, AI stopped feeling like just a tool to me and started to feel more like a mirror.</p><p>This thought really struck me while generating music with Suno AI. Through the process of creating, I was channelling my raw emotion, emotions I hadn’t realised I was even dealing with at the time. Is this how musicians feel when writing songs?</p><p>This AI tool, like so many I’ve used this year, did not help reflect just my productivity, but also showed me my intentions, my taste, and sometimes even my nostalgia. In a way, the songs I was generating were more truthful about what was happening in my life than I was willing to admit.</p><p>Hell, I was producing so many songs at one point that they started subtly referencing one another with a lyric here and there, creating my own mini music universe. I made a <a href=""https://suno.com/s/Cw2XE2hMNCJTavEU"">Bob Dylan-style narrative about Sonic from the comic,</a> weaving in philosophical concepts. I remixed <a href=""https://suno.com/s/nyXDFnMujFIS8dzB"">If You’re Strong You Can Fly from Sonic CD</a>. I turned classic poems into music: <a href=""https://suno.com/s/dJAscTp2gfe8kajG"">The Tyger</a> and <a href=""https://suno.com/s/LQrLMIHXyKzNXpU6"">The Raven</a>.</p><p>I appreciate these experiments because they prompt me to critically examine whether AI-generated artefacts are inherently more detached from us as creators. Because this raises important questions about the nature of ownership in collaborative creation with AI. While it is possible to use AI while still maintaining ownership of the resulting ideas, this requires one’s ability to articulate, defend, and integrate them into one’s own conceptual framework. Ultimately, if we fail to maintain active engagement with the creative process and merely delegate tasks to AI without reflection, there is a risk that delegation becomes abdication of responsibility and authorship.</p><h3>Where we’re heading</h3><p>I think we’re at an inflexion point for product management and knowledge work more broadly. The tools we have now enable us to operate at a scale and speed that was unimaginable even two years ago. But that acceleration comes with a cost: we’re less practised at the slow, deliberate thinking that leads to insight.</p><p>In the field of product management, I have long suspected that the future belongs to generalists, and I’ve never been more sure of that. Those who can think and do, who understand engineering, data science, UX, marketing, and sales deeply enough to prototype, test models, run discovery, and build strategies that excite teams will be the most successful. The single-domain specialist is increasingly a relic.</p><p>The most important thing we can do is maintain our attention, take accountability for our actions and deliverables, and resist the weaponisation of our curiosity. That’s the work ahead.</p><h3>From tarot to moon ceremonies</h3><figure><img alt=""Author Hanging out at Avebury Hedge for the Sprint Equinox"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jPY3cB6x5G9oBqfCN1Dxeg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Hanging out at Avebury Hedge for the Sprint Equinox</figcaption></figure><p>Last year, I joked about using tarot cards for sprint planning. This year, I’ve built on that theme. 2025 was the year I got introduced to moon ceremonies and magic stones. I understand many will read that and think I’ve gone potty, but hear me out.</p><p>Like tarot, I don’t really believe these things have any inherent power, but they are useful for reflection by forcing you to recognise where you are right now and set an intention. But what’s surprised me: these silly ceremonies are very engaging. Friends, family, even colleagues: people WANT to be involved in the silly gathering. Curiosity, novelty, disgust, whatever it is, it’s just fun. There is something about putting people in a scenario where we can all share in the collective chaos of the universe and support each other through whatever insights we find. Friendship is not natural. It needs work because to be human is to be an animal that needs witnesses.</p><p>Anyway, those are just the highlights. Below are more reflections that gave me pause this year. Dive in, and I hope they inspire and invoke thoughts that set you up for a great 2026.</p><h3>The Reflections</h3><h4><strong>On debate and changing minds:</strong></h4><ol><li><strong>The best way to resolve a conflict or debate is to make the argument of your opponent better than they could.</strong> You literally have to make a better version of their argument, state it back to them, then ask, “Did I miss anything?” That clarity of understanding is the foundation for any possible change of mind for all parties involved, including ourselves.</li><li><strong>Changing somebody’s mind is one of the hardest things to achieve, and aggressive approaches tend to backfire.</strong> There is one thing that works, though: show curiosity. Be interested in what they are saying and try to understand why they think that way. This will provoke a considerably more open-minded response from others. Curiosity: the same thing social media weaponises against us, but when genuinely deployed in conversation, becomes one of our most powerful tools for connection.</li><li><strong>When debating, people tend to prefer the position of those who don’t really hold one of their own.</strong> LLMs are perfect for this and thus a great tool for finding common ground.</li></ol><h4><strong>On AI and tools:</strong></h4><ol><li><strong>The most important thing, I think, that most people in knowledge work should be doing is learning to vibe code.</strong> Vibe code anything: a diary, a picture book for your mum, a fan page for your local farm. Anything. It’s not about learning to code, but rather appreciating how much more we could do with machines than before. This is what I mean about the generalist product manager: being able to prototype, test, and build without being held back by technical constraints. I was able to relaunch <a href=""https://adrianraudaschl.com"">my website</a> in a fraction of the time it took me years ago, adding interactive effects and custom graphics that would have taken weeks before. I could finally create a website that feels like me: not only a record of things I’ve done, but also a place for experiments like a mini social media feed, all without the long nights solving silly problems like deploy configs.</li><li><strong>Learn to work creatively with LLMs in this order of importance: combinational, exploratory, and novel.</strong></li><li><strong>If you let AI do all the writing and planning without understanding the thinking behind it, you’ll lose connection to the outcome.</strong> The key is maintaining ownership: can you defend the ideas, explain the reasoning, and adapt the direction mid-process? If yes, you’re using the tool. If not, the tool is using you. Like I said at the start: the danger is delegation turning into abdication.</li><li><strong>When working without AI, teams outperformed individuals by a significant amount, and teams working with AI outperformed everything else.</strong> (<a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5188231"">Research source</a>)</li></ol><h4><strong>On leadership and politics:</strong></h4><ol><li><strong>Aligning the goals of many people begins with understanding what a good outcome looks like for each of them.</strong> This was my biggest learning from bringing together groups with very different approaches to product development.</li><li><strong>Paranoia grows with success.</strong> I suspect that’s natural, as you have more to lose, and now you are exposed to far more signals. Keep an eye on it and always be prepared to lose something with the hope of gaining more in return.</li><li><strong>You need to learn to love politics, and you also need to understand that politics gets more childish the higher you go up in the organisation.</strong></li><li><strong>Sometimes you need to just call out the mood in the room.</strong> That we have gone off track, that there is tension, that we need to take a moment to step back. To do this well, ask a question rather than declare it: “Are we still aligned on our goals here?” invites reflection better than “We’ve lost sight of our goals.”</li></ol><h4><strong>On building and creating:</strong></h4><ol><li><strong>Don’t build a prototype with the goal of making a solution. Prototypes are best used as questions, not answers.</strong></li><li><strong>Thoughtless thinking is a state we should all strive for.</strong> Henrik Karlsson’s “<a href=""https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/wordless-thought"">When Is It Better to Think Without Words?</a>” explores this beautifully: how our most profound thinking often happens in a pre-verbal state, before we’ve forced our thoughts into the constraints of language. This is the slow, deliberate thinking I mentioned earlier: the kind that gets harder to access as our tools get faster.</li><li><strong>Three intelligences: human, artificial, and community.</strong></li><li><strong>To do the most important things, you have to say no a lot and disappoint many people, even without a complete plan, even without fully understanding why, in the hope that the space created will be filled with something more valuable.</strong></li><li><strong>So much of what is worth doing requires an almost irrational commitment to pushing through pain that would break most people.</strong></li><li><strong>You win either by climbing the mountain ahead of you or building one beneath you.</strong></li><li><strong>A great work emerges from an invisible ecology of lesser works.</strong></li><li><strong>Sometimes you just need to build a faster horse.</strong> There ain’t no shame in admitting that. Spotify was just the faster horse in a world of iTunes.</li></ol><h4><strong>On life and perspective:</strong></h4><ol><li><strong>Experience is what you get when you don’t get what you want.</strong></li><li><strong>Strengths and weaknesses are often two sides of the same coin.</strong></li><li><strong>The older I get, the more I realise there aren’t a lot of people who are stupid, but there are allot of people who are incurious.</strong> In many ways, I can’t blame them. Social media continually weaponises our curiosity against us.</li></ol><h4><strong>On friendship:</strong></h4><ol><li><strong>When having a party, invite a few close friends to come 30–60 minutes early to set up and hang out with you.</strong> Those moments before everyone arrives, when you’re just arranging chairs and testing the speaker system, are often more valuable than the party itself. Uri’s “<a href=""https://www.atvbt.com/21-facts-about-throwing-good-parties/"">21 Facts About Throwing Good Parties</a>” captures this wisdom: parties succeed not through perfect execution but through creating the conditions for genuine connection. Like the moon ceremonies and tarot, it’s about creating space for people to witness each other.</li><li><strong>We are biologically wired to return favours, even unearned ones.</strong> This works both ways: be mindful of what you accept and what you give.</li></ol><h4><strong>In the future:</strong></h4><ol><li><strong>Image generation models have reached a tipping point this year.</strong> The most recent models can perform amazing style transfer and contextual image transformations, and they can now reliably produce text with context. I foresee an explosion in visual learning aids and exploration next year. When designing Christmas cards this year or a t-shirt design for LeapSpace, I could layer so much more information: aggregating all my experiences from the year into a symbol-rich card, or blending the most important scientific discoveries with my love of 2001: A Space Odyssey and our product logo. It’s not just about generating images anymore; it’s about encoding meaning and narrative visually. The same way I encoded narrative into those Sonic songs: remixing what you love through your own lens.</li><li><strong>I’ve started getting more sophisticated with using AI in different work environments.</strong> Using IDEs like Cursor, I’ve set up folders of documents with custom instructions on how to interact with and retrieve them to help make informed decisions, answer questions, or continue building my knowledge base. It’s still early, but I really like this idea of the working directory knowledge base that grows with you and is managed by AI.</li><li><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15168""><strong>World models</strong></a> look super interesting. For those unfamiliar, world models are AI systems that build internal representations of their environment, allowing them to predict outcomes and reason about their surroundings. Recent research argues they should develop structured, adaptive representations similar to how young children intuitively learn about the world. Google DeepMind’s <a href=""https://deepmind.google/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models/"">Genie 3</a> even has this awesome visual and interactive version, generating dynamic, navigable worlds at 24 fps with real-time interaction. I can imagine that when they get more consistent, do text really well, are easily promptable and can do style transfer and brand consistency, they’ll be incredible for games and entertainment.</li><li><strong>What hits me is this idea of having simulated environments for our best ideas.</strong> It doesn’t have to be a high-fidelity environment necessarily, but one with a set of parameters that can be controlled, understood, and evolve. I often think of the Creature pets from Lionhead’s Black and White game from the 2000s: this was, at the time, state-of-the-art AI in a game of all things! Your behaviour towards the creature, if you treated it nicely or poorly, would directly impact its behaviour and personality towards itself, your villagers and the world around it. This was all part of a more complex system for the creatures, which was also influenced by other factors, such as the skills they were taught, the food they ate, and the events that shaped their lives. All of it, effectively, a bunch of parameters that the game would adjust based on your actions. Treat your creature poorly, punish it in confusing ways and not feed it, over time it will become sickly and cowardly. I often think about this and how modelling a system like that could be a template for working with increasingly complex AIs. That, rather than prompting with instructions and context, we were to give it personality traits and, in addition to collecting memories, adjust those parameters to provide context over time. It’s a different way of thinking about AI interaction: not as tool use, but as relationship building.</li></ol><h4><strong>Travel and discoveries:</strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Hot spring waterfalls in Beitou, Taipei"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WFbYDSI6G74uX-7pXb5aHQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Hot spring waterfalls in Beitou, Taipei</figcaption></figure><ol><li><strong>After seeing one of my favourite shirts ruined on a sweaty 12-hour flight to Tokyo, I discovered Muji’s undershirts.</strong> Now essential for both comfort and confidence (no under arm stains for me), and keeping my nicest shirts safe! Means slightly less washing too: top tip.</li><li><strong>The two-phone travel strategy for China: carry one phone for all the Chinese apps and a second to translate the screen of your primary phone.</strong> Chinese apps are built with a completely opposite philosophy to the West’s simplicity, dense with options and configurations. But what struck me most was the gamification of everything. From the potential to win a free Luckin Coffee to getting a random discount on your subway fare. It’s so alien and different, as if you’re encouraged to participate in the economy with the hope of winning. Every transaction becomes a tiny lottery. Fascinating from a design perspective, maddening from a user one.</li><li><strong>If you love hot springs, you need to visit Beitou in Taipei.</strong> Most people never visit Taiwan, but if you’re a hot spring lover, this place is absolutely worth the trip.</li><li><strong>A country can be in economic decline, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it can’t be graceful.</strong> Japan is a master at this.</li><li><strong>Comics over anime.</strong> I got really tired of watching most things and found myself returning to source material: One Punch Man, Dragon Ball, Death Note, BLAME!, and The Invincible. The <a href=""https://stctp.zone/"">Sonic the Comic podcast</a> was a surprisingly detailed hit of nostalgia. Same Sonic that inspired those AI-generated songs I mentioned: everything connects back to what we loved first.</li><li><strong>The Trimui Brick Hammer became my new favourite toy this year.</strong> A retro gaming handheld that plays SNES, GBA, PS1, even some Dreamcast and N64 games, all in a compact metal body that feels far more premium than its cost. Perfect for train commutes, flights, and, more importantly, for disconnecting from my phone for all my entertainment. I even installed a custom OS on it, so it’s also now my iPod.</li><li><strong>The Bellroy Venture Ready Pack 26L has become the greatest bag I’ve ever had.</strong> Sometimes you just find that perfect piece of gear that fits exactly how you move through the world.</li><li><strong>The new iPhone earned its place for two reasons: the orange colour (finally, some personality in tech) and insane all-day battery life.</strong></li></ol><h4><strong>On health and awareness:</strong></h4><ol><li><strong>At the start of the year, I was plagued by sickness until February.</strong> It was just a really bad cold/virus, but it encouraged me to finally get some blood tests done as a checklist. I saw a few things I didn’t like, but especially concerning low vitamin D and calcium levels. That event finally encouraged me to optimise my nutrition. Ten months later, an updated blood test shows me things are going in the right direction, and I feel really good.</li><li><strong>The Oura ring helped me get a handle on how stressed I am at any given time.</strong> I started strong with silent retreats and meditation, but didn’t keep that up. However, just recognising the stress has been useful. Attention to what’s happening in your own body is as important as attention to your work.</li><li><strong>Using foam rollers has brought me so much back relief after months of desk work.</strong></li><li>The Ordinary’s balancing and clarifying serum completely transformed my skincare routine.

<h3>A UX carol</h3><h4>It was Christmas Eve, 2025, and like any other day, Ulysses Xavier was doom-scrolling LinkedIn.</h4><figure><img alt=""Stylized illustration titled “The Ghost of UX Past”: a nostalgic attic scene where a modern young man with a smartphone stands beside a seated person using an old desktop computer. A ghostly figure holding a book labeled “HTML” points at the retro screen displaying a hit counter for a website."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*nrlgpOj8kMplYupM.png"" /></figure><p>It was Christmas Eve, 2025, and like any other day, Ulysses Xavier was doom-scrolling LinkedIn.</p><p>Ulysses was a UX designer — or a “Product Designer,” or maybe a “Digital Experience Architect,” or a “Product Experience Manager,” depending on which day you asked him. Currently, however, he felt more like a Figma monkey. He sat in his Scandinavian designer chair, bathed in the orangey light of a dual-monitor setup (because you gotta filter out that blue light), reading yet another hot take about how AI had rendered his so-called career — which was kind of a joke, anyway — obsolete.</p><p>“Bah,” Ulysses muttered, quickly archiving yet another generic rejection email from a job application. “Humbug.”</p><p>He closed his eyes, wishing for the good old times when designers did all the user research and customer journeys by themselves. When he opened them, his MacBook and monitors were gone and his Spotify playlist “Coffee Shop Background Noises” replaced by the screeching, static-filled sound of a 28.8k modem connecting to the internet.</p><h3>The First of the Three Spirits</h3><p>Standing before him was an ethereal, slightly translucent figure dressed in flannel and holding a copy of <em>HTML for Dummies</em>.</p><p>“I am the Ghost of UX Past,” the figure said, its voice crackling like a 32-kbps RealAudio. “Come with me.”</p><p>Suddenly, Ulysses was back in 1995. He saw an attic. A solitary figure sat hunched over a CRT monitor, coding in what looked like a very old-school Apple Notes, typing on a keyboard that seemed way too clunky and loud.</p><p>“Is that ... a developer?” Ulysses asked.</p><p>“No,” the Ghost corrected. “That is Max. He’s what’s called a webmaster. In this era, there are no silos. He designs the page, writes the HTML, configures the server, and crops the JPEGs in Photoshop. He’s like a general contractor of the web.”​¹</p><p>Ulysses watched Max struggle. He was using invisible tables for layout because CSS didn’t really exist yet.² He was embedding headers as images because there were only a handful of fonts like Times New Roman and Courier available.³ It looked like a horrible mess … and painful.​</p><p>“It looks terrible,” Ulysses whispered, eyeing a blinking hit counter.</p><p>“It’s <em>foundational</em>,” the Ghost retorted. “There is nothing like ‘user experience’ yet — Don Norman has only started coining the term at Apple recently.⁴ But look at the ownership. Look at the freedom. There are no stakeholders blocking tickets. There’s just the creator and the user. It’s chaotic, yes. But it’s pure creative problem solving … well, maybe more creative than solving, to be fair.”​</p><p>“What is he using?” Ulysses asked. The ghost put a hand on his shoulder: “It’s called Notepad.”</p><p>Ulysses realized something. The constraints of the past — the technical limits, the lack of tools — forced immense creativity, even if the pages often seemed ugly. But these people weren’t just pushing (ugly) pixels; they were actually wrestling a giant squid.​</p><h3>The Second of the Three Spirits</h3><p>The scene dissolved into a sterile, open-plan office. Ulysses was sitting at a desk that looked like it rather belonged in a hospital. He noticed that on his monitor, there was a Zoom call with 45 participants.</p><p>“Am I … in a Zoom call … in an office? Why?”</p><p>“That’s the exact question I ask myself everyday … I’m the Ghost of UX Present, by the way,” sighed a weary figure who had appeared at his side, wearing a hoodie and looking noticeably burned out.</p><p>Ulysses looked around in confusion. He saw hundreds of designers churning out high-fidelity mockups in Figma, moving pixels by 4px increments. He saw their anxiety as Slack channels quickly filled with requests from stakeholders and management.</p><p>A couple of desks down, one of the designers was just laid off by his manager, “because revenue is bad and we have AI now to save costs.”</p><p>“Look at them,” the Ghost gestured. “They are terrified.”</p><p>Where the Ghost had gestured, Ulysses now saw analytics dashboards floating in the air like holographic projections. He couldn’t identify all the numbers<a href=""https://2008.maxspeicher.com/2022/09/26/steal-this-blog-post/"">,</a> because they seemed to be using Liquid Glass, but he saw the more than 250,000 tech layoffs from 2023.⁵ He saw the job market flooded with bootcamp graduates who had been promised secure and high-paying UX jobs.​⁶</p><p>“They feel like assembly line workers,” Ulysses said, recognizing the feeling. “Figma monkeys.”⁷</p><p>“Precisely,” the Ghost nodded. “They see product managers doing user research and creating wireframes. They see AI generating layouts faster than they can think. They are fighting for a seat at the table, but once they get there, they just take orders.”​⁸</p><p>The Ghost showed him a designer arguing with a stakeholder. The designer wanted to do discovery research; the stakeholder just wanted the screens done by Friday.</p><p>“We have become obsessed with the <em>artifacts</em> of design,” the Ghost said sadly. “Screens. Flows. Wireframes. We forgot that our job isn’t to make files. It’s to ensure the product works for the user. And because we act like factory workers, we are surprised when business treats us like a cost center to be optimized.”​</p><p>Ulysses felt a pit in his stomach. “Is this it? Is this how it ends? Replaced by AI, apathy, and alienation?”</p><h3>The Last of the Spirits</h3><p>The Zoom call and the office around it faded. Ulysses found himself in a quiet, sunlit room. There were no screens. No keyboards. Just people talking, gesturing, and collaborating. All of them were wearing tags: Human-Centered Product Manager, Interaction Systems Architect, Behavioral Product Strategist, Experience Integration Lead, and Cognitive Systems Engineer.</p><p>A tall, calm figure stood there. This Ghost didn’t look scary. It looked … Ulysses didn’t know how exactly, but maybe something like empowered?!</p><p>“I know what you think. You’ve looked at the job titles and now you think UX is dead,” the Ghost said. “But you are confusing the <em>title</em> with the <em>discipline</em>. We are all designers in one way or the other. I used to be called a ‘UX designer,’ but that was a long time ago.”</p><p>“Where are the screens?” Ulysses asked, looking for a laptop.</p><p>“Gone,” the Ghost smiled. “Or rather, the ideas of ‘screens’ and ‘average users’ are gone. Why would we design one interface on just 5 different screens, but for millions of users? The ‘average’ user never existed anyway.”</p><p>The Ghost waved a hand, and Ulysses saw a vision of the future:</p><h4>1. The End of the Screen (as we know it)</h4><p>“People here don’t draw pages,” the Ghost explained. “They define systems and constraints. They design components and the rules that govern them — ‘The header is always top,’ ‘Component A prioritizes over Component B,’ and so on. An AI takes those components and rules and generates hyper-personalized interfaces for every single user, adapted to their specific device and context.”</p><h4>2. The Designer as Educator</h4><p>Ulysses saw a Human-Centered Product Manager sitting with a Behavioral Product Strategist and a Cognitive Systems Engineer in what seemed to be a very intensive coaching session. “We stopped fighting the inevitable,” the Ghost said. “We embraced the fact that stakeholders, engineers, and product managers want — and need — to be involved in design. So we became force multipliers. We realized that — just like with research—you can’t prevent ‘non-designers’ from designing. But they need support and guidance to ensure the best outcome for the user. Now, our job is to empower <em>everyone</em> to solve their problems with the right design methods, so we can focus on the really wicked stuff and strategy. Oh, and you of course noticed already, but we all got new titles and merged with other disciplines, because in the end, <em>everything</em> is design and nobody understood UX correctly, anyway.”​</p><h4>3. The Death of the “Monkey Worker”</h4><p>“But what about AI?” Ulysses asked. “Did it replace us?”<br />“Obviously not. It replaced the monkey workers,” the Ghost answered firmly. “It replaced the rote production of UI assets. But it couldn’t replace the creative problem solving. Real designers aren’t monkey workers. They are strategic partners. The term ‘UX Designer’ might have vanished from job descriptions, merged into Product or Engineering, but the <em>practice</em> of UX is more vital than ever. Because one thing is for sure: there’ll always be users, and there’ll always be experiences.”</p><h3>The End of It</h3><p>Ulysses Xavier woke up with a start. The orangey light of his monitors seemed to hum softly.</p><p>He looked at his LinkedIn feed again. The doom-mongering articles were still there. The job market was still tough. But for the first time in months — maybe years — he didn’t feel cynical.</p><p>He realized that if he kept clinging to some kind of nostalgic understanding of UX from 1995, 2005, or 2015, he would indeed become a fossil. But if he embraced the shift? If he stopped designing screens for made-up personas that didn’t exist and started designing systems and strategy for an AI to build upon?</p><p>“UX isn’t dying,” Ulysses whispered to his empty room. “It’s merely growing up and finding a new identity.”</p><p>He sat up, opened LinkedIn Learning and typed: “How to build AI systems.” Then, he created a new document and began to jot down the concept for a proper design system for his websites.</p><p><em>Hi! 👋🏻 I’m </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximilianspeicher/""><em>Max</em></a><em>, a Product Design Director and Freelance Product Consultant with a Ph.D. in computer science.

<p>2025 was a standout year for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/spring-skincare-trends-2025"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">skincare trends</a>. In the spring, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/autumn-winter-skincare-trends-2024"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">polynucleotides — DNA derived from salmon</a> or trout — took off, with experts using them in facial treatments to repair skin and boost hydration. By summer, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/led-face-mask-red-light-skin-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">LED face masks</a> were everywhere, praised for their ability to reduce acne and stimulate collagen. Fall then marked the megawatt return of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pat-mcgrath-glass-skin-fetish-mask-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">glass skin</a>. But with another year on the horizon, you can bet that it’ll be packed with even more skincare innovations to try. </p>



<p>Whether your main goal is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-sulfur-10-powder-to-cream-concentrate-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">clearing up your skin</a> or investing in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-beauty-led-face-mask-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">skincare tech</a>, here are the five trends experts say will reign supreme in 2026 — and there’s something for everyone, no matter your skin type or budget. </p>



<h2>The next wave of Korean skincare </h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/miamiapark/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mia Park</a>, founder of New York–based K-beauty brand <a href=""https://stay-lazy.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lazy Skincare</a>, says we’ve only seen the beginning of what <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/is-korean-skincare-better-expert-advice"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Korean skincare</a> can achieve. “The next wave of innovation is already emerging as Korean labs push boundaries in texture science, botanicals, and multifunctional formulas,” says Park. Lazy’s <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstay-lazy.com%2Fproducts%2Fdouble-duty"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Double Duty</a> — a serum-moisturizer duo — is an example of how brands are combining effective plant-based ingredients (think red camellia and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bakuchiol-natural-retinol-alternative"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">bakuchiol to target uneven skin tone</a>, and silver ear mushroom to boost moisture) with skin-strengthening, fast-healing peptides and oil-controlling niacinamide.  </p>



<p>K-beauty treatments are set to make their way into skincare clinics, too. Local Dynamic Micro-Massage, or LDM, utilizes dual-frequency ultrasound to stimulate collagen and elastin — key proteins that provide skin with structure and strength. A 20-minute session can also reduce inflammation and support the skin barrier, the outermost layer that locks in moisture and keeps out bacteria. LDM should always be performed by a qualified dermatologist or esthetician. </p>



<h2>Slow-release skincare </h2>



<p>If you’ve fallen into the “more is more” trap — overloading your skin with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">high concentrations of retinoids</a>, exfoliating acids, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vitamin-c-alternatives-sensitive-skin"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">antioxidants like vitamin C</a> — advanced facialist <a href=""https://mariamabbas.co.uk/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mariam Abbas</a> says that the slow-release skincare trend is for you. She points out that many brands are now “encapsulating” their formulas, wrapping potent ingredients in tiny moisturizing capsules for controlled release. They reach the skin a little more slowly but still deliver results — without irritation. </p>



<p>Take <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinkeylist.com%2Fproducts%2Fstarter-retinol"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Inkey List’s new Starter Retinol Serum</a>, which features encapsulated retinol. The encapsulated ingredient acts like a cushion, targeting uneven skin tone, texture, and fine lines while minimizing the risk of sore, sensitive, dry, or flaky skin. If you’re a seasoned retinoid user, try the brand’s <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinkeylist.com%2Fproducts%2Fadvanced-retinal"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Advanced 0.2% Retinal Serum</a>. Not to be confused with retinol, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">retin<em>al</em> works faster</a> because it requires fewer steps to convert into retinoic acid on the skin — the active ingredient that actually gets to work. The retinal in this product is also encapsulated, which helps make dry, sensitive skin much less of a concern. </p>



<p>If you prefer exfoliating acids, opt for a leave-on formula that works gradually, rather than a high-strength flash mask that can leave skin feeling parched. Try <a href=""https://www.timeline.com/skincare/products/resurfacing-exfoliator"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Timeline Skincare’s Mito-Biotic Resurfacing Exfoliator</a>, which uses a balanced trifecta of acids — including gentle salicylic, lactic, and mandelic acids — to help prevent breakouts while improving skin texture and tone.</p>





<h2>Skin wellbeing </h2>



<p>“A cultural shift is underway, and living well is replacing the need to appear busy,” says Park, adding, “This mindset is reshaping beauty,” specifically, skincare. Bloomberg recently proclaimed that “<a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-09/wellness-is-the-new-nightlife-as-young-people-drink-less"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">wellness is the new nightlife</a>,” Park points out, and she says that in 2026, the skincare products that will succeed are those that support “calm, recovery, and low-stress routines.”  </p>



<p>Lazy’s <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstay-lazy.com%2Fproducts%2Fdouble-duty"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Double Duty Serum Moisturizer Duo</a> features squalane, glycerin, hyaluronic acid, and peptides to hydrate, moisturize, and support the skin’s natural healing response. Skincare packed with vitamins is another option — like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fdermalogica-biolumin-c-night-restore-serum-with-pro-vitamin-d-complex-P512961%3F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dermalogica Biolumin-C Night Restore Serum with Pro-Vitamin D Complex</a>, which brightens and strengthens the skin barrier overnight. <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP455365"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Inkey List’s Vitamin B, C, and E Moisturizer</a> helps control excess oil, shields against environmental aggressors such as pollution, and provides deep hydration in one go. </p>



<p>We’ll also see more products spotlighting matcha and green tea as hero ingredients, helping to protect skin from urban stressors thanks to their antioxidant properties. Try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.timeline.com%2Fskincare%2Fproducts%2Ffirming-serum"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Timeline Skincare Mito-Biotic Firming Serum</a>, infused with green tea, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fmatcha-calming-cream-pimprod2055952%3Fsku%3D2651317"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">TirTir Matcha Calming Cream</a> to help quell redness. Park makes a great point: “You can’t out-serum an exhausted nervous system, but beauty products that make space for rest is the future.” </p>





<h2>Underspending on the basics </h2>



<p>Dermatologist <a href=""https://www.dropheliaveraitch.co.uk/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Ophelia Veraitch</a> has noticed that many patients assume the more expensive a product, the better the results. “That’s rarely true,” she says. In fact, she recommends sticking to the basics for cleansers and moisturizers. There are plenty of excellent, affordable options for all skin types, including <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP505274"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary Glucoside Foaming Cleanser</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fhydrating-facial-cleanser-xlsImpprod4190255%3Fsku%3D2241933"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser</a>, and <a href=""https://www.target.com/p/byoma-blemish-acne-clearing-creamy-cleanser-5-91-fl-oz/-/A-94468810"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Byoma Blemish Clearing Creamy Cleanser</a>.  </p>



<p>When it comes to moisturizers, simple is often best, especially if you’re layering serums with active ingredients like retinol, vitamin C, or exfoliating acids. Our favorites include <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fhydro-boost-hyaluronic-acid-water-gel-moisturizer-xlsImpprod12041835%3Fsku%3D2284291"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fholy-hydration-daily-moisturizer-xlsImpprod14481069%3Fsku%3D2500311"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">e.l.f. Holy Hydration Moisturizer</a>, and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FCetaphil-Daily-Oil-Free-Hydrating-Lotion-with-Hyaluronic-Acid-3-fl-oz%2F55092626"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cetaphil Daily Hydrating Lotion</a>. </p>



<p>Dr. Veraitch recommends investing in high-quality active ingredients suited to your skin type and concerns, for example, niacinamide for oily or acne-prone skin, or hyaluronic acid for dry, dehydrated skin, along with a reliable, high-factor broad-spectrum sunscreen. “This matters far more than price,” she says. </p>







<h2>Minimalism is the new luxury </h2>



<p>“In 2026, the most desirable routines won’t be the longest,” says Park, “they’ll be the smartest.” With budgets tightening and dermatologists noting that multi-step skincare routines can sometimes be counterproductive, Park predicts we’ll favor fewer products, clearer choices, and formulas that truly multitask. </p>



<p>Think moisturizers packed with active ingredients that can replace toners and serums. R29 recommends <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fmajor-fade-active-seal-dark-spot-vitamin-c-gel-moisturizer-P510561"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Idriss Major Fade Active Seal Moisturizer</a>, which features brightening vitamin C and eliminates the need for a dedicated serum. Also worth trying are <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fsuperactive-mattifying-oil-pore-control-moisturizer-spf-50-pimprod2050402%3Fsku%3D2635510"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Murad Superactive Mattifying Oil + Pore Control Moisturizer SPF 50</a>, a high-factor SPF with oil-reducing niacinamide, and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbyoma-blemish-acne-control-moisturizer-1-69-fl-oz%2F-%2FA-94468812"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Byoma Blemish Acne Control Moisturizer</a>, which uses salicylic acid to prevent new breakouts while providing deep hydration. </p>



<p>Park says that minimalism isn’t about doing less for your skin. “It’s about guiltlessly skipping what doesn’t matter and prioritizing what does.”  </p>

<p>In his recent cold-weather trend report, hair artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tomsmithhd/?hl=en"">Tom Smith</a> predicted that muted mid — essentially “soft, neutral-warm shades that sit between blonde, brunette, and copper” — will reign supreme. “It’s a fusion of all the recent trends, but intentionally subtle and noncommittal,” says Smith. Think Hailey Bieber, Taylor Swift, and Madelaine Petsch — or content creator <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DDsFPXUNEPd/?hl=en"">Zoe Hayes</a> here. Shades like this are low-maintenance, versatile, and chic, adds Smith. “Simply ask for a natural earthy undertone to your shade of choice and maintain it with glossing treatments to keep the finish refined and the color looking shiny and intentional.” We swear by <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fglazehair.com%2Fcollections%2Fsuper-gloss"">Glaze’s Supergloss</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/seanmichaelhair/?hl=en"">Sean Michael</a>, a Boston-based balayage specialist and owner of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thesalonbeau/?hl=en"">Salon Beau</a>, identifies “cherry cola brunette” as the brooding shade to watch this winter. “It’s all thanks to the rich depth and understated hint of cherry tone,” explains Michael, much like this shade on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DMYY3uhofIy/?img_index=1"">Alice x T</a>. “It gives dark hair a moody, polished glow without tipping into a full red, making it a great choice for brunettes who want something new.” Fortunately, cherry cola brunette suits everyone. “Ask your stylist for a deep brunette base enhanced with soft violet-red lowlights or a cherry-toned gloss to create that cola-inspired richness,” advises Michael.</p>

<p>“Honey butter blonde is poised to dominate winter because warm, creamy shades are finally taking the spotlight again,” says Michael. This shade is defined by a “soft candlelit glow” that adds brightness and shine to hair during an otherwise moody season. “To get the look, ask your colorist for a warm-neutral blonde with subtle golden dimension and a glossy finish to enhance that buttery warmth,” Michael says.

Jacob used Schwarzkopf Professional’s Vario Blond SuperPlus and BlondMe Premium Lightener 9+ to create a handful of face-cupping highlights and lighter ends. The pièce de résistance was toning the lengths with Igora Vibrance, giving the color a more effortless vibe.

<p>In his trend report, Smith describes gothic brunette as an “ultra-dark, almost inky brunette with intense depth and shine,” like this color posted to Instagram by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DROY7h_Ebg4/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Ryenne Snow</a>. This shade works best for those with a naturally dark base, he explains, suggesting you ask your colorist for an espresso- or black cherry-toned gloss to take your natural color a shade or two deeper. The darker the hair, the glossier it appears as it catches the light. Look to Margaret Qualley, Kendall Jenner, and Nicola Peltz Beckham for inspiration.</p>

<p>Gonzalez pinpoints golden strawberry blonde as the hair color to watch, thanks to its luminosity and sunshine vibes — something we seriously lack in the drab winter months. “This shade combines the brightness of blonde with copper warmth, creating a glowing look that feels fresh,” explains Gonzalez, adding that it’s great for blondes who want warmth and depth, or brunettes ready to go a little lighter. “Just ask for a warm honey base with golden copper undertones or face-framing pieces,” says Gonzalez. This shade created by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DFFMyfGST6U/"">Sophie Malic</a> is beautiful.</p>

<p>“This hair color technique involves low-commitment demi-permanent glosses that deepen your natural base by one or two levels, while keeping your existing highlights visible,” says <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/treehousehair/?hl=en"">Travis Ogletree</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.moroccanoil.com%2F"">Moroccanoil</a> colorist ambassador. He notes that many of his clients flirt with the idea of going darker but don’t want to lose the effortless, lived-in dimension they’ve built. “An all-over gloss is the perfect middle ground,” says Ogletree. “It adds shine, tone, and depth without feeling heavy.” In the salon, Ogletree reaches for the <a href=""https://moroccanoilprofessionals.com/products/color-calypso-demi-permanent-gloss-cream/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Moroccanoil Color Calypso Demi-Permanent Color</a>. “The Gloss and Cream options are both perfect for this.” Look to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DN-ytYcDZbg/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Rachel Redd</a>’s post on Instagram for inspiration. </p>

<p>“At some point, most of us have said that our hair looked its best when we were kids,” says Ogletree, “so ‘born blonde’ is more of an ideology than a trend because it’s based on what naturally suited you — whether that was bright blonde, sandy tones, or soft pops on the ends.” All you need to do? Bring in a photo of yourself as a child. “Those small details help your stylist recreate a version that feels authentic and flattering,” says Ogletree, who turns to Moroccanoil’s Blonde Voyage portfolio of lighteners, specifically Clay and Cream, to lighten clients’ hair. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPo9gyigrgF/?hl=en"">Marco Gilento</a> nails this shade here.</p>

<p>Schwartz describes light suede blonde as a “luminous,” bright shade that frames the face and adds soft depth through the lengths — think of the way a suede bag subtly glistens in winter sun. “It’s setting the tone for one of the season’s most coveted blondes,” he says.

<p>Michael touts this earthier shade as a “cool-neutral blend” that adds dimension and gives brunette hair an expensive look — much like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DGuKJk4v6TN/"">this creation by @a_knack_yuna</a>. It’s all about the soft, smoky gradient, Michael says. “This flatters a wide range of skin tones and grows out seamlessly, making it perfect for anyone who wants low-maintenance color that still feels modern.” Michael recommends asking your colorist for a neutral brunette base with ashy balayage throughout. “This will create that seamless mocha-toned transition,” he says.</p>

<p>This hair color trend draws from eras past. “It’s a honeyed but muted blonde that feels retro and nostalgic, yet still fresh,” says Smith in his trend report. Perfect for colder months, it adds a subtle warmth. “This works best for natural blondes or brunettes looking to add warmth in a mature, elegant way while keeping depth and medium contrast,” he explains. Smith recommends asking your colorist for a “muted golden balayage” or a warm gloss after highlights to bring richness back into your strands.

<p>Greige occupies a cozy space between grey and beige, says Smith, adding, “It honors natural silver while brightening and warming the complexion.” Greige is a perfect middle ground for those who want to embrace, rather than cover, their natural hair, he notes, while the added richness from blonde highlights keeps it feeling fresh and dimensional.

<p>“Muted blonde sits between bright blonde and light brunette,” says Gonzalez. “Think soft beige, sandy, or mushroom shades of blonde rather than high-lift platinum. It balances warm and cool undertones for a gentle ‘lived-in’ effect.” If you have light-to-medium blonde hair or light brown lengths and want to soften your color a bit, Gonzalez says a simple salon gloss can get you there. This color by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DFehTNpzQbw/?hl=en"">Diane Gorgievski</a> is stunning.</p>

When the leaves have left the trees, the air turns cold and misty, and the temperature stays 50 degrees (or below), there’s only one thing to do. Tuck yourself under a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cozy-season-essentials-editors-picks"">toasty blanket</a> for as long as socially acceptable with a collection of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/12/186063/cheesy-christmas-movies-on-netflix"">comfort movies</a> right by your side.<br /><br />There’s no shortage of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/11/217808/christmas-movie-tropes"">good Christmas films</a>. Classics like <em>Elf </em>or <em>Rudolph: Red Nose Reindeer </em>are perfect comedies and low-stakes dramas to watch with your friends and families. But they’re not the most snug and soul-warming flicks out there. Yes, they’re all about the holiday cheer (which is an element of coziness), but they’re more funny and entertaining than anything. <br /><br />No, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/07/163987/best-feel-good-movies"">perfect cozy film</a> has a story that’ll tug at your heartstrings but will also make you ugly laugh. <br /><br />To ease your quest for the coziest film, we searched far and wide (aka the libraries of most major streaming services) for the best cozy movies the internet has to offer this holiday season. Some are new, some are oldies but goodies; some have absolutely nothing to do with the holidays at all. Regardless, these are the most heartwarming films to watch by yourself (or with friends and family) on the sofa by the crackling fire with a cup of cocoa and a tray of Snickerdoodles.  Merry streaming.  <figure><figcaption><strong><em><h2>The Wrong Paris (2025)</h2></em></strong><em>The Wrong Paris</em> makes for the ultimate comfort movie when you’re over holiday movies but still want that feel-good buzz. On the surface, it’s a breezy Netflix rom-com about Dawn (Miranda Cosgrove), an aspiring artist who joins a Bachelor-style reality show thinking she’s headed to Paris, France — only to land in Paris, Texas instead, thanks to an outrageous producer twist. What follows is a lighthearted mix of reality-show antics, cowboy charm (hello, Trey, played by Pierson Fodé), and the kind of predictable but satisfying romantic beats that make you sigh with relief rather than eye-roll with exhaustion.<br /><br /><strong>Stream it on <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/81700163"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Netflix</a></strong>.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><strong><em>The Best Man Holiday</em> (2013)</strong></h2><br /> <br />A rare sequel that’s better than the original, <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sanaa-lathan-interview"">The Best Man Holiday</a> </em>is a must-watch every holiday season (though, we argue it’s a great film to watch all year round). Similar to its predecessor, it follows a group of college friends gathering again, this time for the holidays. But unlike the first film where secrets stayed hidden and buried, everything is out in the open this go-around and past hurts and old resentments threaten the holiday cheer. Watch this for the laughs, the cries, and the fuzzy feels. <br /><br /><strong>Stream it on </strong><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.7f4b0fc9-c7e1-4ce2-8fd9-1f0239de8d27?autoplay=0&amp;ref_=atv_cf_strg_wb""><strong>Prime Video</strong></a><strong>.</strong></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Home Alone (1990)</em></h2><br /><br />John Hughes, the mind behind <em>Ferris Buller’s Day Off</em>, <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/breakfast-club-30th-anniversary"">The Breakfast Club</a></em>, <em>Pretty in Pin</em>k, etc., also did big with this 1990 flick. The classic holiday movie, which made Macaulay Culkin’s scream an iconic staple imitated by kids everywhere, may be more than 30 years old, but you’ll never get tired of it because it has *literally* everything you want from a cozy film.

There’s something nostalgic about watching little kids in their onesies, drinking cocoa, anxious to meet Saint Nick. It makes you think of simpler times, when you used to be that age full of wonder, innocence, and excitement. <br /><br /><strong>Stream it on </strong><a href=""https://www.max.com/movies/f98c234d-660a-417e-9732-0d920d4b40f8""><strong>Max</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=""https://www.hulu.com/watch/cfaafa9b-a8e0-4d0a-88bd-c3fecfbf695b""><strong>Hulu</strong></a><strong>, and </strong><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.71df62ca-d7a1-4626-aa07-27836d37e8d9""><strong>Prime Video</strong></a><strong>.</strong></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Last Holiday (2006) </em></h2><br /><br />Who’d thought a film about a terminally ill woman jet-setting to Europe for one last hoorah would be one of the coziest films ever?

In this 1989 film starring rom-com queen Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal, we follow the titular Harry and Sally over a decade as they bounce from strangers to friends to enemies (it’s complicated, okay??) and finally lovers.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828686.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-planners"">2026 is the money year</a> many of us have been preparing for without even realizing it. In numerology, 2026 adds up to 1, the number of beginnings, boldness, and unfiltered potential. And because it carries the purity of initiation, it asks us to step into the frontier of our lives with intention. Layer that with the fact that 2026 is the Year of the Fire Horse in Chinese astrology, and suddenly the collective energy becomes unmistakable. Fire Horse years do not whisper… they gallop. They set the air ablaze with courage, momentum, and manifestation. So financially this means we aren’t thinking small in 2026. We’re thinking fast, wide, brave, and new.</p>



<p>Astrologically, this rebirth is echoed by Saturn and Neptune both entering Aries, the first sign of the zodiac. Saturn, the planet of responsibility, structure, and mastery, joins Neptune, the planet of dreams, intuition, and surrender. Aries is the flame that says “go,” even when you’re shaking. So we enter a year where dreams demand structure… and structure demands imagination. Fire and faith are learning to coexist. We’re collectively remembering that discipline is sacred, that courage is spiritual, and that starting over is a portal, not a punishment. This is a year of initiation that doesn’t wait for your confidence before giving you the opportunity. It gives you the opportunity so your confidence can rise to meet it.</p>



<p>By contrast, 2025 was the Year of the Snake, a numerology 9 year, and a cycle of closures, purging, and spiritual composting. Many of us spent 2025 confronting the roots of our money stories… the fears we inherited, the habits we unconsciously upheld, the emotional knots tied to worth, earning, and receiving. We learned that money isn’t just currency, it’s spiritual energy… a mirror of our subconscious relationship with safety, sovereignty, and expansion. 2025 loosened the soil. It forced us to acknowledge where we shrink, where we self-abandon, and where we avoid our deepest desires. Those realizations were not meant to break us. They were meant to prepare us.</p>



<p>Now, in 2026, the universe says: apply it. This is a year of experimentation, risk-taking, courage, and embodied learning. The best way to integrate what we healed in 2025 is to <em>become</em> the version of ourselves we kept envisioning. Many of us will feel the pull toward entrepreneurship or creative independence — not out of pressure, but out of alignment. Jupiter’s entrance into Leo (on June 30th) and the ascent of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/pluto-retrograde-in-aquarius-may-2025-meaning-effects"">Pluto in Aquarius</a> until 2044 is accelerating this shift. Pluto transforms whatever it touches, and Aquarius rules innovation, digital futures, alternative paths, and self-liberation. I predicted last year that we’d collectively turn toward entrepreneurship, and now we’re entering the phase where that prediction becomes undeniable.</p>



<p>And the energy intensifies: Saturn and Neptune in Aries form harmonious aspects to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/pluto-retrograde-in-aquarius-may-2025-meaning-effects"">Pluto in Aquarius</a>, helping us translate ideas into systems, visions into strategies. Then in July 2026, Uranus enters Gemini, creating a rare triad of Fire and Air that electrifies communication, creativity, and financial flow. Suddenly money comes more easily from simply being yourself: from speaking your truth, showcasing your gifts, sharing your weird, unfiltered magic with the world. Throat chakras open, creative channels widen, and opportunities meet you halfway. But this acceleration comes with a challenge: the temptation to move too fast, burn too quickly, and forget the foundations needed to sustain your success.</p>



<p>Because with all this Fire and Air dominating the cosmos in 2026, many of us will feel the urge to leap without looking: to quit the job, impulsively start the business, launch the product, change the career, monetize the art, reinvent every aspect of our lives overnight. And while that instinct is part of the collective medicine, it only works if it’s paired with grounding. True wealth is built through rhythm, through containers, through systems that can hold your expansion. Your task this year isn’t just to dream or to leap; it’s to <em>architect</em>. To create sustainable frameworks for your passion. To invest in the future self you’re becoming through education, mentorship, coaching, real estate, stocks, creative tools, business infrastructure, or values-aligned ventures. Every investment in 2026 echoes for the next decade.</p>



<p>This year’s eclipses deepen the storyline with fated financial and professional turning points. The February 17th New Moon Solar Eclipse in Aquarius (28°) may bring a major opportunity to join or build community. Your digital presence might expand. Your work may reach more people. Yet because it squares Uranus in Taurus, you’ll need to check in with your values and avoid spaces that don’t fully resonate. Then on March 3rd, the Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo pushes you out of your comfort zone professionally, revealing where you’ve been settling, playing small, or overworking. Many will quit jobs, request raises, restructure workflows, or choose rest to reclaim balance.</p>



<p>Later in the year, the August 12th Total Solar Eclipse in Leo arrives as a creative rebirth, especially potent for artists, performers, and entrepreneurs. This is the moment to launch, to reveal, to be seen. And finally, the August 28th Partial Lunar Eclipse in Pisces delivers emotional, intuitive, serendipitous blessings… the kind of blessings that feel like miracles. This is where dreams break through the material realm.</p>



<p>But perhaps the most important theme of 2026 is this: authenticity becomes currency. Pluto in Aquarius and Uranus in Gemini harmonize throughout the second half of the year, inviting us to embrace our eccentricities, our quirks, our rare inner genius. The world is saturated with imitation. What people crave — and pay for — is truth. Your weirdness is your wealth. Your originality is your open door. This is the year where posting that unfiltered IG dump, sharing the opinion no one else dares to say, or releasing the art only you could create becomes the catalyst for financial and spiritual expansion. When you stop hiding your true self, the opportunities meant for your true self finally find you.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828720.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Aries, 2026 is literally <em>your</em> era. Like, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/02/11280107/main-character-trend-tiktok-aesthetic-lifestyle"">main-character-walks-in</a>-and-the-crowd-goes-silent energy. With Saturn and Neptune both in your sign, you’re stepping into a cosmic bootcamp that’s half discipline, half dream alchemy. Saturn, the planet of responsibility, is teaching you how to build structures that actually protect your fire instead of dimming it. Neptune, the planet of compassion and creativity, is reminding you that money comes when your heart is in the room. The secret to your financial growth this year is the fusion: fun and consistency.</p>



<p>If your creativity felt stale or if your finances dipped last year, it wasn’t because you lost your magic — you were in spiritual hibernation, healing things nobody saw. Now Saturn wants you to create a rhythm, a workflow, a “don’t-burn-yourself-out-this-time” container. And Neptune wants you to actually enjoy what you’re building. Think: turning your passion project into a real business, but doing it in a way that feels like play. Aries is discovering that “grown-up money” doesn’t have to feel boring… it can feel like freedom.</p>



<p>Starting July 7th, Uranus in Taurus leaves your financial sector (since 2018 it was giving “one month I’m up, next month I’m down, next month I’m manifesting rent from thin air”), and enters Gemini, your communication zone. Translation: your <em>voice</em> becomes a revenue stream. The more you speak, write, teach, post, present, or share your unfiltered Aries takes… the more money finds you. This is “launch the Substack,” “start the podcast with your bestie,” “post that TikTok even if your hair isn’t ‘ready’,” “finally write the ebook,” and “accept that panel invitation you think you’re not qualified for.” Uranus in Gemini is literally begging you to diversify your income like a bold entrepreneur. You’re suddenly generating ideas faster than you can type them. And the best part? People actually listen. Your words hit, your humor lands, and your authenticity magnetizes opportunities you used to pray for. This is the year where an Aries rant goes viral and changes your life.</p>



<p>The plot thickens on March 3rd with the Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo, activating your work, routine, and health sector. This eclipse is basically your cosmic intervention. Something in your day-to-day workflow has been draining you… unhealthy pacing, lack of boundaries, doing everything alone, micromanaging every detail, eating lunch at 4pm because “you forgot” (Aries… <em>please</em>).</p>



<p>The eclipse pulls the curtain back and forces you to see what you’ve outgrown. It may look like quitting a job that’s low-key been shrinking your spirit, delegating tasks you’ve  been gatekeeping, switching industries, taking a sabbatical, or simply restructuring your routine so you’re not sprinting through your life every day. It’s uncomfortable but liberating, and it clears the path for actual abundance. Then the August 12th New Moon Solar Eclipse in Leo enters like the grand finale of a Beyoncé concert, activating your creativity, your romance, your fame sector. Something you create within six months of this eclipse could skyrocket your visibility. A passion project becomes a revenue stream. A hobby becomes a brand. A “just for fun” idea becomes the thing that makes everyone say, “Wait… you did THAT?”</p>



<p>And through all of this, remember: you’ve earned this era. Saturn and Neptune spent years in your spirituality and closure sector, dragging you into self-reflection mode, forcing you to heal wounds you never had time to acknowledge. That wasn’t punishment… it was preparation. Now they’re in your sign saying, “Rise.”</p>



<p>Aries is one of the zodiac’s biggest winners in the Fire Horse year and the numerology One year. The universe is literally asking you to initiate the life you’ve been imagining, not in a reckless way, but in a <em>visionary warrior</em> way. You are the hero of your story in 2026, and money flows where courage meets consistency. When you stop playing small with your gifts and start structuring your brilliance, everything changes for the better. This is your year to build the foundation of a life that feels both prosperous and true. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828721.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Taurus, 2026 is the year the universe lovingly pushes you out of your comfort zone and into your calling. With Saturn and Neptune in Aries activating your spirituality and healing sector for the next two years (and Neptune for over a decade), your relationship to money becomes more soulful, more intuitive, and more values-driven. You’re realizing that your financial expansion is directly tied to your spiritual alignment. Many Tauruses will feel called toward work that heals, guides, restores, or uplifts, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2022/05/10982731/too-much-therapy"">whether that’s therapy</a>, astrology, Pilates teaching, Reiki, intuitive coaching, wellness work, or even starting a “soft-life” content platform rooted in emotional wisdom.</p>



<p>And if you’re already in these fields, Saturn blesses you with the discipline to structure your offerings, raise your rates, and stop apologizing for charging what your gifts are worth. Neptune meanwhile whispers: “It’s okay to be spiritual <em>and</em> well-paid.” And if you’re in a corporate path that feels spiritually dead, you may feel an unmistakable urge to leave — like your soul is tapping you on the shoulder saying… “We’re done here.”</p>



<p>And then comes the cosmic plot twist: Uranus finally leaves your sign in July after eight roller-coaster years that rocked your identity, finances, relationships, and stability. Many Tauruses went through job losses, career pivots, moves, breakups, breakthroughs, glow ups, and reinventions during Uranus in Taurus… the universe basically sent you through “unstable earth sign bootcamp.” But on July 7th, 2026, Uranus enters Gemini, activating your money and income sector, and suddenly the pressure eases. You start feeling… lighter. More curious. More open to experimenting with new streams of income.</p>



<p>Uranus prefers the airiness of Gemini, so this shift feels like the universe finally cutting you a break. BUT, the catch is: you cannot control your money flow the way you used to. Uranus in Gemini makes money feel like a game of cosmic ping-pong: ideas flying everywhere, inspiration hitting at random times, unexpected deposits, unexpected opportunities, unexpected collaborations. The more flexible you are, the more fun you have with it, the more wealthy you become. Taurus’ biggest challenge will be letting go of rigidity and letting your money breathe. Treat it like play, not punishment.</p>



<p>Financial blessings begin early, though, particularly around the Full Moon in Sagittarius on May 31st, which activates your wealth, investments, and shared resources sector. Something you initiated or dreamed about during Sagittarius Season 2025 could manifest in a major way. This is prime energy for payouts, inheritances, scholarships, royalties, business investments bearing fruit, or finally getting approved for something you’ve been waiting on. It’s also a good period for debt reduction or consolidation, financial healing, and calling in support from outside sources without shame.</p>



<p>Then, the August 8th Partial Lunar Eclipse in Pisces lights up your community, technology, and networks sector, meaning one online moment could change everything. A post goes viral. A connection leads to funding. A collaboration expands your audience. A LinkedIn update brings job offers. Or you join a community that ends up opening doors you didn’t even know existed. This eclipse is loud about the importance of being seen and sharing your art, your wisdom, your story, your gifts — especially online.</p>



<p>And yes… all of this becomes so much easier once Uranus leaves your sign. The first half of 2026 still carries that “final exam” energy — the kind where the universe asks, “Did you learn how to adapt or nah?” But by the second half of the year, you genuinely feel like your head breaks above water for the first time in years. You’re calmer, clearer, more intuitive, and more confident in your worth. You stop clutching your money out of fear and finally begin circulating it with trust. You stop hiding your gifts and start monetizing them with integrity. And above all, you surrender your tight grip on control and let abundance come the way it wants to. 2026 is the year where Taurus finally exhales and says… “Wow. My time really has come.”</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828722.jpg?width=852&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=213%3A256"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Gemini… 2026 feels like someone finally opened the window and let the light pour back into your life. With Saturn and Neptune in Aries entering <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/age-gap-friendship-benefits-different-generations"">your friendship, networks</a>, and tech sector, you’re stepping into an era where your connections, your community, and your ability to “just show up and play” become your greatest financial assets. The professional fog of the past few years finally lifts. Saturn in Pisces had you second-guessing your purpose, doubting your abilities, and working behind the scenes in ways that didn’t always offer immediate results. Now Saturn in Aries gives you structure through collaboration, and Neptune gives you soul through community.</p>



<p>Your money this year is directly tied to networking, sharing your gifts publicly, being seen, and letting your natural charisma circulate. Healing modalities, community organizing, digital platforms, group projects, and social-media-based entrepreneurship explode for you. You’re not meant to do 2026 alone… your revenue streams literally expand through your relationships.</p>



<p>The first major breakthrough arrives around the February 17th Aquarius Solar Eclipse, lighting up your expansion, travel, and higher-learning sector. This is the eclipse that could put you on a plane, in a classroom, on a stage, or in an entirely different timezone. Whatever intentions you set around this eclipse — studying something new, launching a business, traveling for work, relocating, applying for visas, accepting opportunities abroad, pursuing entrepreneurship, enrolling in a certificate — will directly link to your income over the next six months. Think “international checks,” “global clients,” “remote work upgrades,” or “publishing something that reaches way more people than expected.”</p>



<p>You’re not meant to think small this year… Aquarius energy demands liberation. And then Jupiter stations direct in Cancer on March 10th, unblocking money flows, dissolving limiting beliefs about earning, and helping you trust your value again. This is when you stop undercharging, under-selling, or underestimating yourself. Money begins moving again.</p>



<p>But the real spotlight moment arrives when Jupiter enters Leo on June 30th, lighting upyour communication sector and saying, “We can’t let you hide anymore.” Jupiter in Leo amplifies your voice, your humor, your content, your aesthetic, your intelligence, and your creative output. People notice you. They want to hear you speak, read your writing, buy your products, or engage with your work. Opportunities come from podcasts, panels, TikToks, Instagram reels, newsletters, courses, vlogs, workshops… basically anything that allows you to share your brain and your brilliance.</p>



<p>Jupiter in Cancer had you stacking coins behind the scenes. Jupiter in Leo puts you center stage. And it harmonizes beautifully with Gemini energy — so shining feels natural instead of forced. There’s also massive financial potential through media, publishing, presentations, collaborations, and anything that involves your voice or visibility. You are literally being asked to take up space.</p>



<p>The most powerful awakening arrives during the August 28th Partial Lunar Eclipse in Pisces, activating your career sector. This is the culmination of something you began six months prior, around the Pisces New Moon. And unlike the last few emotional Pisces eclipses, this one comes with clarity — thanks to the full moon being ruled by Jupiter in Leo (your communication sector) and Neptune in Aries (your tech and community sector). Your creative desires, your public image, and your community support suddenly click together like puzzle pieces. You may land a dream role, launch a major project, go viral, receive recognition in your industry, or pivot into a career that aligns with the childlike version of you who always knew what you were meant to do.</p>



<p>This eclipse can push you forward <em>even if you’re not ready</em>, because your soul is ready. The shadow of this year? Uranus in Gemini brings genius downloads, but also unpredictability. Your mind changes fast, your plans shift suddenly, and people may struggle to keep up. Your task is to check in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10751082/should-you-trust-your-gut-instinct"">with your intuition</a> before making promises or financial commitments. As long as you don’t over-promise, you’ll thrive. With the right balance of freedom plus consistency, 2026 becomes one of the most exciting and lucrative years Gemini has had in a long time.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828723.jpg?width=852&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=213%3A256"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Cancer, 2026 begins with the universe practically spoiling you. With Jupiter, the planet of luck and expansion, in your sign for the first six months, you’re walking around with a cosmic spotlight on your gifts. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10751082/should-you-trust-your-gut-instinct"">Your intuition is sharper</a> than ever, and your money magnetism is off the charts. Anything rooted in your identity — your story, your culture, your softness, your nurturing, your humor, your aesthetic, your home — becomes a business opportunity. Home-based businesses thrive. Careers involving children, healing, cooking, interior design, real estate, food content, wellness, and lifestyle influencing thrive. If you’ve ever wanted to be a conscious influencer, write a book, launch a podcast, lead circles, teach something, or build a brand around the way <em>you</em> move through the world… this is the year. Because here’s the secret: your authenticity is your currency.</p>



<p>The more you let previously hidden parts of yourself express themselves, the more abundance arrives. Don’t overthink it. Share what you love and let people see you. Then, the plot twist: Saturn and Neptune join forces in Aries, activating your career sector for the next two years — and Neptune stays over a decade. This is huge. Saturn in Pisces had you drifting, daydreaming, doubting, waiting for “signs” or “perfect timing,” and often being too passive about your ambitions. But Saturn in Aries? That’s a whole new era. It’s saying, “You’re done playing small.” Neptune in Aries reawakens your childhood dreams about what you wanted to be. Saturn then gives you the discipline, structure, and stamina to <em>actually</em> pursue them. Leadership roles, public speaking, creative direction, entrepreneurship, management, becoming the face of something, stepping into authority you didn’t think you were ready for — all of this becomes available. You will feel seen in ways that feel both thrilling and a little uncomfortable. But uncomfortable doesn’t mean wrong. It means growth.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Uranus in Taurus continues shaking up your community, friendships, and technology sector until July 7th — which explains why networking, job applications, referrals, and social connections have felt inconsistent or unpredictable these past seven years. People drifted out. People appeared suddenly. Collaborations dissolved or transformed. When Uranus enters Gemini, your spirituality and subconscious sector awakens dramatically. You may uncover financial fears, scarcity beliefs, ancestral money wounds, or internal narratives that have been quietly running the show. But instead of spiraling, you reinterpret wealth as a multidimensional experience: health, family, safety, joy, creativity, nourishment, emotional fulfillment. Ironically, the moment you stop chasing traditional versions of success and start embracing this spiritual definition of abundance… actual material abundance increases. Your aura softens. Your voice strengthens. People trust you more. Money follows authenticity.</p>



<p>And then comes the financial fireworks. Jupiter enters Leo on June 30th, staying for 13 months, blessing your finances, self-esteem, and earning ability. And topping it all off, the August 12th New Moon Total Solar Eclipse in Leo supercharges a six-month financial rebirth. This is a full-on Leo stellium in your money zone, making Cancer one of the most prosperous signs of 2026. Raises, new jobs, brand partnerships, speaking gigs, real estate wins, viral moments, sold-out offerings, unexpected checks… it’s all on the table.</p>



<p>But here’s the catch: you must stop hiding. Jupiter in Leo wants you center stage. Saturn and Neptune in Aries want you leading. If you retreat into your shell during the biggest glow up of your career, you block blessings. The life hack? Every time you want to shrink, ask yourself: What’s one small step out of the cocoon I can take today? Slowly expand your capacity to shine. Fall in love with the money journey, not just the outcome. Abundance wants you — and for once, you’re fully ready to want it back.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828724.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Leo… this year was practically written for you. A numerology 1 year, a Fire Horse year, and the arrival of Saturn and Neptune in Aries, a fellow Fire sign? This is cosmic synergy. Saturn gives you discipline, structure, and long-game strategy, while Neptune gives you imagination, purpose, and dream-blueprints — and both are activating your expansion, education, and exploration sector. Translation: life wants you to stretch, to risk, to evolve, and to invest in your next level. You’re no longer meant to coast on natural talent alone… you’re being asked to deliberately sharpen your gifts, develop your craft, study what excites you, and say yes to opportunities that expose you to people, places, and possibilities you once thought were “too big.” The fire energy of 2026 (plus Uranus entering Gemini later in the year) lights you up with inspiration, but Saturn keeps you grounded in what actually works. You’re stepping into a year where your ambition is finally matched by cosmic support — but consistency is the key that unlocks it.</p>



<p>Before the spotlight finds you, though, there is a sacred preparation happening. For the first six months of 2026, Jupiter is in Cancer, activating your spiritual, intuitive, and healing sector. This is your incubation period… your chrysalis. You may feel quieter, more reflective, more inwardly focused, and more <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-protect-your-peace"">protective of your peace</a> and energy. Old fears around visibility, self-worth, or deservingness may rise to the surface so they can be released. Jupiter in Cancer shows you the parts of your identity you’ve been hiding, dimming, or underestimating.</p>



<p>All of this emotional groundwork becomes crucial, because when Jupiter enters Leo on June 30th for a 13-month stay… everything accelerates. Suddenly, you’re magnetic. Booked. Center stage. Abundance comes from simply being yourself — boldly, colorfully, unapologetically. What you learned in your quiet season prepares you to receive, hold, and manage the Golden Era that’s coming. Jupiter in Leo is a financial glow up, but it’s also a soul glow up. The more you know who you are, the more the universe can amplify you.</p>



<p>Then comes the moment that changes everything: the August 12th New Moon Total Solar Eclipse in Leo: your cosmic rebirth. This eclipse is your personal reset button, a full-on identity upgrade. Reinvention is not just allowed; it’s inevitable. If you’ve been craving a rebrand, a new creative direction, a shift in industry, a move, or a change in how you present yourself to the world, this eclipse opens the door. Many Leos will start the year making money one way and end the year making it through a completely different, more aligned avenue. Eclipses don’t ask for permission; they accelerate what your soul already chose. If you’ve been secretly wanting to pivot from corporate to creative, from artist to entrepreneur, from behind-the-scenes to center stage, this eclipse is the ignition. With Jupiter in your sign, you’ll have the confidence, charisma, and visibility to make it happen.</p>



<p>But the real anchoring energy of the year comes from Virgo. First, the March 3rd Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo highlights your money, values, and self-worth sector, revealing the financial habits, insecurities, or patterns that need to shift for your wealth to stabilize. Then, on September 10th, we get the first non-eclipse Virgo New Moon in over a year. This is the moment everything clicks. After months of expansion, opportunities, attention, and abundance from Jupiter in Leo, this Virgo New Moon gives you the practical clarity to organize your finances, budget wisely, build systems, and protect your wealth.</p>



<p>Remember Leo: Jupiter expands everything — including spending, indulgence, lifestyle inflation, impulsive purchases, and diva moments. The shadow of your 2026 is thinking you’re unstoppable and forgetting to manage your money. The cure? Virgo discipline. If you take this Virgo New Moon seriously, you end the year not just wealthier… but <em>wealth-stable</em>. Leo’s biggest lesson of 2026 is this: you’re allowed to shine, but you must also steward the light.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828725.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Virgo, 2026 is the year your spirit finally exhales. The March 3rd Total Lunar Eclipse in your sign — on the ascension portal of 3/3 — is the continuation of a cycle that has relentlessly reshaped your relationship with yourself. These Virgo–Pisces eclipses have pushed you to release identities, habits, roles, and financial dynamics that were draining you. They forced you to confront the places where you were over-giving, undercharging, overworking, or tolerating responsibilities that weren’t yours to carry.</p>



<p>This penultimate Virgo eclipse brings clarity, closure, and reclamation. Suddenly, the rejections, delays, endings, and redirections of the past two years start making sense. Jobs that are draining you end. Financial agreements without reciprocity dissolve. And most importantly, you finally outgrow the “comfort zone income ceiling” you unconsciously created for yourself. This eclipse shows you how much more you’re capable of earning — and how deeply you deserve it. Asking for raises, charging more, setting boundaries, leaving unfulfilling roles… it all becomes easier.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Saturn and Neptune enter Aries, joining forces in your shared resources, investments, and generational wealth sector. Neptune will stay for over a decade, Saturn for two years, meaning you’re entering a profound money-mastery era. Saturn gives structure to your long-term financial plans; Neptune gives intuitive guidance and imagination. Together, they ask you to stop downplaying your potential and start building real wealth.</p>



<p>This is the perfect time for Virgos to explore conscious investing, real estate, entrepreneurship, high-yield savings accounts, grants, accelerators, stock or bond portfolios, crowdfunding, or even collaborative income partnerships. You are being initiated into the world of financial expansion… not through hustle culture, but through strategy and alignment. If you’ve ever dreamt of building long-term security, passive income, or generational wealth, Saturn and Neptune are saying “Now.” The only requirement is that you stop being shy about wanting abundance. You’re meant to have more.</p>



<p>The energy shifts dramatically in the second half of the year with Jupiter entering Leo on June 30th and the August 12th Solar Eclipse in Leo, both activating your spirituality, closure, and subconscious sector. This may seem confusing at first… just when you’re gaining confidence, the cosmos asks you to go inward again. But this is essential.</p>



<p>Jupiter in Leo illuminates where your ego, fear of judgment, or longing for external validation may have been steering your financial decisions. Are you pursuing something because it looks good on paper, or because your soul wants it? Are you chasing visibility, or peace? The Leo eclipse encourages a deep reinvention of your motivations. If your money goals are rooted in self-love rather than proving yourself, then the abundance that comes in the second half of 2026 will feel effortless. If they’re rooted in comparison or insecurity, the universe will gently redirect you back to your inner truth. This is a heart-centered recalibration.</p>



<p>And then comes the biggest plot twist: Uranus enters Gemini on July 7th, activating your career sector for more than seven years. If you’ve been craving change, creativity, or a career that feels alive… buckle up. Uranus brings unpredictability, yes, but also genius breakthroughs, unexpected opportunities, nonlinear trajectories, and reinventions you didn’t even know you wanted. You may get multiple offers at once, switch industries, take on roles you never imagined, or build a career path with no precedent. For a Virgo, this can feel like a nervous-system roller coaster, but in truth, it’s the liberation you’ve been quietly praying for. You’ve been bored. You’ve been ready for more. Now “more” arrives in the form of surprise. If you treat 2026 like an adventure instead of a test, you will discover new income avenues you never would’ve considered. This year is not about control, it’s about trust. And deep down, Virgo, you are more ready than you realize.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828726.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Libra, 2026 is the year your relationships become your greatest financial portal. With Saturn and Neptune in Aries in your partnership, collaboration, and contract sector, you’re entering a long-term cycle where your abundance is directly tied to who you build with, who you trust, and who you choose to walk beside. Saturn will be here for two years, refining your standards, boundaries, and commitments. Neptune will remain for over a decade, helping you attract soul-aligned collaborators, clients, partners, and supporters.</p>



<p>Some Libras may literally <em>marry into wealth</em>, join forces with a romantic partner financially, start a business with someone, or find that the right professional ally completely transforms their income. Others will discover that setting boundaries in draining partnerships instantly shifts their money flow. You’re learning that relationships are not just emotional ecosystems… they’re also energetic and financial ones. When your partnerships are aligned, your wealth expands.</p>



<p>At the same time, Scorpio energy becomes a quiet but powerful money-making ally this year. Any Scorpio transit — Scorpio Moon days, Mercury in Scorpio, Venus in Scorpio, Mars in Scorpio, and of course Scorpio Season — activates your income and self-worth sector. Translation: Q4 may be your strongest financial quarter of the year, even if the first two or three feel more preparatory. But before the rewards arrive, you must move through the final initiation of Uranus in Taurus, which stays at 29 degrees until July 7th.</p>



<p>Uranus has been shaking your shared resources, inheritances, debt, grants, loans, investments, and generational wealth sector since 2018, bringing wild fluctuations, unexpected payments, unpredictable expenses, financial awakenings, and deep fears to the surface. These final months are the “exam” phase: releasing scarcity programming, renegotiating debt, restructuring financial agreements, letting go of survival mode, and stabilizing your money foundation. Once Uranus leaves Taurus, the turbulence stops. But you must consciously close the chapter.</p>



<p>On July 7th, Uranus enters Gemini, activating your expansion, publishing, travel, and higher learning sector, and suddenly, life becomes wide again. Uranus in Gemini is an Air sign blessing, giving you wings. After years of financial shadow work, you finally feel energized enough to travel, study, teach, write, publish, relocate, return to school, or broadcast your ideas. And here’s the magic: these expansion moves directly increase your wealth. Courses you take pay off. Content you publish brings opportunities.</p>



<p>Traveling puts you in rooms with people who hire or invest in you. Teaching, writing, lecturing, coaching, creating, or launching digital products becomes profitable. But there’s a shadow: Gemini energy can overwhelm you with options. You might say yes to too many opportunities, overbook yourself, take on too many subscriptions, or accidentally live beyond your means because life finally feels exciting again. You’ll have to practice discernment — something you’re capable of, but only when they slow down.</p>



<p>And then the glow arrives. Jupiter enters Leo on June 30th, followed by the New Moon Solar Eclipse in Leo on August 12th, activating your friendship, tech, and community sector for 13 months. This is one of the luckiest transit combos Libras have had in years. Your social circle expands, your online presence grows, and friendships bring financial opportunities. Networking becomes natural during this transit and your content is more likely to go viral.</p>



<p>The second half of 2026 is overflowing with invitations, ideas, and possibilities…almost too many. Your task is to choose the few that actually align with your values, bandwidth, budget, and long-term vision. Libra’s financial superpower this year is selectivity. The life hack: <em>sometimes less is more.</em> Ground yourself during the Earth seasons (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) to stay anchored while the Air and Fire energies sweep you into expansion. If you protect your peace, honor your limits, and trust your intuition, 2026 becomes the year your partnerships elevate you into a completely new income bracket.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828727.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Scorpio, 2026 is the year you come back to life with fire in your eyes. After Neptune and Saturn spent the past few years in Pisces activating your pleasure and romance sector, you were deep in emotional renovation mode: healing wounds, shedding karmic spending patterns, dissolving creative blocks, and confronting the extremes you sometimes swing between (either clutching onto every penny or impulse-spending like money grows on Pluto). But this year is a Fire Horse year, a numerology 1 year, and Saturn and Neptune move into Aries, activating your sector of work, routine, health, and daily mastery. Aries is ruled by Mars, your planetary ruler. This is a cosmic caffeine shot to your system.</p>



<p>Saturn gives discipline. Neptune gives vision. Together, they pull you out of your hibernation and say: <em>“It’s time.”</em> Time to work differently, lead differently, earn differently, and show up in a way that aligns with your highest self. Your financial growth this year comes directly from acting more like an Aries: bold, unapologetic, experimental, and willing to try again even if you change your mind. No more hiding.</p>



<p>No more waiting until you feel “ready.” The universe wants you moving — imperfectly, passionately, consistently. The year opens with a massive turning point: the March 3rd Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo, an ascension gateway occurring in your community, collaboration, and networking sector. This eclipse reveals how much wealth is tied not just to what you do, but who you do it <em>with</em>. Scorpio is often fiercely independent, but this eclipse makes it undeniable: community is currency. Digital workshops, in-person retreats, healing circles, online courses, speaking opportunities, group programs, co-led offerings — these are your gold mines. People want to learn from you and be guided by you.</p>



<p>People trust your insight, your leadership, your spiritual authority. As you invest in nurturing community, you’ll notice a direct increase in income. And only one week later, Jupiter stations direct in Cancer on March 10th, activating your expansion, entrepreneurship, media, and travel sector. From March through June 30th, entrepreneurial ventures stabilize. Educational projects gain traction. Publishing, teaching, writing, creating online content, or running your own business from home all become surprisingly lucrative.</p>



<p>The May 1st Full Moon in Scorpio is your personal wake-up call: a moment of “Okay…I’m done blocking my own blessings.” This full moon activates your identity and purpose, pushing you to embrace your brilliance instead of hiding it out of fear or perfectionism. Then, on June 30th, Jupiter enters Leo for 13 months, and your career becomes the hottest, brightest zone of your chart. Jupiter in Leo demands visibility: public roles, leadership positions, creative projects, management responsibilities, bold new titles, and industry recognition.</p>



<p>And the August 12th New Moon Total Solar Eclipse in Leo only amplifies this. Within six months of this eclipse, many Scorpios hit a major milestone: launching a dream project, getting promoted, going viral, receiving funding, or reinventing their public identity entirely. It’s a fiery, high-stakes, high-reward era — and yes, it can feel overwhelming after years of softness and introspection. But you asked for transformation. You asked for momentum. And now the universe is delivering it at full force.</p>



<p>The final act of the year brings both shadow and reward. On October 3rd, Venus retrogrades in your sign, temporarily slowing your money flow so you can examine your deeper relationship with receiving. Scorpio is a master giver but can struggle with letting abundance in without suspicion, fear, or guilt. Venus retrograde helps you soften those defenses. Then, on November 13th, Venus shifts direct, just in time for Sag Season to activate your money sector. This is your harvest period. Everything you built during the first half of the year, everything you stabilized during Jupiter’s shift direct in Cancer, everything you dared to reveal under the Leo eclipse… comes back to you multiplied.</p>



<p>By the end of 2026, you understand that sustainable wealth is built like Scorpio magic itself: through devotion, depth, passion, and repeated practice. Saturn and Neptune in Aries remind you that showing up consistently is what creates prosperity. This isn’t the year you hide your power… this is the year you <em>own</em> it. The year your work becomes aligned, your confidence becomes unshakeable, and your abundance becomes inevitable.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828728.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Sagittarius, 2026 feels like finally running at full speed after years of feeling like you were jogging through molasses. Saturn and Neptune are joining forces in Aries — a Fire sign like you — during a Fire Horse year, a numerology 1 year, and you’re <em>literally</em> a centaur. This is cosmic power stacking. Saturn gives you the discipline to harness your fire, and Neptune gives you the vision to direct it with purpose. Aries energy ignites your creativity, courage, entrepreneurial sparks, and willingness to take action instead of waiting for “the perfect moment.” This is a year of unapologetic momentum for you. You’re thinking bigger, taking risks, and betting on yourself. And unlike the past few years when timing felt off or the universe seemed to slow you down, 2026 finally puts wind behind your arrows. You’re being pushed into your next era of financial mastery… not through force, but through fiery alignment.</p>



<p>Before the explosion of opportunity arrives, the first six months come with an intimate, profound money lesson. Your ruler Jupiter is in Cancer, activating your shared resources, intimacy, and generational wealth sector. This is about the inner healing that allows you to truly hold abundance. Jupiter here helps you release fears around inconsistency, past financial wounds, and patterns of overgiving or undercharging. You may restructure debt, renegotiate financial partnerships, or become more intentional with investing and long-term planning.</p>



<p>The year’s visionary turning point arrives early: the February 17th New Moon Solar Eclipse in Aquarius, activating your communication, ideas, voice, and values sector. This eclipse, combined with Pluto in Aquarius, is your radicalization era — in the best way. It asks you to stop watering down your truth in order to be palatable. Your money this year is tied to how boldly, honestly, and rebelliously you express your values.</p>



<p>Sagittarius is already known for truth-telling, but in 2026, your authenticity becomes your brand. Whether you’re pitching a business, creating content, speaking publicly, or negotiating your worth, the more you show up in your realness, the more the universe aligns opportunities that match who you <em>actually</em> are. This eclipse sets off a six-month storyline of breakthrough communication, but because the Aquarius eclipse cycle continues into 2027, the values you claim now will become the foundation of your long-term financial path. And the June 29th Full Moon in Capricorn — in your income sector — brings the mid-year payout you’ve been building toward quietly. Something slow, steady, and grown-up you’ve been working on finally pays off.</p>



<p>And when Jupiter enters Leo on June 30th for a 13-month cycle, everything changes. This activates your expansion, travel, entrepreneurship, and publishing sector — your home turf. Suddenly, the world opens up. You feel bolder, brighter, and more willing to put yourself out there. Asking for more money becomes easier. Accepting leadership roles becomes natural. You stop settling for anything that undervalues your skills, your brilliance, or your range. Jupiter in Leo turns you into the version of yourself who says:“If I desire it, why can’t I have it?”</p>



<p>The second half of the year is fiery and fast thanks to Jupiter in Leo, but with fire comes temptation: burnout, overcommitment, overspending, or chasing external validation disguised as success. Capricorn Season arrives like a grounded exhale. Starting in late December 2026 — after Venus retrograde shadow periods have cleared and eclipse intensity settles — you gain clarity on what truly matters. Capricorn energy helps you refine your systems, budget with intention, streamline your workload, and realize that you don’t need to do the absolute most to earn the absolute most. Sagittarius often equates “more effort” with “more outcome,” but 2026 teaches you the opposite: less is more. Rest is strategy. Alignment is efficiency. The universe is saying: <em>You can chill and still be blessed.</em> The end of the year is where you recognize that your abundance grows when your actions are values-led rather than validation-led. And that shift is what makes 2026 one of your most transformative financial years to date.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828729.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Capricorn… 2026 is a year of profound recalibration — the kind that only happens when your chart ruler shifts signs. Saturn, your cosmic boss and anchor, leaves Pisces and enters Aries, activating your sector of roots and values. Saturn stays here for two years, while Neptune joins for over a decade, blending practicality with visionary intuition. This is a major energetic shift: Pisces had you drifting, dissolving, dreaming, healing, grieving, and letting go. Aries puts fire back in your system. Suddenly there’s urgency, clarity, initiative, and a desire to rebuild your foundation with a different level of intentionality.</p>



<p>With Saturn in Aries, you stop procrastinating. You stop tolerating mediocrity (internally or externally). You begin building new habits that are actually sustainable. And Neptune helps you lead with inspiration rather than obligation. It’s a “reconstruct your life from the ground up” year — not from fear or scarcity, but because you’ve outgrown the old version of yourself.</p>



<p>The first major turning point arrives early: the February 17th New Moon Solar Eclipse in Aquarius, activating your income sector — the start of a brand-new eclipse cycle that continues for the next two years. And with Pluto in Aquarius now settled in your money zone for nearly 20 years, your entire financial philosophy is transforming. This is the year you stop relying solely on traditional, linear, “safe” routes to wealth. Aquarius wants innovation, disruption, experimentation. Think: New currency, new tools, new industries, new ways of earning and thinking.</p>



<p>You may surprise yourself by wanting to invest in cryptocurrency, explore stocks and bonds, back someone’s startup, join an accelerator, pivot careers, learn coding, adopt AI tools, or build a digital asset you never thought you’d feel comfortable with. Aquarius energy activates your inner strategist <em>and</em> your inner rebel. And the eclipse may force your hand by dissolving an outdated income source or revealing something misaligned. The universe is saying: “The old structure won’t sustain you anymore — build the new one.”</p>



<p>Then comes the shift you’ve both dreaded and needed: Uranus leaves Taurus on July 7th, ending eight years of unpredictable, karmic lessons in love, pleasure, fate, and creative purpose. That transit shook your sense of identity, security, romantic patterns, and artistic voice. But when Uranus enters Gemini, it activates your work, service, and routine sector for the next 7-plus years. Your daily life becomes more flexible, surprising, unconventional, and mentally stimulating. Your income may come from multiple streams instead of one stable source. Work hours may shift, job roles evolve, and your relationship with consistency changes entirely. This can feel disorienting at first… as you love stability, but Uranus also opens your world. With Uranus in Gemini, you’re invited to align your money mindset with your curiosity instead of duty. It’s a cosmic permission slip to loosen your grip.</p>



<p>For the first six months, Jupiter is in Cancer — boosting your partnerships and professional alliances. Money comes through people, through agreements, through teamwork, through shared visions. Then on June 30th, Jupiter enters Leo, lighting up your shared resources, investments, inheritance, loans, grant funding, venture capital, and generational wealth sector for 13 months. This is a wealth-generation portal, especially with the August 12th Leo New Moon Solar Eclipse also activating this part of your chart. If you ask for money this year, people say yes. Investors say yes. Banks say yes. Clients say yes. Collaborators say yes.</p>



<p>This is the time to pitch yourself boldly, ask for raises, negotiate salaries, restructure debt, apply for funding, or strategically expand your financial ecosystem. But the  deeper spiritual lesson is trust. In 2026 you’re learning that controlling everything doesn’t create safety… <em>alignment does</em>. When you release your need to micromanage every outcome, synchronicities multiply. When you stop gripping, blessings land easily. 2026 is the year you learn that wealth is not just a plan, it’s a divine collaboration with the universe.</p>

<h2>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Aquarius, 2026 is the year the universe hands you the mic and says, <em>“Your era starts now.”</em> The February 17th New Moon Solar Eclipse in your sign officially opens the Aquarius–Leo eclipse axis for the first time in nearly a decade, and because Pluto is in your sign for 19 more years, this isn’t just an eclipse… it’s a coronation. Your identity, your voice, your authenticity, your weirdness, your genius — <em>that</em> is your currency now. All you really have to do to attract more wealth this year is show up as yourself and keep exploring who that self is becoming.</p>



<p>But the New Moon will square Uranus in Taurus, your modern ruler, which may trigger a feeling of instability as you attempt to choose a financial path. You may not want to choose. You may want to reinvent. You may have sudden changes at work, sudden shifts in direction, sudden realizations about what no longer fits. That’s okay. This eclipse is clearing the slate so you can write a new, innovative financial script — one only an Aquarius could dream up.</p>



<p>But before the reinvention stabilizes, you must navigate the final stretch of Uranus in Taurus, which remains in your home, roots, and emotional foundation sector until July 7th. Uranus at 29° Taurus shakes the ground beneath your feet one last time: housing transitions, family dynamics shifting, unexpected changes in living arrangements, or emotional instability that makes it difficult to focus on money. The message? <em>Your home has to evolve for your wealth to evolve.</em> Create stability where you can: simplify your space, strengthen your routines, anchor your nervous system, because the external may continue to fluctuate. Once Uranus enters Gemini in July and activates your creativity, dating, and pleasure sector for 7+ years, everything changes. You stop trying to force stability through seriousness and realize your abundance is directly tied to joy. As you play more, you profit more. As you say yes to what excites your inner child, money flows in through the side door. Your ruler in a fellow Air sign feels like oxygen after eight years underwater.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Jupiter is doing major heavy lifting for your partnerships and your wealth. For the first half of the year, Jupiter in Cancer activates your work and service sector, which makes you more emotionally sensitive at work and easily overwhelmed by routines. But on June 30th, Jupiter enters Leo for 13 months, lighting up your partnership, collaboration, and connection sector. This is not a solo year. Your wealth increases when you align yourself with people who hype you up, empower you, challenge you, or amplify your voice. Whether romantic or professional, collaborations become gold mines.</p>



<p>Jupiter in Leo dissolves your lone-wolf tendencies and says, “Work with people who make you feel more confident, not less.” And the August 12th Leo New Moon Solar Eclipse seals this truth: you may meet a divine collaborator — a soulmate client, a creative partner, a romantic partner, or a benefactor — who boosts your wealth within six months. This is the first Leo eclipse in nine years, and it reactivates a deep destiny around who you share your energy, time, and resources with.</p>



<p>Then we reach the grand finale: the August 28th Pisces Full Moon Lunar Eclipse in your income sector. This is the last Pisces eclipse for years, and a culmination of intentions set around the March 18th Pisces New Moon earlier in the year, especially if you started or expanded a home-based business at that time. This eclipse could bring a major payout, your first large client, a viral moment, a grant, a raise, a royalty check, or an unexpected windfall. It’s not logical — it’s magical. Pisces eclipses bring blessings you dream of before they appear.</p>



<p>Your task in 2026 is to stop fixating on <em>how</em> money will come and start embodying the version of yourself who already has it. Wealth is not just currency; it is frequency. Gratitude, joy, ease, creativity, softness, imagination — these are your financial tools now. Make a mood board of your wealthiest self. Listen to the music they would love. Dress the way they would dress. Play the way they would play. The more you embody abundance, the more easily it finds you. 2026 is the beginning of your Pluto Era — and that means your power, your voice, and your wealth are only going up from here.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828731.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Pisces, 2026 begins with a sacred exhale. For years, you’ve had both Saturn and Neptune in your sign — a once-in-a-lifetime transit that forced you to confront your identity, your boundaries, your purpose, your fears, your softness, and your sensitivity. From 2023 to early 2026 you were reshaped, rebuilt, rebirthed. And in January and early February, as Neptune leaves Pisces on January 26th and Saturn follows on February 13th, you integrate the <em>final degree lessons</em>: emotional maturity, energetic discernment, self-worth, and spiritual clarity. The first month of the year isn’t about money at all… it’s about shedding the old version of yourself. You’re clearing illusions, releasing martyr tendencies, and renouncing the idea that you have to suffer or sacrifice to be deserving. But then February arrives, and everything changes.</p>



<p>As soon as Saturn and Neptune enter Aries, your money, self-worth, and financial stability sector lights up like a switch being flipped. Suddenly, you stop seeing money as something “worldly” or “impure,” and start seeing it as a <em>spiritual ally</em>. Pisces realizes they can be abundant, ethical, generous, and powerful — all at once. Saturn brings structure so you don’t get swept away by unrealistic optimism; Neptune brings imagination, intuition, and a deep trust that the more aligned you become, the more supported you are.</p>



<p>This combo births a new financial identity: the Pisces who invests, who saves wisely, who builds systems, who negotiates confidently, who no longer undercharges, who believes they can be a benevolent billionaire if they choose. And when Jupiter, your planetary ruler, stations direct in Cancer on March 10th, your intuitive knowing around money decisions becomes crystal clear. What felt blocked for months now starts flowing again: creative income, entrepreneurial ideas, financial momentum, and self-trust.</p>



<p>The next major shift comes mid-year when Uranus leaves Taurus and enters Gemini on July 7th. For eight years, Uranus in Taurus activated your communication and erratic spending tendencies, sometimes scattering your focus or creating unexpected financial fluctuations. Now, Uranus moves into your home, family, and domestic sector, bringing surprises: moves, relocations, home renovations, family expansions, or sudden household expenses. This requires a budget, emotional boundaries, and clear financial planning, because your generous Pisces heart could easily be pulled into rescuing family or giving beyond your means during this transit.</p>



<p>At the same time, Jupiter enters Leo on June 30th and begins a 13-month journey through your health, routine, and service sector. This is when you realize <em>wealth without</em> <em>wellness isn’t worth it.</em> 2026 asks Pisces to take their physical health seriously — movement, rest, appointments, nutrition, grounding practices. Jupiter in Leo also encourages you to hire support: a money coach, a financial planner, a mentor, or someone who can teach you the systems you never learned. You don’t have to figure everything out alone.</p>



<p>And then comes your quantum leap. The August 12th Leo New Moon Solar Eclipse invites you to commit to a new era of financial responsibility and self-respect. Then, on August 28th, the year’s final eclipse — a Pisces Full Moon Partial Lunar Eclipse — becomes your liberation moment. This eclipse reveals how you’ve been standing in your own way: holding onto past money mistakes, believing outdated narratives about scarcity, letting fear slow you down, or waiting for perfect clarity before taking action. This is your release and rebirth. By the September 26th Full Moon in Aries, you feel ready to launch something major, claim opportunities you once felt unworthy of, or receive blessings you prayed for years ago. 2026 is your financial renaissance — not because you hustle harder, but because you believe in yourself more deeply than ever before. You’re no longer rebuilding your identity… you’re expressing it, confidently, abundantly, and unapologetically.</p>

<p>I watch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/entertainment"">a lot of TV.</a> It’s my job. And in all my years of b<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/binge-watching-habit-meaning-psychology"">inge-watching shows</a> for a living, I have never seen so many viral videos of people <a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-season-3-watch-party-blue-haven-nyc-scene-report"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">gathered together in bars simultaneously yelling</a> in reaction to major TV moments than I have this year. In the age of streaming, appointment TV was back and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/love-island-usa-watch-parties-community"">watch parties were bigger</a> than ever. Whether it was <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@loveislandusa/video/7520444252002848055?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nicolandria’s Soul Ties kiss</a> (IYKYK), the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11934118/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-finale-ending-explained-review-belly"">king of yearning Conrad Fisher</a> finally getting his happily ever after, or a <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSe15yhDuu1/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">grand gesture from a gay hockey player</a> no one saw coming, TV lovers came together this year to obsess over their fave ‘ships and root for their beloved characters. And it was beautiful to witness. </p>



<p>In a year that felt endlessly chaotic and packed with horrific headlines, TV stepped up as our most reliable emotional support system. 2025 gave us shows that made us scream-text the group chat, cancel plans for<em> just one more episode</em>, and rethink everything from love, to friendship, to what counts as a satisfying finale. Whether you were into <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/07/203712/best-2000s-shows-platinum-age"">prestige dramas</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cozy-christmas-movies"">comfort watches</a>, or genre shows that completely rewired the formula, this year’s best TV did not disappoint. Below are the series that defined our screens, our moods, and cured our collective cultural brain rot.</p>



<p>These picks come straight from the watchlists (and our unhinged yet professional Slack chats) of Refinery29 editors. The criteria isn’t “high-brow only,” it’s <em>did this show fully consume us?</em> From series that demanded our full attention to reality TV that went from chaotic to comforting to culturally essential, we’re honoring the full spectrum of what great TV looks like. If it sparked a debate, delivered a meme, or made us feel something unexpectedly real, it earned its spot. </p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq8x47ky2Tw"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Pitt </a></em></strong></h2>







<p>For some reason, I was never into Grey’s Anatomy, Scrubs, ER, or any of the popular hospital dramas even during their streaming resurgences. But after everyone from family to strangers recommended watching <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11936018/the-pitt-season-2-characters-storyline-release-date"">The Pitt</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11936018/the-pitt-season-2-characters-storyline-release-date""> </a>(starring and executive-produced by ER’s very own Noah Wyle) and being bombarded with interviews of Wylie talking about how his nurse mom influenced the storyline for more accurate depictions of what it’s actually like to work in a hospital, I finally gave in. And wow, was I stunned. </p>



<p>Each of the 15 episodes represent one hour of a consecutive 15-hour emergency room shift. It’s fast-paced and chaotic but has moments of levity, and manages to dive deep into each of the doctors, nurses, and residents’ eccentricities and back stories. I found myself instantly hooked and invested into the core doctors and incoming patients, no matter how likeable, unlikeable, long, or short their storylines were. The heavy, high-strung, high-stakes series is a must-watch. But to warn you, it is certainly not a show to wind down to after a hectic day!<em> <strong>– Victoria Montalti, Senior Fashion Writer</strong></em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.peacocktv.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Love Island USA</a> </em>Season 7 </strong></h2>







<p>When an Irish friend first introduced me to <em>Love Island </em>via the show’s original UK iteration in 2022, I was equally horrified and intrigued by the sheer logistics of it all. The idea of committing to a show that airs a new episode six nights a week for two and a half months straight — featuring a revolving door of 30-or-so contestants and their constantly recalibrating romances — was a lot to wrap my head around. But, as someone who deeply appreciates lowbrow reality TV both as a form of sociological fieldwork and, obviously, for pure eye candy, I was up for the task. </p>



<p>This year, <em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hZpwgKjOkY"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Love Island USA</a></em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hZpwgKjOkY"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> season 7</a> brought the country together in ways seldom seen before, becoming a full-blown cultural phenomenon that revived the glory days of participatory reality TV. My roommate and I grew closer as we watched and voted together each night (and shrieked in horror at the show’s absolutely unhinged challenges). My colleagues and I raced to our Slack channels each morning to share hot takes. Even in New York City, where people famously mind their business, I’d find myself talking about the show with a friend on the street or subway, only to have strangers jump in mid-conversation to share their opinions.</p>



<p>What ultimately made season 7 feel like a classic was (most of) the cast’s emotional vulnerability. It gave us a hero’s arc in Amaya Papaya (née Espinal), who brought a rare level of authenticity and sensitivity to reality TV, a friends-to-star-crossed-lovers romance in Olandria and Nic, healthy debates about what it really means to be “a girls girl,” and enough memes to last a lifetime (Mamacita, anyone?). <em><strong>– Lia Tabackman, Senior Social Media Manager </strong></em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@hbomax/video/7583017214677241119"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Heated Rivalry</a></em></strong></h2>







<p>I’m going to start with a quote from <em><a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/heated-rivalry-hbo-max-gay-drama-hockey-players-hit-women-1236456083/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Heated Rilvarly’s</a></em> creator, writer and showrunner, Jacob Tierney: “Putting queer sex on the screen in a celebratory and sexy way is not common at all… people were clearly craving that kind of thing,” <a href=""https://theankler.com/p/i-think-heated-rivalry-deserves-emmys"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tierney told The Ankler</a>. “They wanted to see sexually alive, queer people in a way that we kind of self-censor and don’t always do. I don’t think the show is popular despite the horniness; I think it’s popular because of the horniness.” Exactly. Recently, TV and film have been oddly sexless, seemingly scared to show erotism on screen and convinced audiences don’t want to see pretty people kissing. I beg to differ.</p>



<p>I’ve been pushing the horny TV agenda for years and finally, here comes a show to match my freak. But it’s not just about the beautifully tender, explicit, real, and <em>hot </em>sex scenes, <em>Heated Rivalry </em>contains some of the most heartfelt and romantic storytelling I’ve ever seen on TV. And that’s only after five episodes! I am already unhealthily obsessed with this show and I can’t wait for more. As someone who belongs to multiple romance book clubs, I’m so happy that a show based on a romance novel (written by Rachel Reid) is getting the love it deserves. Plus, a show about gay hockey players airing in 2025 — when male athletes would still face so much prejudice, homophobia, and an extremely hard time if they came out IRL — is not only bold and brave, it’s revolutionary. – <em><strong>Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Senior Content Director, Entertainment </strong></em><br /></p>

<p>I admittedly didn’t watch much TV this year, but there was one show that had me in a chokehold: Season 3 of <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty.</em> To be honest, I didn’t particularly enjoy this season. As Team Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno), a lot of it was insufferable, mostly because Conrad (Christopher Briney) remains an unbearable character to watch. He’s going to talk down to Belly (Lola Tung) and make her feel crazy for years AND do his brother like that, and they still want me to believe he’s not the villain in this show? (You ain’t gaslighting me, Connie Baby!). I also couldn’t stand the way the writers seemed determined to assassinate Jeremiah’s character. Still, to paraphrase a Taylor Swift lyric, Jenny Han really puts narcotics into all of her episodes, because no matter how much I wanted to look away, I just couldn’t. <em>– <strong>Raquel Reichard, Director of Somos</strong></em></p>

<p>When I first started <em>The Hunting Wives</em>, I wasn’t prepared for what I signed up for. I assumed I would be watching a show about wives getting back at their cheating husbands. I was right, but also so wrong. I spent most of the time being mad at the main character Sophie (Brittany Snow), literally rolling my eyes at the screen at her antics. That said, I will be back for Season 2. –<em> <strong>Dawnie Jefferson Production &amp; Editorial Coordinator</strong></em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/secretlivesonhulu/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives </a></em></strong></h2>







<p><em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSky3regZqi/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives</a> </em>was my favorite TV show of 2025 because it didn’t just understand the assignment, it overdelivered. TWO seasons in one year? Bravo could never. By breaking the fourth wall and letting the off-screen drama (hello, Fruity Pebbles) bleed into the show, it captured the same raw magic as early Vanderpump Rules seasons, back when the cast wanted fame at any cost and didn’t know, or care, to hold anything back.</p>



<p>Season 3 was filmed before Season 2 even premiered, giving us something almost unheard of in reality TV: reunions being taped, press tours unfolding, and cast dynamics shifting in real time as they reacted to public opinion. The timeline was messy, but for reality fans, that level of transparency was all we’ve ever wanted.</p>



<p>We watched marriages implode, secret affairs surface, and learned way too much about their sex lives. Not every storyline worked (the sexual assault allegations were uncomfortable and difficult to watch), but the drama was balanced by something real: raw, unprocessed trauma shared in a way that genuinely resonated.</p>



<p>Taylor Frankie Paul becoming the Bachelorette only cemented the show’s chokehold on pop culture, while Whitney Leavitt started the year as the ultimate villain and ended it as the main character of<em> Dancing with the Stars </em>and getting cast as Roxie Hart on Broadway. The range! And all of this unfolded in the hyper-specific, endlessly fascinating playground of Swig sodas, Utah curls, and Mormon culture—proof that you don’t need alcohol for reality TV gold.<em> – <strong>Taylor Loren, Social Strategist </strong></em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/81418639"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Forever</a> </em></strong></h2>







<p>Mara Brock Akil’s <em>Forever</em> feels like it was made specifically for me — for the 16 year old version of me who needed to see herself, who longed for stories that reflected Black girlhood and humanity and the complexity of being a Black kid in a white space — and that’s only partially why I loved it so much. For the teenager in me who was messily figuring out her sexuality, Keisha and Justin would have been my fictional best friends. For the thirty-redacted grownup who needed an escape and just loves romance, <em>Forever</em> delivered in-depth, nuanced explorations of how sex can be absolutely everything and sometimes nothing at all. </p>



<p>Listen, I’m too grown to believe that representation will save us, but it does matter. And what this show represents (Black kids falling in love and finding themselves) is portrayed in such a caring, thoughtful way that as you fall in love with Keisha and Justin, as a Black person, you can’t help but love yourself more. This show loves us. It finds beauty in Blackness, in the nuances and flaws of youth. It lets Keisha be complicated and messy and Justin be introspective and vulnerable; two things that Black girls and boys aren’t typically allowed to be on TV. This show is my wildest dreams come true. It’s the show I wish I had when I was a teenager and I’m so grateful that Black teens get this show now. <strong>– </strong><em><strong>Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Senior Content Director, Entertainment </strong></em><br /></p>

<p><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/01/10828529/abbott-elementary-show-review-quinta-brunson"">Abbott Elementary</a></em> is my comfort show when I want to just laugh and <em>not have to think</em>. I can usually jump into any episode in the season or binge several of the 22-minute episodes and still understand what’s happening. In the same style as cult-favorite comedies like<em> The Office</em> and <em>Parks &amp; Rec,</em> this workplace “mockumentary” follows the staff of a Philadelphia elementary school and captures all the drama and antics you’d expect to happen during everyday life—in and out of school. The show is currently in the middle of season five and we see teachers Janine and Gregory’s relationship continue to develop. A few of the recent episodes have taken the setting out of the school, but my favorites are usually when the teachers and staff, especially Principal Ava Coleman and teacher Ms. Melissa Schementti, are just trying to get through the school day. For me, it’s easy sitcom watching. <strong>–</strong><em><strong> Lisa Dionisio, Newsletter Director</strong></em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/81427733"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Beast In Me</a></em></strong></h2>







<p>If I were putting together a dream team of prestige TV, I would immediately call up Claire Danes and Matthew Rhys for my starting five. Danes proved in <em>Homeland</em>, and throughout her storied career, that she can do a chin quiver like no other, and that there is no emotion she can’t convey through the careful crumpling of her face. And Rhys, along with his real-life wife Keri Russell, showed on <em>The Americans</em> that he can make even the most ethically-questionable character someone you can’t help but be intrigued by. In <em>The Beast In Me</em>, these two heavyweights come together for some of the best TV of the year. </p>



<p>Both Danes and Rhys are so compelling in <em>The Beast In Me, </em>you won’t be able to look away for all eight episodes. Danes brings her signature emotional precision, playing every flicker of doubt and defiance like a controlled burn, while Rhys does what he does best: make moral ambiguity feel devastatingly human. Together, they create a push-pull dynamic that’s an unsettling dissertation on good versus evil and what happens when the lines between the two start to blue. Their chemistry isn’t flashy; it’s claustrophobic, simmering, and kind that makes silence feel louder than dialogue and turns every shared glance into a threat. It’s prestige acting without the self-importance, and it’s exactly why the show gets under your skin and stays there. – <em><strong>Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Senior Content Director, Entertainment </strong></em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaDFty5ipEg"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Buccanneers</a> </em>Season 2</strong></h2>







<p>This past summer, I was indulging in some YA love-triangle drama and watching <em>TSITP</em> and<em> The Buccaneers</em> Season 2 on Apple TV. If you’re not familiar with The Buccaneers, it’s a period drama set in 1870s England following five gorgeous American women trying to find titled husbands and independence. Season 2 tries to resolve a love triangle set up in Season 1 between Nan, Guy, and Theo. New affairs and betrayals between the couples develop, and it’s guilty-pleasure watching, especially for period romance fans. Spoiler warning: season two ends in another cliffhanger but the show’s already been greenlit for a season three.<em> <strong>– Lisa Dionisio, Newsletter Director</strong></em></p>

<p>I know Tubi gets a bad rep for its content, but do NOT sleep on them. I loved everything about the Z Suite! The characters were fun. The plots were full of shenanigans. It fueled the Gen Z vs. Millennial fire in a way that leaves you with the idea, “we are more alike than different”. It had a sense of true comedic whimsy, while many other shows are just too serious. I am unsure if it will be renewed for another season, but I sure hope so! –<em> <strong>Dawnie Jefferson Production &amp; Editorial Coordinator</strong></em></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jan/28/paradise-review-disney-a-whodunnit-with-wit-heart-and-sterling-k-brown""><em>Paradise</em></a> is a mystery series starring Emmy winner Sterling K. Brown about a secret service agent whose president is murdered and it’s so good, it got renewed for a <a href=""https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/a64208545/paradise-season-2-news-date-cast-spoilers/"">second season</a> halfway into its first. So I’m just going to quote myself from March writing about <em>Paradise</em> just after it was renewed: “We’re in an age where a show with a Black lead gets written off by online trolls as ‘<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/02/11253627/woke-meaning-co-opted-politics"">too woke</a>’ or full of ‘<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/03/11844306/hollywood-dei-rollbacks-black-actors-cast-reboots-racism"">DEI hires</a>’ and anything that makes us feel our feelings gets denigrated as ‘silly.’ But the absurdity and sincerity of <em>Paradise</em> is its strength. And its hero? A Black man, the descendent of a Tuskegee airman and Black pilot, who took a bullet for the president, may feel a bit too nationalistic for the current moment, but it also harkens back to a time when that guy was the hero everyone welcomed, and the one TV wanted. Right now, Sterling K. Brown as Xavier Collins is the hero we need.” – <em><strong>Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Senior Content Director, Entertainment </strong></em></p>

<p>This year marked Season 4 and 5 of <em>Ghosts</em>, and it is consistently one of my favorite comfort watches. I literally force anyone who comes to my house to watch it with me. Season 4 gave the characters so much more backstory. Season 5 adds to that. If you want a good, wholesome chuckle, you should definitely watch this show. –<em> <strong>Dawnie Jefferson Production &amp; Editorial Coordinator</strong></em></p>

<p>Winter jackets are practical, but the best ones aren’t a supporting act — they’re the main character, serving as <em>the</em> outfit. That’s why we’re all about layering up in outerwear that delivers warmth and <em>wow</em> factor. Whether you’re leaning into the coziness of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-faux-fur-coats-jackets"">faux-fur coat</a> or the versatility of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/womens-fall-jackets"">trench coat</a>, the right winter topper can transform even the simplest look into a moment. <br /><br />This season, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-fashion-beauty-trends-forecast-2025-2026"">top winter trends</a> point towards bold plaids (or even more dramatic checks), animal print (yes, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-leopard-print-2"">leopard print</a> is always in fashion), and winter whites (to channel Pantone’s Color of the Year: Cloud Dancer). And for silhouettes, it’s time to pull out your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cape-coats-jackets-trend"">scarf jackets</a> from a couple seasons back (or invest in a new one) and bundle up in funnel-neck designs (that don’t require a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/oversized-scarf"">chunky scarf</a>). <br /><br />Whether you’re looking for an elevated coat to wear over <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-wedding-guest-dresses-outfits"">winter wedding guest dresses</a> or a cozy cropped jacket to pair with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-matching-sweatsuits-womens"">lounge sets</a>, you can brave the cold in style and ring in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-years-eve-nail-art-designs"">the new year</a> with a trendy winter coat. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Plaid Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952061.png?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The winter calls for festive plaids, especially on your outerwear. This season, the closet mainstay is refreshed with punchier colors and unexpected silhouettes. Think: vibrant color combos, blazers, and bomber jackets. We’re especially eyeing reversible jacket designs that can transform with different outfits and seasons. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Scarf Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952078.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>It seems like every It-girl on our feeds and on the streets is wearing a scarf coat. The bundled-up silhouette trended a couple years back — briefly overtaken by the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cape-coats-jackets-trend"">cape jacket</a> — and is back at the forefront. Wear the scarves loosely hanging down or wrapped snugly around your neck (and look out for versatile coats with detachable scarves). </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Winter White Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952100.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>A winter essential that’s equal parts cozy and cool, a white coat should be in your closet (or in your shopping cart), especially thanks to Pantone’s Cloud Dancer color and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hm-perfect-moment-collaboration"">après-ski aesthetic</a>. The best part is that you can go down any route, from sporty <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-puffer-jacket"">puffer jackets</a> and wool cropped coats to faux fur zip-ups and wrap trenches.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Funnel Neck Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952122.png?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Funnel neck coats are one of those <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2025-trends"">runway trends</a> that are <em>actually</em> wearable IRL. The exaggerated high necks aren’t just dramatic, they’re also practical for keeping the wind and snow from ruining your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-makeup-looks"">winter makeup looks</a>. You can find the trendy silhouette across leather jackets, wool dress coats, and even longline vests.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Animal Print Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952143.png?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>Nothing says winter glamour like a faux-fur coat. And an <em>animal print</em> faux-fur coat is an even more bold and playful option. While you can’t go wrong with classic leopards and cheetahs, more unexpected animal prints — like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-cow-print"">cow</a>, zebra, deer, giraffe, and even snow leopard — are trending. (And be sure to also look out for non-furry fabrics that can be worn cross-seasonally.)</p>

<p>It’s 2010. I’m 13 years old and I’m on my way to what I <em>know</em> will be one of the craziest nights of my life: <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/justin-bieber-announces-my-world-tour-first-headlining-trek-958949/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Justin Bieber </a><em><a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/justin-bieber-announces-my-world-tour-first-headlining-trek-958949/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">My World 2.0</a></em><a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/justin-bieber-announces-my-world-tour-first-headlining-trek-958949/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> Tour.</a> As I crank my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-hair-straightening-tools"">hair straightener</a> up way too high (RIP to my ends), I pause mid-section and wonder: <em>What am I missing? What would truly make Justin fall in love with me? </em>And then it hits me: my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/favorite-perfumes-editors-picks"">vanilla cupcake perfume</a> from Claire’s.</p>



<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fragrance"">perfume is aggressively sugary</a> and smells like straight icing. All my mom could hear from downstairs was <em>sksksksksks</em> as I drowned myself in it, fully convinced that if Justin couldn’t see me from the stage, he would at least smell me. And well, not to spoil the ending, but… he did not fall in love with me that night. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2018/11/217863/justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-marriage-confirmed"">Congrats, Hailey</a>!</p>



<p>What <em>did</em> happen, though, was far more consequential: that was the night I fell in love with gourmand fragrances, specifically, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-7-virtues-vanilla-woods-perfume-fragrance-review"">vanilla</a>. I never cared what brand it was, as long as the bottle starts with <em>buttery</em>, <em>whipped</em>, or <em>sugar</em>, I was in.</p>



<p>Life was going great until one day, a coworker casually mentions that my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/perfume-fragrance-editor-favorites"">favorite fragrance</a> reminds her of what it smells like to be a child. Suddenly, I was overthinking everything. Was I still that 13-year-old hoping to be noticed by JB, or did my signature scent simply need a rebrand?</p>



<p>Turns out, it was both.</p>



<p>When I heard that <a href=""https://thesoapandglory.com/""><strong>Soap &amp; Glory</strong></a> dropped a brand-new, mood-boosting fragrance line, I was intrigued. It covers pretty much every palette. There’s <a href=""https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/soap-%26-glory-body-mist-tropical-sunrise/ID=300462740-product""><strong>Tropical Sunrise</strong></a> with pineapple and coconut, <a href=""https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/soap-%26-glory-body-mist-orchid-bliss/ID=300462734-product""><strong>Orchid Bliss</strong></a> with orchid and sandalwood, <a href=""http://walgreens.com/store/c/soap-%26-glory-body-mist-radiant-rose/ID=300462747-product""><strong>Radiant Rose</strong></a> with florals and bergamot, <a href=""https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/soap-%26-glory-body-mist-watermelon-spritz/ID=300462746-product""><strong>Watermelon Spritz</strong></a> for something bright and juicy, and of course <a href=""https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/soap-%26-glory-body-mist-vanilla-licious/ID=300462744-product""><strong>Vanilla-licious</strong></a> with warm caramel and vanilla notes. With a set with this much range, it’s perfect for mixing and matching. And with each fragrance under $20, it felt like the perfect chance to find my signature scent and actually play around with layering.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952221.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=491&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A491"" /></figure>



<p>Since I hadn’t elevated my fragrance in nearly 20 years, I tapped the internet’s favorite fragrance guru, <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@paulreactss?lang=en""><strong>Paul Fino</strong></a>, for advice on how to layer scents and whether I can keep being a vanilla girl at my big age. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<p><strong>Unbothered: So talk to me about vanilla. Do you think it’s having a moment right now? And do you think it’s one of those scents that transcends seasons, like a year-round thing?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Fino:</strong> Yeah, for sure. Vanilla is year-round for me because there are so many vanilla-adjacent scents. You can find vanillas that lean super creamy, more floral, or even more powdery. That said, vanilla is definitely most popular in fall and winter. People love warm gourmands in colder months, and in summer they usually want something more tropical, fruity, or fresh. But vanilla is not going anywhere. It’s had its moment and it’s become one of those things that just sticks around.</p>



<p><strong>My coworker said vanilla is childish. So when you see something like Vanilla-licious, which feels more grown and sexy but still has that inner-child sweetness, how do you elevate it? How do you layer it so you don’t smell like cupcake perfume from Limited Too?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> I 100% get that. A lot of gourmand vanillas can lean artificial or very young. When people say they want a “mature” vanilla, I get it, but “mature” doesn’t mean grandma. It can mean deeper, sexier, more attractive. One of my favorite ways to elevate Vanilla-licious is pairing it with Radiant Rose. Radiant Rose is basically their iconic signature scent, but repackaged and made a little newer and fresher. Rose is romantic, and it deepens the vanilla. The musk in both helps them blend really beautifully. That vanilla-rose combination is gorgeous.</p>



<p><strong>I feel like layering fragrance is like cooking. You wouldn’t put mustard and jelly together. So how do you know what works? What’s the science of scent layering, especially for someone new who wants to smell unique but still wearable?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> It’s all about understanding notes and scent families. I can usually predict how something will smell based on the notes and how many fragrances I’ve experienced, but a simple rule is to keep things in similar scent profiles if you want to play it safe. Sweets with sweets, gourmands with gourmands. For example, vanilla with pineapple and coconut makes sense because it’s tropical sweet. Vanilla and coconut always work together, so Vanilla-licious with Tropical Sunrise is an easy layering combo.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952222.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p><strong>What about combinations that are risky?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> Sometimes mixing two different ends of the spectrum can clash, but sometimes a clash is exactly what makes it interesting. That’s how you get people to ask, “What are you wearing?” Also, fragrance wears differently on everyone, so experimentation matters.</p>



<p><strong>Are these meant to be layered only with each other, or can you layer them with perfumes too?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> You can absolutely layer these with perfumes. They’re body mists, but they have really good projection and longevity, especially for the price point. They’re great as base layers.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have a method for layering? Like an order you follow?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong>Yes. I do heaviest to lightest. I start with my deepest scent first, like a heavy wood or musk, then layer lighter scents on top. It’s kind of like how fragrance is built, with base notes, heart notes, and top notes.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952224.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>If someone just wants one scent from the line for self-care, like a shower that makes you feel calm and relaxed, which one is it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> Orchid Bliss. Hands down. If you want truly relaxing and calming, Orchid Bliss is the one. It’s slightly sweet, it has sandalwood, and there are also notes like vanilla and pistachio in there, but they feel more subtle and deeper in the background. It’s like a spa in a bottle.</p>



<p><strong>Why not Vanilla-licious for calm?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> Vanilla makes me feel confident. Like, super confident. Orchid Bliss gives more calm spa-night energy. If you’re tired, overworked, and want the most relaxing shower, I’d do scrub, wash, body butter, and spray in Orchid Bliss, then top it with your favorite perfume if you want extra oomph.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<p>After talking to Paul, I realized it was never really about retiring vanilla. It was about wearing it with intention. It was about keeping the sweetness but adding depth. It’s time to let my inner 13-year-old have her moment, while my grown self makes my scent feel polished. So yes, I’m still a vanilla girl. I’m just a vanilla girl with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/best-vanilla-perfume""><em>range</em></a> now.</p>

<p><em>Music journalist Kelly Washington travelled to Pacha ICONS at Playa Pacha at the FIVE LUXE JBR to profile <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/peggygou_/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Peggy Gou</a>, the queen of K-House and techno. </em></p>



<p>It is around midnight at the Playa Pacha Pool and Beach Club at <a href=""https://luxejbr.fivehotelsandresorts.com/"">FIVE LUXE JBR in Dubai</a>. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/gerdjansonofficial/?hl=en"">German DJ Gerd Janson</a> has just dropped a remix of Stevie Nick’s “Edge Of Seventeen” when <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/article/dj-peggy-gou-interview"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Peggy Gou</a> appears next to him, diamond-clad in a <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/q_millinery/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Q Park Millinery</a> sparkly bandana, with a cat on the front reading “Mew Mew,” paired with a black two-piece. I am standing behind the decks, watching her slink into the space with her entourage, as the crowd reacts to her presence. Someone next to me breathlessly exclaims “queen”, in a way that seems involuntarily. As the crowd howls in unison and Gou clasps their hands, I am struck by how comfortable she looks.</p>



<p>It is hard to believe that once upon a time, Gou was just starting out in the underground scene; she seems as if she was plonked down on earth, already a successful 34-year-old, with her knowing, winning smile and covered in patchwork tattoos, cigarette in one hand, tending to the decks with the other. The ‘female DJ’ as an archetype has gone through many iterations, but never before has she propelled herself into mainstream stardom the way Peggy Gou has. In a short space of time, she achieved global fame, headlined major festivals like Coachella and Glastonbury, created global hits like “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCz5y84dwuA"">(It Goes Like) Nanana,</a>” and became the first Korean to play the <a href=""https://www.papermag.com/berghain-linux"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">world-renowned legacy club Berghain.</a> </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952202.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>FIVE LUXE JBR is flooded with Brits escaping the December chill at home, as well as Americans, Russians, and other European clientele. Backed by the hotel’s luxury ecosystem project, the FIVE LUXE JBR has a “do more with less” ethos and is 100% solar powered, making it the world’s highest-rated 5-Star Hotel green building under LEED v4 (the international standard for high-performance green buildings). FIVE’s service is the best I’ve ever experienced (even my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/winter-clothes-accessories-2025#slide-8"">battered Vagabond handbag</a> gets its own seat at every table), and I’m grateful I packed my <a href=""https://www.loopearplugs.com/products/swarovski"">Swarovski Loop ear plugs</a> (the only sparkly thing I own) so I just about fit in with the bold and flash crowd.</p>



<p>I ask Peggy to describe Dubai’s club scene in three words, to which she enthusiastically responds “energetic, diverse and growing!” Considering a huge 90% of the population are expats, she’s not wrong. <a href=""https://palmjumeirah.fivehotelsandresorts.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">FIVE Palm Jumeirah</a> (also in Dubai) even boasts its own recording studio and it’s clear the team has set their sights on Dubai as their next ultimate party destination. They clearly have the cash, and they’re spending it on the best talent money can buy; hosting the likes of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/carlcoxofficial/?hl=en"">Carl Cox</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/marcocarola/?hl=en"">Marco Carola </a>and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/solomun/?hl=en"">Solomun</a> at Playa Pacha. </p>



<p>When she was 18, Peggy Gou went to study at the <a href=""https://www.arts.ac.uk/colleges/london-college-of-fashion/study-at-lcf?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22332830344&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA-G_q8pyDEQVeFZGpmfJ8Qdf3lAZE&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA9aPKBhBhEiwAyz82J0Y4h9qKJbh7cGoshAwRUZaq-07o72iJKm9Ca2eli2Uxv2PBe2o4sxoCvVEQAvD_BwE"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">London College of Fashion</a> with hopes of becoming a designer, then a photographer, then a stylist. But she’d always been passionate about music, and eventually found a way to use her skills in fashion promotion to fill a gap in electronic music. While most house and techno DJs dress understated, she knew her style would play a pivotal role in her success once she began producing music and cutting her teeth at small venues in London and Berlin. I ask her why these grassroots spaces are important right now, and her critical eye shines: “Club culture continues to influence many aspects of creative industries far beyond music. Without grassroots and independent venues, we will lose the very foundations of electronic music as we know it,” Gou says. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Without grassroots and independent venues, we will lose the very foundations of electronic music as we know it.</p><cite>dj peggy gou</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Above all, Gou is a strategic and smart producer, and is incredibly intentional about what she puts out and why. Back in July 2018, I had just finished my undergraduate degree in Manchester in the UK, and a label called Defected Records reigned supreme among most of my friends who were into house music. It was on this label that Gou released a remix of Shakedown’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbf2JR422w"">“At Night (Peggy Gou’s Acid Journey Remix)”</a> that defined the summer. As catchy, accessible and pop-fluent as the chorus was, it never seemed to get old, and hit #1 on the UK Official Dance Singles Chart. Everywhere you went, the At Night remix was playing. The pulsing vocal could be heard from Manchester, to London, to party island Ibiza, often heard in a rendition similar to that of a football chant. With this single, Gou propelled herself into the dance music world, then onto the global stage, and hasn’t slowed down since. </p>



<p>Blowing up in electronic music as a woman, can be your best and worst nightmare all at once. Overnight, you are successful, impressive, and adored. But six months later you are likely to fall victim to criticism for <em>something</em>, like being too commercial or having rich parents. Her haters will say that she sold out, that once Peggy Gou had everyone feeling <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbf2JR422w"">“much better… at night</a>”, she was no longer the underground DJ sensation who cut her teeth in clubs in London and Berlin – they’d lost her to A-list status. Charli XCX touched on this in <a href=""https://itscharlibb.substack.com/p/the-death-of-cool"">her recent substack </a>titled “The Death of Cool.” XCX wrote, “I have always rejected the idea that art, film, persona or music becoming commercial means it cannot also be considered cool. The rejection of commerciality ‘just because’ is such a boring and immature argument that is perhaps more suited to some mediums than others but in general I find to be elitist in a way that does not thrill me whatsoever,” she continued. “Disliking something purely because of its widespread popularity or links to commercialism comes with a distinctly art school type energy that is super triggering to me.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952204.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>Charli XCX is right, artists can’t take this chatter personally – just because some fans in the electronic music space have a habit of tarnishing those who rise to success quickly, especially if you’re a woman. At the same time, it is not wholly uncommon to witness legends (often male), playing what can only be described as the worst set you’ve seen in your life, on no sleep, without consequence or fallout in the scene.</p>



<p>When cool points are gained on the basis of youth and niche references, mainstream success can become the enemy in certain circles. Once something transcends the underground, it transforms into something else entirely. But Peggy never forgot her roots; a genre-blending selector with range, she’s known for her energetic but composed sets. She often plays a combination of pulsing house, techno and break beats, dropping tunes from artists like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dj_seinfeld/"">DJ Seinfeld</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/andrezimmer_/?hl=en"">Andre Zimmer,</a> as well as hosting the likes of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dmx_krew/?hl=en"">DMX Krew</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/regularfantasy/"">Regularfantasy</a> on her label. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>… this is not just focused on the fact they’re women, they’re exceptionally talented and it’s important for me to use my platform to share that with the world.</p><cite>peggy gou on mentoring other djs</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Sure, it’s inevitable that those who are successful will be criticized. Someone’s song blows up, they get big, and then we get bored until they do something else remarkable. But in this corner of entertainment, it’s silly to dismiss a DJ because of their accolades. To paint a picture, a Berlin-based journalist I met recently told me (with a straight face) that because Gou is never seen in the local pubs in Berlin, it must mean she doesn’t actually live there (she does). So let’s set the record straight, aside from electronic music’s swirling pool of cool that has a habit of eating the principles it so vehemently defends, I can confirm that Gou is touring the world, looking sensational, and most importantly very, very good at her job. </p>



<p>To get a broader picture of how she shaped her taste, I ask Gou to name an album, movie and a book that was essential in her cultural education. For her movie she selects cult classic <em>Pulp Fiction</em> (which tracks with her style), the book is Nietzsche’s <em>Ubermensch </em>(there’s that critical thinking), and a true music head, she sites Kraftwerk’s <a href=""https://music.apple.com/us/album/3-d-the-catalogue-live/1572506374"">3-D: The Catalogue (Live) </a>as the ultimate education. Gou explains how she still tries to make it down to grassroots venues, “not just as a DJ but more importantly as a raver, which I always find inspiring and cathartic.” Her dedication to a range of culture shows in the sets she plays, so I think we can forgive her for not sharing a pint with us at the local boozer.</p>

<p>In March 2019, Gou realized she wanted to own her own music and uplift other artists on the rise, so she created <em>Gudu Records</em> and released her own album titled “Moment”. A few years ago, I interviewed the<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/matisa.dj/""> Italian DJ Matisa</a>, who has released music on Peggy Gou’s label. When I asked her about her experience as a woman in the industry, she credited Gou as a brilliant mentor to herself and others in the dance music community, adding that she’s very hard working and down to earth. I ask Gou about her mission to lift up other DJs like Matisa, and she stresses the importance of not only supporting new talent via <em>Gudu</em> but also including the newcomers on her line-ups IRL, “this is not just focused on the fact they’re women, they’re exceptionally talented and it’s important for me to use my platform to share that with the world”. </p>



<p>With rising costs for venues and AI music creation causing a stir, who knows where 2026 will take electronic music. I ask Gou if she’s optimistic about where the industry is heading, in terms of building a better future for those that follow her success and she leaves me with a gem of hope that mirrors the energy she brings to the industry: “I’m optimistic for sure, but as with anything growing as fast as our industry, it won’t be without its challenges.”<br /></p>

<p>Forget tortoiseshell, leopard, and cow prints for a second — deer print is about to steal their thunder. It’s also one of the easiest prints to recreate. Tiny, deliberate white spots stretch from base to tip on a brushed brown background, creating a deer-hide effect that perfectly nods to the winter season. We love this set by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRHqxjPjZwm/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Sierra, also known as @thatglosssauce</a> on Instagram.</p>

<p>It was only a matter of time before our iced coffee obsession made its way to our nails — and this look by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRcoHkmkXYV/?hl=en"">nail tech Elizabeth</a> is nothing short of incredible. It starts with a bronze cat-eye base, manipulated with magnets to achieve a glassy finish, followed by a matte top coat. Then, fine lines are painted on top using a glossy top coat to create a striking contrast effect.</p>

<p>Just hit the Explore page on Instagram, and it’ll become clear: baby blue and chocolate brown are the unexpected color combination of 2026 — and we’re here for it. There’s a ’70s retro vibe to the pairing, but it works effortlessly. Created by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DOB6k9NCF7E/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Heather Errington</a>, this pastel blue heart layered over a molten chocolate base is so cool.</p>

<p>Taking cues from A/W runways, plaid nails are everywhere, but velvet plaid — essentially plaid layered over a velvety cat-eye base — is what’s bringing the intricate pattern into 2026. Thanks to the mix of polish finishes, the effect is beautifully multidimensional. We love this icy <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRDATgRDhWq/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">look by @nailology.101</a>.</p>
