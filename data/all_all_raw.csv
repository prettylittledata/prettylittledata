<p><em>From Restroom to Waystation</em> - In recent years, our studio has designed a series of small-scale public restrooms through various competitions and commissions. These designs have incorporated varying degrees of public functions—such as rest areas for sanitation workers, auxiliary spaces, and vending areas—continually transforming the conventional concept of restroom spaces across different contexts. For this project, the client initially requested event storage space for Luke Island. Later, owing to the restroom's favorable location, a temporary office space was incorporated as well. Thus, the public restroom has gradually evolved into a compact, multi-functional public infrastructure, continually expanding the possibilities of design.</p>",

To respect the daily rhythms of three generations and consider their different perceptions of the house, the archetype of the house was designed to foster mutual empathy, and each area of the house was subdivided to ensure the privacy of family members.    </p>",

Protected from cold north-easterly winter winds, nestling up to the forest, the aquatic park opens towards the west to make the most of cool breezes in warm weather. Looking out to the south-west, the aquatic park is bathed in light throughout the year. It is oriented so as to receive as much sunlight as possible in winter, while protecting itself from excessive exposure to the sun through its terraces in summer. Like an origami sculpture, our proposal for the aquatic park resembles an unfolding landscape, culminating at around 35m: it is a built landscape, rising into the sky. The structure is visible from the surrounding area - it becomes a point of reference and a symbol of Villages Nature. This new type of landmark contrasts with the relatively flat topography. It is not an element that has been imposed on the landscape, but an extension of the landscape itself.</p>",

<h4>The future of work in the age of AI and deepware.</h4><p>There is a photograph from 1930s East London that should be mandatory viewing for anyone anxious about AI taking their job. It shows Mary Smith, a “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knocker-up"">knocker-up</a>” — <strong>a woman whose entire profession consisted of walking the streets at dawn, shooting dried peas at bedroom windows with a long bamboo pole to wake workers for their factory shifts.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Photograph from 1930s showing Mary Smith, a “knocker-up,” wielding a bamboo pole with dried peas, shooting them at bedroom windows to wake factory workers."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*rkCJ0XioJKqdRXNE.jpg"" /><figcaption>Mary Smith, a “knocker-up” in East London (1930s)</figcaption></figure><p>Mary charged sixpence a week for this service. Then the alarm clock arrived, and Mary’s job vanished.</p><p>Do we mourn the knocker-up today? Do we rage against the tyranny of the alarm clock? Of course not. Because what happened to Mary is what has happened throughout every technological revolution: certain tasks became obsolete whilst entirely new categories of work emerged.</p><p>Yet here we are in 2025, gripped by the same ancient panic. <em>AI is coming for our jobs</em>, we are told. The robots will replace us. The future is bleak.</p><blockquote>Let me offer a different provocation: AI is not coming for your job. It is coming for your tasks. And if you cannot distinguish between the two, then yes — you should be worried.</blockquote><h3>The evolution we refuse to see</h3><p>Human work has always been in flux. In nomadic societies, we hunted and gathered. Agriculture tethered us to land and rhythms of seasons. Industrialisation moved us into factories, trading physical labour for wages. The information age shifted us again — this time from brawn to brain, from making things to managing data, information, and knowledge.</p><p>Each transition has redefined not just what we do, but what remains uniquely human about work. We moved from physical exertion to cognitive processing. Now we have built what I call “<a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/when-deepware-meets-wetware-the-uncomfortable-truth-about-responsible-ai-245842121749""><em>deepware</em></a>” — neural networks and machine learning systems layered atop our traditional software and hardware. <br />These architectures can process, pattern-match, and produce at speeds we cannot fathom. Yet in our rush to innovate, we have convinced ourselves that <em>deepware</em> can carry the weight of responsibility our <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetware_(brain)""><em>wetware</em></a> — our human brains and nervous systems — seems increasingly willing to surrender. We are moving again, but this time the question is whether we are moving forward or simply moving away.<br />Because this time, the shift is not from physical to mental. It is from execution to <strong><em>responsibility</em></strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""A horizontal timeline infographic titled “The Evolution of Human Work.” It shows five large coloured circles connected by a black arrow, each representing a stage of labor. Nomadic (Hunting): “Physical survival, hunt and gather.” Agricultural (Farming): “Tied to land and seasonal cycles.” Industrial (Factories): “From muscle to machine labour.” Information (Knowledge): “Brains over brawn: data and knowledge.” Deepware (Responsibility): “Execution shifts to responsibility and ethics.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ImgkXpy6k2_U53LUT5K7XQ.png"" /><figcaption>The evolution of work, from hunting to responsibility.</figcaption></figure><p>As <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Narayanan"">Arvind Narayanan</a> at Princeton observes, jobs are not monolithic entities. They are bundles of tasks. Some tasks are routine and susceptible to automation. Others require distinctly human qualities: judgement, ethics, accountability, wisdom.</p><p>The question is not whether AI can perform tasks. It demonstrably can, often better than we can. The question is who takes responsibility when those tasks produce consequences in the real world.</p><h3>Outputs are not outcomes</h3><p>This distinction matters more than most organisations realise.</p><p><strong>Output</strong> is what a process produces. Code. Copy. Designs. Legal briefs. Medical recommendations. Outputs are the tangible results of a system executing its programmed or prescribed function — the direct product of following steps, rules, or algorithms. The term emerged in the industrial era, literally describing the quantity of coal or iron a mine could extract in a given period. Output depends entirely on the efficiency and capability of the process that generates it.</p><p><strong>Outcome</strong> is what happens when that output meets reality. An outcome requires context, interpretation, application, and crucially — <em>intentionality</em>. Outcomes demand understanding not just what was produced, but why it matters, who it affects, and what consequences ripple from it. Where outputs measure productivity, outcomes measure impact. They are the ultimate change or consequence that results from applying an output with purpose and judgment.<br />AI can generate outputs. It cannot, however, create outcomes. Because outcomes require something <em>deepware</em> fundamentally lacks: the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetware_(brain)""><em>wetware</em></a> capacity for responsibility.</p><p>Computers cannot be held accountable, as IBM recognised in 1979. That truth has not changed. What has changed is our willingness to pretend otherwise.</p><figure><img alt=""IBM’s note stating: A computer can never be held accountable. Therefore a computer must never make a management decision."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*KxrF3PVHDs2TbLRh.png"" /><figcaption>IBM note, 1979</figcaption></figure><h3>The accountability vacuum</h3><p>We have already seen the cost of this pretension. A <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/06/03/attorneys-court-ai-hallucinations-judges/"">lawyer</a> in the US submitted AI-generated briefs filled with fabricated cases. A trial in <a href=""https://www.usnews.com/news/offbeat/articles/2025-08-15/australian-lawyer-apologizes-for-ai-generated-errors-in-murder-case"">Australia</a> was delayed because no one verified the AI’s outputs. These were not technological failures — these were failures of human responsibility.</p><p>When a professional says “the AI recommended it,” they are engaging in the same moral abdication as someone saying “I was just following orders.” Both statements attempt to transfer accountability to something — or someone — <a href=""https://emerge.digital/resources/ai-accountability-whos-responsible-when-ai-goes-wrong/"">incapable</a> of bearing it.</p><p>This is the dangerous seduction of <em>deepware</em>: it offers us the illusion that we can delegate not just tasks, but responsibility itself.</p><p>We cannot. We must not.</p><p>The future of work, then, is not about humans competing with AI for task execution. It is about humans stepping into roles where we exercise oversight, judgement, and accountability over the outputs that AI produces. This is not replacement. This is elevation.</p><p>But only if we prepare for it.</p><h3>The skills <em>deepware</em> cannot replicate</h3><p>Here is what the regulations already understand, even if organisations do not: responsible AI demands responsible humans. <br />The <a href=""https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai"">EU AI Act </a>mandates human oversight, transparency in decision-making, and clear accountability chains. Not as bureaucratic burden, but as fundamental safeguard.</p><p>Because here is the uncomfortable truth about <em>deepware</em>: it learns from historical data, which means it perpetuates historical biases.</p><p><a href=""https://www.cangrade.com/blog/hr-strategy/hiring-bias-gone-wrong-amazon-recruiting-case-study/"">Amazon’s</a> recruitment algorithm discriminated against women. <a href=""https://fairnow.ai/workday-lawsuit-resume-screening/"">Workday’s</a> hiring system did the same with 40+ candidates. <a href=""https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/even-a-small-typo-can-throw-off-ai-medical-advice-mit-study-says"">MIT</a> research found that AI healthcare systems told female patients they were more likely to “manage illness at home”. <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/search/can-you-review-this-article-an-G_Tc8IpkTOyF.Bj47m8IfQ"">Judicial</a> algorithms found Black defendants more culpable.</p><p>These are not glitches. These are features of systems trained on data that encoded decades of invisible discrimination.</p><p>So when we talk about the future of work, we are really talking about the future capacity of humans to think critically about the machines we build. To question their outputs. To interrogate their processes. To identify bias. To imagine consequences. To demand better.</p><p>This requires a different skill set entirely:</p><p><strong>Critical thinking: </strong>the ability to evaluate claims, identify assumptions, and distinguish correlation from causation.</p><p><strong>Systems thinking: </strong>understanding how components interact, how changes ripple, how second and third-order effects emerge.</p><p><strong>Lateral thinking: </strong>seeing connections across domains, applying insights from one context to another.</p><p><strong>Scenario planning: </strong>running mental simulations of possible futures, stress-testing decisions before implementation.</p><p><strong>Consequence thinking: </strong>asking not just “can we?” but “should we?” and “then what?”</p><p>Notice what these skills have in common. They are uniquely human. They require <em>wetware</em> that is fully engaged, not atrophied from disuse.</p><h3>The extension that could replace us</h3><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan"">Marshall McLuhan</a> wrote in 1967 that <em>“all technologies are extensions of our physical and nervous systems to increase power and speed.</em>” <br />The wheel extended our legs. The telescope extended our eyes. Now <em>deepware</em> extends our cognitive capacity.</p><p>But here is McLuhan’s warning, implicit in every page: when an extension becomes too powerful, we risk forgetting the limb it was meant to serve. We outsource function, and eventually, capability atrophies.</p><p>Consider the calculator. Brilliant tool. But an entire generation now cannot perform basic arithmetic without one. The extension has replaced the skill.</p><p>Now scale that to <em>deepware</em>. If we allow AI to think for us — to analyse, to recommend, to decide — without maintaining our own capacity to audit and override, we risk something far more dangerous than job loss. We risk becoming obsolete not because machines replaced us, but because we voluntarily stepped aside.</p><h3>The choice that defines the next era</h3><p>The future of work is not a future without humans. It is a future where humans do fundamentally different work: the <strong><em>work of being responsible</em></strong>.</p><p>This means verification before deployment. Critical thinking over speed. Systems thinking over isolated innovation. Accountability at every level.</p><p>It means training a generation not just to prompt AI, but to <em>interrogate</em> it. Not just to deploy models, but to <em>govern</em> them. Not just to consume outputs, but to construct meaningful <em>outcomes</em>.</p><p>It means recognising that as our <em>deepware</em> grows more sophisticated, our <em>wetware</em> must grow more rigorous. Every layer of AI we add demands an exponential increase in human oversight.</p><p>This is not optional. This is existential.</p><p>Mary Smith lost her job when the alarm clock arrived. But she did not lose her capacity for work — she adapted. Her children worked in offices, not on streets. Her grandchildren worked in roles she could never have imagined.</p><p>The same will be true for us, but only if we make a conscious choice: to remain conscious. To refuse the abdication of responsibility that <em>deepware</em> makes so seductively easy. To recognise that outcomes require human judgement in ways that outputs never will.</p><p>Our <em>wetware</em> remains the most sophisticated technology we possess. In the age of <em>deepware</em>, it is also the only thing preventing a future where machines own not just our code, but our agency.</p><p>The next time someone shows you what AI can do, we need to ask them something more important: who is responsible when it goes wrong?</p><p>Because in the end, the future of work depends not on what machines can produce, but on whether humans remember that we, and only we, can be held accountable for what happens next.</p><p><em>For a deeper exploration of the deepware-wetware framework and why responsible AI fundamentally depends on active human cognition, read: </em><a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/when-deepware-meets-wetware-the-uncomfortable-truth-about-responsible-ai-245842121749""><em>When Deepware meets Wetware: the uncomfortable truth about responsible AI</em></a></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a9293109b3be"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/when-machines-make-outputs-humans-must-own-outcomes-a9293109b3be"">When machines make outputs, humans must own outcomes</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

However, these days it appears not as a defiant rejection of values, but as a quiet erosion of purpose met with a shrug of apathy.</p><p>Ends are replaced by metrics, conviction by convenience, and narrative by feeds. Secularism, politics, ideology, and technology are often blamed. However, another force hides in plain sight — design.</p><p>If one had to describe what nihilistic design looks like, it would be sterile, stripped of conviction, void of meaning, and soulless. Sound familiar?</p><p>Those same traits could be used to describe how many <a href=""https://www.thesecretdeveloper.com/blog/why-logos-are-gettingnbspboring"">brands</a>, <a href=""https://takt.com/articles/why-good-ux-is-making-websites-boring-and-how-to-fix-it/"">websites, and apps</a> appear today. No color, no texture, no shape— just flat, black and white, afraid to offend, and content to remain barren.</p><figure><img alt=""A collage of various webpage screenshots: OpenAI’s homepage, Google search, Facebook login, a social media platform, NVIDIA’s article, Apple products, Adidas shopping, and a fitness brand site."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8ublcl5lGeZitYR0XPuiUQ.png"" /><figcaption>Screen images of OpenAI, Google, Facebook, X, Nvidia, Apple, Adidas, and Nike.</figcaption></figure><p>We like to think design reflects culture. The <a href=""https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/the-baroque-style?srsltid=AfmBOorubuaM7Snv5M_p9U5B8ZpV5oc3rLu0axgNjmUbkj6KroOSsSFp"">ornament of the Baroque in the 17th century</a>, the geometric rigor of <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/art/Art-Deco"">Art Deco in the 1920s</a>, the <a href=""https://www.popbae.com/blogs/trends/summer-in-neon?srsltid=AfmBOoo9lDJUkloWIryj199z_wvnX_Gf1PVDfFYLcxG3u-m5OugoYfNF"">neon excess of the 1980s</a> — each seems like a mirror of the society that created it.</p><p>But what if this familiar story has it backwards? What if culture is not simply echoed in design, but shaped by it? What if the sterile and hollow interfaces we produce today are not passive reflections of nihilism, but active producers of it?</p><p>This idea has deep philosophical roots. <a href=""https://www.wilde-online.info/the-decay-of-lying-page15.html"">Oscar Wilde once argued that life imitates art</a> far more than art imitates life. <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-aesthetics/"">Friedrich Nietzsche believed that aesthetics precede truth,</a> that existence itself is justified only as an aesthetic phenomenon. <a href=""https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/mcluhan.mediummessage.pdf"">Marshall McLuhan declared that the medium is the message,</a> and <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/baudrillard/"">Jean Baudrillard pushed it further</a>, claiming that signs and images no longer reflect reality but generate it.</p><p>If this is true, the pattern is unmistakable—design doesn’t just record meaning, it scripts it. And once design withers, culture follows close behind.</p><h4>From story to feed</h4><p>Cultural forms once carried narrative. Cathedrals told stories in stone and glass. Novels and films offered beginnings, middles, and ends that gave coherence to life. Even broadcast television moved within familiar arcs.</p><figure><img alt=""Panoramic view of Paris at sunset, highlighting the golden dome of Les Invalides and the modern Montparnasse Tower amidst historic architecture. Warm, vibrant tones."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*yjxUVTkh6xVmKbl6sJcACg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Montparnasse and Les Invalides, Paris | Image source: <a href=""https://pixers.us/stickers/tour-montparnasse-and-les-invalides-paris-45670313"">pixers.us</a></figcaption></figure><p>Today that coherence is harder to find. Much can be said about the bland architecture of our cities and the thinning narratives of contemporary movies and novels, but one of the most concerning shifts has been in the evolution of streaming television.</p><p>Television experiences that once delivered episodes with self-contained stories now lean heavily on season-long arcs—<a href=""https://medium.com/a-suburban-prison/why-are-tv-shows-canceled-9b95db46a4a4""> arcs that may never conclude if the series is canceled</a>. Stories hang suspended, deferred, or abandoned, and audiences grow accustomed to living with open loops, each pause just another cue to crave the next dopamine hit that never truly satisfies.</p><p>Nowhere are open loops more pervasive than the internet, especially social media. Here, design has abandoned narrative architecture altogether. Scroll-based feeds deliver hours of endless, unresolved experience. Search itself has become infinite — every query spawning new links, new threads, new rabbit holes without finality. These systems do not merely reflect shortened attention spans—they train us into them.</p><p>What’s lost in this shift is the <a href=""https://medium.com/digital-media-society-spring-2020/the-impact-that-streaming-sites-have-on-society-ef45c37f2efe"">collective experience</a>. Once, cultural scarcity bound people together — shared stories, shared rituals, shared meanings that culminated. Meaning deepened because it was finite, because it felt resolved. Now we chase a superficial sense of significance in the infinite. But infinity never resolves. It offers no closure, only the perpetual lure of what lies just beyond.</p><h4>The myth of neutrality</h4><p>Minimalism and modernism complicate the story further. These movements, and their descendants in today’s flat digital interfaces, often parade as neutral. The grid, the sans serif, the clean white background — all claim to transcend culture, to present the universal. But neutrality is a myth. Every omission is a worldview.</p><p>By removing ornament, context, and symbol, design does not simply clear space for function — it establishes an aesthetic where emptiness itself becomes a virtue. This virtue is not neutral—it is rooted in Western Enlightenment ideals of rationality and order. A stripped-down interface tells us that depth is clutter, that meaning is noise, that efficiency is the highest good.</p><p>This unraveling of layered meaning now reaches even long-form writing. Articles like this, which should invite reflection, are met with readers possessed by the demand for expediency — brevity, punch, imagery. Platforms like Instagram and X (Twitter) have trained us to crave immediacy over depth. Pictures replace paragraphs, glances replace grasp, and culture learns to settle for surfaces.</p><h4>Reason without conviction</h4><p>What makes this drift even more insidious is the way design has cloaked itself in the language of reason. Research, usability testing, and A/B experiments all serve as proof that design is objective. Yet philosophy has long shown that reason cannot prove itself.</p><p>As <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/"">Immanual Kant</a> observed, reason always bumps against the limits of what it can justify. <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/"">David Hume</a> warned that no amount of empirical observation can bridge the gap from “is” to “ought.” <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel/"">Kurt Gödel</a> demonstrated that even mathematics, the purest structure of reason, contains truths that cannot be proven within its own system. And <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/"">Nietzsche</a> reminded us that what we take as “truth” often conceals underlying values and power.</p><p>When design insists that data is its foundation, it forgets that even data rests on faith — in our senses, our instruments, and our frameworks. What presents itself as objectivity quickly slides into <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/"">relativism</a>, guided not by conviction but by whichever metric performs best in an experiment. Meaning evaporates in the process. Usability without story, efficiency without soul — these become the hallmarks of design that has abandoned belief in meaning itself.</p><figure><img alt=""Cartoon of two men analyzing a dashboard with charts. A janitor nearby discards a paper. Caption reads, “Do we trust this data?” conveying skepticism."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/1*5niuoxNYCmrP5Fr_COXeGw.png"" /><figcaption>Illustration by <a href=""https://dataedo.com/cartoon/tag/trust-data"">Piotr Kononow</a></figcaption></figure><h4>AI and the acceleration of emptiness</h4><p>Artificial intelligence is the logical extension of this trajectory — an engine built on reason based technology—data, pattern recognition, statistical inference — yet stripped of the conviction or belief that gives form meaning.</p><p>An AI-generated logo may look polished, but beneath the surface there is nothing. It is statistically coherent but culturally vacant, a reflection of averages without values.</p><p>Scaled up, these outputs flood culture with forms that only pretend to carry meaning. The danger is not simply their hollowness, but the way they train us to accept hollowness as normal.</p><p>Worse, their conversational mimicry — the illusion of a voice that “understands” — <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/building-trust-in-opaque-systems-ce38cef741b6"">creates trust where none is warranted</a>. We begin to trust the simulation of meaning rather than meaning itself.</p><p>When design can be generated in seconds, we learn to value speed over depth, convenience over conviction. The more we consume forms without substance, the more we adapt to their vacancy.</p><p>AI doesn’t just produce empty surfaces — it trains us to stop expecting meaning at all. And that quiet erosion of expectation is what makes it an accelerant of nihilism.</p><h4>Design as an engine of nihilism</h4><p>In contemporary design the inversion becomes clear. It doesn’t merely display nihilism — it drives it. Infinite feeds manufacture distraction. Minimalist sameness recasts emptiness as elegance. AI systems hint at human replaceability and then condition us to accept it.</p><p>Today’s interfaces aren’t passive reflections of culture. They script the way we see, think, and value. In their hollow repetitions they embed a lesson— nothing lasts, everything is disposable, and meaning is irrelevant.</p><p>Once these forms take hold, culture completes the circuit. Users absorb the cues and stop expecting depth. The less story, symbolism, or conviction design provides, the more indulgent such elements appear when they do surface.</p><p>The loop accelerates until the pursuit of meaning seems archaic. Emptiness is marketed as efficiency, even clarity. And here lies the danger—nihilism does not remain an abstract idea but becomes a lived condition.</p><p>At that point design doesn’t follow culture — it steers it, training us not only to live without meaning but to stop wanting it. That is how nihilism, once a philosophical diagnosis, becomes the default atmosphere of everyday life. And sadly, we are in the midst of such decay.</p><h4>Toward a design of meaning</h4><p>If this diagnosis is right, then design carries more responsibility than we often admit. It is not neutral. It is not merely reactive. It is formative. Which means that if design has played a role in producing nihilism, it can also play a role in resisting it.</p><p>The challenge is not to restore some lost objectivity — that foundation never existed. The challenge is to create values where none are given. Nietzsche saw this as the only way through nihilism — to become creators of meaning rather than its mourners.</p><p><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kierkegaard/"">Søren Kierkegaard</a>, too, understood that escaping despair required more than reason—it demanded a leap of faith, an act of commitment that could not be justified in advance.</p><p>For design, that means reintroducing narrative into interfaces, reclaiming symbolism, and insisting that even in a secular and fragmented modern society, design can be an act of conviction rather than resignation. Meaning doesn’t emerge from an infinite feed of possibilities but from forms that resolve, gestures that culminate, and experiences that cohere.</p><p>Some designs already gesture in this direction. <a href=""https://duolingo-papers.s3.amazonaws.com/reports/Duolingo_whitepaper_duolingo_method_2023.pdf"">Duolingo, for example, transforms small units of repetition into a narrative of progress</a> — each lesson resolves, each milestone carries symbolic weight. It shows that interfaces need not be hollow loops of engagement, but can script arcs of meaning that accumulate over time.</p><figure><img alt=""“Left side: An orange flame and ‘5 day streak’ indicate practice consistency.

Its strength lies in its boundary—you can’t binge it, and its closure is literal and shared.</p><p>Because the puzzle is the same for everyone, it becomes a point of convergence — a common experience across strangers and communities.

Every decision is ethical labyrinth. Every omission shapes culture. Every interface is an argument about how meaning works. If our designs are hollow, they will train us into hollowness. If they carry conviction, they will cultivate conviction.</p><h4>Choosing meaning</h4><p>We like to say design reflects culture, but that’s only half the truth. Culture also reflects design. And the interfaces we are building today don’t just echo nihilism — they embed it, normalize it, and accelerate it. The real question isn’t whether design has agency, but whether designers are willing to own the meanings they create — or the voids they leave behind.</p><p>Part of the work is rhetorical. Designers can <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/rhetorical-triangle/"">learn to reframe meaning</a> as a kind of metric in itself — arguing that coherence builds retention, that conviction breeds loyalty. If the industry only speaks numbers, then one task is to translate values into that language without losing the values themselves.</p><p>If we refuse that responsibility, our interfaces will go on teaching the same lesson, swipe after swipe—that meaning itself is negotiable, optional, disposable. And the more we live inside those lessons, the more we risk losing the very capacity to imagine life beyond the abyss.</p><p><strong><em>Don’t miss out! </em></strong><a href=""https://micbuckcreative.medium.com/subscribe""><strong><em>Join my email list</em></strong></a><strong><em> and receive the latest content.</em></strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4b8617293462"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/contemporary-design-doesnt-just-reflect-nihilism-it-creates-it-4b8617293462"">Contemporary design doesn’t just reflect nihilism, it creates it.</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<p>Cosmic beings, welcome to the week where <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-blood-corn-moon-lunar-eclipse-in-pisces-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">eclipse season</a> officially closes — and it doesn’t end with a whisper, it ends with a roar. On October 6th, the Aries Full Moon rises, bringing to culmination storylines that began back on March 29th, 2025, when the Aries Solar Eclipse cracked open new paths for us. If the spring invited you to name what you want, this week asks: have you fought for it, stood by it, and honored your needs without apology? Expect recognition — whether internal or external — for the seeds you dared to plant months ago. Aries energy doesn’t let you hide. It pushes you onto the stage, spotlight blazing, reminding you that your desires and boundaries matter as much as anyone else’s. <br /><br />And this isn’t just any Aries Full Moon. It’s ruled by Mars, who is currently swimming through the depths of Scorpio. Mercury and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars are both in Scorpio</a>, turning the collective vibe into fiery lava: molten, raw, unmissable. Add Juno, the asteroid of commitment, in Sagittarius, another Fire sign, and you get this rare alchemy of passion, clarity, and intensity. It’s the kind of week where individuals realize their superpowers, and the collective realizes its power to unite. Think strikes, movements, protests, declarations of love, or simply saying “no more” where you’ve stayed quiet too long. Aries + Scorpio = power reclaimed. </p>



<p>But what goes up must eventually ground. From October 8th through the 10th, the Moon shifts into Taurus, cooling the lava into fertile earth. These are the days to slow down, process, and stabilize whatever breakthroughs the Aries Full Moon lit up. Taurus energy reminds us that no matter how wild the firestorm, change only sticks if it’s sustainable. And then comes 10/10, a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025-numerology-meaning"">numerological Ascension Portal</a>, aligned with the Moon’s entrance into Gemini. This is your green light to share, teach, write, or create with levity — all the intensity has prepared you to communicate with both fire and grace. <br /><br />So yes, this is not your typical full moon week. It’s a Mars-ruled supercharge wrapped in Aries initiation, Scorpio intensity, Taurus grounding, and Gemini curiosity. Individually, you’re closing one eclipse chapter and stepping into a braver version of yourself. Collectively, we’re realizing that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/speak-up-be-vocal-mental-health-awareness"">when we speak up</a>, move with conviction, and refuse to shrink, the Universe shifts with us. Stand tall, cosmic beings. You’re entering this week not just as yourself — but as your most unapologetically empowered self yet. <br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>This week is your cosmic mic-drop moment, Aries. The Full Moon in your sign on October 6th feels like a personal rebirth, one that’s been building since the solar eclipse in Aries back on March 29th. Think of it as six months of shadow work, self assertion, and courage, now culminating in a fiery climax. You may feel lit up and raw, like your entire being is under a spotlight. And yes, that comes with shadows: you might demand intensity or depth from people who just can’t meet you there, or you might project your own restless transformation onto relationships. Be mindful not to burn bridges unnecessarily… you’re leveling up, but not everyone’s on the same timeline, and that’s okay. The lesson here is to honor your growth without needing everyone else to validate it. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mercury has joined your ruler Mars in Scorpio, activating your sector of shared resources, intimacy, and deep transformation. Money talks could get very real: paying off debt, applying for grants, negotiating contracts, or finally clarifying joint financial agreements. Don’t shy away from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/inexpensive-prenup"">these conversations</a>: your clarity is power right now. Venus is spending its final week in Virgo, lighting up your health and wellness zone. It’s a reminder that love doesn’t just show up in romance, it shows up in how safe your body feels in someone’s presence. As you celebrate how much you’ve grown these past six months, practice discernment without nitpicking — both in relationships and with yourself. You’re not meant to feel “done”; you’re meant to feel alive, in motion, and deeply committed to your own evolution. </p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Be honest, Taurus: when was the last time you truly unplugged? This Aries Full Moon is hitting your sector of rest and surrender, so if your body is screaming “nap!” this week, it’s not laziness… it’s literally the astrology of the week. The eclipse season finale is pulling you inward, like the Universe put a “do not disturb” sign on your aura. That might feel weird for a sign that loves stability, but here’s the gag: your growth right now comes from letting go of control. Watch for the shadow of self-sabotage: overworking, overthinking, or staying too available to people who don’t give the same back. <em>What if the most radical move you make this week is saying no, logging off, and </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/protect-your-peace-resolutions-2025""><em>protecting your peace</em></a><em>? </em><br /><br />At the same time, Mercury and Mars are stirring your Scorpio house of partnerships, making convos with bae, besties, or biz partners way spicier. Someone might drop a truth bomb that changes the whole game. Lean into it — this is how bonds deepen or dissolve. Venus is finishing up in Virgo, reminding you in your romance + pleasure zone that love should feel like <em>chill joy, </em>not an exhausting performance review. Who makes your nervous system purr instead of spike? That’s your answer. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The Aries Full Moon is calling BS on your social life, Gemini. Who’s really in your corner? Who’s just here for the memes and vibes, and who’s showing up when it counts? <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-blood-corn-moon-lunar-eclipse-in-pisces-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Eclipse season</a> closing out in your community sector feels like a group chat cleanse. You don’t have to ghost everyone, but you do need to notice where your energy gets hyped versus where it gets drained. And here’s the kicker: sometimes the crowd you crave isn’t even on your current radar. Aries wants you to initiate — join that movement, DM that creative, sign up for that workshop. Stop waiting for the invite. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Mercury and Mars in Scorpio are dragging you back to your daily grind, asking: are your routines giving “organized queen” or “chaotic scroll hole”? This is the perfect week to ditch distractions and commit to systems that actually make life smoother. The shadow side? Burning yourself out trying to do <em>all </em>the productivity hacks at once. Venus in Virgo closes out in your home sector, so cozy-fying your nest or setting firmer fam boundaries could be the ultimate form of self-care. Reminder: you don’t need a thousand followers — you need the right ones, both online and IRL. </p>

<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Career plot twist incoming, Cancer. This week’s Aries Full Moon is at the very top of your chart, and it’s giving <em>main character energy. </em>Spotlight. Recognition. Maybe even a “wait, you do <em>what </em>for work?!” moment from people who’ve been underestimating you. But the catch is this: Aries doesn’t do small talk. If you’ve been hiding your ambition or waiting for permission to shine, this lunation is snatching the excuses away. Shadow alert: don’t let the hunger for external claps drown out your own inner compass. Your worth isn’t up for debate. <br /><br />And oooh, Mercury + Mars are heating up your Scorpio creativity zone, so your muses are LOUD right now. Think late-night writing sprees, love notes that accidentally turn into poetry, or suddenly realizing you want to launch that project you’ve been lowkey scared of. Romance also feels extra magnetic, but again, this isn’t casual; it’s deep, consuming, maybe a little dramatic. Venus ends its Virgo run in your communication house, polishing your words with discernment. Translation? You’ve got receipts and you’re not afraid to use them, but you also know when to speak with grace. By week’s end, you’ll realize: your evolution isn’t about <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/01/11649504/safe-settling-job-security-career-progression"">playing safe in the corner</a>. It’s about stepping on stage, mic in hand, saying, “This is me — deal with it.” </p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, this week’s Aries Full Moon is practically daring you to stop shrinking and step into a bigger world. It’s firing up your sector of travel, philosophy, and long-term dreams — aka the part of your chart that screams, <em>go live your main-character montage already. </em>This lunation wants you to risk, expand, and chase the thing you’ve been side-eyeing for months. Shadow check: don’t confuse “bold” with “chaotic.” Just because you feel unstoppable doesn’t mean you need to max out a credit card on a random trip to Bali (unless…). </p>



<p>Mercury and Mars are deep-diving in your sector of home, family, and foundations, so the drama may hit closer to your couch than your passport. Conversations at home could be sharp, revealing, or… a little spicy. Lean in without turning everything into a power struggle. Meanwhile, Venus is wrapping up in Virgo in your money and values sector, reminding you that financial glow-ups require discernment. Translation: treat <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/digital-wallet-benefits-saving-money"">your budget like a canvas</a>, not a cage. Yes, you can splurge, but do it on something that makes your soul and your spreadsheet happy.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, the Aries Full Moon is lighting up your sector of intimacy and shared resources, and the question this week is: what (or who) are you really willing to merge with? This lunation brings clarity around money, debt, emotional bonds, or sexual ties — basically anything that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10751082/should-you-trust-your-gut-instinct"">requires deep trust</a>. Shadow side? Expecting 100% transparency from others while still keeping your own cards close to your chest. Aries energy says: honesty first, then decide if the connection is worth your time. <br /><br />On top of that, Mercury and Mars are stirring your sector of communication and learning, so your words are carrying extra punch. Be mindful: you can deliver truth without accidentally stabbing someone with it. Venus is closing out its time in Virgo itself, putting <em>you </em>in the spotlight one last time. That means your aura is magnetic right now, but it also means your inner critic could get loud. Please remember: refinement is cute, self-shaming is not. Own how much you’ve grown since March without nitpicking the parts still in progress. </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, this week’s Aries Full Moon is glowing up your partnership sector, which means relationships — romantic, platonic, business, you name it — are center stage. This is the kind of lunation where ultimatums get dropped, confessions spill out, or you finally say “enough” to the dynamics that have been draining you. Shadow check: don’t outsource your self-worth to someone else’s reaction. The Aries Full Moon’s magnetic energy reminds you: your “yes” and your “no” both carry power. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mercury and Mars in Scorpio are igniting your money and resources sector, so expect conversations about finances, investments, or even overdue payments to heat up. This isn’t the week to avoid your budget; it’s the week to get <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/loud-budgeting-money-boundaries"">clear about what’s yours</a> versus what’s theirs. Venus is closing its run in Virgo in your private, spiritual sector, softening the edges and reminding you to take space for yourself amidst all the relational fireworks. The more grounded you feel in your own company, the clearer it’ll be who’s meant to walk beside you. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, the Aries Full Moon is setting fire to your sector of work, health, and daily rhythm this week, so if your routines feel like they’re getting a cosmic performance review, you’re not wrong. This lunation is a wake-up call to check in on what’s actually supporting you versus what’s draining you. Maybe you’ve been overextending yourself or letting perfectionism dictate your schedule, and now your body is like, <em>we need balance, fam. </em>The growth here comes from realizing that efficiency isn’t about doing more… it’s about aligning your energy with what matters most. Don’t just “push through”; redesign your days so they work <em>for </em>you. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mercury and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars are in your sign</a>, which is basically you with a bullhorn: louder, sharper, and less afraid to confront what’s been lurking in the shadows. This gives you the edge to tackle conversations you’ve been avoiding, whether it’s asking for more resources, setting firmer boundaries, or admitting what you actually want. The shadow side? Over-intensity. Not everyone can meet you in the depths, so know when to pull back. Venus is finishing its stay in Virgo in your friendship sector, helping you notice which connections feel nourishing versus which feel transactional. The takeaway: the right people support your growth without draining your spark, and you’ll know exactly who those people are by week’s end. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, this week’s Aries Full Moon is turning the spotlight on your sector of romance, joy, and creative fire… basically the part of your chart that screams <em>fun, fun, fun. </em>This lunation wants you to reclaim pleasure in the ways you may have pushed to the side since March. Think about what hobbies, relationships, or artistic projects make you lose track of time, and then ask yourself why you’re not giving them more space in your life. The shadow side of this moon is overindulgence or chasing thrills just for the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/05/9810670/dopamine-fasting-quarantine"">dopamine hit</a>, but Aries energy wants you to commit to what feels <em>real </em>and life-giving. Your creative spark is valid, so stop minimizing it. </p>



<p>At the same time, Mercury and Mars in Scorpio are activating your spiritual and subconscious sector, making your inner world louder than ever. You might notice dreams getting wilder, intuitive nudges arriving out of nowhere, or buried fears resurfacing. Instead of dodging them, lean in… clarity lives on the other side of discomfort. Venus in Virgo is closing out in your career sector, making this a stellar week to tidy up your professional image or cut ties with draining projects. One more thing: your public life and your private imagination are feeding off each other right now, so pay attention to the subtle ways your creativity wants to shape your next big move. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the Aries Full Moon is sparking change in your sector of home, roots, and emotional foundations, and the question is: do you feel safe where you are? This lunation can feel like a release point around <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-women-healing-panic-attacks"">family patterns</a>, living situations, or the ways you’ve been carrying everyone else’s weight. Shadow side: thinking you have to fix everything and everyone before you allow yourself to rest. Aries energy reminds you that your healing and your sense of home deserve to be a priority, not an afterthought. When you build safety within, everything else can grow from there. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mercury and Mars in Scorpio are energizing your community and friendship sector, which could mean dynamic conversations with your crew or joining a collective effort that feels bigger than yourself. It’s a great week for networking, collaborations, or speaking out, but watch your delivery, Scorpio’s intensity can turn into stingers if you’re not intentional. Venus is wrapping up in Virgo in your adventure sector, encouraging you to expand through learning, travel, or fresh perspectives. Don’t just dream about getting out of your comfort zone; take one concrete step toward it. This week shows you that home is both where you are and where you dare to go next. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, this week’s Aries Full Moon is blasting open your sector of communication and self-expression, and your inbox might as well be on fire. This lunation wants you to speak your truth without watering it down — whether that’s sending the text you’ve been drafting in your head, pitching the idea no one saw coming, or simply telling yourself a new story about what’s possible. Shadow check: watch out for impulsive words that land like grenades. Just because you feel it strongly doesn’t mean you need to hit “send” at 3am. Ask yourself, <em>is this honest or is this just heat-of-the-moment? </em>That extra breath can save a friendship. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mercury and Mars are stirring your sector of career and reputation, which means you’re hot on people’s radar. Power meetings, sudden opportunities, or straight-up confrontations with authority figures may pop this week. This is your cue to own the spotlight instead of side-stepping it — you’ve earned it. Venus is closing its stay in Virgo in your intimacy and shared resources sector, asking you to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/casual-relationship-rules-boundaries"">refine your boundaries</a> around money, sex, and emotional labor. Who drains you, who fuels you, and how are you honoring your own value? By the end of the week, you’ll see clearly: your voice matters, and your boundaries protect the brilliance you’re here to share. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, this week’s Aries Full Moon is illuminating your sector of money, values, and self-worth, so let’s talk coin and confidence. This lunation might highlight what you’ve been hustling for since March — where the financial wins are real and where leaks still need plugging. Shadow side of this full moon? Equating your value to your bank account, or blowing cash to feel validated. Ask yourself: <em>am I </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/labubu-plushie-charm-popularity-high-spending""><em>spending to escape</em></a><em> or to expand? </em>Aries wants you to know your worth first, then act from that grounded place. </p>



<p>At the same time, Mercury and Mars are activating your sector of expansion, meaning your inner philosopher is <em>loud</em>. Big conversations about travel, education, or spiritual growth could spark, and you’re craving experiences that stretch your perspective. Just don’t burn out trying to chase every single path… depth beats scatter right now. Venus finishes its run in Virgo in your partnership sector, highlighting what balance and reciprocity really feel like. Are your connections supporting your growth, or pulling you into old patterns of over-giving? This week, your finances and your relationships both point back to the same truth: when you honor yourself, everything else starts to align. </p>

There have been some stellar <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/book-to-tv-movies-adaptations-2024"">book-to-screen adaptations</a> so far in 2025, from <em><a href=""https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/81751137"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Thursday Murder Club</a></em> to <em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mIvD-GN-p4"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Caught Stealing</a></em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mIvD-GN-p4"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">.</a> While we're slowly inching our way to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/subtle-christmas-nail-art-designs"">Christmas</a>, there are still many more delightful book adaptations to come.

Just look at how massive <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hunger-games"">The Hunger Games</a></em> and <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/twilight-renaissance"">Twilight</a></em> became, with <em>Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping</em> due to land in 2026.

<p>Now that <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/09/11934126/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-ending"">The Summer I Turned Pretty</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/09/11934126/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-ending""> Season 3 has wrapped up</a>, it feels like there’s a hole in our hearts. Instead of spending our Wednesday nights with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-conrad-jeremiah"">Conrad Fisher</a> and Belly Conklin, we’re impatiently waiting for <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-movie"">The Summer I Turned Pretty </a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-movie"">movie</a> to come our way. It’s disappointing to lose yet another <em>escape-the-world</em> show, where the messy universe of Cousins Beach and cheating scandals could take your mind off life admin and grown-up problems. Luckily, there are a plethora of other shows to fill the gap — whether you’re after more teenage angst, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/book-to-tv-movies-adaptations-2025"">book-to-screen adaptations</a>, or even another series about a girl torn between two brothers.</p>



<p>From other YA series to classics that still hold up today, here are 9 shows like <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em> to add to your watchlist. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>My Life with the Walter Boys</em></h2>







<p>Lovingly dubbed the “yeehaw version” of <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em> by fans, Netflix’s take on the brother-love-triangle trope is just as addictive as <em>TSITP</em>. Based on a YA Wattpad novel by Ali Novak, it follows recently orphaned teen Jackie (Nikki Rodriguez). After moving from the big city to a country ranch in Colorado, she begins to adjust to life with her mother’s friend and her 11 children. She begins to have feelings for brothers Cole Walter and Alex Walter at the same time, leading to turmoil and angst. </p>

<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>XO, Kitty</em></h2>







<p>From the mind of Jenny Han, creator and writer of <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em>, comes an original spinoff from her <em>To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before </em>trilogy. Following Lara Jean’s (Lana Condor) younger sister Kitty Covey (Anna Cathcart) as she settles into boarding school in Seoul, South Korea, this show provides the perfect mix of K-Drama and what we all loved from the <em>TATBILB </em>movies.</p>



<p><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Netflix</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>Outer Banks</em></h2>







<p><em>Outer Banks (OBX)</em> is one of Netflix’s biggest hits, with four seasons already on the streaming platform. If you’re looking for a beachy vibe like <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em>, add this to your watchlist. </p>



<p>It follows a group of friends in North Carolina on a treasure hunt tied to John B’s (Chase Stokes) father. Expect car crashes, characters being stuck on desert islands, murder and other dramatic storylines.</p>



<p><strong>Where to watch: </strong> Netflix</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>One Tree Hill</em></h2>







<p>If you’re craving love triangles involving brothers, we’ve got another one for you. <em>One Tree Hill</em> follows half-brothers Lucas (Chad Michael Murray) and Nathan Scott (James Lafferty) as fierce basketball rivals, who are also after the same romantic interest, Peyton Sawyer (Hilarie Burton). This show has some of the most heartwrenching cliffhangers and horrifying storylines for a teen drama in history, so if you want to go on a wild ride, add this to your watchlist.</p>



<p><strong>Where to watch: </strong>HBO Max</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>Heartstopper</em></h2>







<p>Another book-to-screen adaptation, <em>Heartstopper</em> captured, well, our hearts when it landed on Netflix. Following a teen romance between Charlie Spring (Joe Locke) and Nick Nelson (Kit Connor), Season 1 and 3 boast a perfect score of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. Like <em>TSITP</em>, the series will conclude with a feature film titled <em>Heartstopper Forever</em>. </p>



<p><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Netflix</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>Dawson’s Creek</em></h2>







<p><em>Dawson’s Creek</em> is the OG teen series, which paved the way for love triangles, angst and drama. Fans have consistently compared Belly’s love triangle with Conrad and Jeremiah to the messy relationships between Dawson, Joey and Pacey. </p>



<p><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Hulu</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>We Were Liars</em></h2>







<p>Prime Video’s newest book-to-screen adaptation hit our screens in June this year, and it’s gripping from beginning to end. Starring Aussie Joseph Zada — who’s leading <em>The Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping</em> — and <em>One Tree Hill’s</em> Barbara Alyn Woods’ daughter Emily Alyn Lind, this mystery thriller will keep you on your toes. It follows Lind’s character Cadence Sinclair, after an amnesia-causing accident, as she tries to piece together what happened last summer. </p>



<p><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Prime Video</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>One Day</em></h2>







<p>If you thought Belly and Conrad’s slow-burning relationship spanning five years was agony, <em>One Day</em> focuses on a relationship between Emma (Ambika Mod) and Dexter (Leo Woodall) across 14 years. Playing heavily into the <em>will they, won’t they</em> trope, <em>One Day </em>is both infuriating and romantic, and could very well have you in tears by the end. </p>



<p><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Netflix</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>Never Have I Ever</em></h2>







<p>Mindy Kaling’s original show <em>Never Have I Ever</em> tackles many of the same themes as <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em>. Exploring grief, finding yourself, love and more, Devi Vishwakumar (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) is the heart of this show — much like Belly. Plus, Devi finds herself in an impossible love triangle between her fierce rival Ben (Jaren Lewison) and the hottest boy in school Paxton (Darren Barnet), with hijinks along the way.</p>

<p>As the famous saying goes, “Don’t just dream it, be it!” This expression rings true during October 6’s Super Full Harvest Moon in Aries. This rioting lunation brings us back to ourselves and helps us redefine our lives. We hold the power to become the person we are meant to be by<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/yearly-horoscope-2025""> transforming the way we view ourselves</a>. Without drama or fear, we are ready to spark our hearts and embrace ourselves with compassion and kindness. When we look in the mirror, we’ll adore the person we see. We hold the key to this amazing state of mind and glory. <br /><br />A supermoon occurs when the Moon is at perigee to Earth. You may be scratching your head, trying to figure out what the astronomical term means. I’m gonna save you a trip to Google and explain. Simply put: The Moon is closer to Earth than usual, making it appear larger than normal. So, if you’re looking at the night sky and thinking about why the Full Moon is bigger and brighter, it just means it is in a closer orbit to our planet. However, note that the emotional effects of the lunation might hit hard. This season has three supermoons: October 6, November 5, and December 4. </p>



<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/super-harvest-moon-in-aries-horoscope-september-2023"">Harvest Moon</a> is the Full Moon that occurs closest to the Fall Equinox (which was on September 22). This lunation is a time for farmers to secure their bounty and crops as we transition toward the year’s colder months. Spiritually, the Harvest Moon offers celebration, abundance, and blessings. We thank the Earth for its bounty and beauty before heading into the darker days. The Super Full Harvest Moon provides us with a moment of reflection and gratitude, in which we can move towards our inner cravings by balancing out our emotions. It’s a glorious time — no wonder Neil Young’s been crooning about this lunar glow-up for decades.<br /><br />The day of the Harvest Moon has a lot going on, astrologically. For starters, the communication planet, Mercury, dives into Scorpio. Mercury in Scorpio likes to have meaningful and intense discussions. This Mercurial placement is often suspicious of others, leading us to proceed cautiously when trusting others. Our passions will be ignited, even if we have trouble discussing them, as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/water-signs-zodiac-traits-explained"">the water sign</a> is less conversational and more intuitive.  We’ll lean into our emotions and gut feelings — especially when Mercury creates a minor frustration with Neptune retrograde in Aries. If something is off, listen to the voice within and move away from it.</p>



<p>Uranus retrograde in Gemini shares a gentle aspect with the North Node of Destiny, making us run away from the mundane and embrace change. Uranus is walking us up from the daze and haze we’ve been under, allowing us to revolutionize our personal philosophies about how we live and spend our time. We want to seek excitement and joy at all costs by throwing caution to the wind. Be careful not to get too reckless and impetuous because we may regret our decisions later and blame the Moon for our actions. </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/asteroids-astrology-horoscopes-meaning"">The asteroid Ceres</a> (which represents nurturing and TLC) links up with the Moon in Aries, urging us to put self-care and self-love at the top of our priorities. Focus on ventures that make you happy, even if they don’t align with the status quo. Revel in the company of people who challenge your ideology and offer new concepts. Live boldly and greatly — most importantly, unapologetically! <br /><br />The takeaway from the Super Full Harvest Moon in Aries is that we should exist on our own terms. Those who wish to silence us aren’t the people we need to surround us. We can create the dynamics we want and never settle for anything less than what our hearts deserve and desire. The energy will be high, pushing us to rush through our choices and jump into the next best thing or person that catches our fancy. However, it is advisable to watch matters unfold.  March to the beat of your own drum and embrace the most authentic versions of yourself. Cheers to that!</p>

<p>If epic pop culture moments like <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/barbie-brand-collaborations-2023"">Barbie</a></em> and <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-season-3-fashion-collaborations"">The Summer I Turned Pretty</a> </em>have taught us anything, it’s that a timely, well-executed collab can work wonders to transport and immerse viewers into the world of their favorite big- and small-screen characters. And if last year’s countless <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wicked-movie-brand-collaborations"">Wicked</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wicked-movie-brand-collaborations""> brand collections</a> are any indication, we’re gearing up for another season of green and pink everything with the forthcoming release of <em>Wicked: For Good</em>. And naturally, we can’t begin to talk about <em>Wicked </em>collections without mentioning Ariana Grande’s own makeup brand, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/04/10946075/ariana-grande-rem-beauty-ulta"">r.e.m. Beauty</a>.</p>



<p>If you, like me, have been voraciously consuming every morsel of <em>For Good</em> content as the November premiere date approaches, prepare yourselves; <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/featured/rembeauty_art2_wicked25"">r.e.m. Beauty x </a><em><a href=""https://www.ulta.com/featured/rembeauty_art2_wicked25"">Wicked: For Good</a> </em>is the ultimate beauty collection for you to <em>obsessulate</em> over. The <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/featured/rembeauty_art2_wicked25"">limited-edition capsule</a> features nine products, spanning blush trios, plumping lip glosses, metallic eyeliners inspired by the Emerald City, and a very special 12-pan eyeshadow palette inspired by the Ozian Forest — a locale that’s featured prominently in the sequel. Also noteworthy: Two makeup sets inspired by <em>For Good</em>‘s leading ladies, Glinda and Elphaba, with four full-size products each. </p>





<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936079.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>I personally consider myself a Glinda rising, Elphaba sun, and Nessarose moon, so I immediately gravitated towards the moody, earthy tones in the <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/elphaba-makeup-set-pimprod2054985?sku=2645275"">Elphaba Makeup Set</a> and the <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/elphaba-makeup-set-pimprod2054985?sku=2645275"">Ozian Forest Eyeshadow Palette</a>. For an everyday fall look, I used a couple matte neutral shades from the palette — a pale beige called “Confusifying,” “Witching Hour” (a warm tan), and “The Grimmerie” (a milk chocolate) in the crease. Then, I applied a plummy lip &amp; cheek tint from the Elphaba set (the shade is “Braverism,” which…love) as a lipstick and blush, and added the glossy balm in the shade Wickedness (a sheer brown with golden-magenta micro glitter) to round out the lip combo. I already happened to be wearing a green cardigan and my hair in a long braid, which totally brought the Elphaba vibes to life.</p>



<p>Another favorite from the collection is the greenish-gold “Elphie” shade of the <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/starlet-liquid-eyeshadow-pimprod2051262?sku=2637766"">Starlet liquid eyeshadows</a> (my all-time favorite product by the brand), worn underneath the gold metallic shade (“All Roads Lead To The Wizard”) from the Ozian Forest palette, paired with curled lashes and mascara for a statement eye look. </p>





<p>I was already a fan of r.e.m. Beauty, but if you haven’t yet tried the brand, I for one can’t think of a better time to get acquainted than now. You can already shop the full <em><a href=""https://www.ulta.com/featured/rembeauty_art2_wicked25"">Wicked: For Good</a></em><a href=""https://www.ulta.com/featured/rembeauty_art2_wicked25"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""> collection</a> on <a href=""https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/lfYFCBB7E0flV3rwtzfnt2ZwHP?domain=rembeauty.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">rembeauty.com</a>, and at Ulta Beauty stores and <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/featured/rembeauty_art2_wicked25"">online</a> on October 5.

If we've learnt anything from Ginnifier Goodwin, Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis movies<em>,</em> it's that the ""friends to lovers"" cliché is part of the golden trio of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/diversity-representation-rom-coms-lily-chu"">rom-com love stories</a>. Next to the ""enemies to lovers"" trope, and the ""random strangers brought together by fate"" story arc, of course.<br /><br />Making your friend a lover can certainly seem very appealing. There's the satisfaction you'd feel after your friend <em>finally</em> turns around to look at you like<em> that</em>. You've already established closeness and intimacy, and the release of any sexual tension that's been building up for who knows how long can be a relief. It's romantic, confidence-boosting and sexy — and it certainly makes for a really great story.<br /><br />But is it just that — a story? Does getting <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/should-you-date-friend"">romantically involved with a friend</a> really work in real life? While some people say that going from friends to something more creates an unbreakable foundation for a romantic relationship, others believe in the age-old concern that doing so might <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/02/11668705/friendship-breakdown-vacation-travel"">ruin the friendship</a> — and that's more important than anything else. <br /><br /><em>Refinery29 </em>spoke to 10 women about their experiences of going from friends to lovers, and what they learnt about love, sex and friendship along the way.<figure><figcaption><h2>Anwyn (she/they), 23<br /></h2><br />""As a theatre and English literature major, I am absolutely in love with the friends-to-lovers trope. It’s been every <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/situationships-dating-fulfilling-2"">example of a relationship, situationship</a>, crush and friends with benefits that I’ve ever had. I think I love it for many reasons, including that you can trust that person more easily, you know they preemptively already care about you and respect your dignity/autonomy, and also because you see them regularly and are often in social spaces with them.<br /><br />""Whilst it’s been good in that I’ve been able to retain the friendships with these people despite how it ends and love all the individuals deeply as mates, I’m also left feeling really sad because it didn’t eventuate into more of a serious or romantic connection. Because, at a certain point, the other person calls it [off] because they don’t want to lose our friendship, or I myself do the same.<br /><br />""Recently, I heard some wise words from one of my best friends who told me that maybe my love for this trope isn’t actually the best way for me to be navigating love and sex. Maybe instead, I should try going for people who don’t see me just as a friend, first and foremost. It’s pretty hard in reality for friends to lovers to work because friendships are equally as important as lovers, and the boundary between them is more critical than I previously thought.""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Bella (she/her), 23<br /></h2><br />""We were friends before we ever started dating, but he always felt like home to me. I always knew he loved me, but it took me a second to realise that I felt the same. As a teenager, I hadn’t learnt to associate those feelings — of safety and wanting to be with him all the time — with love. The moment I realized this was when he was driving me home one night. He was telling me about the time he broke his arm, and his dad drove him to the hospital. I had this distinct moment where I realized I didn’t want to miss him breaking a bone ever again. I wanted to be there for all of it — highs and lows. <br /><br />""The beautiful thing about going from friends to lovers is even when you’re lovers, you’re still friends. You still want to hang out with them, hear from them, trust them, and believe in them. In my opinion, it’s the best way to do it. Something hard, though, is that over time, it’s easy to fall back into a habit of just being best friends — and you have to work hard to keep up the intimacy of lovers. But it’s a pretty lovely default to fall back on. Could definitely be worse. ""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Sabrina (she/her), 24<br /></h2><br />""It all started happening very slowly. We were already good friends, but we started hanging out every day and, often, I would end up sleeping over because I didn't want to go home to face some things I was dealing with. It was all very gradual. It was a platonic sleepover to start, but over time, we would just inch a bit closer, and then all of a sudden we were secretly sleeping together. I never meant to fall for him. I didn't really think it would happen because I had a very 'I don't want to be in a relationship' mentality at the time. It was fun keeping it a secret, sneaking around. <br /><br />""Then, all of a sudden it had almost been a year, and I was still confused about what I was feeling. He told me he loved me, but just 'not like that'. He actually hooked up with someone else soon after this. All of a sudden, I was left picking up the pieces of my broken heart while trying to navigate what I was feeling. Our friends still didn't know about us, and I had to listen to everyone talk about him and this new girl; it was so painful, and I still feel the mental health repercussions of it to this day. Now, even though he's still around <em>a lot</em>, I'm trying hard to make sure there's some more distance and boundaries between us.""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Laura (she/her), 25<br /></h2><br />""I've been a little bit in love with one of my good friends for as long as I've known them. Not enough to distract me from dating other people or being interested in others, but it's always just lingering there in the background. The 'what if', the possibility — isn't that what makes all friend-to-lover experiences that little bit more exciting? It's often been a matter of timing. Whenever I'm in a relationship, she's not, and vice versa. But we've recently both become single and we've been playfully considering giving it a go.<br /><br />""It's a bit weird because you often have to be a lot franker with a friend if you want something more, instead of that subtle insinuation you have with someone who is already a dating prospect from the start. We've giggled and fumbled a lot as we try to work it out, and every now and then, I'm struck with a fear that we'll mess it all up. Sometimes I think if it was meant to happen it would have ages ago. But I guess we'll see.""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Siobhan (she/her), 27<br /></h2><br />""Trying to go from friends to lovers was one of the worst ideas I've ever had. It was just one of those situations where everything that made us good friends made us bad lovers. The way we used to playfully bicker and tease each other became actual fights. Going to the same parties and events every single week became frustrating instead of fun. What I learnt is that just because you might have sexual tension with someone, does <em>not </em>mean you'll work, or that you should actually pursue them. Sexual tension between friends is almost always gonna be there on some level if you're interested in each other's sex or gender, but more often than not, it's actually meant to just stay platonic.""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Tam (she/her), 25<br /></h2><br />""I’ve known my current partner for 20 years now. We met in the first year of primary school and drifted in and out of friend circles for years. Towards the end of high school, she came into my close friend group as she was dating a best friend of mine. They broke up near graduation, and when <em>we</em> started seeing each other in 2020, things were pretty difficult, seeing as there was that history amongst my friend group. It was quite on and off at the start, and it was even harder for us to have space from each other when we decided to take a break, as we were still in the same friend group. Since the start of 2020, everyone has become much more comfortable with it and we officially started dating — and things have been great ever since. Although, it is tough to have space and do my own thing sometimes as we're always hanging out...!""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Sara (she/her), 26<br /></h2><br />""I was <em>that </em>girl who didn't realise she liked her friend as more than a friend until he got into a serious relationship with someone else. There were many months of pining, tears and jealousy until they split (I swear I had nothing to do with it), and after a while, I decided to shoot my shot. We honestly had a great time together as more than friends. I can count it as one of the better relationships I've ever had. But it ultimately just didn't work — I don't know if it was because we were friends first or if it just wasn't meant to be, but it wasn't right. <br /><br />""I sometimes think I only sparked my attraction to him <em>because </em>he had become off-limits, and I wonder if it still would've happened if things had been different. I'm not a friends with your ex kind of girl, so no, we're not friends anymore. But I'm honestly okay with that. I think people come in and out of your life for different reasons and in different roles. Our time was just up (in more ways than one) but I'm ultimately grateful for the experience.""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Liv (she/her), 24<br /></h2><br />""Despite everyone<em> </em>in our lives suggesting we get together for so many years, we just didn't see it at the time. We had kissed once when we were teenagers but happily left it at that for almost a decade. We fell in love with other people over the years and just lived our lives as friends. I can't even describe how it happened, honestly. One day, when we were finally both single, we just turned around and saw it.<br /><br />""And I thank <em>God </em>that we were friends first. Not only is it just a great story with a really satisfying ending, but we've been communicating for so many years that we're really good at it now. He understands my history and my patterns <em>super </em>well without needing an explanation. I will say that it can be sad not to feel like we're really learning anything new about each other the way other couples might, and we fell into serious marriage-like couple status pretty quickly, so we didn't get that spark-filled stage as much. But we got the ultimate end result and I'm so fine with that.""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Amelia (she/her), 29<br /></h2><br />""My friend and I gave it a go romantically a few years ago, but it didn't end up working out. We'd both felt <em>so </em>much pressure from our friends to get together because we work well in so many ways. We partly got together because we were just curious to see what it would be like, and also because we just wanted everyone to leave us alone! But as is the way in any relationship (I think, especially when you're friends first), don't just get together with someone simply because it seems like a good idea to everyone else. Your relationships aren't meant to only please other people. Luckily, we're still friends now (though we had to take a year-long hiatus after our fling ended to give each other some space), but it could've gone much worse. While I don't regret it, I wouldn't do it again.""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Brie (she/her), 36<br /></h2><br />""I was friends with my partner for a couple of years before I realized that, actually, I wanted more than friendship. So I told him that and asked him out! We were not super close friends — we followed each other on socials and occasionally chatted there and caught up for drinks or dinner. I think our not being super close is what made the move from pals to partners easier. The hardest part was needing to adjust my perspective of him as I got to know him more intimately. Some of that was surprising but mostly it was great. We’ll celebrate four years together later this year, so I think it's fair to say things went pretty well!""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Nikki (she/her), 25</h2><br />""We've been friends since we were five years old. As we got older, we started having on-and-off flings over the years. I always thought, even before we were dating, that we were twin flames. We started sleeping together during COVID lockdowns, but I never thought I would end up with him. I never thought I was actually interested, but we caught feelings fast. It was a difficult transition because we had been friends for so long, and were cautious of ruining it and how it may affect our friends (as we're in the same friend group).<br /><br />""It was difficult because we knew we wanted to be with each other but also that it would be a serious commitment to each other because of our history. But, we made it work. Our love now is super intense and super passionate. It’s a deep love that is built on strong foundations of knowledge and understanding. I’ve never loved anyone this much. Complete and utter devotion. I am so thankful and grateful for it.""</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?</strong></p>",

Living in Orlando, it doesn’t really start to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fall-2025-fashion-beauty-trends-forecast""><em>feel</em> like fall</a> until the season’s already over and winter sets in, if we’re lucky. The crispy air, crunchy leaves, and sweater weather are more of a Pinterest board dream than a Florida reality.<br /><br />But Southern folks have our ways of faking fall: visiting pumpkin patches in 85-degree heat, weekend camping trips, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2014/10/76621/hocus-pocus""><em>Hocus Pocus</em></a><em> </em>movie nights with the electric fireplace crackling, and scares at Universal’s Halloween Horror Nights.<br /><br />Still, nothing tricks us into the spirit of autumn quite like scent. The smell of spiced apples and burnt sugar sends us right into an episode of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/11/129035/gilmore-girls-rewatching-show-new-opinion-love-hate""><em>Gilmore Girls</em></a>, even if we’re in shorts. That’s probably why candle sales spike in the fall. According to the National Candle Association, more than <a href=""https://candles.org/facts-figures-2/"">35% of candle sales</a> happen in the fourth quarter, with many candle brands beginning to see major increases in September. <br /><br />Scent is the strongest sense tied to memory. So fall candles do more than smell good — they transport us. Aromas like pumpkin chai or caramel pecan take us to a cozy kitchen filled with baked goods and warm mugs, while woodsy notes like cedar, amber, or smoke pull us into forests or bonfires.<br /><br />Whether you’re embracing crisp autumn changes or creating your own version of the season, these Latine-owned candles will help set the scene and the scent.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.
