<h4>The future of work in the age of AI and deepware.</h4><p>There is a photograph from 1930s East London that should be mandatory viewing for anyone anxious about AI taking their job. It shows Mary Smith, a “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knocker-up"">knocker-up</a>” — <strong>a woman whose entire profession consisted of walking the streets at dawn, shooting dried peas at bedroom windows with a long bamboo pole to wake workers for their factory shifts.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Photograph from 1930s showing Mary Smith, a “knocker-up,” wielding a bamboo pole with dried peas, shooting them at bedroom windows to wake factory workers."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*rkCJ0XioJKqdRXNE.jpg"" /><figcaption>Mary Smith, a “knocker-up” in East London (1930s)</figcaption></figure><p>Mary charged sixpence a week for this service. Then the alarm clock arrived, and Mary’s job vanished.</p><p>Do we mourn the knocker-up today? Do we rage against the tyranny of the alarm clock? Of course not. Because what happened to Mary is what has happened throughout every technological revolution: certain tasks became obsolete whilst entirely new categories of work emerged.</p><p>Yet here we are in 2025, gripped by the same ancient panic. <em>AI is coming for our jobs</em>, we are told. The robots will replace us. The future is bleak.</p><blockquote>Let me offer a different provocation: AI is not coming for your job. It is coming for your tasks. And if you cannot distinguish between the two, then yes — you should be worried.</blockquote><h3>The evolution we refuse to see</h3><p>Human work has always been in flux. In nomadic societies, we hunted and gathered. Agriculture tethered us to land and rhythms of seasons. Industrialisation moved us into factories, trading physical labour for wages. The information age shifted us again — this time from brawn to brain, from making things to managing data, information, and knowledge.</p><p>Each transition has redefined not just what we do, but what remains uniquely human about work. We moved from physical exertion to cognitive processing. Now we have built what I call “<a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/when-deepware-meets-wetware-the-uncomfortable-truth-about-responsible-ai-245842121749""><em>deepware</em></a>” — neural networks and machine learning systems layered atop our traditional software and hardware. <br />These architectures can process, pattern-match, and produce at speeds we cannot fathom. Yet in our rush to innovate, we have convinced ourselves that <em>deepware</em> can carry the weight of responsibility our <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetware_(brain)""><em>wetware</em></a> — our human brains and nervous systems — seems increasingly willing to surrender. We are moving again, but this time the question is whether we are moving forward or simply moving away.<br />Because this time, the shift is not from physical to mental. It is from execution to <strong><em>responsibility</em></strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""A horizontal timeline infographic titled “The Evolution of Human Work.” It shows five large coloured circles connected by a black arrow, each representing a stage of labor. Nomadic (Hunting): “Physical survival, hunt and gather.” Agricultural (Farming): “Tied to land and seasonal cycles.” Industrial (Factories): “From muscle to machine labour.” Information (Knowledge): “Brains over brawn: data and knowledge.” Deepware (Responsibility): “Execution shifts to responsibility and ethics.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ImgkXpy6k2_U53LUT5K7XQ.png"" /><figcaption>The evolution of work, from hunting to responsibility.</figcaption></figure><p>As <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Narayanan"">Arvind Narayanan</a> at Princeton observes, jobs are not monolithic entities. They are bundles of tasks. Some tasks are routine and susceptible to automation. Others require distinctly human qualities: judgement, ethics, accountability, wisdom.</p><p>The question is not whether AI can perform tasks. It demonstrably can, often better than we can. The question is who takes responsibility when those tasks produce consequences in the real world.</p><h3>Outputs are not outcomes</h3><p>This distinction matters more than most organisations realise.</p><p><strong>Output</strong> is what a process produces. Code. Copy. Designs. Legal briefs. Medical recommendations. Outputs are the tangible results of a system executing its programmed or prescribed function — the direct product of following steps, rules, or algorithms. The term emerged in the industrial era, literally describing the quantity of coal or iron a mine could extract in a given period. Output depends entirely on the efficiency and capability of the process that generates it.</p><p><strong>Outcome</strong> is what happens when that output meets reality. An outcome requires context, interpretation, application, and crucially — <em>intentionality</em>. Outcomes demand understanding not just what was produced, but why it matters, who it affects, and what consequences ripple from it. Where outputs measure productivity, outcomes measure impact. They are the ultimate change or consequence that results from applying an output with purpose and judgment.<br />AI can generate outputs. It cannot, however, create outcomes. Because outcomes require something <em>deepware</em> fundamentally lacks: the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetware_(brain)""><em>wetware</em></a> capacity for responsibility.</p><p>Computers cannot be held accountable, as IBM recognised in 1979. That truth has not changed. What has changed is our willingness to pretend otherwise.</p><figure><img alt=""IBM’s note stating: A computer can never be held accountable. Therefore a computer must never make a management decision."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*KxrF3PVHDs2TbLRh.png"" /><figcaption>IBM note, 1979</figcaption></figure><h3>The accountability vacuum</h3><p>We have already seen the cost of this pretension. A <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/06/03/attorneys-court-ai-hallucinations-judges/"">lawyer</a> in the US submitted AI-generated briefs filled with fabricated cases. A trial in <a href=""https://www.usnews.com/news/offbeat/articles/2025-08-15/australian-lawyer-apologizes-for-ai-generated-errors-in-murder-case"">Australia</a> was delayed because no one verified the AI’s outputs. These were not technological failures — these were failures of human responsibility.</p><p>When a professional says “the AI recommended it,” they are engaging in the same moral abdication as someone saying “I was just following orders.” Both statements attempt to transfer accountability to something — or someone — <a href=""https://emerge.digital/resources/ai-accountability-whos-responsible-when-ai-goes-wrong/"">incapable</a> of bearing it.</p><p>This is the dangerous seduction of <em>deepware</em>: it offers us the illusion that we can delegate not just tasks, but responsibility itself.</p><p>We cannot. We must not.</p><p>The future of work, then, is not about humans competing with AI for task execution. It is about humans stepping into roles where we exercise oversight, judgement, and accountability over the outputs that AI produces. This is not replacement. This is elevation.</p><p>But only if we prepare for it.</p><h3>The skills <em>deepware</em> cannot replicate</h3><p>Here is what the regulations already understand, even if organisations do not: responsible AI demands responsible humans. <br />The <a href=""https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai"">EU AI Act </a>mandates human oversight, transparency in decision-making, and clear accountability chains. Not as bureaucratic burden, but as fundamental safeguard.</p><p>Because here is the uncomfortable truth about <em>deepware</em>: it learns from historical data, which means it perpetuates historical biases.</p><p><a href=""https://www.cangrade.com/blog/hr-strategy/hiring-bias-gone-wrong-amazon-recruiting-case-study/"">Amazon’s</a> recruitment algorithm discriminated against women. <a href=""https://fairnow.ai/workday-lawsuit-resume-screening/"">Workday’s</a> hiring system did the same with 40+ candidates. <a href=""https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/even-a-small-typo-can-throw-off-ai-medical-advice-mit-study-says"">MIT</a> research found that AI healthcare systems told female patients they were more likely to “manage illness at home”. <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/search/can-you-review-this-article-an-G_Tc8IpkTOyF.Bj47m8IfQ"">Judicial</a> algorithms found Black defendants more culpable.</p><p>These are not glitches. These are features of systems trained on data that encoded decades of invisible discrimination.</p><p>So when we talk about the future of work, we are really talking about the future capacity of humans to think critically about the machines we build. To question their outputs. To interrogate their processes. To identify bias. To imagine consequences. To demand better.</p><p>This requires a different skill set entirely:</p><p><strong>Critical thinking: </strong>the ability to evaluate claims, identify assumptions, and distinguish correlation from causation.</p><p><strong>Systems thinking: </strong>understanding how components interact, how changes ripple, how second and third-order effects emerge.</p><p><strong>Lateral thinking: </strong>seeing connections across domains, applying insights from one context to another.</p><p><strong>Scenario planning: </strong>running mental simulations of possible futures, stress-testing decisions before implementation.</p><p><strong>Consequence thinking: </strong>asking not just “can we?” but “should we?” and “then what?”</p><p>Notice what these skills have in common. They are uniquely human. They require <em>wetware</em> that is fully engaged, not atrophied from disuse.</p><h3>The extension that could replace us</h3><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan"">Marshall McLuhan</a> wrote in 1967 that <em>“all technologies are extensions of our physical and nervous systems to increase power and speed.</em>” <br />The wheel extended our legs. The telescope extended our eyes. Now <em>deepware</em> extends our cognitive capacity.</p><p>But here is McLuhan’s warning, implicit in every page: when an extension becomes too powerful, we risk forgetting the limb it was meant to serve. We outsource function, and eventually, capability atrophies.</p><p>Consider the calculator. Brilliant tool. But an entire generation now cannot perform basic arithmetic without one. The extension has replaced the skill.</p><p>Now scale that to <em>deepware</em>. If we allow AI to think for us — to analyse, to recommend, to decide — without maintaining our own capacity to audit and override, we risk something far more dangerous than job loss. We risk becoming obsolete not because machines replaced us, but because we voluntarily stepped aside.</p><h3>The choice that defines the next era</h3><p>The future of work is not a future without humans. It is a future where humans do fundamentally different work: the <strong><em>work of being responsible</em></strong>.</p><p>This means verification before deployment. Critical thinking over speed. Systems thinking over isolated innovation. Accountability at every level.</p><p>It means training a generation not just to prompt AI, but to <em>interrogate</em> it. Not just to deploy models, but to <em>govern</em> them. Not just to consume outputs, but to construct meaningful <em>outcomes</em>.</p><p>It means recognising that as our <em>deepware</em> grows more sophisticated, our <em>wetware</em> must grow more rigorous. Every layer of AI we add demands an exponential increase in human oversight.</p><p>This is not optional. This is existential.</p><p>Mary Smith lost her job when the alarm clock arrived. But she did not lose her capacity for work — she adapted. Her children worked in offices, not on streets. Her grandchildren worked in roles she could never have imagined.</p><p>The same will be true for us, but only if we make a conscious choice: to remain conscious. To refuse the abdication of responsibility that <em>deepware</em> makes so seductively easy. To recognise that outcomes require human judgement in ways that outputs never will.</p><p>Our <em>wetware</em> remains the most sophisticated technology we possess. In the age of <em>deepware</em>, it is also the only thing preventing a future where machines own not just our code, but our agency.</p><p>The next time someone shows you what AI can do, we need to ask them something more important: who is responsible when it goes wrong?</p><p>Because in the end, the future of work depends not on what machines can produce, but on whether humans remember that we, and only we, can be held accountable for what happens next.</p><p><em>For a deeper exploration of the deepware-wetware framework and why responsible AI fundamentally depends on active human cognition, read: </em><a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/when-deepware-meets-wetware-the-uncomfortable-truth-about-responsible-ai-245842121749""><em>When Deepware meets Wetware: the uncomfortable truth about responsible AI</em></a></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a9293109b3be"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/when-machines-make-outputs-humans-must-own-outcomes-a9293109b3be"">When machines make outputs, humans must own outcomes</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

However, these days it appears not as a defiant rejection of values, but as a quiet erosion of purpose met with a shrug of apathy.</p><p>Ends are replaced by metrics, conviction by convenience, and narrative by feeds. Secularism, politics, ideology, and technology are often blamed. However, another force hides in plain sight — design.</p><p>If one had to describe what nihilistic design looks like, it would be sterile, stripped of conviction, void of meaning, and soulless.

What if culture is not simply echoed in design, but shaped by it? What if the sterile and hollow interfaces we produce today are not passive reflections of nihilism, but active producers of it?</p><p>This idea has deep philosophical roots. <a href=""https://www.wilde-online.info/the-decay-of-lying-page15.html"">Oscar Wilde once argued that life imitates art</a> far more than art imitates life. <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-aesthetics/"">Friedrich Nietzsche believed that aesthetics precede truth,</a> that existence itself is justified only as an aesthetic phenomenon. <a href=""https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/mcluhan.mediummessage.pdf"">Marshall McLuhan declared that the medium is the message,</a> and <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/baudrillard/"">Jean Baudrillard pushed it further</a>, claiming that signs and images no longer reflect reality but generate it.</p><p>If this is true, the pattern is unmistakable—design doesn’t just record meaning, it scripts it. And once design withers, culture follows close behind.</p><h4>From story to feed</h4><p>Cultural forms once carried narrative. Cathedrals told stories in stone and glass. Novels and films offered beginnings, middles, and ends that gave coherence to life. Even broadcast television moved within familiar arcs.</p><figure><img alt=""Panoramic view of Paris at sunset, highlighting the golden dome of Les Invalides and the modern Montparnasse Tower amidst historic architecture.

Much can be said about the bland architecture of our cities and the thinning narratives of contemporary movies and novels, but one of the most concerning shifts has been in the evolution of streaming television.</p><p>Television experiences that once delivered episodes with self-contained stories now lean heavily on season-long arcs—<a href=""https://medium.com/a-suburban-prison/why-are-tv-shows-canceled-9b95db46a4a4""> arcs that may never conclude if the series is canceled</a>. Stories hang suspended, deferred, or abandoned, and audiences grow accustomed to living with open loops, each pause just another cue to crave the next dopamine hit that never truly satisfies.</p><p>Nowhere are open loops more pervasive than the internet, especially social media. Here, design has abandoned narrative architecture altogether. Scroll-based feeds deliver hours of endless, unresolved experience. Search itself has become infinite — every query spawning new links, new threads, new rabbit holes without finality. These systems do not merely reflect shortened attention spans—they train us into them.</p><p>What’s lost in this shift is the <a href=""https://medium.com/digital-media-society-spring-2020/the-impact-that-streaming-sites-have-on-society-ef45c37f2efe"">collective experience</a>. Once, cultural scarcity bound people together — shared stories, shared rituals, shared meanings that culminated. Meaning deepened because it was finite, because it felt resolved. Now we chase a superficial sense of significance in the infinite. But infinity never resolves. It offers no closure, only the perpetual lure of what lies just beyond.</p><h4>The myth of neutrality</h4><p>Minimalism and modernism complicate the story further. These movements, and their descendants in today’s flat digital interfaces, often parade as neutral. The grid, the sans serif, the clean white background — all claim to transcend culture, to present the universal. But neutrality is a myth. Every omission is a worldview.</p><p>By removing ornament, context, and symbol, design does not simply clear space for function — it establishes an aesthetic where emptiness itself becomes a virtue. This virtue is not neutral—it is rooted in Western Enlightenment ideals of rationality and order. A stripped-down interface tells us that depth is clutter, that meaning is noise, that efficiency is the highest good.</p><p>This unraveling of layered meaning now reaches even long-form writing. Articles like this, which should invite reflection, are met with readers possessed by the demand for expediency — brevity, punch, imagery. Platforms like Instagram and X (Twitter) have trained us to crave immediacy over depth. Pictures replace paragraphs, glances replace grasp, and culture learns to settle for surfaces.</p><h4>Reason without conviction</h4><p>What makes this drift even more insidious is the way design has cloaked itself in the language of reason. Research, usability testing, and A/B experiments all serve as proof that design is objective. Yet philosophy has long shown that reason cannot prove itself.</p><p>As <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/"">Immanual Kant</a> observed, reason always bumps against the limits of what it can justify. <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/"">David Hume</a> warned that no amount of empirical observation can bridge the gap from “is” to “ought.” <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel/"">Kurt Gödel</a> demonstrated that even mathematics, the purest structure of reason, contains truths that cannot be proven within its own system. And <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/"">Nietzsche</a> reminded us that what we take as “truth” often conceals underlying values and power.</p><p>When design insists that data is its foundation, it forgets that even data rests on faith — in our senses, our instruments, and our frameworks. What presents itself as objectivity quickly slides into <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/"">relativism</a>, guided not by conviction but by whichever metric performs best in an experiment. Meaning evaporates in the process. Usability without story, efficiency without soul — these become the hallmarks of design that has abandoned belief in meaning itself.</p><figure><img alt=""Cartoon of two men analyzing a dashboard with charts. A janitor nearby discards a paper.

It is statistically coherent but culturally vacant, a reflection of averages without values.</p><p>Scaled up, these outputs flood culture with forms that only pretend to carry meaning. The danger is not simply their hollowness, but the way they train us to accept hollowness as normal.</p><p>Worse, their conversational mimicry — the illusion of a voice that “understands” — <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/building-trust-in-opaque-systems-ce38cef741b6"">creates trust where none is warranted</a>. We begin to trust the simulation of meaning rather than meaning itself.</p><p>When design can be generated in seconds, we learn to value speed over depth, convenience over conviction. The more we consume forms without substance, the more we adapt to their vacancy.</p><p>AI doesn’t just produce empty surfaces — it trains us to stop expecting meaning at all. And that quiet erosion of expectation is what makes it an accelerant of nihilism.</p><h4>Design as an engine of nihilism</h4><p>In contemporary design the inversion becomes clear. It doesn’t merely display nihilism — it drives it. Infinite feeds manufacture distraction. Minimalist sameness recasts emptiness as elegance. AI systems hint at human replaceability and then condition us to accept it.</p><p>Today’s interfaces aren’t passive reflections of culture. They script the way we see, think, and value. In their hollow repetitions they embed a lesson— nothing lasts, everything is disposable, and meaning is irrelevant.</p><p>Once these forms take hold, culture completes the circuit. Users absorb the cues and stop expecting depth. The less story, symbolism, or conviction design provides, the more indulgent such elements appear when they do surface.</p><p>The loop accelerates until the pursuit of meaning seems archaic. Emptiness is marketed as efficiency, even clarity. And here lies the danger—nihilism does not remain an abstract idea but becomes a lived condition.</p><p>At that point design doesn’t follow culture — it steers it, training us not only to live without meaning but to stop wanting it. That is how nihilism, once a philosophical diagnosis, becomes the default atmosphere of everyday life. And sadly, we are in the midst of such decay.</p><h4>Toward a design of meaning</h4><p>If this diagnosis is right, then design carries more responsibility than we often admit. It is not neutral. It is not merely reactive. It is formative. Which means that if design has played a role in producing nihilism, it can also play a role in resisting it.</p><p>The challenge is not to restore some lost objectivity — that foundation never existed. The challenge is to create values where none are given. Nietzsche saw this as the only way through nihilism — to become creators of meaning rather than its mourners.</p><p><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kierkegaard/"">Søren Kierkegaard</a>, too, understood that escaping despair required more than reason—it demanded a leap of faith, an act of commitment that could not be justified in advance.</p><p>For design, that means reintroducing narrative into interfaces, reclaiming symbolism, and insisting that even in a secular and fragmented modern society, design can be an act of conviction rather than resignation. Meaning doesn’t emerge from an infinite feed of possibilities but from forms that resolve, gestures that culminate, and experiences that cohere.</p><p>Some designs already gesture in this direction. <a href=""https://duolingo-papers.s3.amazonaws.com/reports/Duolingo_whitepaper_duolingo_method_2023.pdf"">Duolingo, for example, transforms small units of repetition into a narrative of progress</a> — each lesson resolves, each milestone carries symbolic weight. It shows that interfaces need not be hollow loops of engagement, but can script arcs of meaning that accumulate over time.</p><figure><img alt=""“Left side: An orange flame and ‘5 day streak’ indicate practice consistency.

Every decision is ethical labyrinth. Every omission shapes culture. Every interface is an argument about how meaning works. If our designs are hollow, they will train us into hollowness. If they carry conviction, they will cultivate conviction.</p><h4>Choosing meaning</h4><p>We like to say design reflects culture, but that’s only half the truth. Culture also reflects design. And the interfaces we are building today don’t just echo nihilism — they embed it, normalize it, and accelerate it. The real question isn’t whether design has agency, but whether designers are willing to own the meanings they create — or the voids they leave behind.</p><p>Part of the work is rhetorical. Designers can <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/rhetorical-triangle/"">learn to reframe meaning</a> as a kind of metric in itself — arguing that coherence builds retention, that conviction breeds loyalty. If the industry only speaks numbers, then one task is to translate values into that language without losing the values themselves.</p><p>If we refuse that responsibility, our interfaces will go on teaching the same lesson, swipe after swipe—that meaning itself is negotiable, optional, disposable. And the more we live inside those lessons, the more we risk losing the very capacity to imagine life beyond the abyss.</p><p><strong><em>Don’t miss out! </em></strong><a href=""https://micbuckcreative.medium.com/subscribe""><strong><em>Join my email list</em></strong></a><strong><em> and receive the latest content.</em></strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4b8617293462"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/contemporary-design-doesnt-just-reflect-nihilism-it-creates-it-4b8617293462"">Contemporary design doesn’t just reflect nihilism, it creates it.</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

In that talk, Fabricant revealed a simple yet powerful insight:</p><blockquote><strong>as designers, what we work with is behavior, shaping it, understanding it, and ultimately impacting lives.</strong></blockquote><p>His words have stayed with me over the years, guiding my journey as a designer and researcher in the fields of HCI and Interaction Design.</p><p>Time has passed. I’ve worked across various companies and projects, yet Fabricant’s phrase, <strong><em>“Behavior is our medium,”</em></strong> resonates now more than ever. Too often, those of us in design are consumed by efficiency metrics, conversions, and growth. You know the acronyms well: CAC, NPS, CSAT, LTV, ARPA, WAU, MAU, the endless race of numbers. It’s easy to get lost designing for what drives revenue or satisfies stakeholders. I understand; this is the reality of capitalism. I don’t view design purely from a ‘romantic’ perspective.</p><p>I believe good design must generate value and revenue, both for people and for the company. But that’s not the point I want to focus on in this article. Stay with me as we explore something deeper.</p><h3>Behavior change</h3><p>Behavior change, or <a href=""https://books.google.no/books/about/Principles_of_Behavior_Modification.html?id=dPRGAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y"">behavior modification (Bandura, 1970)</a>, is a branch of behavioral science that draws on fields such as cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience, economics, and other social science disciplines to understand, influence, and alter human actions.</p><p>Defining behavior change is a complex task, as many researchers offer differing definitions. Here, however, I want to propose a different approach: to separate the term “behavior change” into two distinct parts.</p><p>First, we need to clarify what we mean by behavior. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines it as any observable action in response to stimuli, or the way in which something functions.</p><p>The notion of “change,” on the other hand, implies a shift in habits, attitudes, or routines. This definition should help us establish a common ground moving forward.</p><p>Over time, key thinkers such as <a href=""https://www.verywellmind.com/operant-conditioning-a2-2794863"">Skinner</a> (1932), <a href=""https://books.google.no/books/about/Principles_of_Behavior_Modification.html?id=dPRGAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y"">Bandura</a> (1970), <a href=""https://online.yu.edu/wurzweiler/blog/prochaska-and-diclementes-stages-of-change-model-for-social-workers"">Prochaska &amp; DiClemente</a> (1983) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion"">Kahneman &amp; Tversky</a> (1991) <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/764008.763957"">Fogg</a> (2001), <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235413094_NUDGE_Improving_Decisions_About_Health_Wealth_and_Happiness"">Thaler &amp; Sunstein</a> (2009), <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19135907/"">Fjeldsoe</a> (2009), and <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597820303848"">Duckworth</a> (2016) have shaped the field, highlighting behavior change as a pathway to better outcomes for individuals, society, and the planet.</p><p>Yet, while behavior can be studied objectively, it is inevitably influenced by subjective factors, personal perceptions, internal beliefs, and cultural norms. For instance, changing energy-use habits may depend on how people perceive cost savings (<strong>perception</strong>), why they care about sustainability (<strong>belief</strong>), and the cultural value placed on nature (<strong>context</strong>).</p><p>In HCI/IxD, even if it is not always explicitly acknowledged by practitioners, behavior is central to the user experience. We cannot discuss UX without addressing user behavior. When we design the UI or the information architecture of a digital product, we are inherently shaping behavior.</p><p>Although rooted in longstanding theory, behavior change in HCI and IxD is a relatively recent focus, especially when we consider that the commercial internet only began in the late 1990s, followed by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble"">the dot-com boom</a> of the early 2000s. The application of behavior change in digital products remains an emerging area. As <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3603497"">Rapp et al.</a> (2023) point out, it is only in recent years that design has begun to seriously explore how technology can drive behavioral shifts, spurred by digital advances and a growing recognition of human factors in design.</p><p>Today, designers frequently employ behavior change techniques, evidence-based methods grounded in psychology and social science, as key components in interventions aimed at shaping user behavior. Yet, many of these efforts fail to produce meaningful or lasting change.</p><p>For instance, the use of game elements such as leaderboards, stars, points, and visual cues may capture users’ attention temporarily, but these techniques often do not sustain long-term engagement or behavioral impact. I don’t want to discourage designers. Rather, I believe we should embrace behavior change as a vital discipline within design.</p><p>Behavior should be treated as a design material, just as technology once became our material. If we use behavior thoughtfully, we can create better products. More than that, I believe there is a broader and more meaningful opportunity before us: to design for behavior. Not to make people addicted to products, but to help them grow as human beings, better parents, citizens, students, and professionals. Because if behavior is our medium, then design is our tool for empowerment.</p><h3><strong>Behavior as design material</strong></h3><p>Merriam-Webster defines material as the elements, constituents, or substances of which something is composed or can be made, or something (such as data) that may be worked into a more finished form.</p><p>In design, materiality refers to the qualities, affordances, and constraints of the substances or media through which designers give form to ideas. Traditionally, this included wood, metal, fabric, or plastic, tangible materials whose properties shape what is possible.</p><p>In HCI/IxD, materiality extends beyond the physical to include computation, code, data, time, and interaction patterns, each carrying its own “material” characteristics. As Wiberg (2017) explains, a material can be anything, physical or immaterial, that designers can shape to facilitate interaction between the user and the system. Similarly, Norby (2011, p. 4) argues that “<a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289345018_Between_the_tag_and_the_screen_redesigning_short-range_RFID_as_design_material"">for industrial and interaction designers, computational technology may be seen as materials that can be used to shape designs.</a>” Historically, as Wiberg (2017, p. 6) emphasizes, “<a href=""https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262037518/the-materiality-of-interaction/"">materiality has always been a central concern in interaction design, influencing how interactions are structured and experienced</a>”.</p><p>A design material is any medium that designers manipulate to create form, meaning, and experience. To function as a design material, it should possess qualities that can be explored and appropriated, impose constraints that guide creativity, and enable expression in interaction. Researchers in HCI have argued that computation and interaction themselves are design materials because they actively shape what design outcomes can emerge.</p><p>From this perspective, materiality is a central component for interaction designers. However, beyond computational materials, there is a growing recognition that behavior itself can be considered a design material. Behavior includes both <strong>system behavior — how a digital or physical system acts and responds</strong>, and <strong>user behavior — how people act within or in response to the system. </strong>As <a href=""https://fall14se.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/alan-cooper-robert-reimann-david-cronin-christopher-noessel-about-face_-the-essentials-of-interaction-design-wiley-2014.pdf"">Cooper</a> (2007) emphasized, systems must respond appropriately to user actions, making behavior a cornerstone of design.</p><p>This is where the materiality of behavior reveals its unique complexity. Unlike wood or code, human behavior is inherently unpredictable and contextual. It carries its own agency, is shaped by emotions, and is influenced by several external factors.</p><p>Designing with behavior, therefore, is a dynamic and relational practice: the designer carefully sculpts the system’s behavior with the intention of influencing, guiding, or facilitating certain user actions, while recognizing that the outcome is always a co-creation, a dialogue between the system’s rules and the user’s unpredictable will.</p><p>Behavior has distinct qualities such as timing, rhythm, predictability, and adaptability. It also constrains what is possible, as the way a system behaves defines which actions become meaningful for the user. Moreover, behavior is expressive: a robot moving slowly and smoothly communicates friendliness, whereas abrupt and jerky movement communicates aggression. Unlike static materials, behavior unfolds over time, meaning designers sculpt temporal patterns as deliberately as physical form.</p><p>A practical example of this dynamic is Duolingo’s “streak.” The designed system behaves as a visual counter that increments daily and resets to zero if a lesson is missed, directly seeking to shape user behavior by fostering a daily learning habit. This visual cue leverages psychological principles such as <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165176524000399"">loss aversion</a> and the satisfaction of maintaining progress to promote consistency. It exemplifies behavior as a material: the designer is intentionally shaping the properties of human motivation to “sculpt” a desired routine.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows the goal-setting calendar."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*lyeIALmaRQZ8SKyX.gif"" /><figcaption>Streak Goal-Setting Calendar. Source: <a href=""https://dribbble.com/alisale"">Alisa Le</a></figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, interaction design is less about static objects and more about how things and people behave toward one another. In this sense, behavior is not a byproduct but the very substance of interaction design. It is a design material because it carries properties, constraints, and expressive potential that designers can intentionally shape, just like wood, metal, or code.</p><h3>The focus should remain on Human</h3><p>Design, technology, and computing are ultimately about people. Design is created by people, for people, and with people, not the other way around. Yet so much of what we build today fails to support what truly matters to individuals. <strong>Why, in an age of intelligent systems and smart computing, are we still primarily designing for task completion and efficiency?</strong> <strong>Why is interaction design so often stuck in a mindset of consumption?</strong></p><p>We should be designing for transformation to make interactions between people and technology smoother, more meaningful, and more human. This could mean creating systems that foster deep focus instead of constant interruption, that support memory augmentation rather than replacement, or that facilitate genuine connection.</p><blockquote>Technology should not be a cage. It should be a set of wings.</blockquote><p>Instead, we too often create systems that trap users in loops of distraction and consumption. Look around: technology has made us faster and more efficient, yes. But it has also made many of us more anxious, disconnected, and dependent. For countless users, hours are lost to social media feeds instead of invested in rich, real-world interaction. We are outsourcing cognition, offloading memory, letting machines think for us. That is not an empowering future; it is a cage.</p><p>As designers, our focus must remain on humans. We carry the responsibility to design for both human needs and business needs, balancing them while always grounding our work in human well-being as a non-negotiable foundation.</p><p>As interaction designers, we have a responsibility to use technology to empower, not to confine. And yet, look at us now: we are becoming trapped, uncertain, drifting. The algorithm is leading; we have forgotten that it is we who must define how the algorithm interacts with humans, not the other way around.</p><h3>Designing for behavior change</h3><p>Although there is a wide range of techniques and methods available for designing behavior change, many designers still lack the skills to apply them effectively. First, when approaching behavioral science in design, or behavior design, designers often encounter significant challenges. For some, behavior change feels “too scientific,” requiring a foundation of knowledge they may not yet possess. Moreover, behavior itself is complex, making it difficult to translate theory into practice.</p><p>Second, many designers rely heavily on pre-defined tools such as cognitive biases or behavior design pattern libraries, but struggle to develop their own understanding or creative approach to behavior change. Finally, despite the existence of influential models such as the <a href=""https://behaviordesign.stanford.edu/resources/fogg-behavior-model"">Fogg Behavior Model</a>, the <a href=""https://www.prodpad.com/glossary/hook-model/"">Hook Model</a>, and the <a href=""https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/organizational-behavior/the-com-b-model-for-behavior-change"">COM-B Model</a>, the field still lacks well-defined heuristics and design techniques that can be consistently applied in practice. As a result, applying these frameworks in real-world projects remains a major challenge for designers.</p><p>Although designing for behavior change is challenging, when we as designers consciously treat behavior as a design material, we open the door to creating a deeper and more lasting impact on both people and the planet. Designing products and services that guide people toward positive outcomes requires a solid understanding of human behavior.</p><p>As Niedderer et al. (2018, p. 10) point out, “<a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319329313_Design_for_Behaviour_Change_Theories_and_Practices_of_Designing_for_Change"">designing for behavior change is not a new concept; it’s well-rooted in design practice.</a>” Since the late 19th century, and throughout the 20th century, thinkers like <a href=""https://monoskop.org/images/f/f8/Papanek_Victor_Design_for_the_Real_World.pdf"">Papanek</a> (1971) and <a href=""https://mcdonough.com/writings/building-better-world-making-people-smile/"">McDonough</a> (2002) have explored how design can influence human choices and actions.</p><p>More recently, this conversation has expanded into the domain of interaction design, where scholars such as <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/764008.763957"">Fogg</a> (2001), <a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=908493"">Lockton</a> (2005), <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222616442_Design_for_sustainable_behaviour_strategies_and_perceptions"">Lilley</a> (2009), and <a href=""https://medium.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fpublication%2F319329313_Design_for_Behaviour_Change_Theories_and_Practices_of_Designing_for_Change"">Niedderer et al.</a> (2018) have advanced the field by exploring how digital products can be intentionally crafted to shape user behavior in meaningful ways.</p><p>Traditionally, design was closely associated with the creation of physical objects or visual communication. From a linguistic perspective, the verb <strong><em>to design</em></strong> implies crafting something with purpose and intention. As McDonough (1992) stated, <a href=""https://mcdonough.com/writings/the-hannover-principles/"">design is the first signal of human intention.</a> <a href=""https://brasil.uxdesign.cc/quando-a-intencao-orienta-o-design-3c603728254f"">Every product we encounter in the world carries with it the intentions, whether conscious or not, of the designer or team that created it (Nzongo, 2022).</a></p><p>As a practitioner, I see design as a powerful and flexible tool that can be approached from multiple angles to support and influence behavior change through thoughtfully crafted products and experiences. Design isn’t just about form or function; it’s about shaping interactions, decisions, and ultimately, outcomes.</p><p>Niedderer et al. (2018, p. 11) capture this well when they state, “<a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319329313_Design_for_Behaviour_Change_Theories_and_Practices_of_Designing_for_Change"">The capacity of a designer lies in creating change through design by transforming the existing situation into a preferred one.</a>” In this sense, design becomes a form of intentional intervention, an opportunity to shift the current state of things toward something better, whether that means encouraging more sustainable habits, improving well-being, or supporting meaningful social change.</p><blockquote>Design for behavior change represents the next frontier in design.</blockquote><p>We must adopt a broader perspective, as Norman (1984) did when connecting design to behavior, emphasizing that artifacts are created to facilitate actions through their physical, symbolic, or social functions. From this viewpoint, design inherently drives transformation, shaping attitudes and behaviors.</p><p>Niedderer et al. (2018, p. 9) highlight this transformative power, arguing that design has shaped modern society and continues to influence behavior in profound ways. Forcato (2015, p. 78) reinforces this perspective, noting that “<a href=""https://www.infodesign.org.br/infodesign/article/view/302"">design has always influenced behavior, whether intentionally or not.</a>”</p><p>Designing for behavior change isn’t just an idealistic goal; it’s a necessity. As Fabricant points out, behavior is our medium, and we should be using it to empower individuals and transform our communities. <strong>If behavior is the medium, then design is the tool for shaping it.</strong> <a href=""https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.destud.2016.10.001"">By applying behavior change techniques and social theory</a>, we have the potential to design digital products that go far beyond surface-level aesthetics. I truly believe we can and should create tools that support deeper, more meaningful change.</p><h3>Designing for fitness habits</h3><p>In this project, I applied principles from social psychology and behavioral science to design a fitness app focused on fostering long-term well-being, not just logging workouts. The goal was to create a system that supports intrinsic motivation and sustainable habit formation.</p><p>The design leverages two interconnected features: progressive self-monitoring and a meaningful achievements system, grounded in a cohesive theoretical framework.</p><h4>Fostering intrinsic motivation through self-monitoring and identity</h4><p>At the core of the design lies the principle of self-monitoring, a key technique in the <a href=""https://aisel.aisnet.org/cais/vol24/iss1/28/"">persuasive systems design</a> (PSD) model. The app enables users to track their performance and compare progress against personal goals.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows a training monitoring app interface featuring a progress chart, performance metrics, goal indicators, and an avatar that allows users to visualize their body evolution over time."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oGoPJTBntiwJVefS3vsk4w.png"" /><figcaption>Designed by: Filipe Nzongo (2024)</figcaption></figure><p>This continuous feedback loop is crucial for sustaining motivation. According to <a href=""https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/SDT/documents/2000_RyanDeci_SDT.pdf"">self-determination theory</a> (SDT) (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985), such feedback fosters positive emotions like satisfaction and pride as users observe their own improvement, directly strengthening their sense of competence, a fundamental pillar of intrinsic motivation.</p><p>To strengthen this connection, the app incorporates a 3D avatar as a virtual representation of the user. This feature leverages the <a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/15554120231202175"">proteus effect</a>, a psychological phenomenon in which individuals unconsciously begin to align their behavior with the identity of their avatar. This “imagined self” acts as a powerful, internalized motivator, reinforcing commitment by allowing users to visualize their future, healthier selves.</p><h4>Reinforcing progress with a theory-driven reward system</h4><p>The motivation generated through self-monitoring is further reinforced by a carefully designed achievements system. While badges act as external rewards, their true power lies in their ability to validate effort and signify mastery. This aligns with <a href=""https://www.jstor.org/stable/254999"">expectancy theory</a> (Behling &amp; Starke, 1973), which suggests that motivation is driven by the belief that effort leads to success — badges make this “success” tangible.</p><p>Additionally, the system operates on the principles of <a href=""https://www.potentialunearthed.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Reinforcement-Theory.pdf"">positive reinforcement</a> (Skinner, 1938), where desirable behaviors, such as consistent training, are followed by a rewarding outcome. The ultimate aim, however, is to guide users from external reinforcement toward internal satisfaction. By visualizing achievements, the system strengthens the user’s sense of competence, thereby continuing to support the intrinsic motivation emphasized in <a href=""https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/SDT/documents/2000_RyanDeci_SDT.pdf"">self-determination theory</a> (SDT).</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows the training app interface where users can view the badges they have earned during workouts, which they can share on social media."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DKSW8fYpWVwadh2PMB7soQ.png"" /><figcaption>Designed by: Filipe Nzongo (2024)</figcaption></figure><p>This project exemplifies how interaction designers can move beyond surface-level aesthetics to create products that facilitate meaningful, positive change. By consciously applying behavior change principles using self-monitoring to build competence, an avatar to support identity, and achievements to reinforce progress, we can create tools that empower users and support their long-term well-being. It is a practical demonstration of using behavior as a design material with intention and responsibility.</p><p>Read more about the <a href=""https://medium.com/ux-user-experience-design-em-portugues/tecnologia-persuasiva-projetando-produtos-que-mudam-h%C3%A1bitos-0981011113af""><strong>project details at this link.</strong></a></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>We can’t limit ourselves to designing only for task completion or task success. This approach is becoming outdated. It’s time to look toward a new horizon and embrace behavior as a design material.</p><p>As intelligent systems (AI) become increasingly prevalent, understanding human behavior is no longer optional; it is essential. Our responsibility as practitioners grows: we are not only shaping how these systems behave, but also influencing the behaviors humans develop when interacting with them. As designers, we must acknowledge this impact.</p><p>Every screen, every system, and every micro-interaction represents an opportunity to shape behavior. In essence, we are already designing behavior. The critical question, then, is not whether we influence behavior, but what kind of behavior we are enabling and with what intention.</p><p>Designing for behavior change is not about control; it is about care. It requires using our tools, research, empathy, theory, and craft to act responsibly and intentionally. As we move further into an age of AI and autonomous systems, the choices we make today will shape the habits, values, and actions of tomorrow.</p><p>Let’s choose to design for good. Let’s choose to design for change. Because when we design for behavior, we’re not just designing experiences — we’re shaping futures.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=6d143562c909"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/behavior-is-our-medium-6d143562c909"">Behavior is our medium</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>What I learned about AI in design-dev collaboration through hands-on experiments and a 3-month thesis project, and why it led me to DesignOps.</h4><figure><img alt=""A seated woman, viewed from behind, working at a desk with multiple screens"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*H3j5Ozk4BOTHFd6ca_D9JA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>As the only designer on the team, seeing my developer colleagues deliver quickly thanks to AI made me consider ways to adapt. However, my thesis research led me in a different direction… <em>Credit: Unsplash.</em></figcaption></figure><p>“UX is dead.”</p><p>As a UX designer with a background in front-end development, I was struck by this phrase that kept popping up on LinkedIn. It also worried me a little for my future. But who exactly had killed UX?</p><p>The culprit seemed obvious: generative AI. Developers were embracing it faster than designers (or so <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7328018930592034816/?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A%28urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7328018930592034816%2CFEED_DETAIL%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse%29"">I read</a>). I realised that I used AI a lot when I was coding but barely touched it in my design work. Meanwhile, my developer colleague, an AI power user, was releasing features faster than ever.</p><p>This observation led me to a question that became the starting point of my thesis at <em>Les Gobelins Paris</em>: <strong>How could I, as the only designer on my team, keep pace and stay relevant in this changing environment?</strong></p><h3>The research that changed my mind</h3><p>I spent three months, from June to August 2025, actively investigating this question through my thesis. Many resources have shaped my understanding of AI and collaboration, from books such as <a href=""https://www.thedesignconductors.com/"">The Design Conductors</a> to articles like <a href=""https://blog.prototypr.io/dev-designer-collaboration-framework-bdef12799513"">Dev-Design Collaboration Framework</a> or <a href=""https://medium.com/%40INI8labs/how-ai-tools-are-bridging-the-gap-between-product-thinking-and-frontend-code-059896c8c858"">How AI Tools Are Bridging the Gap Between Product Thinking and Frontend Code</a>.</p><p>Building on these foundations, my approach was deliberately comprehensive. For internal research at my company, I conducted AI experiments, tried various tools, and led three field tests at three crucial collaboration stages: scoping, prototyping and handoff. For external validation, I ran an online survey to which 28 designers answered, and conducted 6 interviews with designers and developers.</p><p>But the results surprised me. I expected to confirm my fears, developers racing ahead while designers fell behind. However, this observation wasn’t validated. That’s when I thought: <strong>Do designers really need to be faster and more productive?</strong></p><p>I understood that before finding ways to adapt, I needed to understand what AI really had changed between designers and developers. I refined my angle to a more relevant one: <strong>How is generative AI reshaping collaboration between designers and developers, from the scoping phase to the handoff?</strong></p><p>This reflection ultimately led me to view AI less as an isolated tool and more as an organizational topic (DesignOps).</p><h3>What I discovered</h3><p>Allow me to introduce the three members of the ‘product trio’ that will assist me in presenting my results:</p><ul><li>Marie, a passionate designer who is curious about AI</li><li>Tony, an astute developer who’s also an absolute fan of AI</li><li>John, Product Manager, who loves collaborating with his team</li></ul><h3>1. AI makes individuals faster, not teams better</h3><p>Marie represents 77% of designers using AI in my survey who reported speed gains since adopting it. She uses ChatGPT for interview guides and Figma Make for rapid prototyping. In one test, I reduced my prototyping time from two days to two hours using AI.</p><figure><img alt=""A graph showing the survey percentages of answers to How AI has changed Work Pratices"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*V38YLBlYyWPu4kk0OKuJcg.png"" /><figcaption>Credit: Anna Lefour, with ClaudeAI.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>What I found interesting:</strong> Marie’s relationship with Tony didn’t change at all. Both my data and interviews confirmed this pattern. AI frees up individual time, but teams rarely reinvest those savings into better collaboration. It’s rather used to focus on tasks that are seen as more valuable, like understanding users’ needs or developing strategic thinking.</p><h3>2. AI augments rather than replaces (for now)</h3><p>When Marie tried AI prototyping, she hit walls quickly. The tool sometimes ignored parts of her design system, created visual inconsistencies, and missed her design intentions. Tony experienced similar frustrations with AI-generated code that was more difficult to understand and failed to meet the company’s or his own quality standards.</p><p>In my handoff experiment, I tested how a developer approached a traditional Figma file versus one created with Figma MCP + Cursor. The developer I worked with found the traditional approach clearer and easier to interpret.</p><p><strong>What became clear</strong>, though, was AI’s potential as a thinking partner. For the scoping phase, I conducted a “synthetic developer” test (an idea based on the <a href=""https://medium.com/@lwowa.creator/synthetic-users-a-tool-for-progress-or-a-step-too-far-2db4e95ebb4c"">synthetic user</a> experimentations), using ChatGPT to simulate developer feedback during scoping sessions. While it couldn’t match my real colleagues’ depth, it helped me prepare better questions and spot blind spots I’d missed.</p><figure><img alt=""A persona description in french that has been used in the writers’ synthetic dev test"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9KjqsGBGoFuUbT1E9LIkew.png"" /><figcaption><em>My ‘synthetic developer’ persona was called Tim and was created to simulate developer feedback during the scoping process. I asked ChatGPT to embody Tim. I created a persona that matched the expertise level of the real developers. </em>Credit: Anna Lefour.</figcaption></figure><p>John, our PM, found similar value in AI prototyping. Even imperfect prototypes helped our ‘product trio’ to iterate and align more quickly, as well as develop a shared language around complex ideas.</p><h3>3. Adoption is prevalent, but lacks strategy</h3><p>Marie isn’t unique. Only 2 of 28 survey respondents said they don’t use AI at all. But adoption is happening in an exploratory phase mostly without global strategy:</p><ul><li>Some designers <strong>feel pressured to use tools</strong> that clash with their values</li></ul><blockquote>“I’d say it’s more pressure. I’ve been a bit resistant to AI because I don’t find that the efficiency outweighs the environmental cost at the end of the day. But I’m slowly changing my mind and I’m trying to use it for very specific things.” <br /><em>— 7th participant to user interviews (Product Designer)</em></blockquote><ul><li>Others received <strong>conflicting instructions on how to use AI</strong>, with designers being banned from using it and developers being encouraged to use it, and vice versa</li><li>Others describe frequent discussions about AI and tools, but <strong>no capitalisation on what was learnt</strong> through individual experimentation</li></ul><p>Companies are aware this is a key issue but <strong>implement solutions piecemeal. </strong>The result is fragmented practices, missed learning opportunities, and unequal access across teams.</p><h3>A different perspective on change</h3><p>What struck me most during this research is that <strong>AI isn’t fundamentally changing collaboration: it makes existing collaborative fundamentals even more crucial.</strong></p><p>Good collaborators can leverage AI more effectively. Teams with poor communication don’t magically improve just because they can prototype faster. Establishing frameworks that make designer-developer partnerships work becomes more important, not obsolete. The framework designed by Alicia Calderón González (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0BJAf0b3OY&amp;t=167s"">communication, collaboration, alignment</a>), Lead Design Strategist at Miyagami, which I discovered later in my research, seems even more relevant today.</p><figure><img alt=""An illustration describing the three main steps in Alicia Calderòns’ collaboration framework: communication, collaboration, alignment"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wjvC7HN0A86u21zO06n9fA.png"" /><figcaption>The ‘Unlocking Collaboration’ framework created by Alicia Calderón González is even more relevant today.

You’ll find under some examples. The key insight: we need to evolve from individual AI adoption to team-wide transformation.</p><p><strong>Governance:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Audit existing employee practices</strong>: Individual practices have already evolved to include AI, but in silos. Understanding current usage patterns helps identify where AI has already penetrated processes.</li></ul><p><strong>Process:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Create an AI usage charter</strong>: A shared framework helps align practices between designers, developers, and across the entire company.</li><li><strong>Establish guided experimentation</strong>: Create sandbox environments for testing AI in collaboration without impacting critical deliverables. Tools that bridge both professions offer particularly interesting opportunities for joint designer-developer experiments.</li></ul><p><strong>Operational Support:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Invest in shared training</strong>: Provide designers and developers with common foundations in prompting, technical basics, and chosen tools to create shared language and collective skill development.</li><li><strong>Enable effective documentation</strong>: Document what works and what doesn’t to define and evolve AI workflows based on experimental results.</li></ul><p>Bear in mind that AI is still in the exploratory stage and prone to instability. My goal here is not to offer an absolute framework of how things should be, but rather to provide actionable recommendations that will help to move beyond individual or silo adoption. The aim is to use AI to facilitate collaboration.</p><figure><img alt=""An illustration of collaboration with AI, with a robot head on top connected to a woman and two men by lines"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/999/1*oVACV_9xaKCe4kuePkgMjQ.png"" /><figcaption>My recommendations aim to encourage the adoption of AI across different departments and establish shared practices between designers like Marie, developers like Tony, and product managers like John. Credit: Anna Lefour.</figcaption></figure><h3>Looking forward</h3><p>This research had its limitations (small survey sample, context-specific tests, timing constraints), but comparing my findings with larger studies like <a href=""https://www.figma.com/fr-fr/reports/designer-developer-trends/"">Figma’s State of the Designer 2025</a> revealed consistent patterns across different contexts.</p><p>What I’ve observed is that teams are currently in an exploratory phase with AI, often lacking strategic coordination. <strong>The teams that will benefit most aren’t necessarily those who adopt AI fastest, but those who think most carefully about how it fits into their collaborative practices</strong>.</p><p>AI won’t replace design or development roles, but it is creating new opportunities for teams willing to experiment thoughtfully with how they work together.</p><p><strong>What’s your experience with AI in product teams? Have you seen it improve or complicate collaboration?</strong></p><p><em>Many thanks to all who contributed their time and insights to this research.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11935997.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Since the NFL broke the news on Sunday night that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-dtmf-colonialism-puerto-rico"">Bad Bunny</a> will be the 2026 Apple Music <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/28/arts/music/bad-bunny-super-bowl-halftime.html"">Super Bowl halftime show performer</a>, the MAGA-verse has been inflamed — and that’s kind of the point.</p>



<p>When Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, takes the stage on February 8 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, he’ll be crashing the biggest old boys’ club in America as everything the ultra-conservative loves to hate: a Latine who refuses to perform in English, critiques the Trump administration, defies gender roles, advocates for immigrant and queer communities, and calls for the decolonization of Puerto Rico — and he does it all with global reach, power, and support.</p>



<p>While the Latin trap and reggaeton artist-actor recently told Apple Music that he is still “figuring out” what he’s going to do during his performance, the political right have already begun lashing out at the artist.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“While the Latin trap and reggaeton artist-actor recently told Apple Music that he is still ‘figuring out’ what he’s going to do during his performance, the political right have already begun lashing out at the artist.”</p><cite>Raquel reichard</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Conservative podcaster Benny Johnson called Bad Bunny a “<a href=""https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/music/articles/maga-meltdown-over-super-bowl-131445573.html"">massive Trump hater</a>” and “anti-ICE.” Newsmax host Greg Kelly claimed the artist “<a href=""https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/music/articles/newsmax-host-loses-bad-bunny-035618728.html"">hates America</a>” and “hates the English language.” And Ryan Fournier, chair of Students for Trump, suggested that executives at Roc Nation — the entertainment agency founded by Jay-Z, which has partnered with the NFL on halftime show production since 2019 — “<a href=""https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/09/30/bad-bunny-latin-pride-trump/"">should be fired</a>.” </p>



<p>But the vitriolic attacks and reemerging calls to <a href=""https://sports.yahoo.com/article/theres-growing-push-boycott-super-130542029.html"">boycott the Super Bowl</a> come as no surprise. Since Roc Nation began collaborating with the league — part of the NFL’s broader effort to repair its image and address longstanding racial and social justice concerns following the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/09/173847/take-a-kneel-protests-2017"">Colin Kaepernick protests</a> against police violence — every non-white artist who has taken the coveted halftime spot has faced backlash from conservative critics accusing the NFL of pushing a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/02/11253627/woke-meaning-co-opted-politics"">“woke” agenda</a> or prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) over talent. Nevermind that to qualify for the biggest stage in the world, artists must be among the biggest in the world — and whether critics like it or not, performers like Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/02/11666227/usher-super-bowl-halftime-show"">Usher</a>, Rihanna,<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2020/02/9388654/jennifer-lopez-hidden-messages-super-bowl-performance""> Jennifer Lopez</a>, Shakira, and now Bad Bunny are chart-toppers and global icons.</p>







<p>Unlike Jason Aldean — whom Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton suggested as a more <a href=""https://www.audacy.com/kmox/news/national/paxton-criticizes-nfl-choice-of-bad-bunny"">“patriotic” choice</a> — these artists dominate streaming platforms, regularly top Billboard charts, and have massive international followings. Bad Bunny, for instance, was Spotify’s most-streamed artist globally in 2020, 2021, and 2022, surpassing both Taylor Swift and Drake. On the Billboard 200, he has achieved multiple No. 1 albums, including <em>El Último Tour del Mundo</em> (2020), <em>Un Verano Sin Ti </em>(2022), <em>Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana </em>(2023), and <em>Debí Tirar Más Fotos</em> (2025). The finale of his recent <em>No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí </em>residency in Puerto Rico, itself a historic moment for him and his island, was streamed globally on Amazon Music, Prime Video, and Twitch, and it became the <a href=""https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-latin/bad-bunny-breaks-record-most-watched-amazon-music-stream-1235432020/"">most-watched single-artist livestream</a> in Amazon Music’s history.</p>



<p>If Bad Bunny does use his Super Bowl performance as a political platform, he won’t be the first. Many of Bad Bunny’s predecessors have used the roughly 12- to 15-minute halftime show — which is watched by more than 100 million viewers worldwide — as an opportunity to speak out against injustice. In 2016, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/10/177881/justin-timberlake-janet-beyonce-super-bowl-halftime-performers"">Beyoncé</a> incorporated powerful imagery highlighting Black Lives Matter and police brutality. In 2020, Jennifer Lopez wore a Puerto Rican flag cape and spotlighted <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/super-bowl-halftime-kids-in-cages/"">children in cages to protest immigration policies</a>. That same year, Shakira infused her performance with Middle Eastern-inspired tongue-trilling, paying homage to her Lebanese heritage. In 2025, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/02/11852764/kendrick-lamar-super-bowl-halftime-show-reaction-meaning"">Kendrick Lamar </a>and his collaborators delivered a politically charged show addressing systemic racism and social inequity, with Lamar famously proclaiming, “the revolution will be televised,” all while President Donald Trump sat in the audience.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“If Bad Bunny does use his Super Bowl performance as a political platform, he won’t be the first.”</p><cite>Raquel reichard</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>And yet Bad Bunny is arguably the most overtly political artist booked for the halftime spot. Martínez Ocasio has consistently used his music to speak out on a range of political and social issues, particularly those affecting Puerto Rico and other marginalized communities. His 2018 hit “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcHTl9h7TWI"">Estamos Bien</a>” became an anthem of resilience in the wake of Hurricane María, subtly addressing the U.S. government’s neglect of Puerto Rico during the crisis. In 2019, he released “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSh7HIH2pvg"">Afilando los Cuchillos</a>” alongside Residente and iLe, a diss track aimed at then-Governor of Puerto Rico <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/07/238239/puerto-rico-ricardo-rossello-chat-protest"">Ricardo Rosselló</a> after the leak of offensive Telegram chats. The song quickly became the unofficial soundtrack of the mass protests that ousted Rosselló, and Bad Bunny even paused his European tour to join demonstrators in the streets of Viejo San Juan. In 2020, amid the George Floyd protests and the global rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, he released “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8GT33tkQGU"">Compositor del Año</a>,” a spoken-word piece that condemned anti-Black police violence and U.S. racial hypocrisy, stating: “A Black man with a gun is a criminal, but if he’s white, it’s a hobby.”</p>







<p>His 2022 blockbuster album<em> </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/05/10974305/bad-bunny-un-verano-sin-ti-album""><em>Un Verano Sin Ti </em></a>deepened his political commentary. The track “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdQEljUMCEM&amp;list=RDQdQEljUMCEM&amp;start_radio=1"">El Apagón</a>” criticized power outages, displacement, and gentrification on the archipelago, specifically calling out the privatization of Puerto Rico’s electrical grid and the influx of wealthy foreign investors. On the same album, “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjvTQTGogUM&amp;list=RDgjvTQTGogUM&amp;start_radio=1"">Andrea</a> (Feat. Buscabulla)” told the story of a young woman navigating systemic gender violence in Puerto Rico, widely seen as a tribute to <a href=""https://periodismoinvestigativo.com/2022/07/puerto-ricos-supreme-court-chief-justice-is-held-accountable-for-court-response-to-gender-violence-cases/"">Andrea Ruiz Costas</a>, a femicide victim failed by the justice system. And his latest project, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-dtmf-colonialism-puerto-rico""><em>DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS</em></a><em>, </em>was in many ways a call for a decolonized Puerto Rico. Songs like “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvfDaZ4ZT80&amp;list=RDuvfDaZ4ZT80&amp;start_radio=1"">Lo Que le Pasó a Hawái</a>” warned Puerto Ricans of cultural erasure and economic displacement, drawing parallels between the island and tourist-saturated Hawai‘i. The album also incorporated ancestral Afro-Puerto Rican rhythms and jíbaro sounds, grounding its critique in the cultural and musical roots of the island’s working class.</p>



<p>Unlike Latine stars before him, Bad Bunny has made it a point not to make music in English. But it’s not because he hates the language; it’s because it’s not his language. He’s said that just as he grew up consuming English-language pop without fully understanding it, English-speaking audiences can do the same with Spanish. “I am never going to [sing in English] just because someone says I need to do it to reach a certain audience,” he told <a href=""https://people.com/bad-bunny-only-speaks-english-for-specific-people-talks-2023-grammys-7968562?utm_source=chatgpt.com""><em>People</em></a> in 2023. “It’s just that I feel more comfortable in my own language. I think in Spanish, I feel in Spanish, I eat in Spanish, I sing in Spanish.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“And yet Bad Bunny is arguably the most overtly political artist booked for the halftime spot.”</p><cite>raquel reichard</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>And he’s not alone. Despite Trump’s executive order making <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/designating-english-as-the-official-language-of-the-united-states/"">English the official language</a> of the U.S., more than 43 million people in the country<a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/183483/ranking-of-languages-spoken-at-home-in-the-us-in-2008/""> speak Spanish at home</a>. It is the second-most spoken language in the U.S., and the U.S. is the <a href=""https://wearemitu.com/wearemitu/culture/the-us-worlds-second-spanish-speaking-nation/"">second-largest Spanish-speaking country in the world</a>, after Mexico. “This halftime show is a confirmation that Spanish is not just a ‘foreign’ language here, but rather a real-life example of how Spanish is woven into the fabric of American life,” Esteban Touma, a Spanish teacher, linguist, and cultural expert at Babbel, told Refinery29 Somos. “Bad Bunny’s art showcases that Spanish speaking has a place in the U.S. cultural zeitgeist. In fact, this halftime show pushes back on the idea that speaking Spanish is un-American. Let’s not forget that Puerto Rico is part of the U.S.”</p>



<p>And as a colony of the U.S. for 127 years, Puerto Rico’s Spanish dialect has been shaped by its complex history, migration patterns, and the creativity of its speakers. This Caribbean Spanish is sometimes viewed by other Latin American communities as “sloppy” or “ghetto.” And yet, it is precisely this vibrant dialect that Bad Bunny will proudly showcase to a global audience. According to Touma, “it showcases the possibility of a multi-cultural community.” </p>



<p>“Bad Bunny will be on the world’s biggest stage, proudly speaking Spanish in his native dialect, flipping any stigma on its head,” Touma said. “For Spanish speakers and Puerto Ricans specifically, my hope is that this performance is deeply validating.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Unlike Latine stars before him, Bad Bunny has made it a point not to make music in English. But it’s not because he hates the language; it’s because it’s not his language.”</p><cite>raquel reichard</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>And it already has been. Even for Latines who aren’t necessarily Bad Bunny or reggaeton fans, the artist commands respect. Even more so after he<a href=""https://i-d.co/article/bad-bunny-puerto-rico-residency-issue-375-cover/""> told i-D Magazine</a> in September that he left the U.S. off his recent tour dates due to concerns about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids at concert venues. “It’s something that we were talking about and very concerned about,” he said in the interview. While some critics pointed out the apparent contradiction between skipping a U.S. tour and performing at the Super Bowl, the two situations aren’t the same. A one-night, tightly controlled event like the Super Bowl carries far fewer risks than a multi-city tour, where ICE activity can vary widely by location. And unlike the crowds at his concerts, the Super Bowl audience is mostly corporate guests and NFL insiders — not the fans he was concerned about protecting.</p>







<p>Bad Bunny has publicly taken aim at Trump’s policies, rhetoric, and camp before, first following his inaction in Puerto Rico after Hurricane María and, more recently, in 2024, after Trump-supporting comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” at a rally. After saying the joke “wasn’t funny,” he endorsed Kamala Harris for president — a rare move meant to mobilize his U.S.-based fanbase, since as a Puerto Rican resident, he himself cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections. </p>



<p>While Bad Bunny hasn’t said how — or even if — he’ll use his Super Bowl halftime show to send a political message, it already is political. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“In February 2026, he’ll carry that flag, that history, and that ancestral rebellion to the 50-yard line.”</p><cite>RAQUEL REICHARD</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>His refusal to tour the U.S. — walking away from the millions he would’ve earned from what would undoubtedly have been another sold-out stadium run — was an act of protest. And so is accepting the halftime stage, where he won’t be paid, in order to bring reggaeton — a genre born from protest and Afro-Caribbean resistance — and his decolonial Puerto Rican message to the most-watched stage in the U.S. and the heart of its colonizer. A stage where, at this moment, he may have more enemies than fans in the crowd. </p>



<p>There is one thing we do know about his vision for the show, though. Bad Bunny said it’s “for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown… this is for my people, my culture, and our history.” </p>



<p>And it’s exactly that decentering of white America during white America’s favorite pastime that has so many on the right up in arms. </p>



<p>But as Bad Bunny raps in “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYAONSDnMrc&amp;list=RDqYAONSDnMrc&amp;start_radio=1"">LA MuDANZA</a>,” “Aquí mataron gente por sacar la bandera. Por eso es que ahora yo la llevo donde quiera. (“Here, they killed people for raising the flag. That’s why now I carry it everywhere),” and in February 2026, he’ll carry that flag, that history, and that ancestral rebellion to the 50-yard line.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11929972.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Welcome to the final three-month stretch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/yearly-horoscope-2025"">of 2025</a>. October begins with a profound shift in energy as Mercury joins Mars in Scorpio on October 6, sharpening our minds and intensifying our communication. This is an invitation to think more precisely, act more intentionally, and listen to the instincts you may have previously silenced. But with this intensity also comes the potential for shadow behavior — obsession, control, envy, and manipulation may surface both personally and collectively. Don’t run from them. Scorpio energy teaches us to transform, not avoid. The invitation is to alchemize our shadows into strength. </p>



<p>The Full Moon in Aries also rises on October 6, one of the most powerful moments of the month. It marks the official end of eclipse season, a time of revelation, upheaval, and re-alignment. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/03/10388783/fire-signs-zodiac-meaning-aries-leo-sagittarius"">Aries fire</a> burns away the residue of fear and doubt that may have lingered after the Virgo solar eclipse. It’s a bold moon. A “mind your business, hydrate, and own your path” moon. This lunation asks you to let go of comparison and overthinking. How can you trust your instincts more than your anxieties? How can you lead instead of waiting for permission? The medicine is in movement… even a small step counts. </p>



<p>October is one of the calmest months astrologically in 2025, at least on a personal transit level. That doesn’t mean the world outside is still — far from it. Pluto is still dismantling illusions in Aquarius and Saturn is revisiting karmic contracts in Pisces. But amidst the collective chaos, there’s a rare window for personal clarity, rest, and integration. Venus enters Libra, her home sign, on October 13, softening interpersonal tension and bringing a wave of aesthetic, romantic, and emotional harmony. We’re learning <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/sex-love-horoscope-2025"">how to offer love</a> that doesn’t smother. Love that breathes. Love that respects the balance between intimacy and independence. </p>



<p>That same day, Pluto stations direct in Aquarius, adding depth and dimension to the shifts already in motion. Pluto in Aquarius is about long-term revolution. This is the age of dismantling systemic illusions — but it’s a marathon, not a sprint. With Pluto in Aquarius until 2044, we’re each playing a small yet significant role in building a freer world. As the month unfolds, you may ask: what’s your piece of the puzzle? What world are you co-creating through your words, values, and relationships? </p>



<p>The Libra New Moon on October 21 is a deeply loving reset. It invites you to realign your life with justice, balance, and beauty. You’ll feel this especially if you’ve been over giving, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/people-pleasing-sex-life-satisfy-partner"">people-pleasing</a>, or swinging between extremes. The cosmos wants you to come home to equilibrium. Then on October 22, Neptune retrograde re-enters Pisces, joining Saturn in one final wave of spiritual reckoning. The veil is thinning. Dreams may feel more vivid. Feelings may get more intense. But with Scorpio Season beginning October 23, you’ll have the power to go deeper without drowning. The water will rise, but so will your truth. Let this month soften you, not shatter you. Let it initiate your next era. <br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, October’s intensifying Scorpio energy puts you face-to-face with the more taboo, intimate, and hidden parts of life, especially in your sector of mergers, shared resources, and transformation. Mars and Mercury are both in Scorpio for most of the month, and starting October 23, the Sun joins them. This cosmic trio stirs up your inner detective — you’re not just skimming the surface anymore; you’re diving into soul contracts, psychic hunches, and money matters that connect you to others. Themes around death and rebirth (symbolic or literal) could come up, whether it’s the death of a version of you, or a financial obligation reaching its breaking point. Don’t be afraid to ask yourself: <em>What do I need to release control over to allow more flow in? </em></p>



<p>Pluto, planet of transformation, ends its retrograde and shifts direct in Aquarius on October 13, activating your sector of community, activism, and innovation. Over the past five months, you may have felt isolated or less inspired when it came to collaborating with others. But now the tide is turning. You may be invited to take on a leadership role within a collective or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/making-friends-connections-adulthood"">friendship circle</a> — one that requires radical honesty and sustained commitment. This is your cue to start planting seeds for the future world you want to build, both personally and politically. </p>



<p>The month also has more light and ease thanks to Venus entering Libra on October 13 and the Libra New Moon on October 21, both activating your sector of partnership, romance, and compromise. After the full moon in your sign on the 6th (which probably felt like an emotional exhale), you’re craving connection in more refined and graceful ways. This is a powerful time to either renew an existing relationship or open yourself up to a new one — especially one that’s balanced, beautiful, and real. <em>What does it mean to choose love from a place of peace, not chaos? </em></p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, October’s Scorpio stellium is activating your sector of partnership, commitment, and one-on-one relationships, and the intensity is real. With Mars and Mercury both in Scorpio this month and the Sun joining them on October 23, you’re being asked to get serious about who’s in your inner circle. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/passive-aggressive-psychology-work"">Passive-aggressive</a> communication or lingering resentments won’t fly anymore — this is the month to speak truth with love. Whether in business or love, you’re being pushed to ask: <em>Is this union bringing out the best in me? Or is it time to renegotiate the terms of our connection? </em>The power dynamics in your closest bonds are up for revision. </p>



<p>Pluto shifting direct in Aquarius on October 13 reactivates your sector of career, legacy, and public recognition. You’ve been in deep reconsideration mode regarding what you want to be known for, but now the fog starts lifting. Expect slow but steady momentum in work projects, brand visibility, and long-term ambitions. Don’t underestimate the power of subtle shifts — how you present yourself, what you commit to, and how much you’re willing to evolve will all set the tone for this next five-month chapter of professional growth. </p>



<p>Later in the month, your ruler Venus enters Libra on October 13 and the New Moon in Libra follows on October 21, both gracing your sector of wellness, routines, and organization. These transits offer a breath of balance and clarity after the emotional highs of early October’s Aries Full Moon on the 6th. This is a great time to beautify your workspace, revamp your daily rituals, or find harmony between productivity and rest. Small tweaks to your schedule could lead to major breakthroughs. <em>What would it feel like to work with grace instead of pressure? </em></p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831461.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, this October you’re being pulled into a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/dr-giles-yeo-gene-eating"">deep detox mode</a> as Scorpio energy floods your sector of wellness, mental and physical health, and daily rhythm. With Mercury joining Mars in Scorpio on the 6th and the Sun making its entrance on October 23, you’re being invited to zoom in on the micro-level of your life: how you’re eating, sleeping, moving, and thinking. It’s not about perfecting your routine but noticing which habits support your vitality and which drain it. Watch out for obsessive thoughts or burnout tendencies… Scorpio transits can push you to overdo, but your body will thank you for slowing down. </p>



<p>The softer energy of Venus entering Libra on October 13 and the New Moon in Libra on October 21 lands in your sector of creativity, dating, and joy, encouraging you to lighten the load and lead with play. After the cathartic Aries Full Moon on October 6 (activating your community and friendship zone), you may feel more open to reconnecting with your social or romantic life. It’s a great time to take a break from overthinking and simply enjoy beauty, pleasure, and connection. <em>What would it look like to prioritize your joy, just because? </em></p>



<p>Pluto shifting direct in Aquarius on October 13 breathes life back into your sector of expansion, travel, and higher learning. Over the past few months, you may have questioned your worldview or felt stalled in your quest for growth. Now you’re entering a chapter where bold new ideas — especially unconventional or spiritual ones — begin to take root. You may also be drawn to international connections, publishing, or advanced studies. This is your call to reawaken your curiosity and let your beliefs evolve with you. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831462.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, October invites you to embrace passion and depth as Scorpio transits supercharge your sector of romance, pleasure, play, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9938910/marc-jacobs-interview-perfect-fragrance"">self-expression</a>. Mars is in Scorpio and Mercury will join on the 6th, and starting October 23, the Sun joins the mix. You may feel a surge of inspiration to create, to flirt, to seduce — or to destroy something that no longer excites your heart. Scorpio energy isn’t afraid to feel deeply, and neither are you. But this month, the cosmos wants to see you <em>channel </em>those feelings — into a love poem, a new creative project, or a long-overdue conversation about what truly turns you on. </p>



<p>Pluto shifting direct in Aquarius on October 13 empowers your sector of intimacy, emotional healing, and shared resources. You’ve been navigating slow, subterranean shifts in how you merge your energy with others, and now you’re ready to move forward. This could bring breakthroughs in financial negotiations, joint ventures, or therapy breakthroughs. You’re learning that vulnerability isn’t a weakness — it’s a superpower, and it’s how the deepest transformations occur. </p>



<p>By mid-month, a softer wave arrives as Venus enters Libra on October 13 and the New Moon in Libra on October 21 blesses your sector of home, emotional foundations, and ancestral roots. This energy could bring peace and healing to your living space or family dynamics. The Aries Full Moon on October 6 may have stirred some tension around career vs. home life, but Libra’s influence encourages you to find balance. Maybe that means redecorating your home, tending to an elder, or creating new rituals that ground you. <em>What makes you feel truly safe, and how can you give yourself more of that now? </em></p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831463.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, your roots are calling. With Mercury entering Scorpio on the 6th, joining Mars, and the Sun following on the 23rd, October spotlights your sector of home, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/ancestry-dna-test-black-history"">ancestry, family</a>, and emotional foundations. You’re being asked to go within, perhaps literally, by spending more time in your sanctuary, or spiritually, by reflecting on where you come from and where you’re headed. These transits may stir up old memories, family dynamics, or a desire to redefine your concept of safety. What makes you feel held? What patterns are ready to be broken so new ones can blossom? </p>



<p>The Aries Full Moon on the 6th energizes your expansion zone and ignites your sector of travel, publishing, spirituality, and belief systems. You might feel a rush of inspiration, like you’re ready to leap into the unknown. What truth are you aching to tell, what place are you longing to visit? Venus enters Libra on the 13th and the Libra New Moon follows on the 21st, bringing harmony and fresh connections to your communication sector. This is the time to send the email, write the song, or have that overdue heart-to-heart. Words are your superpower in the second half of the month — let them shine. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Pluto, planet of transformation, stations direct in your partnership sector on October 13, after months of slow, subterranean shifts. You may gain clarity around a relationship that’s felt stuck, whether it’s a business contract, creative collaboration, or romantic entanglement. This isn’t light stuff… Pluto asks for soul truth. If a dynamic has become toxic, you’ll feel it more intensely now. But if it’s meant to deepen, you’ll find yourself navigating the necessary growth to sustain it. </p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831464.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, your mind is buzzing with revelations this October. With Mars and Mercury (your planetary ruler) both in Scorpio, and the Sun joining them on the 23rd, your sector of communication, learning, local travel, and curiosity is on fire. You may find yourself <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/01/11636388/daily-journaling-mental-health-benefits"">journaling more</a>, reconnecting with siblings or childhood friends, or developing a skill that’s long intrigued you. This is your cosmic permission slip to follow your intellectual obsessions, even if they seem random at first. The more you explore, the more synchronicity you’ll find. </p>



<p>The Aries Full Moon on October 6 highlights your intimacy sector, revealing where power is being shared — or not. Emotions may run high around finances, trust, or sexual vulnerability. Let truth, not fear, guide your release. Venus entering Libra on the 13th and the Libra New Moon on the 21st bring blessings to your money zone. This is your moment to manifest new sources of income, reimagine your relationship to value, and magnetize abundance by remembering what you’re worth. </p>



<p>When Pluto stations direct in Aquarius on October 13, your sector of health, habits, work-life balance, and purpose begins to churn with forward momentum. Something that’s been stagnant in your daily rhythm may crack open. You could experience a shift in how you work or serve others, especially if burnout or over-responsibility has crept in. Pluto’s been whispering to you about long-term transformation; now that whisper may become a roar. </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831465.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, the month of October wants to empower your worth. It’s your birthday season until the 23rd, so you’re feeling yourself and everyone around you is too. Mars is already in Scorpio, Mercury joins it on the 6th, and the Sun follows on the 23rd, meaning your sector of money, value, self-esteem, and resources is lit up for most of the month. The Scorpio emphasis will make you extra aware of any energetic leaks — people, projects, or beliefs that drain rather than enrich you. This is a powerful time to revisit your relationship to earning, saving, and investing, especially if you’re ready to shift from scarcity into sustainability. <br /><br />The Aries Full Moon on October 6 lights up your relationship sector, bringing clarity to a partnership dynamic. Whether it’s a green light to go deeper or a cosmic nudge to walk away, trust your gut. Venus, your planetary ruler, enters your sign on the 13th, and the Libra New Moon on the 21st is your annual reset. Think of this as a rebirth of self-love, magnetism, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/boost-confidence-tips"">and confidence</a>. You’re blooming… and you’re allowed to be seen. <br /><br />Another highlight of the month is Pluto’s shift direct in Aquarius on October 13, which supercharges your joy sector, stimulating feelings of romance, creativity, play, and pleasure. A passion you once shelved may return with new life, or you may feel emboldened to pursue a relationship, hobby, or project that feels deeply soul-fed. Pluto’s been teaching you to follow your bliss unapologetically. You’re not here to live small, and this month you’re finally ready to prove it. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831467.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, this month is <em>your </em>solar season, and it begins with a bang. Mars, your co-ruler, has already been in your sign, energizing your sector of self, since September 22. Mercury joins on October 6, making your words more potent and intuitive than usual. And then the Sun enters your sign on October 23, kicking off your birthday season with deep rebirth energy. People are noticing your glow, and more than that, they’re feeling your power. This is a cosmic green light to take up space, honor your boundaries, and reclaim parts of yourself that you once disowned. <br /><br />The Aries Full Moon on October 6 highlights your wellness sector. It’s a wake-up call around your energy levels, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2022/08/11094946/cooking-mental-health-benefits-anxiety-ocd"">daily rituals</a>, and the way you care for your body. Something’s gotta give… but you already know what it is. Venus entering Libra on October 13 and the Libra New Moon on the 21st activate your sector of endings, dreams, and solitude. You may feel more introspective, even withdrawn. But don’t mistake quiet for weakness. You’re in a cocoon, and your wings are forming. <br /><br />Pluto, your modern ruler, stations direct in Aquarius on October 13, shifting your home and emotional foundation sector. This is the start of a profound new chapter in how you feel held, safe, and rooted — internally and externally. You might revisit childhood wounds or feel the urge to move, redecorate, or change the dynamics in your household. Whatever comes up, know it’s in service of building the kind of sanctuary that supports your evolution. </p>



<p>And then, Scorpio, on October 23rd your solar return season <em>begins</em>! With Mercury and Mars in your sign alongside the Sun, you’re not just the center of attention… you <em>are </em>the symbol of rebirth and transformation. This is a rare trifecta that puts your voice, your willpower, and your aura on high. What do you want to be known for this new solar year? What version of you is rising from the ashes? Whether you’re turning 18 or 80, you’re being reborn — and you have the mic. Use the spotlight with intention. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831468.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, this month’s cosmic momentum starts with a bang. The Aries Full Moon on October 6 lights up your sector of fate, pleasure, and true love. Your heart may feel full to-bursting with emotion, whether from joy, grief, nostalgia, or surprise. Someone from the past could reappear, or you may have a breakthrough around a passion project, creative calling, or romantic dynamic. Venus entering Libra on the 13th and the Libra New Moon on the 21st activate your sector of friendships, community, and technology. New collaborations and invitations may arise, particularly through digital spaces or creative collectives. Don’t underestimate the power of the DMs or a random <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/whatsapp-adds-reactions"">group chat</a> — love and opportunity are flowing through networks. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Pluto in Aquarius stations direct in your communication sector on October 13 after months of internal rewiring. If you’ve felt blocked, misunderstood, or overly cautious with your voice, this transit could unlock the dam. But Pluto doesn’t deal in fluff. This is truth serum energy — the kind that makes you write the real poem, send the difficult message, or admit what’s been brewing under the surface. Your voice is evolving, and so are your connections. </p>



<p>All month long, a powerful Scorpio stellium is stirring behind the scenes in your chart. With Mars and Mercury moving through your spiritual sector, and the Sun joining them on the 23rd, you’re entering a period of retreat, reflection, and deep psychic clearing. This is the preparation before your rebirth. Let solitude become your sanctuary. Vivid dreams, ancestral downloads, and intuitive nudges are part of the path now. Don’t rush clarity — let it come like thunder after stillness. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831469.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the month of October begins with a blast of emotional intensity. The Aries Full Moon on October 6 brings matters of home, family, and inner security to the forefront. Whether you’re processing <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/07/10548053/childhood-memories-kitchen-plate-patterns-casserole-dish"">old childhood memories</a> or physically rearranging your living space, the energy is calling you back to your roots. Venus entering Libra on October 13 and the New Moon in Libra on the 21st highlight your career and reputation sector, offering a new beginning. You may receive public recognition, a job offer, or simply clarity on your path. Let your diplomacy, vision, and grace lead the way — especially in tense situations. </p>



<p>Pluto, the planet of transformation, stations direct in your money sector on October 13. Financial decisions you’ve been sitting on may suddenly feel more clear. This could involve shared assets, long-term investments, or completely reimagining what security means to you. Deep-rooted fears around scarcity may rise mid-month, but so will your ability to transform them. Your relationship with money is evolving into something more empowered and spiritually aligned. </p>



<p>The Scorpio stellium this month — Mercury entering on the 6th, Mars continuing its journey, and the Sun joining on the 23rd — spotlights your friendship and social network sector. You’re craving depth and authenticity in your connections. Some people may fall away, others may surprise you with their loyalty. You might also feel called to align your activism or community involvement with your personal values in a more intentional way. Lead with integrity and magnetize your soul fam. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831471.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The Aries Full Moon on October 6 activates your communication sector, Aquarius. Expect information to move fast — texts, emails, intuitive downloads, or even sudden conversations that shift everything. This is a powerful lunation to express yourself, pitch ideas, or revisit a conversation that’s been on your heart. Venus entering Libra on October 13 and the New Moon in Libra on October 21 bless your travel and expansion sector. You might feel drawn to book a trip, return to school, or explore new spiritual or philosophical frameworks. The universe wants you to widen your worldview — follow the breadcrumbs. </p>



<p>On October 13, Pluto in Aquarius stations direct in your sign after a four-month retrograde. This is monumental. After months of internal excavation, you’re emerging with sharper clarity on who you’re becoming. Pluto’s transit through Aquarius is a 20-year <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/sweaty-betty-inspiring-women-advice"">transformation of your identity</a>, and this station is like a power boost. You may feel more emotionally intense, intuitive, or even impatient with surface-level versions of yourself. Trust that the real you is unfolding in divine time. </p>



<p>Throughout the month, a Scorpio stellium (Mars, Mercury entering Scorpio on the 6th, and the Sun on the 23rd) intensifies your career and legacy sector. You’re being watched, and not in a creepy way. You’re being seen as a force of influence, someone with the courage to challenge outdated systems and offer new blueprints. Take your time crafting your message. This month’s Scorpio energy demands strategy, precision, and purpose. Your next big move is being built in the shadows before it rises to the stage. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831472.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, the Aries Full Moon on October 6 highlights your financial axis, particularly your relationship to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/loud-budgeting-money-boundaries"">personal income, budgeting</a>, and material value. This month you may feel like a wave of clarity is pushing you to release old money patterns or speak more honestly about your worth. Venus enters Libra on the 13th and the New Moon follows on the 21st, lighting up your sector of intimacy, merging, and emotional contracts. These transits invite you to examine who you trust with your heart — and who you trust with your energy, finances, and secrets. </p>



<p>Pluto in Aquarius stations direct in your sector of healing, closure, and the subconscious mind on October 13. This is a deep underworld portal being reopened. Emotions you thought were “dealt with” might bubble back up — not to punish you, but to be fully transmuted. This is a powerful time to return to therapy, meditation, dreamwork, or spiritual studies. Pay attention to what your dreams or body are trying to say. Pluto will guide you into wholeness through surrender. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Scorpio stellium this month is all about elevation. Mars and Mercury (starting October 6) plus the Sun (starting the 23rd) activate your sector of expansion, truth-telling, and long-term vision. This is one of the most aligned times of year to share your voice, book that spiritual retreat, or write the proposal that’s been sitting in your drafts. You’re not just imagining new horizons, you’re ready to leap toward them.</p>

<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>What are Amazon Prime Big Deal Days?</h2>



<p>Prime Day started out as a one-day sale in 2015 to mark Amazon’s 20th anniversary, and has now become a full 48-hour shopping event that takes place twice a year. It’s fully become its own shopping holiday, rivaling Black Friday. Prime Day (and its <strong><a href=""https://amzn.to/3KkD9zd"">Big Deal Days</a></strong> sister holiday) itself has evolved over the past decade, but what you can always expect are daily and hourly deals on a massive selection of the site’s best-selling items, both from in-house brands as well as familiar names in fashion, beauty, and more. </p>



<h2>When is Prime Big Deal Days this year?</h2>



<p><a href=""https://amzn.to/3KkD9zd"">Prime Big Deal Days 2025</a> will take place on <strong>October 7 and 8</strong>. Watch this space to discover which products you need to snag ASAP and how you can access the sale.</p>



<h2>What is on sale for Prime Big Deal Days?</h2>



<p>As with previous Prime Days, products across beauty, fashion, home, tech, and more will be on sale this week as part of the event. While you wait for the deals to begin, you can shop early discounts on everyday essentials, home tech, and more. </p>



<h2>How do I get access to Prime Big Deal Days?</h2>



<p>There’s no way around it: You have to be an Amazon Prime member to access these discounts. Set deal alerts based on your shopping and search history for personalized recommendations through the Amazon app. (Alexa can also help you in this department.)</p>



<h2>Is Prime Big Deal Days worth it?</h2>



<p>As mentioned above, if you’re unsure about the benefits of joining Amazon Prime but don’t want to miss out on Prime Day, you can sign up for a free (!) 30-day trial. (This is kind of the perfect time to work the system, but, if you love the benefits, you can keep your membership after the trial period for $14.99 a month.) In addition to the marquee benefits of free lightning-fast shipping and hours of entertainment via Prime Video, there are lesser-known conveniences, like discounts from Amazon Pharmacy, early access to blink-and-you’ll-miss-them Lightning Deals, and ad-free music and podcasts with Amazon Music.</p>



<h2>Does Amazon ever offer discounts on Prime memberships?</h2>



<p>If you decide you like the Prime lifestyle and want to keep your access to everything Amazon has to offer, there are two ways to get an ongoing discount on your Prime membership. <a href=""https://amzn.to/448ycOr"">College students are eligible for a six-month free trial</a> followed by a $7.49 monthly fee for Prime, which is 50% off the regular monthly price. In addition, if you<a href=""https://amzn.to/3NHNPHp""> receive government benefits</a> in the form of SNAP, WIC, or other EBT programs, you can get Prime perks for a discounted $6.99 per month.</p>



<h2>What deals will Amazon’s competitors have during Prime Big Deal Days?</h2>



<p>Amazon has done such a thorough job of creating a frenzy around Prime Day that almost every other big-box retailer under the sun (Best Buy, Target, Walmart, even eBay) is likely to run some sort of alternative sale around then. All’s fair in love and shopping, right? </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11935639.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Welcome to the week where September ends and October begins; where Q4 kicks oﬀ and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/locking-in-tiktok-trend-personal-development"">collective lock-in</a> begins. Mars, the planet of action, is oﬃcially in Scorpio, the sign of intensity, precision, and transformation. This is the week to take your power back. To get organized about what actually matters, to follow through, to stop pretending someone’s coming to save you.<br /><br />We kick oﬀ with a First Quarter Moon in Capricorn on September 29, about a week after the Virgo Solar Eclipse. It’s our first cosmic checkpoint, a moment to assess how our new Moon intentions are landing in reality. Quarter Moons aren’t the flashiest lunations, but they’re often the most honest. In Capricorn, the Moon says: show me your progress, not your promises. For the collective, this lunation invites us to take practical, strategic steps toward our long-term goals, but also to hold ourselves and our institutions accountable. In a world full of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-focus-concentrate"">distractions and deflections</a>, Capricorn moons cut through the noise. They expose what’s been swept under the rug, from the personal to the political.</p>



<p>Then, on October 1, we experience a major energetic shift: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/06/9888932/asteroid-day-2020-astrology-meaning"">Juno, the asteroid</a> of marriage, enters Sagittarius. Asteroids represent archetypes, and Juno specifically rules soul contracts, loyalty, devotion, and commitments, both romantic and otherwise. In Scorpio, Juno made us crave all-or-nothing intensity: if it wasn’t soul-shaking, it wasn’t enough. But Juno in Sagittarius says <em>freedom is sexy too. </em>We may now crave more spaciousness in our partnerships, friendships, and even within ourselves. This is the season of sacred detachment: committing to growth without clinging, opening to love without losing ourselves. Whether you’re single, partnered, in community, or solo- traveling the cosmos, Juno in Sagittarius reminds us that devotion and exploration are not opposites. They can, and must, coexist.<br /><br />Finally, Mercury spends its final days in Libra this week, preparing to dive into Scorpio next week. As the planet of communication wraps up its journey through the sign of balance, justice, and relationships, we’re being invited to reflect on what we’ve learned about how we speak, listen, negotiate, and align. These final days are your last chance to make peace — with others or with yourself — before Mercury joins Mars in the deep waters of Scorpio. Let your words be bridges, not blades. Let your mind be open, not avoidant. Libra energy is often labeled indecisive, but in truth, it’s just thorough. Mercury in Libra is teaching us how to see the full picture, especially when it comes to love, justice, and truth.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, you’ve been reborn. Last week’s eclipse helped you recalibrate your daily flow and reconnect with your body’s wisdom. Now the Capricorn First Quarter Moon shines in your career and legacy sector, reminding you that ambition without purpose <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/burnout-at-work-recovery-tips"">leads to burnout</a>. What goals are worth sustaining through Q4? What are you chasing, and who are you chasing it for? You’re being asked to align your outer achievements with your inner truth. Don’t just move forward because you’re used to moving… move forward because your soul said “yes.”<br /><br />Meanwhile, Juno entering Sagittarius activates your sector of expansion and truth, making this a powerful time to redefine your relationship to commitment. Maybe you’re not meant to settle — maybe you’re meant to soar with someone who shares your vision. This transit could bring a romantic spark abroad, online, or in a classroom setting, or rekindle curiosity within an existing connection. Mercury’s final days in Libra land in your partnership sector, giving you one more chance to clarify what you want and how you want to be met. Don’t assume people know; say it, write it, show it.</p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, your beliefs are evolving. The Virgo eclipse reminded you that creativity is your birthright, not a luxury. Now the Capricorn First Quarter Moon activates your sector of expansion, travel, and higher learning, pushing you to take a leap: book the trip, say yes to the course, pitch the wild idea. What if the structure you crave is only waiting on your first step? It’s time to let yourself outgrow the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/childhood-nostalgic-memories-comfort"">comfort zone</a> that’s secretly become a cage. Let inspiration, not obligation, be your guide: Especially when the path feels unfamiliar.<br /><br />Juno’s entrance in Sagittarius activates your intimacy and transformation sector, asking you to expand your view of what deep connection looks like. Sometimes, the people we’re most bound to are also the ones we need to loosen our grip on. This transit can help you explore new levels of vulnerability, or reclaim power from contracts and entanglements that no longer serve your becoming. Mercury in Libra finishes its tour through your wellness and work sector, helping you clean up loose ends and restore balance before life gets more emotionally intense. Stay hydrated, reorganize your schedule, and remember: busyness is not proof of worth.</p>

<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, the eclipse last week cracked your heart open, and now you’re in the rebuilding stage. The Capricorn First Quarter Moon rises in your sector of shared resources and vulnerability, asking: who do you trust with your full self? Not just the witty surface — but the tender, complicated truth underneath. Where are you still performing instead of allowing yourself to be witnessed? This is a week to name what you need, even if it scares you. Especially if it scares you. Liberation starts with honesty.<br /><br />Juno’s shift into Sagittarius lands in your partnership sector, reigniting your desire for playfulness, honesty, and adventure in your relationships. Whether single or committed, you’re <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/how-to-end-a-situationship"">craving connections</a> that feel like freedom, not pressure. Think shared road trips, soul-expanding conversations, and laughing till your belly hurts… that’s the vibe. Mercury’s final stretch in Libra activates your sector of romance and joy, helping you flirt, charm, and express yourself with style. Create space for levity; your heart wants room to dance, not just overanalyze.</p>

<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, this month’s Virgo eclipse turned your attention to your words and thoughts, and now the Capricorn First Quarter Moon at the start of the week rises in your relationship sector, making it clear that communication isn’t just a skill… it’s a love language. This lunation may illuminate a partnership dynamic that feels out of alignment with your long-term vision. Are you truly feeling seen? Or are you shrinking to keep the peace? If tension surfaces this week, don’t avoid it. Navigate it with grace, but also with boundaries.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/06/9888932/asteroid-day-2020-astrology-meaning"">Juno entering Sagittarius</a> this week energizes your wellness and daily rhythm sector, encouraging you to prioritize commitments that keep you grounded. It’s time to treat your rituals — sleep, breathwork, walking, journaling — as sacred partnerships too. The fun begins when your nervous system feels safe. Mercury in Libra wraps up its journey through your home and emotional foundation sector, helping you bring peace and clarity to your inner world. Use these final days to declutter, both physically and emotionally, and make your inner sanctuary reflect the calm you crave.</p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, last week’s solar eclipse brought new awareness to your money mindset, and now the Capricorn First Quarter Moon activates your sector of wellness, structure, and routine. This is your cosmic check-in: are your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-activities-routine-week-long-challenge-essay"">daily habits</a> truly supporting the life you say you want? Where are you leaking time or energy, and what systems could help you plug those leaks? You don’t need a full overhaul — just one intentional change can create momentum. Structure isn’t a punishment, it’s a devotion to your future self.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Juno’s entrance in Sagittarius lights up your romance and joy sector, reminding you that love is allowed to be light, fun, and liberating. This is a beautiful transit for rekindling flirtation with others, with yourself, and with life. You might be surprised who catches your eye or how much more magnetic you feel when you stop trying so hard. Mercury’s final steps in Libra pass through your sector of communication and connection, so speak the desire, send the pitch, write the poem. Express your truth with flair… you’re a walking headline right now.<br /></p>

<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, last week’s solar eclipse in your sign was your cosmic reset, and now the Capricorn First Quarter Moon at the start of the week lands in your sector of creativity, play, and self-expression. What are you craving to create, simply <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2024/06/11736272/womens-bathroom-nightclubs-community-safety"">for the joy of it</a>? This isn’t about performance or productivity… it’s about letting your inner child lead. Are you giving yourself enough time to play? Or are you always “fixing” something — a person, a plan, a problem? Let joy be a valid goal, not just a byproduct.<br /><br />Juno entering Sagittarius this week energizes your home and roots sector, asking you to explore what freedom looks like inside of commitment. Maybe the “perfect family” was never the goal… maybe inner security is. This transit could inspire you to move, redecorate, or emotionally release something you inherited that no longer fits. Mercury finishes its journey through your sector of money and values, helping you reflect on what truly matters to you, beyond what society says should. What you value is shifting — and that’s a good thing. Trust it.</p>

<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, last week’s Virgo solar eclipse in your solitude sector brought your attention to the unconscious patterns shaping your life. Now as the First Quarter Moon rises in Capricorn on September 29th, your emotional foundation and sense of home come into focus. This is a moment to root down — not in nostalgia, but in truth. What makes you feel safe now, not 10 years ago? There may be a shift in family dynamics, your living situation, or even your inner dialogue. Don’t rush to fix it… just feel it and listen. You’re growing roots where your future self can bloom.</p>



<p>As the new month begins on October 1st, Juno enters Sagittarius and lights up your communication and curiosity sector, nudging you to speak from your gut instead of your script. This shift helps you break free from overthinking or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/people-pleasing-sex-life-satisfy-partner"">people-pleasing</a>, especially in your closest bonds. What conversations have you been avoiding for the sake of harmony? With Mercury finishing up its tour through your sign, you’re finding the clarity and courage to say what matters most — beautifully and boldly.</p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, the recent eclipse energized your social circles and future visions, and now the Capricorn First Quarter Moon on September 29th directs your attention to your communication sector. Your voice matters, but is it being heard in the way you intend? This is your cue to refine your message, double-check your tone, and make space for silence in between. Maybe it’s time to unplug and listen more. Or maybe it’s time to finally say the thing you’ve been afraid to articulate. Either way, your words have weight — so use them wisely.</p>



<p>In contrast to this grounding lunar energy, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/asteroids-astrology-horoscopes-meaning"">Juno shifts</a> out of your sign and enters Sagittarius on October 1st, activating your value and self-worth sector, and inviting you to commit to partnerships, romantic or professional, that support your sense of abundance. You’re being reminded that devotion and freedom can coexist. Relationships that feel financially or emotionally constricting may feel harder to ignore now. Meanwhile, Mercury in Libra wraps up its time in your spirituality sector, giving you a final chance to process, release, and prepare for Mercury’s arrival into your sign next week. Quiet time now will fuel your power moves later.</p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, the Virgo eclipse likely placed you at a crossroads in your career or public life. Now the Capricorn First Quarter Moon on September 29th brings your income, confidence, and sense of worth into sharper focus. What are you building, and do you believe it’s worth the eﬀort? You’re being called to reevaluate your relationship with discipline: Not as punishment, but as devotion to your bigger dreams. This lunation could inspire <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/loud-budgeting-money-boundaries"">a new budget</a>, business idea, or even a major investment in yourself. Don’t let imposter syndrome steer the wheel. </p>



<p>And as October begins, Juno, asteroid of commitment, enters your sign on October 1st, marking a fresh chapter in how you show up for yourself and others. This is your invitation to prioritize freedom <em>within </em>relationships, not <em>from </em>them. You may feel more drawn to people who mirror your truth and challenge your growth — or even decide you’re your own best partner for now. With Mercury finishing its time in Libra, your friendship and community sector feels more balanced, helping you discern which social connections are worth deepening as the year winds down.</p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, you’ve been restructured from the inside out since last week’s eclipse. Now, on September 29th, the First Quarter Moon rises in <em>your sign</em>, illuminating your identity, self-concept, and leadership style. It’s a checkpoint: what version of you is emerging, and are you letting them shine? This lunation is less about control and more about clarity. Let yourself release outdated expectations and step into the soft power of showing up <em>as you are</em>. You don’t have to have all the answers to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/short-women-confidence"">move with confidence</a> — you just have to trust the step you’re on.</p>



<p>As a counterbalance to this self-focused energy, Juno shifts into Sagittarius on October 1st, lighting up your spiritual and healing sector. This may inspire a quieter, more reflective approach to relationships. Who are you when no one’s watching? What sacred contracts are ready to be rewritten, especially around forgiveness or trust?Mercury’s final days in Libra land in your career sector, helping you smooth over past misunderstandings, wrap up lingering negotiations, and prepare for a more emotionally raw (and revealing) chapter once Mercury enters Scorpio. It’s a week for grounding <em>and </em>shedding. Prepare the soil for what’s next.</p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, this month’s Virgo solar eclipse likely stirred some deep truths around intimacy, fear, and letting go. Now the Capricorn First Quarter Moon on September 29th arrives in your subconscious and closure sector, shining light on the quiet parts of your psyche that need tending. This is your signal <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/slow-living-anti-hustle-culture"">to slow down</a> and listen. What are your dreams trying to tell you? What emotions have you buried under your intellectual strength? If you’re feeling more tired or tender this week, it’s not a weakness — it’s a sign of healing. Trust the wisdom in the pause.<br /><br />As a form of cosmic reorientation, October 1st brings Juno into Sagittarius, igniting your friendship and long-term vision sector. You’re ready to commit to people who get your weird, wild brilliance, and let go of bonds that keep you small or stagnant. Whether through organizing, collaborating, or reconnecting with soul friends, this is about building joyful communities rooted in mutual growth. Meanwhile, Mercury finishes up its stay in Libra in your expansion sector, helping you make sense of recent lessons and encouraging you to share them. Your voice is needed, especially when it’s so profoundly visionary.</p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, last week’s Virgo solar eclipse activated your relationship sector, and now the Capricorn First Quarter Moon on September 29th lights up your friendship and community sector, asking: who’s really walking this path with you? Who feels like family, and who feels like performance? This lunation helps you distinguish between loyalty and obligation and gives you the courage to realign. You may feel drawn to mentor someone, join a cause, or even set boundaries with a group you’ve outgrown. If it no longer aligns, it’s okay to swim elsewhere.<br /><br />As October begins, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/asteroids-astrology-horoscopes-meaning"">Juno enters Sagittarius</a> on October 1st, landing in your career and reputation sector, and inspiring you to take bold ownership of your public story. What does professional commitment look like <em>for you </em>— not for tradition, not for others? You may attract mentors, clients, or collaborators who push you to dream bigger but on your terms. Meanwhile, Mercury closes out its time in Libra in your depth and transformation sector, encouraging you to clear lingering energetic debts or financial entanglements. It’s a week of wise recalibration, so start by knowing what you want to be known for.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.hbomax.com/the-pitt""><em>The Pitt</em></a> is currently the best drama on television. I say that with my whole chest. And at <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/emmys-2025-red-carpet-best-dressed"">the Emmys</a> this month, the medical drama was officially awarded the honor. After taking home five Emmys, including <a href=""https://www.televisionacademy.com/awards/nominees-winners/2025/outstanding-drama-series"">Outstanding Drama Series</a>, the medical series was hit with a bit of backlash. Fans of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/03/11867875/severance-season-2-race-mr-milchick-natalie-black-characters"">Apple TV’s <em>Severance</em></a><em> </em>weren’t happy that their show lost to an “<a href=""https://twitter.com/eaganhelly/status/1967424841788821615?s=46"">easily digestible derivative piece of media</a>.” Yes, I’ve been holding a grudge ever since I read that post because not only does it prove the poster clearly hasn’t watched a single episode of<em> The Pitt</em> (if you watched <a href=""https://slate.com/culture/2025/03/the-pitt-tv-show-episode-12-max-mass-shooting-er-noah-wyle.html"">episode 12</a> and thought it was “easily digestible” you need therapy more than Dr. Robby), it also takes a condescending approach to all medical dramas. Sure, after two perfect seasons, <em>Grey’s Anatomy </em>devolved mostly into a saccharine soap opera (that I still loved), but comparing <em>The Pitt</em> to any other medical show — except for <em>ER</em>, and not just because they both star <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/noah-wyle-scrubs-tuxedo-figs-2025-emmys-1236371490/"">Noah Wyle</a> — is unfair and inaccurate. </p>



<p>Season 1 of<em> The Pitt </em>was great because it was unlike anything we’d see on TV for a long time, and in certain instances, ever. The <a href=""https://people.com/how-the-pitt-pulled-off-graphic-birth-scene-11697529"">birthing scene in episode 11</a> was the most accurate, gory, and riveting fictional depiction of childbirth in television history, in my opinion. And <em>The Pitt</em> tackled grief, miscarriage, mental health, mass shootings, and every sensitive case that came through the doors in 15 episodes with compassion, intention, and care in ways that felt revolutionary. In a time when science is being attacked, hospitals are becoming more and more dangerous for marginalized communities, and basic human decency is derided as “too woke,” <em>The Pitt </em>is firmly and unapologetically standing up for those who need the most help, just like good doctors do.  </p>

<p>Dr. Michael “Robby” Robinavitch (Wyle) is the show’s moral and calming center. Behind his tough exterior is a soft, empathetic leader, a doctor with a vulnerable and impeccable bedside manner, and a man wading through trauma in real time. But it’s not just Dr. Robby who makes <em>The Pitt </em>great. There’s Dr. Abbot (Shawn Hatosy), Dr. Collins (Tracy Ifeachor), Dr. Santos (Isa Briones), Dr. Mohan (Supriya Ganesh), Dr. Langdon (Patrick Ball), Dr. McKay (Fiona Dourif), Dr. Javadi (Shabana Azeez), Dr. King (Taylor Deardon), Dr. Whitaker (Gerran Howell), and the nurses Mateo (Jalen Thomas Brooks), Perlah (Amielynn Abellera), Princess (Kristin Villanueva), and Dana (Katherine LaNasa). </p>

<p>Every single one of the aforementioned characters leap off the screen with depth, authenticity, and individuality. And after Season 1, each one left audiences wanting to clock into another shift at The Pitt. And we’re in luck because the HBO series has been renewed for a second season (it’s already in production) and recently set a record for post-season viewership growth since its finale in April, more than any debut season of any HBO Max show, <a href=""https://deadline.com/2025/09/the-pitt-post-season-audience-record-after-emmys-1236553026/"">according to Deadline.</a></p>



<p>With the help of the cast and industry reports, here’s what we know about <em>The Pitt </em>season 2:</p>



<h2><strong>Most of the cast is returning</strong></h2>



<p>Like any good workplace, the thing that makes <em>The Pitt </em>so great is the people. And if you fell in love with the ragtag group of doctors and nurses during their 15-hour emergency department shift, we’re happy to report that most of the cast is back for Season 2. At the Warner Bros. pre-Emmys celebration party in LA this month, we caught up with a few cast members and they confirmed who will and won’t be back. Fresh off her Emmy win, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ladylanasa/?hl=en"">Katherine LaNasa</a>, who plays nurse Dana Evans, will return to the show. “It’s really just felt like a gift from heaven. I’m not kidding,” LaNasa told me on the red carpet about playing Dana. </p>



<p>“I had a really hard time finding work during a lockdown when I couldn’t go and do live auditions and [then] I got cancer. And I was like,<em> I don’t understand what’s happening…. </em>and then I got this job where all of my experience of being a patient, being in the hospital, came into play, and it was just a really spiritual experience.” LaNasa will continue that spiritual experience in Season 2. Even though Dana was punched in the face by a patient and seemed intent on quitting at the end of Season 1, the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuZnRRVWnbQ"">teaser trailer for <em>The Pitt</em></a> season 2, however, confirmed that <a href=""https://screenrant.com/the-pitt-season-2-dana-nurse-lead-not-quit/"">Dana is still at the hospital</a> and still acting as the emergency room’s charge nurse.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>All I will say it’s that it’s pretty gross.</p><cite>Supriya Ganesh on ‘the pitt’ season 2</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“There was something I did already [for Season 2] and I told the producer that I think I needed some jewelry for it. Like he needed to give me some diamonds,” <a href=""https://variety.com/2025/tv/columns/the-pitt-katherine-lanasa-disgusting-scene-season-2-1236491630/"">LaNasa teased to Variety</a>. “You’ll see. It’s in Episode 2. It’s disgusting.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936022.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>Samira assess Joyce’s pain levels, and tells Whitaker to have some empathy. (Warrick Page/MAX)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Supriya Ganesh, who plays Dr. Samira Mohan also teased the graphic hospital depictions — aka blood and gore — will be dialed up a notch. “All I will say it’s that it’s pretty gross and we have some cool things planned. Keep an eye out for the first couple of episodes,” she told us on the Emmys red carpet, also foreshadowing some deeper storylines for her character in Season 2.  “I think everyone has questions about who Samira is. They have questions about her past and her background. I love that everyone is so in my corner.” </p>



<p>Alexandra Metz (Dr. Garcia), Fiona Dourif (Dr. McKay), Taylor Deardon (Dr. Mel King), Isa Briones (Dr. Santos), Gerron Howell (Dr. Whitaker), Shabana Azeez (Dr. Javadi) and of course Emmy winners Noah Wyle (Dr. Robby) and Shawn Hatosy (Dr Abbot) will also be back. </p>



<h2><strong>Dr. Heather Collins will not be back for Season 2 &amp; here’s why</strong></h2>



<p><em>The Pitt</em> fans were shocked when news broke in July that <a href=""https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-pitt-tracy-ifeachor-exits-heather-collins-season-2-1236452804/"">Dr. Heather Collins</a>, played by Tracy Ifeachor, would <a href=""https://tvline.com/casting-news/the-pitt-tracy-ifeachor-leaving-heather-collins-season-2-cast-1235472196/"">not be returning for Season 2</a>.  “The creative team said it all — it was a <a href=""https://tvline.com/news/the-pitt-tracy-ifeachor-collins-season-2-noah-wyle-interview-1235474096/"">decision that they made</a> based on the story they wanted to tell,” Ifeachor told me at the Warner Bros pre-Emmys party. “And I respect their decision and their right to do that.” <a href=""https://deadline.com/2025/07/the-pitt-noah-wyle-tracy-ifeachor-departure-1236457870/"">TVLine and Deadline reported</a> that Ifeachor would depart the series due to a “creative decision” and that the storyline just didn’t call for Dr. Collins’ return. In Season 1, the character suffered a miscarriage and left her shift early. She did not come back and was absent from the latter half of the season. After lots of online speculation (including <a href=""https://www.thecut.com/article/tracy-ifeachor-the-pitt-church-jesus-house-rumors.html"">unsubstantiated rumors about Ifeachor being a part of a church</a> with anti-abortion, homophobic and all-around conservative views), <a href=""https://deadline.com/2025/07/the-pitt-noah-wyle-tracy-ifeachor-departure-1236457870/"">Wyle shut down any reasons</a> for her departure other than storytelling: “We’ve all been sort of amused by the speculation about what everybody thinks might be a reason,” <a href=""https://deadline.com/2025/07/the-pitt-noah-wyle-tracy-ifeachor-departure-1236457870/"">Wyle told Deadline</a>. “But truthfully, we loved the actress. We enjoyed having her with us very much. She’s gotten really big and we will miss her.” <br /></p>

<p>And here’s what Ifeachor told us: “I’m so grateful for HBO for ensuring that there was no kind of crazy stuff out there,” she said of the online speculation surrounding her exit. “I mean, sometimes you read this stuff, you’re like, <em>No one’s gonna believe that. </em>Then you get messages, “are you okay? What happened?” It’s the industry, and it happens like that,” she said, maintaining that there was no truth to the rumors (which her <a href=""https://www.themirror.com/entertainment/tv/hbo-show-cast-member-axed-1261766"">publicist also vehemently denied</a>). “The thing I remain most proud of is the work ethic. I lead with kindness, I lead with integrity, and I show up, and I do what I’m there to do.” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Dr. Collins is part of the foundation [of ‘The Pitt’, part of the fabric, and nothing will ever change that.</p><cite>tracy ifeachor on not returning for season 2</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Ifeachor also squashed any rumors of beef between the cast. “I love that so many of the cast wrote that lovely tribute to me. They’re like, ‘we miss her. She’s so beautiful.’ I was like,<em> Oh, thank you!” </em>I can also confirm that based on how the cast was acting backstage at the Emmys, they all seemed like friendly coworkers who like and respect each other. There were lots of laughs and hugs — yes, with Ifeachor included — as they waited backstage to claim their Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series. As for Dr. Collins, she was one of my favorite characters in the series and I’m devastated she won’t be returning. Ifeachor knows the impact the character has. “She’s just such a powerful character, Dr. Heather Collins,” Ifeachor said. “Obviously, when we’re making it, we never know what we’re gonna be making. So to have a character that landed so well and so unexpectedly is wonderful, and I wouldn’t change that for the world. She’s part of the foundation, part of the fabric, and nothing will ever change that.” <br /></p>



<h2><strong>Dr. Langdon will be back, fresh from rehab</strong></h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.imdb.com/news/ni65087998/"">Patrick Ball’s Dr. Langdon</a> may be <em>The Pitt’s </em>most polarizing character. Season 1 fans either loved or hated him. To recap, in Season 1, Langdon was caught by Dr. Santos stealing medication from the hospital — which Dr. Robby was <em>not</em> happy about to say the least — and he was revealed to be a drug addict. Season 2 kicks off with Dr. Langdon’s first day back in the pitt, on July 4, ten months after the events of Season 1. I’m sure Dr. Langdon is going to have to deal with a lot of backlash and rumors in the halls of the hospital and Ball has been facing the blowback of his character’s actions on the internet. When I asked him if he’s seen the discourse, he confirmed he has. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936027.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>“Yeah. I mean, I had to get off Twitter because it was a lot,” Ball said on the Warner Bros. red carpet. “But I think it’s a really smart story that [showrunner R. Scott Gemmill] is telling. And I think telling the story of addiction is really important to me, and to tell it with as much integrity as possible.” He continued: “I think we have done a pretty good job of setting up an archetype of somebody that is confident and somebody that is good at their job, and exposed that even those people can be suffering silently and often do.” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Telling the story of addiction is really important to me, and to tell it with as much integrity as possible.</p><cite>patick ball (dr. langdon)</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Ball also weighed in on the rivalry between his character and Dr. Santos.<em> The Pitt</em> fans have picked sides, and Dr. Langdon vs. Dr Santos is going to be the most anticipated showdown in Season 2. </p>



<p>“I definitely have to surf my internet haters, for sure, but I think, especially, the back and forth between Langdon and Santos invited a lot of really interesting conversations,” Ball said. “So I’m here for it. Hate on!” </p>



<h2><strong>The show is having a huge impact on real healthcare workers</strong></h2>



<p>When I talked to the cast of <em>The Pitt</em>, the overwhelming sentiment was gratitude to the real-life healthcare workers they’ve encountered who have felt “so seen” by the show. “The medical professionals really feel seen, and [when I had cancer] I know that there were some nurses that went above and beyond when I was getting treatment and the little things mattered so much,” LaNasa said. “And so I tried to put that into Dana.” </p>

<p>“<em>I </em>feel so seen,” Metz (Dr. Garcia) told me. “I’m now stopped on the street by my people of color, my women of color, who are like I see you, you’re representing! And then I’m like ‘what do you do?’ and they’re like, ‘I’m in the sciences, I work in [hospitals] and I’m like, ‘I see <em>you.’ </em>We are out here. Period.” </p>



<p>Ifeachor also shared that she has women coming up to her and sharing how her character made them feel represented. “So so many women have come up to me often with tears and told me how they really felt seen,” she said. “I’ve heard and women from all different backgrounds, and that, to me, has been the most wonderful experience…. I’m grateful I watched something like 300 hours of footage of people talking about miscarriages and different choices that they have made so I’m really grateful that it translated, because you make it, and you hope so. I’m really glad that that came across.” </p>



<p>“I get stopped a lot by medical professionals,” Fiona Dourif (Dr McKay) told me on the Warner Bros pre-Emmys red carpet. “A lot of nurses come up to me and say that they’ve never seen something that actually reflects their work so that’s been really cool.” </p>

<p><em>Welcome to</em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/money-diary""><em> </em>Money Diaries</a><em> where we are tackling the ever-present taboo that is money. We’re asking real people how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period — and we’re tracking every last dollar.<br /><br />Today: a social worker working who makes $103,693 per year and who spends some of her money this week on keeping her dog happy and occupied.</em></p>



<p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Social worker<br /><strong>Industry:</strong> Healthcare<br /><strong>Age:</strong> 48<br /><strong>Location:</strong> New York<br /><strong>Salary:</strong> $103,694<br /><strong>Assets:</strong> Investment accounts: $384,373.19; Roth IRA: $215,057.49; annuities: 306,796.84; savings account: $1222.78. I also have a high yield savings account with about $700 in it. I currently pay into my work pension plan and have pension plans from my last two jobs<br /><strong>Debt:</strong> Mortgage: $185,624.18.<br /><strong>Paycheck Amount (Every Other Week):</strong> $2,575.76.

Yup, right at the beginning of COVID-19. When I signed the purchase agreement I was home sick myself, strangely not with COVID-19, despite having all the symptoms. A few days later NYC completely shut down. The building I was moving to paused all move-ins which is why I didn’t move in until June. The building I was living in allowed me to go month to month until I could move. I was able to put half down and got a great interest rate of 3.375%. Mortgage: $923.98; monthly maintenance fee (which includes $55 for cable/internet): $1,696.61; there is a current capital assessment of $363.80 which will end in October. ConEd: varies monthly to month. This month my bill is $124.42.<br /><strong>Loan Payments:</strong> Affirm for Peloton bike purchase (0% interest paid off within a year): $138.02.<br /><strong>Peloton All-Access Membership: </strong>$44<br /><strong>Netflix:</strong> $19.59<br /><strong>Spotify Premium: </strong>$11.99 <br /><strong>Hulu: </strong>$18.99 (it’s automatically charged to my Amex, which then credits the full amount).<br /><strong>Cell Phone: </strong>$116.69<br /><strong>Dog Walker: </strong>$93.80 (weekly, for three walks per week). </p>



<p><strong>Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?<br /></strong>Yes: My maternal grandmother was the reason I went to college, though there wasn’t much discussion surrounding the topic. I was told I was going to college and that’s it. I have a Bachelor of Arts, Juris Doctor degree, and a Master of Social Work. All of it was paid for from the funds of my structured settlement.<br /><br /><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?<br /></strong>I don’t remember having many conversations about money. When I was a teenager, I learned that I was getting a certain amount per year or every three or four years (more on this later). My grandmother told me college would be paid for and explained how. I didn’t know the full details of the settlement until I was well into my 20s. My dad did take me to a financial advisor one year to start an investment account.<br /><br /><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?<br /></strong>My first job was at Wendy’s when I was in high school. I was expected to pay for my own car insurance.<br /><br /><strong>Did you worry about money growing up?<br /></strong>I guess I never really thought about it when I was a kid. Neither of my parents went to college (mom was an LPN and dad worked in a factory), but I never wanted for anything.<br /><br /><strong>Do you worry about money now?<br /></strong>All the time. It’s crazy when I actually look at the numbers. I feel like I’m somewhat ok. But I constantly worry there won’t be enough/it’s going to run out, etc.<br /><br /><strong>At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?<br /></strong>Probably when I got my first job at 16. In order to drive, I was expected to pay for my own insurance. After that, I’ve supported myself through work and funds from the structured settlement.<br /><br /><strong>Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.<br /></strong>Yes: My mom was killed by a drunk driver when I was a child. He happened to be driving a company vehicle. My family successfully sued the company. The funds then went into a structured settlement and I received an annuity payment every four to five years up until I was in my late 30s. The annuity payments increased every year and the last one was the biggest. Also, as I mentioned above, before I started high school, my grandmother told me I was getting approximately $1,000 per month, which would last for four years and which would pay for my tuition (I went to a private school). After that, I would get a lump sum once a year for the four years I was in college, which would pay my college tuition. And then after that, I would get a lump sum payment every four of five years, which lasted until my late 30s.</p>



<h3><strong>Day One: Sunday</strong></h3>



<p>7:30 a.m. — My dog starts barking and it’s time for me to get up and take him out. Before we go out, I start coffee so I can have a cup when we come back in. We go for a short walk around the neighborhood and he does all his business. I feed him when we get back and then grab my coffee.</p>



<p>1 p.m. — I’m trying to have the laziest day possible, but my dog is having none of it. He brings me toys to throw and we do that for a while. I want to nap and/or work out but I don’t think either is going to happen today. I have a big week coming up and I’m really just trying to mentally prepare myself for that. I had breakfast earlier but I’m not really interested in any food right now.</p>



<p>5 p.m. — I am off from work today so I basically spend the whole day relaxing, playing with my dog, and trying to nap. I start to get hungry as we are out on a walk. Even though I have one more HelloFresh meal to make, I do not feel like cooking. Decide to order Chop’t for pick-up and walk over with the dog. I get a Santa Fe wrap and we head home. <strong>$17.94</strong></p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — After I eat, I realize I don’t have anything to eat for breakfast for the week. Luckily, there is a Morton Williams across the street. I get yogurt (4 for $5), a Lean Cuisine, protein bars, jell-o vanilla chocolate swirl pudding (an impulse purchase), and two mini bags of Tate’s chocolate chip cookies. <strong>$25.24</strong></p>



<p>9:30 p.m. — I start getting things ready for work tomorrow. I make sure my work bag is packed and I put some of the items I just bought into my lunch bag (which is really just a NYPL tote bag). I take the dog out one more time then get in the shower. After that I watch a <em>Friends</em> re-run before going to bed.</p>



<p>11 p.m. — I try to be in bed around 11 p.m. and tonight I am successful. I make sure the pup is settled and then it’s lights out. I scroll through a few podcasts and eventually end up on a <em>Going West </em>episode. Most of what I listen to is true crime. One of my friends does not understand how I can listen to true crime while I am trying to go to sleep. I don’t really have an answer for that!</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $43.18</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Two: Monday</strong></h3>



<p>6:30 a.m. — My alarm goes off. I hit snooze a few times then drag myself out of bed. I get dressed to take my dog outside. I grab some cash before we go out so I can buy some fruit from the fruit stand on the corner. I get a large box of strawberries, blueberries, and three pears. <strong>$7</strong></p>



<p>7:30 a.m. — After the walk, I come back inside and get ready for work. I make sure the dog is fed and then proceed to get food together for the day. I pack breakfast (almost always yogurt, berries, and granola), which I will eat at work. I also throw in a protein bar, a stick of cheese, a pear, and leftovers from one of my HelloFresh meals. I head out the door to catch the bus to work. <strong>$2.90</strong></p>



<p>8:15 a.m. — I have an appointment to see a rehab doctor first thing this morning. I was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer back in January. Since then, I’ve had surgery and completed four rounds of dose-dense chemo. I’ve had pain in my legs since my second round of chemo which was back in May. It hurts to walk and sometimes my legs feel weak when I stand. I also fell in my apartment back in May when my dog peed on the floor. I didn’t see it, slipped, and fell hard on my knee. I got x-rays the day after and nothing was broken but my knee continues to bother me. I pay my copay when I check in. The doctor tells me I likely have a bone bruise on my knee. He is going to prescribe an anti-inflammatory for my legs and refer me to physical therapy. <strong>$25</strong></p>



<p>12 p.m. — The last part of my cancer treatment is radiation. I completed 15 of 20 treatments and this is my last week of treatment. My appointments are always around lunchtime so I head to radiation and prepare myself to wait. My appointments are only scheduled for 20 minutes but sometimes they are running so far behind that I’ve waited up to two hours for treatment. Once again, they are running late. After about an hour and half, they send me up to another floor. When I get up there, I’m taken back immediately. Everything is fine. The radiation hits one side and then moves to my other side. I am on the table with my eyes closed when I hear a loud bang. I think the ceiling is falling down! Staff runs in and it turns out it was something on the radiation machine that wasn’t secured but the machine still works. My other side then gets radiation and I’m done. As I’m getting ready to leave, I check the Crumbl app just for the hell of it. I see they have a pumpkin chocolate chip cookie. I decide I need this after the chaos at radiation. I order ahead and it’s ready when I get there. <strong>$5.94</strong></p>



<p>7 p.m. — I open up Zoom for my appointment with my Psych NP. I’ve been seeing him since 2017 for anxiety and depression. We meet every three months or so for a check-in and medication refills. Typically, I would request reimbursement from my FSA for the fee but between copays and medical bills from my cancer diagnosis, that is long gone. I give him updates on my treatment and tell him that despite everything going on, I am doing relatively well. We also discuss the Cowboy Carter Tour. He tells me he was so close to Beyoncé he could touch her! <strong>$300</strong></p>



<p>8 p.m. — The rest of my workday is super chill. I make some phone calls and eventually eat my leftovers. I am counting down until the end of the day. I work three 12-hour days and have to be back at work in 12 hours. I decide to take a Lyft home. I get home and immediately take my dog out for a walk. We come back inside, I feed him and we play fetch for awhile. He’s a little over a year old and has endless energy. I do not. I eventually shower and get into bed around 11 p.m. <strong>$23.05</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $363.89</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Three: Tuesday</strong></h3>



<p>7:30 a.m. — My alarm is just cruel at this point. I wake up and take the dog out. When we come back, I make coffee and feed him. I then get ready for work. When I am done, I get my food ready for the day. Once again it’s yogurt, granola, and berries for breakfast. I throw more of the same from yesterday (protein bar, cheese, a pear, and HelloFresh leftovers). I walk over to catch the bus for work. <strong>$2.90</strong></p>



<p>10 a.m. — I got paid last week and decide I need a new T-shirt from Beyond Yoga. Their featherweight tee has some great colors right now and I order one in dark maroon. When I go to check out, I discover that healthcare workers get a 20% discount! I submit my credentials, which are quickly accepted, and place my order. Thanks Beyond Yoga! <strong>$51.20</strong></p>



<p>10:30 a.m. — After the fun of buying new clothes, I get serious and check out my credit card statements. I have 3, 2 AmExes and one Chase United rewards card. I make all big purchases on my Chase card so I get the miles. I use one Amex mostly for Lyft and the other one for things like the vet and my NP. I try to pay all of them off each month. I pay half on the card linked to my Lyft account, which is more than usual due to two airport rides in July. The other half I will pay out of my next paycheck. I pay the balance due on the Chase. <strong>$283.19</strong></p>



<p>12 p.m. — I walk over to my radiation appointment. Things are running much smoother today. I’m in and out within an hour. I usually make a coffee when I am there with a vanilla caramel cream pod but there’s none of those today. I am exhausted so I order a caramel macchiato from Starbucks ($6.83) and go to pick it up. I had money on my Starbucks card and pay for it from there. </p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — After I pick up my Starbucks, I have a craving for empanadas from Sophie’s and it’s been a minute since I’ve been there. They have a three for $10 deal so I get two beef and one guava and cheese and I head back to the office. When I get back, I give one of the beef to my coworker. I also offer half of the guava and cheese but she declines. <strong>$13.37</strong></p>



<p>5 p.m. — I’m still at work and ready to go home. I have the next three days off so I am holding on as much as I can. We end up getting a call to go see a patient in the community. It’s a location and person we know so we head out. We have to see the patient within a certain timeframe so we can take a Lyft which is linked to a corporate account. The visit ends up being quick as the person does not want to speak with us. My coworker and I head back to the office. I spend the rest of time writing notes and making phone calls. <strong>$14.39</strong> (Expensed)</p>



<p>8 p.m. — Finally my day is over! I walk over to catch the bus home. Once I get home, I take the dog out for a walk. We play fetch again when we get back inside. I decide to do a puzzle on my iPad but I fall asleep on the couch while doing it. It’s 12:30 a.m. by the time I wake up so I gather myself, put the dog in his crate, and immediately get back into bed. <strong>$2.90</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $353.56</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Four: Wednesday</strong></h3>



<p>9 a.m. — On my off days, my dog is my alarm clock. He will start barking and will not stop until I am up. It’s rare he lets me sleep past 7:30 a.m. Today, it was 7:15 a.m. It’s ok though as he is going to doggie day care later. He usually goes once a week on one of my off days to give us a break from each other. On the walk over to day care, I stop at CVS (which is one of his favorite places) to pick up the prescriptions my NP refilled. After a short wait, I get the medications and walk him over to day care. <strong>$22.06</strong></p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — I catch the bus to go to radiation. Only three more sessions! Today runs pretty smoothly and I am again in and out within the hour. I am starting to get hungry but don’t want anything big. There is a market near the bus stop that has a really good tuna pasta salad. I go in and get a small container. I then get on the bus and head home. <strong>$12.04</strong></p>



<p>5 p.m. — When I get home from radiation my plan is to nap, do a load of laundry, and work out. I end up falling asleep on the couch around 3 p.m. I sleep for a solid two hours. When I get up, I put on workout clothes and gather up the dog’s blankets to wash. He is potty trained and there are potty pads for him but he continues to pee in his crate or on his bed when he is mad. Luckily, I have laundry in my building. I go downstairs and put the blankets in the wash. When I come back upstairs, I get on my Peloton and do a five-minute warmup, a 30-minute class, and a five-minute cool down. After I am done, I run downstairs and put the laundry in the dryer. <strong>$4.25</strong></p>



<p>7:15 p.m. — I walk over to pick up my dog from day care. I try to leave him there for as long as I can so he can run out all his energy. He’s a staff favorite there. They bring him out and he gets a treat before we leave. He doesn’t want to walk when we leave so I pick him up and carry him the rest of the way. He tries to play a little when we get home and I don’t understand how he’s not exhausted. Eventually he gives up and is knocked out. Once he falls I sleep I doomscroll, play Candy Crush, and watch reruns of the OG<em> Law &amp; Order</em> before I go to bed around 11 p.m. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $38.35</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Five: Thursday</strong></h3>



<p>11 a.m. — I am up again around 7:30 a.m. I take the dog for a walk and we relax until it’s time for me to leave for radiation. Around 11 a.m., I get a text letting me know that T-mobile debited my account for my cell phone bill. After this, I get ready to leave and am out the door around 11:30 a.m. to catch the bus to treatment. </p>



<p>1:30 p.m — It’s a miracle! Today I am in and out of radiation in 30 minutes. I see my doctor after treatment and this is the first week that I am actually on time for my appointment. He tells me that my scans look great. He also tells me what to expect of the next few weeks which can include skin peeling and continued darkening of the skin. I head to Trader Joe’s after I leave my appointment. I buy coffee (the most important thing!), more yogurt, milk, protein bars, granola, bread, a mini pumpkin spice sheet cake, and some other items. I am a sucker for Trader Joe’s pumpkin items. I hope the pumpkin biscotti are back soon. <strong>$52.53</strong></p>



<p>2 p.m. — After I leave Trader Joe’s I walk down to PetCo to pick up a few cans of wet food that I mix with my dog’s dried food. I look at some treats and toys but just get the food. When I leave, I walk over to the bus stop to head home. When I get home, I put all the groceries away and make a HelloFresh meal. I eat and spend time with the dog before I get ready for the Liberty game. <strong>$5.86</strong></p>



<p>5:45 p.m. — My friend and I did a partial season ticket plan for the Liberty this year. The games are so fun and the crowd is always amazing. I also secretly want to be a Timeless Torch. They’re playing the Sky tonight and although I am cheering for the Liberty, I am looking forward to seeing Angel Reese play. I get down to Barclay’s and meet my friend and we head in. <strong>$2.90</strong></p>



<p>6:50 p.m. — Once we are inside we stop for snacks and drinks before going to our seats. I got popcorn the last game I went to and it was so good. I want to get it again but I decide to get a High Noon Black Cherry as an early celebration for my last day of radiation, which is tomorrow. My friend gets a hot dog. We then head to our seats and settle in for the game. <strong>$17</strong></p>



<p>9:15 p.m. — The game did not go how I expected and the Liberty lost. My friend wanted to go to Chick-fil-A after, so we walk over there. I’m hungry too and decide to get a five-piece nugget and an order of fries ($6.14). A lot of folks from the game are there so it’s super busy. I need to eat my food before I go home otherwise it will be cold. Luckily there’s an open table so we sit down and I eat my food. After we are done, I get on the train to head home ($2.90). <strong>$9.04</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $87.33</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Six: Friday</strong></h3>



<p>10:30 a.m. — I get an email from the dog walking company letting me know my account has been debited for this week’s walks. It’s $5 more this week because one of the walks is on Saturday. Because I work 12 hours, he gets walked on the days I work each week. He seems to be anxious on the days I am not there. I have come home to ripped up potty pads, poop on his bed, and general gremlin things. He seems to be getting better but still continues to chew on things, with his current obsession being the cable wire. </p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — I get the bus to the clinic for my last day of radiation and last day of treatment overall! It almost feels surreal. The last seven months of my life have been consumed by this. It’s been quite the journey but I made it. There’s not a long wait today and I go back pretty quickly. After it’s over, I thank the radiation techs for all they’ve done and for taking such good care of me. They wished me the best and said not to come back. When I am done, I go over to the bell to take a selfie. A kind woman in the waiting room offers to take some photos for me. I end up ringing the bell and she records it. The people in the waiting room clap for me and offer congratulations. It’s very overwhelming. <strong>$2.90 </strong></p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — I decide to take myself out for a celebratory lunch. I go to this café that I’ve wanted to try and order a glass of rosé and a pizza with burrata and truffle oil. It’s delicious. I take my time there and read a little bit of the book I have with me. Eventually, I leave and start walking home. On the way, I pass one of my favorite wine bars which has $7 wines for happy hour. It’s such a beautiful day so I stop there for a glass of rosé which turns into two. I sit there for a while and end up finishing my book. I am slightly tipsy when I leave and I walk home. <strong>$68.61</strong></p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — I take the dog out when I get home. We play for a while. I exchange some voice messages with one of my BFFs. I get hungry again around 7:30 p.m. so I make steak tacos which is one of my HelloFresh meals. I eat dinner and clean up. I have to work tomorrow so I am settling in for the night and biding my time until 20/20. I only make it a half hour before I fall asleep on the couch. </p>



<p>10:30 p.m. — The dog wakes me up so he can get off the couch. He then brings me a toy to throw for him. I am so tired and just can’t do it. I drift back off until he brings me another toy and starts barking. This goes on until I decide it’s actually time for bed. I put on my pajamas, put him in his gated area and crawl into bed.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $71.51</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Seven: Saturday</strong></h3>



<p>6:15 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I hit snooze as per usual. I am absolutely exhausted but drag myself out of bed. I take out the dog. When we come back in, I get ready for work. Somehow I get myself together to pack my breakfast and snacks for the day.</p>



<p>7:30 a.m. — I order a Lyft to get to work. I typically take one when I work on the weekend as my usual bus doesn’t start running until a little later. I could take the local bus, but I always worry I’m going to be late if I take it. <strong>$21.98</strong></p>



<p>8:45 a.m. — I get to work and see we have an appointment first thing this morning. I am very familiar with this patient and the building they live in. We end up taking a Lyft to the appointment. The appointment is productive and we devise a follow-up plan. <strong>$17.60</strong> (Expensed)</p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — We have another appointment this afternoon. The individual is within walking distance so my coworker and I walk over to meet them. We spend some time walking around the neighborhood and talking to her. She was very thankful and grateful for our time today.</p>



<p>2 p.m. — We get back to the office and I start writing notes from the interactions I had today. While working on those, I get a call from another patient who needs assistance. I talk with them and their sibling and give them ideas and instructions on what they should do next.</p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — I get a call from one of my colleagues letting me know they are now meeting with the patient I spoke to on the phone earlier. I provide my colleague details of my interaction with the patient earlier. They are being evaluated and my colleague will update me when she can.</p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — I start working on my sign-out for the person who will be working tomorrow. It’s something we do each night so the person working the next day can see what was done and what, if anything needs a follow-up. After that is finished, I start gathering my belongings to leave for the night.</p>



<p>8 p.m. — My workday is over! I walk to the bus to head home. I take the dog out when I get home. We play for a while but I am tired. I am in bed by 11:30 p.m. and hope the pup will let me sleep in tomorrow. <strong>$2.90</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $24.88</strong></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><strong><br /></strong>“As I was typing in things, I thought to myself, ‘This is a lot,’ but I don’t know that I’d necessarily change things moving forward. Some of my expenses this week were not things that I typically spend money on. I considered my lunch and wine stop a special occasion since I finished treatment.”</p>

<p><em>Welcome to</em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/money-diary""><em> </em>Money Diaries</a><em> where we are tackling the ever-present taboo that is money. We’re asking real people how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period — and we’re tracking every last dollar.<br /><br />Today: a senior PR and communications manager who has a $220,000 joint income and who spends some of her money this week on a stitch crochet kit that was an impulse buy.</em></p>



<p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Senior manager, PR and communications<br /><strong>Industry:</strong> Retail<br /><strong>Age:</strong> 35<br /><strong>Location:</strong> Brooklyn<br /><strong>Salary:</strong> $112,128<br /><strong>Joint Income/Financial Setup:</strong> ~$220,000. My partner A., freelances so his income varies around $60,000-$120,000 depending on how busy he stays. We split most things 50/50. We are domestic partners and he is on my company’s health insurance plan, so he also pays me back the additional deduction and taxes taken out of my paycheck to cover him.<br /><strong>Assets:</strong> 401(k): $74,513; Roth IRA: $14,841.<br /><strong>Debt:</strong> $5,015 on credit cards.<br /><strong>Paycheck Amount (Bi-Weekly):</strong> $2,518 after taxes and deductions + $222 from my partner.<br /><strong>Pronouns:</strong> She/her<br /><br /><strong>Monthly Expenses<br /><br />Housing Costs:</strong> $1,660 for my half of a one-bedroom.<br /><strong>401(k): </strong>5% contribution with 4% employer match.<br /><strong>Transit Deductions:</strong> $50, pre tax.<br /><strong>Pet Insurance:</strong> $26 for my half.<br /><strong>Gym: </strong>$19<br /><strong>Phone: </strong>$75<br /><strong>Utilities: </strong>Varies anywhere from $150-$250.</p>



<p><strong>Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?<br /></strong>Yes, college was always expected. I come from an immigrant family, and everything my parents did was to set my siblings and myself up for a future. I was a high-achieving student at a competitive public school, and attended a top state university. My parents participated in a 529 plan and pre-purchased my in-state tuition when I was around 8 years old, making it considerably inexpensive. I believe they paid $22,000 for all four years, which I was extremely grateful for.<br /><br /><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?<br /></strong>We were middle class but my parents were very frugal, since they both grew up poor in their home countries. Since arriving in the US, it’s always been very important for them to have a great credit score, so they never missed a payment and saved every penny. We hardly ever ate out and only went on a vacation maybe every other year. However, my mom was also able to retire early, and I know they will also leave a comfortable inheritance for my sibling and myself.<br /><br /><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?<br /></strong>My first job was a hostess at a restaurant when I was 15. I mainly got the job to start earning pocket money for myself. I worked for a few years in the restaurant industry throughout high school and saved enough to buy a used car (my parents’ old car), as well as for a solo trip to Europe when I turned 18 and graduated. I had only been to Canada and Mexico previously.<br /><br /><strong>Did you worry about money growing up?<br /></strong>A bit: we could afford all the essentials but never had “fun” money. I got used to shopping for things on sale or thrifting, which is something I still carry with me to this day. There were lots of times in high school when I would wish we had money to buy the trendy things I saw other girls wearing. I do remember one time in elementary school, we were going on a “Little House on the Prairie” field trip, and we had to buy these old-fashioned costumes, but they were pricey and my mom couldn’t afford them. I tried to tell the teacher I was going to skip the field trip but she insisted on it. We ended up finding something at Goodwill, even though it was not the exact style. However, I’m glad my parents instilled a frugality mindset in me now, because it helps me budget an average salary in an expensive city.<br /><br /><strong>Do you worry about money now?<br /></strong>Yes, more so now. Even though I can split expenses with my partner A., we are both victims of lifestyle creep from time to time. Most of our disposable income goes towards going out, eating out, and traveling. I admit I do also have a bit of a shopping problem (especially working in fashion!) which has accumulated a bit of credit card debt.<br /><br /><strong>At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?<br /></strong>At 22, when I graduated. I worked part time throughout college but my parents still helped out with certain things like my car insurance. I don’t have a financial safety net right now, which is something I am going to work towards once I pay off my credit cards. Technically, I could use my 401(k) in an emergency, and both A. and I have supportive parents who would help us out if absolutely needed. But I prefer to be independent and have my own funds.<br /><br /><strong>Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.<br /></strong>Yes, last year my parents started my Roth IRA and contribute the max $7,000 every year, as I did not want to contribute beyond my 401(k). This is partially a hobby of my mother’s, who has been playing with the stock market since she retired early. She likes to “play” with my retirement money but will give any earnings to me. Win-win.</p>



<h3><strong>Day One: Wednesday</strong></h3>



<p>7:30 a.m. — I wake up slightly earlier than usual since I have a meeting at 9 a.m. on the dot, and we are in office most days now. I take my morning probiotic and drink a cup of water: I have a sensitive stomach and find taking probiotics and eating a healthy, mostly non-processed diet helps. Afterwards, I start getting ready: Too Faced mascara, Anastasia brow gel, NARS tinted moisturizer/sunscreen, Charlotte Tilbury bronzer, and Merit blush balm. I keep this routine to 10 minutes max. I pack some pre-made boiled eggs, my za’atar chicken and rice pilaf lunch (which was the leftovers from last night’s dinner) and take the subway to work (which is covered by my prepaid transit card).</p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — On the way, one of my friends texts in a group chat about a trip coming up. We are all going to France for a wedding, and then planning a day trip to a vineyard afterwards. We each owe $47 for the bus round-trip. I venmo her since she will pay in Euros for all of us. <strong>$47</strong></p>



<p>9 a.m. — I peel my eggs and make Earl Grey tea at work (I stopped drinking coffee during the pandemic). I also take some fiber gummies my mom sent me (she sends me a lot of vitamins and supplements).</p>



<p>12:30 p.m — Work is mainly uneventful, as it’s quiet during the summer. I eat the lunch I bought. There were visitors for a meeting, and they had leftover pasties, so I also have a mini croissant as my dessert. I hardly ever eat sweets, but I’ve been good at eating healthy and cooking almost all my meals lately, so I allow myself this treat.</p>



<p>5:15 p.m. — I leave the office a bit early and head to the gym. There are massive train delays due to the rain so it takes me nearly an hour to get to my home station, near where the gym is. </p>



<p>7 p.m. — On the way home from the gym, I stop in at the Walgreens next door, since I am out of toner. I buy Thayer’s Witch’s Hazel ($14.99) and some cotton balls ($4). It’s amazing how much things are inflated — the same toner was always $9.99 before COVID-19!! <strong>$19.24</strong></p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — I quickly down an Oath Nutrition Clear Whey protein shake in Frosty Lemonade and start dinner. I make a soup with shrimp, mushrooms, and tomatoes, using Maesri Thai Tom Yum Soup paste. I love to cook and hate spending money on eating out unless it’s with friends or for a special occasion. I read a lot of cooking blogs and have found Maesri to be one of the most cheap and authentic Thai brands. The soup is yummy, and my partner A. and I eat two-thirds of it for dinner. I have a work lunch tomorrow, so the leftovers will be A.’s lunch. Afterwards, we relax and watch <em>Sorry, Baby</em>. A. is a big cinephile and pays for all our streaming subscriptions and any movie rentals. Before we dated, I only had Netflix and watched everything on my laptop. He was quite horrified by this and now we have a 75-inch screen tv and a Sonos surround-sound system.</p>



<p>10:30 p.m. — I walk the dog and prepare for bed. Double-cleanse with Aprilskin cleansing balm, Eminence daily exfoliating cleanser, Thayer’s toner, Glow Recipe blackberry retinol, and Farmacy honey halo moisturizer. This is a bit early for me, but I’m tired and fall asleep quickly!</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $66.24</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Two: Thursday</strong></h3>



<p>6:30 a.m. — I wake up early for some reason, maybe because I did go to bed early. I lay in bed for nearly an hour and then get up. I take my probiotic and go through my makeup routine. Today for breakfast, I pack a Chobani 2% mango Greek yogurt since I’ve eaten hard-boiled eggs three days in a row now. I do love my eggs though!</p>



<p>9 a.m — Arrive at work and it’s another quiet day. We were three days a week for a long time and just went up to four days. A lot of people are really unhappy about this, especially as not everyone is following the mandate. </p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — Head to my work lunch. It’s at a trendy steakhouse and the vendors I’m meeting order a bunch of apps to share. I go with a butter salad salad with grilled steak as my main since I indulge a bit on the apps. They pay.</p>



<p>7 p.m. — Home and thinking about what to eat as we are mostly out of groceries. A. says he is meeting up with the boys at a new taco spot. I’m invited but he warns me it’s a boys night. I decide a quiet night by myself sounds much more appealing. I make a Costco salmon burger we had in the freezer and alternate between reading <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> and playing with my dog until bedtime.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $0</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Three: Friday</strong></h3>



<p>8:30 a.m. — I sleep in because I’m WFH today! I didn’t used to sleep so much but ever since COVID-19, I became a deep sleeper and must get at least seven or eight hours every night. I lay in bed since I don’t really have a morning routine during WFH. I chat with A. about needing to go on our weekly grocery run today or this weekend. He is not enthused. I know I will need to wait until he is hungry to bring it up again.</p>



<p>9:30 a.m. — It’s payday, so I make a $500 payment to my credit card that has the highest interest rate (I also paid $1,500 the last payday, aggressively trying to pay this down). The rest I will need for rent next week and extra cash coming up for my trip next month. I check on some work emails but it’s mostly quiet. We have summer Fridays so around 1 p.m. I start logging off. <strong>$500</strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — Since we skipped breakfast this morning due to sleeping in, I decide to make us a big brunch. I make bacon, Birch Benders vegan protein pancakes, fried eggs, and leftover sourdough I got from the farmers’ market last week.</p>



<p>4 p.m — I suggest taking the dog to the park to enjoy the nice day (the last couple of days were rainy). I am also trying to up my step count to hit 10,000 a day because I keep hearing it’s an underrated way to get fit. We walk to the park and decide to make it a longer walk and end up going to Greenpoint to try their fabulous restaurant scene. Neither of us are super hungry so we get happy hour drinks first. We stop by a Mexican restaurant that has bar stools outside on a lively street. I get a rosé and my boyfriend gets a beer. He pays (I am not a big drinker so he tends to pay for my drinks).</p>



<p>7 p.m. — The restaurant next to us has outdoor diners eating an amazing-looking panzanella salad. We go for it and it’s delicious. I get a filet mignon with side salad for my main and he gets a pesto pasta with lamb ragu. We also both get Guinness — it’s so rare to see this on a menu outside of Irish pubs! We discuss going on a day trip upstate tomorrow to take advantage of the nice weather all weekend. <strong>$72.50</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $572.50</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Four: Saturday</strong></h3>



<p>8:30 a.m. — Apparently my body likes routine: I could not sleep in until 9 a.m. A. is still asleep so I take the dog out for his morning walk. I make some bacon and eggs because I want to save our appetite for when we are upstate.</p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — After a bit of a slow start, we head out to Grand Central to catch an 11:55 a.m. train to Cold Spring. We get there early so we can grab seats. <strong>$15.25</strong></p>



<p>1:17 p.m. — Arrive in Cold Spring. It’s late and we still need to eat lunch, so we do a short loop that is right on the river and has a small outlook trail. A. wants oysters so we go to a quaint seafood restaurant with outdoor seating and river views. We share oysters and I also get two glasses of rosé and a seafood pasta. A. gets two beers, gazpacho, and a big bowl of mussels. It’s cash only, so he goes to the ATM. (The meal was $80. We’ll split the expenses later, as we have a shared tracker.)</p>



<p>3:45 p.m. — We walk around the small downtown and shop at the local boutiques. We go to a candle shop (I love candles), but A. decides he wants to buy a diffuser to have a nice scent 24/7. I buy a stitching crochet kit with a funny message. <strong>$19.51</strong></p>



<p>5:00 p.m. — We still have 30 minutes until we have to catch the train home, so we find a wine bar and have a quick drink. He gets a beer and I get an orange wine. I put down my card since he paid for lunch. <strong>$16.82</strong></p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — Buy train tickets quickly on the app and catch the train back to the city! <strong>$15.25</strong></p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — Back in the city and we have dinner plans to catch up with a friend. We drop the dog off at home and meet her at a Michelin-starred Vietnamese restaurant. I am still so full from lunch so I just order an appetizer and a salad, while A. orders a huge plate. I have one glass of wine while they both have two drinks. My friend and I didn’t eat much, so we pay a bit then A. covers most of the bill. <strong>$48</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $114.83</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Five: Sunday</strong></h3>



<p>8:30 a.m. — Feeling slightly hungover from the couple of drinks I had yesterday, and not sleeping quite enough. We lounge in bed for a couple more hours and finally get up to make breakfast before grocery shopping. We go to a specialty shop nearby to get fresh Shewolf bakery bread and also pick up some ’nduja (Italian spreadable salami) and boquerones (Spanish anchovies) to snack on later. A. makes poached eggs to go with the bread and the nduja. <strong>$23</strong></p>



<p>1 p.m. — Weekly Trader Joe’s run. We get two bouquets of flowers, jasmine rice, tofu, cut butternut squash, green beans, cilantro, parsley, tomatoes, shredded carrot, edamame, avocado oil, arugula, lemons, limes, chicken breasts, tuna, olives, tea, oat creamer, oven roasted turkey, white cheddar corn puffs, frozen shrimp rolls, and frozen chicken wontons. <strong>$77.65</strong></p>



<p>2:00 p.m. — When we get home I realized I forgot canned coconut milk. I go to a nearby grocery store and pick up a can, as well as a couple of Chobani and Fage 2% Greek yogurts. I hate fat-free yogurt and also don’t want full-fat, so these are a happy medium. I don’t bother adding this to our shared expense sheet since it’s not much. <strong>$10.37</strong></p>



<p>4 p.m. — I had made an appointment to get a haircut at a Chinatown salon that I saw on TikTok that does $40 haircuts which includes a nice head/scalp massage. I am skeptical but I have naturally straight hair and I just need a trim, so I figure they can’t mess it up that bad. The head massage was more like a scalp scratching, not relaxing at all. But the haircut is pretty decent! I get a good trim and some face-framing layers. I like my hair stylist and her English is good. I tip $10. <strong>$50</strong></p>



<p>6 p.m. — Home and time to make dinner. I make a Thai red curry with the groceries we got today and a can of curry paste I had. It’s delicious and our leftovers will be lunch tomorrow. We watch some random movie and pass out early.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $161.02</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Six: Monday</strong></h3>



<p>8:30 a.m — Morning routine and head to the subway. Because we were three days in office for a long time, I only opted to load $50 per month on my prepaid transit card this year. This lasts me half the month, so I just end up paying with my card the rest of the time. <strong>$2.90</strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — Eat my leftovers lunch and go for a 30-minute walk to help with digestion and get steps in.</p>



<p>3:30 p.m — Browse the Abercrombie sale online as I am thinking about getting some barrel pants for the fall. I add four things to my cart to meet the $100 free shipping minimum and plan on returning most things to the store. I do have quite the shopping problem (hence the credit card debt), so I decide to think about it overnight and wait until tomorrow to order.</p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — Leave work and go to the gym. Tap credit card to pay for the metro card. <strong>$2.90</strong></p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — Dinner is tom yum fried rice with the leftover paste I had from last week. It’s an open package so I’m trying to use it up. Fairly tasty, but not much different than Thai fried rice I’ve made and had before. Packed the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $5.80</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Seven: Tuesday</strong></h3>



<p>8:30 a.m. — Morning routine and head to subway, another tap to pay. <strong>$2.90</strong></p>



<p>10:30 a.m. — I see items in my Abercrombie cart have an extra 15% off. That’s a sign, right? I spend $160 but plan on only keeping one thing and returning the rest. <strong>$160</strong></p>



<p>3 p.m. — My coworker remarks how she needs more work clothes now that we are in the office more days. We browse Uniqlo’s JW Anderson collab and decide to make a quick run to the Uniqlo store across the street from us to check it out. I end up buying a boxy Oxford, straight-leg jeans, and a bra tank top that was on sale. All great basics that I’m super excited about. <strong>$90</strong></p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — Leave work and go to the gym. Tap to pay again. <strong>$2.90</strong></p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — Spend the rest of the evening trying on outfits and starting to plan for our trip soon! </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $255.80</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>“I went out to eat more than usual this weekend, because we went upstate. I didn’t realize how much I would spend if I ate out all weekend, even with breakfast at home! I think I will be more conscious that this can’t happen every weekend, as I’m trying very hard to pay down my debt.”</p>
