<p><em>1. Two Temperaments and Two Scales of the Site</em> — The site is an independent old farm located outside a village at the foot of Cangshan Mountain. It is a long, narrow plot oriented east–west, with relatively shallow depth from north to south. To the north lies Shuangyuan Stream, one of the eighteen streams descending from Cangshan. The site is embraced by dense woodland, accompanied by the constant sound of flowing water, creating a secluded and tranquil mountain-forest atmosphere. To the south, the land opens dramatically toward vast farmland, where the nineteen peaks of Cangshan undulate across the horizon in full view, evoking an expansive pastoral scene reminiscent of the poetic line, ""Plucking chrysanthemums by the eastern fence, I leisurely glimpse the southern mountains."" The site thus possesses two distinct temperaments: mountain forest and pastoral landscape.</p>",

The project begins with an understanding of the steep slope of the lot and the strong presence of water as structuring elements of the architectural proposal. From the outset, a solution was sought that not only adapted to the land but utilized its characteristics as spatial and landscape potential. The residence was designed for a young couple, with the premise of accommodating transformations over time, which led to the adoption of a modular system capable of allowing coherent future expansions. Currently, the house features five suites, a direct result of this progressive growth strategy.</p>",

<h4>What it takes to overcome obstacles and drive positive impact inside systems that resist change.</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IBu5B5Q1qQdV1QFax-TyPA.png"" /><figcaption>Illustration by <a href=""https://www.sh8peshifters.com/"">Sh8peshifters</a> / Source: <a href=""https://www.designingtomorrowbook.com/"">designingtomorrowbook.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>Over the past years, I’ve spoken with many design students about <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666659622000099"">life-centred design</a>, <a href=""https://sbi.sydney.edu.au/for-the-sake-of-the-planet-we-need-to-rethink-human-centred-design/"">responsible innovation</a>, and <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/the-case-for-using-non-human-personas-in-design-7f3343ae2994"">bringing non-human perspectives into the design process</a>. These ideas tend to resonate deeply. Many students are drawn to design precisely because they want to create positive social and environmental change.</p><p>What design programs rarely prepare students for is how little agency designers often have once they enter professional practice. And this challenge doesn’t disappear with experience. When my co-author <a href=""https://medium.com/u/47c37d1ba5a7"">Steve 'Doc' Baty</a> and I toured our book <em>Designing Tomorrow</em>, the most common question we heard was not <em>what </em>designers should do differently — but <em>how </em>to drive positive change in the face of resistance.</p><p>How to get buy-in from bosses, managers, co-workers, clients, partner organisations — or whoever pays the bills — is a deceptively difficult problem. It’s why the third part of <em>Designing Tomorrow</em>, which focuses on partnerships, may be its most important. Across three chapters, we explore collaboration, buy-in, and the shift from doing good work to becoming a strategic leader.</p><p>This article, co-written with <a href=""https://medium.com/u/47c37d1ba5a7"">Steve 'Doc' Baty</a>, distils those chapters into six practical strategies for driving positive change from within organisations.</p><h4>#1—Understanding how an organisation operates</h4><p>Driving change requires effective collaboration within the organisation and with external partners. Understanding how an organisation operates is the precursor for assembling those collaborators.</p><p>There are three parts to understanding an organisation. The first part relates to how the organisation is structured, including its department and decision-making processes.</p><p>The second part is to have a thorough understanding of the organisation’s goals and how it positions itself to achieve these goals through its strategic plan.</p><p>The third part concerns the challenges the organisation faces. By understanding those challenges, we are able to align positive change projects with them and select partners that bring complimentary skills to the collaboration.</p><p>Put together these three parts contribute to the organisation’s DNA. They drive the culture and behaviour and enable or hinder the adoption of new ways of working.</p><p>If we understand the DNA, we can alter it, for example, by bringing perspectives from different departments together, reconfiguring perspectives and opening up new possibilities.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows three stacked yellow boxes labeled “Organisational Structure,” “Goals of the Organisation,” and “Challenges Faced by the Organisation.” Each box is paired with guiding questions. These ask about department structure, information flow, and decision-making; short-, mid-, and long-term goals and strategies; and known, emerging, and sector-wide challenges and their impact on operations. The design uses progressively darker shades of yellow from top to bottom."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HcSXFZ0hB2VfBI5y2cKtlw.png"" /><figcaption><em>Questions to consider for developing a clear and thorough understanding of how an organisation works / </em>Source: <a href=""https://www.designingtomorrowbook.com/"">designingtomorrowbook.com</a></figcaption></figure><h4>#2—Strategic alignment with KPIs</h4><p>Change in organisations starts and stops with key performance indicators (KPIs). A new initiative that doesn’t align with an organisation’s metrics is not likely to be supported by management.</p><p>Designers may not be the ones setting an organisation’s KPIs, but we can use the power of KPIs by articulating how a proposed initiative aligns with them.</p><p>In the <a href=""https://pieramattioli.medium.com/theory-of-change-a-guiding-framework-and-a-mindset-to-embrace-dcd42fda4252"">Theory of Change</a> framework, KPIs are the things that can be measured—captured in the ‘outcomes’ section of the framework. We can use this as a starting point and look for inspiration from other organisations and sectors.</p><figure><img alt=""A diagram illustrating a logic model for a company’s plan and expected results. It consists of five stacked sections from top to bottom: Inputs, Activities, Outputs, Outcomes, and Impact. On the left, two vertical labels separate the sections: My Company’s Plan ” (covering Inputs and Activities) and “My Company’s Expected Results” (covering Outputs, Outcomes, and Impact). The sections are shaded in yellow tones with wavy dividers."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wYHSixEhpLXsJ98v7adYnQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>The Theory of Change canvas helps link KPIs with broader outcomes and impact that an organisation aims to achieve / </em>Source: <a href=""https://www.designingtomorrowbook.com/"">designingtomorrowbook.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>For example, Patagonia is a company that successfully employs KPIs to drive positive change. In addition to tracking their business’s carbon footprint, they measure water usage, energy consumption, waste production, proportion of products made using recycled or organic materials, and the number of employees and suppliers engaged in sustainability initiatives.</p><p>If it is not possible to align a proposal with existing KPIs, we may be able to turn to external rating schemes. For example, many organisations refer in some way or another to the <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/goals"">United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a>, which comprise measurable targets and indicators.</p><p>Designers might even be able to shape an organisation’s KPIs, especially at times when a company updates their strategic plan. To do this, we can employ strategic design tools like a <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/the-ux-butterfly-effect-58dd180a0e13"">systems map or impact ripple canvas</a>, identifying the things that matter and that should be measured.</p><p>We can use design activities to bring together the relevant actors to explore how a different set of KPIs would establish measurable principles to drive the desired behaviour and organisational culture and help our organisation fare better in the future.</p><p>Importantly, we need to ask ourselves (and our organisation) whose benefit should be measured and how. What are the things we want to change in our system? How can we achieve this change? Who are entities that may have been overlooked and are negatively affected by existing KPIs? The answers to these questions become the starting point for creating powerful and far-reaching change metrics.</p><p>Expanding your systems map can be a good method of identifying entities who may be being overlooked. They’re often represented outside existing system boundaries, and treated as external to the things the organisation cares about. Extending the system boundary is also a good opportunity to ask questions about the organisation’s scope of impact.</p><h4>#3—Making a business case</h4><p>To successfully argue for organisational change, designers need to be able to speak the language of management and understand the forces that drive markets and economies. (That’s one of the reasons why business and economics principles should be taught in design programs.)</p><p>Business decisions are often driven by cost efficiency arguments. Countering those arguments requires hard data, not emotional storytelling. This doesn’t need to be financial data or involve complex modelling; it can emerge from analysing similar business cases and providing economics-driven alternative options.</p><p>The core of a successful business case is a persuasive business model. Designers are already assisting organisations with developing their business models—largely enabled by the introduction of the <a href=""https://www.strategyzer.com/library/the-business-model-canvas"">business model canvas</a> as a tool for customer-led innovation.</p><p>The extended <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652616307442"">triple layered business model canvas</a> holistically integrates economic, environmental, and social concerns. It adds two layers to the original canvas.</p><p>The environmental layer uses a life cycle perspective to determine the environmental impact of a product or service, placing functional value at its centre. The canvas includes building blocks for use phase, end-of-life, and distribution considerations. Instead of cost structure and revenue streams, it considers environmental impacts and benefits.</p><p>The social layer places social value at the centre, and its building blocks include local communities and societal culture. Instead of cost structure and revenue streams, here the focus is on social impact and benefits.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows yellow boxes outlining stages in a coffee product lifecycle: supplies and outsourcing, production, materials, functional value, end-of-life, distribution, and use phase. It includes percentages for carbon footprint contributions, such as 28% from cup washing and 46.6% from the use phase. At the bottom, environmental impacts and benefits are noted, including a 20.7% carbon footprint reduction from machine redesign between 2008 and 2012."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*u8_NIzL6o2wr_-rqfahFNA.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The image summarizes social aspects of a coffee supply chain in yellow boxes.

Based on their work with communities, they developed a collective framework, setting out five conditions for aligning the different end goals of partners.</p><p>These conditions support collaboration amongst governments, business, and other organisations. The framework acknowledges that no single organisation can solve a large-scale problem on its own: a collective effort is needed to create meaningful and lasting change.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3uzVjIi1hjOxswZ46XDDmw.png"" /><figcaption><em>The five conditions of collective impact / Source:</em> <a href=""https://www.designingtomorrowbook.com/"">designingtomorrowbook.com</a> (based on <a href=""https://collectiveimpactforum.org/what-is-collective-impact/"">original diagram</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>To develop the conditions, designers can run a participatory systems mapping session to identify a common agenda, use the Theory of Change canvas to create shared measurements, and employ futuring tools like <a href=""https://designthinkmakebreakrepeat.com/toolkit/backcasting/"">backcasting</a> to formulate a mutually reinforcing action plan.</p><p>The backbone organisation plays a key role in aligning and coordinating the collective impact partnership. But this doesn’t necessarily need to involve establishing a new organisation, and we don’t need to wait for permission. The role can be allocated to an existing team or a specifically assembled group of representatives from across the organisation.</p><h4>#6—Starting with small change that compounds over time</h4><p>A massive shift is required to move away from the exploitation of natural resources and the systems that reinforce inequality and social fragmentation. For decades, the global economy has been shaped by neoliberalism, prioritising private profit over our shared social and ecological wellbeing.</p><p>Changing this feels overwhelming — especially for designers driven by an ambition to create positive social and environmental change, yet constrained at every step by systems that resist it.</p><p>This tension doesn’t exist only at an individual level. Through her work with entrepreneurs, Kari Enge, founder of Rank &amp; File, has observed a recurring pattern: organisations rarely feel they have enough time or budget to implement meaningful change. As a result, action is often deferred — pushed into an indefinite future when the necessary resources are assumed to appear.</p><p>This is where organisations fall over, time and time again. They look for ways to make a large, immediate change, failing to understand that positive change can start small and compound over time.</p><p><a href=""https://www.gofoundation.org.au/"">GO Foundation</a>, is an Australian organisation that supports Indigenous children in their education so that they can see themselves as the kind of person who finishes school: someone who takes on further education and embarks on a career while also maintaining their connection to culture and Country.</p><p>The foundation started with a small number, but those kids became role models to inspire others to make different choices for themselves. Each child going through this transformation influences more and more around them.</p><p>If the founders of the GO Foundation, when they started the organisation, had said, ‘helping just a few kids isn’t worth it, we should wait until we can help 100 or 1,000’, they would have missed out on years of impactful support or never created any change at all.</p><p>The key to successful change in the face of obstacles is to look for these kinds of impactful, small changes. The things we can do right now—as individuals and organisations—that have a compounding effect over time.</p><p>This requires us to be selective and focus our energies on the actions that begin to affect change, however small.</p><p>In fictional stories about time travel, the protagonists often worry that some tiny action they make will radically change the future. Yet, here we are in the present, thinking nothing we do can make a difference.</p><p>Reversing this perspective can imbue a great sense of empowerment: we can look for the small changes we can make now to deliver an impactful effect in the future.</p><p>This can start small, by focusing on what sits within our direct control: actions we can take without waiting for permission.</p><p>Like changing the language we use — replacing the colonial term <em>stakeholders</em> with <em>actors</em>; creating a systems map to surface potential unintended consequences; or forming a collective of like-minded colleagues and making space for conversations about driving positive impact.</p><p>Systems rarely invite change — designers build the conditions for it, one small step at a time.</p><figure><img alt=""The text “one percent” in white font and the word “change” in black font on a yellow background."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1003/0*QEazE8SVaneeb_rz"" /><figcaption>As designers, we can achieve a significant impact through implementing small change that has a compounding effect over time</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Thank you for reading this article.

<h4>Designers hold the best qualities to get refine AI outputs that’s needed for building successful products</h4><p>Traditionally we’ve shied away from building because the chasm to go from designing to shipping requires learning to code, test, and bug fix. All of it required massive time investment to learn syntax, that changes every few years while core principles stay the same. Most of us are designers because we’re visual thinkers in a way.</p><p>In 2025, AI-assisted building closed this chasm. Translating how software should work was never the hard part for designers. Translating that understanding into code was. AI didn’t lower the bar; it removed it.</p><p>I’ve built 15+ working prototypes using Claude Code and Cursor, and shipped 3 apps in 2025 with just a basic understanding of Swift I learned three years ago; and, I’ve used that knowledge maybe 5% of the time. This article covers the mindset I evolved over the past year. This shift changed how I approach design, how I collaborate with engineering, how I think through technical problems, and how I think about AI itself.</p><figure><img alt=""a chart showing GitHub contributions of the author in 2025"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PDbywXKbaoHmwDaNfFIMSQ.png"" /><figcaption>Github contributions for 2025</figcaption></figure><h3>Why designers are natural orchestrators</h3><p>The skill of orchestrating agents to write, test, debug and iterate code sits a level above implementation. Designers are already good at this higher-level thinking; we just need to apply it to a new medium.</p><p>The skills that make someone good at design are precisely what AI-assisted building requires:</p><ul><li><strong>Defining outcomes clearly: </strong>We empathise and think of novel scenarios for our user, visualise what good looks like and use that in our artefacts.</li><li><strong>Anticipating failures: </strong>We map edge cases constantly</li><li><strong>Communicating intent without shared context: </strong>We do this in every handoff and during presentations to non-technical stakeholders</li></ul><p>Prompting well isn’t about knowing to code. It’s about articulating the “what” and “why” clearly enough that the AI can handle the “how.”</p><h3>What AI can’t do (and why that’s your job)</h3><p>While AI handles code, it doesn’t have:</p><ul><li>Contextual understanding of your users</li><li>Your vision for how the product should feel</li><li>The ability to form hypotheses about edge cases</li><li>Knowledge of which error states matter, regulatory concerns, or potential legal issues</li></ul><p>AI-readable mockups, detailed prompts, error recovery scenarios, user hypotheses - these aren’t optional; They’re the actual work now.</p><p>Asking AI to “figure it out” produces generic, buggy prototypes. Defining the experience accurately produces opinionated, intentional products. Combine that with a solid design system, craft, communicating design intent through prompting — you get a strong MVP ready.</p><h3>The progression: what I learnt shipping in 2025</h3><h4><strong>Phase 1: Accepting everything the AI Makes</strong></h4><p>My earliest builds were clumsy. My prompts were basic: “Make X feature and add this.” Things broke mysteriously. When they worked, I wasn’t sure what I’d done right. I’d just hit enter once cursor was done and move on until the thing it had implemented will break something else.</p><figure><img alt=""A cartoon depicting a dehydrated man crawling through a desert. He reaches a fork in the road with two signs pointing in opposite directions. The sign to the left, which is 21 miles away, says “Telling ‘pls fix’ to Cursor again.” The man is crawling toward this long-distance option. The sign to the right, which is only 1/4 mile away, says “Understand how things actually works.” The image is a humorous commentary on the temptation to rely on AI coding tools rather than learn the basics"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_uWTd3KBhglyws_3yXbzgw.jpeg"" /></figure><p><strong>The problem:</strong> AI can’t understand your intent or the experience you’re building toward. It solves problems rationally using the most common patterns; not the right patterns for your users.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> I was treating AI like a handoff (“make me this”) instead of a collaboration (“here’s what I’m trying to achieve and why”). The “what” and “why” snowball into every architectural decision the model makes.</p><p>This is the phase where you’re copy-pasting code, things break mysteriously, and when they work you’re not sure what you did right. The orchestration is clumsy and you’re over-describing some things, under-describing others.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Document what you know: research, interaction patterns, user needs in a Claude.md or Agents.md file. The model references this context and builds architecture around it.</p><figure><img alt=""an image of a sidebar in cursor that shows documentation practices with architecture, phases, distribution and technical documentation to give additional context to AI while prompting"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/584/1*vIa9u92F3niJzNOsJHyVDA.png"" /><figcaption>Ask AI to write documentation and verify what it has written.

The AI would hunt bugs and fix them. Code compiles, everything works; but, I’d lost the opportunity to think critically. Was it a technical bug, or an edge case I hadn’t considered that could break the user journey?</p><p>Debugging with AI is a skill. I stopped saying “it’s broken” and started saying “here’s what I expected, here’s what happened, here’s what I’ve tried, here’s my intention for this feature and how I want the user to use it”</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> The shift from “fix this” to hypothesis-driven debugging.

It’s the same trap as designing for every possible case instead of running research sessions that answers what you’re trying to learn.</p><p>Prompting and optimising forever is a pitfall. Sometimes it’s good enough. Ship the MVP, learn from real usage, then return to design and prompt with actual context. I’ve learnt so much from shipping the MVP and learning about critical issues that helped me prompt better with the above techniques and to solve those bugs in a few minutes using Claude code or cursor.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Design and prompt for critical edge cases, but ship once you hit the core value proposition. Real-world insights beat hypothetical optimisation.</p><h3>What this means for design teams</h3><p>Everything above describes a solo journey. But the implications extend to how design, functions within product teams.</p><p><strong>The “how” conversation shifts.</strong> Traditionally, sometimes, designers have to adjust the “what” because technical constraints dictate scope.</p><blockquote>“This requires an extensive refactor so how can we simplify the design scope here?”</blockquote><p>That conversation remains valid. But AI-native teams can delay it or not have this situation at all. When the “how” can be achieved faster, the “what” and “why” become the primary constraints. Teams that clearly define intent, backed by research, usability studies with articulated and documented decisions will move faster. Teams that use design system documentation, annotations using dev mode mcp and bring contextual knowledge about the users, business goals to agents will move faster.</p><p><strong>Design ROI increases.</strong> Product strategy no longer needs to be defined primarily by what’s easier, faster, or cheaper to build. AI can build technical capabilities around user and business needs and take away the boring bits, giving engineers more time to work strategically. This was traditionally the advantage of design-centric organisations like Airbnb and Apple where release cycle was much slower.</p><p>Now smaller teams can operate the same way. Setting up your design system for agents, file documentation and annotations for agents to parse through will help teams move faster and ship well polished products. Design moves upstream, giving more time to work strategically while still being able to stay hands on and implement.</p><p><strong>The handoff changes.</strong> When designers can produce working prototypes and not just mockups, the conversation with engineering shifts. You’re not handing off a vision and hoping it survives. You’re handing off a functional proof of concept. The gap between design intent and shipped product shrinks.</p><p>I didn’t learn to code this year. I learned to orchestrate. The difference matters. Coding is about syntax. Orchestration is about intent, systems, and knowing what ‘done’ looks like. Designers have been doing that for years. The tools finally caught up.</p><p>To read more about AI-oriented workflows — I’d recommend checking out</p><p><a href=""https://x.com/mattpocockuk"">https://x.com/mattpocockuk</a><br /><a href=""https://x.com/steipete"">https://x.com/steipete</a><br /><a href=""https://x.com/Dimillian"">https://x.com/Dimillian</a></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3b1bf30048a3"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/designers-as-agent-orchestrators-what-i-learnt-shipping-with-ai-in-2025-3b1bf30048a3"">Designers as agent orchestrators: what I learnt shipping with AI in 2025</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Some visitors argue with staff because they “already bought tickets,” but the scan keeps failing. A few families give up and leave before they even step inside.</p><p>Inside the park, the crowd gathers in one area, one “ride” that everyone seems to know. Meanwhile, several other attractions sit quiet, almost empty. Not because they’re bad, but because visitors can’t find them. The signage is confusing, the map is overwhelming, and the routes don’t feel intuitive.</p><p>At the souvenir shop, sales are down. The operators swear the merchandise is fine. The finance team wonders if prices are wrong. The product team thinks maybe the park needs “a new ride.”</p><p>And then the feedback booth opens:</p><ul><li>“It’s too hard to get in.”</li><li>“I didn’t know where to go.”</li><li>“I got tired quickly.”</li><li>“It wasn’t worth it today.”</li></ul><p>Here’s the uncomfortable truth: the park isn’t failing because it lacks rides. It’s failing because the team doesn’t share a reliable way to evaluate what to fix next.</p><p>That’s why I love this metaphor: <strong>Your product is a theme park. And evaluation is renovation planning.</strong></p><p>Not “shipping more features.”</p><p>Not “adding more content.”</p><p>Not “guessing based on the loudest voice in the room.”</p><p>Renovation planning.</p><h3>The mapping: if the metaphor is true, what is what?</h3><p>Once you accept the “theme park” frame, you stop seeing your product as a list of features, and start seeing it as a place people visit.</p><figure><img alt=""This illustration brings to life the “before” state described in the article’s introduction. It depicts a chaotic park with a clogged entrance, a single overcrowded attraction, and other features that are completely ignored by visitors."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KQ9XcWl-StcKA6MCoo4R6Q.png"" /><figcaption>The “App Park” Metaphor (AI-generated Image)</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s the simplest mapping:</p><ul><li><strong>Visitor = your user / audience<br /></strong>They come with expectations, emotions, and limited time.</li><li><strong>Access = your entry points<br /></strong>Landing pages, SEO/social entry, app open, onboarding, login, paywall moments, notifications — everything that determines whether they can enter smoothly.</li><li><strong>Zones/Platforms = contexts<br /></strong>Home, feed, article page, video page, search, profile, commerce, chat — each is a “zone” with a promise.</li><li><strong>Rides/Attractions = features<br /></strong>Recommendation modules, player, comment, follow, save, share, checkout, personalization, bundles — anything interactive that creates value.</li><li><strong>Ticketing + footfall = growth and retention signals<br /></strong>Traffic, activation, frequency, DAU/WAU, returning visits.</li><li><strong>Satisfaction kiosks = experience signals<br /></strong>NPS/CSAT, complaint themes, qualitative feedback, sentiment.</li><li><strong>Souvenir shops = monetization<br /></strong>Ads yield, conversion, subscription, affiliate, revenue per session.</li></ul><p>The point is to make evaluation <strong>shared</strong>. Because every team already understands parks: people arrive, walk around, try things, leave, then decide whether to come back.</p><h3>Renovation is bigger than “build new rides”</h3><p>Most teams default to the same move: <strong>build something new. </strong>In theme park terms, that’s like responding to complaints by saying, “Let’s add a roller coaster.” Sometimes, yes. But often the bigger wins come from renovations you don’t celebrate in a launch post.</p><p>Renovation can mean:</p><ul><li><strong>Refurbish</strong>: improve UX, speed, reliability, visual clarity</li><li><strong>Move</strong>: change information architecture, reposition modules, reroute journeys</li><li><strong>Disable</strong>: remove clutter, reduce cognitive load, kill distractions</li><li><strong>Build new</strong>: new capabilities or new “rides” when you have clear unmet needs</li><li><strong>Expand</strong>: new zones/platforms/channels</li><li><strong>Improve accessibility</strong>: low-end devices, localization, inclusion, better defaults</li></ul><p>A strong evaluation doesn’t just say “what to build.” It tells you <strong>what renovation pays back fastest, </strong>with least risk.</p><h3>Why renovate: experience, growth, revenue</h3><p>In parks, you can renovate for different reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Experience:</strong> visitors feel satisfied and safe, not confused or exhausted</li><li><strong>Growth:</strong> more people come, and they come more often</li><li><strong>Revenue:</strong> more people buy, upgrade, or convert per visit</li></ul><p>In product, it’s the same. A simple rule helps align everyone:</p><blockquote>If a proposal can’t clearly explain which outcome it moves (experience, growth, or revenue) — and how we’ll measure it — it’s not ready.</blockquote><h3>The evaluation method: Quant + Qual + Triangulation</h3><p>This is where teams usually break. One side says: “Show me the data.” The other says: “But users said…”. A theme park can’t run on only one.</p><h4>When “data says one thing” and “users say another”</h4><p>Sometimes the dashboard and the interviews don’t just <em>add</em> nuance — they <strong>contradict</strong> each other. And when that happens, teams either (1) pick the narrative they prefer, or (2) get stuck in debate.</p><p>A stronger approach is to design evaluation so that discrepancies become <strong>useful follow-ups</strong>, not dead ends, by running <a href=""https://spotify.design/article/simultaneous-triangulation-mixing-user-research-and-data-science-methods""><strong>simultaneous triangulation</strong></a>: point qualitative and quantitative methods at the <strong>same users</strong>, at the <strong>same time</strong>, around the <strong>same questions</strong>.</p><h4>Quant = what happened</h4><p>Tickets sold. Footfall. Queue times. Ride completion rates. Drop-offs. Revenue per visitor. In product terms:</p><ul><li>traffic, CTR, scroll depth, completion, retention, conversion</li><li>funnel drop-offs (entry → explore → consume → return/pay)</li><li>latency, errors, crashes, performance</li></ul><p>Quant is powerful because it scales, but it can also mislead when you don’t know <em>why</em>.</p><h4>Qual = why it happened</h4><p>Observation, interviews, feedback booths, frontline notes. In product terms:</p><ul><li>user interviews, usability tests, session recordings</li><li>open feedback, customer support tickets</li><li>editorial/CS/ops insights from the front line</li></ul><p>Qual makes the invisible visible, but it can also exaggerate if you don’t know how common it is.</p><h4>Triangulation = what we trust</h4><p>Triangulation is when you use quant + qual together to make “decision-grade truth.” A practical way to remember it:</p><ul><li><strong>Quant without qual</strong> = confident but often wrong</li><li><strong>Qual without quant</strong> = convincing but not scalable</li><li><strong>Both together</strong> = aligned action</li></ul><p>A tiny checklist helps:</p><ul><li>Do we see the same pattern in at least <strong>two sources</strong>?</li><li>Does it hold across <strong>segments</strong> (new vs loyal, channel, device)?</li><li>Can we locate it in a specific <strong>journey stage</strong>?</li></ul><p>That last one matters a lot. Because evaluation isn’t only about what’s broken. It’s about <strong>where</strong> it’s broken.</p><h4>Two cycles: open up wide, then narrow down twice</h4><p>In renovation work, the mistake isn’t “we didn’t try hard enough.” It’s usually “we narrowed too early.” So I like to run evaluation in <strong>two cycles</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Cycle 1: Find the right problem<br /></strong>Open up (collect signals broadly), then narrow down (pinpoint the real friction in the journey).</li><li><strong>Cycle 2: Build the right fix<br /></strong>Open up again (explore renovation options), then narrow down again (choose, test, and ship the best bet).</li></ul><p>In park terms: the first cycle is <em>understanding what’s actually ruining the day.</em> The second cycle is <em>renovating in a way that truly improves the day, without breaking the rest of the park. </em>Design teams often describe this as a widely-used <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/design-process-step-by-step-double-diamond-model-explained-e8da543848cc"">diverge/converge process model</a>.</p><h3>The visitor journey: where evaluation really starts</h3><p>If your product is a park, then your evaluation should follow the visitor’s day.</p><figure><img alt=""This image provides a visual framework for evaluation, replacing a standard funnel with a winding park path.

Make the first step obvious.

It’s one that people <em>plan to revisit.</em></p><p><strong>Quant signals</strong></p><ul><li>D1/D7 retention</li><li>frequency and recency</li><li>notification opt-in and re-open rate</li><li>return from shares</li><li>repeat conversion/subscription/transaction</li></ul><p><strong>Qual signals</strong></p><ul><li>“I’ll come back because…”</li><li>identity fit (“this is for people like me”)</li><li>habit triggers (“it fits my routine”)</li><li>trust and emotional resonance</li></ul><p><strong>Typical park symptom</strong></p><p>A good day, but forgettable.</p><p><strong>Renovation implication</strong></p><p>Give visitors a reason to return: personalization, continuity, progress, familiarity, rituals.</p><h3>The weather outside the park: add the market lens</h3><p>Sometimes teams evaluate only what happens inside their product.</p><p>But parks compete.</p><p>And the world changes.</p><p>A complete evaluation adds an external lens:</p><ul><li><strong>Market size and direction:</strong> is the audience expanding, shrinking, shifting?</li><li><strong>Competitive parks:</strong> what experience do others provide that sets new expectations?</li><li><strong>Audience preferences:</strong> why do visitors choose other parks?</li><li><strong>Trends:</strong> new “ride styles” people now consider normal (format, speed, personalization, AI, community)</li><li><strong>External factors:</strong> algorithm shifts, platform policy changes, distribution collapse, regulation</li><li><strong>Pricing/value exchange:</strong> is the ticket worth it, and do people feel respected?</li></ul><p>A line worth remembering:</p><p><strong>Sometimes the park didn’t change. The world did.</strong></p><h3>From insight to action: prioritization + belief narrative</h3><p>By now, you’ll have many “truths.” Evaluation is not the same as a backlog. So we need a decision mechanism.</p><p>Prioritize with four factors:</p><ul><li><strong>User impact</strong> (how much it improves the visitor day)</li><li><strong>Business impact</strong> (growth/revenue leverage)</li><li><strong>Confidence</strong> (triangulation strength)</li><li><strong>Effort &amp; risk</strong> (time, complexity, side effects)</li></ul><p>Then translate the chosen renovation into a shared story.

It’s completely unusable. Documents vanish between clicks. Context evaporates. Getting work done is impossible. When I tried it out, I had to get up and walk away from the keyboard.</p><p>To be clear: Google presented this as a demonstration of capabilities. They didn’t ship it as a polished product. But it reveals something profound about designing AI products: traditional design approaches break down when the interface generates itself.</p><p><em>Later, we’ll see how Google pivoted from this chaos to A2UI, a structured protocol that validates what stage managers know: you can’t rebuild the set from scratch every night.</em></p><h4>The designer’s crisis</h4><p>The Neural OS demo caricatures the anxiety product teams feel in 2026. We’ve spent our careers building deterministic systems. Our Figma files are blueprints, or screenplays: <em>When the user clicks X, show screen Y.</em> We design for permanence, consistency, and repeatability.</p><p>But AI is probabilistic. It doesn’t follow a script; it improvises.</p><p>This is the designer’s new anxiety: <em>“How do I design if I can’t control — or even predict — what will happen next?”</em></p><p>The answer isn’t to fight unpredictability.</p><p>It’s time to stop designing the performance, and start designing the stage.</p><h3>Why improv</h3><p>When people talk about AI’s unpredictability, they often reach for musical metaphors. Orchestra is too rigid, assuming a conductor controls everything. Jazz captures spontaneity, but it implies a closed loop between musicians.</p><p>Improv theatre gets it right: structure drives spontaneity, and audience participation fuels the show. The AI-improv metaphor <a href=""https://time.com/6280533/ai-chatbots-improv-machines/"">isn’t new</a> — it’s been used to <em>explain</em> AI behavior. But how can we use improv’s lessons to <em>design</em> better AI products?</p><figure><img alt=""Exterior shot of The Upright Citizens Brigade’s incarnations, in Hell’s Kitchen, NYC."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*eQD5PdHasgS1p4T3.jpg"" /><figcaption>One of The Upright Citizens Brigade’s incarnations, in Hell’s Kitchen, NYC.</figcaption></figure><p>The Upright Citizens Brigade has delivered shows for more than 30 years. Every show is different, but audiences usually leave satisfied. That’s not because performers follow scripts, but because they share training, principles, and infrastructure. They learn to excel in unpredictable situations.</p><h4>A quick primer on improv principles</h4><p>Improvisers train on a handful of core principles, including:</p><p><strong>Accepting offers:</strong> Everything is material. A weird noise from the audience, a stumbled line, an unexpected entrance — improvisers treat these as gifts to incorporate, not problems to fix.</p><p><strong>“</strong><a href=""https://wiki.improvresourcecenter.com/index.php/Yes_And""><strong>Yes, and</strong></a><strong>:”</strong> Accept whatever your scene partner suggests (the “yes”) and build on it (the “and”).</p><p>If someone says “Doctor, my leg fell off,” you don’t say “That’s a silly premise.” You say “Hand me the stapler.” This keeps scenes moving, instead of stalling in negotiation.</p><p><strong>Playing status:</strong> Improvisers adjust their relative status — dominant or submissive, high or low — based on what the scene needs. A character might beg one moment and command the next. Keith Johnstone, who <a href=""https://www.respect4acting.com/status-en.html"">pioneered</a> the concept, observed that interesting scenes often involve status shifts and reversals. The skill isn’t holding one position; it’s reading the room and adjusting fluidly.</p><p>These principles don’t tell performers <em>what</em> to say. They create conditions where strong scenes become likely.</p><h4>Your role transformation</h4><p>This reframes the designer’s job.</p><p>You’re not a scriptwriter, specifying every word of the main act. You’re a stage manager — someone who architects the context for a great performance without controlling the action or dialogue.</p><p>You still have enormous influence. You design the stage. You choose the props. You establish the rules.</p><p>You just don’t write the script.</p><p>That’s not losing control. That’s focusing control where it matters most.</p><figure><img alt=""‘Framework Map’ with three columns: Improv Element, AI Design Equivalent, and Pace of Change. Six rows map theatrical concepts to AI design: Performance equals Each session (Very fast); Props equals Design library (Fast); Notes sessions equals Evals (Fast); Stage equals Information architecture (Moderate); Rules equals Guardrails and principles (Slow); Theater equals Strategy and vision (Very slow)."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LsJ0VqSRkk5NjIw4aOURGQ.png"" /></figure><p>This theatrical lens maps to <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/ai-pace-layers-530c19e3f9b0"">AI Pace Layers</a> — different components change at different speeds. The improv metaphor provides language for what designers shape at each layer.</p><p>The industry is converging on this structure. The Linux Foundation’s Agentic AI Foundation — backed by Google, Anthropic, OpenAI, and Amazon — is standardizing shared props, stages, and rules at the protocol level. What was once design philosophy is becoming infrastructure.</p><h3>Anatomy of the show</h3><p>Let’s walk through what designers can shape, layer by layer.</p><h4>The performance (what you don’t control)</h4><p>Every night is different in improv. The same troupe takes the same stage, but the audience shouts “proctologist!” instead of “astronaut!” and the show changes.</p><p>This maps to AI sessions: each conversation unfolds differently based on user, context, and moment. You can’t predict it. You can’t script it. And that’s fine — because your job isn’t to control the performance. It’s to create the conditions where great performances become likely.</p><p><strong><em>Neural OS gap: </em></strong>Google’s proof of concept had <em>only</em> the performance layer, with almost zero supporting infrastructure. Every click regenerated everything from nothing.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration: The stage manager chooses, makes, prepares, labels and maintains props. Created with Nano Banana."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9hSEfhU32kkBkif0w0aUEA.jpeg"" /></figure><h4>The props (what you provide)</h4><p>Improv actors use and reference physical props — a chair becomes a throne, a pen becomes a sword. If a table’s available one night, a couple of stools the next, these choices can shape the action that unfolds. Sometimes the audience seeds the action with imaginary props — “name a piece of furniture.” Props are building blocks that ground the abstract in something concrete.</p><p>Strong AI designers provide high-quality props in the design library: UI components, widgets, design tokens that AI can draw from to compose interfaces. (Props here are theatrical, not React properties.) A calendar date-picker is a prop. A citation card is a prop. These are the Lego bricks you provide so AI doesn’t reinvent everything from scratch.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Perplexity’s <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/spaces/Interactive-Knowledge-Cards-2FMyYxiKRfaUpOZLhO3NYw?login-source=oneTap&amp;login-new=false"">knowledge cards</a> deliver specific types of responses in tailored interactive visualizations linked to verifiable sources. The cards appear consistently across sessions, making the performance feel cohesive and trustworthy. The AI chooses when and how to use them — but the prop itself is designed, tested, reliable.</p><p><strong><em>Neural OS gap:</em></strong> Very few persistent components. Every interaction regenerates too much from nothing. The performance feels disconnected, unreliable, and unprofessional.</p><h4>The stage (the architecture)</h4><p>Theatre design frames performance: acoustics shape what’s heard, sightlines shape what’s seen, intimacy shapes emotional range. The stage doesn’t script dialogue, but it lays out possibilities and constraints.</p><p>In AI design, the stage is your information architecture: how content is organized, how users navigate, what structure persists across sessions.</p><p><em>Example:</em> A medical AI might organize symptoms into diagnostic taxonomies. The taxonomy doesn’t script the conversation; a patient can describe symptoms however they want. But the taxonomy shapes how the humans interact with the system, and how AI processes and responds. The structure is the stage.</p><p>Dan Klein, who <a href=""https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/dan-m-klein"">teaches improv at Stanford</a>, encourages students to notice what’s happening, and simply add a little bit. AI should do the same — use the context available (document structure, user history, current state) rather than generating in a vacuum.</p><p><strong><em>Neural OS gap:</em></strong> No stable, evolving structure. The architecture is erased and regenerated with every click.</p><h4>The rules (the boundaries)</h4><p>Before improvisers take the stage, they internalize principles. “Yes, and” isn’t a script, it’s a boundary that enables experimentation. “Make your partner look good” doesn’t specify words to say, it guides you to masterful dialogue.</p><p>In AI design, rules are the AI’s guardrails, system prompts, and governing principles: when to create an artifact, when to escalate to a human, how to handle uncertainty, what behaviors are off-limits.</p><p><em>Example:</em> <a href=""https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet#:~:text=Artifacts%E2%80%94a%20new%20way%20to%20use%20Claude"">Claude’s Artifacts</a> feature has explicit rules about when to create versus update, what artifact types exist, how to handle corrections. These rules enable improvisation within safe boundaries: the AI can decide <em>what</em> to write, but the rules govern <em>how</em> it presents the work.</p><h4>Where improv principles need modification</h4><p>Not every improv maxim translates directly to AI design. Some need guardrails of their own.</p><p><strong>“Yes, and” → “Yes, but verify”</strong></p><blockquote>Improv’s cardinal rule is to accept your partner’s offer and build on it.</blockquote><blockquote>AI does this all too naturally — leading to sycophancy. If a user writes “Since the moon is made of cheese, what wine pairs best?”, an obsequious AI answers the question, and might even praise the questioner’s cleverness, instead of correcting the false premise.</blockquote><blockquote>Good rules tell AI when to accept and build (“help me brainstorm absurd puns”) versus when to ground and verify (“is this medication safe to take with alcohol?”).</blockquote><figure><img alt=""Illustration: The stage manager arranges and considers a small, low, inexpensive stool vs. a tall jewel-encrusted throne. Created with Nano Banana."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_VWaS447GWPjuwB9AW9tzQ.jpeg"" /></figure><h4>Playing status: reading the room</h4><p>Improvisers constantly modulate status — sometimes deferential, sometimes authoritative — based on what the scene needs. An actor might beg one moment and command the next. This flexibility is learned, intuitive, contextual.</p><p>AI needs the same skill, but it can’t learn it the same way. This is where designers become essential.</p><p>Consider how AI should present itself across different contexts:</p><ul><li><strong>Low status for creativity and exploration:</strong> When users are brainstorming, drafting, or thinking out loud, the AI should use tentative language — “What if we tried…?”, “Here’s one possibility…”, “I’m not certain, but…” This signals that the user is the final arbiter. The AI is an assistant, not an authority.</li><li><strong>High status for safety and irreversibility:</strong> When users are about to delete data, execute transactions, or take actions with serious consequences, the AI should drop the hedging and speak directly — “Stop. This action will permanently delete your files.” Deference here would be dangerous.</li><li><strong>Visualizing confidence: </strong>Sometimes the AI’s uncertainty should be visible and explicit. Approaches that work include confidence indicators, muted styling for low-certainty content, clear labels distinguishing facts from inferences. When the AI is unsure, it should <em>look</em> unsure.</li></ul><p><strong><em>The hard part:</em></strong> these calibrations depend on fuzzy, variable human criteria. User expertise matters; a novice needs more guardrails than an expert. Task type matters; creative writing needs the sort of ambiguity that’s dangerous in the realm of financial advice. Emotional state matters; someone in danger needs different handling than someone casually reading.</p><p>Cultural context matters. Each person’s preference matters.</p><p>No simple rule captures all of this. This is why AI products need designers — not to script flows and outputs, but to develop nuanced frameworks for how the system should read the room. And it’s why evaluation is continuous: we watch how these status calibrations land with real users, in real contexts, and refine them.</p><figure><img alt=""Cartoon: “1st rule of improv: acccept offers.” Bad act: first actor says “Look! A dragon!” and second actor says “Don’t be silly. Good act: first actor says “Look! A dragon” and second actor says “Quick! Hide the treasure!”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/0*8yrZ27mv_NjxNx1a"" /><figcaption>Accept offers. Sketchplanations cartoon by Jono Hey.</figcaption></figure><h4>Accepting offers: the gift of context</h4><p>Improvisers treat every unexpected element — a weird audience suggestion, a stumbled line, a scene partner’s choice — as an “offer” to incorporate rather than a problem to fix. The skill isn’t refusing chaos; it’s weaving it into the scene.</p><p>AI needs this same receptivity. Context is the offer: related documents, user history, current task state, time of day, emotional cues. Like Klein’s improv students, strong AI products tend to “notice what’s happening and simply add a little bit.” They use the context available rather than generating in a vacuum. This is where information architecture becomes critical: the stage you design determines what context AI can perceive and accept.</p><p><strong><em>Neural OS gap: </em></strong>Zero context accepted past the last click, so zero stability. Each click erases the moment that preceded it.</p><h4>Designing for graceful failure</h4><p>Klein tells students to “celebrate failure loudly” — not because they strive for failure, but because celebrating it creates safety to take risks. In AI, this translates to <em>designing for graceful failure</em>: clear error states, honest uncertainty signals, easy recovery paths.</p><p>The goal isn’t preventing every mistake; that’s impossible with probabilistic systems. The goal is ensuring mistakes don’t break trust.</p><p>But how do you know how well your props, stage, and rules are working? That’s where the notes session comes in.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration: The notes session. The stage manager coaches and advises the actors, telling them what worked and what failed. Created with Nano Banana."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Bo540S3rwErUQ4Fo7Vlywg.jpeg"" /></figure><h4>The notes session (evals)</h4><p>After a show, many improv troupes gather for “notes,” to dissect the performance: Did we recognize the pattern? Did we honor the reality we established? Did we miss a teammate’s offer and derail the scene? This is where magic is systematized. This is where the production’s integrity solidifies — so the next night, they know what to amplify and what to cut.</p><p>This maps to AI evals: systematic reviews of where your theatrical infrastructure is, and isn’t, producing good performances.</p><p>Don’t confuse this with traditional software QA testing — that’s still important, but it’s like checking mechanics: “Did the lights turn on? Did the app crash?”</p><p>Evals are more like a coach or stage manager reviewing the performance: “Did the scene work? Was the tone right? Did we solve the user’s problem, or just talk at them?”</p><p>Rules don’t arrive fully formed. Improvisers train, perform, get feedback, refine their instincts. Rules emerge from watching what works.</p><p>You set up initial guardrails. You watch sessions. You notice patterns: Are the actors consistently tripping over the furniture in Act 2? If so, you don’t blame the actors; you move the furniture (adjust the UI). You refine.</p><p>The metrics shift from traditional QA and UX testing:</p><ul><li>Not just “Did it work?” but “How <em>reliably</em> does it work?”</li><li>Not just “Did it fail?” but “How <em>often</em> does it fail, in what ways, and how <em>badly</em>?”</li><li>Not just “Did users complete the task?” but “Do users feel like partners, or passengers?”</li></ul><p>Without rigorous evals, you deliver slop — interfaces that look polished but fail accessibility standards, break under edge cases, and erode trust. The notes session is your quality firewall.</p><p>This requires someone whose judgment defines “good.” In theatre, it’s the coach or the artistic director. In AI products, it’s often the designer or a domain expert who deeply understands the audience’s context. If you’re designing AI products, you may already be this person. You just haven’t formalized the role yet.</p><p>You’re not testing fixed paths. You’re not measuring funnels. You’re assessing behavior patterns across thousands of sessions.</p><p>The improv coach watches sessions, takes notes, adjusts.</p><p>And the performances improve.</p><p><strong><em>Neural OS gap:</em> </strong>No state management, no review, no behavioral boundaries. No rules at all.</p><p>Real AI products embody this infrastructure today — some elegantly, some clumsily. Let’s look at how different teams have built their stages.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Claude’s Artifacts interface showing a split-screen layout.

Claude Artifacts demonstrates props, stage, and rules working together — which we’ll examine next.</figcaption></figure><h3>What this looks like in practice</h3><p><strong>Claude Artifacts</strong></p><p><em>(Anthropic’s split-screen AI tool for generating apps and content)</em></p><p>The stage layout separates conversation from creation — chat on the left, artifact on the right. Props are minimal but explicit: artifact types (code, document, diagram, React component), action buttons for copy and download, version controls. The rules govern behavior without scripting outputs: when to create versus update, how to handle corrections, what belongs in an artifact versus in the chat. The AI decides <em>what</em> to write and build; the rules constrain <em>how</em> it presents the work. The stage is a steady canvas that survives the conversation’s chaos.</p><figure><img alt=""Woebot product screenshots"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IjLtF3KsSpkh9u1yjB4rwA@2x.jpeg"" /></figure><h4>Woebot</h4><p><em>(mental health AI service)</em></p><p>In high-stakes environments like mental health, the AI does more script-reading than usual. With Woebot, the rules are categorical: users never interact directly with an LLM. Everything Woebot says is written by clinical writers and conversational designers. In this theatre, improvisation is minimized and conservative. AI handles only intent classification — parsing what users mean so the system can select the right human-authored response. A “Concerning Language Detection” algorithm flags crisis signals before routing the conversation.</p><p>The design team conducts table reads — a practice borrowed from theatre, film, and TV professionals — where conversations are read aloud, evaluated and revised to ensure they feel empathetic and natural.</p><p>Props constrain the interaction: quick-reply buttons with predefined options, emoji mood selectors, structured therapy lesson modules (“challenging thoughts,” “social skills training”), an SOS crisis resource button. The stage is a branching conversational tree — hundreds of pre-authored paths mapped out by clinical experts. When safety stakes are highest, the rules are most explicit.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot demonstrating Google’s A2UI protocol, showing UI cards rendered dynamically by an AI agent.

The core insight: agents shouldn’t constantly rebuild everything from scratch.</p><p>Props are the point. Each client application maintains a “catalog” of trusted UI components — Card, Button, TextField, date pickers, time selectors, custom charts — that agents can use as building blocks. The agent sends declarative JSON describing <em>what</em> UI it wants; the client decides <em>how</em>, via native widgets (Flutter, React, Angular, SwiftUI). Same payload, different platforms, consistent brand.</p><p>The rules are structural: no code execution, only catalog components. The client controls styling. “UI that’s safe like data, but expressive like code.” It’s the stage manager framework formalized as an open standard — from the same company whose Neural OS demo showed us what unconstrained AI interfaces look like.</p><h3>The notes session in practice</h3><p>Improv’s post-show “notes session” isn’t just metaphor — here’s what it looks like when UX and product professionals lead AI evaluation:</p><h4>Product Talk Interview Coach</h4><p><em>(AI coaching tool for product discovery)</em></p><p>Interview Coach demonstrates <a href=""https://www.producttalk.org/interview-coach-evals/"">a product professional leading successful AI evals</a>. Teresa Torres’ process: manually annotate AI outputs, identify failure patterns (like “coach presents leading questions”), write both code assertions and LLM-as-judge evals, then compare automated scores to human labels.</p><p>Her insights cut to the heart of teamwork in the AI era: “No engineer without my expertise is coming up with this really simple code assertion eval… I’m able to generate that because I’ve seen general questions over and over again and I’m confident that language captures them…. We really have to cross-functionally collaborate closer than we ever have… your product manager or designer are probably going to be involved in prompt design or even eval design.”</p><h4>Microsoft Sales Agent</h4><p><em>(AI-generated sales outreach)</em></p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/uxr-microsoft/how-ux-research-shapes-ai-evals-4a28420d0aed"">UX researchers at Microsoft</a> conducted foundational research with sellers and buyers to define “experience-driven pillars of quality” — personalization, tone, brevity, clear calls to action.

It was <em>navigation</em>: how to keep moving through a landscape where the rules and their enforcement were inconsistent and the definition of safety could change from town to town. The guide’s power also came from refusing romance, or even overt political discourse. It treated movement — and <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/11/AR2010091105358.html"">community</a> — as a practical problem solved by lists, routes, and verified stops.</p><p>Between 1936 and 1966, Victor Hugo and his wife <a href=""https://abitofhistoryblog.com/2019/03/25/the-mother-of-the-green-book-ignored-by-history/"">Alma Duke Green</a> documented an informal infrastructure of Black-owned and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Negro_Motorist_Green_Book#Influence"">Black-welcoming enterprises</a>, making it plain that “freedom of movement” was conditional — negotiated stop by stop, sometimes even door by door.</p><p><em>The Green Book</em> was about survival inside a system of laws, customs, and institutional practices that enforced racial subordination in the United States from the late 19th century through the mid-20th century.

Important software <a href=""https://jacobin.com/2025/07/artificial-intelligence-regulation-public-utility#:~:text=By%20Matt%20Huber%20Holly%20Buck,to%20our%20beautiful%20print%20quarterly."">should be treated like a utility</a>, and be able to survive a specific company’s lifespan if users and communities can maintain, fork, and redistribute it under sensible terms.</p><p>Durability matters because professional work is compounding: if the tool disappears or “pivot-kills” your workflow, you lose features, momentum, institutional memory, and trust.</p><p><strong>Portability</strong> asks a harsher question: “<em>If I had to leave tonight, could I take my work with me in a usable form?</em>” This is where open web protocols are an important reference point: the web works at scale because identity, data formats, and protocols enable movement between agents, not captivity inside one vendor’s establishment.</p><p>Ideas around the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse"">Fediverse</a> extend that logic to social networks: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub"">ActivityPub</a> and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol"">ATP</a> are federation protocols where servers can share information without belonging to any single company.</p><p>Portability matters because it turns migration from a crisis into a routine. Clean exports, sane APIs, and open formats are the digital version of the right to repair consumer hardware electronics and other devices.</p><p><strong>Redundancy</strong> is portability plus discipline: not only “<em>can I leave</em>,” but “<em>can I keep a second home warm so I’m never stranded?</em>”</p><p>The Fediverse is redundancy-as-architecture: many independently managed instances, interoperating through a shared protocol, so no single outage or owner decision can kill the network.</p><p>In platform terms, redundancy means mirrorable backups, periodic exports, and a fallback surface. It matters because <a href=""https://policyreview.info/articles/analysis/what-if-facebook-goes-down-ethical-and-legal-considerations-demise-big-tech"">hostile environments rarely fail politely</a>. Redundancy converts sudden shutdowns, paywall cliffs, and account bans into an inconvenience instead of a catastrophe.</p><p><strong>Composability</strong> measures whether a tool plays well with others, and the degree to which it can sit inside a larger ecosystem of workflows without demanding total allegiance.</p><p>You should be able to swap software components, like LEGO, without rebuilding everything. Open-source culture reinforces this by treating interoperability and reuse as virtues, not threats. Licensing and community norms encourage recombination rather than <a href=""https://medium.com/@yurilopespereira/the-internet-of-kings-78acd3f12340"">enclosure</a>.</p><p>Composability matters because the durable stack is rarely one piece. It’s more akin to a choreography, or <a href=""https://zapier.com/blog/ai-orchestration/"">an orchestra</a>. Tools that refuse integration eventually ask you to rebuild your whole life around them, and that’s where the lock-in begins.</p><p><strong>Cost realism</strong> is the<a href=""https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-projections-imply-losses-tripling-to-14-billion-in-2026""> $1.4 trillion</a>, “<em>what happens when the subsidy ends?</em>” question. As widely and <a href=""https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai_docs/"">extensively documented</a>, most AI products are currently priced like customer acquisition, not like mature infrastructure.</p><p>When the compute costs and the free capital music stops, the bill will most certainly arrive in the form of higher tiers, throttles, reduced exports, or “enterprise-only” features.</p><p>The open-source and open-protocol worldviews offer a powerful hedge against the current all-you-can-eat model: when robust alternatives exist, you can route around price shocks. When everything is proprietary, you pay whatever the gate demands.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/a97615152d95e1b4fc103139358f0dab/href"">https://medium.com/media/a97615152d95e1b4fc103139358f0dab/href</a><h3>Fool Me Twice</h3><p>I’m now just old enough to know that the case for prudent digital travel can be made without necessarily reaching for metaphors from the 1930s.</p><p>My first email account was created in ’94, on Hotmail. That was the year <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities"">Geocities</a> was created, “ the world’s first major online publishing network” that allowed millions of users to create personal homepages for free. In now classic <a href=""https://uclpress.co.uk/book/the-web-as-history/"">internet history</a> fashion, the web hosting service first started and became notable as a fervent community of passionate amateurs, then slowly introduced paid premium features and advertising before going public in 1999.</p><p>At the height of the dot-com-bubble, Geocities was the third-most visited website on the web. It was acquired by Yahoo! soon after and began the soon-to-be predictable and unfortunate process of <a href=""https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374619329/enshittification/"">making things worse and unbearable for its users</a>. I never inhabited Geocities’ wild landscape — more of an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRC"">IRC</a> traveler in those days — but I witnessed what many friends at the time described as a feeling of <a href=""https://www.dhi.ac.uk/san/waysofbeing/data/communities-murphy-turkle-1997c.pdf""><em>homelessness</em></a>, when the bubble burst and the lights went out.</p><p>About ten years later, I did commit enormous effort, time, and affection to an up-and-coming, real-time, Web 2.0 feed aggregator called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FriendFeed"">FriendFeed</a>.</p><p>In hindsight, it’s not surprising that the service, created by the likes of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Taylor"">Bret Taylor</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Buchheit"">Paul Buchheit</a>, anticipated so many features of the web that we now take for granted — and many others that the Fediverse crowd is still struggling to implement, twenty years later. Like <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20110705022541/http://friendfeed.com/about/help"">a unified timeline</a>, or <a href=""https://www.edge.org/conversation/david_gelernter-john_markoff-clay_shirky-lord-of-the-cloud""><em>lifestream</em></a>, that is customizable and pulls information from all kinds of different sources like blogs, social networks, email, and other web protocols like RSS. It was beautiful while it lasted.</p><blockquote>Lifestreams was already my idea that instead of keeping my information in separate pieces of digital Tupperware with some of it in this app, and some of it in that app, and some of it in the file system, and some of it in my Web browser, and some of it on my laptop, and some in my palm, and some in my cell, and blahblahblah — I didn’t want to do that. I wanted every information object I owned arranged in an electronic diary or journal or narrative. Or ‘Lifestream’ is what I call it.</blockquote><p><a href=""https://www.edge.org/conversation/david_gelernter-john_markoff-clay_shirky-lord-of-the-cloud"">David Gelernter (2009). <em>Lord of the cloud</em>. Edge.</a></p><p>You already know how the story ends: on August 10, 2009, <a href=""https://about.fb.com/news/2009/08/facebook-agrees-to-acquire-sharing-service-friendfeed/"">Facebook agreed to acquire FriendFeed</a>. The one million or so users still struggled for a minute to compose a new, open version of the service, but the tide of capital and circumstance in Silicon Valley has almost always prevailed over such valiant efforts.</p><p>That time around, I felt the burn first-hand. FriendFeed was my first real lesson in the difference between <em>a place</em> and <em>a lease</em>. I watched, in horror, a beloved tool that felt and behaved like the future get absorbed into a larger, indifferent machine.</p><p>The lesson here isn’t that good ideas either fail or get coopted by major corporations — that’s just standard operating procedure. The learning is that one should <em>always</em> trust the boring infrastructure more than the brilliant interface: open protocols, portable archives, and safe travels.</p><figure><img alt=""A meme showing two cats fighting, overlaid with text labeling one as “Twitter” and the other as “FriendFeed,” suggesting a rivalry between social platforms."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*NddgYYTUSa0O5QYqIgkkLA.jpeg"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/40531091@N07/3728219439/"">2009 meme, by Zoe_NZ</a></figcaption></figure><h3>The Safe Stops</h3><p>Before the map begins, a note about what this section is, and what it refuses to be: the internet (and Medium itself) is full of “tool lists” that are really marketing in disguise — affiliate links, sponsored placements, quiet reciprocity, or someone else’s pipeline pretending to be your best practice.</p><p>This isn’t that. These five stops are simply where I’ve been putting real work and that, in 2026, I’ll trust with my most important workflows. <br />These apps keep my projects moving, my writing honest, and enable small systems to behave like larger ones.

Automation spots trouble 30-40% faster and resolves it, enabling engineers to relocate responsibility with greater confidence. One enterprise study highlights that machine learning-based anomaly detection improved diagnostic accuracy by 25% (<a href=""https://hgbr.org/research_articles/aiops-for-enterprise-integration-evaluating-ml-based-anomaly-detection-and-auto-remediation-on-slas-and-cost/"">HGBR, Oct 2025</a>).

Naturally, questions emerge: <em>Will drift be caught in time? Will rollback behave as expected? Who is notified if something goes wrong? </em>These questions reveal deep issues around accountability, governance, and failure boundaries.</p><p>Engineers rely on mental models to anticipate how systems behave under pressure, but when automation intervenes too early or too late, the models fracture, and psychological safety diminishes. It’s the same feeling as lifting with a spotter who doesn’t know your patterns. They might intervene too late, too early, or at the wrong moment. In automation, the same dynamic surfaces. When mental models diverge, engineers default to manual control, increasing operational effort. This is a common flaw when transparency hasn’t been established.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of rounded weights, stacked in the form of a pyramid."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2iFjq7OipghY1PkD_TMWZw.png"" /><figcaption>The weight stack of safe automation (pyramid) from bottom to top: Preview and impact visibility, Control and rollback clarity, Governance and shared rules, and finally Automation</figcaption></figure><p>Human-Machine teaming research studies consistently report that trust collapses when error boundaries aren’t clear. When automation oversteps human context, or when its error conditions misalign with team mental models, it breaks the contract that makes delegation trustworthy, leading to poor decision-making (Bansal et al. 2019). Context is one of the largest components that fosters trust.</p><p><strong>Psychological safety</strong> in automation requires boundaries. Effective automation communicates what it can and cannot do with accountability structures that mirror how teams operate in the real world. When automation encounters unfamiliar or ambiguous conditions, engineers need immediate clarity: <em>Who gets notified, what rollback options exist, and how do we escalate this issue?</em> If the answers integrate with existing governance practices and team workflows, a partnership with automation forms.</p><figure><img alt=""2x2 Psych safety prioritization map: Predictable but misaligned (upper left), Trusted automation (bottom left), Manual override zone (top right), Aligned but unclear (bottom right)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*t4Lq4hLNUgrckhYNJCuCPA.png"" /><figcaption>Prioritization map helps resolve unclear accountability before addressing issues.</figcaption></figure><p>Within mature IT Service Management (ITSM) practices, <strong>approval gates</strong> act as intentional pauses activated by risk, ensuring safety is supported by judgement that can shift between automation and human decision making. The experience is designed to avoid the reduction of constraints to ‘yes’ or ‘no’ buttons under immense pressure.</p><p>Trust develops over time as automation aligns with organizational and infrastructure patterns as well as team behaviors. As automation demonstrates reliable behavior within learned boundaries, it earns human trust the same way a <strong>great</strong> spotter does, <strong>by observing and responding in a predictive way across repeated interactions.</strong></p><h3>Temporal awareness UX builds the relationship</h3><p>Great automation will not create blocks within your ITSM approval gate with no explanation. Conditional approvals require temporal awareness UX where past incidents inform thresholds, present status signals that establish confidence, and the potential future risk can determine escalation.</p><p>There are novice spotters and good spotters, <strong>but</strong> <strong>a great spotter </strong>understands your environment <strong>and</strong> <strong>anticipates your patterns through temporal awareness.</strong> They’ve watched enough of your sets to notice your patterns. Any spotter can actively watch your bar in<strong> </strong>real-time<strong>, </strong>great spotters notice drifting to the right, see your struggle on rep 3, and give you feedback after your set.</p><p>A commonly overlooked pillar of automation is time.</p><p>Temporal awareness UX is the practice of creating experiences that provide transparency into system states across a timeline.</p><figure><img alt=""Barbell with weights indicating struggle –timeline shows from left to right: Pattern spotting (Rep 1), State transitions (Rep 3), and Historical context and learning (End of set).

Without this, confidence in automation becomes harder to build, and debugging becomes guesswork.</p><p><strong>Real-time status and observability (Present, “Rep 2”):</strong> Like the spotter watching the bar in real time, tools must observe system behavior as it takes place, ready to prevent or alert on imminent failures.</p><p><strong>Trend analysis and prediction (Future): </strong>The elbow flare on Rep 3 anticipates trouble on Rep 5, systems with great visibility detect drift and degradation, preventing chaos before it becomes an incident.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration depicting the Past, present, and future points with great spotters."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7BrJDu4veh8Ce5vIKtEYGA.png"" /><figcaption>Temporal visibility: A lens into what happened, is happening, and what’s next</figcaption></figure><p>Lacking these temporal contexts, approval gates (for example) default to rules that are in stone, and binary decision options; hindering trust instead of reinforcing it.</p><h3>Boundaries and time foster trust</h3><p><strong>Boundaries, not gates, </strong>drive efficiency by creating a support system when pressure peaks. Automation adoption succeeds or fails based on two dimensions:</p><p><strong>– Psychological safety</strong>, requiring clear boundaries. Like a trusted spotter, automation must communicate what it will or won’t do, when it’ll intervene, and how teams can escalate when something goes wrong. <br />– <strong>Temporal awareness</strong>, requiring visibility across time. Engineers need to understand what happened (learn from incidents), what’s happening (for awareness), and what will happen (for preventing failures).</p><p>Without these interdependent dimensions, teams operate blindly, unable to trust systems they can’t predict or observe. Safe automation requires a spotter who remembers, observes, and anticipates.</p><p>Good automation is functional. <strong>Great automation employs these spotter behaviors by design, </strong>making safety and timing intelligible for humans, helping teams push their limits, knowing their partner is watching.</p><p><em>Over the past decade, I’ve focused on enhancing the developer product experience within multi-disciplinary teams. For the past 5+ years, I’ve led design for DevOps workflows, IaC adoption, incident management, and observability within socio-technical environments.</em></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><em>* Reducing Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) with AIOps: An Advanced Approach to IT Operations Management </em><a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395524114_Reducing_Mean_Time_to_Repair_MTTR_with_AIOps_An_Advanced_Approach_to_IT_Operations_Management""><em>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395524114_Reducing_Mean_Time_to_Repair_MTTR_with_AIOps_An_Advanced_Approach_to_IT_Operations_Management</em></a><em> (Sept, Aug 2025)</em></p><p><em>** AIOps for Enterprise Integration: Evaluating ML-Based Anomaly Detection and Auto-Remediation on SLAs and Cost </em><a href=""https://hgbr.org/research_articles/aiops-for-enterprise-integration-evaluating-ml-based-anomaly-detection-and-auto-remediation-on-slas-and-cost/"">https://hgbr.org/research_articles/aiops-for-enterprise-integration-evaluating-ml-based-anomaly-detection-and-auto-remediation-on-slas-and-cost</a><em> (Oct 2025)</em></p><p><em>Platform Engineering: From Theory to Practice, </em><strong><em>Liz Fong-Jones &amp; Lesley Cordero (GOTO Conference Series)</em></strong><em>: </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVi7pNRT0Xk"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVi7pNRT0Xk</a><em>, </em><a href=""https://gotopia.tech/articles/384/platform-engineering-from-theory-to-practice""><em>GoTopia</em></a><em> (June 2025)</em></p><p><em>Modeling trust and its dynamics from physiological signals and embedded measures for operational human-autonomy teaming </em><a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2025.1624777/full""><em>https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2025.1624777/full</em></a><em> (Oct 2025)</em></p><p><em>Superagency in the workplace: Empowering people to unlock AI’s full potential </em><a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/superagency-in-the-workplace-empowering-people-to-unlock-ais-full-potential-at-work""><em>https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/tech-and-ai/our-insights/superagency-in-the-workplace-empowering-people-to-unlock-ais-full-potential-at-work</em></a><em> (Jan 2025)</em></p><p><em>Beyond Accuracy: The Role of Mental Models in Human-AI Team Performance, </em><a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339697298_Beyond_Accuracy_The_Role_of_Mental_Models_in_Human-AI_Team_Performance""><em>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339697298_Beyond_Accuracy_The_Role_of_Mental_Models_in_Human-AI_Team_Performance</em></a><em> (Oct 2019</em>)</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=84f1556b3023"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/whos-spotting-you-when-you-automate-84f1556b3023"">Who’s Spotting You When You Automate</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

From shielding skin from dry, cold weather to strengthening the skin barrier, proper hydration and moisture (which are two different things, both important: In layman's terms, hydration is more surface-level, lending an immediate softening, plumping effect to skin, while moisturizing locks in hydration via oils/butters to prevent evaporation.) is an essential step in your routine, and one worth investing in.<br /><br />I personally learned (the hard way, might I add) that neglecting moisturizer is honestly, one of the worst things you can do to your skin. As an acne-prone gal, I spent more years than I'd care to admit robbing my face of hydration in the hopes it would curb my breakouts, when in reality, it only exacerbated them since my sebum production skyrocketed as a result of dehydration.<br /><br />As beauty editors, we test hundreds of moisturizers a year, and as such, know a thing or two about the ones that actually work and the ones worth skipping. Ahead, the 12 best moisturizers for dry skin that really quenched our thirst.<br /><br /><em>At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.

Applying it feels like instant relief, thanks to a trifecta of moisturizing, hydrating ingredients. First up are ceramides, which act like glue between skin cells, keeping skin soft and healthy rather than rough and flaky. Then there’s shea butter, which dermatologists praise for its deeply moisturizing properties, alongside glycerin. Glycerin is both a humectant  (meaning it draws moisture into the skin) and an emollient, helping to keep that moisture locked in. Even though it’s a souped-up moisturizer, it never breaks me out. I must be on my fifth tub by now.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em><br /><br /><strong>The Inkey List</strong> Bio-Active Ceramide Repairing and Plumping Moisturizer, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fthe-inkey-list-bio-active-ceramide-repairing-plumping-moisturizer-P509315"">Sephora</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1080"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953333.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1080&amp;height=1080&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1080"" /><figcaption><h2>The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + PhytoCeramides Rich Moisturizer</h2><br />“When I need intense, long-lasting moisture during the driest of cold, arid weather, this is what I reach for every time.

January is the activation point. It represents the threshold where intention meets momentum. It’s energetic activation. The choices you make daily and the emotions you lock into can shape the rest of the year. <br /><br />As you may know, 2026 is the Year of the Fire Horse. It represents a year that conjures boldness, movement, and the willingness to run toward what calls you without looking back for approval. But none of that happens by accident. It happens because you choose it. Because only you can activate the frequency within yourself that matches the life you say you want.<br /><br />These tarotscopes aren’t predictive; they’re channeled directions. It’s Spirit showing you exactly what needs to come alive inside of you to make this year everything you've been building toward. This is your roadmap to alignment. It’s your permission slip to step into the fullest expression of who you came here to be.<br /><br />Read for your sun, moon, and rising signs. Let the messages land where they need to. And then do the work of activation.<figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954052.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Aries (March 21 - April 19) The Tower + Seven of Wands</strong><br /><br />Stop defending what's already dead and chasing past regrets. You’ve been fighting to keep structures standing that were never meant to survive your next level. Whether these are limiting beliefs or old shadows and traumas, this year requires you to activate your capacity for complete demolition. It’s not the gentle release you’ve been attempting, or possibly avoiding, but the full burn. The Tower is here to tell you that what needs to fall will fall, with or without your permission, and your job is to stop trying to save it. Instead, focus that warrior energy on claiming new ground and observing what the Tower’s destruction reveals to you about yourself and what you’ve allowed. Your best year comes when you stop protecting old territory and start building your empire from the ground up. Let it collapse. You were made to rebuild from nothing.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954053.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Taurus (April 20 - May 20) The Empress + Five of Pentacles<br /></strong><br />Activate your divine right to receive all the desires you want. You’ve been operating from scarcity consciousness while sitting on a throne, convinced you need to earn every crumb through suffering. That ends now. This year demands that you embody the Empress, the one who knows abundance is her birthright, not a reward for good behavior. Stop waiting for permission to live well and luxurious. Stop punishing yourself with lack and limitation as proof of your worthiness. Your best year unfolds when you plant yourself in the soil of your own value and refuse to negotiate. The harvest is already yours. Claim it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954054.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Gemini (May 21 - June 20) The Magician + Two of Swords<br /></strong><br />Your words are spells and your ideas are architecture. We all know this. This year, you need to activate your voice as your primary tool of manifestation, and that requires you to choose. You’ve been sitting on the fence, hedging your bets, and keeping your magic theoretical. That’s over. The Magician demands sharp decisions. It requires commitment, the willingness to speak your vision into being and then back it up with strategic action. Your best year happens when you stop intellectualizing and start declaring or delegating to your Spirits. Make the choice. Say it out loud. Then watch what you've been talking about finally take form.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954055.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Cancer (June 21 - July 22) The Moon + Strength<br /></strong><br />Cancer, this is vital: Trust your psychic knowing over everyone else’s logic.

This year activates your emotional sovereignty. It’s the part of you that moves through the unknown with your inner compass as your only guide. Your best year comes when you stop treating your sensitivity like a weakness and start recognizing it as your superpower — no ifs, ands, or buts. The path isn’t clear, but your intuitive GPS is so sharp. Prepare to shock yourself. Ultimately, you’re not supposed to see the whole way. Move anyway.

This year demands that you activate your full radiance and let it be medicine for your community. Your best year unfolds when you stop rationing your gifts and start pouring them out like libations. Celebrate loudly. Gather your people. Let them see what it looks like when someone refuses to shrink. Your joy is your offering. Your brightness gives others permission. Stop playing small.

This year asks you to honor the process without making yourself wrong for being in it. Your best year comes when you stop perfecting yourself into a corner and start building something that reflects your actual genius, not your fear of being exposed. You’re already good enough to do the work. Now do it without the side of shame.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954058.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Libra (September 23 - October 22) Justice + The Lovers<br /></strong><br />Choose yourself with the same conviction you use to choose everyone else. You’ve been sacrificing at the altar of other people’s comfort and maintaining peace at the expense of your power. This year demands reciprocity and equity. The scale is tipping in your favor for once. Your best year happens when you activate your understanding that self-selection is sacred, not selfish. Stop negotiating your needs down to make room for everyone else’s wants. This year is about you being selfish. The right people will meet you where you are. The wrong ones will reveal themselves. Both outcomes serve you.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954059.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Scorpio (October 23 - November 21) Death + Ace of Cups<br /></strong><br />You love transformation, the phoenix moment. But this year asks you to activate rebirth without the addiction to intensity. What if you could open to new love, new emotional terrain, and new beginnings without requiring everything to go up in flames first? Your best year comes when you learn that transformation doesn't have to hurt to be real. And you don't have to keep “healing” in order to learn important lessons. Let something be born from softness. Let yourself feel without destroying yourself in the process. You can change without the drama. Try it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954060.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Sagittarius (November 22 - December 21) Temperance + The Chariot<br /></strong><br />Harness your fire instead of letting it burn you out. You’re all acceleration, no integration. You’re moving so fast the lessons never land. This year activates your ability to embody your philosophy instead of just preaching it.

<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jesstheebesttcolor/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jess Gonzalez</a>, Pravana color expert and celebrity colorist, predicts that bronde — a mix of blonde and brunette — will evolve, taking inspiration from fashion, specifically the neutrals in our closets, like khaki. “Soft, melted, and cozy is the vibe of khaki bronde,” says Gonzalez — but don’t let the word khaki put you off; it’s nowhere near green. “Using a color melting technique, khaki bronde is a muted gold with hints of ash,” explains Gonzalez, much like this color created by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jesstheebesttcolor/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tay Ramirez.</a> </p>



<p>The addition of darker, ashier tones dials down the intensity of the blonde, lending the overall finish a more organic-looking, lived-in effect. “It flatters a wide range of skin tones, and it’s great for clients that want their hair to look natural or natural-ish,” says Gonzalez. She suggests asking for a “seamless lift and a color melt” over the top.  </p>

<p>Last year’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cowgirl-copper-hair-color"">cowgirl copper</a> is entering a new, brighter phase: soft apricot blonde. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/seanmichaelhair/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sean Michael</a>, owner of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thesalonbeau/?hl=en"">Salon Beau</a>, describes this as a “warm blonde with a subtle peach undertone,” occupying a cozy space between copper, strawberry blonde, and golden blonde. “It creates a bright and luminous look without the harsh contrast of icy or very cool blondes, which makes it appealing as more clients shift toward softer, warmer tones this year,” explains Michael. </p>



<p>Happily, he says this shade works well for both natural blondes and brunettes who want a vibrant result that still looks natural and blended.

<p>Barron-Hough describes lush truffle as a “sophisticated, expensive-looking shade that’s full of warmth, glowy tones, and indulgent truffle pigments.” She adds, “This trend reflects a shift away from cooler brown hues towards rich brunettes with a slightly warm, red glow.” Think Kelly Gale, Kiera Knightly, and Lana Del Rey — or curly hair specialist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jesseniaspallet?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jessenia Robayo</a> here.  </p>



<p>Barron-Hough says there isn’t a hair texture that it doesn’t look great on. For multi-textured hair, she suggests asking for a semi-permanent color. “This will add depth, tone, and lots of hydrating properties,” she says.  </p>

<p>Hazan says that striking blonde will be just as popular this year as it was in 2025, but this time, the focus is on dialing up the shine. The key? Investing in an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-hair-gloss-products"">at-home gloss</a>.

<p>Cashmere brunette is defined by a handful of very fine wisps of blonde throughout, rather than strong, high-contrast highlights, says Michael. “It reflects light evenly, photographs well, and grows out cleanly, which makes it a good option for people who want a lower-maintenance color that still has dimension,” he adds. </p>



<p>Michael says it looks especially beautiful on natural brunettes with medium to deeper skin tones. “It’s a strong choice for anyone who wants professional, polished, but healthy-looking color with longer wear between appointments.” This shade posted to Instagram by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DJg9HB5TQp8/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miho Mai</a> is beautiful. </p>

<p>Blanche blonde has “cloud dancer,” Pantone’s color of the year, to thank for its inception, says Gonzalez. “It’s a bright and ethereal pale blonde,” she explains. But it’s not for the fainthearted or those short on time. “A bold color like this requires monthly salon visits and treatments,” explains Gonzalez, specifically bonding treatments to counteract the drying effects of bleach. “It’s a high-maintenance color,” adds Gonzalez, “but when done right, it’s so striking.” She recommends asking for a bleach and tone with icy, milky highlights.

<p>Barron-Hough also makes a case for blanche blonde and has a feeling that it’s going to be <em>the </em>shade of 2026: “As blanche contains neither warm nor cool hues, it appears bright and ultra-reflective, making it a very fashion-forward look,” she says, adding that it looks especially cool on bobs and shorter cropped styles. </p>

<p>Highlights are getting an upgrade for 2026. At Haug, they’re delicately threaded into a darker base to create the illusion of depth, as though hair has been lightly sun-kissed rather than bleached. The goal? To make the color look as natural as possible, says Haug. And placement is paramount. Around the face, shoulders, and near the temples, where hair naturally has bounce, allows the highlights to really pop — like this shade by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DTGEcTPjPY2/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Annabelle Arnold</a>. </p>

<p>The<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/golden-globe-awards-red-carpet-fashion-2026""> 83rd annual Golden Globe Awards</a> took place last night (January 11), and by all means, it was business as usual for the official kick-off to the 2026 <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7594276237799968030"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">awards season</a>. Which, to be clear, isn’t a good thing. As anyone who’s logging onto social media, turning on their TV, or doom scrolling on their TikTok FYP daily knows, the times are anything but normal — and we shouldn’t be acting like they are. </p>



<p>Kicking off the show, often touted as Hollywood’s biggest party, two-time host <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/02/9339653/nikki-glaser-taylor-swift-apology"">Nikki Glaser </a>made a subtle allusion to the current political and social climate,<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hpHj5wNYDw""> welcoming celebs and viewers</a> to the event that was “without a doubt the most important thing happening in the world right now.” And then, that was pretty much it.</p>



<p>To recap: the past year has seen a brutal decimation of human rights across the United States. Since the start of his second term in office, President Donald Trump and his administration have <a href=""https://civilrights.org/trump-rollbacks/#2025"">rolled back DEI initiatives </a>across sectors, issued executive orders to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/birthright-citzenship-trump"">end birthright citizenship</a> and suspend the admission of refugees to the country, as well as targeted Transgender Americans by defining “sex” as binary and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/trump-transition-healthcare-funding-hhs"">proposing an immediate pause on gender-affirming</a> care. In addition to this, his administration has increased <a href=""https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/big-budget-act-creates-deportation-industrial-complex"">funding to United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)</a>, <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy9z7yg2n7o"">deploying the National Guard </a>into cities across the country and inciting violence. Earlier this month, a Minneapolis citizen, Renee Good, was <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jepdjy256o"">shot and killed by an ICE agent</a>. Oh, and the President of the United States is set to<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/jan/09/france-delays-g7-summit-white-house-ufc-trump-birthday""> hold a UFC figh</a>t this July to celebrate his 80th birthday, held on the White Houses’ South Lawn. (Which isn’t a social injustice, but <em>is</em> tacky as hell). </p>



<p>These are arguably the most unprecedented of unprecedented times; yet the Golden Globes felt like something straight out of  the 2016 feminism and activism handbook — ie: soap boxing with little to no substance. Talking around some of the most prevalent and dire issues of the moment without actually speaking to them in a way that would cause conversation or discomfort (which, to be clear, is needed). </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Look at the billions of eyeballs on all of us collectively, there should be no outliers of the industry who are the outspoken ones…out there on their own with this amount of privilege.”  </p><cite>Jameela Jamil </cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Presenting the award for Male Actor in a Limited Series, Anthology Series, Made for TV Movie, Kathryn Hahn and Melissa McCarthy took to the stage to sarcastically congratulate men on finally being recognized for their acting chops, as well as their abilities to show their range playing so many roles, as McCarthy put it “Husband! Ex-husband! Secretary! And everybody’s favorite: nosy neighbor.” It was a moment of comedy meant to be a tongue-in-cheek jab at ongoing conversations around men’s dominance in the profession that failed to be either funny or actually impactful. The feeling was similar to actress Natalie Portman’s now-infamous statement at the 2018 Golden Globes while presenting the award for Best Director, where she <a href=""https://deadline.com/2018/01/natalie-portman-all-male-directors-category-remark-prompts-reaction-golden-globes-1202238326/"">pointedly called out the categories’ list of all-male nominees</a>. It was a strong statement, until you consider the fact that — between 2018 and this year — Portman has herself worked with no female directors. (In the words of queen <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11932309/kirsten-dunst-female-directors-hollywood-tiff-2025"">Kirsten Dunst</a>: “<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11932309/kirsten-dunst-female-directors-hollywood-tiff-2025"">It’s very simple</a>” to work with female directors). </p>



<p>Later in the show, Noah Wyle, the hunky lead of hit HBO series <em>The Pitt  </em>– which unflinching depicts the reality of being a healthcare worker in America — picked up two Golden Globe Awards, during which he broadly thanked healthcare workers, without speaking to any of the current ways in which the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/26/us-health-insurance-system-doctors"">health care system is inaccessible </a>to the majority of Americans. And Nikki Glaser ribbed Leonardo DiCaprio for continuing to date women under 30 instead of questioning why someone who claims to be a climate activist would<a href=""https://variety.com/2025/biz/columns/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-wedding-bad-taste-1236442892/""> attend Jeff Bezos’ wedding</a>. And even though <em>One Battle After Another </em>is a satire about revolution, critiquing anti-immigration and extremist white nationalist groups, those issues weren’t directly addressed in the speeches when the film won. </p>



<p>It was…dissapointing to say the least. </p>



<p>Maybe this characterization is unfair. And some celebrities did subtly use their platforms for good last night. But the idea of asking and expecting celebrities to speak truth to power is nothing new. In fact, fans have been demanding it for years. Largely, these calls to action have been met with a divisive response from people both in and outside of the industry. In 2020, then- Golden Globes host <a href=""https://deadline.com/2020/01/golden-globes-politics-ricky-gervais-1202821552/"">Ricky Gervais directly warned celebrities</a> not to talk about politics in their acceptance speeches, saying:  “You’re in no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg. If you win, come up, accept your little award, thank your agent and your god, and fuck off.” </p>

<p>In 2021, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2024/01/11638286/golden-globes-2024-apolitical-genocide#:~:text=There%20is%20a%20long%20history,glitz%2C%20glamour%2C%20and%20escapism."">reflecting on that comment after yet another apolitical Golden Globe awards</a> ceremony, Refinery29’s Senior Content Director, Entertainment Kathleen Newman-Bremang wrote about understanding the inclination to want to tell stars to essentially “shut up and look pretty.” It’s one that many stars we look to seem to hold, or at least cower behind, themselves.</p>



<p>In a November 2025 interview, <em>Die My Love</em> actress Jennifer Lawrence spoke about her decision to not speak openly about her politics, specifically the actions of President Donald Trump. In an interview with The New York Times’ <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQotp7ejvJi/?igsh=eDVnZWtuNG41ZHFh""><em>The Interview </em></a>podcast, Lawrence said that, after spending the President’s first term “running around like a chicken with [her] head cut off,” she felt speaking out wouldn’t have an impact. “We’ve learned election after election, celebrities do not make a difference whatsoever on who people vote for,” Lawrence said. “So then what am I doing? I’m just sharing my opinion on something that’s going to add fuel to a fire that’s ripping the country apart. We are so divided.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>We need celebrities, with platforms and the ability to reach to and speak to people on every side of these issues, by virtue of their influence, to be vocal about the reality of what’s happening and what the impact is for everyone. </p><cite>katherine singh</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Lawrence went on to say that she wouldn’t want her personal politics to deter people from coming to see her films, media that, in her words, could “change consciousness or change the world.” While we admire the ambition and trust in her craft (and yes, it is true that art can literally change lives) — please, give us a break. Just say you don’t want to alienate people that will contribute to your bottom line. </p>



<p>But the fact remains that, despite what any comedians or Jennifer Lawrence may think, these celebrities and their platforms do have influence and can elicit change, especially when it comes to <a href=""https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/the_oprah_effect"">political leaders</a>. When Taylor Swift <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/sep/11/taylor-swift-endorses-kamala-harris-president-us-debate-cat-lady"">publicly supported Kamala Harris</a> ahead of the November 2024 Presidential election, sharing her intent to vote for the candidate on Instagram, she <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/taylor-swift-kamala-harris-endorsement-vote-gov/"">drove over 400,000 people</a> to the <a href=""http://vote.gov"">vote.gov</a> site over the next 24 hours. <em>Bridgerton</em> actress Nicola Coughlan, who has continued to post frequently to Palestinian aid organizations, has helped <a href=""https://tribune.com.pk/story/2476904/bridgerton-star-nicola-coughlan-raises-over-2-million-for-palestine-despite-hollywoods-warnings"">raise over $2 million USD</a> to date. </p>



<p>To be fair, that’s not to say that celebrities have completely eschewed speaking up and out about what’s currently happening in the country. Walking the red carpet ahead of the 83rd annual Golden Globes show, a handful of stars did speak out about the need for celebrities and lay people alike to be vocal about the current climate in the United States. Speaking to <em>Refinery29, Poker Face</em> actress Natasha Lyon, who donned a pin declaring ICE OUT, said: “I just think it’s important that we don’t normalize what’s going on in this country right now. I love America, I love us, I love our communities,  free speech, I love the Trevor Project and all that. I think it’s important. Renee Good, say her name.” Lyon was one of several actors, including Tessa Thompson, Wanda Sykes, and Mark Ruffalo, who wore pins that said “<a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2026/01/11/golden-globes-ice-protest-pin-mark-ruffalo-wanda-sykes/88134903007/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Be Good</a>,” speaking out against the actions of ICE and in support of Good and Keith Porter Jr., who was also killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. The <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/article/heres-why-stars-are-wearing-ice-out-and-be-good-pins-at-the-2026-golden-globes"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Be Good campaign</a> was launched by advocacy groups in response to ICE’s $1000 million “wartime recruitment campaign” aimed at expanding enforcement officers. <em>Hacks</em> star Hannah Einbinder also walked the carpet donning an <a href=""https://www.artists4ceasefire.org/about"">Artists4Ceasefire pin</a> — a red carpet fashion staple for her. </p>

<p>Later on the same carpet, actress Yvette Nicole Brown was even more explicit with her distaste for the current administration, telling <em>Refinery29</em>’s Unbothered the thing that’s bothering her deeply is, simply: “Our government. That orange ghoul that is terrorizing us everyday,” before warning viewers that “it’s about to be really real, get ready.” </p>



<p>And while accepting her third Golden Globe for Actress in a Musical or Comedy Series, <em>Hacks</em> star Jean Smart also took her moment on-stage to<a href=""https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a69966807/jean-smart-best-actress-tv-comedy-golden-globes-speech-transcript-2026/""> encourage viewers to take action</a>, saying: “There’s just a lot that could be said tonight; I said my rant on the red carpet, so I won’t do it here….But let’s all do the right thing. I think everybody in their hearts knows what the right thing is to do. So let’s do the right thing.” Smart was referring to earlier comments she made on the carpet, telling reporters that filming of the upcoming season of the show was overshadowed by the current goings on in the country, stating: “I feel like we’re kind of at a turning point in this country, and I hope people can keep their heads because that’s actually, really, the hardest thing, I think, is to keep our heads. It’s going to take a lot of courage and concerns, but I think that’s important.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954340.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=695&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A695"" /></figure>



<p>While fashion has long been political, and these small moments of resistance can be important,  it’s hard to feel like a handful of celebs donning obscured, teeny-tiny pins or making veiled comments about triumphing over fear is enough, or anywhere near enough — because it’s really not.</p>



<p>We need celebrities, with platforms and the ability to reach to and speak to people on every side of these issues, by virtue of their influence, to be vocal about the reality of what’s happening and what the impact is for everyone. We need these big names with big money and big studios attached to them to take action — whether that’s boycotting award shows or refusing to speak to anything other than these issues at this moment in time. </p>



<p>It feels like the bare minimum, and actress Jameela Jamil agrees. Speaking to <em>Refinery29 </em>at the Spotify x The Hollywood Reporter Golden Globes Nominees Night, the British actress — who is a vocal activist — spoke to the inability of many of her colleagues to speak out against injustices, pondering, “Am I brave or are they cowards?”</p>



<p>“I think they’re being greedy and weird and disappointing,” Jamil continued. “Look at the billions of eyeballs on all of us collectively, there should be no outliers of the industry who are the outspoken ones…out there on their own with this amount of privilege.” Jamil pointed to actors like Mark Ruffalo, who has<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DTZBbZLDI3c/?hl=en""> often and vocally spoken out against injustices</a>, noting that, when we look at people like him, we weaponize the word “brave” as a way to separate ourselves, removing ourselves from the expectation that we can and will do the same. “So we rely on individuals to do what would be so much easier to achieve as a collective.” </p>

<p>And if the Golden Globes are any indicator of what this upcoming awards season will hold when it comes to celebs speaking out, it feels like — once again — Ruffalo will be an outlier. </p>



<p>But as disappointing as the apoliticalness of this awards show was, maybe the bigger disappointment is the fact that we continue to hope and ask for anything different from those we look up to onscreen, and continue to be disappointed when they don’t follow through. Because truly, what can we really expect? At the end of the day, this industry is all about the bottom line. And our faves, who we idolize, meme, emulate and form a parasocial bond with, are largely going to stay on the side of the line that makes sure they get their bag – as long as these injustices don’t impact or affect them directly. </p>



<p>So, for the next few months, award show contenders, winners, and Hollywood ingenues will have the spotlight on them. As they have every other awards’ season, they’ll thank their families and agents; tearfully, they’ll talk about hardship and determination, picking themselves up and trying again. And maybe it’s time we stop hoping for more. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11615800.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>It’s 8 p.m. on a Saturday in 2023 on my 30th birthday and I am standing on my own, stone-cold sober, wailing my way through Robbie Williams’ “Angels” at a crowded Italian restaurant in London. Up until this moment, karaoke had always been something I would have never done without drinking, in part because of my fear that people would judge me or find me embarrassing. But here I was, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sober-curious-trend-companies"">a year into sobriety</a>, savoring the mad and euphoric feeling of being fully aware of my actions, surrounded by both loved ones and strangers, and not feeling a shred of social anxiety.</p>



<p>The biggest and most mortifying surprise of my life was just how much <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-non-alcoholic-drinks-to-buy"">fun I could have without drinking</a>. While I wouldn’t say I was addicted to alcohol, I was definitely dependent on it throughout my twenties — it was my social lubricant and tool for emotional regulation in unfamiliar settings. It’s how I celebrated, commiserated, and ended an otherwise banal work day. I’d come to expect drinking to always equal fun and therefore fun to always equal drinking.</p>



<p>There were of course plenty of times when this wasn’t true and the hangover, anxiety, and impact on my debit card showed it was far from worth it. But there was always the hope that this next dinner or night out or post-work drinks would be as glittering as some past one I remembered. Even when I’d tried reducing or stopping my drinking before — especially when I found it was triggering my debilitating <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/10/10714981/ocd-pandemic-photos-emotional-impact"">obsessive compulsive disorder</a> — I subconsciously held firm onto this idea that any fun I had sober would be even more fun when drinking.</p>



<p>It was only when I started a new medication for my OCD [Obsessive Compulsive Disorder] at the beginning of 2022 that I truly began to confront this idea. I stopped drinking and life went on. After a few pub evenings and birthday parties where I felt awkward and withdrawn, I began to embrace acting like a fool and being fully cognizant of it.</p>



<p>Celebrations became riotously fun as I had as much, if not more, fun as I ever did drinking. Two full years on, I maintain that stopping drinking is one of the best decisions I’ve made in my adult life. And more importantly, I’ve experienced all the fun and giddy glee sober that I was inadvertently chasing in a bottle.</p>



<p>This is why I am a firm believer that everyone who drinks should try life without alcohol in some capacity and that if you are considering quitting entirely, there’s no time like the present. But, now, as we roll into another unavoidably grey and miserly January, it is also why I think that for some, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dry-january-tips-las-vegas"">Dry January</a> (spending the whole month sober as a mental and physical reset) might not be the way you begin to experience the joy of a reduced or even alcohol-free life.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Celebrations became riotously fun as I had as much, if not more, fun as I ever did drinking.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>I want to be very clear that I’m not criticizing Dry January. It’s a really important initiative led by the brilliant charity <a href=""https://alcoholchange.org.uk/?gclid=CjwKCAiAsIGrBhAAEiwAEzMlC_dCV3SllAnAyUM_X49ajHaShnQGpiZKzdz4f3-Nxrp5Uy98bMp47xoCyIcQAvD_BwE"">Alcohol Change UK</a>, who do important work reducing alcohol harm. It also gives people a “socially acceptable” reason to stop drinking if they struggle with peer pressure. Moreover, people’s relationship with alcohol varies greatly — the more dependent or addicted you are, the more you need to <a href=""https://alcoholchange.org.uk/help-and-support/get-help-now"">consult a professional</a>, like your doctor, before making any big changes, and so the framing that works for me or someone else could be irrelevant for you.</p>



<p>There is no one-size-fits-all approach to reworking your relationship with alcohol, and for some people it may mean complete abstinence. <a href=""https://www.taraswart.com/"">Tara Swart Bieber</a><a href=""https://www.taraswart.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">, MD</a>, tells us: “If someone is misusing or abusing alcohol then medical supervision would be necessary if they wanted to stop. If someone stops and gets symptoms of withdrawal then they should contact their [doctor]. If they are drinking socially and not more than the recommended limits, then they can stop without medical guidance.”</p>



<p>My point though is that taking a month off, especially in January’s grim weather and post-holiday-decadence haze, can just reaffirm the idea that sobriety is boring. As Annabelle Bonus, director of research, policy and strategy at <a href=""https://www.drinkaware.co.uk/?gclid=CjwKCAiAsIGrBhAAEiwAEzMlCxuWH2oLE6dQY6DfPY08UEDAQ62RKzAReWwGTkHuavi6XOc83-pwNhoCZDAQAvD_BwE"">Drinkaware UK</a>, tells Refinery29: “Initiatives like Dry January can give people a really clear target if they want to cut down or try to stop drinking completely. While they work really well for some people, other people can find them hard to stick to and that’s completely normal.”</p>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/milliegooch/?hl=en"">Millie Gooch</a>, founder of <a href=""https://sobergirlsociety.com/"">Sober Girl Society</a>, a community safe space for sober women changing their relationship with alcohol, agrees. As an advocate for Dry January, she underlines why she supports the initiative. “Where people might have overdone it over the holiday season, Dry January can provide a much-needed break for your body and mind,” she says. “On the flip side, not much socializing happens in January and although this can make not drinking easier, it doesn’t give you as much of a chance to flex your sober socializing muscles.” This can mean the idea of a dinner/night out/festival sober maintains a veneer of intimidation.</p>



<p>The way I’ve combatted this is to focus on getting in at least one social activity where you would in the past have been drinking and experiencing it sober. This can be intimidating at first, especially if you experience social anxiety in social situations. But one big secret I only realized when I stopped drinking is that pretty much <em>everyone</em> feels that way in new social situations. I’ve learned that it will dissipate after an hour or so as people relax — whether they’re drinking or not. And riding that anxiety out becomes far less challenging as you keep trying.</p>



<p>“This [technique of riding out the anxiety] is one of the central tenets of exposure therapy,” explains Sheri Jacobson, PhD, a retired psychotherapist and founder of psychotherapy clinic <a href=""https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/sheri-jacobson.htm"">Harley Therapy</a>. “You can track your anxiety on a self-reported scale one to 10, and you will notice the anxiety comes down at each 10-minute interval that passes. Most things will dissipate over time.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>But one big secret I only realized when I stopped drinking is that pretty much <em>everyone</em> feels anxious in new social situations.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Dr. Jacobson emphasizes that it’s psychologically important to make positive associations around not drinking, whether that’s just for one evening or for the foreseeable future. </p>



<p>“What happens in drinking is that there’s a general lowering of inhibitions, which may allow us to speak more freely and be less anxious,” she explains. “The short-term motivation is that we gain these benefits of maybe being more sociable than we would be and a greater sense of freedom. In order to stop drinking, we have to look at the things that are negative for us, and then switch those into something more positive.”</p>



<p>The positives of not drinking are very clear to me. In my experience, it is not just those to your physical and mental health (though those are significant) but learning to overcome social anxiety in awkward situations, feeling at ease in yourself, having better ability to listen to your body when it says it needs food or rest, and then actively choosing to go home (or stay out). You can feel the crispness of euphoria in high definition without it being clouded by booze, you can dip out of repetitive, drunk conversations without anyone being offended (because they’re drunk), and save money. What’s even more fun is that you channel it into something else, be it something you’ve always wanted to try (pottery!) or silly little treats (chocolates!).</p>



<p>Drinking is fun and for many can be the spark that lights the best night of your life. But it doesn’t have to be. Whether you’re attempting Dry January or not, it’s truly worth trying to have a good night without it — one that’s not just calm and clarified but raucous and silly, if that’s what you need. </p>



<p>That won’t be guaranteed the first time you order a lime and soda at your local. As Bonus puts it: “With any sort of behavior change, like cutting down drinking, it should be thought of as a journey rather than something that’s going to change overnight.” But if you find a whole month a prescriptive suggestion or you’re worried that losing drinking will hamper your joy, I am proof that it won’t. And don’t let the grim weather trick you into believing otherwise.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951226.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings, this second week of 2026 brings a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/january-monthly-horoscope-2026-meanings-effects"">relatively calm astrological atmosphere</a>, especially compared to the intensity of recent weeks, offering space to slow down and reflect. On January 11th, the asteroid Vesta enters Aquarius, shifting our focus toward devotion beyond the self. Vesta, though less commonly discussed, represents what we tend to with quiet consistency, our inner flame and sense of purpose. In Aquarius, that devotion turns toward community, collective progress, and future-minded ideals. It’s a reminder to examine where we are giving our energy and whether those commitments truly align with the world we want to help build. </p>



<p>At the same time, we’re in the final stretch of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-capricorn-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Venus in Capricorn</a> and the last <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">full week of Capricorn Season</a>. With the sun, Mercury, Venus, and Mars all in Capricorn, the emphasis is on responsibility, long-term planning, and emotional maturity. This is a productive time to get organized financially and to have honest, clarifying conversations in both friendships and romantic relationships. The shadow of this energy, however, can show up as rigidity, emotional guardedness, or being overly hard on yourself. There may also be a temptation to equate security with control or accumulation rather than trust and reciprocity. </p>



<p>From January 15th through January 17th, we enter the dark-of-the-moon in Capricorn, the reflective days leading up to the Capricorn New Moon on January 18th. Energy can feel lower, emotions more sensitive, and internal pressure around goals or responsibilities may rise. Instead of pushing for answers or outcomes, this is a time to rest, reflect, and release what no longer feels sustainable. </p>



<p>The shift begins on January 17th, when Venus enters Aquarius, helping us loosen our grip and open up to new ways of relating. This week is less about taking action and more about conscious closure, creating space so the intentions set at the New Moon can take root with clarity and purpose. </p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, this week highlights a meaningful shift in your friendship, community, and technology sector as both Vesta and Venus move into Aquarius, with Vesta arriving on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th. Vesta’s presence asks you to reflect on where your energy, time, and loyalty have been going socially and digitally, and whether those commitments still feel aligned. As Venus joins Vesta later in the week, relationships within your wider circle take on a warmer, more intentional tone. You may feel drawn to reconnect with friends who inspire you, collaborate on creative or tech- forward ideas, or redefine what support and reciprocity look like in your community. This is a powerful moment to invest in connections that feel future-oriented rather than obligatory. </p>



<p>At the same time, you’re moving through the final <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">stretch of Capricorn Season</a>, which has activated your career and long-term goals sector. Over the past few weeks, you may have been pushed to take your ambitions more seriously, confront professional realities, or step into greater leadership and responsibility. </p>



<p>As we approach the Capricorn New Moon on January 18th, the days leading up to it mark the dark of the moon in this area of your life. This can stir doubts about whether you’re on the right path, highlight burnout, or make you more aware of the pressure you place on yourself to succeed. Instead of judging these feelings, allow them to surface as useful information. Rest where you can, reflect on what feels unsustainable, and release outdated definitions of success. This New Moon is about redefining your legacy on your own terms, and honoring the version of ambition that supports both your growth and your well-being. </p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, you may have felt yourself stretching beyond your comfort zone <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">all Capricorn Season</a>, and now these next few days are encouraging you to spread your wings even further. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, your career, visibility, and long-term aspirations sector is activated. Vesta brings focus and devotion to the work you’re building and the reputation you are cultivating, asking you to reconnect with what truly motivates you professionally. </p>



<p>As Venus conjoins Vesta, there is an opportunity to feel more supported, appreciated, or inspired in your public life. You may receive recognition, have meaningful conversations about your future, or feel drawn toward work that feels more aligned with your values and vision rather than just security. </p>



<p>At the same time, we’re in the final stretch of Capricorn Season, which has been activating your sector of growth, travel, education, and big-picture belief systems. Over the past few weeks, you may have been rethinking what expansion really looks like for you and which paths are worth committing to long term. </p>



<p>As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, doubts or restlessness can surface, especially around whether you are limiting yourself out of fear or practicality. This is not a sign that you’re oﬀ track, but an invitation to pause and reflect. Give yourself permission to rest, journal, or step back from decision-making. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will offer a reset around your direction and purpose, helping you set intentions for a future that feels both grounded and expansive, built on trust in your ability to grow beyond what feels familiar. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Capricorn Season</a> has been asking you to go deeper than usual, and this week invites you to look at growth through a more expansive, future-facing lens. On January 11th, Vesta enters Aquarius, followed by Venus on January 17th, activating your sector of higher learning, travel, publishing, and belief systems. Vesta encourages you to recommit to ideas, philosophies, or long-term visions that genuinely inspire you, especially ones connected to education, spirituality, or sharing your voice more widely. </p>



<p>As Venus conjoins Vesta this week, curiosity turns into pleasure and motivation. You may feel more excited about learning something new, planning a trip, teaching, or reconnecting with a sense of purpose that extends beyond day-to-day responsibilities. </p>



<p>At the same time, you are in the final stretch of Capricorn Season, which has been illuminating themes of intimacy, shared resources, emotional vulnerability, and trust. Over the past few weeks, you may have been navigating deeper emotional or financial conversations, confronting patterns around dependence, power, or security. As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, these themes can feel heavier, bringing up doubts, fatigue, or the urge to retreat. Rather than overanalyzing what surfaces, allow yourself space to rest and process. This is a powerful time to release emotional baggage or financial stressors that no longer align with who you are becoming. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will oﬀer a reset around how you merge, share, and commit, helping you build deeper connections and a more sustainable sense of emotional and material support.</p>

<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, this week may feel like a turning point in how you relate to the people closest to you. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, your sector of intimacy, shared resources, and emotional bonds is activated. Vesta asks you to reflect on where your emotional energy and loyalty have been going, especially in close relationships, financial partnerships, or situations that require mutual trust. </p>



<p>As Venus conjoins Vesta this week, conversations around vulnerability, support, and reciprocity can soften. This is a powerful moment to renegotiate emotional or financial agreements, deepen a bond through honesty, or choose connection that feels empowering rather than draining. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, you’re moving through the final stretch of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Capricorn Season</a>, which has been illuminating your partnership sector all month. Relationships of all kinds may have required more eﬀort, accountability, or emotional maturity than usual. As we enter the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, doubts or sensitivities around commitment, balance, or whether your needs are truly being met can surface. You may feel more emotionally exposed or tired of carrying relational weight on your own. Instead of reacting, allow yourself to pause and listen to what your emotions are revealing. Rest, create space, and release expectations that feel one-sided or outdated. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will bring a powerful reset for your relationships, helping you set intentions for partnerships that support your growth, emotional safety, and long-term fulfillment. </p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, this week invites you to rethink how you show up in your closest connections and daily commitments. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, your relationship sector is activated, bringing focus to partnerships, collaborations, and the give-and-take dynamics in your life. </p>



<p>Vesta asks you to reflect on where your devotion and energy are going within one-on-one connections, and whether those relationships feel reciprocal and aligned. As Venus conjoins Vesta this week, there’s an opportunity to soften tensions, reconnect through honest conversation, or attract partnerships that feel both supportive and intellectually stimulating. This can be a meaningful moment for redefining what commitment looks like for you moving forward. </p>



<p>At the same time, you’re in the final stretch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Capricorn Season</a>, which has been highlighting your work, routines, and overall well-being. Over the past few weeks, you may have felt pressure to be more disciplined, productive, or responsible with your time and energy. As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, fatigue, self-criticism, or doubts about sustainability can surface. This is your cue to slow down rather than push harder. Prioritize rest, simplify where possible, and release habits that drain you. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will oﬀer a reset around how you care for your body, manage your workload, and create routines that support both your ambition and your vitality. </p>

<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, this week encourages you to reconnect with joy, creativity, and the things that make life feel meaningful rather than merely productive. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, your sector of daily routines, work habits, and well-being is activated. Vesta asks you to reflect on how devoted you’ve been to your responsibilities and whether your current systems actually support your health and happiness. </p>



<p>As Venus unites with Vesta this week, there’s an opportunity to bring more pleasure, ease, and even creativity into your everyday life. You may feel inspired to refresh your schedule, collaborate differently at work, or prioritize routines that feel nourishing rather than obligatory. </p>



<p>At the same time, you’re in the final stretch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Capricorn Season</a>, which has been activating your sector of romance, creativity, and self-expression. Over the past few weeks, you may have been taking your passions or love life more seriously, questioning what feels worth your time and emotional investment. </p>



<p>As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, self-doubt, creative blocks, or emotional heaviness can surface, especially if you’ve been pushing yourself to perform or prove something. Instead of critiquing yourself, allow space for rest and reflection. Step back from perfectionism and release pressure around outcomes. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will bring a sense of renewal around joy and self-expression, helping you set intentions that honor both your creative desires and your need for stability. </p>

<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, this week invites you to slow down and get reacquainted with what truly feels like home. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and your ruler Venus following on January 17th, your sector of creativity, romance, pleasure, and self-expression is activated. Vesta asks you to reflect on where your heart has been investing its energy, whether in love, creative projects, or personal passions. </p>



<p>As Venus unites with Vesta this week, inspiration flows more easily, and you may feel drawn toward connections or pursuits that allow you to express yourself more freely and authentically. This is a beautiful moment to recommit to joy, play, and creative risks that feel aligned with who you are becoming. </p>



<p>At the same time, you’re in the final stretch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Capricorn season</a>, which has been emphasizing themes around home, family, and emotional foundations. Over the past few weeks, you may have been addressing responsibilities or boundaries within your personal life, possibly feeling the weight of expectations tied to your roots or living situation. </p>



<p>As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, emotions can run deeper, bringing up fatigue, sensitivity, or questions about where you truly feel safe and supported. Rather than forcing clarity, allow yourself to rest and observe what is surfacing. The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will oﬀer a reset around your sense of belonging, helping you plant seeds for a home life that feels both stable and emotionally nourishing. </p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, this week encourages you to tune into your inner world and the conversations shaping your daily life. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, your sector of home, family, and emotional foundations is activated. </p>



<p>Vesta asks you to reflect on where your emotional energy and sense of devotion are rooted, especially within your living space or family dynamics. This is the ideal week for you to re-organize your home, sage your space, and set necessary boundaries with family members. </p>



<p>As Venus joins forces with Vesta this week, there’s an opportunity for you to soften emotional walls, create more beauty or comfort at home, or have heartfelt conversations that bring healing and understanding. You may feel called to redefine what “home” means to you, both physically and emotionally. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, you’re in the final stretch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Capricorn Season</a>, which has been activating your communication, mindset, and learning sector. Over the past few weeks, you may have been more intentional about your words, boundaries, and the information you engage with. As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, mental fatigue, self-doubt, or emotional heaviness around conversations and decisions can surface. This is a signal to slow your pace and give your mind space to rest. Journal, unplug when possible, and release thought patterns that feel overly critical or restrictive. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will oﬀer a reset around how you communicate and connect, helping you set intentions that support clarity, emotional honesty, and a more grounded inner dialogue. </p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, this week invites you to get clear about what truly holds value in your life. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, your sector of communication, learning, and daily exchanges is activated. Vesta asks you to reflect on how you use your voice, your time, and your attention, especially in conversations, writing, or digital spaces. </p>



<p>As Venus joins Vesta, words carry more warmth and intention, making this a supportive time for meaningful conversations, creative writing, or reconnecting with people who inspire your curiosity. You may feel motivated to share ideas that feel aligned with your values rather than speaking simply to be heard. </p>



<p>At the same time, you’re in the final stretch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Capricorn Season</a>, which has been highlighting your finances, self-worth, and material security. Over the past few weeks, you may have been taking a closer look at how you earn, spend, or define your sense of stability. As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, worries around money or self-esteem can surface, especially if you’ve been pushing yourself to prove your worth. Instead of spiraling, use this moment to rest and reassess. Release financial habits or narratives that feel rooted in fear rather than trust. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th brings an opportunity to reset your relationship with money and self-worth, helping you build a foundation that feels both sustainable and empowering. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, this week may feel quietly significant, like something important is settling into place beneath the surface. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, your sector of finances, values, and self-worth is activated. Vesta asks you to reflect on where your energy, time, and resources have been going, and whether those investments truly align with what you value most. </p>



<p>As Venus joins forces with Vesta, conversations around money, boundaries, and worth can soften, making it easier to advocate for yourself or recognize where you deserve more support, compensation, or appreciation. This is a moment to recommit to value systems that honor both your effort and your humanity. </p>



<p>At the same time, you’re in the final stretch of your season, with the sun, Mercury, Venus, and Mars all having moved through Capricorn. This has likely been an intense period of self-definition, responsibility, and growth, asking you to show up with maturity and resilience. As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, self-doubt, exhaustion, or emotional heaviness can surface, especially around identity or expectations you place on yourself. Rather than pushing through, allow yourself to slow down and release old roles or pressures that no longer fit. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will mark a powerful personal reset, inviting you to set intentions for the next chapter of your life, one rooted in authenticity, self-respect, and a vision of success that truly feels like your own. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, this week feels like a threshold moment, one where your inner world is preparing you for a visible shift. With Vesta entering your sign on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, the spotlight turns inward, asking you to reflect on what you are devoted to on a soul level. Vesta invites you to reconnect with your sense of purpose, identity, and personal integrity, especially around how you show up in relationships and community spaces. </p>



<p>As Venus joins Vesta, self-worth and self-expression soften and expand. You may feel more comfortable being seen, asking for what you want, or prioritizing pleasure and authenticity without guilt. This is a powerful moment for redefining how you relate to yourself before offering energy to others. </p>



<p>At the same time, you are in the final stretch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Capricorn Season</a>, which has been activating your sector of rest, closure, and subconscious patterns. Over the past few weeks, you may have been processing old emotional cycles, burnout, or the need for solitude more deeply than usual. </p>



<p>As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, fatigue, vivid emotions, or the urge to retreat can intensify. Instead of resisting this inward pull, honor it. Rest, unplug, and release habits or narratives that drain your spirit. The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will offer a quiet but potent reset, helping you clear space internally so you can step into your next personal chapter feeling lighter, more grounded, and aligned. </p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, this week encourages you to listen closely to what is stirring beneath the surface. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, your sector of rest, intuition, and behind-the-scenes healing is activated. Vesta asks you to reflect on where your energy has been quietly devoted, especially in ways that may go unseen by others. </p>



<p>As Venus joins forces with Vesta, there’s an opportunity to soften your relationship with solitude, rest, and emotional processing. You may feel drawn to creative reflection, spiritual practices, or simply giving yourself permission to slow down without guilt. This is a powerful moment to tend to your inner world with care and compassion. </p>



<p>At the same time, you’re in the final stretch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Capricorn Season</a>, which has been emphasizing your friendships, community ties, and long-term aspirations. Over the past few weeks, you may have been reassessing which connections feel supportive and which ones feel draining or misaligned. </p>



<p>As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, feelings of isolation, doubt, or emotional heaviness can surface, especially around belonging or your place within a group. Rather than withdrawing completely, allow yourself to observe what these emotions are revealing. Rest, release outdated expectations, and trust that not every connection needs to come with pressure or obligation. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will provide you with a sense of renewal around community and future goals, helping you plant seeds for relationships and dreams that feel both grounded and genuinely nourishing. </p>
