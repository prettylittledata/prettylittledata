The special character of the estate, characterized by old deciduous trees, small detached houses, and an almost village-like atmosphere, despite its proximity to the ICC, can still be clearly felt here. The immediate neighborhood is heterogeneous, combining public buildings such as daycare centers and schools with private single-family homes from different eras. A new residential building has been created in this evolved context, which blends in respectfully and only catches the eye at second glance.</p>",

<h4>How to get production-ready code from AI by structuring Figma file, connecting your design system with Figma MCP, and writing better prompts.</h4><figure><img alt=""Overview of components like toggle, badges, buttons, data visualisation cards, forms and page header from Ivy Design System"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4ecR3i5SgK488SMg3drtIA.png"" /><figcaption>Image by the author, overview of Ivy Design System components</figcaption></figure><p>Right, pull up a chair, grab your coffee. We need to talk about the new team member. They’re brilliant, frankly, work all hours and can write boilerplate code in their sleep. They’re also a bit… literal. This new team member is an AI agent, and it’s changing how we go from design to code.</p><p>But here’s the reality check as <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-2025-ai-report-perspectives/"">Figma’s recent AI report</a> ↗ found that while 68% of developers are using AI to write code, only 32% actually trust the output. The problem isn’t the AI’s ability to write code, it’s the AI’s ability to understand context.</p><p>Now, we could spend a whole other coffee chat talking about how brilliant AI is for spinning up quick interactive prototypes for stakeholders and testing. And, indeed, it’s a valid way to work. But to grow trust in AI to write real, production-ready code, we have to <strong>give it clean data with clear context to work with in the first place.</strong></p><p>So, how does this happen? Until recently, we could only give an AI a screenshot and hope for the best. That’s changing with something called the <a href=""https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro"">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a> ↗. Think of the new Figma MCP server as an interpreter for your Figma files that sends rich, structured information to the LLM. The process looks simple: Figma file → Figma MCP → LLM. But for it to work, every step needs to be packed with meaning. <strong>Simply throwing a prompt and a Figma link at an AI agent and hoping for the best is not going to work.</strong></p><h3>Build foundation in Figma</h3><p>The foundation of any good design-to-code workflow, whether for a human or an AI, is a Figma file that clearly communicates its own intent. Every decision you make in how you structure your file can either bring clarity or create confusion.</p><p>First things first, master your <strong>structure hygiene</strong>. An AI reads your layer tree to understand your design’s structure, so a messy tree leads to a messy DOM. Name everything with purpose. Instead of <em>Frame 74</em>, use names that describe what something <em>is</em> or what it <em>does</em>, like <em>CreateProjectModal</em> or <em>ProjectForm</em>. This directly influences the names of the components and elements the AI generates. While you’re at it, try to keep your structure as flat as possible. Avoid deep, unnecessary nesting. If a group isn’t serving a specific layout purpose, get rid of it. A flatter hierarchy is simply easier for everyone to understand.</p><figure><img alt=""A before-and-after comparison of a Figma layers panel, showing a messy structure with generic names like ‘Frame 79’ being replaced by a clean, semantic structure with names like ‘ProjectForm’ and ‘Group-DateRange"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*81rdmmTMHIezX1y46fuLag.png"" /><figcaption>Image by the author, showing the improvement from generic layer structure to a clean, semantically-named one</figcaption></figure><p>Next<strong> think and build components like a developer </strong>defining their API. Your layer order should reflect the visual hierarchy or, for the web, the DOM order. This is a massive help for accessibility and logical code output.</p><ul><li>Use variants for states like <em>State: Default | Hover | Disabled</em>. This maps directly to CSS pseudo-classes or state props.</li><li>Use a boolean property (Icon: True | False) to show or hide an element. It’s cleaner than separate variants and translates perfectly to a prop like <em>showIcon={true}</em>.</li><li><strong>Use the </strong><a href=""https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/35794667554839-What-s-new-from-Schema-2025#h_01K84PB569NTFMXBDS36C8DCPV""><strong>new slots</strong></a><strong> </strong>↗<strong> feature from Figma to define flexible content areas.</strong> This is a massive improvement over simple instance swaps because it directly maps to the concept of “slots” or the children prop in code.</li></ul><p>Let’s be honest, <strong>Auto Layout</strong> should be your default for almost everything. It’s the clearest way to communicate layout intent. Use absolute positioning sparingly, keeping it for specific cases like notification badges or modal overlays. We’ve all seen the mess that older design-to-code tools made by sprinkling <em>position: absolute</em> everywhere.</p><p>Move beyond primitive names like <em>blue-500</em> and embrace <strong>semantic tokens</strong> that describe purpose. For example, <em>color-button-background-brand</em> tells the AI not just what color this is, but <em>why</em> it exists. This tells the AI <em>why</em> this color exists. <strong>For a masterclass on this, check out t</strong><a href=""https://medium.com/design-systems-collective/when-semantic-tokens-are-no-longer-semantic-d65ef16fadd7""><strong>he article series by Nate Baldwin</strong></a><strong> </strong>↗</p><figure><img alt=""An infographic explaining semantic design tokens. It shows a table where raw hex codes are mapped to base tokens like ‘brand-100’, which are then mapped to purpose-driven semantic tokens like ‘bg-fill/brand/secondary’. The image also includes a diagram of the semantic naming structure and an example of the tokens applied to a UI component."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*B9GJkT08-NHbTWmM3IFquQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author, Visual breakdown of how to move from primitive color values to a purpose-driven semantic token system</figcaption></figure><p>When some context can’t be built, <strong>use Figma’s annotation tools</strong> or plugins like <a href=""https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/859894273811051899/annotate-it""><strong>Annotate It!</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/feed""><strong>↗</strong></a> to explicitly call out interaction details, accessibility requirements, or behavior. These notes will become part of the prompt eventually.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of a Figma component’s annotations that includes details on interaction, development aand accessibility of “_table header cell”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lnEgDXl3h46LV83M0Qy6_Q.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot by the author, demonstrating component annotation in Figma</figcaption></figure><p>While this may feel like a demanding level of detail, this very precision is a huge efficiency gain. <strong>By giving the LLM clear context from your designs, you help it use far fewer tokens to get the right answer.</strong></p><h3>Map designs to codebase</h3><p>The gold standard is to explicitly map designs to code, and creating your own codebase. An AI should consume your existing components, not generate new ones. Without a direct link to your codebase, the AI relies on inaccurate searches that result in redundant code. Tools like <a href=""https://developers.figma.com/docs/figma-mcp-server/code-connect-integration/"">Figma’s Code Connect </a>↗ or third-party integrations with Storybook create this essential link, turning your Figma components into pointers to the real components in your repository.</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of the Code Connect UI feature linking a Figma component to its corresponding React code. Image from the official Figma developer documentation"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*vDBzgtCiML2l4B5cQlmvRw.gif"" /><figcaption>A screenshot of the Code Connect UI feature linking a Figma component to its corresponding React code. Image from the <a href=""https://developers.figma.com/docs/code-connect/code-connect-ui-setup/"">official Figma developer documentation</a></figcaption></figure><h4>But what if you don’t have a codebase yet?</h4><p>You can absolutely use these tools without a connected codebase. The AI will analyze your Figma file and generate new code from scratch that is great for quick prototypes or iterating on ideas. However, understand the trade-offs: you get generated code, not system code; it’s less efficient; and it <strong>creates technical debt that a developer will have to refactor later</strong>.</p><p>A practical middle ground is to <strong>use the AI to create a “scaffold.</strong>” Let it generate the initial components, then treat that output as the first version of your design system’s codebase. From there, you refine it, connect it back to Figma, and build a sustainable system.</p><h3>Extra: The ultimate source of truth with components as data</h3><p>The ultimate source of truth is defining components as structured data (JSON), not as Figma drawings. For a deeper dive into this architectural approach, <a href=""https://medium.com/@nathanacurtis/components-as-data-2be178777f21""><strong>Nathan Curtis’ article “Components as Data”</strong></a> ↗ is an essential read. LLMs thrive on structured data, whereas the standard MCP workflow provides an <em>“incomplete and imprecise”</em> interpretation of your visual design. Tools like the <a href=""https://www.anova.design/""><strong>Anova plugin for Figma</strong></a><strong> </strong>↗ can help you get started. This data-first approach is the future of building AI-ready design systems.</p><h3>Give your AI a “cheat sheet”</h3><p>Whether you’re connecting to code or defining components as data, you still need to guide the AI’s behavior. This involves two skills: writing better prompts and creating a set of rules for the AI to follow. On more in-depth</p><h4>Write context-rich prompts</h4><p>Your prompt is your direct instruction. The more specific, the better.</p><ul><li><strong>Instead of:</strong> “Make this a component.”</li><li><strong>Try:</strong> “Generate a React component for the selected frame using our design system library. Place the new file in src/components/ui/ and name it PricingCard.tsx.”</li></ul><p><strong>Split your work into consumable bites</strong>: the nav bar, then the sidebar, then a content card. If you give them too much at once, AI agents can “choke” on the context and create a mess. Build your UI gradually.</p><h4>Set custom rules</h4><p>While one-off prompts are great for specific tasks, the real power comes from creating a permanent “cheat sheet” that the AI can reference every single time.</p><p>In your project root, create a dedicated folder like <em>.docs/</em> or <em>.ai/.</em> Inside, create your three core rules files: <em>README.md</em> file (for foundational rules), <em>design-system-rules.md</em> (for how to use our components), <em>figma-mcp-rules.md</em> (for the specific Figma MCP workflow).</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Cursor IDE with project structure and particularly dedicated folder for AI rules that incudes README.md, design-system-rules.md, figma-mcp-rules.md files. README.md file is explicitly shown opened"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dGI8HhOgtit-vfgQYv8LOA.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot by the author of Cursor IDE with project structure and dedicated folder for AI rules</figcaption></figure><p>In your IDE settings or at the start of every prompt, you now reference README.md file that instruct the AI on how to use them together.</p><p><strong>README.md<br /></strong>This file acts as the primary entry point. It defines the core tech stack and file structure, and most importantly, it instructs the AI to use the other two files as part of its context.</p><pre># AI Coding Guidelines: <br />This repo uses Figma MCP. For instructions, for styles, mappings and design of components you MUST read and strictly apply the rules from all three of the following files:<br />1.  This `README.md` file (for foundational rules).<br />2.  `design-system-rules.md` (for how to use our components).<br />3.  `figma-mcp-rules.md` (for the specific Figma-to-code process).---<br />## Core Principles &amp; Best Practices<br />- Expert Persona: Act as an expert senior frontend developer writing clean, accessible, and maintainable TypeScript and React.<br />- Accessibility: All components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.<br />- Performance: Optimize for performance. Code should have linear time/space complexity where possible.<br />- Testing: Suggest testable code.<br />---<br />## Core Technologies (React &amp; Tailwind)<br />- Framework: React<br />- Language: TypeScript<br />- Styling:Tailwind CSS, configured via `tailwind.config.js`.<br />---<br />## File Structure &amp; Naming Conventions<br />- Components: Place all new components in `src/components/`.<br />  - Reusable UI Primitives:`src/components/ui/` (e.g., Button, Input).<br />  - Feature-Specific Components: `src/components/feature/` (e.g., `UserProfileCard`).<br />- Component Files: Use PascalCase for filenames. Each component must be in its own folder. (e.g., `src/components/ui/Button/Button.tsx`)<br />- Hooks: Custom hooks go in `src/hooks/` and should be named with the `use` prefix (e.g., `useUserData.ts`).</pre><p><strong>design-system-rules.md<br /></strong>This is the detailed guide on how to correctly use your custom components from your-design-system.</p><pre># Design System Usage Rules<br />This document outlines how to correctly implement components and styles from `your-design-system`.<br />---<br />## Component Architecture &amp; Styling<br />- Design System First: Always use existing components from the `your-design-system` package. Do not rebuild them.<br />- Layout Primitives: Always use layout components from `your-design-system` (e.g., ``, ``). Do not use raw `div`s with custom flexbox CSS.<br />- Styling with Tokens: Use Tailwind utility classes that are configured in our `tailwind.config.js`. Prefer our custom theme utilities (e.g., `bg-brand-primary`) over default Tailwind colors.<br />- Icons: Use the `` component from `your-design-system`, passing the appropriate icon name. Do not import raw SVGs.<br />- Props: Component props must be defined with a TypeScript `interface`.<br />---<br />## What to Avoid<br />- No Hardcoded Values: Do not use hardcoded strings (use translation files), URLs (use config files), or styling values (use tokens).<br />- No Inconsistent Naming: Follow the project's naming conventions.<br />- No Ignoring Errors: Do not ignore TypeScript errors.<br />- No Unnecessary DOM: Avoid unnecessary `div` wrappers.</pre><p><strong>figma-mcp-rules.md<br /></strong>This file is a specific, process-oriented set of instructions for the AI to follow whenever it’s translating a design from Figma.</p><pre># Figma to Code Workflow Rules<br />When generating code from a Figma design, follow this specific process:<br />1.  Get Context First: Run `get_design_context` to fetch the structured representation of the Figma node.<br />2.  Get Visual Reference: Run `get_screenshot` for a visual reference.<br />3.  Implement: Only after you have both, begin implementation.<br />4.

<h4>Turns out, the more feelings in your text, the weirder it feels to let AI touch it.</h4><figure><img alt=""The Ship of Theseus reimagined: a vessel where each wooden plank is replaced with a silicon chip"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MV2D6JbcFgdCKayve-w0rw.png"" /><figcaption>The Ship of Theseus reimagined: a vessel where wooden planks are being replaced with silicon chips. Generated in Sora.</figcaption></figure><p>I use AI writing tools the way most people use spellcheck: casually, constantly, almost without thought. A typo here, a phrasing fix there, a quick “make it flow better.” Over time, it’s become second nature that I write <em>through</em> the machine.</p><p>And that’s not unusual. Grammarly alone reports over <strong>40 million users</strong>, across <strong>50 thousand organizations</strong> and <strong>96 percent of the Fortune 500</strong> (<a href=""https://www.grammarly.com/about"">source: Grammarly.com</a>). The habit has gone mainstream, invisible, automatic, and everywhere.</p><p>But every so often, I pause over a polished paragraph and feel an odd flicker of detachment. The words look like mine, sound like mine, but they’ve passed through <strong>someone else’s hands</strong>. Or circuits. Or whatever metaphor fits. How many edits does it take before the voice that returns isn’t me anymore?</p><p>It’s the Ship of Theseus. Turns out Greek mythology still works in 2025. Swapping planks on a ship is just the new metaphor for rewriting yourself through syntax. Each replaced plank a synonym, each tightened sentence a substitution, until the vessel of thought sails on. The ship, and the writing, are familiar in shape butforeign in soul.</p><p>And this anxiety about “losing your voice” didn’t arrive with ChatGPT. As others have noted, the fear of writing identity slipping away has circulated for years, long before AI became a default tool (see <a href=""https://medium.com/emma-identity/why-loss-of-writing-identity-is-a-myth-and-other-writing-debacles-85fda0b4b046"">Emma Identity’s 2017 essay</a> on textual fingerprints). What’s different now is how automated the erosion feels.</p><h4>A Family-and-Friends Field Test</h4><p>I wanted to understand that uneasy drift between “me” and “machine,” so I ran a small, human-scale test. A handful of volunteers, friends, family, and a few generous redditors who gave five minutes of their lives to a Qualtrics link joined in.</p><figure><img alt=""Flowchart showing participants providing three types of writing (casual text, essay paragraph, code snippet), sending each through an AI tool for ten iterative rewrites, and rating on a 1–7 scale how much the output still felt like “theirs.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ut4rB0gbseUm7BDETSYkoQ.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram of the study procedure: participants wrote a casual text, an essay paragraph, and a code snippet, then passed each piece through an AI tool ten times and rated how much the rewritten text still felt like their own. Original illustration by the author.</figcaption></figure><p>Each person worked across three familiar modes: a casual text, a short essay paragraph, and a code snippet. They wrote something genuine, then passed it through an AI writer of their choice ten times in a row. After each iteration, they rated it on a 1–7 scale: <strong>“How much is this still mine?”</strong></p><p>The survey itself ran on Qualtrics; I cleaned and visualized the data in R, using a simple mixed-effects model to trace how that sense of ownership decayed over time. Everyone consented, all responses were anonymized, and what’s shown here reflects only the aggregate picture.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tsdSUozOICLkG9w_oCeT-w.png"" /><figcaption>Perceived ownership steadily declines with each AI rewrite, dropping fastest for texting and slowest for code.</figcaption></figure><p>Turns out, the ownership ratings <strong>fell off a cliff</strong> around the third or fourth rewrite for texting and essay writing, but held surprisingly steady in code. A spline model (R, lme4, three-knot natural spline) showed the steepest drop early on: texting collapsed fastest, essays followed, code barely flinched.</p><p>By the numbers:</p><ul><li><strong>Texting:</strong> sharpest drop of –1.4 points around iteration 3.</li><li><strong>Essay:</strong> a slower, smaller decline (–1.25 points near iteration 5).</li><li><strong>Code:</strong> almost no falloff (–0.3 points around iteration 4).</li></ul><p>When asked when their text felt “more AI than me” (below a 4 on the 1–7 scale), people hit that midpoint at <strong>iteration 3 for texting</strong>, <strong>iteration 7 for essays</strong>, and <strong>never</strong> for code.</p><p>This aligns with a broader cultural confusion around what “human-written” even looks like. As <a href=""https://alpace.medium.com/unless-it-was-written-by-ryan-holiday-it-was-probably-written-by-ai-0b7099516d98"">Aaron Pace</a> recently wrote, the more polished a piece of writing is, the more likely AI detectors are to label it “machine-made.” Today we see a strange modern reversal where professionalism now reads as artificial. My data shows the inverse feeling: the messier and more intimate the writing, the more its owner wants to keep machines out.</p><h4>What the Humans Said</h4><p>After the survey, I spoke with a few participants again, some over Zoom, some across a kitchen table. Their reactions lined up quite cleanly with the numbers. <strong>The more personal the writing, the more wrong it felt to let an AI touch it.</strong></p><p>When it came to texting, everyone hesitated. That space is messy and intimate. You’d use lowercase shorthand, inside jokes, typos, emojis that say more than syntax ever could. Watching an AI rewrite that kind of message felt invasive, like handing your phone to someone else mid-conversation.</p><p>Essay writing was easier to surrender. Participants said it felt “professional,” “detached,” something meant to be polished anyway. The AI’s edits felt like a second pair of eyes rather than a replacement of self.</p><p>And code, unless you were a computer science student who lives in it, wasn’t personal at all. In fact, most people said they <em>needed</em> AI to even get started, describing the help as “welcome,” “expected,” or “honestly, a relief.” For them, authorship was more functional than emotional. The machine wasn’t rewriting their voice, it was scaffolding their logic.</p><p>One person linked their experience to the idea of <strong>vibe coding</strong><em>, </em>which, as <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/vibe-coding"">an IBM article described</a>, is <em>the emerging practice of writing code by talking to AI using natural language prompts instead of lines of syntax</em>. They acknowledged that software engineers often dismiss it as unserious, even lazy, but for them, it was liberating. As a non–computer science student, they said vibe coding made the process less intimidating and more creative.</p><p>It echoed something <a href=""https://medium.com/contemplate/chatgpt-grammarly-and-hemingway-walked-into-a-bar-de2fa481022f"">Jasmine McCandless</a> captured: people don’t pick the “best” writing tool, they pick the one that demands the least effort. But effort can manifest in many ways. And one of them is emotional risk. In my study, the more personal the writing, the more people resisted AI intervention. Once the task shifted into professional or functional territory, the comfort gap widened and AI quietly became the low-effort choice.</p><figure><img alt=""A person giving a robot directions on what to write"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7PDMmFtdCzfA4b_6caHVuA.png"" /><figcaption>Collaboration between a human writer and an AI assistant. Original illustration by the author.</figcaption></figure><h4>Takeaways for UX Design</h4><p>The tension here is becoming infrastructural. <a href=""https://epiren.medium.com/trust-verify-and-write-using-grammarlys-authorship-in-the-age-of-ai-1778e015dea0"">René Najera</a> recently wrote about Grammarly’s new Authorship feature, which records your keystrokes and generates a replay of how a document came together. Their point is simple: in an age of ubiquitous AI tools, writers now feel pressure not only to produce authentic work, but to <em>prove</em> they made it. My findings speak to the same impulse from the user side: authorship isn’t just who typed the words, but how much of the process still feels human, intentional, and personally owned.</p><p>Maybe the real product insight here is that Grammarly should just buy Copilot and call it a day. One interface to smooth every sentence, human or machine. Beneath the joke, though, is a deeper cue for design: people’s comfort with AI assistance scales with emotional distance.</p><p>Texting felt intimate, messy, and human. That’s where participants pulled back. They didn’t want the machine polishing what was meant to be personal. Essay writing lived in the middle zone, where improvement feels professional rather than invasive. Code, on the other hand, was almost depersonalized; help there felt efficient, not existential.</p><p>The takeaway isn’t to build less AI assistance. It’s to build <strong>context-aware</strong> assistance. In spaces where expression carries identity (e.g., messages, creative writing, voice) AI needs to step lightly, amplifying rather than rewriting. In functional spaces such as emails, documentation, and code, it can take the wheel without moral friction.</p><p>Designing for this gradient of intimacy means giving users <strong>control over how much authorship they’re willing to trade</strong>. The future of AI writing UX isn’t about raw capability. It’s about sensitivity: knowing when to finish your sentence, and when to leave your typos alone.</p><p>In practice, this could look like:</p><ul><li><strong>Surface adjustable “AI intensity” controls directly in writing surfaces.</strong><br />Let users slide between light-touch suggestions (“fix punctuation only”) and heavier rewrites (“rewrite for clarity”).</li><li><strong>Use mode-aware defaults.</strong><br />If the system detects texting-like language (emojis, slang, rapid back-and-forth), default to minimal intervention. For structured writing (docs, reports, code blocks), default to more active assistance.</li><li><strong>Show the </strong>Δ<strong><em>delta</em> , not just the final rewrite.</strong><br />Display what was changed and why. Visible authorship boundaries reduce the feeling of being overwritten.</li><li><strong>Offer reversible, granular edits.</strong><br />Let users accept or reject changes at the sentence or phrase level, rather than forcing an all-or-nothing rewrite.</li><li><strong>Preserve voice automatically.</strong><br />Train style models on the user’s past writing and ensure AI edits mimic that tone rather than flattening it.</li><li><strong>Avoid “dominant tone” suggestions in intimate spaces.</strong><br />Don’t push “professional tone,” “confident tone,” or “assertive tone” suggestions inside chat or messaging contexts. It reads as intrusive.</li><li><strong>Let users lock sentences or paragraphs.</strong><br />If a line feels emotionally important or identity-revealing, users can mark it: “don’t rewrite this.”</li><li><strong>Respect the emotional labor of writing.</strong><br />When edits touch personal content, frame them as support (“Want help clarifying this?”) rather than replacement (“Here’s a better version”).</li></ul><p>There’s an <a href=""https://medium.com/technology-hits/why-your-niche-is-your-shield-the-types-of-writing-ai-struggles-to-replace-dad50e79a01c"">argument</a> that emotionally grounded writing acts as a kind of “shield” that AI can’t easily penetrate, the kind of work rooted in lived experience, personal history, or emotional nuance that resists mechanization by its very nature. And maybe that’s the point: the parts of writing that matter most aren’t the ones AI can smooth; they’re the ones only a human can feel.</p><p><em>Alice Ji is a PhD researcher at UIUC’s Institute of Communications Research, studying digital persuasion, attention, and interface design.

When Leslie Knope (played by Amy Poehler) decided to run for City council in season 4, she does so with her friends running every aspect of her campaign (after being let go by “official” campaign managers), this gives her campaign an approachable, friendly and personal aspect that eventually led to her victory.</p><p>Although specific names of the entire Mamdani’s campaign team are not extensively detailed in publicly available sources, it is known that the campaign operated with a community-driven approach characterized by deep community roots, and a decentralized yet well-coordinated volunteer network, with digital and field teams working closely to listen, test, and refine the outreach based on real-time input from voters.</p><figure><img alt=""Photograph of Zohran Mamdani speaking at a Fix the MTA press conference.

The answer lies in principles every UX designer should understand but while keeping in mind questions of power, authenticity, and manipulation in digital spaces.</blockquote><p><a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/user-experience-politics-how-ux-can-be-applied-to-political-campaigns-4efe25435846"">Brad O’Conner</a> who transitioned into UX design after 15 years in political consulting, discovered that he had been practicing UX design principles in political campaigns long before transitioning into the field, writes &quot;The voters whom you are trying to reach are the users. The goal is to provide the voter with relevant information so that their decision to vote for your candidate or cause is made more accessible.”</p><blockquote><strong><em>One key difference is that politics is also a lot more “manipulative” than UX.</em></strong></blockquote><p>A study carried out by the <a href=""https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-01-13-social-media-manipulation-political-actors-industrial-scale-problem-oxford-report"">Oxford Internet Institute</a> that documented organized social media manipulation campaigns in 81 countries, found that “governments and political parties “produced misinformation on an industrial scale.” So as designers we must ask, <em>where does authentic transparency end and performance begin?</em></p><h3>1. Active listening as user testing</h3><p>Mamdani’s campaign broke from the traditional political playbook by engaging directly with both supporters and critics on social media.</p><h4>The “ultimately” moment: iteration made visible</h4><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/reel/DMBjabdOTPe/"">Zohran Kwame Mamdani on Instagram: &quot;I was given an ultimatum.&quot;</a></p><p><em>Alt text: Video of Zohran Mamdani catching himself mid-sentence about to say “ultimately” and self-correcting with humor</em> <em>Video credit: Zohran Mamdani Instagram / Original creator</em></p><p>In one instance from July 2025, Zohran Mamdani, prompted by feedback from his communications team and voters, makes a conscious effort to stop himself from overusing the word “ultimately” during interviews and public appearances. In this light-hearted video, Mamdani acknowledges the feedback, shares clips illustrating his habit, and includes a segment where — mid-sentence — he catches himself about to say “ultimately” and quickly redirects his phrasing.</p><blockquote><em>“I am listening, I am learning. Please keep sending me your feedback because ultimately, I will get better.”<br />“In response to my team and supporters pointing out that I say ‘ultimately’ a lot, I caught myself on camera correcting the habit. Keep holding me accountable. This is how we improve, together.” (Zohran Mamdani)</em></blockquote><p>This approach mirrors what the <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/empathy-mapping/"">Nielsen Norman Group teaches about design thinking</a>: empathy mapping helps “distill and categorize your knowledge of the user into one place” and “discover gaps in your current knowledge.” Mamdani essentially created a public empathy map of his own communication style, inviting collective feedback.</p><figure><img alt=""The User-Centered Design Loop: Mamdani’s Campaign as a Design Process.

Building trust through transparency</h3><p>Mamdani’s response embraced feedback as a tool for self-improvement much like designers should seek out feedback and build on it in order to inspire trust in their designs. Furthermore, the transparency in documenting the process of listening and acknowledging the feedback is what inspired people’s trust in him. This moment, in equal parts humorous and earnest, embodies the essence of user-driven iteration.</p><blockquote><strong><em>However</em></strong><em>, a question we, as designers, must ask ourselves is, how do we distinguish genuine transparency from performed authenticity? The Mamdani campaign appears to represent authentic engagement, and although their strategies are effective, they can also easily be replicated by good actors with bad intentions.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Lessons for designers</em></strong><em>: Find the line between authentic iteration and manipulative performance and listen to your users, show them you’re paying attention, and let the process of improvement happen in public view.</em></blockquote><h3>3. Small, agile teams win</h3><p>Mamdani did not have the funding for a large campaign nor was he backed by any billionaires. According to the official <a href=""https://www.nyccfb.info/vsapps/CandidateSummary.aspx?as_cand_id=2899&amp;as_election_cycle=2025&amp;cand_name=Mamdani"">campaign finance summary</a> from the New York City Campaign Finance Board for the 2025 election cycle, Zohran Mamdani’s total campaign spending was $12,794,272. His campaign raised $17,159,487 in total receipts, with over $4 million coming from private funds and significant additional support from public funds through matching programs. This is relatively lean compared to Cuomo’s 40 million dollar budget which mostly came from super PACs and billionaire donors. Unlike Cuomo’s traditional campaign operation, Mamdani relied on volunteers and a handful of core personnel to constantly iterate and connect at the ground level.</p><h4>Here’s how an agile approach played out in practice:</h4><ul><li><strong>Culturally aware content</strong>: Mamdani’s team highlighted community through moments like salsa dancing in Bronx parks, sharing biryani with cabbies, or joining Tai Chi classes in Flushing. These resonated with the voters and quickly turned viral.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Collage of eight campaign photos showing Zohran Mamdani at diverse community events including large crowd gatherings, group photos with supporters on steps and on motorcycles, media appearances on MSNBC Weekend, indoor community meetings, a Congresswoman Yvette Clarke endorsement poster, and candid moments speaking with constituents in outdoor settings Source: https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*l4oBSYa9PKgbsRxCViYHDg.png"" /><figcaption>Collage of Mamdani at community events.

These partnerships came together quickly, built on DMs and group chats rather than formal contracts.</li><li><strong>Volunteer-led feedback loops</strong>: The campaign harnessed a decentralized WhatsApp-powered network of volunteers for canvassing, “friendraisers,” and “house parties.” First-time volunteers were rapidly trained and empowered to experiment, suggesting new neighborhoods to target, new stories to tell, and even filming spontaneous street interviews. This grassroots network was not only executing, but also feeding real-time insights and inspiration back to the campaign’s creative leads.</li><li><strong>Prototyping at campaign speed</strong>: from valentine’s day skits to a CTA in a box of chocolates, to working with rising and diverse artists like Aneesh Bhoopathy (whose branding drew from New York’s multicultural cityscapel), Wael Morcos of Morcos Key (who brought an Arabic inflection to the design for outreach in immigrant communities) and Rama Duwaji (Mamdani’s wife) a Syrian-American artist, all contributed creative input to the campaign’s bold color palette and storytelling style. Together, these collaborators crafted a visual system that embodied the campaign’s ethos: energetic, multicultural, and community-rooted.</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/554/1*-cHRq1W7oDToc9LlXLl85g.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qP_poKjabd5DdbvWcCKONg.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/538/1*n8JGlCWyY_n831nkV_arRQ.png"" /><figcaption>Campaign poster designs.

Social media engagement and message clarity</h3><p>If social media was meant for anything it was storytelling. This is exemplified in Mamdani’s social media campaigning, he didn’t just tell a story, he listened to other people’s stories.</p><h4><strong>Near real-time responsiveness</strong></h4><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/reel/DQrrenCDtrg/"">Zohran Kwame Mamdani on Instagram: &quot;Thank you, New York City.

When he won the mayoral race, influencers joked that Mamdani should “go to bed” as the very next day Mamdani posted a video announcing his plan for the transitional phase.</p><p>Digital experts credited his social media presence with fueling grassroots participation at levels rarely seen in local politics. Mamdani did not simply use social media he was intertwined in its roots through collaboration with influencers he knew would target his voters and his audience, that’s good user research: <em>know your audience</em>.</p><p>This engagement and real-time communication transcended boundaries and was embraced far beyond its original audience because it told a story and stories have no borders.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Lessons for designers</em></strong><em>: Storytelling as a tool in UX is often overlooked and under-appreciated, yet it is at the center of good UX and UI.

Clarity as empowerment</h3><p>Other than the consistent and constant social media messaging and presence, the likes of which have never been seen in US political campaigning, Zohran Mamdani’s message was committed to clarity. On social media and in real life, whether he was explaining voting requirements, or his plans as mayor for the city, he was walking people step-by-step through the message and in multiple languages and settings thereby empowering first-time or previously disengaged voters.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Lessons for designers</em></strong><em>: Mamdani’s approach exemplified the core UX principle of affordance: making it immediately visible what action is possible and how to take it.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>However</em></strong><em>, the question then arises, </em>Why should anyone have to explain the ability and process of voting?<em> Doesn’t this then allow those with the explanation the power to weaponize this knowledge? </em><a href=""https://ask.edgarallan.com/blog/a-ux-perspective-on-the-us-election""><em>Edgar Allan’s UX team notes</em></a><em>, “If there was ever a thing that should be unquestionably clear, understandable and accessible, it is the ability to vote. Unfortunately, the U.S. voting system suffers from a distinct lack of user-centricity.”</em></blockquote><h3>6. Cultural pain points = empathy mapping</h3><p>One of the first steps in the design thinking process is to empathize. Empathy was the main message throughout Mamdani’s campaign, it “goes beyond what users explicitly state and manages to unearth hidden motivations, desires, and pain points.” (<a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/empathy-map-why-and-how-to-use-it"">Interaction Design Foundation</a>).</p><p><em>By focusing on lived experiences, cultural nuances and specific community needs his campaign resonated with voters in an unprecedented way.</em></p><p>In a historic move not seen before in American politics, Mamdani publicly asked his supporters to stop donating once the campaign reached its financial goals. He posted transparent breakdowns of fundraising progress and, upon reaching the spending cap, communicated directly:</p><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/reel/DOOI8_Ijrm5/"">Zohran Kwame Mamdani on Instagram: &quot;I am once again asking you to stop sending us money. But we do need your time. Comment CanvassNow - one word, no spaces - to get a sign up link in your DMs.&quot;</a></p><p><em>Alt text: Video of Mamdani asking voters to stop donating money to his campaign.

Redirect your generosity to mutual aid, to neighbors, to other grassroots causes.” (Zohran Mamdani)</blockquote><h4><strong>Plain language, clear needs</strong></h4><p>There were no hidden motives or complicated political lingo, just a plain-language presentation of what he needed from his supporters at each moment. Voting instructions were step-by-step. Donation limits were openly discussed. When the campaign reached its fundraising goal, supporters were told explicitly and publicly that there was no need for more underlying the empathetic line that his campaign had been running “For a New York You Can Afford”.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Lessons for designers</em></strong><em>: make empathy visible by listening, responding, and adapting your design to users’ actual lives and constraints.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Here again we must consider the power of manipulation and exploitation.</em></strong><em> When genuine empathy certainly bridges gaps, but when performed it can manipulate vulnerable populations. Our responsibility, as designers is to ensure empathy serves users’ interests, not just campaign goals, to quote </em><a href=""https://uxpamagazine.org/political-design/""><em>Lloyd Hervey writes about Political Design</em></a><em>, designers must consider “what is possible and what is ethical…the trade-offs of who will benefit from a particular solution versus who will be negatively affected.”</em></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Instagram post by Zohran Mamdani promoting a “Savings Calculator” tool for New York City residents.

Multilingual communication = inclusive design</h3><p>Some political opponents criticized Mamdani for “code switching”, shifting languages and communication styles to match his audience. But in UX terms, this is exactly right. Code switching isn’t diluting your message; it’s adapting it for different user contexts.</p><h4><strong>Authentic voices from communities</strong></h4><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/reel/DQZrQz4jtFm/"">Zohran Kwame Mamdani on Instagram: &quot;Juntos vamos a construir la ciudad que merecemos! Y con tu ayuda, voy a seguir aprendiendo español 😉 ¡Puedes votar temprano hasta el Domingo y el día de las elecciones es el Martes 4 de Noviembre! ¡Comenta con la palabra VOTA y te enviaremos un enlace para ver dónde votar!&quot;</a></p><p><em>Alt text: Video of Mamdani speaking Spanish with a local Spanish speaking voter. Video credit: Zohran Mamdani Instagram</em></p><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/reel/DQhue5vjlgj/"">Zohran Kwame Mamdani on Instagram‎: &quot;‏أنا اسمي زهران ممدان وعم رشّح حالي لأكون العمدة الجديد في مدينة نيويورك&quot;‎</a></p><p><em>Alt text: Video of Mamdani speaking Arabic. Video credit: Zohran Mamdani Instagram</em></p><p>Mamdani’s socials are flooded with videos in Arabic, Urdu, Spanish, appealing to all the New York demographics and communities. He did so by enlisting the help of people from those communities, in other words he engaged with more diverse audiences thoughtfully and used locals to help make his message more authentic and relevant. This helped communities feel seen and heard and Mamdani was able to build trust with communities small and large.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Lessons for designers</em></strong><em>: use language fluidity to engage broader, more diverse audiences thoughtfully and do not translate blindly, instead ellicit help from locals who speak the language. S</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Such help from local communities should go beyond translation and requires including the diverse communioties in the design process itself and not just in the final messaging. Language fluidity is not automatically inclusive and as designers we must be weary of what researchers call “</em>performative diversity<em>” which is looking inclusive without transferring actual power to marginalized communities</em></blockquote><h3>Conclusion</h3><h4>Hope through human-centered design</h4><p>Mamdani’s campaign gave people something special and new (perhaps also dangerous, it remains to be seen): Hope.</p><p>He did it by embodying core UX principles: <em>empathy</em>, <em>storytelling</em>, and <em>iteration</em>. His message was always empathetic, his statements clear and direct, and his “user requirements” (what he needed from his supporters) consistently open and accessible. This was a campaign led by the people, for the people, but more importantly, Mamdani didn’t position himself as someone observing New Yorkers from the outside. He is a New Yorker. He lived their stories alongside them, not above them.</p><h4>Remembering the human element and our responsibility as designers.</h4><p>As designers, it’s all too easy to get caught up in technical features or aesthetic appeal. While those things matter, the most meaningful work happens when we remember the element of humanity at the heart of every experience. As the UX world shifts rapidly, perhaps toward “Zero UI” where interfaces recede and experience comes to the foreground, we should focus on listening deeply, telling better stories, and designing platforms where users’ stories are welcomed, valued, and allowed to live and breathe.</p><p>But we must also remember our ethical responsibility; feelings give way to manipulation and exploitation, and the same techniques that built hope in Mamdani’s campaign can and are also used to to spread misinformation, manipulate vulnerable populations, and erode democratic institutions. Our work as designers is never neutral, after all design for everyone is design for no one, and the question is not whether our design has impact, but whether that impact serves democratic values, human dignity, and truth.</p><p>Mamdani’s campaign was a reminder that empathy, clarity, and authentic connection are what build hope and inspire change. But it’s also a reminder that these tools are powerful, and that with great power comes great responsibility.</p><blockquote>The future of design in democracy depends on our willingness to hold two simultaneous truths: that connection matters deeply, and that not all connection is created equal.</blockquote><p>Every design decision is a choice. Choose wisely.</p><h3>References and Additional Readings</h3><h4><strong>Campaign Coverage:</strong></h4><ul><li>Wikipedia. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_New_York_City_mayoral_election"">“2025 New York City mayoral election.”</a></li><li>Adweek. <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/agencies/meet-melted-solids-the-scrappy-agency-behind-zohran-mamdanis-primary-winning-campaign/"">“Meet Melted Solids, the Scrappy Agency Behind Zohran Mamdani’s Primary-Winning Campaign.”</a></li><li>New York Times. <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/11/05/nyregion/nyc-mayor-mamdani"">“Mamdani, N.Y.C.

<h4>A guide to the extinction of user joy in the digital age.</h4><figure><img alt=""Image of a crab over a phone, symbolizing the evolution of apps into ad machines"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Yarbt8n6ZoCN7HwRnRAJHg.png"" /><figcaption>An crap shaped ad, emerging from a cellphone.</figcaption></figure><p>I was halfway through doing the dishes while listening to a podcast when an ad cut through and interrupted one of the most interesting bits. My phone was a few meters away in the living room and I rushed over like I had forgotten a burning turkey in the oven to make sure that I got to the phone before the second ad started playing. I tapped that lower-right hand skip button and the tension in my body temporarily melted away as I made my way back to the chore and continued listening to my podcast, ironically about the slow decay of once useful apps, that was so rudely interrupted by a Nissan ad.</p><figure><img alt=""Popup for YouTube Premium offering ad free experience"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/661/0*qVaAxIWg4nrXMgaT.jpg"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://strangershow.com/how-to-buy-youtube-premium/"">Popup for YouTube Premium offering ad free experience</a></figcaption></figure><p>As I pondered how possible it would be to find an ad blocker for my phone, the answer was slapped in my face in the form of a glorious popup! <strong>Try YouTube premium and you’ll be ad free</strong>… something that only a few years ago was standard had become a premium and I asked myself why? The term I happened to be learning about that day from <a href=""https://doctorow.medium.com/https-pluralistic-net-2024-04-04-teach-me-how-to-shruggie-kagi-caaa88c221f2"">Cory Doctorow was <strong>enshittification</strong></a>, which can be loosely defined as the process by which platforms decay as they shift value away from users and toward themselves and their business customers. In other words, things start out good for us, then get worse as the companies optimize for profit. While we all have a collective <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/"">intuitive sense of platforms decaying</a> over the last few years, I wanted to look closer from a design perspective, specifically, at how that decay unfolds through the deliberate, incremental rollout of ads.</p><p>The key players in this <strong>enshittification</strong> race are the four major tech companies that dominate our digital lives: Google, Meta (Facebook and Instagram), TikTok, and YouTube. But for the sake of this article, I’m going to focus on one in particular, because it’s where I spend the most time: YouTube.</p><p>These companies’ slow decay into ad infested dystopian nightmares reminded me of a conversation I had with my good friend and cofounder <a href=""https://charliegedeon.medium.com/"">Charlie Gedeon</a>. He told me about this theory, called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinisation""><strong>carcinisation</strong></a>, which is the very hilarious scientific process which can be described as “<a href=""https://brill.com/view/journals/ctoz/67/2/article-p79_1.xml"">the many attempts of Nature to evolve [into] a crab</a>”. In simple terms, there is an evolutionary momentum that has slowly pushed a variety of unrelated species to evolve into the general behaviour pattern and shape of a crab. So given enough time and opportunity, every species will eventually become a crab. I couldn’t ignore the metaphorical parallel: in our technological ecosystem, the biggest species don’t turn into crabs, they turn into ads.</p><p>Before YouTube, there was TV. The TV was invented in 1939, and the <a href=""https://www.madhive.com/insights/history-of-tv-advertising"">first ads were shown in 1941</a>. In the early 1940s, ads were short, mild interruptions between programs then by the 1980s, they had become pretty much the reason every sitcom, news broadcast, and sports event existed at all. It was simply the packaging for the ad breaks that paid for it. Then streaming arrived and it felt like a breath of fresh air! A new, ad-free subspecies breaking free from its commercial ancestors. Netflix, YouTube, and early Hulu gave us hope of a new evolutionary path: content without interruption. But, it didn’t stay ad free for long.</p><p>So let’s look at YouTube, starting with the first signs of life to crawl out of the primordial soup, we have the humble <a href=""https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/66159/"">InVideo overlays first launched in 2007</a>, these were thin, semi-transparent banners that floated over the bottom of a playing video, usually small text or a tiny ad image that you could close with a small “X.” These early ads didn’t stop the video, or call for too much attention. They quietly fed on our attention without killing us, like a parasitic symbiosis. While annoying, they didn’t destabilize the delicate environment of early to mid-2000’s YouTube.</p><figure><img alt=""The early dismissible youtube ad banner showing at the bottom 20% of the screen"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*QMeV9fQYXmh-XYNo.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://setupad.com/blog/youtube-ad-formats-guide/"">Early dismissible youtube ad banner taking up the bottom 20% of a video.</a></figcaption></figure><p>Then between 2010 and 2018 there’s an explosion of life, the ads grow legs, lungs, and teeth… YouTube launched <a href=""https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/trueview-video-ads-give-viewers-choice/"">TrueView ads</a>, those aforementioned and all too familiar skippable pre-rolls that appear before your chosen video. These ads demand visibility, they evolved to study their prey’s habits, tracking which openings held attention longest. At first, there was just one, small but intrusive, a 5-second interaction before you could skip and move on. But as we all know, evolution rewards persistence. Soon, a single ad became two, then a pair before and after your video, and finally in 2012, <a href=""https://blog.youtube/creator-and-artist-stories/mid-roll-ads-updates-explained"">mid-roll ads appeared</a>, splitting your entertainment in bite size chunks.</p><figure><img alt=""Showing the skipable after X number of seconds ad at the beginning of a video"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ZSukJyjEmxwlLrTt.jpg"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://setupad.com/blog/youtube-ad-formats-guide/"">Showing the skipable after X number of seconds ad at the beginning of a video</a></figcaption></figure><p>With each mutation, they became harder and harder to ignore. The variety was overwhelming, displaying banners above, overlays below, and videos within videos. The content creators themselves now, mimicking the copy of the ads. By the end of this period, the once teeming with life content creator ecosystem had turned into a chewed through rotting swamp where every spare patch of attention was colonized with a swarm of ads.</p><p>Understandably, this environment was not the most pleasant so I, like many others, used an ad-block. To put in perspective how prevalent this problem is, here’s a quote from Cory Doctorow that really struck me: <a href=""https://youtu.be/P1EKQidRooc?si=W5D9-f7NSy8VVT3I&amp;t=1372"">“51% of web users have installed an ad blocker, it is literally the largest consumer boycott in human history.”</a> The majority of people, which I imagine probably encompasses people making these decisions in the first place, probably have an ad blocker installed. This was our one tool to try and avoid the onslaught of ads that we’d be subjected to on a daily basis, and while there weren’t as easily accessible tools on mobile, we’d at least have a reprieve on our computers… or so we thought.</p><figure><img alt=""YouTube rollout of the ad blocker warning popups, showing that Ad Blockers aren’t allowed on the platform."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/690/0*zH9j2L6vBUyKB43D.jpeg"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://community.brave.app/t/youtube-showing-popup-for-ad-blockers/511149"">YouTube rollout of the ad blocker warning popups</a></figcaption></figure><p>In late <a href=""https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-ad-blocker-crackdown-growing-3380809"">May of 2023</a>, YouTube began to mutate again, starting with a small subset of tests where they rolled out banners saying “Ad Blockers are not allowed on YouTube.” An easily dismissable popup asking you to uninstall your Ad Blocker. It was the early signs of a dominant species that was going to make it impossible for you to avoid ads. Eventually, making it an unfeasible arms race between ad-blockers and ad-blocker-blockers (that’s a mouthful). This persisted to where we’re at now where it’s more of a pain to find a way to circumvent ads then to just sit through the discomfort that we’ve been conditioned to endure.</p><p>This whole process has been a calculated and heavily studied rollout. In some ways it is a masterful example of how to slowly introduce a feature to users that doesn’t actually benefit the majority. At first users feel discomfort, but not enough to abandon the platform. The designers, researchers and tech CEO’s know that they’re pushing unpleasantness and that they have to go as far as they can without causing too much pain because they understand that it’s a delicate ecosystem of attention and people will find alternatives if pushed too far too quickly. If YouTube had not given notice of its intention to block ads for months prior to the rollout of the full ad-block extinction, what would have happened? I personally think the consequences would have been cataclysmic and in some ways hoped that they would have torn off the bandaid a little more violently to shock us into action.</p><p>So over the course of 25 years, they’ve increased the heat and now we’re in a pot of boiling water, but in truth it’s we actually don’t know how much hotter it might get. Many <strong>PAID</strong> platforms now include ads, such as Prime and you have to pay additional fees to exclude them. So what comes next in this grand evolutionary chain? Maybe ads that blend seamlessly into the content, AI-generated sponsorships that mimic the creator’s voice so perfectly we can’t tell where the video ends and the commercial begins. Maybe they’ll feel like features instead of intrusions. Either way, the species isn’t going extinct anytime soon. Like crabs, like capitalism, ads always find a way.</p><p>The hope is for the next disruption. YouTube once broke the cable monopoly with creativity, and community before slowly mutating into the very thing it replaced. It would seem, that’s the pattern of evolution, the old ecosystem collapses under its own weight, and something new crawls out of the primordial muck.</p><p>One can hope that there is a better answer gestating. Maybe it’s decentralized video, maybe it’s a new model of sharing that doesn’t depend on monetized attention, more than likely it’s something we haven’t imagined yet. The godfather of the term, <a href=""https://doctorow.medium.com/"">Cory Doctorow</a>, explores this in his new book <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222615930-enshittification""><em>Enshittification: Why Everything Suddenly Got Worse and What to Do About It</em> </a>, with the most important part being that final clause: <strong>what to do about it.</strong></p><p>As citizens, we can advocate for antitrust laws, interoperability, and policies that prevent platforms from locking in both users and creators. As users, we can choose to support the smaller, values-driven platforms that still have a soul, ones that remind us the internet doesn’t have to be stinky pile of ads, but a place we actively connect. And lastly as designers, we can embed the values of portability, transparency, user control, and minimal hidden value extraction.

<h4>How to translate philosophical theory into practical design principles and responsibility.</h4><figure><img alt=""Colorful circular diagram titled “Ethical Interface Design” with sections: Inclusion, Privacy, Autonomy, Transparency, Well-Being, each linked to ethical theories."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gm8743DS4GxpcGXJdywN2g.jpeg"" /></figure><p>The following article introduces an evolving academic framework called <em>Ethical Interface Design</em>, which examines how moral philosophy can guide interface design in the era of emerging technologies. The working site, <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com""><strong>ethicalinterface.com</strong></a>, presents these ideas through a minimalist, text-focused layout that intentionally prioritizes thought over visuals — a meta-commentary on where design itself may be heading. The framework remains in active development, and thoughtful feedback is welcome.</p><p>Society is moving beyond screens into conversational, immersive, and neural experiences, placing designers at the center of the ethical landscape of human–technology interaction. <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/""><em>Ethical Interface Design</em></a> helps designers understand not only the impact of their choices but also the ethical frameworks behind them, exploring:</p><ul><li>How interfaces influence behavior across visual, tactile, conversational, neural, and mixed-reality modalities</li><li>The philosophical roots of <em>Ethical Interface Design</em> — inclusion, autonomy, privacy, transparency, and well-being</li><li>The trade-offs between competing moral frameworks — such as egalitarianism versus meritocracy, or collectivism versus libertarianism — that determine how ethical priorities are balanced in design</li><li>Practical guidance for applying ethics to real-world projects</li></ul><p><em>Ethical Interface Design</em> equips designers to make intentional, responsible choices as they shape the digital world ahead.</p><h3>Interface Modalities</h3><p>Every interface mediates the relationship between humans and machines — translating intention into action, and in doing so, shaping how we perceive, decide, and connect. Emerging technologies such as <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models"">large language models</a> and <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6914248/"">neural chips</a> are expanding that relationship, blurring the boundary between user and system. As interfaces grow more adaptive and conversational, the very definition of “user interface design” begins to dissolve — replaced by fluid exchanges that merge cognition, language, and computation.</p><p>This evolution raises profound questions about agency, inclusion, and moral responsibility — questions explored further in the Ethical Foundations and <em>The Five Pillars of Ethical Interface Design</em> section of this article.</p><h4>From Command to Conversation</h4><p>Early computing relied on text-based <a href=""https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_cli.asp"">command-line interfaces</a> — precise but exclusive, accessible only to those fluent in code. The 1980s introduced the <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/graphical-user-interfaces?srsltid=AfmBOorkkBsRT2lPaE0zQed3OJt5HT3hCRkelHQF4-T-KQ_riqUiSau2"">Graphical User Interface (GUI)</a>, popularized by Xerox PARC and Apple, replacing syntax with icons and windows. This visual paradigm made computing public but also aestheticized control — what you could see, you could do.</p><p>As technology spread beyond the desktop, new modalities emerged. Touchscreens redefined tactility. Voice assistants reintroduced conversation. Gesture and neural systems now blur the line between intention and execution. Each step expanded access while also raising new ethical questions about consent, surveillance, and cognitive autonomy.</p><h4>Types of Interfaces</h4><p>Interfaces are the boundaries between human intention and digital response. They manifest through the senses and combinations of them — and increasingly through language itself in conversational systems.</p><ul><li><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/visual-design-in-ux-study-guide/""><strong>Visual Interfaces</strong></a> → Screens, icons, and layouts that communicate through sight. Examples include smartphone apps, operating systems, dashboards, and AI applications that blend visual and conversational interaction.</li><li><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/article/pii/S2666998624001728""><strong>Tactile Interfaces</strong></a> → Touchscreens, trackpads, haptic vibrations, and adaptive textures that make interaction physical. The iPhone’s multitouch screen (2007) made touch the dominant input for a generation.</li><li><a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.cose.2023.103448""><strong>Voice Interfaces</strong></a> → Spoken interaction with assistants like Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant. Generative AI extends this to conversational agents voice mode, emphasizing tone, intent, and context over fixed commands.</li><li><a href=""https://www.hci.org.uk/article/exploring-the-role-of-gestural-interaction-in-user-interface-design-challenges-and-opportunities/""><strong>Gesture Interfaces</strong></a> → Motion-based control through cameras and sensors, from the Nintendo Wii (2006) and Microsoft Kinect (2010) to AR/VR hand tracking. They extend interface design into physical space and embodiment.</li><li><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6914248/""><strong>Neural Interfaces</strong></a> → Brain–computer links such as Neuralink or medical prosthetics that translate thought into action. These collapse the boundary between user and system, making ethics inseparable from cognition itself.</li><li><a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/3/600""><strong>Mixed Reality Interfaces</strong></a> → Hybrid environments such as virtual and augmented reality that merge visual, tactile, and spatial interaction. Examples include Meta Quest, Apple Vision Pro, and AI-powered immersive design spaces.</li></ul><p>Every modality encodes a worldview — about who controls interaction, what is considered intuitive, and where agency resides. <em>Ethical Interface Design</em> asks not only how interfaces function, but what kind of human they imagine.</p><h3>Ethical Foundations</h3><p>Ethics has always asked how we ought to act. From <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-ethics/"">Aristotle’s pursuit of virtue</a> to <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/"">Kant’s universal duty</a> and <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism-history/"">Mill’s utilitarian calculus</a>, moral philosophy has sought to balance intention, outcome, and character. In design, these same questions take form in pixels, code, and policies. Every layout, algorithm, and feedback loop implies an answer to an ethical question — sometimes implicitly, sometimes with intent.</p><p>Yet the foundations of ethics are not absolute. Thinkers like <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/"">Nietzsche</a>, <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/foucault/"">Foucault</a>, and <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/derrida/"">Derrida</a> challenged the idea of universal morality, arguing that ethical systems are shaped by culture, power, and interpretation. From this view, ethics is not a fixed code but a living discourse — one that evolves with our technologies and values. What counts as “good design” may therefore reflect not timeless truth, but the shifting moral architectures of an age.</p><h4>Philosophical Frameworks</h4><p><em>Ethical Interface Design</em> draws from a range of philosophical frameworks that form the foundation of <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html""><em>The Five Pillars of Ethical Interface Design</em></a>. While ethics is contextual, these pillars rest on moral principles widely recognized across contemporary society.</p><p>These principles act as guiding coordinates rather than fixed rules, reflecting a shared yet evolving moral landscape. The <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html"">Five Pillars</a> reveal how ethical tensions emerge when values intersect — the goal is not to eliminate these contradictions but to make them visible, allowing designers to act with clarity and intent.</p><p>History shows how one value can override another — privacy may yield to collective well-being during crises, or inclusion may challenge merit-based systems. <em>Ethical Interface Design</em> highlights these trade-offs, guiding designers toward more transparent and deliberate choices.</p><h4>Core Ethical and Philosophical Principles</h4><p>The following list outlines major philosophical frameworks relevant to ethical design. While many other schools of thought exist, these principles form the foundational basis for <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html""><em>The Five Pillars of Ethical Interface Design</em></a>.</p><ul><li><a href=""https://www.britannica.com/topic/collectivism""><strong>Collectivism</strong></a> → A moral and political philosophy that prioritizes the needs, goals, and well-being of the group over individual interests. It emphasizes cooperation, shared responsibility, and social interdependence as essential to human flourishing.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/communitarianism/""><strong>Communitarianism</strong></a> → A perspective emphasizing community, shared values, and social responsibility in shaping moral and political life. It critiques excessive individualism in liberal thought.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/""><strong>Egalitarianism</strong></a> → The view that all individuals deserve equal moral consideration and that social and economic inequalities require justification. It emphasizes fairness, equal opportunity, and the reduction of arbitrary privilege.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/""><strong>Kantian Ethics</strong></a> → A deontological moral theory grounded in reason and autonomy. It holds that moral action arises from adherence to universal moral laws derived from rational duty.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/""><strong>Liberalism</strong></a> → A political and moral philosophy that upholds individual rights, freedom of choice, and consent as the basis of legitimacy. It limits interference by the state or others in personal domains.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/""><strong>Libertarianism</strong></a> → A philosophy centered on individual liberty and minimal external control. It values personal autonomy, voluntary exchange, and limited government intervention, often resisting collective mandates or welfare-oriented design.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/meritocracy/""><strong>Meritocracy</strong></a> → The belief that rewards and positions should reflect individual talent, effort, and achievement rather than social status or inherited privilege. It values ability and contribution as the basis for distribution.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatism/""><strong>Pragmatism</strong></a> → A philosophical movement that evaluates ideas and actions by their practical effects. It privileges usefulness and results over strict adherence to principles or absolute truth.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism/""><strong>Utilitarianism</strong></a> → A consequentialist theory asserting that moral value depends on outcomes, with the best action being the one that maximizes overall happiness or minimizes suffering for the greatest number.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/""><strong>Virtue Ethics</strong></a> → A moral framework emphasizing the cultivation of moral character and the pursuit of virtue. It focuses on traits such as honesty, integrity, and wisdom as the foundation of ethical behavior.</li></ul><h4>Toward an Ethical Interface</h4><p>As we move into an era defined by artificial intelligence, automation, and neural integration, ethics becomes both more complex and more urgent. Interfaces now operate at cognitive and emotional levels once considered private. The goal of <em>Ethical Interface Design</em> is to preserve human dignity within this expanding field of influence.</p><h3>The Five Pillars of <em>Ethical Interface Design</em></h3><p><a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html""><em>The Five Pillars of Ethical Interface Design</em></a> are built on established <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/ethics.html"">ethical principles</a> and common and emerging <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/modalities.html"">interface modalities</a>. Together, they reveal how moral values manifest across different modes of interaction — and how every ethical choice involves trade-offs that designers must navigate responsibly.</p><p>To learn more, review the principles in detail below. For a concise overview, refer to the <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/img/five-pillars-ethical-design-2025.pdf"">summary table</a>.</p><h4>Inclusion</h4><p>Inclusion ensures that interfaces welcome, represent, and empower people across abilities, cultures, and contexts. It rejects design that privileges one type of user at the expense of others and treats accessibility not as accommodation but as design integrity. An inclusive interface assumes difference as a constant, not an exception.</p><p><strong>Examples Across Modalities</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Visual Interfaces</strong> → Support diverse visual and linguistic literacies through adjustable type scales, high-contrast modes, and culturally inclusive iconography.</li><li><strong>Tactile Interfaces</strong> → Design haptic feedback and physical controls that accommodate varied dexterity and sensory abilities, ensuring equitable interaction.</li><li><strong>Voice Interfaces</strong> → Train recognition systems on global accents, dialects, and speech patterns to prevent bias toward dominant languages.</li><li><strong>Gesture Interfaces</strong> → Calibrate motion detection for diverse ranges of movement, body types, and physical capabilities instead of a single “ideal” gesture model.</li><li><strong>Neural Interfaces</strong> → Build adaptive systems that account for neurodiversity, cognitive variation, and comfort levels in signal interpretation.</li><li><strong>Mixed Reality Interfaces</strong> → Configure AR and VR environments to support varied sensory sensitivities, spatial perception, and physical comfort across users.</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Underlying Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Rooted in <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/"">Egalitarianism</a>. The core claim is moral equality — like cases should be treated alike unless a relevant difference justifies unequal treatment. In design terms, capability differences, cultural background, and context are relevant inputs to equalize effective opportunity, not reasons to exclude.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Contrasting Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/meritocracy/"">Meritocracy</a> links reward to demonstrated talent, effort, or productivity, appealing to fairness through performance. In design, this logic supports optimizing for “power users” or “high-value segments” to maximize efficiency and impact.</blockquote><p><strong>Ethical Tension: Equality vs. Merit</strong></p><p><strong>Design Focus</strong> → Design for accessibility and difference as defaults while recognizing merit, balancing equality with performance.</p><ul><li>Adopt accessibility guidelines (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/"">WCAG</a>, <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/"">WAI-ARIA</a>) as creative constraints.</li><li>Use participatory methods to include marginalized users in testing and feedback.</li><li>Offer personalization — contrast, input method, motion sensitivity, voice settings — without stigma.</li><li>Audit datasets, prompts, and imagery for cultural or algorithmic bias.</li><li>Frame inclusivity as an innovation driver that benefits all users.</li><li>Provide “power features” as additive layers, not the default path.</li><li>Evaluate efficiency metrics for the whole user base, not just the fastest quartile.</li></ul><h4>Autonomy</h4><p>Autonomy protects the user’s capacity to think, choose, and act without manipulation or coercion. In interface design, it means preserving agency — giving users real control over what they see, share, and decide.</p><p><strong>Examples Across Modalities</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Visual Interfaces</strong> → Empower users to manage visibility and consent through clear privacy controls, opt-in dialogs, and transparent data-use indicators.</li><li><strong>Tactile Interfaces</strong> → Provide physical controls, such as undo buttons and emergency stops, that let users reverse or interrupt actions on their own terms.</li><li><strong>Voice Interfaces</strong> → Require explicit verbal control over actions, ensuring conscious intent over automated interpretation.</li><li><strong>Gesture Interfaces</strong> → Design gestures that distinguish deliberate intent from incidental movement, preventing unintended triggers.</li><li><strong>Neural Interfaces</strong> → Secure informed consent and allow opt-out before interpreting or predicting user intent from neural signals.</li><li><strong>Mixed Reality Interfaces</strong> → Give users control over spatial permissions, tracking boundaries, and data sharing within AR and VR environments.</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Underlying Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Grounded in <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/"">Kantian Ethics</a>. People must be treated as ends in themselves, not as means to collective goals. Ethical action respects rational self-rule, even when doing so conflicts with collective well-being. Favor transparent choices, meaningful consent, and reversibility over efficiency or mass benefit.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Contrasting Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism/"">Utilitarianism</a> values the greatest good for the greatest number. This approach may favor streamlined decisions, the removal of risky options, or persuasive defaults to maximize collective well-being and system efficiency.</blockquote><p><strong>Ethical Tension: Freedom vs. Welfare</strong></p><p><strong>Design Focus</strong> → Preserve informed choice while allowing limited, transparent guidance that prevents harm without coercion.</p><ul><li>Treat informed consent as ongoing and contextual.</li><li>Provide granular settings for automation and data sharing.</li><li>Default to privacy-preserving choices.</li><li>State clearly where automation begins and ends.</li><li>Eliminate dark patterns and manipulative urgency cues.</li><li>When nudging for welfare, disclose the nudge, show the rationale, and offer a one-tap opt-out.</li><li>Provide escape hatches (undo, exit, manual override).</li></ul><h4>Transparency</h4><p>Transparency concerns the integrity of information shared between humans and systems. It requires honesty, disclosure, and authenticity so that what is shown aligns with what is real. It provides the truthful foundation necessary for understanding, accountability, and rational choice.</p><p><strong>Examples Across Modalities</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Visual Interfaces</strong> → Present data truthfully through accurate charts, clear sponsorship labels, and visible indicators of AI-generated or manipulated media.</li><li><strong>Tactile Interfaces</strong> → Provide feedback that reflects the true system state, distinguishing between successful actions, errors, and pending responses.</li><li><strong>Voice Interfaces</strong> → Disclose when users are interacting with non-human agents and summarize what information is recorded or retained.</li><li><strong>Gesture Interfaces</strong> → Notify users when motion data is being tracked, interpreted, or stored to maintain awareness of system observation.</li><li><strong>Neural Interfaces</strong> → Distinguish which neural signals can be measured versus which should be, clarifying how thought-related data is interpreted and used.</li><li><strong>Mixed Reality Interfaces</strong> → Display clear boundaries between simulated and real elements, including visibility into what is recorded, shared, or AI-generated within AR/VR environments.</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Underlying Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Draws on <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/"">Virtue Ethics</a>. Honesty and truthfulness appear as reliable presentation, avoidance of deception, and willingness to disclose limits. Interfaces operationalize these traits via faithful visualizations, provenance signals, and candid explanation of uncertainty.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Contrasting Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatism/"">Pragmatism</a> values what works over what is strictly true. It treats clarity and usefulness as higher goods than full disclosure, accepting that some truths may be simplified or deferred when they hinder progress.</blockquote><p><strong>Ethical Tension: Truth vs. Utility</strong></p><p><strong>Design Focus</strong> → Reveal truth and uncertainty clearly and in context, maintaining usability and trust.</p><ul><li>Disclose algorithmic involvement in rankings and outputs.</li><li>Make consent and data flows comprehensible in context.</li><li>Expose uncertainty and known limitations.</li><li>Align copy and feedback with actual system behavior.</li><li>Design clarity as a user benefit, not just compliance.</li><li>Use layered explanations: short, then expandable detail — never hide conflicts of interest.</li><li>Avoid “spin” — simplify presentation without sacrificing truth.</li></ul><h4>Privacy</h4><p>Privacy safeguards the boundary between the individual and the system. It upholds user control over information, attention, and identity — defining the conditions under which data is observed, shared, or stored.</p><p><strong>Examples Across Modalities</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Visual Interfaces</strong> → Provide clear permission settings, visible tracking indicators, and accessible private modes that let users manage visibility and data exposure.</li><li><strong>Tactile Interfaces</strong> → Incorporate hardware shutters, physical switches, and tactile indicators to give users direct control over sensors and device activity.</li><li><strong>Voice Interfaces</strong> → Include audible or visual cues when recording begins, and enable quick, in-flow deletion or redaction of captured speech.</li><li><strong>Gesture Interfaces</strong> → Capture movement data only upon explicit initiation, ensuring gestures are recorded intentionally rather than passively monitored.</li><li><strong>Neural Interfaces</strong> → Protect sensitive neural data through local processing, encryption, and consent-based access to signal interpretation.</li><li><strong>Mixed Reality Interfaces</strong> → Allow users to define spatial privacy zones and control when spatial mapping, camera feeds, or biometric data are shared.</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Underlying Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Informed by <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/"">Liberalism</a>. Individuals possess rights to personal domain and consent that constrain collective or commercial interests. Privacy functions as a precondition of autonomy by preserving mental space for deliberation, identity formation, and dissent.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Contrasting Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/communitarianism/"">Communitarianism</a> prioritizes common goods and may endorse broader sharing for safety, coordination, or solidarity. Legitimate community aims must be balanced against the standing claim of individuals to control access and use of their data.</blockquote><p><strong>Ethical Tension: Autonomy vs. Solidarity</strong></p><p><strong>Design Focus</strong> → Protect dignity through consent and control while permitting ethical data sharing for genuine collective benefit.</p><ul><li>Practice data minimization.</li><li>Show what’s shared, why, and for how long — without fatigue.</li><li>Make controls accessible, contextual, and reversible.</li><li>Process data on the user’s device whenever possible — use cloud storage or computation only when essential and clearly justified.</li><li>Frame privacy as trust that enables participation.</li><li>For “common good” uses, require aggregation, anonymization, purpose binding, and expiry by default.</li><li>Provide opt-out mechanisms for any data pooling or sharing when feasible — document non-optional cases.</li></ul><h4>Well-Being</h4><p>Well-being asks whether technology supports human and ecological flourishing — psychological, social, physical, and environmental. It favors sustained clarity, balance, and restoration over compulsive engagement, overuse, or unsustainable resource demand.</p><p><strong>Examples Across Modalities</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Visual Interfaces</strong> → Design calm visual hierarchies, offer dark or focus modes, and adjust color temperature or brightness over time to reduce eye strain and fatigue.</li><li><strong>Tactile Interfaces</strong> → Use haptic cues to encourage rest, posture shifts, or mindful breaks, supporting physical comfort and recovery.</li><li><strong>Voice Interfaces</strong> → Employ tone and pacing that convey calm support without emotional manipulation or artificial empathy.</li><li><strong>Gesture Interfaces</strong> → Encourage healthy movement through interaction patterns that counter sedentary use and promote active engagement.</li><li><strong>Neural Interfaces</strong> → Adapt cognitive pacing and information density to match user comprehension and prevent overload or fatigue.</li><li><strong>Mixed Reality Interfaces</strong> → Balance immersion with grounding cues, allowing users to pause, recalibrate, or exit experiences to protect mental and physical well-being.</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Underlying Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Anchored in <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/topic/collectivism"">Collectivism</a><strong>.</strong> Well-being is measured by the health of the collective — how design supports shared welfare, mutual dependence, and the long-term sustainability of both human and ecological systems. Design choices emphasize cooperation, community benefit, and responsibility for collective outcomes over purely individual gain.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Contrasting Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/"">Libertarianism</a> prioritizes individual freedom and self-determination, often resisting design constraints that guide or limit user behavior for the sake of collective good. From this view, interventions that promote well-being — such as limiting usage or prompting rest — can be seen as paternalistic, infringing on personal autonomy even when intended for protection or benefit.</blockquote><p><strong>Ethical Tension: Welfare vs. Freedom</strong></p><p><strong>Design Focus</strong> → Foster flourishing and reduce harm without violating autonomy or moral boundaries.</p><ul><li>Replace engagement KPIs with well-being metrics: satisfaction, balance, trust, recovery.</li><li>Use persuasion for healthy habits, not compulsion.</li><li>Add protective friction: time limits, focus modes, optional pauses.</li><li>Assess long-term emotional and cognitive effects of tone, color, and loops.</li><li>Test for calm, clarity, and self-perception, not only task completion.</li><li>Offer well-being prompts as configurable aids with clear off switches.</li><li>Decouple core utility from compulsive loops (infinite scroll, variable rewards).</li></ul><h3>Design for the Future</h3><p>Design for the future means translating moral philosophy into tangible choices that shape how people live, work, and connect. <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/index.html""><em>Ethical Interface Design</em></a> and the <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html"">Five Pillars</a> framework were developed by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/micbuckcreative/"">Michael Buckley</a> to help designers approach emerging technologies with awareness and accountability.

<h4><strong>AI can automate frameworks, but not their interpretation or meaning.</strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Minimal composition of neutral-coloured material samples arranged in geometric blocks on a soft beige background, suggesting structure, relationships and design frameworks."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*b8DzJdpcGkM2SfZcyrbI2Q.jpeg"" /></figure><p>AI can now generate design artefacts in seconds. It can fill in a Value Proposition Canvas, a journey map, or a jobs-to-be-done structure with impressive speed and coherence. For designers and other professionals, this raises an uncomfortable question: if machines can apply the tools of our disciplines, where does that leave human expertise?</p><p>The answer lies not in what AI can produce, but in what humans can <em>decide</em>. The real transformation is not about replacing expertise, but about separating the visible outputs of design and strategy from the judgement that gives those outputs meaning. The part of professional work being automated is not the expertise itself. It is the formatting. The model doesn’t replace human judgement; it replicates its surface patterns.</p><p>This distinction matters because in many disciplines, frameworks frameworksincluding design systems, journey maps and strategy canvases — have gradually become confused with expertise. In reality, frameworks were never the work. They were simply a way to show the thinking behind the work.</p><blockquote>A canvas, a storyboard, a strategic quadrant or a journey map is a visible output of reasoning. It is not the reasoning itself.</blockquote><p>Designers and professionals are trusted not because they can draw boxes in the correct configuration, but because they can decide what those boxes should mean in this particular context, and why certain trade-offs deserve priority.</p><p>This becomes especially clear in a phrase that appears frequently in AI technical discussions: “once you have a knowledge graph.” It sounds like a neutral implementation detail, but it conceals something fundamental. A knowledge-graph structure implies that the relevant concepts have already been chosen, that the relationships between them have already been defined, and that the worldview has already been interpreted. The graph does not emerge automatically from data. It is the result of decisions about relevance and meaning. In other words, the interpretive step — the step that decides what something really means — is already done by humans before the model can do anything intelligent with the structure.</p><p>Once meaning is structured, AI can format it into any template shape you like: a canvas, a SWOT, a JTBD card, a “north star” narrative or a product-positioning document. These are all just containers for meaning. The automation is real. And designers and professionals who ignore these new capabilities will eventually feel pressure from those who adopt them. But the layer that becomes automated is not the layer where value originates. It is the layer where value becomes visible.</p><p>This leads to a larger shift taking place across design and the professions more broadly. The next decade is unlikely to be defined by whether AI can perform technical tasks. It is already clear that it can. The future of work will be shaped by where professional value migrates in response. Designers and professionals who have defined themselves primarily by their ability to apply tools will see their contribution begin to shrink, not because they are being replaced by machines, but because the level of work they have specialised in is now becoming commoditised.</p><p>Where value increases is in the upstream layer: the ability to define the context, shape the problem, discern what matters and design the meaning architecture within which decisions will operate. In product development, for instance, the meaning architecture is not the journey map or the sprint cadence itself, but the decision to prioritise long-term ethical design over short-term growth, or to define ‘customer value’ in a way that includes accessibility and inclusion. These are structural choices about what the organisation believes to be valuable, and they shape every subsequent framework or metric that follows.</p><p>These are not technical choices; they are leadership ones. And because AI accelerates the downstream tasks so dramatically, the upstream space becomes more valuable. The gravitational pull of automation is downward toward execution. The centre of human advantage moves upward toward sensemaking.</p><p>In reality, the relationship between AI and human professionals is less a division of labour than a feedback loop. Automated outputs can expose hidden assumptions or new correlations, prompting humans to revisit and refine the structures of meaning themselves. The speed of automation accelerates the human capacity for interpretation by providing more “first drafts” to react to, question and evolve. In this sense, AI doesn’t just apply frameworks faster — it multiplies the opportunities for deeper sensemaking.</p><p>This is why, in strategic practice, the deepest leverage is not in the artefacts themselves but in the operating logic behind them. For example, in customer-centric strategy work, it is not the journey map or the value-proposition template that drives transformation, but the underlying ontology of the business. Frameworks such as the Customer Centricity Strategy Framework, used in strategic design practice, operate at this level, defining how customer value is understood, related and governed. This is the layer where meaning lives.</p><p>Deciding what matters is not only a rational act but also a deeply human one. It involves reading the emotional climate of an organisation, understanding unspoken cultural dynamics, and sensing how ideas will land with people. Frameworks may help clarify choices, but it is empathy, discretion and moral awareness that allow those choices to take root. The human advantage lies not only in deciding what matters, but in helping others believe in and act on it.</p><figure><img alt=""A person’s hand arranges natural and crafted materials — wood, ceramic, shells, and small objects — on a marble surface beside a cup of tea, suggesting human curation, reflection, and creativity."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*S48RRgrQ5v4gyW_93HEkZQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Human sensemaking in action — arranging, selecting and interpreting elements to create coherence and meaning.</figcaption></figure><p>So the real future-of-work question is not “Will AI replace me?” The more accurate question is: “At what level am I operating?” If your identity is tied to applying templates, AI will apply them faster. If your identity is tied to interpreting reality, your value not only remains, it increases. Designers and professionals do not become obsolete because their tools become automated. They become obsolete when they equate their professional identity with the tools.</p><p>AI can apply any framework. But only humans can decide what matters. The future of work will not be defined by competition between human and machine capability, but by the reallocation of value — from tool application to meaning architecture — and that is where real transformation in organisations is most likely to happen next.</p><p><em>For further reading on the deeper architecture of customer-centric meaning, see</em> <a href=""https://a.co/d/5vceae5""><strong><em>Designing Customer Experiences with Soul: How to Build Products, Services and Brands that People Genuinely Love</em></strong></a>, <em>which explores the ontology behind customer value and strategic coherence.</em></p><h4><strong>Author</strong></h4><p>Simon Robinson is CEO (Worldwide) of Holonomics and a global thought leader on customer experience, systems thinking and strategic transformation.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=cb6e2dfecf6d"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-new-professional-core-the-future-of-work-is-sensemaking-cb6e2dfecf6d"">The future of work is sensemaking</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>When you can build a working prototype in an afternoon, the question is no longer <em>can you make it</em> — it’s <em>should you build it</em>, and <em>what should you build</em>.</h4><figure><img alt=""Central target with four coral hands reaching toward it, connected by teal circuit board lines and technology icons"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ja7QeYOYZ4XrSSk5eA3opw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Most founders and teams struggle with those questions, not because they lack conviction, but because they test that conviction too late. Resources get committed before customer needs are validated. Confirmation bias filters what gets heard. They often fall in love with solutions before fully understanding the problems they need to solve.</p><p>AI-accelerated development affects everyone — from solo founders building alone to small startup teams to larger software organizations at scaleups and enterprises. Whether you’re a team of one or one hundred, the challenge is the same: deciding what deserves to exist.</p><p>The CHAOS Report (Standish Group, 2020) indicates that more than two-thirds of software projects fail to meet their intended outcomes. While execution failures play a role, the problems often begin earlier — in the discovery phase. A focus on delivery velocity has replaced the judgment time needed to uncover what truly matters.</p><h3>Co-Invention: Redesigning Discovery</h3><p>I had spent six weeks conducting discovery and design on an AI-powered toolkit to accelerate product discovery when I came across Ajay Agrawal’s YouTube interview, &quot;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhfpHwcrx6c"">The AI Economist: The Skill You Need to Stay Employed in the Age of AI</a>&quot; (Full interview is 1 hour and 5 minutes). I was researching AI capabilities for the toolkit when his insight stopped me in my tracks. In my experience, software teams often skipped proper discovery, claiming they didn’t have time. I saw AI as the solution to a productivity problem: automate tasks, integrate workflows, and make discovery faster so software teams would have fewer excuses not to do it properly.</p><p>In their book <em>Power and Prediction</em>, Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb (2022) describe what happened when factories first adopted electricity. Manufacturers replaced steam engines with electric motors, but retained the same layout — one large motor, complex belts and pulleys, and machines clustered around a central power source. Productivity barely improved. The breakthrough came when they redesigned around electricity’s potential: machines could go anywhere, organized by workflow rather than power source.</p><p>This is what they call co-invention: the new technology is only part of the solution. The real value lies in inventing complementary systems, processes, and organizational structures that leverage the technology's strengths.</p><p>Today we’re making the same mistake with AI — bolting it onto existing workflows, increasing speed without improving outcomes. An effective AI-human partnership requires co-inventing new systems that leverage the strengths of each. The processes that guide discovery need fundamental redesign, not around speed, but around judgment.</p><p>Speed without judgment means building the wrong things faster.</p><h3>Prediction vs Judgment</h3><p>Agrawal’s deeper insight reframed my thinking. In the human-AI partnership, AI makes predictions radically faster — filling in missing information, recognizing patterns, generating options, and forecasting outcomes. What remains scarce is judgment: the ability to interpret meaning, weigh trade-offs, and decide what’s worth pursuing.</p><p><a href=""https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxkhxVv155CAE29w9F2Dal4uOtXrRKFuEZ?si=iZTAjfaqrrJrD4o2""><strong><em>Watch economist Ajay Agrawal explain this distinction</em></strong><em>(1 minute)</em></a></p><p>Decision-making is the interplay of prediction and judgment. AI handles what is likely to happen. Humans decide what should be done about it.</p><blockquote><strong>“AI handles what is likely to happen. Humans decide what should be done about it.”</strong></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Diagram showing AI prediction capabilities (pattern recognition, synthesis, generating options) on the left converging with human judgment capabilities (determining purpose, interpreting meaning, weighing tradeoffs) on the right into decision-making at the center"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/784/1*_uav4SS4tk8EzfaiTJkeQQ.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>In discovery, this plays out constantly. AI can analyze customer-interview transcripts and identify patterns across dozens of conversations — that’s prediction. But we must decide whether those patterns represent real problems worth solving or simply interesting noise — that’s judgment.</p><p>AI can forecast which features might increase engagement — that’s prediction. Only humans can decide how well they align with customers’ needs and the product’s vision, purpose and principles — that’s judgment.</p><p>Brandon Harwood (2025) describes this distinction in his framework for AI-powered product design, noting that specific tasks must remain human-centric due to the need for judgment, intuition, and emotional intelligence. What AI accelerates is synthesis; what humans provide is meaning-making.</p><p>Judgment develops by making decisions under uncertainty and owning the consequences. When you pursue an opportunity based on limited evidence, ship it, and learn it was the wrong bet, that failure can grow your judgment. When you kill a beloved idea because evidence doesn’t support it and that decision proves correct, that success strengthens your judgment. Learning comes from the whole cycle: decide → act → observe → reflect.</p><p>Discovery judgment is the practice of developing judgment about what deserves to exist. It’s not a single activity but a set of practices: identifying opportunities, talking to customers about their needs, mapping assumptions about what would make a solution valuable, testing those assumptions with minimal investment, and deciding when evidence is strong enough to commit resources.</p><p>Sinek’s (2009) Golden Circle, explored in <em>Start with Why</em> and his TED Talk <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action"">“How Great Leaders Inspire Action”</a>, provides a valuable lens for understanding why judgment remains a human trait. The Golden Circle shows that inspiring action starts with <em>why</em> — purpose and belief — then moves to <em>how</em>, and finally <em>what</em> you produce. This order is often reversed, starting with what or how to build.</p><p>AI can handle the how and even suggest the what. Only humans can determine the why, which makes it worthwhile to build. Judgment is the capacity to reason about purpose, meaning, and value — capabilities that belong uniquely to us.</p><h3>Cross-Functional Discovery Judgment</h3><p>If discovery judgment is scarce, everyone involved in bringing software to market needs to develop it. Discovery emerges from judgment calls across multiple perspectives — technical feasibility, user needs, market fit, operational constraints, and strategy.</p><p>Solo founders and small teams make all these judgment calls themselves, constantly switching between perspectives. You’re the product person AND the engineer AND the designer — often feeling overwhelmed by the need to think across domains that don’t come naturally.</p><p>Larger teams distribute these perspectives across various roles, including product managers, engineers, designers, user researchers, and customer success. When these perspectives stay siloed, teams consistently build the wrong things. The “that’s not my job” mindset creates blind spots that AI acceleration only amplifies.</p><p>Tutti Taygerly (2020) learned this at Facebook: true collaboration isn’t about stakeholders handing work to each other — it’s about establishing trust and reasoning together from the start. Whether developing multi-perspective judgment as a solo founder or learning to reason together as a team, the principle is the same: cross-functional discovery judgment determines whether you build the right things.</p><p>For solo builders, this means developing judgment across domains you might not naturally think in — and creating systematic practices to compensate for working alone. For teams, it means different perspectives combining to form a better collective judgment. Over time, this capability compounds — solo founders develop intuition across multiple domains, and teams learn to reason together effectively.</p><p>For organizations, siloed discovery wastes insight and resources. For individuals working alone, a lack of systematic practices wastes time and money. For professionals staying narrow in their function, they become replaceable.</p><h3>Discovery as a Continuous Loop</h3><p>Discovery isn’t a pre-build phase — it’s a continuous practice that runs alongside delivery in an ongoing learning loop. Whether working solo or in teams, you discover what to build, deliver it, learn from what happens, and feed those insights back into the next round of discovery.</p><blockquote><strong>“Discovery isn’t a pre-build phase — it’s a continuous practice running alongside delivery in an ongoing learning loop.”</strong></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Circular diagram illustrating the continuous discovery-delivery-learning cycle with arrows showing how builders discover what to build, deliver it, learn from outcomes, and feed insights back into the next discovery cycle"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mgTX7TtZVj4kuIf97UINzQ.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>Discovery requires double-loop learning: not only asking Did this feature succeed? but examining the assumptions and reasoning behind it. Single-loop learning adjusts what you do; double-loop learning improves how you think about what to do.</p><p>Matthew Godfrey (2020) explores this in his work on the critical role of discovery, noting that the best product teams recognize that discovery and delivery should run concurrently and continuously, rather than as separate, sequential phases. This dual-track approach enables teams to address problems as they arise throughout the product development process.</p><p>As builders move through the discovery–delivery–learning loop, they’re not just refining the product — they’re refining their judgment. Each cycle sharpens your sense of what matters, which assumptions to test first, and what evidence is sufficient to act on. For teams, when this capability becomes shared, organizations learn to reason together — and that capacity compounds. For solo founders, systematic practice creates the judgment that teams might develop through diverse perspectives.</p><p>Solo founders often think they can skip systematic practices because “I am the product person AND the engineer AND the designer.” But that’s why the loop matters more — you need systematic practices to compensate for not having diverse perspectives catching your blind spots in real-time.</p><h3>Why This Matters Now</h3><p>When spreadsheets arrived, accounting firms hired fewer accountants — but those who remained became more strategic and better compensated. Arithmetic specialists moved on; judgment-oriented accountants thrived.</p><p>Software builders face the same shift. The ratio of value to people is changing dramatically. Your value isn’t in what AI can generate — code, mock-ups, or transcripts. It’s in developing discovery judgment: framing the right problems, interpreting evidence, weighing trade-offs, and helping others do the same.</p><p>I’ve seen this pattern repeatedly throughout my career. Teams would spend months building technically impressive solutions — only to discover they’d solved problems no customer actually had. The breakthrough came when we started mapping assumptions systematically before building—the same talented people, but different discovery judgment practices.</p><p>The market is splitting: professionals who use AI merely to execute faster versus those who use AI to amplify their judgment. The latter will become increasingly valuable precisely because AI can’t automate judgment. As Teixeira and Braga (2025) document in <em>The State of UX in 2025</em>, algorithms and automated tools are taking over execution tasks, making human judgment about purpose and meaning increasingly valuable.</p><p>For solo founders and small teams, this shift is even more pronounced. You can now build a complete product yourself using AI — but your judgment quality determines whether that product solves a real problem. The democratization of building capability means your competitive advantage is 100% in judgment, not execution speed.</p><p>If this all feels like too much change, that’s natural. AI is rewriting how we work; uncertainty is real; change feels relentless. But you’re already making judgment calls every day — deciding priorities, interpreting feedback, choosing when to proceed or pause. It isn’t new work; it’s becoming deliberate about the work that matters most.</p><blockquote><strong>“Speed and judgment used to be a trade-off. Now they’re both required — and only one can be automated.”</strong></blockquote><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>When AI makes building and delivering software easier, faster and more cost-effective, judgment becomes the scarce resource.</li><li>Judgment develops through decisions under uncertainty and reflection on results.</li><li>Cross-functional discovery judgment is the ability to interpret evidence and decide what deserves to be built and why — whether you’re building solo or as a team.</li><li>Discovery judgment is a continuous, double-loop learning practice, not a phase.</li><li>The software market is segmenting: those who focus on delivering faster versus those who compete on wisdom and strategic value.</li></ul><h3>References</h3><p>Agrawal, A., Gans, J., &amp; Goldfarb, A.

<p>Cosmic beings, welcome to the grand finale of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio season</a>… and it’s not going out quietly. This week, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrogrades back into Scorpio</a> on the 18th, joining Venus and the Sun in this emotionally raw, fiercely transformative water sign. With so many planets swimming through the shadows, don’t be surprised if your inner world feels louder than usual. Conversations may rewind to long-forgotten truths, secrets might slip, and connections — especially romantic or financial — could deepen or dissolve. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-scorpio-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Venus in Scorpio</a> craves intimacy with a capital “I,” and Mercury’s return here suggests the Universe is giving us one last chance to revisit what was left unsaid. <br /><br />Meanwhile, from November 17 to 19, the Moon disappears from the sky. This is the dark moon phase: the quiet, liminal space before a new beginning. It’s a cosmic cocoon that invites stillness, surrender, and deep emotional excavation. Old insecurities, shadow selves, and fears may surface during this time, not to punish you, but to be witnessed, embraced, and alchemized. If you find yourself overthinking, oversleeping, or even crying unexpectedly this week, you’re not broken… you’re unraveling. This is the fertile soil where your next version takes root. </p>



<p>The Scorpio New Moon arrives on November 20, offering us a powerful collective reset. This lunation is your chance to transmute pain into power. Scorpio teaches us that endings make space for beginnings, and this new moon is a portal to rise from the ashes. Set intentions around healing, emotional truth, sensual liberation, and regenerative growth. Whether you’re letting go of a past version of yourself or calling in a new one, this new moon whispers: <em>you are the storm, and you are the calm after it</em>. Prepare to emerge cleansed, reawakened, and ready for Sagittarius season’s fire. <br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831490.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>You’re no stranger to intensity, Aries, but this week’s Scorpio cauldron is bubbling <em>extra hot</em>. With the Sun, Venus, and (starting the 18th) Mercury all activating your sector of emotional bonds, vulnerability, and energetic entanglements, you may feel like you’re walking around with a lie detector strapped to your chest. Under this Scorpionic haze, secrets get whispered through dreams, eye contact, or accidental texts. Venus is dialing up your sensual magnetism, but she’s also pulling you into deeper questions: who do you trust with your body, your story, your money, your fears? Mercury retrograde here isn’t subtle either… it’s a cosmic exorcism, and you’re being asked to <em>feel</em> your way through instead of force clarity. </p>



<p>Then comes the real underworld reset: the Scorpio New Moon on November 20. This one hits different because it’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/boss-zodiac-sign-personality-meaning"">ruled by </a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/boss-zodiac-sign-personality-meaning"">your</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/boss-zodiac-sign-personality-meaning""> planetary boss Mars</a>, currently adventuring through Sagittarius and pumping you with courage, faith, and a hunger for reinvention. Between November 20 to 30, set intentions around transforming your relationship to intimacy, power, and truth. You’re not meant to stay bonded to people or patterns that drain your magic. Let yourself grieve, release, and then get free. This is your phoenix moment. Yes, it may sting. But you’ve outgrown your old ashes, babe, and Mars is guiding you to rise with humor, passion, and just the right amount of chaos. Trust that. </p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>This week’s Scorpio energy has you in a <em>deep soul gaze</em> with your connections, Taurus, and I mean <em>deep deep</em>, like “what are we really doing here?” levels. With the Sun, Venus (your cosmic ruler), and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrograde</a> all highlighting your relationship sector, things are feeling both intense and deliciously mysterious. One minute you’re like, “I could marry them,” and the next, you’re spiral-texting your bestie like, “wait… do they even like me?” This week is asking you to look beneath the surface of your partnerships, your agreements, and even your patterns. Venus wants harmony, yes, but in Scorpio? She wants <em>honesty</em>. If it’s fake peace, she’ll burn it down. </p>



<p>And then there’s that epic Scorpio New Moon on November 20, activating your rebirth in love. Whether it’s a relationship with someone else or with yourself (or honestly, both), this is your chance to wipe the emotional slate clean and choose deeper alignment. Mars in Sag is pushing you to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/living-for-the-plot-dating-adventure-travel"">stop playing it safe</a> — especially when it comes to how much you <em>really</em> share, how open you let yourself be, and how fearless you are in choosing passion over obligation. Set intentions this week that are rooted in <em>truth</em>, not fantasy. Trust that real love, whether romantic, platonic, or spiritual, can handle the heat. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>This final week of Scorpio season is turning your daily life into a bit of a pressure cooker, Gemini, but like, in a “this is forcing me to grow” kind of way. With the Sun, Venus, and retrograde Mercury (your ruler) all spotlighting your sector of routine, health, and systems, you may feel hyper-aware of what’s draining you vs. what’s sustaining you. Little things you’ve been brushing aside (like that lingering cough, that glitchy calendar, or that coworker you secretly loathe) could suddenly feel like cosmic emergencies. This isn’t a punishment… it’s your chance to clean house. Venus wants you to fall back in love with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/self-care-ideas-rituals"">your rituals</a>, while retro Mercury is like, “btw, here’s the mess under the rug.” Own it. Rework it. You’re not behind — you’re in a period of profound refinement. </p>



<p>By the time the Scorpio New Moon hits on November 20, you’re being invited to completely reimagine how you tend to your mind, body, and spirit. What does it <em>actually</em> mean to feel balanced, energized, and emotionally clean? This lunation’s giving detox, but like, the soulful kind. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Mars in Sagittarius</a> (your opposite sign) is stirring up momentum through partnerships — whether romantic or professional — so accountability is key. Set intentions to create supportive rhythms, clear communication channels, and sacred boundaries. You don’t have to do everything alone, but you do need to do what’s <em>aligned</em>. Trust your gut — it’s louder than your mind this week. </p>

<p>Cancer, the final week of Scorpio season is activating your pleasure sector with the intensity of a dramatic love letter, and yes, you’re both the writer <em>and</em> the muse. With the Sun, Venus, and now retrograde Mercury all huddled together in your realm of romance, creativity, and self-expression, it’s giving sexy rebirth. That project you abandoned? The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/situationships-dating-fulfilling-2"">situationship</a> you thought was over? The artistic impulse that felt too indulgent? All of that’s back for review, but not for chaos… for refinement. Your inner child is knocking and your inner lover is whispering. Be true to your heart’s desires. </p>



<p>The Scorpio New Moon on November 20 is a call to rise from the ashes of your old joy habits. What used to excite you but no longer fits? What desires feel dangerous but divine? With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Mars</a> (the ruler of the new moon) currently in Sagittarius, fueling your sector of wellness and devotion, the next six months are about sustaining your pleasure, not just chasing it. Set intentions that let joy be your compass <em>and</em> your strategy. You don’t need to apologize for craving beauty, sensuality, or spotlight. You just need to trust the parts of you that want to shine. </p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio season</a> is lighting a match in your roots sector and asking, “You sure you want to keep hiding that?” With the Sun, Venus, and now retrograde Mercury digging into your inner world, you may find yourself unpacking long-held secrets, family patterns, or private memories that still hold weight. This isn’t about spiraling… it’s about seeing things clearly. Venus wants softness, retro Mercury brings the receipts, and the Scorpio Sun is like, “Let’s transmute this into art, therapy, or both.” You’re being asked to feel what you’d rather skip. Let the deeper emotions come up, and let them move through you. Healing isn’t always loud — but it is potent. </p>



<p>When the Scorpio New Moon arrives on November 20, you’re being handed a blank page for rewriting your roots. What do safety and home <em>actually</em> look like to you now — not just what you were taught? The next six months are about defining that for yourself and planting seeds that honor your emotional truth. With your ruler the Sun still in Scorpio for a final week and Mars in Sag blazing through your play zone, don’t be afraid to fight for joy, even in the shadows. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-zodiac-sign-2025"">Set intentions</a> around reclaiming softness, embracing vulnerability, and building a sanctuary that reflects <em>your</em> soul. </p>

<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You’re not imagining it, Virgo: conversations feel heavier, glances more loaded, and even silence carries meaning. That’s the final week of Scorpio season activating your sector of communication and perception, and with Venus and retrograde Mercury (your ruler) joining the Sun there, you’re being called to read between the lines <em>and</em> speak from the depths. You’re rewriting mental scripts that have kept you small or overly cautious. The way you talk to yourself? Under review. The way you <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-communicate-argument-relationship"">let others speak to you</a>? Getting a major upgrade. This week isn’t about rushing to respond; it’s about finally <em>hearing</em> what your soul’s been trying to say. </p>



<p>When the Scorpio New Moon arrives on November 20, the pages of your inner journal feel charged with spells. What truths do you want to claim out loud? What ideas are begging for form? With Mars in Sag heating up your foundations sector, this isn’t about pretty words, but rather about anchoring them. You’re planting seeds in your voice, your mindset, and the way you connect to those closest to you. Speak like the future you is listening. Because they are. </p>

<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Money, worth, and what you refuse to beg for are the themes this final week of Scorpio <br /> season is dredging up, Libra. And with retrograde Mercury and your ruler Venus both in Scorpio, activating your value sector, it’s time to examine not just your finances, but the deeper beliefs <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/low-self-esteem-spending-money"">fueling your sense of “enoughness.”</a> You’re being asked to shift from “What can I get?” to “What do I <em>deserve</em>?” This isn’t a week to undersell, overgive, or people-please your way into crumbs. Your magic is currency and your time is gold, so let that reframe how you ask, spend, save, and receive. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Scorpio New Moon on November 20 invites you to reset your relationship with wealth and self-esteem alike. What new habits, rates, or rituals would help you feel more rooted in abundance? What old stories around scarcity are ready to be composted? With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Mars in Sag</a> now energizing your expression and visibility sector, the Universe wants you seen, compensated, and celebrated — but you have to claim it. Set intentions that treat your worth as non-negotiable. </p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You’ve been walking through fire with grace, Scorpio, and this week the ashes start to shimmer. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio season</a> is reaching its final chapter, and you’re no longer the version of you who whispered affirmations hoping they’d stick. You’re the one who <em>knows</em>. Who’s been watching yourself alchemize in real time. Who’s bled, cried, purged, stayed silent, screamed out loud — and still showed up. And now, the Universe wants to know: Are you ready to live like you survived it? Are you ready for your thriving era? </p>



<p>Mercury retrograding into your sign starting the 18th may stir the ghosts one last time, bringing up old lovers, doubts, “almosts” and “should haves.” But remember: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-scorpio-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Venus in Scorpio</a> is here too, wrapping you in beauty, magnetism, and truth. You don’t have to armor up to feel worthy, and you don’t have to be ultra mysterious to be respected. You are worthy <em>now</em>, in your clarity, in your softness, in your voice that’s trembling but still choosing to speak. </p>



<p>The Scorpio New Moon on November 20 is your personal renaissance. It’s a cosmic mirror asking: Who do you dare to become if you stop hiding from your own power? If you drop the need to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/11/8894550/why-dont-people-like-me"">control how others receive you</a>, and just embody your essence fully, audaciously, and unapologetically? This is Phoenix energy — pure rebirth. Shed the last of what you’ve outgrown. Grieve it, kiss it, release it, and then rise into your next timeline with a body that remembers, a spirit that’s wiser, and a gaze that sees beyond illusions. This is the week it all changes for the better, Scorpio. The week you’ve been ready for. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, this final stretch of Scorpio season feels like a spiritual prelude… like the air right before a thunderstorm, thick with omens and revelations. With Mercury and Venus both moving through your sector of healing and closure, you’re being guided to listen to what you haven’t said out loud yet: the unspoken dreams, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/biggest-fears-zodiac-sign-8th-12th-house"">fears that still whisper</a> when you’re alone, the patterns you’ve outgrown but keep rehearsing. And while you usually prefer momentum over introspection, your ruling planet <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter is retrograde in Cancer</a> right now, pulling you into the emotional depths you’ve been skimming. This is less about solving everything, and more about sitting with what’s real. Let yourself grieve a version of you that’s ready to be laid to rest, because Sag season begins this weekend, and you deserve to greet it from a lighter perspective. </p>



<p>The Scorpio New Moon on November 20 invites you to set soul-deep intentions around trust, closure, and surrender. With Jupiter retrograde harmonizing with this moon in your intuitive sector, your dreams may feel unusually prophetic — pay attention. From now through November 30, ask yourself what quiet, restorative rituals you can commit to, not to get ahead, but to <em>come home</em> to yourself. This lunation isn’t about forcing breakthroughs — it’s about creating space for them. Think journaling, prayer, unposting, or even just letting yourself nap without guilt. The rebirth this moon brings may be invisible at first, but it’s happening beneath the surface. Trust that. The next chapter begins with a whisper, not a bang… and if you listen closely, you’ll hear your future calling your name. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, Scorpio season’s final act could feel like the deep exhale you didn’t know you were holding. With the Sun, Mercury (starting the 18th), and Venus all swirling through your sector of social influence, tech, and legacy, you’re being asked to rethink how you show up in collective spaces, not just as a figure of power, but as a vulnerable human being with dreams, quirks, and stories that need to be told. <br /><br />Mercury’s retrograde in Scorpio may unearth old <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/one-on-one-friendship-benefits"">group dynamics</a>, unprocessed feelings about friendships, or questions about the future you thought you were building. Don’t run from these insights. If certain people or platforms no longer feel aligned, you’re allowed to walk away. Venus softens the burn, helping you reconnect with kindred spirits who actually <em>get you</em>, especially as you re-evaluate your digital presence. The algorithm may be mysterious, but your intuition is clearer than ever — trust it. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Scorpio New Moon on the 20th offers a chance to rebirth your relationship with community, visibility, and your greater mission. What if the people you’re meant to lead or serve can only find you when you finally let go of playing small or being too “perfect”? Set intentions this week around the impact you want to leave behind, not just the results you want to achieve. With your ruler Saturn still retrograde in Pisces for another two weeks, activating your communication sector, this is also a prime time to assess the way you speak to yourself and others. The universe is preparing to hand you a mic in December, but right now, it’s checking your soul script. Edit it with care. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, it’s giving phoenix season, and this time, you’re the one shedding layers of “<em>shoulds</em>” and “<em>not yet</em>” to embrace what your soul has <em>actually</em> been craving. With the Sun, Mercury (as of the 18th), and Venus all lighting up your career, visibility, and reputation sector, you’re entering a renewal portal that’s far less about performance and far more about <em>power</em>. Mercury retrograde in Scorpio might stir up past professional doubts, old bosses, former ambitions, or a version of you who once thought “success” looked a certain way. Let it all resurface without shame. This isn’t about rehashing old storylines… it’s about reclaiming the pen and writing your next era from a deeper, wiser place. </p>



<p>By the time the Scorpio New Moon lands on the 20th, you may feel a rush of divine clarity: <em>it’s time to stop playing it safe</em>. Let this lunation help you visualize what a bold, soul-aligned legacy could feel like — not just professionally, but energetically. What do you want to be known for? Whose lives do you want to change? With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uranus-retrograde-gemini-taurus-september-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Uranus (your modern ruler) still retrograde in Taurus</a>, activating your roots and home sector, you’re being reminded that real success starts with safety, grounding, and emotional truth. The applause may come later, but the alignment starts now. Say yes to your deeper mission. </p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>There’s something ancient waking up inside of you, Pisces… and no, it’s not just Mercury retrograde nostalgia. With Scorpio season’s final week activating your adventure, travel, publishing, and philosophy sector, and Mercury swimming backward into that same realm on the 18th, you’re being asked to revisit long-lost dreams, studies, or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/02/141240/spiritual-but-not-religious-meaning"">spiritual beliefs</a> that shaped the person you are today. Venus is there too, helping you fall back in love with the parts of your worldview you once doubted. Whether it’s a literal journey or an emotional pilgrimage, this week whispers: <em>What if your next breakthrough comes from remembering, not rushing? </em></p>



<p>The Scorpio New Moon on the 20th is your official cue to set intentions around expansion, publishing, higher learning, and sacred study. Whether you want to write your first book, travel to your ancestral lands, or simply explore a new spiritual truth, this lunation is a reminder that you don’t need to know how — it’s enough to <em>believe</em> you can. With your traditional ruler <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter retrograde in Cancer</a>, still reviewing your creativity and joy sector, you’re learning how to feel your way into abundance instead of forcing it. Stay soft, but intentional. Stay mystical, but grounded. This week is proof that your dreams are still very much alive, and they’re waiting for you to say yes. </p>

<p>The world is both a literal and metaphorical hellscape right now, and no one knows that better than <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/12/10221298/natalie-portman-sexualized-as-child-in-movies"">Natalie Portman</a>. The actress, vegan, and longtime <a href=""https://www.green4ema.org/press/natalie-portman-reveals-what-she-does-to-combat-climate-change-including-not-buying-new-clothes"">climate</a> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/02/9384364/natalie-portman-oscars-dress-cape-female-directors-names-dior"">activist</a> has been at the forefront of calls for climate change and awareness throughout her decades-long career. And now, she’s using animation to further the cause. In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNUkW6ywV-c""><em>Arco</em></a>, a newly-released animated film from French director and illustrator <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ugobienvenu/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ugo Bienvenu </a>and produced by Portman, audiences are introduced to the not-so-distant future. Except in this version of Earth, in the year 2075, those tsunamis and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wildfire-eaton-california-lost-homes"">wild fires</a> that are becoming increasingly frequent and more devastating? They’re essentially the norm; with homes outfitted with glass domes that offer protection during bouts of extreme weather. It’s here that we meet Iris, an adventurous 10-year-old looking for adventure out of her day-to-day. When, one day, she rescues Arco, a time-travelling kid transported from the future, it becomes a story on the power and impact of friendship, in more ways than one. </p>



<p>Because with him, Arco brings realities of the future. Due to the impact of climate change, Arco and his family — along with their neighbours — no longer live on Earth, moving up to tree branch-like homes in the sky that allow for the planet to repair and regenerate without human interruption. It’s a surprising, albeit not so hard to imagine reality; and one made even more impactful through Bienvenu’s use of animation, which is able to engage viewers while presenting an impactful message. </p>



<p>“Animation to me is one of the best mediums for storytelling,” Bienvenu, whose other works includes short films <em>Dolly Zero </em>and 2019’s <em>L’entretien</em>, tells Refinery29. This is for a very particular reason, specifically, the way animated films resonate with viewers, often re-watching from when they’re kids all the way up to when they become adults, and choose to share their favourite movies, be it <em>Aladdin</em>, <em>The Fox and the Hound</em> or <em>Coco</em>, with their own children. “[You watch] animation movies all over your life, they accompany you all your life. And making a movie is long, so I wanted to do something that could have a [long] impact on the people that would watch it.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11943042.jpeg?width=1024&amp;height=577&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A577"" /></figure>



<p>And in many instances, it’s kids who are going to change the world — often in inventive ways. This is a truth made clear as Iris tries to help Arco get home, all while navigating changing environmental elements (Arco needs very specific weather — sunny with rain — to time travel) and a society that’s essentially run by drones. On the surface, it may seem like an engaging and earnest story about the bonds of friendship – and it is — but there’s something deeper to it, too. </p>



<p>As Iris and Arco try tirelessly to set up the perfect environmental conditions for him to return home, covering Iris’s front lawn in pillows and couch cushions for Arco to jump into and setting the sprinkler to go off at the exact right moment, there’s an underlying frustration with their inability to do so, and with the knowledge that those conditions, now in this current climate, are unlikely to come naturally. Arco’s stranded; a feeling probably akin to what many young people feel today when it comes to thinking about our planet. </p>



<p>But Arco and Iris don’t give up. Instead, continuing to press forward, determined that there’s a way to help Arco get home. </p>



<p>It was this optimistic way of looking at challenges, so inherent in Bienvenu’s story, and children in general, that drew Portman to the project in the first place. The actress recalls seeing early animatics of <em>Arco</em> and talking to director Bienvenu about his vision for the film — one in which creativity and imagination can be put towards a better future for our climate. “With environmental concerns, it was [usually] an attitude of ‘it’s difficult,’ but look at what imagination can bring,’” Portman says of this perspective. “There was hope and active participation in making the future through creativity. And I thought that was a very beautiful, activating way to look at a situation that we’re often kind of fatalistic about.” </p>

<p>And rightfully so. With climate change expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year globally between 2030 and 2050, according to <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health"">data from The World Health Organization</a>(WHO), it can be easy to count ourselves – and our planet — out; resign ourselves to give up trying to change our behaviour in the present, knowing that we’re already so far gone. But, Arco — and the team behind the movie — wants us to forget about the future, or more specifically, think that they know how the future will play out. Which is why, when Iris tries to follow Arco home, he encourages her to stay in the present, stating: “No one should know the future — ever.” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>With environmental concerns, it’s usually an attitude of ‘it’s difficult,’ but look at what imagination can bring… [In Arco] there’s hope and active participation in making the future through creativity.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It seems like a surprising sentiment, given the fact most young people have grown up being told that, when it comes to the environment and climate change, the future is the only thing we should be thinking about — and how our actions now will impact our children, grandchildren and great grandchildren long after we’re gone.     </p>



<p><strong>“</strong>If you know the future, it gives you no agency in the present. You think, ‘Oh, that’s how it’s gonna be, so [there’s] nothing I can do about it,’” Portman says. “If you accept that you don’t know what the future’s going to be like, then you have a part in changing it and affecting it.”</p>



<p>Which is what we, as viewers, eventually see. While we don’t see what happens to Arco after he travels home, audiences do get a glimpse into what Iris takes from her time with her new friend; primarily, inspiration to go forth and make a difference for her own future. Through small glimpses at photos and sketches in Iris’ room, audiences see that the curious, intelligent, vivacious 10-year-old we’re first introduced to will go on to  use that curiosity and vivaciousness to try and create a better future for the planet, going on to calculate, sketch and create the more sustainable world Arco will one day inhabit. </p>



<p>It’s a lesson on the impact one person can have for both kids and viewers who are coming to the film as adults already. While <em>Arco’</em>s main audience demographic may initially seem to be those under 12-years-old, “we want to speak to the kids that are still in ourselves,” Bienvenu adds,” because we still are kids in a way; a big part of me is still a kid and I want to feed that part of myself.”</p>

<p>On November 3, Condé Nast — the media company that owns <a href=""http://vogue.com/""><em>Vogue</em></a>, <a href=""http://vanityfair.com/""><em>Vanity Fair</em></a>, <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com""><em>The New Yorker</em></a>, <a href=""https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk""><em>GQ</em></a>, and <a href=""https://www.wired.com""><em>Wired</em></a>, amongst other outlets — announced that <a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com"">Teen Vogue</a> would be absorbed into Vogue.com. The news came two months after the publication was awarded the <a href=""https://rooseveltinstitute.org/event/2025-four-freedoms-awards/"">Roosevelt Institute’s 2025 Freedom of Speech and Expression Award</a>, and followed nearly a decade’s worth of coverage of politics and other important cultural topics in a way that was relevant and accessible to a primarily Gen-Z audience. </p>



<p>Beyond its categorically political reporting, Teen Vogue was lauded for its dedication to intersectionality, and the way it approached issues impacting Black, Indigenous, and other people of color (BIPOC) and marginalized groups more generally across all its verticals. Whether that be a piece holding fashion brands to account for <a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/black-fashion-leaders-carrying-the-diversity-push-2020-2025"">diversity promises made in 2020</a>, an <a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/rfk-jrs-autism-cure-tylenol-oped"">op-ed on Robert F. Kennedy</a> and autism, or choosing transgender model and social media star, <a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/vivian-jenna-wilson-elon-musk-trans-youth"">Vivian Wilson, as its digital cover star</a> — giving her the opportunity to publicly admonish both her estranged father, Elon Musk, and his bestie, Trump. </p>



<p>The publication’s reorganization came with several notable layoffs. Editor-In-Chief <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/versharma/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Versha Sharma</a> and seven staff members lost their jobs, leaving Teen Vogue with zero Black women or trans folks on its staff. </p>



<p>In a post to her <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DQpAqOwCZm5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA=="">Instagram</a>, former Editor-In-Chief Elaine Welteroth, who presided over the magazine during its dedicated shift to political coverage circa 2015 and 2016, said the magazine “was a once-in-a-generation experiment in what happens when you hand the mic to young people from diverse backgrounds and take their voices seriously.” </p>



<p>This, against the backdrop of an industry in which just 15% of reporters who cover social issues and policy are Black, <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/04/us-journalists-beats-vary-widely-by-gender-and-other-factors/#journalists-beats-vary-somewhat-by-race-ethnicity"">according to a 2022 Pew Research study</a>. Those numbers drop to just 7% of entertainment and travel reporters, and 5% of those covering government and politics. At a time when diversity, equity, and inclusion gains are being clawed back or ignored completely in boardrooms and at a cultural level, the dismissal of such a talented newsroom begs the question: What necessary perspectives do we lose, and what questions go unasked and unanswered, when Black journalists are among the first to be seen as disposable on a masthead?</p>



<p>Among those let go at Teen Vogue last month was <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/kaitmcnab/"">Kaitlyn McNab</a>, an award-winning journalist and the outlet’s former Culture Editor. Her love for the outlet was homegrown, as it was one she regularly reached out to when she was a freelance writer, dating back to early winter 2020 when she first pitched a story for Valentine’s Day about diverse young adult love stories. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>What necessary perspectives do we lose, and what questions go unasked and unanswered, when Black journalists are among the first to be seen as disposable on a masthead?</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>“[I was pitching Black stories] every single day. That has always been at the forefront of my beat and perspective as a journalist,” says McNab, who had also overseen writing and editing for Teen Vogue’s Identity section and served as its Entertainment Editor during her five-year tenure. “A lot of the work that I’m most proud of from my time at Teen Vogue are features and interviews that allowed Black women specifically, to feel safe enough to talk about their careers, lives, and experiences and also to trust me with asking harder questions.”</p>



<p>That included an<a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/ice-spice-teen-vogue-cover-story-june-2023""> interview with rapper Ice Spice</a>, marking “one of the first where she talked to another Black woman and I think we were able to talk about things that she hadn’t touched on in other stories,” McNab explains. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/layoffs-2025-highest-level-since-2020-labor-market-jobs-report/"">layoffs are quite common</a> — 40% of workers will experience it at least once in their career.  But this current moment feels different, like it’s about more than just dollars and cents. In a year that has seen the president and his top advisors <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/sep/27/trump-free-speech-charlie-kirk"">openly attack free speech</a> and slash funding for public broadcasting, the silencing, stifling, and degradation of diverse voices via trustworthy platforms is a harbinger of a larger, more sinister cultural shift. All of this is happening at a time where companies are <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2025/04/11/ibm-reportedly-walks-back-diversity-policies-citing-inherent-tensions-here-are-all-the-companies-rolling-back-dei-programs/"">rolling back DEI initiatives</a> and the administration <a href=""https://time.com/7261857/us-companies-keep-dei-initiatives-list-trump-diversity-order-crackdown/"">threatens others</a> to do the same. At a time where harmful <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2025/11/07/how-anti-black-ai-videos-harm-black-women-at-work/"">AI-generated videos</a> of Black women using SNAP benefits continuously show up online. At a time where <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/black-women-unemployment-rate/"">Black women overall lost the most number of jobs this year</a>.   </p>



<p>“When there are economic downturns, Black workers who are the so-called professional class — which just basically means people with a college degree — actually do worse in terms of wage downturns [than their white counterparts],” says Dr. Ofronama Biu, Chief Economist and Senior Research Director at <a href=""https://www.mavencollaborative.org/"">The Maven Collaborative</a>, a Black and brown woman-led organization working to create a new, inclusive economy. </p>



<p>Black women, historically, are cultural and economic indicators. Despite participating in the workforce at a higher rate than any other demographic, unemployment rates amongst Black women have been rising at twice the rate of white and Asian women, according to the <a href=""https://19thnews.org/2025/07/black-women-unemployment-jobs-warning-sign/"">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. And after losing a job, Black women tend to remain unemployed for longer than other workers — a worrying trend that dates back to the <a href=""https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/blackadultunemploymenttwoyearsrecovery_-_august201.pdf"">Great Recession.</a> “The hit that the economy [takes] gets turned on Black workers more than their white counterparts, and even more so when they’re in the professional class,” Biu explains. </p>



<p>Yet in spite of the hardship, Black women continue to shift the <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2025/08/23/the-high-cost-of-ditching-dei-what-targets-boycott-fallout-reveals/"">economy</a> and culture. And we care deeply: about our communities, and the people in them, and the problems they face. In my opinion, writers often feel similarly because many of us entered this profession believing that it’s an honor to be entrusted with other people’s stories. And we feel a burden to handle those stories justly. But as a Black journalist, I sometimes find myself wondering: Why do we dedicate ourselves to an industry that seems so irreverent about us?</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>The hit that the economy [takes] gets turned on Black workers more than their white counterparts, and even more so when they’re in the professional class.</p><cite>Dr. Ofronama Biu, Chief Economist and Senior Research Director at The Maven Collaborative</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>This isn’t just a Condé Nast problem. Changing winds are being felt all across the industry. Earlier this year, MSNBC (owned by NBCUniversal) did its own “reshuffling,” ultimately firing Joy Reid, a prominent Black political commentator and outspoken Trump critic, and canceling her <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2025/02/25/g-s1-50551/joy-reid-msnbc-fired"">award-winning primetime show</a>. NBCUniversal struck again in October, gutting 150 staffers from NBC News and announcing it would eliminate the teams dedicated to covering <a href=""https://www.thewrap.com/nbc-news-layoffs-number-versant-split/"">marginalized issues</a>. That same month, VIBE, the long-running music magazine focused on rap, hip-hop, and R&amp;B coverage launched by music mogul Quincy Jones <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/business/business-news/vibe-rolling-stone-joining-forces-1236090544/"">announced that it would merge with Rolling Stone</a>. The statement speaks of plans to re-establish the magazine as a driving force for music reporting and amplify its presence across all platforms. It did not, however, say this: it all comes at the expense of VIBE’s almost entirely Black newsroom.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11942983.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>“I didn’t know it was coming,” says former VIBE staffer and R&amp;B reporter <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/myabriabe/"">Mya Abraham</a>. “I woke up one day and had a meeting on my calendar I thought was weird.” In that meeting, a human resources representative told Abraham that the company’s decision to restructure was not based on performance. Almost all of her colleagues, she says, got a similar call.</p>



<p>Also in October, CBS News laid off about 100 employees, including eight on-air correspondents and hosts — <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cbs-news-layoffs-eight-women-b2855655.html"">all women, half of whom are people of color</a>. Under the newly-minted leadership of Bari Weiss — a former opinion columnist who has <a href=""https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/end-dei-bari-weiss-jews"">openly called for the end of DEI programs</a> – the network also axed its Race and Culture Unit, which was created in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd and ensuing surge of Black Lives Matter protests. Established newsrooms at <a href=""https://pitchfork.com/news/rolling-stone-merges-with-vibe/"">Pitchfork</a> and <a href=""https://www.thewrap.com/huffpost-layoffs-january-2025/"">HuffPost</a> also saw substantial layoffs this year.</p>



<p>Are we noticing the pattern yet? This is not just economic anxiety — it’s cultural erasure, a rollback of DEI promises, and loss of platforms where Black and underrepresented voices are heard. The exact places where we created spaces are being dismantled. In these layoffs, we’re not just losing recipes, we’re losing cooks, and access to kitchens too.</p>



<p>Inclusion begets diversity. And diversity encourages accountability. That’s what makes these media layoffs especially troubling. As one of the most visible pathways for trusted information, the gutting of dedicated newsrooms represents the erasure of dozens of voices who can speak to BIPOC, queer, and underrepresented issues from a place of authority. Without a newsroom of writers and editors like Abraham and McNab, coverage loses its luster. What was once a kaleidoscope of perspectives runs the risk of suddenly becoming very dull. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>The exact places where we created spaces are being dismantled. In these layoffs, we’re not just losing recipes, we’re losing cooks, and access to kitchens too.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>“I asked [Ice Spice] directly about the discourse around her success, colorism, and comparisons to other female rap artists, namely Flo Milli,” McNab points out. Her cultural awareness and sensitivity made the interview better. It also reignited a necessary conversation about the music industry’s more harmful beliefs and stereotypes.</p>



<p>While publications like <a href=""https://www.essence.com"">Essence</a>, <a href=""https://www.ebony.com"">Ebony</a>, <a href=""https://www.bustle.com"">Bustle</a>, and, of course, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/unbothered"">Unbothered</a> still exist, full-time staff jobs are fewer and far between. In response to the increasing precarity of their chosen profession, many writers are choosing to put fate into their own hands. A recent <a href=""https://muckrack.com/research/state-of-creator-journalism"">study by Muck Rack</a> found that out of 1,515 surveyed journalists, more than a third of respondents independently publish their own content. Abraham will soon be one of them — she’s launching a podcast and Substack called “Play The B Sides”, dedicated to covering all things R&amp;B. McNab, though, isn’t sure the independent creator life is for her. </p>



<p>For all its flaws, the media industry “does, in a sense, give us stability,” she says. “Even though it’s so precarious, it gives us health insurance. It gives us a safety net.” For now, her immediate priority is to recuperate. “My therapist already dragged me for trying to think too far ahead. She was like, ‘You were dangerously burnt out and you need to take this time to rest right now.’”</p>



<p>Any work (no matter how glamorous the ‘00s rom-com makes it seem) is a job. It can be stressful, but it also provides a steady source of income. When that suddenly vanishes, there’s so much to practically consider: severance packages, contracts, figuring out how — or if — you’re going to be able to afford your life moving forward. Given the <a href=""https://www.brookings.edu/articles/disparities-for-women-and-minorities-in-retirement-saving/"">disparities for Black women</a> and other minorities regarding savings accounts and other safety nets, the loss of even one paycheck can feel catastrophic. After all, it’s hard to save money for the future when you’re being paid significantly less than your white counterparts to begin with. </p>



<p>For her part, Abraham started a <a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-vibe-staff-after-layoffs"">GoFundMe</a> for herself and her ex-colleagues as they begin to figure out next steps. Despite receiving more than 21,000 views on X (formerly Twitter), the effort has only raised $1,100 of a $35,000 total goal. When I asked if she’s disappointed by that, she admits she is. “I’m just like, ‘OK, how hard do I have to fight to get this goal met?’,” she says. “There is still a whole team of Black journalists who don’t have a job anymore.” </p>



<p>But as a self-described optimist, Abraham remains hopeful — for her future, for the industry she loves, and most importantly, for her community. </p>



<p>“I’m just here to support everybody Black,” she says, invoking a now-famous Issa Rae quote. “That’s all I want to do — support Black things because we deserve it. We are the driving force of the culture. And I just want the world to remember that.”</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11942861.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>When it comes to legacy beauty founders’ second acts, Carisa Janes is in excellent company. From Bobbi Brown’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jones-road-beauty-makeup-review"">Jones Road</a> to Ali Webb’s Messy (her sophomore endeavor following Drybar), some of the most exciting beauty brands of the moment are coming from longtime tastemakers. </p>



<p>With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vegan-makeup-hourglass"">Hourglass</a>, Janes famously honed a luxury makeup POV with a focus on lit-from-within, sculpted skin powered by baked Ambient light powders that made the brand a household name. With her latest venture, <a href=""https://theoutsidein.com/"">Outside In</a>, she’s not just creating more product for products’ sake. The brand is launching with just three products, a <a href=""https://theoutsidein.com/products/silk-serum-foundation?variant=45146880573628"">Silk Serum Foundation</a>, an <a href=""https://theoutsidein.com/products/serum-foundation-brush?variant=45374288527548"">accompanying brush</a>, and <a href=""https://theoutsidein.com/products/floral-reserve-face-oil?variant=45384314257596"">Floral Reserve Face Oil</a>. </p>



<p>The foundation notably features skincare-grade levels of active ingredients like niacinamide and hyaluronic acid, and the face oil features a base of sweet almond, sunflower seed, and meadowfoam seed oils. “I really want to surprise,” Janes says. “That’s what that drives me the most with Hourglass and Outside In: the opportunity to create something special.” </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11942860.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>Let’s start with the foundation: IMO, it’s much more of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-skin-tint-foundation"">skin tint</a> (but a <em>really</em> good one) than actual foundation, since it looks virtually undetectable on skin and actually feels like hydrating skincare that happens to have pigment in the formula. Available in 25 sheer shades, the formula combines the dewiness of a hydrating serum base with light-diffusing spherical powders for a visibly even complexion with a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/blur-makeup-trend-products"">blurred, soft-focus effect</a>. And while the bottle looks and feels incredibly luxe, it’s secretly sustainable, too. “What took the longest [in the process] was actually the packaging because it’s made from a rice husk-derived biomaterial, and recycled glass,” Janes tells me. The result? A beautiful, stone-like texture that you’ll want to proudly leave on countertops.</p>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-face-oil"">Face oils</a> might be relegated to a final step of skincare to “lock in” preceding products, but not this one. Janes loves using this as a primer (!) for Silk Serum Foundation to create a hydrated, glowy base that doesn’t require illuminating products. (Which, ironically, one could say she has mastered with Hourglass.) “I want to challenge myself to create really unique products,” she tells me. Think: Vegan brushes with a limestone composite handle and a forthcoming brick-and-mortar store that brings an experiential aspect of the brand to life. (If the packaging doesn’t give it away, Janes is passionate about design and world-building via her products.) </p>





<p>Priced at $64 for the foundation, $52 for the brush, and $72 for the face oil, these are as far from cheap thrills as it gets. But just as you might invest in a luxury candle for your home or an investment coat to wear all season long, Janes is hoping to inspire a sort of keepsake-like longevity with Outside In. “I want the customer to have that feeling of desirability and like, ‘<em>This is something I really cherish and love</em>,'” Janes says. “That’s what I’m trying to do with every product launch with Outside In.”</p>

<p>The holiday season is upon us, and with that, the arrival of the biggest shopping day of the year: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-friday"">Black Friday</a>. While we may hotly debate when it’s acceptable to blast “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” there’s one early arrival we can all agree on: the best Black Friday deals.</p>



<p>All of your favorite retailers have rolled out all their Black Friday deals, making now the time to score top-rated products you’ve been eyeing (or planning to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-gift-guides"">gift someone special</a>) for a fraction of the price. We’ve rounded up all the must-know sales for a successful — and wallet-friendly — Black Friday 2025. Read on below for our guide to the smartest savings — from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-friday-clothing-deals"">highly-coveted fashion markdowns </a>to steep cuts on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-friday-mattress-deals"">mattresses and bedding</a> — happening now.</p>



<h2>What is Black Friday?</h2>



<p>Black Friday lands the day after Thanksgiving (this year, it’s November 28). But it’s far from a single-day event. It’s now a mega-shopping marathon kicking off as early as October and continuing through early December, along with its sister sale, Cyber Monday. </p>



<h2>When do Black Friday deals start?</h2>



<p>Early Black Friday sales are already underway and will continue to ramp up throughout the month. (Remember, it’s a marathon, not a sprint!)</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/athleta-simone-biles-collaboration-interview"">Simone Biles</a> isn’t ready to get back in the gym yet. The Olympic gold medallist is the most decorated gymnast of all time and undoubtedly one of the most dominant and greatest athletes to ever grace sports, but these days, she’s taking time for herself. After competing for 22 years, <a href=""https://people.com/simone-biles-reveals-daring-sport-shes-learning-during-gymnastics-break-exclusive-11847531"">Biles is on a “break”</a> from gymnastics. Now, she’s focusing on hobbies like horseback riding, ice skating, pilates and long walks with her husband, Chicago Bears safety, <a href=""https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4331768/jonathan-owens"">Jonathan Owens</a>. On NFL game day, you can find her on the field giving <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/YahooSports/posts/simone-biles-out-in-the-chicago-snow-supporting-her-husband-jonathan-owens-%EF%B8%8F/1433346048154147/"">Owens a good luck kiss</a> (his one pre-game superstition) and showing out in various football-appropriate ‘fits. </p>



<p>Lately, football Sunday has turned into a who’s who of <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/what-are-wags-rcna124752"">WAGs (wives and girlfriends)</a> — celebs like <a href=""https://www.sportskeeda.com/nfl/news-russell-wilson-s-wife-ciara-channels-james-bond-s-007-energy-faux-leather-bodycon-slit-dress"">Ciara</a>, <a href=""https://www.eonline.com/ca/news/1424616/hailee-steinfeld-on-josh-allen-marriage"">Hailee Steinfeld,</a> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/cuffing-season-taylor-swift-travis-kelce"">Taylor Swift</a>, and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DHM2vZWJ9Tq/?hl=en"">Normani</a> are all partnered up with players — and their fashion makes weekly headlines. For Biles, game days are “so fun” but over Zoom, she says the attention is stressful: “I wish we didn’t have to walk the runway so much. I’m just there supporting my man.” It’s a good thing <a href=""https://athleta.gap.com/browse/info.do?cid=3034725"">Biles has her own collection with Athleta</a> to keep her looking good on game days. She even teased a custom Athleta look for the Bears’ upcoming faceoff against the Minnesota Vikings this weekend.</p>



<p>Biles and Athleta have been partnering for years but this marks the Olympian’s second women’s <em>and</em> girls’ collection for the activewear brand. Like her last Athleta collab, the collection is affordable, size inclusive, and includes intergenerational styles as well as accessories. Whether you’re looking for soft hoodies, performance-ready tights (Biles told R29 that the <a href=""https://athleta.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=583530002&amp;vid=1&amp;searchText=Elation%207%2F8%20Tight#pdp-page-content"">Elation Ultra High Rise Shine 7/8 Legging</a> is one of her all-time favorites), barrel-leg sweats, or a new <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/womens-fall-jackets"">fall jacket</a> (the <a href=""https://athleta.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=583465002&amp;vid=1&amp;searchText=sateen%20bomber#pdp-page-content"">Sateen Bomber</a> is another Biles must-have), Biles has you covered with pieces that are deserving of a game-day catwalk. </p>



<p>Throughout our chat, Biles’ excitement for the collection is palpable but so is her joy for this current moment in her life. She’s letting herself be bad at things (“I’m learning every day!” she says) and she’s soaking in a softer, more “selfish” life. To put it simply, Biles seems <em>free</em>. It’s beautiful to behold, and even more inspiring that the woman who landed the hardest vault in the world so flawlessly that <a href=""https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/sports/simone-biles-nails-yurchenko-double-pike-vault-at-world-championships-now-named-after-her/4730964/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">they renamed it after</a> her is now happily losing at darts to her friends. After all of Biles’ <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/08/10611521/simone-biles-statement-mental-health-olympics"">public mental health struggles</a>, the normal, quiet contentment she describes to me feels like her biggest win yet. </p>



<p>Here, she talks more about her Athleta collection, how she <em>really</em> feels about being called a “WAG”, and supporting her friend and former teammate <a href=""https://www.intlgymnast.com/main/jordan-chiles-cha-cha-chas-her-way-to-dancing-with-the-stars-semifinals/"">Jordan Chiles on<em> Dancing With The Stars. </em></a></p>



<p><strong>Refinery29 Unbothered: Congrats on the collection! The pieces look so comfortable and chic. Tell me about this collection and how it aligns with how you approach working out.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone Biles:</strong> It’s very different. It’s the boldest collection that we’ve had thus far. I’m obviously biased, but this is one of my favorite collections. We have followed some of the trends but really, I always say, that you can take it from the mat to conferences or whatever it is. It doesn’t have to be just for the gym. It’s my go-to travel style, as well as if I’m taking a pilates class with my husband. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11942663.png?width=767&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=767%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p><strong>What are the pieces in the collection that everyone needs?</strong></p>



<p><strong>SB:</strong> There’s a couple. I’m going to start with the <a href=""https://athleta.gap.com/browse/sale/sale-accessories?cid=50012"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">sateen bucket bag</a>. That is just such a fashionable piece. It’s just a really cute accessory. And I think people are going to love to layer it, as well as the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shop/product/elation-ultra-high-rise-shine-7-8-legging-11781706"">Elation Shine Leggings</a>, those have a subtle zebra print, which you can’t really tell until you’re up close. It just adds something extra without being overpowering. That’s really, really cute and fashionable. We have the sateen bomber jacket that in the fall and the winter, I just put over everything. We also have the <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBos7DTS2Nb/"">Forever Fleece sweatpants,</a> which are a barrel leg, and that is just so fun. What I love about Athleta so much is that everyone can wear it. We try to be inclusive — there’s extra extra small, all the way to extra large, as well as tall and petite sizing. And for me, at 4’8, that’s perfect. But then we got my girl, [Olympic swimmer] <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/katieledecky/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Katie Ledecky,</a> over here, wearing tall. We don’t want it to be one size fits all. We want everyone to be able to rock it, especially through this fall and this winter weather. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>At the end of the day, I don’t just have to be a gymnast. I can do it all because I’ve seen <em>us</em> do it all.</p><cite>simone biles</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>For so many of us, working out and going to the gym is a hobby or something we do to stay healthy. For you, it’s been your job. How do you separate the work of staying active from the joy of it and doing it just because it makes you feel good? </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB:</strong> Now, I’ve started to explore other hobbies that still include working out, but it just looks a little bit different. Right now, although I’m not in the gym 24/7, I’m in my horseback riding lessons, and I’m about to pick up ice skating lessons because I feel like gymnastics, although it was working out, it was just it was so much fun for me and you don’t even realize you’re exercising. So I wanted to feel that similar feeling. I took up horseback riding because going to a gym for me and doing pilates and all that stuff seems a little bit scary and daunting, but if you put it as a hobby, and say “I’m working out for an hour or so,” it feels a little bit easier. I’m about to start doing my ice skating lessons. I’ve already called the ice rink. I know they’re tired of hearing from me<em> [laughs]. </em></p>



<p><strong>What made you decide to do ice skating?</strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>The ​​rink is literally three minutes from my house and since I pass it all the time going to and from the airport, I’m like,<em> okay, that’s going to be a fun, little hobby.</em> I walk my dog and I have a weighted vest but just going on walks and seeing the leaves change in the fall is also fun for me. I don’t think I’m ready to just get into a gym just yet, unless it’s a girls’ activity and we’re doing pilates or we’re doing something cute. I don’t think I’m ready. I still want to have fun with it. Just random sidequests. </p>



<p><strong>I’m Canadian so I love to see Black girls doing winter sports. </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>Yes! We can do it all. I’ve never seen as much representation as I have these days, and it’s so exciting. It’s inspiring me. At the end of the day, I don’t just have to be a gymnast. I can do it all because I’ve seen <em>us</em> do it all.</p>



<p><strong>Yes, you can. One thing we love seeing you do is show up on NFL game days supporting your husband. Will we be seeing a custom Athleta game day set soon?</strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>Yeah! It’s coming soon. We’re planning on not this weekend but the next weekend in Minnesota. A little custom bomber going on, okay! Got a little custom action coming. </p>



<p><strong>Take me through what goes on behind your game-day fashion. How do you put your outfits together for games? </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB:</strong> I really try to base it on the weather and where they’re playing. My husband wants me to wear more navy and orange [for the team’s colors], but I’m always going with the blacks and the whites and the grays and the neutrals. I’m trying to implement a little bit more of the Bears’ colors. But other than that, I really base it off of the weather. I know later this year when we play in San Francisco, you can get a little bit more cute and fashionable, because for me, with my height, it’s so hard to be cute and look fashionable [in the cold] when I’m just going to walk around looking like a marshmallow. I try to implement certain things like that. But definitely, we have a couple things coming, and so I’m really excited about that. But weather first and foremost, and comfortability, comfortability, comfortability! And movement! </p>



<p><strong>I saw a headline today that said: ‘Is Simone Biles NFL’s Best WAG?’ How do you feel about that title? </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>I don’t know about that! We still got Ciara, we got Normani. We can all fit in that space! There’s room for all of us. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11942671.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>It feels like there’s so much attention on WAGs, specifically football wives and girlfriends. How do you feel about the term WAG and being a part of that club with, as you said, with Ciara and Normani, and then there’s [Hailee Steinfeld and Taylor Swift] and all these people?</strong></p>



<p><strong>SB:</strong> I don’t mind the word WAG, because really, I’m just showing up and supporting my husband. Although the fashion is so much fun to do, I’m really just there to go support my man, and that is really important that we get to show up and support one another. We’re always working so hard, and we have a limited amount of time with each other. We don’t know how long each of us are going to be professional athletes playing on a stage like this. So it’s really just fun for everyone to show up and support. I don’t mind sharing the space. </p>



<p>It’s so much fun. But again, there are a lot of eyes. I can wear a sweatsuit like this to a game, but I was telling my husband that every time I go on the field, even though I’m just supporting you, photos are everywhere. And that part stresses me out, because I just want to be relaxed. At the last game, I just did a messy bun, a sweat suit, and that was that. But you always have to pop off and I wish we didn’t. I wish we didn’t have to walk the runway so much. I’m just there supporting my man, but I know how much it is going to be highlighted.</p>



<p><strong>I can imagine that it gets stressful, especially because it’s every week. </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>I’m only on the field because that’s my husband’s good luck thing. He knows that he has to have me on the sideline. He said that’s his one thing. He’s not superstitious at all, but he’s like, “I know I have to have my girl on the field, get that good luck kiss, and then we’re good.” If not, y’all would never see me down there. I would be up in the stands hiding like y’all would never see me. But that’s my husband’s thing so that’s why I do it. </p>



<p><strong>That is really sweet!</strong></p>



<p><strong>SB:</strong> I’d be hiding. I don’t like the attention — never have, and maybe never will. That stuff stresses me out so bad, I will be hiding as much as possible. I don’t like all of this attention but you get used to it, I guess. But it’s stress! Anxiety! I just want to just go do my thing and watch in peace and quiet. Next year, I think I’m going to stay home for the away games. I just can’t do it. I’m just so stressed. There’s a lot of behind-the-scenes logistics that goes into it as well. It’s not the easiest to try to get me into a stadium, either.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> It’s really important to listen to your body and your mind, because that literally can change the trajectory of your life. Be selfish, show up for yourself. </p><cite>simone biles </cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>Speaking of stress, I’m also an anxious girlie. We’re Unbothered so we always like to do a Black girl mental health check in. You’ve been so outspoken about mental health and the importance of therapy, especially Therapy Thursdays. Is there a piece of advice or something you’ve learned in therapy that you can share with us, with our audience, who are mostly Black women? Give us some energy! We need it! </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>I would say the one piece of advice that I have is you have to take that mental time to yourself and those personal days, because it really does change how you feel, talk about yourself, what your life looks like. So I would say, take those personal days. It’s really important to stay in tune and to listen to your body and your mind, because that literally can change the trajectory of your life. Be selfish, show up for yourself. We’re so in tune with showing up for everyone else, but at the end of the day, we neglect a little bit of our personal space and our well being. You have to show up for yourself first and foremost. Put on your favorite tunes, some Cardi B. Women are so powerful. We can do anything we put our minds to. And showing up for yourself is a win. We have to put ourselves first.</p>



<p><strong>One of the things that is so inspiring about you is that you are the best. And in being the best gymnast in the world, the best athlete in the world, you inspire me to think I can be the best at what I do. But I also think of the pressure or expectation that comes with that. What’s something you’re just OK at, and is there freedom in being mediocre sometimes? </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>Every day with me and my husband, we’re learning new recipes. Since I’ve done my craft for so long, over 22 years, it’s really hard for me. I love learning new things, but I’m always learning, and keen to keep learning. It never ends. I’m learning every day. I know I’m not going to be the best at it. We even did a wine and sip the other day. Did my painting look the best? Absolutely not. But I don’t care. I’m not trying to be the best. I didn’t train 22 years to paint so it looks like what it looks like, and every day when I’m doing new recipes in the house, because now I love to cook, I love to cook, it’s OK. </p>



<p>I’m even trying to get better at my makeup and my hair. I was just bugging one of my makeup artists yesterday, like, girl, you really try not to have me be great at makeup, because I keep asking you to send me the tutorial, and she finally sent it to me yesterday. So now today, I’m going to go look at it, and I’m going to go practice my makeup. We always have more to learn. I’m okay with that. I love playing darts. I love playing ping pong. At our new house, which we sign for next week, we have a ping pong table and a dart board. Am I the best at it? No, but it’s about making memories, having fun and just still learning.</p>



<p><strong>I love that but I can also picture the competitive spirit in you trying to come out at the paint and sip. </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>You know, that’s actually so funny, because everyone thinks I’m going to be so competitive at whatever we do, but I literally don’t care if I’m last place. Every time, I’m still going to play, I’m still going to have a good spirit, good energy, because it’s about making those memories. Obviously for them, they’re like, “I beat Simone Biles at something!” I don’t care. I don’t care. Let’s just have a good time. Let’s kiki, have a good time, good conversation, good vibes, good energy. And that’s a win in my book, because we’re not going to be good at everything. I’m incredibly gifted, and to do what I do every day has been such a blessing and to come out on top. But I also know that’s not normal. I know that’s very rare. So I’m just incredibly blessed and thankful. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11942670.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>That’s inspiring that Simone Biles can be so chill about losing or being bad at something. </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>Yeah, well I never wanted to be the best at gymnastics. I just wanted to go to college, hopefully get a college scholarship, and that was it. Obviously, the cards fell in place, and I got to do way more than my wildest dreams. But even as a young girl, did I want to go to the Olympics? No. Every one of my teammates said that. So I said it. I don’t even know what the Olympics was. I saw it in 2008 on the TV. And I was like, <em>Whoa. How’d they do that? </em>But I didn’t even want to go there. At that point. I saw the girls [gymnastics team] and they went to Italy. And I was like, <em>how do I go to Italy? I want to compete in Italy. </em>I never wanted to go to the Olympics. You just dream big and dream bigger.</p>



<p><strong>You were dreaming dreams you didn’t even know you had. Speaking of your teammates, you competed on Dancing with the Stars and now so is Jordan Chiles. She’s killing it. Are you watching? How proud of Jordan are you?</strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>Oh my god, I’m so proud of her. She’s totally in her element. This is what she was made to do. She’s always been an entertainer, and obviously that goes hand-in-hand with gymnastics. On floor [routines], we do have to entertain a little bit, but this is her space completely. And she gets to be 100% herself. People get to see her personality shine. It’s a little glimpse of what we’ve gotten to see over the past couple of years, but now she gets to share it with the whole world.</p>



<p><strong>Did you give her any advice going into the season? </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>She needed no advice. She is so confident in who she is, and her personality is so big. I was too shy for that. Now I think I’m a little bit more comfortable in who I am, but this is perfect for her. So there was no advice, just “good luck, have fun.” And I told her, “you’re going to be on that show one day.” And she’s like, “No, I don’t think so.” Girl, look at you now! I said “they’re going to keep asking you and bugging you to do it.” And she’s like, “No, I don’t think so.” And now she’s like, “why are you always right?” I know these things. It’s like a sixth sense.</p>



<p><strong>I love being the friend who’s always right. </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB:</strong> Yeah, I get badgered about that a lot. “You’re just always right!” OK. And am! </p>

Here, in this personal essay, as told to Andrea Cheng, she opens up and gets vulnerable about her wellness journey, her new approach to health and fitness, and how the Ninja BlendBOSS™ seamlessly fits into her everyday routine.  </em></p>



<p>Two years ago, I was in a pretty bad place. I cried, like, every day. Not that you’d know it — I appeared on millions of Americans’ TV screens every Monday night with a smile plastered on my face, reminding everyone that summer should be fun. I was thrust into the national spotlight after being cast in a reality show. There, I met (and started dating) a man who was just…not very nice to me. But sometimes <em>really</em> nice. And then really <em>not</em> nice again. I think the kids call it a “toxic relationship.” So I was navigating that, which left me in a spiral of insecurity and depression and anxiety, and simultaneously dealing with snarky commentary from the millions of people watching it play out.</p>



<p>I felt like I was under a magnifying glass, with everyone on earth seeing the worst parts of my life up close. All I could think about was how I was perceived, so I started living my life according to what I thought these people thought of me. In short, I was living two lives: one of red carpets and toothy grins, which mostly felt disingenuous — and one that was more honest, but totally miserable. It was only when my relationship ended that I realized how much of a toll it had taken on me, both physically and mentally. There wasn’t anything wrong with <em>me</em>, I realized — there was something wrong with…well, <em>that</em>. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941604.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>So I decided to embark on a healing journey (insert sparkle emojis here). In November 2023, I overhauled my life, determined to “do the work.” Signs of trauma had already shown up in my body: I was inflamed, I was bloated, and my skin was breaking out. I researched anti-inflammatory nutrition and changed my workout routine accordingly. I took care of my inner self: I went to therapy, I journaled, I unpacked some hard stuff, I took breaks from social media, I spent quality time with friends and family. </p>



<p>Throughout this two-year journey, I learned to prioritize my mental and physical health. But the biggest takeaway was learning about health in a whole new light — one that’s not entirely accessible nor intuitive. There’s a dearth of health information written by women, for women, and about women. For example: the importance of lifting weights. I’m on a body recomposition journey (sounds intimidating, I know, but hear me out) that’s basically an effort to eat more protein, carbohydrates, and fats. All it really means is that I’m trying to gain muscle, because skeletal muscle mass is directly correlated to how long we live. Simply put: I want to be strong. I want to build muscle so that I can live longer, so that I can pick things up, so that I don’t get injured when I work out. So that even if my heart gets broken, my mind and body remain in one piece.</p>



<p>And to be completely honest, I can’t do it without my <a href=""https://www.sharkninja.com/ninja-blendboss-tumbler-blender-with-26oz-travel-tumbler-cyberspace/DB301CCY.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ninja BlendBOSS™</a>. I’ve always been a smoothie girly, but my protein shakes have become an integral part of my daily routine, especially once I discovered that I needed to drastically up my protein intake. Now I can hardly make it out the door without my stomach growling if I don’t start my morning by blending up a protein shake (mine tastes like dessert, I swear), and I can’t recover afterwards without my 100 ounces of water, powdered supplements, or my homemade electrolyte concoction.</p>



<p>The Ninja BlendBOSS™ is kind of like an everything-in-one product — it’s a blender, a tumbler, a bottle, conveniently housed in an easy-to-use (and super chic) vessel. It’s for the busy mom on the go, for the hydration queen whose emotional support object is her water bottle (me), for the fitness It girl who doesn’t like stray from her routine (also me). </p>



<p>If you’ve never fueled with a goal in mind, it’s hard to even understand what kind of a lifesaver this is. I always do a big existential sigh when women say they avoid lifting weights because they’re “afraid of getting bulky.” If only they knew how much food they’d have to eat to achieve such a thing. Since I’m trying to hit 125g of protein, 225g of carbs, and 50g of fat, adding protein powder, peanut butter, bananas, and Greek yogurt into a shake allows me to consume at <em>least</em> 30g of protein before I’m even out the door in the morning. Thanks to the Ninja BlendBOSS™, I’m hitting my numbers in a way that’s healthy <em>and</em> enjoyable. </p>



<p>For almost all my life, the driving force when it came to my physical appearance was to look a certain way for other people, to fit what I thought was the beauty standard…which, to be blunt, was skinny. As a kid, with my blonde hair and blue eyes, I grew up hearing that I looked like a doll, and I spent my whole life feeling like I was supposed to look the part. That meant being a size double zero, having visible abs, and making sure my hair, makeup, and nails were always done. </p>



<p>I should mention that I was a ballerina growing up, with the plan to go pro (I lost out to a career-ending injury at 16). Anyone who’s ever done ballet will know that many studios are breeding grounds for body image issues. Clad in light pink leotards and tights, dancers almost invariably hear “I can see your lunch,” (as in…they can see your stomach) more times than they hear “great work” before the age of 13.</p>



<p>Historically, women are trained to think that getting in shape means losing weight — and losing weight means more cardio and less food. For so long, that was <em>my</em> mindset, too. I used to frequent HIIT classes, which are optimized for higher heart rates and dropping pounds. But two of my trainers over the years — Taylor Rae Roman and Madison Feeney — both of whom I now consider friends, reshaped my thinking. Through them, I learned to prioritize strong over skinny.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941605.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>I’ll confess: When I first set out to build muscle, I was terrified. As a dancer, creator, and public figure, I’ve always been hyper-aware of what my body looked and felt like. I thought: <em>What if I look in the mirror and don’t recognize myself? </em>I already know that there will be times I pick myself apart — pinching parts of me, second-guessing, and worrying what other people think. Those are habits you don’t unlearn in a day.</p>



<p>But the motivation to do this is for myself — not for other people. And it’s not easy, but if I’ve learned anything on this journey, it’s that <em>everything</em> worth doing is hard. Already, I’m seeing a difference. Just this morning, I noticed that my body looked a little bigger. But I also noticed something more important, more exciting: the voice inside my head that shouted out my wins drowned out the voice that whispered my fears. I picked up a 45-pound weight instead of a 40-pound one. I climbed the five flights of stairs to my apartment without feeling out of breath. I felt hungry for every meal, because, finally, I’m supporting my body with nutrients in a way that actually makes my metabolism go faster. It all feels so rewarding and encouraging, because it’s how your body is<em> supposed</em> to operate. To the untrained eye, these changes are too subtle to notice, but they’re a big deal to me.</p>



<p>You know the saying, “You have to love yourself before someone else can love you”? I really used to think it was BS. But I must say: I’m not sure it’s a coincidence that the first time I started to love myself — six-ish months into my healing journey — is also when my boyfriend and I started dating. And I don’t think it’s a coincidence that this is the healthiest, happiest relationship I’ve ever known. Every single thing that’s good in your life comes from loving yourself. If you take care of yourself, you can feel strong, powerful. Beautiful. Lovable.</p>



<p>Anyway, if you’ve made it this far, you must be wondering where I’ve ended up. To answer your question: I’m still in it. Because despite society convincing us that there’s a “before” and “after” for every journey, the truth is: It’s never really over. But I have settled on my destination. After all this soul searching, this healing, I feel like it’s my duty to share this message with other women who are going through the same things. I know how many of them are 30 minutes into their excruciating spin classes, thinking, <em>If I’m just one inch smaller, maybe someone will love me</em>. I’ve been there. I know what it’s like to outsource your identity and self-respect to the opinions of others. It sucks. So if I can help even one person change that mindset, or even pursue a goal of being stronger and healthier for <em>themselves</em>, and no one else…then I’d go through all the pain again, so we could find ourselves here, together, now. It would all be worth it.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/05/louvre-heist-suspect-is-social-media-star-and-former-museum-security-guard-reports-say"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Louvre heist</a> was not just an elaborate stunt dreamed up by the <em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E3lMRx7HRQ"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Now You See Me: Now You Don’t</a> </em>marketing team to promote the third instalment of the franchise. Well, we’re pretty sure it wasn’t. “No comment,” the film’s stars <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/rosamund-pike-marie-curie-likeability"">Rosamund Pike</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmeMa1-VaUk"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ariana Greenblatt</a>, and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/islafisher/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Isla Fisher</a> respond in unison when I ask them to clear up the rumors once and for all. The trio is sitting side by side (by side) in New York City during the movie’s press junket and their easy rapport and deadpan comedic timing is as pitch perfect offscreen as it is on the big screen. </p>



<p><em><a href=""https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/now-you-see-me-now-you-dont-review-jesse-eisenberg-1236573734/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Now You See Me: Now You Don’t</a> </em>reunites Fisher with original cast members <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LM5aUZaAHQ"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jesse Eisenberg</a>, <a href=""https://people.com/dave-franco-says-he-peaked-with-sexiest-cat-dad-title-11847335"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dave Franco</a>, and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/woodyharrelson/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Woody Harrelson</a> as the OG four horsemen, a team of magicians who also do heists. In this sequel, they reunite to recruit three new illusionists (Greenblatt, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dominic.sessa/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dominic Sessa</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2aos_Xvq1H/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Justice Smith</a>) for their toughest job yet: the theft of the world’s biggest diamond. The timing of the release has made for some <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DQF0cdDgfRX/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">hilarious memes</a> as the internet continues to revel in the absurdity and fantasy of the real-life Louvre heist. In a time when <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/business/us-unemployment-rate-near-4-year-high-labor-market-hits-stall-speed-2025-09-05/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">unemployment is on the rise</a> and the rich are running amok and wreaking havoc on the poor — and the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/11/us-supreme-court-trump-snap-food-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">social services in place to support them</a> — who doesn’t love the idea of rogue rascals sticking it to a bougie institution by running off with its crown jewels? That’s exactly what you see, and get, with <em>Now You See Me: Now You Don’t. </em></p>



<p>Fittingly, the movie’s big bad villain is a white South African named Veronika Vanderberg (played by Pike who is having the time of her life as the delightfully devilish foe) and it’s full of the escapist eat-the-rich energy that seems to be permeating the zeitgeist now more than ever (recession indicator). Plus, the movie is about as anti-capitalist and anti-billionaire as a popcorn flick about magicians can be. </p>



<p>“Everyone needs a little bit of magic right now,” Fisher says when I ask about the film’s anarchist spirit. She’s right. This instalment is just as silly and entertaining as the previous two (with another twist you won’t see coming), which is exactly the vibe it feels like audiences are craving. And these three women from different generations who occupy three very different spaces in Hollywood — the Gen Z rising star (Greenblatt), the comedy queen primed for a comeback (Fisher), and the Oscar-nominated powerhouse (Pike) — are the perfect trio to pull off the impossible: sprinkling a little joy onto our timelines. </p>



<p>Here, along with gushing over Greenblatt, the stars talk about bonding with the stacked cast, the illusion of Hollywood, and decide which pop stars would make the best magicians. </p>



<p><strong>Refinery29: Isla, you are returning to this franchise after a decade while Rosamund and Ariana are new to it. How did you welcome the new cast to this world and did you give them any advice? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Isla Fisher: </strong>At the beginning, it was quite interesting. There was a bit of a divide. There were the old horsemen and we would go to set on time, no offense. Oh, we’d stand on our marks waiting, and we’d wait for the new ponies to show up, and they would be very suspicious of us and use words like “rizz” and “slay,” which we didn’t understand [<em>laughs</em>]. Then, finally, I think it was the time that actually <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/morganfreeman/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Morgan Freeman</a> showed up on set that we were able to join together, and then we became the best of friends. All of us get on so well and it suddenly went from being two organisms to one loving family.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> She’s so forward thinking, she’s so progressive, she’s such a feminist…. Who is this magical unicorn that exists?</p><cite>isla fisher on ariana greenblatt</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>Rosamund Pike: </strong>That’s the first day I showed up on set and I didn’t know [what to expect]. </p>



<p><strong>IF: </strong>I knew, and have always been a massive fan of [Rosamund’s] so I was so excited that she was joining us, because obviously she’s the most brilliant actor. I felt very comfortable right away with her. </p>



<p><strong>Ariana Greenblatt:</strong> Justice [Smith] and I were so excited the day [Rosamund] showed up. So excited [and] so nervous. It was the queen arriving. Justice and I have this ongoing competition for your love that you don’t know about. </p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> Well, you came to my play so you’re winning.</p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>I supported her when I was in London, and it was the best thing ever. But yeah, I feel like Dominic [Sessa], Justice, and I were equally nervous to join this already existing family. And they really welcomed us with open arms. And it was a quick bond. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11942505.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>Rosamund Pike as Veronika in Now You See Me: Now You Don’t. Photo Credit: Katalin Vermes</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Rosamund, your character Veronika Vanderberg is such a good villain. You’re very good at playing characters we love to hate like in <em>I Care A Lot </em></strong><strong>and<em> Gone Girl,</em></strong><strong> for example. What is it about those roles that you are drawn to? </strong></p>



<p><strong>RP</strong>: I hesitated to do this because I thought, <em>maybe nobody needs to see me do that again</em>. And then I realized it wasn’t exactly again, because Veronica is different. I mean, basically because she’s got a different accent, which is good enough for me [<em>laughs</em>]. Once I decided that she could sound different, I thought,<em> yeah, I’m going to do this</em>. Ruben [Fleischer], our director, promised that I would have a great time on this film and people say that, but he was absolutely right. We had a great time. I was sad to leave it behind. These guys need a good adversary, don’t they? And with Veronica, I was interested in whipping her character into a shape where she was having fun, and then I hoped that an audience would have fun watching her demise, because the more arrogant she can be, and the more pleasure she’s taking in herself for the longest time, then the greater the glee when you know she falls apart if she does. </p>



<p><strong>Ariana, your character June has this great, dry, dark sense of humor. She’s really smart but constantly underestimated because of her size and she’s a young girl. Why do you think teen girls are consistently underestimated and what did you enjoy about getting to explore that? </strong></p>



<p><strong>AG:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. It’s an unfortunate male-dominated world and they see a five-foot girl and they’re like, <em>you can do nothing</em>. June is the definition of underestimated. She doesn’t flaunt what she can do, and she doesn’t really have to prove anything loudly to people. She just kind of lets it speak for herself when needed. And I think that was the most fun for me with June. When the time comes and when there’s danger ahead, she’s good. She doesn’t need anybody else. That was really fun.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>It’s an unfortunate male-dominated world and they see a five-foot girl and they’re like, <em>you can do nothing</em>.</p><cite>ariana greenblatt</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> And she did a lot of stunts. I’m just gonna, like, blow her up for a minute. [Ariana] is the most precise stunt person.<em> [Ariana laughs]. </em>You don’t laugh at this! This is genuine. What she can physically do — her prowess in the fight sequences that she does in this movie were amazing. I’ve seen her do it in other films, but seeing you do it on set, and watching you, particularly when you climb the wall and just you’re deeply athletic, which is, of course, impressive, but it translates into her stunts being another level. It was so cool to watch. You could be like Tomb Raider! </p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> It’s precision and power and accuracy. </p>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> Yeah! And it’s control. It’s also bravery. You have to silence that inner voice to really perform it. And she does it perfectly.</p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>Thank you. </p>



<p><strong>RP: </strong> And you look cool doing it, whereas I think I can do stuff like that but when I do it, I just don’t look cool. </p>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> Yeah, it’s a wedgie for mom, it doesn’t go well for us. It’s just bingo wings and wedgies [<em>laughs</em>]. No one wants that.</p>



<p><strong>AG:  </strong>Thank you. I appreciate it. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11942511.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=428&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=256%3A107"" /><figcaption>Dominic Sessa as Bosco, Justice Smith as Charlie, and Ariana Greenblatt as June in Now You See Me: Now You Don’t.

<p><strong>Isla and Rosamund, listening to you talk and hype up Ariana, I want to know if there’s something you wish you knew at Ariana’s age that you would go back and tell your younger selves?</strong></p>



<p><strong>RP: </strong>Everything. </p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>Everything. But she already knows it. And I knew that about her before I even met her, because I have daughters. And they would give me Ariana quotes and I’d say, “Who said that?” And they’re like “Mommy, the actress from Barbie. She’s so forward thinking, she’s so progressive, she’s such a feminist.” And I was like, “Who is this magical unicorn that exists?” Back in our day, we used to talk about which boys liked us, and it was just so brilliant to meet her and have the wealth of her very unique perspective. She’s such an original thinker. She lives her life authentically. I’m sorry, this has turned into a talk show about you<em> [laughs]. </em></p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> I didn’t have any of that sort of smarts or eloquence or ideas that were beyond my knowledge. I feel like Arianna is such a much more global citizen than I was at that age. Here we are in New York and I remember the first time I came to New York. I just didn’t know what to do with the city or how to be in this city. You’re so well traveled. And I just remember looking at a bowl of berries, which didn’t even exist in London, and thinking, “America!”</p>



<p><strong>Ariana, what does it mean to you to hear these two talk about you like that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AG:</strong> It’s amazing. It’s so validating, especially from women like these two, and they’re so talented and they’re so intelligent, and I just love being in their presence and being able to work with them. I kind of just soaked up everything and more. It’s incredible. I feel like I never know what I’m saying or doing at all. So from an outsider’s perspective, knowing that I could be on the right path or that I’m doing something correct is really, really nice. I tend to be an overthinker, so it’s nice to be validated by people I would dream to be validated by. </p>



<p><strong><em>Now You See Me </em></strong><strong>is all about illusion, nothing is as it seems. You could say the same about Hollywood. Was there something in this industry that maybe isn’t as it appears from the outside looking in that surprised you to find out once you were in it? </strong></p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> Yeah, men take way longer in makeup than women! </p>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> And then they act like they’re really alpha, but they’ve got mascara on. It’s like, honey, I would listen to your opinion, but you have a foundation line that ends at your chin. </p>



<p><strong>AG</strong>:<em> [laughs] </em>Absolutely! They need their snacks and their massages. And it’s like we’re wearing a corset. For me, obviously, [you’re shooting] for months, so there’s the time of the month when you’re a woman and you have heels on and a corset and you just have to live life like that’s normal. And I just remember being like<em> Ow, it hurts.</em> And no one understood, except my fellow girls. </p>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> We get it. We get it! I feel like the biggest surprise for me was the red carpet piece being so corporate. I always thought it was a moment to express yourself and just wear something that you like, but it’s a lot. It’s a business. It’s more of a business than maybe it appears from the outside.</p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>For me, what was shocking was how many like stories that I’ve heard about how people mistreat other people, like they think that they are better than everyone else that’s making them who they are. I’ve been getting my hair and makeup done and I hear stories. It’s not in my nature to even think that that’s acceptable or okay. But the people that seem super gracious, unfortunately they mistreat people.</p>



<p><strong>IF: </strong>Are you looking at me? [<em>laughs</em>] Where’s my coffee! </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11942507.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=618&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A309"" /><figcaption>Woody Harrelson as Merrit McKinney, Jesse Eisenberg as Daniel Atlas, Dominic Sessa as Bosco, Dave Franco as Jack Wilder, Justice Smith as Charlie, Isla Fisher as Henley Reeves, and Ariana Greenblatt as June in Now You See Me, Now You Don’t.

<p><strong>OK, we’re going to end on some rapid fire questions. Who’s most likely to pull off a heist?</strong></p>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> Rosamund, obviously!</p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> Ariana.</p>



<p><strong>AG:</strong> <em>[laughs]</em> The duo! </p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> I’ll tell you how to do it and she’ll execute. </p>



<p><strong>Which one of you is driving the getaway car?</strong></p>



<p><strong>RP: </strong>Isla’s driving the getaway car.</p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>Isla, you’ve got the car. </p>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> Correct.<strong> </strong>I’m very good with a minivan. I know, it’s sexy. </p>



<p><strong>If you could have any magic ability, which one would you pick?</strong></p>



<p><strong>IF: </strong>Getting my kids to eat vegetables! </p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> Oh god, invisibility.</p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>Yes! </p>



<p><strong>Which pop star would make the best magician? </strong></p>



<p><strong>IF: </strong>Dua Lipa because she sings that song “Levitating.”</p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> Eminem.</p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>I was gonna say Charlie XCX. Or Billie [Eilish], because she’s a siren so she’ll lure your brain like Merritt [McKinney, played by Woody Harrelson]. She’ll do some mentalism. </p>



<p><strong>RP: </strong>That’s four horsemen right there. </p>



<p><strong>That’s a good lineup. The Louvre heist was pulled off in seven minutes. What could you pull off in seven  minutes? </strong></p>



<p><strong>RP: </strong>I couldn’t even get out of bed in seven minutes.</p>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> You know what’s weird about this? I do a seven- minute workout. There’s this thing that you can Google, and it’s called a seven-minute workout. </p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> I told you you have the legs of a teenager. </p>



<p><strong>AG:</strong> Nothing’s getting done in seven minutes. </p>



<p><strong>Which star sign would make the best horsemen illusionist?</strong></p>



<p><strong>IF: </strong>Scorpio! Cunning, manipulative. </p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>Gemini, because don’t you have to be like two different people?</p>



<p><strong>RP: </strong>Yeah, Gemini. </p>



<p><strong>What’s something that you would rant about for 29 seconds? What’s the thing you want to go off on?</strong></p>



<p><strong>RP: </strong>Okay, I’m ranting about those little foil things that you get at the end of a tube of toothpaste when you really need to brush your teeth and you need to be really fast, and then you get the cap off, and there’s one of those funny foil things, and you’ve got to get your nail under it. Those things really piss me off. </p>



<p><strong>IF: </strong>I’m going to go with parent chat groups. I’m on one right now that’s done my head in. If somebody just writes, “Thanks,” your phone just vibrates for hours and hours. You don’t need to thank anyone. Just stop texting. And then when you ask something real, like, <em>“What day is book week?”</em> and <em>“Is it like pajama day?”</em> it’s silence, crickets. You can’t get anyone on there. </p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> And we should never say thanks to an AI either. It’s apparently using up loads and loads of energy just to say thanks to people. </p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>Or using it in general. </p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> Being polite costs masses and masses of wattage. </p>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> I thought if you weren’t polite, then when [AI] comes to take over us, they’ll just pick all the rude ones first.</p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong><em> [laughs]</em></p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>I want to rant about mean people on the internet and in real life. You’re not better than anybody. Seriously, like, learn some manners. I can’t stand it. </p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> This is what we’re talking about. I’m talking about the silver foil at the end of a toothpaste and she’s talking about something global and relevant. I’m utterly selfish. </p>



<p><strong>IF: </strong>You’ve just highlighted the generational difference<em> [laughs].</em></p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>There’s so much hatred. It’s so useless, it’s so annoying. It’s so much easier to just be chill. </p>



<p><strong>IF: </strong>Take the silver thing off the toothpaste! </p>



<p><strong>AG:</strong> And don’t say thank you to AI! And AI actresses don’t exist! </p>
