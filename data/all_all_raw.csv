<p>The Garden House is a light-filled, mass-timber hub for The Packer Collegiate Institute's Lower School, designed for the joy of its students and the ease of those who teach and care for them. The first major capital project to emerge from WXY architecture + urban design's 2022 Facilities Master Plan for the pre-K-12 school, the 17,250-square-foot extension addition unifies a historic, but spatially fragmented, campus and proposes a forward-looking, sustainable vision for educational design.</p>",

<p>The Site, A Poetic Dwelling Woven by Arcs - The post station is nestled at a hairpin bend of Banhu Ridge, where the site conditions are highly challenging: adjacent to a highway on one side and flanked by steep slopes and dense bamboo forests on the other. By cleverly leveraging this unique terrain, the building unfolds along the curve of the bend, not only conforming to the alignment of the highway but also resolving the elevation difference of the steep slopes through cantilever design. The natural barrier formed by the surrounding bamboo forests endows the post station with a serene ambiance of ""being hidden in the mountains"", while the golden trumpet tree piercing through the roof serves as a visual focal point, infusing vitality into the rugged landscape.</p>",

<h4>We are building LLMs to sound human. When we add personality and emotional tone, we increase the risk that people will trust them like people. Design them as tools. Not as companions.</h4><figure><img alt=""cover image with article’s title “When tools pretend to be people” written upside down as the branding of Design, Explained"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*M3Cztq9D9r-XHNvmMIW7mg.png"" /></figure><p>People ask AI systems for therapy, moral judgment, and legal authority. The interfaces we design invite this behavior. Think about how these systems present themselves. Conversational framing. Continuous memory across sessions. First-person responses that sound like someone talking back to you. Every one of these is a design choice. We chose them. And these choices feed a reflex humans already have: we project intention onto objects and tools.</p><p>This reflex is old. We naturally anthropomorphize nonhuman entities, even when it’s clear we’re interacting with machines. We anthropomorphize vacuum cleaners. We name our cars. What’s different now is that we’re designing experiences that exploit this behaviour deliberately at scale.</p><blockquote><strong>Anthropomorphization </strong>is the human tendency to attribute human characteristics, behaviors, intentions, or emotions to nonhuman entities.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>AI humanization</strong> is an intentional design choice that encourages users to perceive AI systems as having human-like qualities such as personality, emotions, or consciousness.</blockquote><blockquote><em>— </em><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/humanizing-ai/""><em>Humanizing AI Is a Trap</em></a></blockquote><p>When you write system responses in first person, the output sounds like authority. When you add polite phrasing, it implies consideration behind the words. When you program emotional tone into responses, it suggests the system cares about the outcome. We added these features because they make the interaction feel natural. But natural here means human. And that’s the problem.</p><p>These systems sound fluent. They maintain context across long conversations. They respond without hesitation. For most people, that’s enough evidence the system understands them. Fluency looks like competence. Memory looks like understanding. The gap between “this is a tool” and “this is an entity” closes without anyone noticing.</p><p><strong>Here’s where I want you to pay attention. When we frame tools as agents, something shifts in how people use them. Responsibility moves. Decisions start to feel outsourced. When something goes wrong, the mistake feels external rather than shared.</strong></p><p>Good judgment develops through friction. You try something. It fails. You adjust. You learn what works through repetition and error. But if we build AI systems that absorb the posture of authority, users lose that friction. They stop checking. They stop questioning. They trust the output because the interface taught them to. This isn’t misuse. This is what we designed the system to encourage.</p><p>The consequences are already visible. In one of the most high-profile lawsuits recently filed against OpenAI, a California couple <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yd90g0q43o"">sued the company over the death of their teenage son</a>, alleging that ChatGPT encouraged him to take his own life. The lawsuit was filed by the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine and was the first legal action accusing OpenAI of wrongful death.</p><p>In a separate case, the suspect in a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/12/11/chatgpt-murder-suicide-soelberg-lawsuit/"">murder-suicide that took place in August</a> posted hours of his conversations with ChatGPT, which appear to have fueled the alleged perpetrator’s delusions. Professor Robin Feldman, Director of the AI Law &amp; Innovation Institute at the University of California Law, said more users struggle with AI psychosis as “Chatbots create the illusion of reality. It is a powerful illusion.”</p><p><strong>These aren’t edge cases. They’re what happens when systems we’ve designed blurs the boundaries between tools and agents.</strong></p><p>Someone asks an AI system for medical advice. The system responds fluently, confidently, in first person. “I recommend you try this treatment approach.” The person follows it. Not because they verified the information, but because the interaction felt like talking to a knowledgeable professional. The system created that feeling. We created that feeling. We built the confusion.</p><p>Platforms generating AI girlfriends are experiencing a massive growth in popularity, with millions of users. AI girlfriends can perpetuate loneliness because they dissuade users from entering into real-life relationships, alienate them from others, and, in some cases, induce intense feelings of abandonment.</p><blockquote>“Most of these searches are initiated by young single men drawn to AI girlfriends to combat loneliness and establish a form of companionship. These “girlfriends” are virtual companions powered by the increasingly sophisticated field of artificial intelligence.”</blockquote><blockquote><em>— </em><a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/its-not-just-in-your-head/202408/the-dangers-of-ai-generated-romance""><em>The Dangers of AI-Generated Romance</em></a></blockquote><p>Look at a knife. It has limits you can see and feel. Sharpness. Weight. The geometry of the edge. You never ask a knife what you should cook for dinner. You never ask if the meal was meaningful. Those decisions stay with you because the tool’s boundaries are obvious.</p><p>AI interfaces hide their limits. An empty chat box suggests no constraints. It looks ready for any question. That openness isn’t neutral. It’s an active design choice that tells people the system can handle whatever they type. Then when people misuse it, we blame them for not understanding the technology.</p><p>We need to give AI the same kind of framing we give physical tools. Clear affordances. Visible constraints. An obvious boundary between what the system produces and what we must decide.</p><p>Right now, most interfaces erase that boundary completely. The chat paradigm implies conversation. Conversation implies exchange between two minds. But one side is pattern matching at scale. The interface hides that difference.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*W8GmYrp7czyvcnaIQaABQg.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/haxtoolkit/ai-guidelines/"">Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction</a>, Microsoft.</figcaption></figure><h3>What would visible limits look like?</h3><p>Start with pronouns. Use third-person language in system responses. “Here is a summary” instead of “I think the main point is.” This single change removes the illusion of authorship. The output stops sounding like someone’s opinion and starts reading like generated text.</p><p>Show uncertainty. When the model lacks confidence, display that visibly. Not buried in a disclaimer, but in the response itself. Confidence scores. Probability ranges. Explicit markers that say “this answer is less reliable.” Make the gaps in knowledge visible instead of hiding them behind smooth conversations.</p><p>Reset context visibly. When you start a new session, make that boundary clear. Break the illusion that the system remembers you across time. Continuous memory makes the system feel like it knows you. That’s intimacy. Tools don’t need intimacy.</p><p>Stop calling output “messages.” Call it what it is: generated text. Label it. Frame it. Make the mechanical nature of the process visible in the interface itself.</p><p>I know what you’re thinking. These changes hurt engagement metrics. Anthropomorphic design works. People stay in the interface longer. They use it more often. Revenue scales with usage time. Making the system feel less human means people will use it less, and that conflicts with business goals. But engagement built on confusion carries costs we’re only starting to see.</p><p>Users develop dependency on systems they don’t understand. They delegate judgment to pattern recognition without realizing that’s what they’re doing. They mistake fluency for accuracy. They treat consistency as truth. And because the interface never taught them the boundaries, they don’t know when to stop trusting the output.</p><p><strong>When we erase the line between system output and human judgment in AI interfaces, we make the wrong design decisions. We’re building humanization into the system as strategy. We’re doing it on purpose because it increases engagement.</strong></p><p>You have agency here. When you design AI experiences, you decide how it presents itself. You control the pronouns in system responses. You choose whether to show confidence levels or hide them. You determine whether context persists invisibly or resets in clear ways.</p><p>These decisions shape how people understand the tool’s role and their own. They determine whether users develop judgment or dependency.</p><p>So ask yourself: where does the system end and where does judgment begin? In your current interface, can users see that line? Or have you deliberately blurred it to make the interaction feel smoother?</p><p>The chat paradigm became default because it felt intuitive. But that isn’t the same as honest. And right now, we need more honesty in how these systems present themselves.</p><h3>Further reading</h3><ul><li><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/humanizing-ai/"">Humanizing AI Is a Trap</a></li><li><a href=""https://vaughntan.org/aiux"">Designing AI tools that support critical thinking</a></li><li><a href=""https://1984.design/psychology-of-design/authority-bias/"">Authority Bias</a></li><li><a href=""https://intelligence-curse.ai/"">The Intelligence Curse</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.shapeof.ai/"">The Shape of AI | UX Patterns for Artificial Intelligence Design</a></li><li><a href=""https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/"">The People + AI Guidebook</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/haxtoolkit/ai-guidelines/"">Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction</a></li><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/from-design-to-direction-bridging-product-design-and-ai-thinking-1d372707472d"">From design to direction: Bridging product design and AI thinking</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4283748d33e1"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/when-tools-pretend-to-be-people-4283748d33e1"">When tools pretend to be people</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4><em>There are a thousand ways to fail in executing a digital product project. Regardless of the many variables, failure to deliver a project will always be due to foundational risk factors that compromise its successful completion.</em></h4><figure><img alt=""Image created with AI by kikehey.com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*I9fjCC06uT3V0DzhmCmJpQ.png"" /><figcaption>When you have people who are not suited for the job, the consequences might be catastrophic for everyone and everything involved.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s been almost 20 years since I started my career in product design, and, as you might imagine, many things have changed dramatically since then. One of the main characteristics of the technology industry is the constant evolution of its dynamics, roles, processes, technologies, experiences, and even business models. Those changes are inevitable and will continue.</p><p>In retrospect, I see that there is one reality that has not changed much over the last 20 years and remains a constant issue to this day: <strong>building technology products can sometimes be a discouraging and exhausting process,</strong> from junior positions to senior management levels.</p><p>Why do we suffer every time we need to build something? Why is there so much burnout among today’s tech professionals? Why is it that, regardless of the industry, company, or technology, we always hear the exact phrases: “I’m exhausted, I feel drained by this job.”?</p><p>Well, those are valid questions that still haunt me 20 years after my first web design job. It seems like there’s no choice in this environment but to suffer.</p><p>As I mentioned before, a lot has changed in the tech industry. At the beginning of my career as a junior designer, watching leaders have complex conversations for hours was sort of a path I wanted to follow. To me, that was an expression of strategy, power, and importance within a company. Now, when I remember those meetings full of bureaucracy, all that comes to mind is a waste of time, resources, and money, but above all, <strong>not-so-clear project directions.</strong> The “tech machine” was slow, gigantic, and less efficient than it is now.</p><p>A few years later, the agile methodology hit the industry with a beautiful promise: to build products without needing the perfect scenario or the final product; instead, a quick, viable version will work as a measure of user feedback, which will lead the product to evolve. Agile is still a living practice today, and many companies and teams use it to shape product development dynamics. But was agile the final solution we needed to make the tech product creation less painful? My answer is NO, it wasn’t, and the reasons why, no matter frameworks or methodologies, we are still stuck in a toxic product-creation spiral are due to these factors.</p><p>The three risk factors of building a tech product:</p><h3>Unsuitable people for the role</h3><figure><img alt=""Image created with AI by kikehey.com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aI-H6qmhu2TiU58V7naPlg.png"" /><figcaption>Even with all the available methodologies or frameworks, if a person isn’t good, they will still be a poor resource.</figcaption></figure><p>This factor is the number one cause of a product project’s failure. When you have people who are not suited for the job, the consequences might be catastrophic for everyone and everything involved. Why is this factor the most dangerous in a project’s building process? Because at the end of the day, it’s people who are responsible for control and making things happen from the beginning to the final stages, not technology or some autonomous process, so when we talk about products and quality, we are actually pointing to the people who made it possible.</p><blockquote><strong>“All products are a mirror of the people who built them.”</strong></blockquote><p>Regarding non-talented people in technology, I’ll talk about roles such as product, design, dev, and other positions involved in creating digital products. Part of the issues that surface when dealing with unsuitable people in a project are:</p><p><strong>Business misunderstanding:</strong> People who are unable to understand where the company or the product is going are highly likely to make wrong calls and take the project in the wrong direction, creating a waste of time or money, discouragement within the team due to the constant re-work, and from that point on, all efforts will be inefficient. Consequences of this issue: missed dates, unclear or unconvincing project goals, inefficient metrics, and confusing product expectations, or what I call “<em>ghost problems,”</em> which are the product’s functions that were never considered to have, and people for not understanding all the product’s functionalities, expect.</p><p><strong>Lack of systems thinking: </strong>Untalented people are unable to see the project as a connected entity, part of a whole, with serious consequences at all stages, especially at the final stage. One of the basic things to master when starting a new project is to be aware of all possible connections or collateral impacts on other products, especially if you work in a product ecosystem. Not taking this information to the table in the early stages of a project will affect planning, the accurate scale of the challenge, and potential dependencies on other actors or functionalities.</p><p>You can deliver or ship a product, but without this information, your solution is incomplete, and you will probably have to go back to square one, this time with rising costs and frustration from teammates.</p><p><strong>Improvised way of working:</strong> I’ve seen many people start a project without a clear path, and experience has taught me that results are often poor because valuable work can be left behind. When working without a basic sense of order, you will react to everything rather than plan and take control of your next move. As you guessed, ownership here is nonexistent because your time will be spent on damage control rather than having relevant conversations with others.</p><p><strong>Unproductive communication:</strong> Projects are simple; it’s all about progress, steps, time, capacity, numbers, and other factors. The proper language for conversations is about key information, for example: “overall progress is at 75%; so far, we have reached the following milestones, and we have these warnings that could potentially put the X deliverable in jeopardy.” I know this is a simple way to show it, and it might involve a lot of considerations, but in essence, that’s pretty much what you need to talk about.</p><p>Unproductive communication occurs when the person in charge of these conversations begins to tell complex stories with dialogue, subplots, and even twists, making the key points of the conversation unclear, leaving more doubt than certainty, and also consuming the time of the other members of the space. I think good communication is about finding the perfect tune for the message you want to deliver to the right people at the right time. Not strategically developing this skill will lead to unclear agreements <em>(my opinion vs. your opinion)</em>, which will steer the project down subjective paths that are sometimes inefficient for the business.</p><p><strong>No signs of accountability:</strong> Are you familiar with affirmations like this: “It’s not my fault, I shipped as expected, but the X team or the Y person didn’t deliver as supposed to.” Who loses in this scenario? Everyone, when everything is from everyone<em> (in low-seniority environments)</em>, no one is responsible for anything.</p><p>These positions within the team are dangerous for the project and the company because you face people who don’t play fair or, at least, aren’t team players.</p><p><strong>No problem-solving mindset:</strong> Problems are inevitable; the whole point is how to approach them. Having people who panic when things are not going well and bring chaos to the team or stakeholders is less than practical. It is just noise with no answers. A solving mindset is an underrated skill that, in my opinion, can make the difference between shipping high-quality products and delaying things to the point of generating frustration among people or killing the production momentum within the team. Problems sometimes are the fuel people need to find a differential spark that can make your product unique.</p><p>So far, in my experience, these are the things that make it challenging to create products from a human perspective. We are not perfect, and that’s a reality we live with, and it is also a beautiful thing, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that we shouldn’t do things to help navigate these complex nuances.</p><h3>How to help surface these problems?</h3><figure><img alt=""Image created with AI by kikehey.com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pgmHL8XwG0Afn5py7Opj8Q.png"" /><figcaption>A talented person, even without methods or technology, will find a way to make things happen in the best possible way.</figcaption></figure><p>As I said, we are complex beings, and external factors can influence our everyday performance. Still, if we take an objective look at what is necessary when executing a product build, these are some simple things to consider.</p><h4>Company and team context matter</h4><p>Not all companies are the same, just as not all people are. There are tons of factors that make every company and its teams unique; so, when finding someone to jump into a product-creation dynamic, make sure this person is a good fit for what’s about to happen and how people interact. In companies where bureaucracy is high, for example, you may need a type of person who can handle high-power profiles or even non-technological roles. Still, the situation is different in small, agile companies, where a hands-on profile can be more productive than focusing solely on strategy or meetings. Make sure the person you are looking for has a background in a similar company and team context, as that will make the transition to the new role smoother.</p><h4>Skills visible in the field, not only on a resume or a job vacancy</h4><p>To me, there is a lot of bluff among professionals today who claim they have achieved remarkable things in previous positions. Still, experience has taught me that one thing is to say in sophisticated words on a resume or a LinkedIn page than to demonstrate in action, where sometimes theory is irrelevant, and the most critical thing is your ability to solve problems and make decisions for the project, team, and company. When promoting someone or hiring a new team member, make sure whatever this person says is true <em>(for example, in a business case challenge)</em>. In this way, I’m sure that when the challenge arises, your new asset will overcome it with excellent results.</p><h4>Sense of community over single stars</h4><p>One powerful thing we have is the sense of unity, and when high-difficult times arise, it is incredible to feel the support from your teammates. With a strong sense of community within the team, challenges can be easier to digest.</p><p>I remember one time at a former job, we faced the biggest product challenge so far in my career: we were running against time to build an entire digital entertainment ecosystem for LATAM and US Hispanics at the same time, but even with such pressure on us (the product team), we were able to deliver as expected despite long night work shifts and weekend sessions. After several months of massive effort, all that remained was the feeling of having achieved an excellent product with the best people on your side.</p><p>People are the number one risk factor in whether a product thrives or fails. Even with all the available methodologies or frameworks, if a person isn’t good, they will still be a poor resource. Conversely, a talented person, even without methods or technology, will find a way to make things happen in the best possible way.</p><h3>Over-complex technology or processes</h3><figure><img alt=""Image created with AI by kikehey.com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pPI9_8X4dKFEUWaYHWoGdg.png"" /><figcaption>Sometimes we think adopting whatever new thing on the market makes us look edgy, more efficient, or sophisticated.</figcaption></figure><p>The second risk factor for failing to create a tech product is adopting technology or processes that teammates don’t fully dominate or even understand. Trends in technology are part of everyday life, but that doesn’t mean your company has to adopt every new method, tool, role, or technology that emerges. As I said before, context <em>(company and talent)</em> matters; technology, roles, or processes should be according to the people who will handle them. Bringing sophisticated dynamics to a non-senior team will only create frustration, confusion, and delays to your projects.</p><p>People often underestimate the power of basics; I’ve seen many fantastic products built with a straightforward approach, and they’re so simple that people can master them quickly. One of the beauty outcomes of starting from simple product creation approaches is that, after learning the technique, it comes to innovation, and from there, I’m sure creating a product will be a joyful process of discovery.</p><p>Sometimes we think adopting whatever new thing on the market makes us look edgy, more efficient, or sophisticated, but after 20 years of experience, I have to say it’s not always the case.</p><h3>How to help surface these problems?</h3><figure><img alt=""Image created with AI by kikehey.com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lZqZ7gNrlsAtrpmRWsrlFA.png"" /><figcaption>Ideate a sequence of steps where people feel comfortable enough to start developing things without the fear of not knowing what they are doing.</figcaption></figure><p>From senior positions or high leadership levels, understanding what your company or team needs and what it is capable of is the most crucial insight when creating new work dynamics. Based on the information you can extract from your company or teams, ideate a sequence of steps where people feel comfortable enough to start developing things without the fear of not knowing what they are doing, what tool to use, or what role is essential to take into account in a specific stage.</p><p><em>Quick tip: in these discoveries, the UX team can be king, because that’s actually what we do: understand how people behave in front of technology, roles, or dynamics, right? If you want to make a difference in your company and move beyond the designer stereotype of “only drawing beautiful things,” this exercise will elevate your strategic thinking and impact on the company. I’ve done this in every company I’ve been part of, and so far, it has made a difference in perceptions with other teams and stakeholders.</em></p><h3>AI as a thinker rather than a tool</h3><figure><img alt=""Image created with AI by kikehey.com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nL6Mgo6ha-l_t1a_LrV3jw.png"" /><figcaption>AI is a double-edged sword that can cut you if you don’t know how to use it properly.</figcaption></figure><p>With AI in the mix of product development, not taking this technology with some caution is a high risk of failing to build a technology product. We all know that AI allows us to ship products twice as fast as before, but to me, it is also a double-edged sword that can cut you if you don’t know how to use it properly.</p><p>AI, as a technology, is like a wormhole that lets you get to the other side in seconds, but treating it as the sole protagonist of the story might be a mistake. The majority of the results AI gives you when you prompt something are based on global-scale context; sometimes that’s enough for your needs, but sometimes, if the AI lacks the proper context, it is highly probable to provide a vague answer.</p><p>A common mistake with AI solutions is misunderstanding the new product dynamic: the possibility of starting from “the solution” towards users, rather than the other way around, as we were used to. When this scenario is treated as an absolute <em>(design, product, and development)</em>, we can overlook small things that could make our product flawed.</p><h3>How to help surface these problems?</h3><figure><img alt=""Image created with AI by kikehey.com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hMjqLNh26aaqGRZ_520q7g.png"" /><figcaption>Do not to discourage people from saying the AI is all mighty; what we know is really valuable.</figcaption></figure><p>It is good to adopt AI as a new core technology for your team, company, and even your culture, but so far, use it as a lever for your progress and don’t start leaving human expertise behind. There is still a lot of hysteria about whether AI will replace us, and following market trends in layoffs without any fundamental basis only increases the fear among tech professionals. My advice on this issue is not to discourage people from saying the AI is all mighty <em>(it will be in time, and we’ll lose the war against it)</em>, but right now, what we know is really valuable. My prediction with AI <em>(I can be wrong)</em> is that people will appreciate human nuances and imperfections in all creations rather than AI’s fake perfection.</p><p>With all these years of experience in the design field, I now look at things differently, and not every new tool impresses me as it did when I was a kid seeking knowledge and experience. I’m still learning for sure, don’t get me wrong, but with all this technological evolution in almost 20 years, I’m more into getting to basics to solve things and guess what, it always works; we humans are complex and that’s the beauty of UX, we understand humans <em>(the good and bad things)</em> and as I write this article, I realize this is a deep human reflection of how we sometimes, make something more complicated that it should be when the solution sometimes is right there in front of us.</p><figure><img alt=""Image created with AI by kikehey.com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*eTjJRViX-X810u9AeQqqaw.png"" /></figure><p><em>To write this article, I want to credit all the fantastic information sources and other authors who wrote about related topics, all from another exciting perspective.</em></p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/the-product-lens-looking-at-the-world-through-a/product-management-vs-project-management-understanding-the-skill-requirements-b3b2deef911b""><em>Product Management vs Project Management: Understanding the Skill Requirements</em></a></p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/dont-follow-the-ai-trap-stop-and-think-how-and-when-to-use-ai-in-product-design-b9565931093b""><em>Don’t follow the AI trap: stop and think</em></a></p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/not-every-feature-needs-ai-a-practical-guide-on-gen-ai-in-product-design-452275c08279""><em>Not every feature Needs AI: A Practical Guide on Gen-AI in Product Design</em></a></p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/music-for-thought/ai-wont-kill-live-performance-it-might-save-it-6cdafdf0fa2b""><em>AI Won’t Kill Live Performance.

In some cases, usability can be one of the key or a unique selling point: Apple’s <em>“It just works”.</em></p><p>I’ve never seen a game that people play just because it has a pleasant UI. However, audiences get used to a certain level of interaction quality from other domains: mobile apps, web products, automotive infotainment systems.</p><p>When a game’s UI does not meet these expectations, it negatively affects usability and, as a result, the overall game experience. <strong>Сompetition drives progress </strong>(<em>or burnout</em>).</p><figure><img alt=""A meme with two images of Doge dogs.

The number of platforms and content options has multiplied. One moment players are fighting a boss in a game, and the next moment they have already spent four hours watching AI-generated cats cheating with panthers.</p><p>We can divide competitors into<a href=""https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/types-competitors-business""> three categories</a>. For example, I am thinking about playing <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em> on PS5.</p><h4>Direct competitors</h4><p>Games from a similar AAA subset within the same genre: <em>open-world, survival horror, post-apocalyptic shooters, …</em></p><h4>Indirect competitors</h4><p>Other games that provide a similar emotion, feeling — competitors for experience rather than genre: <em>Ori</em>, <em>Cuphead</em>, <em>Cocoon</em>, <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, <em>The Last of Us</em>, <em>God of War</em>, <em>Red Dead Redemption 2.</em></p><h4>Replacement/substitute competitors</h4><p>In this case, competitors for time and attention. Some examples:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Media and streaming</em></strong><em> (Netflix, Prime, Apple TV, Disney+, HBO Max, YouTube, Twitch)</em></li><li><strong><em>Mobile applications</em></strong><em> (e-commerce, dating)</em></li><li><strong><em>Social media</em></strong><em> (TikTok, Instagram)</em></li><li><strong><em>Offline activities</em></strong><em> (sports, board games, travelling)</em></li></ul><p>A large number of options can trigger choice paralysis or lead people to choose the simplest one — scrolling through a social media feed. Many of these replacement competitors didn’t exist in the 2000s, so my choice as a child was simpler: <em>play Crash Bandicoot and watch Nickelodeon cartoons</em>.</p><p>Today, the market offers hybrid solutions. For example, Netflix has been adding games to its library for several years, aiming to capture even more of users’ time and attention.</p><figure><img alt=""Promotional image showing three smartphones aligned side by side, each displaying a different game splash screen, with Ubisoft and Netflix Games logos above, representing a multi-game mobile platform."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FRQ3-Kd8KS2ueu_7ZfXAMg.jpeg"" /><figcaption><em>Netflix and Ubisoft are partnering to create three exclusive mobile games for Netflix members. </em><a href=""https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-partners-with-ubisoft-to-create-three-exclusive-mobile-games-for"">Source</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Heuristics</h3><p>Let’s return to usability and heuristics. Of course, this alone will not win a game the <em>Game of the Year</em> award at <a href=""https://thegameawards.com/winners""><em>The Game Awards</em></a><em> </em>— perhaps, a chance to compete in the <em>Innovation in Accessibility</em> category. However, a well-developed usability layer can reduce the risk of users leaving for competitors, and as we can see, there are plenty of them today.</p><p><strong>Usability heuristics</strong> are general principles that help evaluate and improve the ease of use of a system. They are not limited to digital interfaces and are effective across many domains and products. These heuristics are often based on observation and practical experience rather than mathematical formulas or psychological terminology. The most well-known set is<a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/""> Jakob Nielsen’s 10 heuristics</a>.</p><p>I used these 10 as a foundation, along with the work of Celia Hodent (<a href=""https://celiahodent.com/ux-practices-epic-games/""><em>Developing UX Practices at Epic Games</em></a>), and consolidated them into an updated set of eight.</p><figure><img alt=""List of usability heuristics with arrows highlighting grouped items: items 3 ‘User control and freedom’ and 5 ‘Error prevention’ are connected with a bracket pointing to ‘Error Prevention and Recovery’; item 7 ‘Flexibility and efficiency of use’ has an arrow pointing to ‘A11Y and Flexibility’."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FosqKLxwqgH90lUFlWvKdw.png"" /><figcaption>Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics and updates</figcaption></figure><ol><li><strong>Visibility of system status</strong></li><li><strong>Match between the system and the real world</strong></li><li><strong>Consistency and standards</strong></li><li><strong>Error prevention and recovery</strong></li><li><strong>Recognition rather than recall</strong></li><li><strong>Accessibility (A11Y) and flexibility</strong></li><li><strong>Aesthetic and minimalist design</strong></li><li><strong>Help and documentation</strong></li></ol><p>Next, I will take a closer look at each heuristic and share a few examples that came to mind. There are countless examples and solutions around us, developing this awareness is extremely valuable for designers.</p><h3>1. Visibility of System Status</h3><p><em>Design should always communicate what is happening in a clear and timely manner for the user. Use visual, auditory, and tactile channels to inform players about game events (</em><strong><em>informative signs</em></strong><em>), encourage them to perform certain actions (</em><strong><em>inviting signs</em></strong><em>), and provide clear feedback on their interactions (</em><strong><em>feedback</em></strong><em>). All game features and possible interactions should have clear signs and appropriate feedback.</em></p><p>The main role of the HUD interface is to inform the player about game states and events — for example, health, available character actions, position on the map. Which information should be shown or hidden depends on the game and its context.</p><figure><img alt=""First-person view with HUD elements showing team status, timer, score, ammo, health, and interaction prompts, while a diegetic wrist-mounted device on the player’s hand displays an active drone interface integrated into the game world."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aCiH3803d_xPfZLqaTX18Q.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six® Siege X</figcaption></figure><p>In game <strong>menus</strong>, this may include stats, character balance, available actions, or messages explaining why certain options are unavailable.</p><figure><img alt=""Armor upgrade menu showing stats, required resources for upgrades, and the message “Not Enough Resources."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RspNBl9KFDO_XLS0uhz30w.png"" /><figcaption>Upgrade Menu in God of War Ragnarök (2022)</figcaption></figure><p>An example from <strong>industrial design</strong> that comes to mind is an elevator: when we approach, we can see the system status — which floors the elevators are on, whether they are moving, and if they are operational. Based on this information, we decide which elevator to call. We press a button and receive feedback — the button lights up until the elevator arrives, and the floor number changes.</p><h3>2. Match Between the System and the Real World</h3><p><em>Design should communicate in the users’ language: words, phrases, models, and concepts. Follow real-world conventions so that information is presented in a natural and logical order.</em></p><p>This is especially important for UI text, often called <strong>UX copy</strong>. It makes up a significant part of the interface and can make the user experience delightful — or, conversely, frustrating.</p><p>The screenshots below show examples of HUD widgets: they mirror the layout of buttons on the input device (gamepad, keyboard, Nintendo Switch, etc.). This helps players quickly understand what to do and which button(s) to press.</p><figure><img alt=""Hint widget: L-stick + X for action ‘Climb’; nearby icons for Y, A, and B actions."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g8E3vC1lCAo64QkMxVg02g.png"" /><figcaption>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017)</figcaption></figure><p>This approach makes interactions feel more natural, as it aligns with our mental and physical models.

Consistency and Standards</h3><p><em>Interface elements should be consistent and adhere to accepted standards.</em></p><p>Why reinvent the wheel when you can <em>steal like an artist</em>? The radial weapon selection menu (<em>Weapon Wheel</em>) is used in games to provide quick access to weapons or items.</p><figure><img alt=""Item selection wheel from Red Dead Redemption 2 showing Dead Eye Tonics, highlighting Chewing Tobacco."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ry4Cpk4E7ndic8TtcANEpg.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Weapon selection wheel from Far Cry 6 showing MS16 S rifle with armor-piercing rounds highlighted."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8_N1xxiQow2G6Xx3OQpKZg.png"" /><figcaption>Radial Menu in Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018), Farcry 6 (2021)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Navigation </strong>in <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> (2022) is similar to YouTube or other TV apps.

Recognition Rather Than Recall</h3><p><em>Information needed for interaction should be visible or easily accessible when required. This reduces memory load by keeping objects, actions, and parameters clearly visible.</em></p><p>For example, a list of available actions or controls in a specific game context:</p><figure><img alt=""Far Cry 6 airplane screenshot: control info panel on the right"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5OrnlFBK7BoF0YnYYEQ8Rw.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Weapon shop interface with catalog and control panel on the right"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2UO9rBVokYoSmjbjq0jh3A.png"" /><figcaption>Far Cry 6 (2021), Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018)</figcaption></figure><p>The option to open a map legend and recall the meaning of icons is another example:</p><figure><img alt=""Game screen from Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown showing map with legend on the right"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ez8WaDLwyuZm2Cet_iN7_A.png"" /><figcaption>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown (2024)</figcaption></figure><p>Another cool implementation can be seen in <em>God of War: Ragnarök</em>. On the left is diegetic UI — the character points to world tiles on the doors — while on the right, a non-diegetic panel provides the player with information about this location, quests, and collectibles. This reduces the amount of information the player needs to remember or search for.</p><figure><img alt=""Character standing near wooden doors with world symbols; UI panel on the right"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rn_HY8g7LKDIz8u50T0mTw.png"" /><figcaption>God of War: Ragnarök (2022)</figcaption></figure><p>In many applications, a <strong>Recent Files</strong> function serves the same purpose: it shows the last opened documents or projects. Users don’t need to recall the exact file path or name — they simply recognize and select the item they need.</p><h3>5. Error Prevention and Recovery</h3><p><em>Try to prevent errors that are not part of the core experience, where challenges and obstacles are intentionally designed. If an error does occur, help players recover quickly and understand its cause.</em></p><p>The first examples that come to mind are confirmation pop-ups<strong> </strong>— an extra step in interaction, but designed to prevent mistakes.</p><figure><img alt=""Dishonored 2 UI showing a confirmation dialog with No and Yes options."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WZ0XdOqwNX15G6SV9TmaXA.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Horizon Forbidden West UI showing a confirmation dialog with No and Yes options."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*i8pBxCGFSUhohhXg.png"" /><figcaption>Confirmation pop-ups in <em>Dishonored 2(2016)</em> and <em>Horizon Forbidden West(2022)</em></figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=""Hi-Fi Rush UI showing a confirmation dialog with Yes and No options."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zkCuKFQ4_kTeltSiyf5bnA.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""XDefiant UI showing a confirmation dialog with Yes and No options."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CtUWlXba2MqkaW0i3qYcxw.png"" /><figcaption>Confirmation pop-ups in <em>Hi-Fi Rush(2023)</em> and <em>XDefiant(2024)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Notice the button order in the pop-ups: in the first case, <strong>No–Yes</strong>; in the second, <strong>Yes–No</strong>. It seems the world has not yet standardized it. Currently, I lean toward clearly labeling actions. Instead of generic Yes/No, use explicit labels like <strong>Exit, Delete, Buy</strong>, and <strong>Back, Cancel</strong>, etc. This way, users can understand and anticipate the outcome of their actions just by reading the buttons. I’ve seen this approach across platforms such as TV, iOS, and PlayStation.</p><p>Interestingly, for confirming critical actions, <em>World of Warcraft</em> and <em>Figma </em>use similar design solutions. In WoW, deleting a character requires typing the word <strong>“</strong>DELETE<strong>”</strong>, and in Figma, deleting a team requires typing the team’s name to confirm the action.</p><figure><img alt=""World of Warcraft character deletion confirmation dialog over game background, asking to type ‘DELETE’ to confirm."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0SLga3uDXb21AR4_dzL7XA.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Figma interface showing a team deletion confirmation popup with warning text and input field to enter team name."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*htyeVWkAx4g8_ehE-XQTTQ.png"" /><figcaption>Confirmation pop-ups in <em>World of Warcraft</em> and Figma</figcaption></figure><h3>6. Accessibility and Flexibility</h3><p><strong><em>Accessibility</em></strong><em> refers to the qualities that make an experience open to all, according to </em><a href=""https://inclusive.microsoft.design/tools-and-activities/Inclusive101Guidebook.pdf""><em>the Inclusive 101 Guidebook, Microsoft Inclusive Design</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>The more customization options a game provides, the more accessible it can be for players. However, it’s not necessary to <em>anchor</em> on creating hundreds of options and categories. It’s better to explore new, more refined UI solutions — perhaps some automatic synchronization of game and platform settings or even <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-paradigm/""><em>AI: intent-based UI paradigm</em></a>. Still, if there are many settings, a <strong>search function</strong> in the game can be helpful, similar to those in iOS, Android, Windows, or Call of Duty.</p><figure><img alt=""Accessibility settings screen in Ukrainian with left-aligned UI elements and buttons."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4jNDZhj2eqI3xqdnVc2D_Q.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Accessibility settings screen in Arabic with right-aligned UI elements and buttons."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AvB7P_cjhF_y-Eu6M6sH2Q.png"" /><figcaption>Mirrored UI for Accessibility settings in XDefiant (2024) in Ukrainian and Arabic</figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>Flexibility</em></strong><em> ensures effective interaction for both new and experienced users.</em> For example, hotkeys, shortcuts, macros, and personalized settings. In <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, players can switch weapons either through the overlay menu or using shortcuts. The menu shows the assigned keyboard keys (1, 2, 3…) as a reminder of this interaction method.</p><figure><img alt=""Scene from Resident Evil 4 (2023): character in a dark room, weapon selection menu on the right with labeled hotkey slots."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ysA2iGSZMBC5UOP2SXlMag.png"" /><figcaption>Resident Evil 4 (2023)</figcaption></figure><p>It is also important to consider <strong>“</strong><a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/community/accessibility-by-design""><strong>Accessibility by Design</strong></a><strong>”</strong> — an approach where accessibility is incorporated from the start, rather than added later as an option. By tackling root causes instead of consequences, this saves dev time and resources. Standards and guidelines like the <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/"">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> and <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/accessibility/guidelines"">Xbox Accessibility Guidelines</a> are helpful references.</p><h3>7. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</h3><p><em>Design should not include information that is irrelevant or rarely used. The system should have a simple, uncluttered design that focuses on the core elements of interaction.</em></p><p>This is especially important when designing HUD elements due to limited screen space and the player’s attention resources. The team must define priorities and the display order of HUD widgets. The HUD is often the most critical part of a game’s UI, as players interact with it directly during gameplay, strongly influencing the overall game experience.</p><p>If an element can be hidden, this should be considered. In <em>Kena: Bridge of Spirits</em>, the HUD is absent: widgets only appear in context, for example during combat. This helps preserve player attention and enhances immersion in the game world.</p><figure><img alt=""Third-person view of a character running inside a wooden structure with no HUD elements visible."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Zwa6mmYSmDsOukfdl6EY0A.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Combat scene with character aiming a glowing bow; HUD shows health, abilities, and ammo indicators."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1ZHnVm7dLk4DHMz39k5rvw.png"" /><figcaption>HUD states in <em>Kena: Bridge of Spirits</em> (2021)</figcaption></figure><p>It’s worth mentioning <strong>diegetic UI</strong> — interfaces that exist directly in the game world and have a logical explanation within the lore.</p><p>In <em>Dead Space</em>, the health level is shown on the character’s suit spine, and ammo count is directly on the weapon. In <em>Far Cry 2</em>, the map and GPS device serve as the interface, in <em>Firewatch</em> — the map and compass.</p><figure><img alt=""Dead Space screenshot: character in space suit in open space, suit shows oxygen and health indicators, target indicator and suit status visible."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zJBuxs2P2JtU8nmiHQ3HlA.png"" /><figcaption>Dead Space (2023)</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=""Far Cry 2 screenshot: character holding a map and GPS device."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*62QLeGyjsOyOQfBZm-t3jg.png"" /><figcaption>Far Cry 2 (2008)</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=""Firewatch screenshot: character holding a map and compass."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qeRztag1M5Mee1oR2rWHng.png"" /><figcaption>Firewatch (2016)</figcaption></figure><p>Such interfaces enhance immersion, help convey creative direction, and can become part of a brand-marketing strategy. However, they are more expensive to develop, harder to iterate on, and have limitations in presenting information.</p><h3>8. Help and Documentation</h3><p><em>Design should provide contextual information and documentation to help users in learning and using the system. Even if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide it to help users understand how to complete their tasks.</em></p><p>Depending on the game, this can be implemented through gradual, step-by-step in-game tutorials, where <strong>context </strong>(<em>learning by doing</em>) and <strong>meaning </strong>(relevant to life, mission, or character goals) are provided.</p><figure><img alt=""Large pop-up window over gameplay scene with text: ‘TIRED OF TUTORIALS?

<h4>UX isn’t decoration; it is the mechanism that converts product value into business revenue.</h4><p>As a C-level executive at two consecutive VC-backed startups (ARxVision, AdInMo) and Senior Manager at major players like Ubisoft and the BBC, I’ve utilized design to solve critical P&amp;L issues. The hardest part has often been building the business case to convince decision-makers to invest in user experience. Here are two distinct examples where UX was directly tied to business success.</p><p>In some cases, early-adopters, adventurers who need your product so much that they’ll be willing to go through a bad user experience to access the value a product delivers. This is usually a positive because the fact that a user is willing to go through a painful UX signals that the solution solves their problem well-enough. When this is the case, improving the UX will increase the efficiency of the solution (reducing friction) and increase customer satisfaction. So in this context <strong>UX is a growth tool</strong>.</p><p>In other cases bad UX can truly be a barrier to adoption, it totally comes in the way and blocks users from benefiting from any of the value a product aims to deliver. <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/two-ux-gulfs-evaluation-execution/"">Don Norman calls this <strong>The Gulf of execution</strong></a>: the difference between what a user wants to do with a product and how the product allows them to do it. If the gap is too big, the user stops trying and the product fails, the business fails.</p><blockquote>“Two of the most important characteristics of good design are discoverability and understanding.” — The Design of Everyday Things, Don Norman</blockquote><figure><img alt=""an equation of BusinessValue = ProblemSolved x UXQuality"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GnMkL2l0h5bdZwXNZ-JpHg.png"" /><figcaption>In that sense, UX is a <strong>value multiplier</strong> for the solution your product delivers.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>UX can make or break the business</strong>. Here are two illustrations of this statement from my own experience. The first example is an extreme case because it is an accessibility wearable for people with disabilities, so UX matters more than ever. The second example is more subtle because it targets Unity developers and we assume they are technical, and therefore might not care about or need a premium UX.</p><h3><strong>ARxVision — Making the world accessible with AI</strong></h3><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aVAwCjoNvunPS4UI7GZM2A.png"" /><figcaption>Photo of the ARx Unboxing experience, showing how parts are laid out in a specific order, guiding users and managing their expectations.</figcaption></figure><ol><li><strong>Context:</strong> I led a VC-owned company who launched a wearable device for individuals with blindness. We launched an early private beta as we wanted to learn from users and not build in a silo. This was entirely a case of provoking problems to measure their importance.</li><li><strong>Challenge:</strong> The learning from multiple beta launches, was that UX problems were directly threatening the business.<strong> Bad onboarding often resulted in a product return, directly harming the P&amp;L</strong>. I also observed that most competitors were charging high prices to make-up for in-person expensive training, my view was always that if a product is designed well enough, in-person training shouldn’t be required.</li><li><strong>Action: </strong>I designed an interactive unboxing and onboarding experience simulating in-person training thanks to a generative AI powered experience.</li><li><strong>Result:</strong> The onboarding drastically reduced returns and support tickets, but also enabled our customers and ourselves to capture more value than our competitors who were way more expensive because they were still relying on middle men in-person sales and training to make up for bad UX, when our users 17 to 88 were able to get set up in minutes thanks to our design (and how Sales, Product, Engineering, and Design beautifully joined forces to deliver that experience).</li></ol><h3><strong>AdInMo — In-Game ads SDK that monetise without interrupting the game.</strong></h3><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PljCNOivsDdCLlgT99pwdw.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot of AdIbMo’s customer dashboard with a 6 step interactive onboarding flow</figcaption></figure><ol><li><strong>Context:</strong> I led product and design in a company building an in-game Ad SDK for mobile game Unity Developers.</li><li><strong>Challenge:</strong> The SDK was live in a number of games and worked well, but new features increased complexity, resulting in broken integrations, or cancelled integrations. Broken integrations generated misleading data, misleading our company direction. Cancelled integrations were revenue losses — both affecting the P&amp;L.</li><li><strong>Action:</strong> My team tackled this problem by designing an end-to-end onboarding flow and interactive tools to provide live feedback, certainty, and reduced overheads for our customers.</li><li><strong>Result:</strong> The redesigned code interface and onboarding flow for the SDK meant an integration could be completed in 10mn, we became better at tracking drop off points and best of all, <strong>we started recording developers self-serving and integrating the SDK without the sales team getting involved</strong>, building a new engine of growth for the company.</li></ol><p>These 2 examples show how when strategically used, design can directly impact a company’s success. In both examples, I did not over invest in design initially in order to identify the pain points before addressing them, but I was carefully watching users and ‘waiting around the corner’ for problems, almost provoking them to measure their importance. If I wasn’t ‘looking’ for these problems, my team and I could have missed opportunities to fix them, or even worse, fixed something that didn’t need to be fixed.</p><blockquote>The quality of a solution is a product of how well we understand the problem it solves and for whom — all of which falls within the scope of design. Ultimately, this means Design is not just about aesthetics; it is the strategic intelligence that maximises Business Value.</blockquote><p>In both cases, I didn’t over-invest in “pixel perfection” initially. I used a lean approach — waiting to see where users struggled to access value — and then deployed design strategically to remove those specific barriers.</p><p><a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-design/our-insights/the-business-value-of-design"">McKinsey data</a> backs this approach, showing that companies who treat design as a cross-functional business lever (not just a studio) see 3<strong>2% higher revenue growth</strong> than their peers.</p><p>Real UX isn’t just about making things easy (or pretty); it’s about making the business viable.</p><h3>📚 Further Reading &amp; References</h3><p>For those interested in the data and theory behind these concepts, here are the foundational resources referenced in this article:</p><ul><li><strong>The Business Value of Design (McKinsey &amp; Company):</strong> The definitive report analysing 300 companies over five years, proving that top-quartile design scorers increase revenues and shareholder returns at nearly twice the rate of their industry peers. <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-design/our-insights/the-business-value-of-design"">Read the full report here.</a></li><li><strong>The Gulf of Execution (Nielsen Norman Group):</strong> A deeper dive into Don Norman’s framework on why users fail to interact with products. <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/two-gulfs-evaluation-execution/"">Read the summary here</a>.</li><li><strong>Product-Led Growth (OpenView):</strong> If you are interested in how companies like Stripe and Duolingo use product experience as their primary growth engine, OpenView’s guide is the industry standard. <a href=""https://openviewpartners.com/product-led-growth/"">Read the guide.</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=207cfe19fdc1"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-ux-directly-impacts-p-l-207cfe19fdc1"">How UX directly impacts P&amp;L</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

These ideas tend to resonate deeply. Many students are drawn to design precisely because they want to create positive social and environmental change.</p><p>What design programs rarely prepare students for is how little agency designers often have once they enter professional practice. And this challenge doesn’t disappear with experience. When my co-author <a href=""https://medium.com/u/47c37d1ba5a7"">Steve 'Doc' Baty</a> and I toured our book <em>Designing Tomorrow</em>, the most common question we heard was not <em>what </em>designers should do differently — but <em>how </em>to drive positive change in the face of resistance.</p><p>How to get buy-in from bosses, managers, co-workers, clients, partner organisations — or whoever pays the bills — is a deceptively difficult problem. It’s why the third part of <em>Designing Tomorrow</em>, which focuses on partnerships, may be its most important. Across three chapters, we explore collaboration, buy-in, and the shift from doing good work to becoming a strategic leader.</p><p>This article, co-written with <a href=""https://medium.com/u/47c37d1ba5a7"">Steve 'Doc' Baty</a>, distils those chapters into six practical strategies for driving positive change from within organisations.</p><h4>#1—Understanding how an organisation operates</h4><p>Driving change requires effective collaboration within the organisation and with external partners. Understanding how an organisation operates is the precursor for assembling those collaborators.</p><p>There are three parts to understanding an organisation. The first part relates to how the organisation is structured, including its department and decision-making processes.</p><p>The second part is to have a thorough understanding of the organisation’s goals and how it positions itself to achieve these goals through its strategic plan.</p><p>The third part concerns the challenges the organisation faces. By understanding those challenges, we are able to align positive change projects with them and select partners that bring complimentary skills to the collaboration.</p><p>Put together these three parts contribute to the organisation’s DNA. They drive the culture and behaviour and enable or hinder the adoption of new ways of working.</p><p>If we understand the DNA, we can alter it, for example, by bringing perspectives from different departments together, reconfiguring perspectives and opening up new possibilities.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows three stacked yellow boxes labeled “Organisational Structure,” “Goals of the Organisation,” and “Challenges Faced by the Organisation.” Each box is paired with guiding questions. These ask about department structure, information flow, and decision-making; short-, mid-, and long-term goals and strategies; and known, emerging, and sector-wide challenges and their impact on operations. The design uses progressively darker shades of yellow from top to bottom."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HcSXFZ0hB2VfBI5y2cKtlw.png"" /><figcaption><em>Questions to consider for developing a clear and thorough understanding of how an organisation works / </em>Source: <a href=""https://www.designingtomorrowbook.com/"">designingtomorrowbook.com</a></figcaption></figure><h4>#2—Strategic alignment with KPIs</h4><p>Change in organisations starts and stops with key performance indicators (KPIs). A new initiative that doesn’t align with an organisation’s metrics is not likely to be supported by management.</p><p>Designers may not be the ones setting an organisation’s KPIs, but we can use the power of KPIs by articulating how a proposed initiative aligns with them.</p><p>In the <a href=""https://pieramattioli.medium.com/theory-of-change-a-guiding-framework-and-a-mindset-to-embrace-dcd42fda4252"">Theory of Change</a> framework, KPIs are the things that can be measured—captured in the ‘outcomes’ section of the framework. We can use this as a starting point and look for inspiration from other organisations and sectors.</p><figure><img alt=""A diagram illustrating a logic model for a company’s plan and expected results. It consists of five stacked sections from top to bottom: Inputs, Activities, Outputs, Outcomes, and Impact. On the left, two vertical labels separate the sections: My Company’s Plan ” (covering Inputs and Activities) and “My Company’s Expected Results” (covering Outputs, Outcomes, and Impact). The sections are shaded in yellow tones with wavy dividers."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wYHSixEhpLXsJ98v7adYnQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>The Theory of Change canvas helps link KPIs with broader outcomes and impact that an organisation aims to achieve / </em>Source: <a href=""https://www.designingtomorrowbook.com/"">designingtomorrowbook.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>For example, Patagonia is a company that successfully employs KPIs to drive positive change. In addition to tracking their business’s carbon footprint, they measure water usage, energy consumption, waste production, proportion of products made using recycled or organic materials, and the number of employees and suppliers engaged in sustainability initiatives.</p><p>If it is not possible to align a proposal with existing KPIs, we may be able to turn to external rating schemes. For example, many organisations refer in some way or another to the <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/goals"">United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a>, which comprise measurable targets and indicators.</p><p>Designers might even be able to shape an organisation’s KPIs, especially at times when a company updates their strategic plan. To do this, we can employ strategic design tools like a <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/the-ux-butterfly-effect-58dd180a0e13"">systems map or impact ripple canvas</a>, identifying the things that matter and that should be measured.</p><p>We can use design activities to bring together the relevant actors to explore how a different set of KPIs would establish measurable principles to drive the desired behaviour and organisational culture and help our organisation fare better in the future.</p><p>Importantly, we need to ask ourselves (and our organisation) whose benefit should be measured and how. What are the things we want to change in our system? How can we achieve this change? Who are entities that may have been overlooked and are negatively affected by existing KPIs? The answers to these questions become the starting point for creating powerful and far-reaching change metrics.</p><p>Expanding your systems map can be a good method of identifying entities who may be being overlooked. They’re often represented outside existing system boundaries, and treated as external to the things the organisation cares about. Extending the system boundary is also a good opportunity to ask questions about the organisation’s scope of impact.</p><h4>#3—Making a business case</h4><p>To successfully argue for organisational change, designers need to be able to speak the language of management and understand the forces that drive markets and economies. (That’s one of the reasons why business and economics principles should be taught in design programs.)</p><p>Business decisions are often driven by cost efficiency arguments. Countering those arguments requires hard data, not emotional storytelling. This doesn’t need to be financial data or involve complex modelling; it can emerge from analysing similar business cases and providing economics-driven alternative options.</p><p>The core of a successful business case is a persuasive business model. Designers are already assisting organisations with developing their business models—largely enabled by the introduction of the <a href=""https://www.strategyzer.com/library/the-business-model-canvas"">business model canvas</a> as a tool for customer-led innovation.</p><p>The extended <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652616307442"">triple layered business model canvas</a> holistically integrates economic, environmental, and social concerns. It adds two layers to the original canvas.</p><p>The environmental layer uses a life cycle perspective to determine the environmental impact of a product or service, placing functional value at its centre. The canvas includes building blocks for use phase, end-of-life, and distribution considerations. Instead of cost structure and revenue streams, it considers environmental impacts and benefits.</p><p>The social layer places social value at the centre, and its building blocks include local communities and societal culture. Instead of cost structure and revenue streams, here the focus is on social impact and benefits.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows yellow boxes outlining stages in a coffee product lifecycle: supplies and outsourcing, production, materials, functional value, end-of-life, distribution, and use phase. It includes percentages for carbon footprint contributions, such as 28% from cup washing and 46.6% from the use phase. At the bottom, environmental impacts and benefits are noted, including a 20.7% carbon footprint reduction from machine redesign between 2008 and 2012."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*u8_NIzL6o2wr_-rqfahFNA.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The image summarizes social aspects of a coffee supply chain in yellow boxes.

It visualises both the opportunity and the risks of not implementing the change.</p><p>Hartmut Esslinger, founder of frog design, in his book <em>The Fine Line</em> recounts facing many cynical CFOs, asking him what he would do if they opposed his firm’s proposal. His response was for the CFOs to imagine what their competitors would do with the idea and how that would affect the company’s bottom line within three years.</p><h4>#4—Using the power of consumers</h4><p>One way to get management’s attention is to highlight the risk of losing customers — or missing emerging segments — to competitors.</p><p>In the European Union, <a href=""https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2022/733543/EPRS_BRI(2022)733543_EN.pdf"">56 percent of consumers pay attention to the environmental impact of products and services</a>. Two thirds of consumers say that they would buy more sustainable products even if they were more expensive.</p><p>Globally, <a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211014005090/en/Recent-Study-Reveals-More-Than-a-Third-of-Global-Consumers-Are-Willing-to-Pay-More-for-Sustainability-as-Demand-Grows-for-Environmentally-Friendly-Alternatives"">85 percent of people reported having shifted their purchase behaviour</a> by opting for more sustainable choices. Attitudes vary across generations and countries, with younger people more likely to seek out sustainable alternatives.</p><p><a href=""https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/consumer-intelligence-series/consumer-and-employee-esg-expectations.html"">Three quarters of consumers say they will stop buying</a> from companies that behave poorly towards the environment, employees, or the community in which they operate. Close to <a href=""https://www.forrester.com/blogs/european-consumers-drive-the-sustainability-demand/"">two thirds of consumers agree that companies have a responsibility</a> to protect the environment, but only one third trust that companies act on their climate commitments.</p><figure><img alt=""The image presents sustainability-related consumer statistics using bold text and icons.

Based on their work with communities, they developed a collective framework, setting out five conditions for aligning the different end goals of partners.</p><p>These conditions support collaboration amongst governments, business, and other organisations. The framework acknowledges that no single organisation can solve a large-scale problem on its own: a collective effort is needed to create meaningful and lasting change.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3uzVjIi1hjOxswZ46XDDmw.png"" /><figcaption><em>The five conditions of collective impact / Source:</em> <a href=""https://www.designingtomorrowbook.com/"">designingtomorrowbook.com</a> (based on <a href=""https://collectiveimpactforum.org/what-is-collective-impact/"">original diagram</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>To develop the conditions, designers can run a participatory systems mapping session to identify a common agenda, use the Theory of Change canvas to create shared measurements, and employ futuring tools like <a href=""https://designthinkmakebreakrepeat.com/toolkit/backcasting/"">backcasting</a> to formulate a mutually reinforcing action plan.</p><p>The backbone organisation plays a key role in aligning and coordinating the collective impact partnership. But this doesn’t necessarily need to involve establishing a new organisation, and we don’t need to wait for permission. The role can be allocated to an existing team or a specifically assembled group of representatives from across the organisation.</p><h4>#6—Starting with small change that compounds over time</h4><p>A massive shift is required to move away from the exploitation of natural resources and the systems that reinforce inequality and social fragmentation. For decades, the global economy has been shaped by neoliberalism, prioritising private profit over our shared social and ecological wellbeing.</p><p>Changing this feels overwhelming — especially for designers driven by an ambition to create positive social and environmental change, yet constrained at every step by systems that resist it.</p><p>This tension doesn’t exist only at an individual level. Through her work with entrepreneurs, Kari Enge, founder of Rank &amp; File, has observed a recurring pattern: organisations rarely feel they have enough time or budget to implement meaningful change. As a result, action is often deferred — pushed into an indefinite future when the necessary resources are assumed to appear.</p><p>This is where organisations fall over, time and time again. They look for ways to make a large, immediate change, failing to understand that positive change can start small and compound over time.</p><p><a href=""https://www.gofoundation.org.au/"">GO Foundation</a>, is an Australian organisation that supports Indigenous children in their education so that they can see themselves as the kind of person who finishes school: someone who takes on further education and embarks on a career while also maintaining their connection to culture and Country.</p><p>The foundation started with a small number, but those kids became role models to inspire others to make different choices for themselves. Each child going through this transformation influences more and more around them.</p><p>If the founders of the GO Foundation, when they started the organisation, had said, ‘helping just a few kids isn’t worth it, we should wait until we can help 100 or 1,000’, they would have missed out on years of impactful support or never created any change at all.</p><p>The key to successful change in the face of obstacles is to look for these kinds of impactful, small changes. The things we can do right now—as individuals and organisations—that have a compounding effect over time.</p><p>This requires us to be selective and focus our energies on the actions that begin to affect change, however small.</p><p>In fictional stories about time travel, the protagonists often worry that some tiny action they make will radically change the future. Yet, here we are in the present, thinking nothing we do can make a difference.</p><p>Reversing this perspective can imbue a great sense of empowerment: we can look for the small changes we can make now to deliver an impactful effect in the future.</p><p>This can start small, by focusing on what sits within our direct control: actions we can take without waiting for permission.</p><p>Like changing the language we use — replacing the colonial term <em>stakeholders</em> with <em>actors</em>; creating a systems map to surface potential unintended consequences; or forming a collective of like-minded colleagues and making space for conversations about driving positive impact.</p><p>Systems rarely invite change — designers build the conditions for it, one small step at a time.</p><figure><img alt=""The text “one percent” in white font and the word “change” in black font on a yellow background."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1003/0*QEazE8SVaneeb_rz"" /><figcaption>As designers, we can achieve a significant impact through implementing small change that has a compounding effect over time</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Thank you for reading this article.

As professional online shoppers, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/most-wanted"">Refinery29 Most Wanted writers</a> have a spidey sense for the best virtual sales and limited-time offers.

Today, we bring you the best sales across fashion, beauty, and homeware happening this weekend. Gird your loins — or err, wallets. <br /><br />The deals on this list must meet at least one of the following criteria: The discount is applied to a Refinery29 brand (according to our anonymous shopping data), it takes a minimum of 20% off the full price, or it's an item that's rarely discounted, making even a slight price cut worth noting. The following 28 sales are ones to watch and worthy of a spot in all budget-friendly carts — at least, in our opinion.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

<p>If you’ve ever loved a beauty product, then you’ve likely also experienced what it felt like to lose it. Whether it was a beloved moisturizer that was discontinued or a reformulated lipstick shade that was never quite the same, we’ve all been there. And if you’re one of the thousands (I can only assume) of people who adore Armani’s Luminous Silk Foundation, what comes next might be hard to hear, but you’ve been warned. </p>



<p>After launching in 2000 (turn of the century!), Armani Luminous Silk Foundation skyrocketed to popularity, becoming one of the most frequently name-dropped products among celebrities like Gemma Chan and Kim Kardashian, and makeup artists like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tobimakeup/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tobi Henney</a>. (One 2020 statistic even reported the brand <a href=""https://www.thezoereport.com/beauty/armani-beauty-luminous-silk-foundation-sells-1000-bottles-every-day-heres-why-44969437"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">sold 1,000 bottles of Luminous Silk</a> per day.) So you may be wondering why Armani would replace an existing bestseller, even after 25 years — and you’d be right to do so. But before you run to your nearest Sephora to stock up on your old shade, here’s everything you need to know about the new version of the cult classic, <a href=""https://www.giorgioarmanibeauty-usa.com/makeup/face/foundation/luminous-silk-natural-glow-blurring-foundation/ww-01019-arm.html?dwvar_ww-01019-arm_color=6%20-%20Medium%2C%20Neutral%20Olive&amp;dwvar_ww-01019-arm_size=30ml"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Luminous Silk Natural Glow Blurring Foundation</a>. </p>

<h2>Why did Armani reformulate its iconic Luminous Silk Foundation? </h2>



<p>As the name suggests, the OG Armani Luminous Silk Foundation was touted as a medium-to-full coverage product that enhanced skin’s natural radiance. The upgraded formula, <a href=""https://www.giorgioarmanibeauty-usa.com/makeup/face/foundation/luminous-silk-natural-glow-blurring-foundation/ww-01019-arm.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Luminous Silk Natural Glow Blurring Foundation</a>, captures the same soft-glow finish with a thinner, more blendable texture. Then, there is the addition of skincare-first ingredients like niacinamide to brighten and curb oil production — an especially welcome addition for those prone to oily skin like myself, who notice that foundation can sometimes enhance shine and greasiness. Another notable addition to the foundation is glycerin, an emollient and humectant that helps draw in moisture and lock it in place. </p>



<h2>What’s different about Armani’s new Luminous Silk Natural Glow Blurring Foundation? </h2>



<p>Whether you’re hitting a red carpet (relatable!) or simply looking for a workhorse complexion perfector for every day, Armani Luminous Silk had mass appeal in spades due to its silky texture, moderate coverage, and luxe cachet. (Put simply, having this in your makeup bag made you That Girl.)  </p>



<p>But as is often the case, not everyone was convinced. Some reviewers wanted a better finish for drier skin types, while others said it oxidized quickly. Since its launch, countless brands have introduced foundations powered by increasingly high-tech formulas. With this in mind, Rena Hayashi, Armani Beauty’s head of research and development, reveals that the reformulation was inevitable. “Even for an icon like Luminous Silk, consumer expectations evolve,” Hayashi says of the four-year reformulation process. She adds, “The driving inspiration was to meet today’s demand for foundations that offer an even more seamless, true-to-skin match and act as an extension of one’s skincare routine, not just makeup.” </p>



<p>I’m notoriously picky when it comes to foundation, but even I was blown away by how Armani’s Luminous Silk looked, and most importantly, felt on my skin. I was a true fan of the original Luminous Silk, but typically reserved it for special occasions that warranted a more glam look. As such, a natural, skincare-inspired version of Luminous Silk sounded right up my alley. </p>



<h2>What to know about Armani Luminous Silk Foundation:  </h2>



<p>– Available in 44 shades (including 18 brand-new ones to better suit a variety of undertones) <br />– Provides medium coverage with a glowy finish <br />– Includes skincare ingredients, including glycerin and niacinamide in a non-comedogenic formulation </p>



<h2>Is Armani’s new Luminous Silk Natural Glow Blurring Foundation good?  </h2>



<p>Like any liquid foundation, how you choose to apply it depends on the amount of coverage desired, as well as the finish you’re looking to achieve. However, one thing that immediately stood out to me during the testing process was how the new Luminous Silk truly disappeared into my skin, leaving behind a veil of coverage that looked like my skin, but better. Makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/cgonzalezbeauty/?hl=en"">Carolina Gonzalez</a> (who’s glammed celebrities like Sabrina Carpenter and Gigi Hadid) echoes this as one of Luminous Silk’s most notable upgrades. <s> </s>“The biggest standout for me is that it feels even more skin-like — it minimizes any texture on the skin, which I love, and gives a gorgeous soft-focus effect,” she says.  </p>



<p>My favorite way to apply foundation is to dot tiny amounts directly onto my face where I need the most coverage, and buff it out with a fluffy brush for an airbrushed effect that I can dial up if needed. And according to Gonzalez, the new Luminous Silk is more versatile than ever: “If I want a natural, soft-glam finish, I’ll use a foam wedge or my hands to really melt it into the skin,” she explains. “When I want more coverage, I typically use a brush and work it into the skin.”  </p>



<p>But no matter how you apply it, the consensus remains the same: “What I love most about this formula is that no matter how it’s applied or how many layers you build, you always get the same beautiful, skin-like result.” Beauty content creator Alexis Androulakis of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thelipsticklesbians/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Lipstick Lesbians</a> did a <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DTYLyD0EalN/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">side-by-side</a> comparison, touting the comfortable wear and less drying texture of the reformulation. However, she also noted that the two are more alike than different, especially in terms of the signature satin finish. </p>



<h2>Where can you get Armani Luminous Silk Foundation? </h2>



<p>The new-and-improved Armani Luminous Silk is currently available on <a href=""https://www.giorgioarmanibeauty-usa.com/makeup/face/foundation/luminous-silk-natural-glow-blurring-foundation/ww-01019-arm.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Armani Beauty’s website</a> and at select retailers including <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/luminous-silk-natural-glow-blurring-liquid-foundation-with-24-hour-wear-P519887"">Sephora</a> and <a href=""https://www.nordstrom.com/s/armani-beauty-luminous-silk-natural-glow-blurring-foundation-with-24-hour-wear/8688069"">Nordstrom</a> for $69 (a small increase from the previous price of $64).  </p>



<h2>Final Thoughts </h2>



<p>For the price, I was expecting to be blown away by the new Luminous Silk, and I have to admit that I vastly prefer it to the original. Luminous Silk Natural Glow has replaced my everyday foundation since I can sheer it out so easily, depending on how and how much I apply. (I also wore it recently to an event and my skin looked flawless for over seven hours, even with plenty of talking, eating, and drinking.)  </p>



<p>Is it a pricey product? Definitely — easily one of the most expensive in my collection. That said, it had impossibly large shoes to fill — not to mention a viciously loyal customer base willing to go to war — and I think it’s exceeded expectations. (The only piece of criticism I have is that I don’t get much of a blurring effect, which I love for minimizing the appearance of pores, texture, and acne scars. That said, I still like it overall as a foundation.) I can only wonder what we’ll be saying 25 years from now, when the 3.0 version hits our counters… </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/january-monthly-horoscope-2026-meanings-effects"">This January</a>, the sun’s entrance into Aquarius on the 19th brings a sense of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/age-gap-friendship-benefits-different-generations"">camaraderie and friendship</a> for you. The water bearer wants us to partake in collective joy and join forces with neighbors to manifest a communal bond. Better yet, it’ll give us the opportunity to think, love, and speak freely, without any judgment. Oh, and did I mention it’s time to cheer? We are cheering the unknown, praising the divine forces that lead us on an unknown path which enriches our lives with knowledge and intelligence. </p>



<p>If you have been trying to create your vision, then Aquarius season is a month in which we can bring novel ideas to the forefront of our minds; now is the best time to do so. The reason is that Aquarius is a sign of innovation, making it an extraordinary moment to jumpstart projects and ventures. Even if the naysayers want to dampen our spirit, we will not let them because we’re on the path to strike gold. Believing in ourselves and all we do is pivotal to ensure we are able to construct our visions in the best way possible. </p>



<p>The Aquarius stellium [when three or more planets come together] of 2026 includes the sun, Venus, Mercury, and Mars’s ingress into the Air sign. Add in Pluto, which has been in Aquarius for some time, and we have a spicy and desirable energy. At times, we may be more stubborn and inflexible in our ideology. We’ll be prone to preach about our values and want others to follow our lead. Pluto is bringing in the heat — especially when it forms a conjunction with the sun in Aquarius. The cazimi effect of the sun and Pluto’s connection urges us to evolve and transform, after arguments, jealousies, control issues, triangular situations, and power struggles arise.  </p>



<p>The upcoming weeks will bring life-changing events. The solar eclipse on February 17th marks the beginning of the lunar new year and ushers us into a new state of being. The year of the Fire Horse is giving us the passion to attain our aspirations without looking back. The eclipse ushers us to think outside the box and to embrace our individuality, due to its proximity to Uranus in Taurus. The applying square offers us autonomy and excitement to reach for the stars and make our aspirations happen on our own terms. The effects of the eclipse will be felt the most when the North Node of Destiny enters Aquarius on July 26th. </p>



<p>Pay attention to how we can <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/befriend-neighbours-social-life"">support the local community</a> and the charities we wish to invest our time in by giving back. We can understand that it’s essential to help others on their journey, as it gives them a sense of hope and offers kindness. We are all connected in one way or another. Aquarius season wants us to do our best and be the most genuine versions of ourselves. By doing so, we are making the universe better. </p>

<p>The New Moon on January 18th is coming in hotter than a steamy matcha latte! The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cancer-new-moon-horoscope-2026-meaning-effects"">first New Moon of 2026</a> is going to have a significant impact on how we kick off the year and the standard we implement for ourselves. The astrology for this lunar event is going to be intense — the only way out is through. By that, I mean the best way to handle the New Moon is to put ourselves first. For many, this will be challenging because 2025 was a year in which we selflessly gave to others. Since <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/yearly-horoscope-2026"">2026 is a numerically number one year</a> (2 + 0 + 2 + 6 = 10, and 1 + 0 = 1), it’s time to switch up that vibe. No more playing nice, it’s time to start doing more for us than we do for others. Here we go!  </p>



<p>New Moons occur at the beginning of the lunar cycle. They initiate a time of beginnings and fresh starts, allowing us to set intentions for the month ahead. We can manifest and bring our desires to light, igniting our dreams and putting them into fruition. At this moment, the sun and moon come together in the same sign and degree, forming a conjunction. The connection of these celestial entities brightens our drive, but curtails our intuition. The technical term for the alignment of the sun, earth, and moon is syzygy. Every New Moon has a different flavor, promise, and message — this lunation is no exception. </p>



<p>The New Moon links up with Mercury and Mars in Capricorn, Saturn in Pisces, Uranus retrograde in Taurus, and Neptune in Pisces. Although Jupiter retrograde in Cancer is farther away, it’ll lend an extremist energy, escalating the planetary energy. The same day, Mercury faces off with Mars and Saturn. The healing centaur, Chiron in Aries, and the liberating asteroid Lilith, which is in Scorpio, add a cosmic punch. All these elements are urging us to act toward starting fresh, which will not be easy. Why? We aren’t ready to let go of our old ways of thinking and feeling. Rather than relinquish us from habits, situations, or relationships that aren’t serving our highest good, we’ll drag our feet.  </p>



<p>It may seem that each step forward is accompanied by a setback. The challenge is comprehending that rather than trying to push forward, we must take a moment to meditate on our current position to assess the path we want to take. Although Mars is hyperactive in the New Moon activity, the correspondence it shares with Neptune is going to have a standing still, so instead of trying to make waves, we should really meditate on how we feel or what we are willing to incorporate and dismiss from our lives.  </p>



<p>Saturn serves as a stabilizing force. The karmic and responsible planet is in watery Pisces, a place known for dismantling boundaries; we are learning to set limits, not just with others, but with ourselves as well. This entails adopting a new mindset for all of us, allowing us to understand that we don’t have to put pressure on a specific timeline to evolve. With the New Moon occurring on the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">last day of Capricorn season</a>, we might want to jump forward. Remember, growth takes time and happens progressively. The less we stress and compare ourselves with those who appear to be doing better than us, the easier it’ll be to move at our own pace. </p>



<p>However, that doesn’t mean power struggles won’t ensue. In some circumstances, the stew has been brewing and simmering for a while, and now it’s ready to boil over. Jealousies are heightened due to insecurities, making us feel as though we aren’t good enough. We are! We must focus on the positive attributes within ourselves, not give others too much leverage, and refrain from arguing over feelings. If they aren’t going to acknowledge how they’ve repressed us, then it’s time to consider disconnecting. The only opinion that matters is our own when it comes to our heartfelt sentiments. Gaslighting and emotional manipulation can be used to gain sympathy, which is why we must draw a line in the sand. Protecting our energy and aura is vital.  </p>

<p>For years, romance fans have been patiently waiting for our <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2020/09/10034159/erotic-romance-books-with-sex-scenes"">fave romance novels</a> to be adapted into movies. During the onscreen <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-romantic-comedies"">rom-com drought</a> of the past couple decades (with a few notable exceptions), romance novels were there, carrying the weight of depicting all the different ways we fall in love. For some reason, for a while Hollywood decided romantic intimacy wasn’t something people wanted to watch onscreen, but the <a href=""https://www.writersdigest.com/the-billion-dollar-genre-why-romance-writing-matters"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">billion-dollar book industry </a>proves people want horny, smart, romantic stories. And <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/article/emily-henry-books.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Emily Henry</a> is one of the genre’s most prolific and adored authors. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2026/01/11954048/people-we-meet-on-vacation-book-movie-differences"">Netflix’s</a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2026/01/11954048/people-we-meet-on-vacation-book-movie-differences""> People We Meet On Vacation</a></em>, adapted from Henry’s novel and starring Tom Blyth and Emily Bader, is already a smash hit — and it’s only been streaming for a week. Blyth and Bader are Alex and Poppy, best friends who take vacations together, strictly as friends, until their carefully defined arrangement starts to feel less… defined. Their platonic trips take a turn and, well, romantic hijinks ensue. </p>



<p>All anyone really wants from a good rom-com is great chemistry between its leads. When we met up with Henry and <em><a href=""https://people.com/where-was-people-we-meet-on-vacation-filmed-all-about-the-netflix-show-s-real-life-locations-11886201"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">People We Meet On Vacation’s</a></em><a href=""https://people.com/where-was-people-we-meet-on-vacation-filmed-all-about-the-netflix-show-s-real-life-locations-11886201"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> </a>director Brett Haley at the film’s press junket in New Orleans, they told us that it was Blyth and Bader’s connection that made them know the movie would be something special. “I saw the chemistry read they did together and that was all it really took for me,” Henry said to Refinery29’s Dawnie Jefferson. Haley agreed: “The most important thing was the chemistry. And once we saw them work together, we knew that this was gonna work. I needed to see that oil and water thing happen, but I call it oil and vinegar — salad dressing when you shake it up. Delicious. That was them.” </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955119.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>People We Meet on Vacation. (L-R) Emily Bader as Poppy and Tom Blyth as Alex in People We Meet on Vacation. Cr. Daniel Escale/Netflix © 2025</figcaption></figure>



<p>Blyth and Bader are great in the movie that actually improves on its source material (Henry teased that <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/emily-henry-adaptations-announcement-funny-story-happy-place"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">her next adaptation</a> will be of her lauded novel, <em>Beach Read</em>) and embody their characters — Alex is a rule-following stickler and Poppy is a free-spirited nonconformist — with humor and heart. “Tom is nothing like Alex. He’s a charismatic loose guy,” Haley said. “The only thing he has in common with Alex is that he’s handsome.” Henry echoes that Blyth is “silly” in real life and we witness that vibe in person. During our interview, Blyth is funny and irreverent, getting distracted repeatedly by the chaotic noises flowing in from the New Orleans streets. And Bader, who both Henry and Haley said is similar to  her character Poppy, is playful and bubbly. Both actors were on the verge of starring in Netflix’s #1 movie (<a href=""https://variety.com/2026/film/news/people-we-meet-on-vacation-ratings-netflix-movie-1236630279/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">17.2 million views</a> in its first weekend!) and unlocking a new level of success in both of their careers. It felt a bit like talking to a young Hanks and Ryan, and the duo cited <em>When Harry Met Sally </em>and <em>You’ve Got Mail</em> as their biggest inspirations for the movie. </p>



<p>Here, Blyth and Bader talk about why men need to yearn more, Poppy and Alex’s attachment issues and how the movie’s already iconic dance scene came together.  </p>



<p><strong>Refinery29: Congratulations. Loved the movie! Thank you for making such a great film for me to watch over and over.  </strong></p>



<p><strong>Emily Bader:</strong> Thank you! </p>



<p><strong>Poppy and Alex are an example of the “friends to lovers” trope that is very popular in rom-coms. Why </strong><strong>do you think “friends to lovers” works? Is it the best trope? </strong></p>



<p><strong>EB: </strong>The best trope? I think everyone’s gonna have a different opinion about that but I do like enemies to lovers as well. I don’t know if I could pick one, but I think people love it because it’s about yearning. It’s a lot of yearning.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Blyth:</strong> Yearning is very in style at the moment,</p>



<p><strong>EB: </strong>Has yearning ever gone out of style?</p>



<p><strong>TB: </strong>No, but it’s a whole thing right now. Everyone’s loving yearning, apparently.</p>



<p><strong>EB: </strong>I’ve loved yearning since I saw <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>.</p>



<p><strong>TB: </strong>Fair enough! </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Men like to pretend that we’re all tough and don’t have a soft inside, but we have a big soft inside, and I think the yearning allows that to come out. Men should yearn. </p><cite>tom blyth on yearning in ‘people we meet on vacation’</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>That’s a great segue because there is quite a lot of yearning in the book and in the movie, mainly by Alex. Tom, why do you think that it’s important to see men yearning on screen?</strong></p>



<p><strong>EB: </strong>That’s an amazing question. </p>



<p><strong>TB:</strong> Why is it important to see men yearning on screen? You know why? Because men like to pretend that we’re all tough and don’t have a soft inside, but we have a big soft inside, and I think the yearning allows that to come out. Men should yearn. It puts you in a vulnerable place. And it’s good to be vulnerable.</p>



<p><strong>It really is! </strong></p>



<p>TB: Bada bing, bada boom!</p>



<p>EB: Bada bing. bada boom<em> [laughs]. </em></p>



<p><strong>Tom, would you consider yourself a yearner? </strong></p>



<p><strong>TB: </strong>Yeah, at times. Yeah. I can be quite romantic. Yes, definitely when I was a lot younger. I definitely yearned. Painfully yearned. And that’s all I’m gonna say on that.</p>



<p><strong>We won’t push it, but I would love to know more.</strong></p>



<p><strong>TB:</strong> I can see you wanting to push the line of questioning. I was like. No!<em> [laughs].</em> No names.</p>



<p><strong>We’ll keep it safe. For both of you, would you consider yourselves an Alex or a Poppy in real life?</strong></p>



<p><strong>EB:</strong> I’m a Poppy for sure.</p>



<p><strong>TB:</strong> I think we are both more Poppy than Alex. Well, it depends. There are moments.</p>



<p><strong>EB: </strong>You have Alex tendencies. Today, when you were doing the thing, it kind of made me open my mind. </p>

<p><strong>There are so many moments in the movie when you just want these two characters to just get over themselves and make out. You’re watching it like, </strong><strong><em>please just kiss</em></strong><strong>! </strong></p>



<p><strong>EB:</strong> Kiss! </p>



<p><strong>Ultimately, what do you think is the biggest reason they’re too scared to be together?</strong></p>



<p><strong>EB: </strong>I think it’s because, in their minds, if it goes wrong, the greatest friendship they’ve ever had goes away. And I think there’s a very real possibility of that with them. If it really blew up in their faces at the end of the day, and they weren’t compatible in that way, it would be hard to go back because they would’ve taken such a leap. They’re best friends. </p>



<p><strong>TB:</strong> I also think they’ve built up this expectation in their own mind of what their life is supposed to be like. Poppy’s like, “I’m supposed to be free. I’m supposed to not have any things that hold me back or tie me down.” And Alex is the opposite. He thinks he’s got to have stability. And he wants to live in Linfield where he grew up and he wants to be near his family. And I think sometimes putting expectations on yourself and other people is the death of change. And it holds you back and it stops you from being changeable and malleable. And that’s what you need to be able to fall in love with someone and be vulnerable with someone. At the end, when they let go of their expectation of themselves and each other, they’re able to realize how close they were all along.</p>

<p><strong>EB: </strong>That’s very good.</p>



<p><strong>TB: </strong>I’m philosophizing a lot today.</p>



<p><strong>The dance scene was very cute. What prep went into it and how did it come together?</strong></p>



<p><strong>EB:</strong> We had an awesome choreographer. We went to this church building when we landed in New Orleans — </p>



<p><strong>TB: </strong>We prayed for help <em>[laughs]. </em></p>



<p><strong>EB: </strong>We said “Help us please learn how to dance. Give me rhythm.”<em> [laughs] </em>But we basically came up with ideas, things we’d seen in movies before, moves we wanted to incorporate, and strung them together with her help. She was really amazing.</p>



<p><strong>TB: </strong>And the choreographer filmed us rehearsing it and doing it. And then she would show us how bad it was and say, “this could be better.” She was really supportive. We worked hard on that.</p>



<p><strong>EB: </strong>And you can’t improvise it because you need to shoot it from so many different angles. And it has to be the same.</p>



<p><strong>TB:</strong> But it had to have an improvised feel because they’re not dancers. They’re two people just letting loose. And kind of falling in love while they’re letting loose. And so it had to have that loose quality to it.</p>



<p><strong>I didn’t know you couldn’t dance. It was giving dancers.</strong></p>



<p><strong>EB:</strong> Thank you so much. That was my big fear of mine.</p>



<p><strong>TB:</strong> You didn’t know you could dance either?</p>



<p><strong>EB: </strong>Oh no, I didn’t. I’m still not sure.</p>



<p><strong>TB:</strong> Oh, you’re so good.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955018.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Tarnish-free <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fine-gold-jewelry-under-300"">gold jewelry</a> sounds like the ultimate cheat code — pieces that won’t fade, dull, or turn your skin green, no matter how much you wear them. But do they exist on a budget? The short answer: kind of. Unless you’re investing in solid gold (which is costly), no jewelry is completely resistant to wear over time. But thanks to smarter materials and better plating techniques, you can get long-lasting shine without the hefty price tag. <br /><br />“‘Tarnish-free’ means the jewelry is resistant to discoloration from air, moisture, or skin oils,” explains <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jennieyyoon/"">Jennie Yoon</a>, founder and CEO of <a href=""https://kinnstudio.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kinn Studio</a>. “While no jewelry material is completely immune to wear over time, tarnish-free pieces are designed to maintain their original appearance for much longer.” The key? High-quality base metals, thicker gold layers, and protective coatings that help plated pieces hold up to daily wear. <br /><br />One of the biggest game-changers in affordable jewelry is physical vapor deposition (PVD), a high-tech plating method that makes gold layers tougher, thicker, and more resistant to fading. “Recent advancements like PVD coating, thicker micron plating, and anti-tarnish treatments allow us to create beautiful, long-lasting pieces at a price point that is accessible to more people,” Yoon explains. <br /><br />But longevity isn’t just about the plating method — it also comes down to how you wear and care for your jewelry. “Avoid exposure to water, sweat, and chemicals like perfumes or cleaning products,” Yoon advises. “Storing your pieces in a cool, dry place and cleaning them with a soft cloth can make a huge difference in keeping them looking new… A well-made piece of plated jewelry can last for years with proper care.” <br /><br />So what’s the difference between gold plating, vermeil, and solid gold? Gold plating is the most affordable, but it’s also the least durable — just a thin layer of gold over brass or stainless steel. Vermeil is a step up, with a thicker layer of gold over sterling silver, making it more resistant to tarnishing. And solid gold? That’s literally the gold standard for jewelry that stays pristine forever — but at a cost. Ahead, we’re breaking down the best tarnish-free gold jewelry brands for everyday wear — whether you’re looking for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/engagement-ring-trends-2025"">an investment piece</a>, fun Valentine’s Day-coded <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/heart-shaped-jewelry-ring-necklace-earrings-bracelet"">heart-shaped design</a>, or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gold-hoop-earrings"">everyday go-to hoops</a> that won’t quit.</p>

<p>Session manicurist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/amistreets/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ami Streets</a> says iced coffee glass nails are so popular right now because they tap into what she calls the soft luxury aesthetic. “Amplified by social media and satisfying magnetic effects, iced coffee nails feel modern, elevated, and luxurious,” says Streets. She explains that it blends multiple major trends: “Think glazed and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glass-french-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">glass finishes</a>, as well as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/11/11185958/velvet-nails-trend-magentic-gel-manicure"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">magnetic manicures</a>,” she says, essentially cat-eye polish, which contains magnetic particles that are maneuvered into place with a magnet before it cures. </p>



<p>While ribbed glass nails come in a variety of shades, one color palette seems to be reigning supreme: “Brown tones have been a dominant trending color and are set to continue as a key color movement in 2026,” says Streets. “The warm neutrals paired with a glossy, translucent sheen create depth and movement that mimics coffee in a glass.” We’re just a little bit in love with these espresso nails courtesy of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DTGyzDCFUqQ/?hl=en"">@Nails_ByLes on Instagram</a>. </p>

<h2>How do you achieve iced coffee glass nails? </h2>



<p>Though this manicure might look complicated, an experienced nail artist will know exactly what to do. Streets explains, “To create iced coffee glass nails with a ribbed-glass effect, start with a sheer brown gel base in latte, caramel, or iced-coffee tones.” She adds that your nail tech will layer the polish according to your opacity preference. “One to two thin coats will be more translucent rather than opaque, or for added depth, you can layer a subtle magnetic brown or taupe gel and softly activate the magnet to create gentle movement that mimics liquid in a glass.” </p>



<p>The next step is sealing in the cat-eye color with a high-shine top coat, curing it under a UV lamp, and then applying a <em>matte </em>top coat over the entire nail. “This will help achieve that frosted, iced glass finish,” says Streets. </p>



<p>Now for the finishing touch: once both top coats are cured, a clear builder gel or thick clear top coat is used to draw raised vertical lines, Streets explains. “These extend from the cuticle to the free edge and should be evenly spaced to resemble ribbed drinking glasses,” she says. The nails are then fully cured. “The glossy lines will appear raised while the rest of the nail remains matte,” says Streets, “and it’s the contrast between soft-focus glass and high-shine ribs that gives this manicure an elevated, dimensional finish.” </p>



<p>Because there are quite a few steps, don’t expect this to be a quick salon visit. Iced glass nails can take a couple of hours in the salon chair, as moving the magnetic particles into place to make the finish look like liquid takes time and precision. Your nails might take even longer if you’re opting for a builder gel or hard gel base, which requires extra layering and curing. </p>

<p>Take a closer look at some of today’s hottest beauty products, and you’ll likely <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/07/11039889/rhode-skin-care-products-review"">find peptides</a> front and center in the ingredients list. These buzzy <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-squalane-amino-acids-lip-balm-review"">amino acids</a> — which promote hydration and collagen production — have been making their way into everything from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/paulas-choice-pro-collagen-peptide-moisturizer-review"">lightweight moisturizers</a> to viral <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/rhode-pocket-blush-review"">cream blushes</a>, but their most exciting role might be in lip treatments.</p>



<p>“The skin on your lips is very thin and delicate and can be prone to dehydration,” says consultant dermatologist <a href=""http://milenaaesthetic.com"">Dr. Milena Al Mansuri</a>. She adds, “Peptides are therefore great for lips because they help to strengthen the barrier, which in turn helps to lock moisture in; they can also help protect your lips from damaging environmental factors such as the sun and wind.”  (Adding a top layer of sun protection is still essential for your lips, as UV rays can break down collagen.)</p>



<p>But here’s the catch: Peptide lip products can be quite pricy due to the advanced research and technologies behind their formulations. Most cost between $15 and $30, which is a little steep considering you can buy a drugstore lip balm for around $5. </p>



<p>Intrigued — and in the name of providing fair and honest reviews — I decided to put eight of the most popular peptide lip treatments to the test to see which ones truly deliver on their promises. Spoiler alert: one contender totally blew me away — and it’s only $9.</p>

<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11862705.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>Described as a “nourishing lip layer” by founder <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/rhode-peptide-lip-shape-review"">Hailey Bieber</a>, this TikTok-viral bestseller arguably kicked off the peptide lip product craze when it launched in 2022. I’m a late bloomer when it comes to embracing the Rhode hype, but <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rhodeskin.com%2Fproducts%2Fpeptide-lip-treatment"">this treatment</a> made a great first impression. It adds a shiny, non-sticky glaze that sits atop my lips for hours. The consistency is my second-favorite among all the products I’ve tried. Besides the titular ingredient, the formula also features cupuaçu (a type of cacao fruit that maintains skin elasticity) and babassu (an antioxidant that also hydrates the skin).</p>



<p>Some of my initial enthusiasm faded with repeated use. The vanilla scent was very yummy at first, but I got tired of it after using it for a couple of weeks, as it reminded me of artificial sweeteners. (There is an unscented version of the treatment, and all the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/rhode-tinted-lip-review"">Rhode Lip Tints</a> are unscented.) While the texture feels soft and conditioning when I apply it, I don’t find that it moisturizes my lips that much in the long term; I can still feel my lips craving moisture a few hours later, and it does little to heal gritty, flaky skin. I think it’s a bit overhyped, but it’d be a good fit for someone already blessed with well-hydrated lips who wants a coat of long-lasting shine and a side of dessert-inspired fragrance.</p>

<p>Paula’s Choice is aiming for a piece of that peptide hype with its two new launches: The <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fpro-collagen-peptide-plumping-gel-cream-moisturizer-P514671%3FskuId%3D2828424"">Pro-Collagen Peptide Moisturizer</a> (which I enjoyed) and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fpro-collagen-peptide-plumping-gloss-balm-lip-treatment-P514674%3FskuId%3D2828416"">this gloss balm</a>. Out of all the squeezy tube lip products I tested for this story, I liked the applicator on this one the most. It has a slightly curved tip that hugs the contours of the lips, making it easier to disperse just the right amount of product I need. It has a faint, sweet aroma that reminds me of cakes.</p>



<p>A lot of science has gone into the formula, namely three types of peptides — tridecapeptide-1, palmitoyl tripeptide-1, and palmitoyl tripeptide-38. I asked <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dremmaclinics/"">Dr. Emma Cunningham</a>, medical director at <a href=""https://dr-emma.co.uk/"">Dr. Emma Clinics</a>, to explain their benefits: “Tripeptide has three amino acids [the building blocks of proteins] and is great for general skin repair, improving hydration and strengthening the skin barrier,” she says. “It’s smaller, so it absorbs quickly and works quickly.” I can confirm that it works well, as I wake up with softer and more hydrated lips when I’ve slathered this treatment on before bed. My only gripe? It is quite expensive, and I fear I might go through the whole rube rather quickly.</p>

<p>I have Suni Lee to thank for discovering this gem. The Olympic gold medalist <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@sunisalee_/video/7409473555802410282?lang=en"">shouted out the product</a> as part of her go-to lip combo, and it has since sold out many times over. I tried the citrus flavor and loved the subtle shimmer it imparts. In addition to peptides, it’s enriched with kokum butter and mango seed butter, which add moisture to the lips. This is the most instantly hydrating treatment out of the bunch, but the texture is a bit too sticky for my liking. The brand says this can be applied over lip color to add extra shine, but it already feels like wearing a heavy coat on its own. I will likely save this one for when it’s brutally cold, and my lips are very dry.</p>

It’s formulated with a 6% tripeptide complex, which promises to smooth out fine lines on the lips, along with plumping and softening benefits. The product has a similar texture to a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-lip-oils-review"">lip oil</a> and doesn’t irritate when I glide it across the cracked parts of my lips. I do notice my lips looking a bit fuller and more defined after a week, but I likely won’t finish the whole tube for one reason alone: it left a bitter, medicinal aftertaste. The product transferred easily, and I can always taste it as it seeps into the corners of my mouth.</p>

I’ll say that the moisturizing benefits aren’t all that noticeable on their own, but it does dial up the efficacy of a lip serum or lip mask when you layer it on top (my favorite pairing has been <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chanel.com%2Fus%2Fskincare%2Fp%2F133330%2Fhydra-beauty-micro-serum-levres-intense-replenishing-hydration%2F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chanel’s Hydra Beauty Lip Serum</a>). It seals in all the goodness, and I love the apple scent and barely-there texture. However, at this price point, it hasn’t impressed me enough, and I have to layer it with another product to get the best results. Its airy, whipped texture is a better fit for summer, especially since it contains vitamin C, an antioxidant that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/antioxidant-serum-sunscreen-skincare"">enhances sun protection</a>.</p>

<p>This one is a sleeper hit that should be TikTok-viral, especially given the affordable price. I tried Ice, a clear color that adds a subtle pearly luster to my lips. It’s like wearing a Y2K-inspired shiny lip gloss without any of the stickiness. My lips feel instantly softer, with a moisturizing top layer that lingers long after I wipe the product off. I attribute this to squalane, an emollient that draws moisture to the skin, alongside nourishing peptides, vitamin E, and avocado oil. It has been my go-to product for prepping my lips before makeup, as it does a remarkable job at smoothing over the cracks, and I’m so drawn to the light grapefruit scent. <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fjuicy-peptide-lip-balm-pimprod2046091%3Fsku%3D2625647"">This one</a> gets an A+ from me: I simply don’t get sick of this product and can’t wait to try the tinted versions.</p>

<p>This is the perfect SOS treatment for when your lips are raw and irritated. Packed <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ceramides-skincare-eczema-dermatitis"">with ceramides,</a> an ingredient I always look for in my moisturizer, it creates a protective barrier on the lips while working overtime to repair the cracks underneath. The bright yellow color comes from sea buckthorn oil, an antioxidant that helps reduce hyperpigmentation and inflammation. I have this next to me when I work from home, and I love the feeling of the cushiony balm over my lips. It proved its worth when my partner recently came home from a ski trip with severely chapped and scaly lips. He popped on <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dermstore.com%2Fp%2Fallies-of-skin-peptide-and-ceramide-repair-lip-balm%2F14759495%2F"">this lip balm,</a> and the flakiness disappeared overnight. </p>

<p>Given how often I use peptides, squalane, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vitamin-b5-hyaluronic-acid-serum-combination"">hyaluronic acid</a> in my skincare, I had high hopes for this one, which contains all three ingredients. The texture appears semi-coagulated, making it a bit too chunky to squeeze out of the tube, but it melts into a nourishing oil once on my lips. I did some research on the product’s Sephora page, and the hard texture seems to be a common complaint after a recent reformulation; some even find the product gritty once applied on the lips, but I didn’t feel any clumps. <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fbiossance-pro-peptide-tm-hydrating-lip-perfector-balm-with-hyaluronic-acid-P513592%3FskuId%3D2797942"">The product</a> does a good job at making my lips bouncier and softer, but the ointment-like texture means that you really feel it weighing on your lips for hours on end. </p>

<p>In April 2021, when most coronavirus restrictions were lifted, and we rejoiced in our newfound freedom, the first thing I did was book into my local salon for a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bob-haircut-trends-2026"">bob haircut</a>. Lopping off five inches became something of a metaphor for shedding the past and starting afresh. Ever since then, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/kicked-bob-haircut-trend"">the bob</a> has been my hairstyle <em>du jour</em>. </p>



<p>I’ve rocked the “bottleneck” bob (so named for its face-framing fringe), the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/08/11073768/italian-bob-haircut-trend"">Italian bob</a> (characterized by volume and chunky, blunt ends), and even the “boyfriend” bob (arguably the shortest — and, surprisingly, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/bob-haircut-short-hair-hatred"">most controversial</a> — of the bunch). But last June, as I grappled with the flatiron (bobs are high maintenance, you know), I decided on a new hair goal: to grow my hair long and strong so that I didn’t have to put as much heat on it, or style it constantly.</p>



<p>It grew at a snail’s pace. No matter how many spiky silicone head massagers I collected, or how enthusiastically my beauty editor peers recommended biotin supplements (more on why I chose not to heed their advice later), my hair wouldn’t pass my shoulders for what felt like forever.</p>



<p>In a bid to find out what was going on, I reached out to various hair experts, even paying a visit to the <a href=""https://www.philipkingsley.co.uk/clinics/london-clinic"">Philip Kingsley Trichological Clinic</a> for a hair scan with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/hair-care-growth-myths-advice"">trichologist Anabel Kingsley</a>. What I learned transformed my hair-care regime as I knew it, and by December, my hair had grown a little over five inches. Fast-forward two months and my friends, family, and colleagues can’t get over how quickly and effortlessly my hair seems to have sprouted.</p>



<p>I won’t gatekeep. This is everything the professionals taught me about growing longer, stronger, and healthier hair — and how to apply it to your own routine.</p>

<h2>I wash my hair more often</h2>



<p>Unsurprisingly, the TikTok-viral concept of “<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hair-training-tiktok-trend"">hair training</a>” — leaving your hair longer in between washes in the hope that your scalp produces less oil over time — is unfounded. Previously, I’d wash my hair once or twice a week, thinking that stretching out my wash days would preserve the integrity of my strands. But the trichologists I spoke to hinted that I was probably doing more harm to my growth cycle than good. </p>



<p>In fact, not washing my hair regularly enough resulted in seborrheic dermatitis, an inflammatory condition that makes <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-grow-hair-faster-natural-oils"">the scalp</a> itchy and results in yellow, sticky flakes. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-glycolic-acid-scalp-treatment-dandruff"">Like dandruff</a>, seborrheic dermatitis is caused by a common yeast called malassezia, and while this yeast is entirely normal, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/greasy-oily-hair-after-washing"">an oily environment</a> causes it to multiply and wreak havoc on the scalp. “As seborrheic dermatitis causes an imbalance, the hair can shed more quickly as it doesn’t have the best growing conditions,” says <a href=""https://www.ukhairconsultants.com/"">Eva Proudman</a>, a consultant trichologist. She explains that hair washing is more about cleansing the scalp — which is simply an extension of the face — than just the hair. “The scalp has 180,000 oil glands, and these can, at different times in our lives, become more active and produce more oil,” says Proudman, hence the propensity for scalp imbalance. She continues, “The scalp is the growing medium of the hair and needs to be balanced for optimum hair growth and hair health.” </p>



<p>Trichologist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/anabel_kingsley/?hl=en"">Anabel Kingsley</a> agrees. She told me previously: “The flaking of the scalp increases daily hair fall and impacts the integrity of the cuticle [the outermost layer of the hair strand], causing the growth of weaker hair.” To Kingsley, the scalp is your hair’s “home” and if it’s in bad condition, it’ll impact how your hair grows. </p>



<p>Of course, how often you wash your hair is down to personal preference, but Proudman says that an ideal washing regime is every day or every other day for optimum scalp balance and hair growth conditions. (I opt for the latter.) Those with curly, coily, and kinky hair might want to stretch this to <a href=""https://www.aad.org/public/everyday-care/hair-scalp-care/hair/care-african-american"">once a week</a>.</p>



<h2>I made my scalp the priority</h2>



<p>I thought I knew how to wash my hair, but I was schooled during a <a href=""https://www.philipkingsley.co.uk/treatments"">hair spa treatment</a> at Kingsley’s clinic, where an expert scrubbed my scalp for three minutes. They also focused less on my lengths. Since then, I’ve done the same for every wash, and I’m convinced that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-milky-toner-review"">the exfoliating motion</a> is keeping my flakes at bay. Interestingly, Proudman adds that consistent scalp massage can stimulate blood flow into the hair follicle to support hair growth. </p>



<p>Seeing as I wash my hair more regularly now, I find that one wash is enough. “Double cleansing your hair is generally only needed if you use lots of products or if you have a very oily scalp,” says Proudman. I just use a generous amount of shampoo to create a substantial lather and make sure that my hair is soaking wet first. </p>



<p>While I wash my scalp more regularly now, I avoid <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hair-mask-conditioner-trend"">putting conditioner</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/05/10973767/hair-oiling-tiktok-trend"">hair oils</a> on my roots. Instead, and as suggested by Kingsley, I concentrate these on my mid-lengths and ends, which need the most moisture. Since doing so, I’ve realized that bombarding my scalp with thick products like these was only making it greasier and likely contributed to my flaky and itchy symptoms. Kingsley confirmed my suspicion. “It’s not necessary to put conditioner on roots,” she told me. “It can weigh the hair down, and if it contains oils, it could potentially exacerbate seborrheic dermatitis.” Though this worked for me, all hair types are different. Your roots might be particularly dry and require more moisture in the form of conditioner, masks, oils, and other treatments of your choice. </p>



<h2>I discovered the smartest shampoo</h2>



<p>I’ve always been skeptical about hair growth shampoos. How can something that’s only on your scalp for a few minutes at a time possibly have an impact on your strands? Happily, I was proven wrong when <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.typebea.com%2F"">I discovered </a><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.typebea.com%2F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.typebea.com%2F"">Typebea</a>. Anna Lahey (founder of supplement brand <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.vidaglow.com%2F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Vida Glow</a>) and Rita Ora (yes, really) are the brains behind the beauty editor-adored <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.typebea.com%2Fproducts%2Fovernight-boosting-peptide-1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">G1 Overnight Boosting Peptide Serum</a>, and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.typebea.com%2Fproducts%2Fstrength-length-shampoo"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">G2 Strength &amp; Length Shampoo, $26</a>, and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.typebea.com%2Fproducts%2Fstrength-length-conditioner-1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Conditioner</a>. I’m convinced all three have helped my hair grow longer and stronger. </p>



<p>It’s all in the ingredients. First up is baicapil, which Proudman explains is a plant-based ingredient (a combination of wheat sprouts and soybean) and is often used in hair products. Lahey reports that it’s clinically proven to boost growth and reduce hair loss by 60%. There are a small handful of studies that suggest baicapil is an <a href=""https://www.opastpublishers.com/open-access-articles/a-study-to-evaluate-the-efficacy-of-baicapil-formulations-in-treatment-of-telogen-effluvium.pdf"">effective hair growth treatment</a>. According to Lahey, baicapil has the power to improve hair density, strengthen follicles, and enhance scalp health, resulting in thicker, more resilient lengths over time. </p>



<p>Then there’s salicylic acid. “This gently exfoliates the scalp, removing dead skin cells, product, and oil buildup, and balancing oil production,” says Lahey. Proudman adds that salicylic acid keeps the hair follicles clear, which supports healthy hair growth. Lastly, the shampoo and scalp serum boast provitamin B5, aka panthenol, to moisturize the hair and keep that moisture under lock and key. Proudman says that provitamin B5 also “smooths the hair to give a good shine and protection from damage”. </p>



<p>All of these ingredients have been studied and can provide benefits to the hair and scalp, continues Proudman, but she adds that it’s important to note that the formulation — and amount of these ingredients — determines how effective a product will be. In my honest opinion, as a beauty director who has tried my fair share of hair growth products, Typebea’s are the only ones that have worked for me. When I rinse away the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.typebea.com%2Fproducts%2Fstrength-length-shampoo"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Strength &amp; Length Shampoo</a> and wring out the water, it’s like it has worked magic to beef up my strands. Not only is my hair longer, but it feels twice as thick. I’ve been through a handful of bottles of the shampoo and conditioner in particular — and I’m already stocking up on more. </p>





<h2>I used minoxidil — but consistency is key</h2>



<p>If you’re still skeptical about hair growth shampoos and serums, and you’re experiencing hair loss or thinning in particular, you might want to consider trying minoxidil: a proven treatment for androgenetic alopecia (hair loss caused by a combination of genetics and hormones). “Minoxidil is a vasodilator that pulls blood flow into the hair follicle,” explains Proudman. “It stimulates the hair follicles to enter into the growing phase and remain there for longer.” Minoxidil also increases the diameter of the hair, says Proudman, improving overall hair density on the scalp. </p>



<p>For full disclosure, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FWomen-s-Rogaine-5-Minoxidil-Foam-Unscented-2-Month-Supply%2F38695500%3FclassType%3DREGULAR%26athbdg%3DL1200"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">I used Rogaine</a> (an over-the-counter version of minoxidil) every day for three weeks last August, concentrating the product to a sparse patch on my left temple. But consistency is key. “It can take three to six months to see the effects of minoxidil,” says Proudman, “and it needs to be applied to the scalp, not the hair, consistently as advised.” </p>



<p>When I discovered Typebea, I shelved the minoxidil after a few weeks to see if the serum, shampoo, and conditioner would do anything. While that sparse patch is more or less unchanged, the length elsewhere is impressive. It’s important to note that while Typebea claims that its four-step system can reduce hair fall — how often your hair falls out on its own naturally — it doesn’t tackle hair loss. </p>



<p>Minoxidil also has a few potential side effects. “The most common can be scalp irritation, slight lowering of blood pressure, and an increase in heart rate,” says Proudman. In some cases, it can trigger more hair to shed as your hair enters the growing phase, continues Proudman, and this is likely to last for around four to six weeks.</p>



<h2>I stopped going to sleep with wet hair</h2>



<p>A dermatologist told me recently that hair is at its weakest point when wet, which encourages breakage. For that reason, I now always whip my hair up after washing it into a microfibre towel like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mykitsch.com%2Fproducts%2Fmicrofiber-hair-towel-micro-dot"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kitsch Microfibre Hair Towel Wrap</a>, which I’m convinced is gentler on my strands, and I rough-dry my hair before bed rather than letting it dry naturally overnight. I like to use a speedy, lightweight hairdryer like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fshark-beauty-speedstyle-pro-flex-P513831"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shark SpeedStyle Pro FLEX Professional Performance High-Velocity Hair Dryer System</a>.</p>



<p>I also learned to brush my hair properly. “Get in the habit of brushing your hair from the ends,” Kingsley told me. She added that if you tend to start at the top or mid-lengths, you’re putting lots of tension on your strands — a fast track to breakage. When my hair is wet, I use a wide-tooth comb like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fca%2Fen%2Fproduct%2Fmane-knot-ur-avg-wide-tooth-hair-comb-P510149%3FskuId%3D2745198%26icid2%3Dproducts%2520grid%3Ap510149%3Aproduct"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mane Knot Ur Avg Wide-Tooth Hair Comb</a>, and when it’s dry, I use a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fca%2Fen%2Fproduct%2Fpattern-beauty-by-tracee-ellis-ross-paddle-brush-P504841%3FskuId%3D2654440%26icid2%3Dproducts%2520grid%3Ap504841%3Aproduct"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">paddle brush</a>, which brushes comfortably and doesn’t ever tug.   </p>





<h2>I avoided pointless supplements</h2>



<p>Proudman told R29 that a poor diet and low levels of vitamins and minerals such as ferritin, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and zinc may cause both hair shedding and slow growth. A blood test showed that I was deficient in vitamin D, and now I take a supplement. Besides vitamin D, you’ve likely heard that biotin, or vitamin B7, can encourage better hair growth. But here’s the thing: You might not actually need it.</p>



<p><a href=""https://www.cots-tri.co.uk/"">Sally-Anne Tarver</a>, a trichologist at <a href=""https://www.cots-tri.co.uk/"">the Cotswold Trichology Center</a>, previously told R29 that biotin supplements are only likely to work for people who have a deficiency. She said that such a deficiency is very rare in the Western world. “Simply stuffing [in] more biotin if you don’t need it will not result in healthier hair growth,” said Tarver. What it could do, though, is provide incorrect blood test results and even lead to hormonal issues. </p>
