Built by hand using ancestral techniques, the villa draws from the vernacular forms of rural Morocco, merging local know-how with an environmentally conscious approach to design. Its irregular rhythm, tactile surfaces, and sculptural volumes blend seamlessly into the surrounding terrain, giving the impression that the house has grown organically from the land itself.</p>",

<p>Infrastructure has long defined the backbone of cities by linking people, landscapes, and economies through systems that often go unnoticed until they fail. Today, as global challenges demand more adaptive and human-centered responses, architects are rethinking what infrastructure can be: not just a framework for movement and utility, but a catalyst for ecological restoration, cultural continuity, and civic imagination. The following unbuilt projects, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/contact"">submitted by the ArchDaily community,</a> explore this expanded role of infrastructure, where airports, bridges, industrial parks, and pedestrian networks become architectural expressions of connection and care.</p>",

<p>In early 2023, LUXELAKES planned to launch a new project in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/wuhan"">Wuhan</a>. Having collaborated on multiple previous projects—such as Dotsss Children's Museum, Edenland Architectural, and CPI Planning in Chengdu, as well as The CAPE Commercial District and Qilou Historic Street Planning in Hainan—we were already familiar with each other and worked together seamlessly. As a result, we collaborated again to design a restaurant within a children's playground. During the preliminary planning phase, the restaurant was named ""The Brave Cabin,"" as it was surrounded by challenging recreational climbing equipment. We hoped the building would inspire children's courage to overcome difficulties. With an indoor area of less than 200 square meters, the building has a relatively small footprint. Our goal was to create ample semi-outdoor spaces where visitors could relax in the shade. Additionally, thanks to its prominent location at the island's gateway, the building is visible from a distance to arriving visitors.</p>",

<h4>Seven design insights from taking Grammarly ads (too) seriously.</h4><figure><img alt=""A collage of pastel rectangles with exclamation marks, with a bold wavy line snaking between them like through a labyrinth."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*69TJE9nfEYpzRhienCAVzQ.png"" /><figcaption>Writing your way or pushing writing out of the way? Image by the author.</figcaption></figure><p>Three weeks ago, YouTube finally decided that I must be interested in writing. Fair enough: I’m a Human-Computer Interaction professor researching writing tools and the impact of AI. Soon, my feed filled with Grammarly ads — and I started reflecting on their curious messages.</p><p><strong>What if we took AI writing tool ads seriously<em>?</em></strong></p><p>Ads may seem an odd source for design reflection. Yet they are highly intentional design artefacts because they are expensive and compete for attention. They are forced to distil a design’s essential features and choose concrete values to highlight. This makes them spotlights on how a design wants to be seen and understood.</p><p>The key insight from my anecdotal ad-vestigation:</p><blockquote>As portrayed in their ads, these AI tools address people who don’t value writing for its intellectual or creative demands, and thus miss its opportunities for growth.</blockquote><p>In response, I outline seven design insights and questions to inspire alternative directions for your next (AI) writing tool design. They are organised into two parts: concepts and use cases.</p><h3>Concepts of human-AI interaction in writing tools</h3><p>The ads reveal several recurring themes in how human–AI interaction is framed within writing tools.</p><figure><img alt=""A collage of four Grammarly promotional images showcasing different AI tools. The visuals feature clean gradients and text about features such as “AI writing app,” “Paraphraser agent,” “Proofreader agent,” and “Humanizer agent.” Each image includes the Grammarly logo and brief taglines about improving writing clarity, tone, and efficiency."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g7rgjWiThQCmy0xCPrmu2A.png"" /><figcaption>Examples of the analysed ads. Image created from screenshots by the author.</figcaption></figure><h4>Interaction paradigm: What exactly is an agent?</h4><p>Some ads present Grammarly as an <em>app, </em>others as an <em>agent</em>. Interestingly, in both cases, they depict a toolbar or sidebar UI element. The only ad that shows a chat does not<em> </em>use the word <em>agent, </em>although chatting feels more characteristic of an agent than toolbars. This leaves open how Grammarly itself understands and operationalises “agent-ness”, at least in the ads I encountered.</p><p><strong>Questions for your design: </strong>Which interaction design, offering which (AI) capabilities, would make your system an <em>agent </em>rather than a <em>tool</em>, from a user’s perspective? And how does that serve your design goals?</p><h4>Task delegation: Avoiding writing with AI</h4><p>Mandy ads emphasise the appeal of delegating writing tasks to AI to save time and effort. Examples include slogans like <em>“Your work-life balance just got more manageable”</em> and <em>“Sound natural and polished without extra effort”</em>. One ad even promotes a <em>“Humanizer agent” </em>to <em>“Eliminate robotic phrasing”.</em> This likely targets those disappointed by past results with AI. Another ad mentions an <em>“AI lineup”</em>, implying delegation of writing to multiple agents<em>.</em></p><blockquote>Across these examples, the ads frame writing as labour to be avoided. As someone with a deep interest in writing, this does not speak to me at all.</blockquote><p><strong>Alternative design direction: </strong>How might we design tools that let writers delegate the tasks that <em>distract </em>from writing, rather than writing itself?</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of a Grammarly ad featuring the text “Start your best draft with this AI lineup” on a blurred background resembling a writing app. A blue paper plane icon and vertical toolbar with Grammarly-style icons appear on the right. The Grammarly logo is at the top center. The caption below reads: “Your best work deserves a powerful stage — Sponsored · Grammarly.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/624/1*-QvSZ83HsNf9Ow_r_KvHFg.png"" /><figcaption>An ad implying delegation of writing to a “lineup” of AI. Screenshot by the author.</figcaption></figure><h4>Writing stages: AI wants to help everywhere</h4><p>Several ads stress the user’s involvement through phrases that highlight “your” contribution. Examples include <em>“keeping ownership of your ideas”</em>, “<em>make your voice resonate with readers”, “Your best work deserves a powerful stage”, </em>and <em>“See specific ways to strengthen your essay”. </em>Across idea, voice, work, and essay, these ads imply that AI will assist at any stage of writing.</p><blockquote>Together, these ads position AI as always present, with no clear roles or boundaries. This might be less appealing to expert writers who know their workflows well.</blockquote><p><strong>Alternative design direction: </strong>What if we made it a deliberate design goal to constrain AI to a specific role, rather than letting it do everything? And how might we empower writers to shape the scope of AI functionality and its integration into UIs and workflows themselves?</p><h4>Cognitive processes: Typing but not writing</h4><p>One ad promised to <em>“Get Effective, Mistake-Free Writing Every Time You Type”. </em>This framing turns the user into a receiver of writing from an unspecified source, implied to be AI. The user is not entirely passive, though: They still “type” — but they do not “write”. This is a key difference. In the <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1177/0741088312451260"">cognitive process model of writing</a>, typing aligns with the <em>transcriber</em>, the most mechanical of the three processes. The other two are <em>proposer </em>(generating ideas) and <em>translator </em>(expressing them in words). The ad’s message thus assumes users who prefer to avoid the more creative efforts of writing.</p><p><strong>Alternative design direction: </strong>How might we design (AI) writing tools that help users actively explore their own ideas and expression, instead of passively receiving prefabricated language from the system?</p><h3>Use cases for AI writing tools</h3><p>The ads primarily target two audiences: students and professionals. Moreover, ideation appears as a third use case across both groups.</p><h4>Ideation — without exploration</h4><p>Several ads promise help with finding ideas at the start of a writing project. Examples include <em>“Say goodbye to blank-page scaries and jump-start ideas faster”</em>, “<em>Start your best draft with this AI lineup”, </em>and <em>“Jump-Start Ideas With Grammarly’s AI Brainstorming Features”. </em>The latter ad shows a brainstorming button that generates high-level essay content for a user-provided topic. I like that it offers possible directions without dictating details. However, the feature’s UI design limits exploration and iteration. It is crammed into a chatbox pop-up with no space and editing capabilities to compare or iterate on ideas.</p><blockquote>As shown in the ad, users are expected to immediately copy an AI-provided idea. This workflow seems unlikely to appeal to people who enjoy exploring many ideas before committing one to the page.</blockquote><p><strong>Alternative design direction: </strong>How might we design for a closer integration of ideation and writing? Of canvas and page? What if the AI’s role were to facilitate transitions between these processes, or to provide a substrate for exploration and iteration, rather than simply generating text to copy?</p><h4>Communication: Is AI polish all you need?</h4><p>Another group of ads focuses on writing as communication, such as <em>“Put your best foot forward”</em>, <em>“Send the right message”</em>, <em>“Get heads nodding on your first email instead of your fifth”</em>, and <em>“Communicate clearly, come across as you intend, and strengthen work relationships”</em>. Fittingly, these ads feature people rather than interfaces, highlighting the promise that AI will help the user be perceived positively.</p><figure><img alt=""A Grammarly ad showing a person with a beard looking focused while sitting indoors, with natural light and a plant in the background. White text on the image reads, “Send the right message.” The caption below says, “Get heads nodding on your first email instead of your fifth — Sponsored · Grammarly.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/624/1*XFKqMo4OwGzrTIQpnclPCw.png"" /><figcaption>An ad targeting the use case of writing for communication. Screenshot by the author.</figcaption></figure><p>However, the opposite can also be true: When a message is perceived as AI-generated, it can <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3491102.3517731"">decrease trust</a>. It remains unclear how the design mitigates these risks. The existence of a <em>“Humanizer Agent”</em> in another ad supports this: Why design features that require the user to also “humanize” the text?</p><p><strong>Alternative design direction: </strong>How might we design tools with a nuanced understanding of the social nature of writing in focus, rather than assuming that AI polish is all you need?</p><h4>Learning: Grades over growth</h4><p>Grammarly’s YouTube <a href=""https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfPYYNRetSN_cKgkv3vFk6A2Felr9_kfb&amp;si=KW1ZOhNwXRLSi_0X"">playlist</a> for students focuses on performance markers. Its slogans include <em>“Work faster and smarter”</em>, <em>“Make the grade”</em>, <em>“Submit high-quality work for school”</em>, and <em>“Craft your success story”</em>. The last one features a time-travel plot in which a student learns that <em>“everyone’s using it”,</em> and joining in will turn him into a CEO later in life. As an educator, I find this focus troublesome because the ads never portray students motivated by genuine learning.</p><p>Identifying this as the best marketing strategy for a writing tool may reveal more about cultural views of education than about the tool itself. A behind-the-scenes video titled <em>“How to succeed in school” </em>makes this even clearer:<em> </em>It interviews actors from the ads, who give personal advice such as <em>“don’t take it so seriously”</em> and <em>“people put too much emphasis on studying”</em>.</p><figure><img alt=""A frame from Grammarly’s YouTube video titled “How to Succeed in School | Behind the Scenes at Grammarly’s ‘Back to School’ Shoot.” It shows a person with long blonde hair, dressed in black, sitting on a gray chair and speaking to the camera.

Image arranged from screenshots by the author; additional caption added by the author.</figcaption></figure><p>In contrast, the ad <em>“Edit Essays Faster” </em>shows a degree of introspection through interaction with AI. A student reflects on edit suggestions: <em>“That’s true. This is much better. You know, I didn’t know my writing contained so many run-on sentences until I started using Grammarly.”</em></p><figure><img alt=""A frame from a Grammarly YouTube video showing a person with short dark hair wearing a green plaid shirt, sitting with a laptop in a bright, modern space. On the left, a Grammarly interface pop-up displays a clarity suggestion that reads, “Your sentence may be unclear or hard to follow.

Yet those demands offer opportunities for thinking, expression, personal insight, and skill development. I suspect this mismatch is a part of why AI tools can miss the mark with writers.</p><p>If we read ads as reflections of underlying design assumptions, they tell us something about tool design itself, not merely marketing strategy. This view motivated the questions above, pointing to alternative design directions.</p><p>Nevertheless, there’s a difference between how a tool is advertised and how it can be leveraged. In this spirit, and as a small experiment, I edited this article with Grammarly. I had a good experience with it in this limited role. I even liked some of the constraints of the free account: It marked sentences for me to revisit, yet hid the AI suggestions. I like to think that this prompted my own thinking. Some features, like “expert reviews”, also seem designed to generate questions rather than only answers. More broadly, I’m curious to see upcoming updates, from <a href=""https://www.grammarly.com/blog/company/introducing-new-superhuman/"">acquiring Superhuman</a> to proactive agents, and how these will be advertised — and to whom.</p><h3>Resources</h3><p>These references provide further reading on the mentioned concepts and suggested design directions:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3491102.3517731"">Perceptions of AI in email writing</a> and in other <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3613904.3641955"">interpersonal communication</a></li><li><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3698061.3726924"">Creativity support tools designed for more than productivity</a> and for <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3586183.3606831"">empowering writers</a></li><li><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3690712.3690725"">What if AI tools were designed to center writers’ own creative decisions?</a></li><li><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1177/0741088312451260"">The cognitive process model of writing</a> and the <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3581641.3584060"">role of AI suggestions therein</a></li><li><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3706598.3714119"">Combining canvas and page UIs for writing with AI features</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=1bab97d0fa98"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-ai-writing-tools-fail-to-speak-to-writers-1bab97d0fa98"">How AI writing tools fail to speak to writers</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Frankenstein’s monster, depicted as a tall, gaunt figure with visible stitching on his face, looks out with a sad expression from a dark, wooded area."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/830/1*ZtbNbfYdlfBWQeYHno2B5A.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Endpaper illustration for the 1983 Marvel Comics adaptation of <em>Frankenstein</em>, by Bernie Wrightson.</figcaption></figure><p>I was reading <em>Frankenstein</em> to my son last week (as one does in the days leading up to Halloween). As he fell asleep, I was struck by a thought. The <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2025/08/14/move-fast-and-break-things-as-strategy-tech-experts-takes/"">“move fast and break things” ethos</a> of the last two decades in tech is remarkably similar to the core themes of the 200+ y/o Shelley classic. The story of a creator obsessed with his own genius, blind to the consequences, who unleashes a powerful, uncontrolled creation into the world and then abdicates all responsibility for the harm it causes? An apt comparison, indeed.</p><p>Victor Frankenstein’s great folly lay <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/mit-press-scholarship-online/book/20711"">not in his ambition, but in his abdication</a>. Horrified that he “had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch,” he ran. He left his creation to be feared and misunderstood by a society that was not prepared for it.</p><p>This is the dilemma of the modern tech profession. We, the architects of the digital commons, have acted with the same hubris. We build systems optimized for profit and engagement, unleash them upon society, and then hide behind a structure of <a href=""https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/psychology/diffusion-responsibility"">diffused responsibility</a> when systemic harms emerge (<a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crl8d0x9lpdo"">teen mental health crisis</a>, <a href=""https://digitalchew.com/2025/10/21/are-tech-companies-fueling-political-division-in-the-u-s/"">political polarization</a>, <a href=""https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-psychiatry/article/technological-addictions-the-new-frontier-in-addiction-psychiatry/4160D1D48CD08BBC4AE03DEA90B6B9CE?utm_campaign=shareaholic&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_source=bookmark"">mass addiction</a>, <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/10/18/how-americans-view-data-privacy/"">erosion of privacy</a>).</p><p>Which brings me to another idea that occurred around the same time: “Terms of Service.” No, I’m not talking about the little box you check, having not read the thousands of words of dense, technical jargon. That is a symptom of the disease.</p><p>I’m talking about flipping this very concept on its head- an enforceable “Terms of Service” pledge to be taken by tech professionals (myself included, as a UX and brand strategist): an <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532770/"">oath</a> to address “Frankenstein’s dilemma” and finally take responsibility for our (co)creation.</p><h4><strong>From Open Commons to Unregulated Market</strong></h4><p>This call to action is made urgent by the industry’s own evolution. The ethos of the early internet was rooted in the promise of a decentralized, open commons: a <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/06/science/joichi-ito-innovating-by-the-seat-of-our-pants.html#:~:text=The%20Internet%2C%20on%20the%20other,groups%20at%20its%20%E2%80%9Cedges.%E2%80%9D"">“freedom to connect, to innovate, to program, without asking permission.”</a></p><figure><img alt=""A retro pixel-art graphic from an old operating system, showing a “Dialing Progress” window.

IYKYK. <strong>Image Credit:</strong> blockchaincompound.com</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, that ethos has been superseded. The commons has been enclosed and commercialized. Today’s dominant platforms are not public utilities but engines of monetization, driven by an <a href=""https://public.summaries.com/files/1-page-summary/the-attention-economy.pdf"">attention economy</a> that treats human focus as its primary resource.</p><p>In his book <strong><em>Technofeudalism, </em></strong>Yanis Varoufakis describes how</p><blockquote>“cloud capitalists… have mutated into something far grander: techno-lords presiding over cloud fiefs and accumulating a new form of rent- cloud rent-extracted from a new class of serf: the cloud serf.”</blockquote><p>The fundamental change in purpose- from a tool for communication to a system for extraction- is precisely why the field is overdue for an ethical overhaul.</p><h4><strong>Precedents for Accountability</strong></h4><p>This is not the first “wild west” in professional history…</p><p>Imagine you are a stonemason in ancient Greece, struck by a fever that will not break. You seek help in the agora, but the marketplace of “healers” is a chaotic spectacle.</p><p>One man offers a poultice of herbs mixed with magical charms. Another, a priest, insists your illness is a divine punishment and demands a sacrifice. A third offers a potion, but you’ve heard whispers that some such men are not above accepting payment to administer poison. Who do you trust with your life when there is no standard to distinguish a healer from a charlatan? This was the reality of the “medical profession” in Greece, circa the 5th century BCE.</p><p>Enter the <a href=""https://absn.northeastern.edu/blog/the-history-of-the-hippocratic-oath/"">Hippocratic Oath</a>: a radical intervention with a practical purpose and a lasting impact. A group of practitioners set themselves apart with a binding commitment to “abstain from whatever is deleterious and mischievous” and to act in the patient’s best interest, forging a pact of trust with a public desperate for it.</p><figure><img alt=""A close-up profile view of a Greek bust of Asclepius, the god of medicine, shown next to the Rod of Asclepius, which is a staff with a single snake coiled around it."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lNzULoQpd59brIvH3QbnMQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Asclepius, the Greek god of medicine. <strong>Image Credit:</strong> Inspired Pencil</figcaption></figure><p>Centuries later, other professions forged their own pacts. <a href=""https://ironring.ca/background-en/"">The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer</a>, along with the conferral of an Iron Ring, was born from the 1907 Quebec Bridge collapse, which killed 75 workers due to design flaws. While the legend that the first rings were made from the bridge’s wreckage is an embellishment, its endurance speaks to the profession’s embrace of a foundational lesson in humility. Similarly, the legal and financial professions bind practitioners as <a href=""https://scholarship.law.ua.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1034&amp;context=fac_articles"">‘officers of the court’</a> or with a <a href=""https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/fiduciary-duty"">‘fiduciary duty’</a>, a legal standard obligating them to act in their client’s best interest, not their firm’s.</p><p>In all cases, these oaths provide a higher authority to which the professional must answer, overriding the demands of a boss or a project budget. The tech industry, while relatively nascent, operates as a great exception.</p><p>Built on what Harvard Professor Shoshana Zuboff defines as</p><blockquote>“the unilateral claiming of private human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data,”</blockquote><p>our current model of “surveillance capitalism”(Zuboff) is not an inevitable result of technology, but a specific <a href=""https://www.oru.se/contentassets/981966a3fa6346a8a06b0175b544e494/zuboff-2019.pdf"">“economic creation”</a> that has thrived in secrecy and <a href=""https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/after-the-digital-tornado/caveat-usor-surveillance-capitalism-as-epistemic-inequality/9EB949FA5BD07CF448C7D8F6A226B975"">in the absence of law and regulation</a>.</p><p>The resultant system of unchecked growth without accountability now translates into our crisis of governance. Our informational reality and civic lives are predominately ruled by algorithms optimized not for truth, but for profit. In this economy, polarizing content is the most engaging and therefore the most profitable. Research confirmed that when Facebook’s algorithm (optimized for user engagement) was changed to boost posts with high emotional reactions, it <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2023/07/27/1190383104/new-study-shows-just-how-facebooks-algorithm-shapes-conservative-and-liberal-bub"">“inadvertently promoted toxic and anger-inducing content.”</a></p><figure><img alt=""A close-up photograph of the aged, paper label on an amber pharmaceutical bottle. The label is typed with the word “THALIDOMIDE” and “NDA Sample”."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*DJVnPF15uQRJ8m9pyqM_qw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>The thalidomide disaster marked a necessary turning point for the pharmaceutical industry. <strong>Image credit:</strong> The New York Times</figcaption></figure><p>Many compare the tech landscape to a “pre-reckoning” Big Tobacco. A more useful comparison, however, might be the pharmaceutical industry. After the <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3573415/"">thalidomide disaster </a>of the 1960s caused thousands of birth defects, governments began requiring “substantial evidence” of a drug’s safety and efficacy before it reaches the public.</p><p>We do not knowingly allow drug companies to “move fast and break things” with public health. Yet with technology, we continually do. Corporations treat multi-billion-dollar fines as a fractional “cost of doing business.” In 2023, the five largest tech firms were fined a combined $3.04 billion. They earned enough revenue to pay that entire sum in <a href=""https://proton.me/blog/big-tech-2023-fines-vs-revenue"">just over seven days</a>.</p><h4><strong>The Architecture of Diffused Responsibility</strong></h4><p>The modern tech company is a marvel of <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07935"">diffused responsibility,</a> a psychological phenomenon where individuals in a group feel less personal accountability. The UX designer optimizes for engagement. The engineer for stability. The product manager for growth. No single person can be held responsible for the systemic harms that emerge.</p><p>This is the system’s genius: it scales profit and impact while atomizing responsibility.</p><figure><img alt=""The popular “Spider-Man pointing” meme, showing three identical Spider-Man characters standing in a circle and pointing accusingly at each other."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TVpZX_q_jLQYFXkSx9sTag.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Actual depiction of designers, engineers, and product managers when asked, ‘Who is responsible for the rollout of this harmful feature?’ <strong>Image credit:</strong> Marvel Entertainment / From the 1967 <em>Spider-Man</em> animated series, episode “Double Identity”… meme-ified.</figcaption></figure><p>A new oath, therefore, cannot be a passive pledge. It must be an active, professional tool that empowers the practitioner to fight this diffusion. It must grant tech workers the formal standing to ask questions, the right to see data, and the power to refuse; not as a malcontent, but as a professional upholding their code.</p><p>Consider the designer asked to create a notification system using intermittent variable rewards (<a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brain-wise/201311/use-unpredictable-rewards-to-keep-behavior-going"">the same mechanism as a slot machine</a>) to maximize engagement. Ethical UX design principles dictate that a practitioner must <a href=""https://uxpa.org/uxpa-code-of-professional-conduct/"">“do no harm”</a> and put the <a href=""https://app.uxcel.com/tutorials/ethical-principles-for-creating-responsible-and-user-focused-ux-design-582#:~:text=UX%20design%20ethics%20means%20making,users%20have%20with%20your%20product."">user’s needs first</a>, but it would require something closer to a “Mandate of Inquiry” to fully empower the designer to ask: “Have we researched the potential impact of this on teen anxiety? Can I see that data before proceeding?” Under a protected oath, the designer is no longer a troublesome employee, but a professional upholding a standard.</p><p>It is crucial to distinguish such a framework as a set of <em>enforceable rights</em>, not as another aspirational pledge. The landscape is littered with <a href=""https://mkdale.github.io/techoath/"">“feel-good” oaths</a> and top-down corporate principles published by the very <a href=""https://ai.google/principles/"">companies causing harm</a>. These top-down models are ultimately toothless because they disempower the individual. They are tools for <a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_4864"">legal compliance</a> and public relations, not for the practitioner in the “engine room.”</p><p>Even our most evolved professional codes, such as those from the Association for Computing Machinery (<a href=""https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics/software-engineering-code"">ACM</a>), are largely silent on the employer-employee power dynamic. They are excellent at describing a practitioner’s duty- to <a href=""https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics/software-engineering-code"">prioritize the public good</a>, to <a href=""https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics"">“avoid harm”</a>, and to “<a href=""https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics"">challenge unethical rules</a>,” but they provide no tool or protection to do so against a conflicting order from management.</p><p>In other words, they tell the engineer to wave a flag at the runaway train, but offer no way to stop it. The practitioner who follows this duty is often the one who gets steamrolled, fired as a “dissenting employee” with <a href=""https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/conscientious-objectors-in-the-workplace-98913/"">little recourse</a>.</p><p>The following Mandates, therefore, propose a fundamental shift: from a passive duty to an active <a href=""https://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/negotiating-tech/governance-of-workplace-technology-applications/work-task-technologies-and-applications/control-ownership-and-protection-of-personal-and-professional-autonomy/"">power</a>. They are designed to arm the practitioner for that inevitable moment of conflict. While as yet imperfect and conceptual, they are intended to spark necessary conversation about what a framework of enforceable and protected ethics must look like, and how we, as a profession, can begin to implement it.</p><figure><img alt=""A symbolic image of a human hand shaking a glowing, blue, wireframe digital hand over a desk with a laptop on it."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1bCvg4YQsa9Jljd6vYQEhQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>A symbolic handshake represents the “Architect’s Mandate,” a proposed formal pact between a tech professional and the systems they build, ensuring rights and accountability. <strong>Image credit:</strong> Unsplash</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>The Architect’s Mandate: A Proposed Code</strong></h4><p>A functional oath for a tech professional would be less a pledge and more a formal declaration of professional obligations:</p><p><strong>I. The Mandate of Inquiry</strong></p><p>I shall have the protected right to ask “Why?”; to perform a root cause analysis on the intent behind the features I am asked to build. I will not be satisfied with metrics of “engagement” as a substitute for human value.</p><ul><li>This mandate is a direct antidote to the “architecture of diffused responsibility”. While existing codes suggest practitioners should <a href=""https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf"">“reflect upon the wider impacts of their work”</a> or <a href=""https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/initiatives/great-tech-great-responsibility/addressing-ethical-issues-tech-worker/"">“talk across teams”</a>, this provides a formal, protected right to demand answers and data, piercing the veil of organizational siloing.</li></ul><p><strong>II. The Mandate of Consequence</strong></p><p>I shall have the right to access any and all research on the likely human impact of my work before it is deployed. I pledge to place the long-term well-being of the user above the short-term metrics of the platform.</p><ul><li>This right is a novel mechanism for accountability. While human rights organizations often <a href=""https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/content/where-human-rights-and-engineering-meet"">partner with engineers to analyze data</a> and ethical frameworks discuss organizational <a href=""https://iabac.org/blog/ethical-data-engineering-the-challenges-of-responsible-data-handling"">“transparency”</a>, no code grants the individual practitioner an affirmative right to access internal impact research before a product’s release.</li></ul><p><strong>III. The Mandate of Refusal</strong></p><p>I shall not be compelled to design, build, or deploy systems that I believe, in my professional judgment, are designed to exploit human vulnerabilities, erode agency or privacy, or amplify division. I will have the protected right to refuse such work without fear of retaliation.</p><ul><li>This mandate radically expands the existing “right to refuse” work. Current legal protections are almost exclusively limited to situations of “imminent danger” of “death or serious injury”. This proposes a new, professional standard of refusable psycho-social harm, and demands explicit <a href=""https://www.eeoc.gov/facts-about-retaliation"">protection from retaliation</a> for what amounts to secular, professional <a href=""https://www.westsoundworkforce.com/conscientious-objection-in-the-workplace/"">“conscientious objection”</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>IV. The Mandate of Precedence</strong></p><p>I pledge to hold my duty to the public- their safety, their agency, and their mental well-being- as paramount, above my duty to my employer’s stock price or my project’s quarterly goals.</p><ul><li>This is the foundational principle of all mature professional codes. The National Society of Professional Engineers, for example, states that the <a href=""https://www.nspe.org/sites/default/files/Ber97-5-app.pdf"">“highest ethical obligation is to protect the public health and safety”</a>. This mandate affirms that this established principle must finally be applied to the digital world.</li></ul><p><strong>V. The Mandate of Testimony</strong></p><p>I shall have the protected right to bear witness to systemic public harm caused by a product I helped create, even after its release. My professional duty to warn the public shall supersede any non-disclosure agreement or corporate policy, and I shall not be subject to retribution for this testimony.</p><ul><li>This is a potent synthesis of legal and ethical precedent. It argues that a tech professional’s <a href=""https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/communication-and-mass-media/duty-warn"">“duty to warn”</a> the public of danger, a duty that supersedes confidentiality in <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK542236/"">medicine</a> and <a href=""https://www.nspe.org/career-growth/ethics/board-ethical-review-cases/signing-confidentiality-agreement-duty-disclose"">traditional engineering</a>- must also supersede a non-disclosure agreement or policy. While <a href=""https://www.whistleblowers.org/non-disclosure-agreements-and-whistleblowers/"">whistleblower laws</a> already protect reporting of <em>illegal</em> activity and courts can compel testimony, this mandate seeks to extend that protection to testimony regarding <em>systemic public harm</em> that is not yet explicitly illegal.</li></ul><p><strong>VI. The Mandate of Audit</strong></p><p>I shall have the protected right to audit the data sets and models I am asked to use before deployment. I will have the right to test for, document, and mitigate algorithmic bias, even if it conflicts with a project’s timeline or stated goals.</p><ul><li>This mandate targets a well-documented harm: AI systems that perpetuate and amplify societal biases. An algorithm is often <a href=""https://www.proskauer.com/podcast/ai-bias-audits"">“only as good as the data that was used to train [it]”</a>. While some laws require top-down corporate <a href=""https://www.brookings.edu/articles/auditing-employment-algorithms-for-discrimination/"">“bias audits”</a>, this mandate grants the right to the practitioner, empowering them to test models and retrain or suspend biased algorithms as a matter of professional practice.</li></ul><p><strong>VII. The Mandate of Sustainable Design</strong></p><p>I shall have the protected right to refuse work that I believe, in my professional judgment, intentionally implements planned obsolescence or demonstrably contributes to environmental degradation.</p><ul><li>The tech industry is a massive contributor to e-waste and environmental harm, often by design (a <a href=""https://www.iberdrola.com/sustainability/planned-obsolescence"">“deliberate industrial strategy”</a>). This mandate extends the “right to refuse” beyond immediate human danger to include systemic environmental danger, empowering engineers to advocate for sustainable <a href=""https://www.computer.org/press-room/2016-news/code-of-ethics"">“green” engineering principles</a> and refuse to participate in practices they know to be destructive.</li></ul><p>The framework outlined here is not a plea for rebellion. If the “move fast and break things” era was marked by a defiant, adolescent, Frankenstein-esque hubris, this proposal is (conversely) a declaration of industry maturation. It is our chance to act on what Frankenstein only briefly glimpsed long after abandoning his creation, when he confessed,</p><blockquote>“For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were…”</blockquote><p>A codified set of principles, with the ultimate goal of legal enactment, is what separates a collection of atomized employees from a unified profession. A single person can be <a href=""https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/conscientious-objectors-in-the-workplace-98913/"">fired</a>; a profession with a shared, legally-enforceable code of conduct has power.</p><p>We are not at the mercy of an unregulated “tech monster” beyond our control. We are its architects and gatekeepers. This is the moment we stop abdicating and choose to fulfill the duties of a creator.</p><p>This is the blueprint. It is time to take ownership.</p><p><em>I invite a public critique of these mandates from all professionals in the field.

<h3>How to nail onboarding — a case study of Runna</h3><h4>Lessons in clarity, confidence and community</h4><p>Nearly <a href=""https://www.runna.com/en-gb/strava-acquires-runna"">1 billion runs</a> were recorded on Strava in 2024.</p><p>Targeting runners is a <em>big</em> market.</p><p>And it’s a market that’s growing — according to <a href=""https://www.runna.com/en-gb/strava-acquires-runna"">Strava</a>, running was the ‘fastest growing sport globally’ with ‘Gen Z turning to running to create community and connection’.</p><p>Which is the <strong>winning strategy</strong> for coaching app <a href=""https://www.runna.com/"">Runna</a>.</p><p>If you run, you’ve probably heard of Runna. The consumer app is<em> all over</em> Instagram, TikTok, and Strava, with 48,000+ ratings at 4.9 stars on the app store. The <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/runna/"">Reddit community</a> alone now has around <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/runna/"">47,000 members</a>.</p><p>Officially launching in March 2022, Runna reached <a href=""https://www.standard.co.uk/news/tech/strava-acquires-popular-runna-app-b1222946.html"">7,000 paying subscribers</a> a year later and has since helped <a href=""https://www.runna.com/en-gb/strava-acquires-runna"">millions of runners complete their first race</a>.</p><p>In April 2025, Runna was acquired by Stava for an unknown amount. Though <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/seb-johnson_strava-runna-crowdfunding-activity-7324024883418382336-xTC2?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACEru7kB8-Anzw-Z0Ee3-GIgCyW6sGkmrp0"">estimates</a> are around £150 million, based on a 30X return to early crowdfunding investors, who invested when it was valued at £5 million (30 X £5M = £150M).</p><p>That’s when I decided to see what all the hype was about.</p><p>The acquisition caught my eye, and so did the fact that my friends had just signed me up for a half-marathon 🫠 As a Strava paying subscriber, I got the email about a Strava × Runna bundle, it made sense to give it a go.</p><p>And this is that story: <strong>my journey through Runna’s incredible onboarding.</strong></p><p>We’ll see three big lessons across the onboarding flow, covering:</p><ul><li>Why most product marketing tests fail to have an impact, but Runna’s packs a punch</li><li>Where user-generated content and community can come into onboarding</li><li>How certain industries need a longer onboarding process</li></ul><p>By the end we’ll see that there’s nothing flashy about Runna’s onboarding. It just makes you believe you can actually <strong>do it.</strong></p><p>We’ll also see just how well I ran according to my plan 👀</p><p>Let’s jump straight into lesson one, starting from the first thing we see: a welcome screen carousel.</p><h3>Lesson 1) Show your product clearly</h3><p>Most apps try to look impressive. Runna just tries to make sense.</p><p>When I open the app on my phone for the first time, I see an onboarding carousel which looks slightly old-school, but I love it.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*puktDueirGzA1V4APH4rLw.png"" /></figure><p>The classic saying is that ‘no one reads an onboarding carousel’.</p><p>Which, in my experience is <strong><em>half true.</em></strong></p><p>Studies have shown users don’t have time to read: most people read <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-little-do-users-read/"">28% of the words on a page; 20% is more likely</a>.</p><p><em>However, </em>I’ve added a carousel before a paywall before and it <em>improved</em> conversion to trial. So there’s something to be said for adding extra context for customers.</p><p>In my view, Runna’s carousel works here. It does three things really well:</p><ul><li>It runs through screens like an Instagram story (no tapping required)</li><li>There’s very few words (max 9 in each headline)</li><li>Imagery does the heavy lifting</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tM4tOfgJx7KE-v_icAgRAw.png"" /></figure><p>The Instagram-style story creates a <strong>variable reward</strong> 🧠 as you don’t know what’s coming next. It also follows a common consumer app <strong>mental model</strong> which works well in this context.</p><p>What stands out here is the <strong>imagery. </strong>From the second carousel screenshot, it’s clear to me what a ‘personalized running plan’ might look like.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/499/1*7qWurLh6N8_B45Bv4qJEOA.png"" /></figure><p>As someone who gets injured all the time and has no real game plan for running, this structure, clarity and format made me sigh with relief.</p><p>It created a mini-magic-moment for me early on.</p><p>On the fourth screenshot, my running injuries came to life:</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/499/1*VQ2LUfE70GJusdfKNW-u9w.png"" /></figure><p>Runna has used the most common running injury (Achilles Tendinitis) as an example, with micro copy:</p><ul><li>Get back to running quickly and carefully</li><li>Returning to running post-injury</li></ul><p>They know that this is one of the biggest fears, frustrations, or anxieties that holds people back from running. Whether it’s past injuries or future injuries, with these images, Runna is signalling:</p><blockquote>We’ve got you</blockquote><p>Does this impact conversion? Hard to say. My gut says no.</p><p>In my experience, I’ve rarely seen adding imagery into onboarding improve conversion.</p><p>That’s because it’s<strong> really hard to do well.</strong> You need to have excellent image designers and really think about what will make people have a lightbulb moment. Imagery needs to be:</p><ul><li>Easy to scan, easy to see</li><li>Use specific, real examples</li><li>Be able to be understood in a moment’s glance</li></ul><p>That’s a tough order.</p><h3>Lesson 2) Bring your marketing inside your product</h3><p>Runna’s onboarding starts long before download. Its community and content seep straight into the product journey.</p><p>The first obvious thing I noticed is the authentic lifestyle imagery and social proof throughout the flow.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5n9jr3CzhOEc7aiLPyEktQ.png"" /></figure><p>After the carousel, I see a load of smiling women and men I want to be friends with sitting on a park bench.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/499/1*DvwkS7kpHdoUDI7J1U0WBg.png"" /></figure><p>Further into onboarding, after I select the run I’m doing, I see 230 other little avatars ready to run with me.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1023/1*LOg_JV9KEuFVRq41hmpqPg.png"" /></figure><p>There are little signals of value add here too:</p><ul><li>Date</li><li>Location</li><li>Run type = flat (thank god)</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/499/1*wm1VAYBXUyTxYs3kAjXI6w.png"" /></figure><p>Before this onboarding flow, I hadn’t checked the run route for the run I’d booked.</p><p>With these details (flat ‘elevation of 34 meters’ &amp; ‘230 others running’), the app has calmed some anxieties around being fit enough for hills and showed me other’s are doing it too. Quietly reassuring me:</p><blockquote>You got this</blockquote><p>And it continues…</p><p>At the end of onboarding, I see more runners 👀</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YYOQw1UL4xBai1_8GeXp5w.png"" /></figure><p>Notice how the human imagery varies:</p><ul><li>Full screen vs. small avatars vs. videos</li><li>Stylised shoots, vs ‘taken on the run’ vibes</li><li>Background gradient fade or spotlight image</li></ul><p>What’s curious is that these touch points are littered throughout. There are 30 screens I see in onboarding before I see my plan on the homepage.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*J3X4-NZI_xa3b0Sf1xD3DA.png"" /><figcaption>Too many to show…</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s a summary (as I know the above image is too small 🥴):</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4PRtTKhECrLY6nme_4v-BA.png"" /></figure><p>In terms of where the imagery sits, there’s imagery beginning, middle (almost) and end of onboarding. With a big cluster near the paywall.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZAcO9G_OXxNKMnYNtNc8ew.png"" /></figure><p>What I see here: a product direction that<strong> knows community is important.</strong> And an onboarding funnel that matches the acquisition funnel (influencer marketing, user-generated content in ads, reddit communities).</p><p>Whilst hard to execute, I’ve heard of experiments showing that matching ad creative and copy at the top of the funnel to the product journey, from onboarding to homepage, can improve conversion to paid and retention.</p><h3>Lesson 3) Design for confidence, not speed</h3><p>Everyone has fears.</p><p>My fears are around running (and the dark).</p><p>The key doubts on my mind coming into this were:</p><ul><li>Can I run this run I’ve booked?</li><li>Will my old injuries resurface?</li><li>Will I get new injuries?</li><li>Will I get faster? Can I run under 2 hours?</li><li>Can I fit this into my work week?</li><li>Will this app work with my garmin and strava set up?</li></ul><p>By the end of my 12-minute-long onboarding, <strong>I’m clear on all of the above.</strong> And honestly, I felt pretty relaxed about it all.</p><p>The hard part of testing onboarding is balancing two things:</p><ol><li>The macro steps (getting you set up, called ‘set up tasks’)</li><li>The micro details that aren’t crucial, but subconsciously push people along.</li></ol><p>On 1. it’s incredibly hard to prioritise what to put in onboarding. As a rule of thumb, if it positively impacts retention (i.e. when people take [product action] we see they retain better) then AB test it in onboarding to see if it’s a causal relationship, not just a correlation.</p><p>On 2, it’s even harder to make decisions of what small details to add. What micro copy will calm users, what images can help.</p><p>Individual, isolated tests rarely reach significance on these things. And if you’re not close to the customer, you can end up just adding words, steps and noise that get in the way.</p><p>For Runna, the macro steps are:</p><ul><li>Set a goal</li><li>Pick a race</li><li>Self select your running ability</li><li>What days would you like to run?</li><li>Predict your running time</li><li>Pick km/mi</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JjhBVSRr0-X7G7LFa3ho1Q.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*I1lhv5RHBbl39pfasKIVXw.png"" /></figure><p>From the copy on these steps, my anxieties around fitting the plan into my week, running a good pace and ‘will I be ready’ for my half marathon are covered.</p><p>Then it’s the micro details that add confidence. If I pick a 5k time that’s too fast, it tells me the app isn’t built for me.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tUtqzyLnTVHxJ331tvHseA.png"" /></figure><p>Which reinforces that I am in the right place, because I cannot run that fast (but I hope to one day).</p><p>The post-onboarding plan introduction takes the level of confidence one step further, with:</p><ul><li>Estimated race times</li><li>A guide to the four run types (with a coach video explainer for each)</li><li>The first of those workouts reflected in my plan (starting with an easy run, yay)</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zNKuHeM-Nmnap_J2VBUhTQ.png"" /></figure><p>The estimated times show me what I can achieve with and without the app:</p><ul><li>Without Runna: 1hr 59</li><li>With Runna: 8 minutes faster (1hr 51)</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/499/1*QwN9Bx5EWYFs__WJnbE2vg.png"" /></figure><p>Again imagery being used here to show value at a glance.</p><p>Lastly, the copy on ‘Types of run’ guides is just so simple.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HsjiGLuHHfonj-q2q5hsvQ.png"" /></figure><blockquote>‘The purpose of these runs is to recover and freshen up’</blockquote><p>No jargon, no running-speak. None of that elite language that puts people off.</p><p>Just plain old english. And again, none of it feels optimised. It’s just plain and simple.</p><p>Bish bash bosh.</p><h3>The summary: confidence is what Runna is optimizing for.</h3><p>By the time I finished onboarding, I hadn’t even started training but already felt more confident about the race.</p><p>Thinking back over this flow, the funny thing is that it isn’t particularly <em>sexy</em>. Runna doesn’t try to impress me.</p><p>Instead, every choice — from unhurried pacing to clear copy — signals that this app is serious about getting you to your goal.</p><p>It feels like the restraint on product sexiness or pazazz, and the focus on plain and simple, is what earns trust.</p><p>The irony is that this onboarding doesn’t just onboard you into an app. It onboards you into <strong>believing you can actually run the thing.</strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=7780ba89c202"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-nail-onboarding-a-case-study-of-runna-7780ba89c202"">How to nail onboarding — a case study of Runna</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Inset is the little baby redwood tree I planted in my backyard.</figcaption></figure><p>Time is money. Move fast and break things. Crunch time. We hear these idioms repeated, and to many, they become true. You can live your life by these sayings if you like.</p><p>I prefer:</p><blockquote>“Time is a fluid condition which has no existence except in the momentary avatars of individual people. — Virginia Woolf”</blockquote><p>Woolf seemed to recognize the spectrum on which time exists — its fluidity. Importantly, that time centers around humanity, because we track it. We frame it in terms of its past, present, and future. We observe its passage.</p><p>My preference doesn’t mean I don’t need a calendar. I desperately do. But some days I wish I didn’t. :) Time is something I’ve been thinking about quite a bit these days. As AI seems to be moving quite quickly, my children have grown into near-adults, and as I age, things seem to be moving faster. They’re not, but they seem to be.</p><p>If you’ve ever been in a car accident, time seems to slow down, while spending time with good friends can seem to move quickly. Temporal perception should feel familiar to everyone. There are numerous papers on this topic; <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03196844"">this one</a> provides a good breakdown, but <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-H4MKJSRXs"">this video</a> by David Eagleman is less dense. Eagleman experiments with time and proves that time doesn’t slow down, but your memory, triggered by your amygdala, captures the novelty of traumatic events “to attend to the situation at hand.” Memories are created in a kind of second memory system that you may need in the future to avoid or deal with the trauma at hand. So your brain has more memories to draw from, and you perceive time as elongating. Neuroscience is neat. Watch the video; his explanation is better than mine.</p><p>Depending on where you grew up, your cultural understanding of time may also differ.</p><p><em>“In general, Monochronic cultures view time as linear and separable, capable of being divided into units, and therefore emphasize doing ‘one thing at a time’. In contrast, Polychronic cultures view time as naturally recurring, and therefore emphasize doing ‘many things at one time.” Nonis, Teng, Ford 2005</em></p><p>The above definition is based on <em>Edward T. Hall’s 1959 book, The Silent Language. </em>Even though these binary stereotypes aren’t universal, studies support the assertion that place plays a role in how you perceive time, despite the difficulty in measuring these differences and their dependencies on context. (<a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273382690_Cross-cultural_Perspectives_on_Time"">Fulmer, Crosby, and Gelfand — 2014)</a></p><p>One context is the work you do. Your job affects your sense of time. I imagine that Paramedics and Quarterbacks likely think in <strong>seconds and minutes</strong>. If a patient goes into cardiac arrest, there seems to be an immediacy of action that other jobs lack.</p><p>The technology people that I’ve spent my career with…Product Managers and Software Developers, think in terms of <strong>weeks, sprints, and quarters.</strong> Our planning cycles contain deadlines, iterations, and launches. Even the CEO’s I’ve worked with often keep their time scales in shorter cycles as the technology can change quickly.</p><p>Urban Planners and Architects think in longer terms — <strong>years and decades.</strong> The scale of the work they do requires more time, and therefore, they have longer-term perspectives. The new Eastern span of the Bay Bridge in the SF Bay area took over a decade to complete and several years in planning since the impetus was the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.</p><p>Few people think in <strong>centuries or millennia</strong>, but among them are Historians, Archaeologists, and Climate Scientists. Problems like the Climate Crisis, which affect us all, suggest that humanity has to step away from the numerous constructs that have affected the way we think about time and collectively shift to thinking more long-term. <br /> <br />This conclusion led me to wonder how many people I knew take a long-term view, and the answer was very few. Then I thought of Alexander Rose, who has spent his career thinking about the long-term.</p><p>I met Rose at Burning Man in 1999. His part of our camp was called Antarctica. He’d brought an 18-wheeler freezer truck out to the desert, and the idea was to crank up the air conditioning, have a DJ play music, and serve hot chocolate in this mobile club. It was delightful. He’d joined the Long Now Foundation in 1997 and worked there till 2024. He’s Director Emeritus at the Foundation and continues to consult on the Clock project, but he’s currently the Director of Long-term Futures at <a href=""https://automattic.com/"">Automattic</a>. That’s almost 30 years where his efforts had been focused entirely on long-term thinking, AND doing so by engaging in or starting <a href=""https://longnow.org/projects/"">numerous projects</a>. The <strong>Rosetta Project,</strong> for instance, is a global collaboration of language specialists and native speakers working to build a publicly accessible digital library of human languages. <strong>The Manual for Civilization</strong> is a set of 3500 books that would help restart civilization (in case things go awry). I’ve attended numerous talks at the events they set up, and visited the Interval, a lovely bar they built that serves as both a place for drinks and a community space.</p><p>All of these projects are impressive individually, but together they form a collective to support the idea that we humans need to think about the long-term.</p><p>Among these projects is <strong>The Clock of the Long Now</strong>. What is that? Well, it’s a clock designed to function for 10,000 years (or more) that is, “An immense mechanical monument, installed in a mountain, designed to keep accurate time for the next ten millennia. The 10,000-year clock is hundreds of feet tall, engineered to require minimal maintenance, and powered by mechanical energy harvested from sunlight.” Its purpose? The official answer is: “The Clock provides a rare invitation to think and engineer at the timescale of civilization. It offers an enduring symbol of our personal connection to the distant future.”</p><figure><img alt=""This is the face of the Clock of the Long-Now.

Credit: Rolfe Horn, courtesy of the Long Now Foundation <a href=""https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/the-clock-of-the-long-now/"">https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/the-clock-of-the-long-now/</a></p><p>It reminds me to take a longer view of things. Not all things, of course, but for those things that require long-term thinking, the clock<em> </em>is a persistent reminder that some things take a long time. Like the Redwoods I planted in my backyard — inset pictured above.</p><p>Also, it’s arguably the equivalent in terms of human achievement to Stonehenge or the Pyramids. <strong>Wow!</strong> <br /> <br /> I reached out and had a lovely conversation with Rose.</p><p><strong>Dave: </strong>Tell me about your background.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> I grew up on the Sausalito waterfront in what was literally a junkyard with a bunch of hippies and artists. I grew up building things and basically wanted to be an inventor, but inventor schools don’t exist, so I thought Architecture was the way to go. I realized it wasn’t for me, and found Industrial Design at Carnegie Mellon. It’s one of the oldest programs in the country, and when I joined, I was very much looking forward to it being hands-on. When I started, they’d hired a new Dean who was very much into rhetoric, so after arguing with him on a relatively constant basis, he bumped me forward a year, and my degree took three years. I graduated in 1994. Afterwards, I moved back to the Bay Area and worked for LucasArts and Chrysler.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Me too. I also have an Industrial Design degree, but started working on web stuff when I moved to the Bay Area. What got you into the Long Now work?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> I had been through a few cycles of the game development, and the days were long, but then we’d ship, and then nothing. They don’t need you at all, like a movie production. So I reached out to Stewart Brand, whom I knew growing up, and he told me about the conversations he was having around Long-term Thinking. That we’re living in a world that has long-term consequences like climate change, hunger, education…you name it…but our mechanisms aren’t set up to handle them. Strangely, benevolent dictators do this better, but those are few and far between.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Super few of those on the benevolent front, yeah. :)</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Yes, and Democracy, with its four-year election cycle, is particularly bad at this. How do you incentivize lawmakers to care about something 20 years from now when they won’t get the credit for it? Stewart introduced me to Danny Hillis, who started Thinking Machines…</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> I worked for Brewster Kahle, who worked for Danny!</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Right, so that’s how you ended up with our mutual friend at Burning Man in ‘99.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> That’s right. :)</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> So Danny Hillis is a computer scientist out of MIT, and he wrote an article for Wired in 1995. In it, he outlined his <a href=""https://www.wired.com/1995/12/the-millennium-clock/"">idea for the clock</a>. He and a number of people had been cooking up the Long Now Foundation through the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Business_Network"">Global Business Network</a>. Steward set me up with several interviews, one that eventually led to the game company Blizzard, and the other was with his own newly founded project, Long Now. Even though the gaming industry offered more money, I really liked the idea of a 10000-year clock. I joined in 1997.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> I know the Long Now Foundation has worked on a bunch of things, and not just the clock, but can you give me a brief background on the clock?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> We built the first prototype that we took to TED. It debuted on New Year’s Eve 2000 in the Presidio at the Internet Archive offices, and then we shipped it to the <a href=""https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co531554/first-prototype-of-the-clock-of-the-long-now-1999"">Science Museum in London</a>. Then we built two more, one at the Interval in San Francisco and one for Nathan Myhrvold. I’d met Jeff Bezos at TED after he funded another one of our projects called Long Bets in 2001, and then he and Danny became friends. He was scouting sites for Blue Origin and came to our Nevada site for the clock, and we hiked together, and we all became friends. Bezos offered to fund the full-scale clock at a site he had in Texas, as the site we were looking to use in Nevada had several environmental challenges around access and elevation. Concurrently, many other projects were happening at Long Now. The Rosetta project, The Interval I mentioned, all the talks we’ve had. So now, we’re close to finishing many aspects of the clock, and I realized I didn’t want to administer a non-profit or raise money for the rest of my life. So I started doing research into how to hand off this first generation of work and create something multi-generational.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> I read the <a href=""https://longnow.org/clock/faq/"">2024 Hillis FAQ</a> on the Clock. Where are you now?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Well, everything is installed. The clock is made up of modules stacked up 500 feet high, and while each module worked, we hadn’t had the whole thing assembled, so that’s what’s happening now. There are still some details to be dealt with, which we will hopefully be able to talk about soon.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Hillis mentions in the FAQs that it’s a work in progress.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Yeah. There are a couple of things that will be left undone on purpose, but we’ve provided a kind of API, as it were. There are these anniversary chambers that are driven by the clock…an annual, a decade, a century, a millennium, and a ten-millennium one. The first has been commissioned, and we will hopefully do the decade one, but we’ll leave the others for future generations.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> That’s really interesting. I read recently that the best way to think about the future is to establish institutions that will address the future, and yet our current regime is trying to dismantle the future as fast as it can.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> The pendulum of justice usually swings in the right direction. :)</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> The moral arc of the universe…</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> We have these times that are tough to live through for sure, and they can take a very long time, but we hope that’s not the case. We might lose some stuff along the way, and then we’ll have to recreate those things.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> A super smart Designer I know, Bob Baxley says, “Look, they’ll destroy and the younger generation will build,” so he’s got a really hopeful view.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> If there’s one lesson that I got out of Long Now and studying long-term thinking, it’s that the very best way to think long-term is to give more optionality to the future. That you’re trusting the future to have more information on their present than you could project onto them from the past. They are going to make better decisions unless you have taken away their ability to make a decision. If you chop down all the old-growth redwoods, no one ever gets to decide about old-growth redwoods again for a thousand years. This is why the Pace Layers diagram is really good. If you’re chopping down these Redwoods and you’re doing it on the commercial layer. In that case, you’ve skipped Governance and Culture (and of course Nature — SIDE NOTE: If you’re unfamiliar with <a href=""https://longnow.org/ideas/pace-layers/"">Pace Layers</a>, go check it out. Rose drew the diagram we’re all familiar with as an expression of Brands and many others’ thinking.)</p><figure><img alt=""Pace Layers is a diagram that depicts a series of curved lines vertically oriented (almost like a closeup cross -section) with a series of labels from top to bottom showing Fashion (with an additional squiggly line), Commerce, Infrastructure, Governance, Culture, and Nature — each with an arrow moving off to the right."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IiD6hj6_X7FaD7mYaLUcNA.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram of Pace Layers</figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://longnow.org/ideas/pace-layers/"">https://longnow.org/ideas/pace-layers/</a></p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Does trust play a role here?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Absolutely. It’s about trusting the future, but it’s not what’s happening in our legislature right now. The Bill of Rights (the first ten amendments to the US Constitution) is excellent because they’re short. They’re principles to follow, rather than the 1000 pages of laws that no one reads.</p><p>(for example, the First Amendment — Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.)</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> They’re almost memetic representations. It’s a shame that some folks have boiled down the Second Amendment to “Don’t take my guns,” and it’s an easy thing to repeat.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> It’s a good example because they (the founders) should have left it more open to the principle and not about the object — the people should be allowed to defend themselves and leave that open to interpretation because what they didn’t know is that there’d be, you know, ICBMs and tanks. A lot fewer people would be dead.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> That’s true, and that mentality just seems so hopeless. You touched on this a moment ago, but do you think Designers should have hope? For instance, in a hopeless scenario where the clock, situated in Texas, gets lost because Texas becomes a battleground…have you thought about that? Are you hopeful that it gets found again?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> We designed it to be lost and found for sure, both in the way that it keeps time and has power that it can harvest from the temperature difference. It does more things when people are there, but when they’re not there, it conserves that energy of showing you the time and chiming and things like that. Some of the most successful stories of things lasting a long time are things that are lost, like the Dead Sea Scrolls. If they’re not lost, their chances of surviving sometimes go down. We chose its location based on it being far from human populations, so it is out of the path where humans may destroy and rebuild on a regular basis. We also put it where it’s nowhere near minerals that people would find valuable.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> I hope to visit someday. How has your thinking about time generally changed over the course of your career?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> I’m always kind of looking for a long-term angle on just about anything that I work on and that I think about. In some cases, it’s also discerning what doesn’t need to be thought about long-term and what should be ephemeral. Not everything needs to be long-term. Art and fashion need a lot of space to be ephemeral and playful. On the other hand, organizations like the WHO, which have been around for 40–50 years, have just gone through their first modern global pandemic, but they don’t seem to be well-positioned to provide all the data gathered and lessons learned for another one. They seem highly politicized and defunded. It’s sad, too, that the CDC is getting decimated. We’re in a position for the first time where we can share information instantly and broadly, and redundantly. We have the ability to gather data and collect data even when people are locked down, which didn’t happen during the Black Plague.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Or even the 1918 Flu Pandemic.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Right. Neither situation had the means to understand what was going on globally. Even worse, is that we have European numbers on deaths but little information on African lives lost.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Switching gears a bit, can you talk about AI and its potential to help with long-term thinking?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> The first time I remember it coming up was in a digital preservation conference we had back in ’98. It was actually <a href=""https://www.jaronlanier.com/"">Jaron Lanier</a> who said, “You know what would be a great use for AI is basically little agents that exercise boring data. Everyone’s preserving all the video games because they’re fun, but who’s preserving WordPerfect 2.0 and knowing if it’s not working on a current system?”</p><p>I don’t think that AI is going to be as destructive as many think. I think it’s going to cause a lot of differences, but I’m certainly not a big doomsayer about it.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> If we’re engaged with spectral thinking, AI exists on that spectrum. There will be bad actors who do horribly evil things, there’ll be some really, really cool advancements for humanity and society, and everything in between. It will take some jobs and create other jobs. There will be a shift.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> When people started freaking out about AI taking jobs was exactly when AI could start taking journalist jobs. Automation has been taking jobs for a long time…a dishwashing machine in a restaurant took a dishwasher’s job. Dishwashers are like the first robots, but no one cared because doing dishes was a chore, and dishwashers had no agency. But the day that ChatGPT could write an article better than about 75% of writers, the journalists all freaked out, and then they wrote a bunch of articles. When DALL-E came out, I saw real problems coming for the illustration market.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, I teach over at California College of the Arts, and the Illustration Department in particular is very upset about AI. But it’s just one perspective. When <a href=""https://www.pentagram.com/about/paula-scher"">Paula Scher,</a> a Pentagram Partner, is willing to train an AI with an illustration style to generate hundreds of icons for <a href=""http://performance.gov/"">Performance.gov</a>, I appreciate her efforts to embrace the new tools, although she took a lot of shit for it. I think it’s going to be a bit of a roller coaster ride for a while. <br /> <br /> Listen, thanks very much for your time. I realize how valuable it is.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Happy to speak to you. Thanks.</p><p>After we spoke, I dug up the earliest reference to what would become the Long Now Foundation and the clock in an article by Hillis.</p><figure><img alt=""Image of a photo I took of the Wired Scenarios article from Danny Hillis. The quote that is most completely pictured here is: “I plant my acorns knowing that I will never live to harvest the oak. I have hope for the future.” — Hillis (1995)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5tsO1KCEOtjLUx7XkwLrbQ.png"" /><figcaption>Photo of Wired Scenarios from the library of the California College of Arts taken by Dave Hoffer</figcaption></figure><p>Several things struck me:</p><p><strong>Conception</strong><br /> <br />Hillis talks about conceiving of the clock, and he says,</p><blockquote>“My friends who get it all have ideas that focus on a particular aspect of the clock. My engineering friends worry about the power source: solar, water, nuclear, geothermal, diffusion, or tidal? My entrepreneurial friends muse about how to make it financially self-sustaining. My writer friend, <a href=""http://www.well.com/user/sbb/"">Stewart Brand</a>, starts thinking about the organization that will take care of the clock. It’s a Rorschach test — of time. <a href=""http://www.geffen.com/gabriel.html"">Peter Gabriel</a>, the musician, thinks the clock should be alive, like a garden, counting the seasons with short-lived flowers, counting the years with sequoias and bristlecone pines. Artist <a href=""http://www.spies.com/Eno/Enohome.html"">Brian Eno</a> felt it should have a name, so he gave it one: The Clock of the Long Now.”</blockquote><p>That’s a really good list of people to speak with about an endeavor like this.</p><p><strong>Execution</strong></p><p>Hillis talks about what it means to build such a clock and its longevity. Corrosion and power sources were actually less of a concern to him than people, as the real problem. What if, for instance, it lasted 500 years but was lost? Those who found it cared more about the metal that it was made of and scrapped it for parts.</p><blockquote>“In the universe, pure information lives the longest. Bits last.”</blockquote><p>People’s construct of time has lasted a great deal longer than most clocks. It’s the ideas (bits) that last. Hillis is friends with Teller (of Penn and Teller), who suggested that Hillis film a documentary, establish the idea that the clock exists, but never really build it. Teller’s career was built on misdirection, but it’s an interesting take on longevity. Create the idea, not the actual clock.</p><p><strong>Hope</strong></p><p>What struck me the most was how Hillis ended the article:</p><blockquote>“I cannot imagine the future, but I care about it. I know I am a part of a story that starts long before I can remember and continues long beyond when anyone will remember me. I sense that I am alive at a time of important change, and I feel a responsibility to make sure that the change comes out well. I plant my acorns knowing that I will never live to harvest the oaks. I have hope for the future.”</blockquote><p>I’m with Hillis on this. I planted Redwood trees in my backyard, and I know I’ll never live to see them grow huge, but we have to have hope for the future, despite how bleak things look right now. Earlier in the article, Hillis talks about what the future might hold.</p><blockquote>“The end of everything we know. The beginning of something we may never understand.”</blockquote><p>Certainly, no one foresaw the place we’ve arrived at in this, our future. The English expression (misattributed to an ancient Chinese curse) — May you live in interesting times — seems especially significant. <br /> <br /> And yet, I still have hope for the future. I hope you do too.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p>Tse, P.U., Intriligator, J., Rivest, J. <em>et al.</em> Attention and the subjective expansion of time. <em>Perception &amp; Psychophysics</em> <strong>66</strong>, 1171–1189 (2004). <a href=""https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03196844"">https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03196844</a></p><p>Inner Cosmos with David Eagleman — Does time really slow down when you’re in fear for your life?

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940231.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>The holidays have arrived early at Sephora, and by that, we mean that the retailer’s highly anticipated savings event is back for 2025. Whether you’re eyeing the bevy of sparkly gift sets or looking to repurchase your favorite <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nocturnal-polar-night-serum-review"">luxe serum</a>, Sephora’s <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/beauty/savings-event"">Holiday Savings Event</a> is the time to do just that.</p>



<p>Anyone who’s shopped Sephora’s sales before knows the rules, but if you’re new here, this is the run-down: Depending on your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/05/9843677/sephora-beauty-insider-cash-rewards-program-update-2020"">Beauty Insider membership tier</a> (which goes from Insider, VIB, and Rouge, depending on how much you spend annually), you can get <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/beauty/savings-event"">10, 15, or 20% off</a>, respectively. The sale is officially open to the public as of November 4, and <em>all</em> tiers have until November 10 to use the promo code <strong>EVERYTHING</strong> at checkout, which automatically applies the discount according to your membership tier. (Regardless of tier, all Beauty Insider levels can take 30% off all Sephora Collection products from October 31 to November 10, no code needed.) </p>



<p>As with previous years, there’s some fine print to keep in mind as you plan your Sephora haul: Shoppers are limited to two Dyson items (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dyson-hairstyling-tools-worth-it-review"">choose wisely</a>), three <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-flexfusion-styler-review"">Shark Beauty</a> items, three The Ordinary products, and three Nutrafol items per transaction. MAC Cosmetics VIVA GLAM products, in-store services, previous purchases, and gift cards are also not eligible for a discount. But, a <em>major</em> perk of Sephora’s holiday savings event: Snapping up gift sets at a discount.</p>



<p>Now that you have the rules of the road, onto the fun part: Keep scrolling for the most worth-it items to snag during the sale.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/glam-flexstyle-for-straight-to-wavy-hair-in-french-gold-P519274"">Shark Glam™ Hot Tool Air Styling &amp; Drying System</a>, $449</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940138.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>We<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-flexfusion-styler-review""> reviewed Shark’s FlexFusion</a> last year, and it surpassed our expectations with flying colors. This year, we’re eyeing the Glam —Shark’s latest innovation, which includes curling barrels, a smoothing brush, finishing tool, straightener, and a concentrator nozzle to achieve a variety of looks.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/lip-cheat-lip-liner-P433516?skuId=2765618"">Charlotte Tilbury Lip Cheat Lip Liner</a>, $26</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940228.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>Charlotte Tilbury’s iconic Lip Cheat pencils are always a good idea to stock up on — especially if you can nab them at a discount. From the iconic Pillow Talk rosy nude to rich reds, this makeup artist-favorite liner is a lip combo essential.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/patrick-ta-major-headlines-cream-powder-blush-duo-P458747"">Patrick Ta Major Headlines Double-Take Crème &amp; Powder Blush Duo</a>, $38</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940112.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>Celebrity makeup artist Patrick Ta’s blushes are still among Sephora’s bestsellers, and with more shade duos than ever, don’t miss out on restocking (or picking up a fresh shade for fall) at a rare discount.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/glazing-milk-P519160?skuId=2898419"">Rhode Glazing Milk</a>, $32</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940176.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>Rhode entered Sephora doors this year, and you know what that means: All your dewy skincare essentials are available to shop during the Holiday Savings Event for the first time ever. If you can only choose one product, make it the Glazing Milk essence, which is perfect for adding extra hydration as the weather cools down.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/advent-calendar-us-P518496?skuId=2907772"">Sephora Collection Advent Calendar</a>, $55</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940188.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>This blockbuster advent calendar by Sephora Collection is 30% off during the entire duration of the Holiday Savings Event, bringing the price tag down to $38.50. With a value of $163.50 in products, this is a serious steal that we predict won’t stay in stock for long.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/lightwork-vii-the-freedom-makeup-palette-P518415"">Danessa Myricks Beauty LIGHTWORK VII The Freedom Makeup Palette</a>, $128</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940117.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>If we had a beauty crystal ball, we would forecast that this Danessa palette will be quite the hot commodity for holiday makeup looks this season. Create endless dazzling looks using the entire assortment, or pop out each six-pan palette, remove the magnetic logo mirror in the center, and take it on the go.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/P517217"">LORE Disfruta Eau de Parfum</a>, $88</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940102.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>If you love niche, luxury fragrance, here’s a name you’ve probably never heard of — for now. From the brains of Melanie Bender (whose resume includes executive roles at Rhode, Versed, and Merit) and Joe Cloyes and Greg Gonzalez (founders of Youth To The People) comes Lore. The collection of four hyper-sensorial, unique fragrances ranges from fruity with a hint of smoky mezcal (Disfruta, seen here) to <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/lovely-a-little-twisted-eau-de-parfum-P517242?skuId=2888469&amp;icid2=products%20grid:p517242:product"">Lovely And A Little Twisted</a>, a milky rose that’s utterly addictive. Best of all: They all clock in at $88 for a full-size bottle — easily half of comparable designer brands — and are fair game during the sale. </p>



<h2 id=""modal2Title""><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/summer-fridays-the-holiday-trio-set-hot-coco-toasted-marshmallow-lbb-mini-jlm-P518536?skuId=2902054&amp;icid2=products%20grid:p518536:product"">Summer Fridays The Holiday Trio Set</a>, $48</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940179.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>There is stiff competition in the world of tinted lip butters, balms, and treatments — but the Summer Fridays one continues to stand out from its competition time and time again. This cozy set includes two holiday-exclusive flavors (Toasted Marshmallow and Hot Cocoa) alongside a travel-size Jet Lag Mask for skin-quenching hydration.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/big-bitty-setting-spray-superstars-P518405"">ONE/SIZE On ‘Til Dawn Mattifying Waterproof Setting Spray Big &amp; Bitty Duo</a>, $36</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940151.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>Patrick Starrr’s ONE/SIZE setting spray is goated for a reason: Nothing works better to lock in makeup all day long with a soft matte finish. This holiday set is only $2 more than the full-size, but includes a mini for those all-important touchups. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941082.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>It’s been nearly two years since the action planet <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2023"">Mars has orbited Sagittarius</a>, making this year’s comeback memorable. In the midst of several retrogrades (Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), we can rely on Mars in Sagittarius to serve as the energetic light we need to get us through the muddiness of fall <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">from November</a> 4 to December 15.</p>



<p>Let’s be real, Mars in Sagittarius can get a little messy. The reason is that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-zodiac-sign-traits-characteristics"">Sagittarius is an impulsive sign</a> that is super reactive and doesn’t focus on the consequences of their actions. When the action planet Mars is fired up in Sagittarius, it can create a mountain out of a molehill, as the archer’s energy can push limits and fight to prove a point for the sake of their bravado — even if no one is questioning their abilities and knowledge. We must be careful because we could shoot an arrow from our arsenal without considering where it lands (or others can do this to us). The reckless attitude and behavior can intensify existing matters. </p>



<p>Our weapons of choice will be words. Mars in Sagittarius has a tendency not to think before speaking. The condition is called “putting our foot in our mouths.” As you know, hearing the cold, hard truth can be unpleasant, making shooting from the hip the worst possible way to upset others. Being that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-aries-pisces-march-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrograde</a> commences on November 9 and lasts until November 29, we should all take cover from miscommunications and hapless interpretation of sentiments. If we don’t, arguments will intensify since we want to have the last word. PSA: Sometimes we don’t need to send the final zinger to win the battle. There is power and authority in silence when people are popping off. </p>



<p>Debating the past is another core theme of Mars’s current journey in Sagittarius. Our memories are based on our personal feelings, which others might not align with someone else’s — which is okay. We have different experiences as humans and should find a common ground to understand each other. Regardless of how we perceive our past, being around those who nurture our hearts with kindness and aim to understand us is pivotal. So, if anyone begins to gaslight us, we should put them on ice and surround ourselves with loving people. Compassion goes a long way in the next several weeks. </p>



<p>Although the transit of Mars in Sagittarius is a time of action, we may be stuck in the mud. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars’s interaction with the other planets</a> serves up indecision instead of certainty. The harsh aspect Mars makes to Neptune retrograde in Pisces on December 14 will make us unsure about how we want to proceed in relationships, work projects, and the next steps in our lives. The only way to deal with this energy is to be calm and meditate on our plans — even if we have the urge to power through. Stopping to smell the roses offers perspective to assess what is essential and what we desire. Taking the opposite road is the equivalent of trying to make “fetch” happen — the trend from <em>Mean Girls</em> that never caught on.</p>



<p>If we put our darts aside by finding the right ways to express ourselves and proceed with empathy — not just for others, but for ourselves — we can make the best of the situation. In a world full of chaos, we can choose to be good and tender. Perhaps Neptune retrograde will soften up the fierce energy of Mars in Sagittarius — here’s hoping for that! </p>



<h2>Important Dates: </h2>



<p><strong>November 4:</strong> Mars enters Sagittarius, adding boldness and confidence to our aura. <br /><br /><strong>November 4:</strong> Mars in Sagittarius opposes Uranus retrograde in Gemini, bringing breakthroughs to the world and our lives.<br /><br /><strong>November 6:</strong> Mars in Sagittarius sextiles Pluto in Aquarius, intensifying matters due to control issues.<br /><br /><strong>November 12:</strong> Mars and Mercury retrograde in Sagittarius form a conjunction, making us question the direction we are heading in.<br /><br /><strong>November 24:</strong> Mars in Sagittarius squares the Nodes of Destiny, urging us to speak up and take a stand for our beliefs.<br /><br /><strong>December 8:</strong> Mars in Sagittarius creates a fraught aspect with Saturn retrograde in Pisces, pushing us to be pragmatic and realistic.<br /><br /><strong>December 14:</strong> Mars in Sagittarius connects with Neptune retrograde in Pisces, highlighting our uncertainty and confusion. Our vitality and energy will be low, so take it easy.</p>

Fall is finally here, and you know what that means: The holidays are just around the corner. And while it may feel early, that hasn’t deterred brands from releasing some of their big-ticket holiday items. Case in point: Beauty-stuffed <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/unique-advent-calendars"">advent calendars</a>.<br /><br />While these blockbuster sets usually come at a premium price point, that's for a few reasons: They tend to be limited in quantity, feature exquisite packaging, and contain myriad products, including full sizes or limited-edition shades. <br /><br />All that's to say that the beauty-filled advent calendars you'll find here are not only marvelous to <em>ooh</em> and <em>aah</em> at but also provide a surprisingly good value, given the ample contents inside. (Pro tip: Find a buddy to go halfsies with and divide the spoils.) And while advent calendars are inherently an exercise in patience, we won't tell if you open up all the teeny-tiny doors the day it arrives on your doorstep...<br /><br /><em>At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939482.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>November opens with a bang — and a bite. The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">first three days of this month</a> mark the final stretch of Mars in Scorpio, so if you’ve been simmering with ambition, desire, secrets, or strategy… you’re not imagining things. Mars is in its domicile here. It’s potent, precise, and a little bit ruthless. There’s a reason things have felt <em>hot</em> beneath the surface — emotionally, sexually, and globally.  <br /><br />This is a week to notice what you’ve learned during this <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars in Scorpio journey</a> (since early October). Have you confronted your triggers? Decluttered your energy? Spoken your truth in a controlled burn? Or maybe you’ve been holding it all in, trying to perfect your next move… but Mars in Scorpio doesn’t wait forever. The first half of this week is your cosmic green light to finish strong, but be mindful of your intensity. Don’t spiral into obsession, revenge, or paranoia. You’re wiser than that now. </p>



<p>By Tuesday night into Wednesday, Mars says goodbye to Scorpio and enters freedom loving Sagittarius, and suddenly everything feels a little lighter… and a little riskier. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-zodiac-sign-traits-characteristics"">Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter</a>, the planet of expansion, exaggeration, and big-picture dreams. So this Mars in Sag transit (from Nov 4 through late December) gives us energy to believe again. We’re breaking free from emotional stagnancy and burning through limitations. Globally, you’ll see the people speaking out for justice louder than ever, organizing protests, demanding rights, and moving with radical optimism. Individually, it’s time to stretch. Move your body. Hike that mountain. Try that dance class. Say yes to things your cautious self might decline. Just be careful not to say <em>yes</em> to everything, because Mars in Sag is also notorious for burnout. Take big swings… but be sure to rest in between. <br /><br />Then on November 5th, the energy deepens with the Taurus Full Moon. Earth signs take the stage, reminding us to come back to the body, back to the breath, back to the beauty of what’s real. This lunation activates themes around <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2025"">money, security, self-worth, and sensuality</a>. It’s a powerful time to pause and ask yourself: <em>Where am I rushing? Where am I forcing what could simply flow?</em> Taurus teaches us that consistency is magic. That pleasure isn’t earned — it’s our birthright. So yes, you can manifest the bag under this lunation, but don’t forget to enjoy the garden you’ve already built. Put your bare feet in the grass. Make the luxurious meal. Light the candle just because. Taurus wants you to taste life, not just conquer it. </p>



<p>Finally, November 6th brings a double dose of cosmic intensity: Venus enters Scorpio and Uranus retrograde re-enters Taurus. Venus in Scorpio is loyal, laser-focused, and just a <em>little bit</em> obsessed with whatever (or whoever) has its attention. This is not the time for superficial love. We’re craving depth, intimacy, and truth. You’ll feel more sensitive to energy; you’ll pick up on what people <em>don’t</em> say more than what they do. And your own aura? Unmissable. You’re magnetic now. But be careful of testing people or playing mind games. Real ones want honesty, not manipulation. As for Uranus sliding back into Taurus for one final round (until it leaves for good in 2026 — not to return for 80+ years), we’re revisiting the lessons around stability, value, and revolution. What outdated ideas about money, land, pleasure, and the body need to go? What new systems are you ready to build? This is the final stretch — so let’s make it count. <br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, Mars, your planetary ruler, is switching signs this week, and you’re gonna feel it like a gust of wind in your sails. On November 4th, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2023"">Mars enters Sagittarius</a>, activating your expansion zone, and honestly, it’s about time. You’ve been swimming in the deep, emotional waters of Mars in Scorpio for weeks now, digging through shadows and figuring out who’s really down for you and who just likes your fire. But now it’s like the fire returns to <em>you</em>. Mars in Sag wants you to move — mentally, physically, spiritually. It’s giving “book that trip,” “say the bold thing,” “write the damn pitch,” “go back to school,” “start the documentary,” “text your mentor back.” Your world is ready to grow, but first you’ve gotta believe there’s more than the tiny corner you’ve been stuck in. And if you’ve been shrinking yourself to survive? Not anymore. This is a cosmic jailbreak. Freedom is calling, and it wants you to answer.<br /><br />Then we get hit with that Full Moon in Taurus on November 5th, lighting up your money zone — and it’s not subtle. Something you started building financially (or energetically, self-worth-wise) around the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-new-moon-in-taurus-april-2025-meaning-effects"">Taurus New Moon six months ago</a> is coming to a head. Maybe you’re finally seeing the payout from something slow and steady, or maybe you’re realizing where you’ve been undercharging, undervaluing, or underestimating yourself. Either way, this lunation is here to shake you back into confidence — but not without a few questions. Especially because two days later, Uranus retrograde reenters Taurus, like a surprise pop quiz from the Universe: “Have you <em>really</em> changed your money mindset? Or are you still clinging to fear, scarcity, or control?” The bag is trying to get bigger, Aries, but you’ve gotta stop blocking it with old narratives. Let this moon illuminate your next step, and then take it, even if your voice shakes. </p>



<p>And let’s not forget Venus
entering Scorpio on November 6th, because whew, things are getting deep. With
both the Sun and Venus now in your sector of intimacy, power, and merging,
you’re not really in the mood for surface-level anything. You want to feel
held. You want to feel trusted. You want to get to the bottom of it — <em>whatever it is</em>. This could be a magnetic
time for financial partnerships too: loans, collaborations, shared investments,
but make sure it’s a soul yes, not just a shiny one. Emotionally, you might
find yourself craving more than words — you want actions, presence, energy. You
want someone who sees through the mask, even the one you forgot you were
wearing. Let yourself be soft <em>and</em>
smart. Let yourself be all-in — but not at the expense of your boundaries.
You’ve come too far to betray yourself for someone who doesn’t know how to swim
in your depths. </p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, this week starts off like the drumroll before the drop… and the Full Moon in your sign on November 5th? That’s your moment, baby. You’re closing a chapter that began around your birthday season, and even if you didn’t know it, you’ve been building toward this culmination for months. Something about your identity — the way you present, the way you carry yourself, the way you take up space — is breaking through to a new level. You’re releasing versions of yourself that felt safer but smaller. And honestly? You’re no longer available for the role of “reliable one who keeps the peace.” You’re the main character. The muse. The mountain. Don’t be surprised if emotions run high around this lunation: you might cry at random commercials, or suddenly want to chop your hair off, or finally <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025-outfit-inspiration-ideas"">wear the outfit you’ve been saving for “someday.”</a> That someday is now. <br /><br />And just when you think that Full Moon glow is the climax, Uranus retrograde re-enters your sign on November 7th, stirring up the final stretch of your personal revolution. Think back to the shake-ups and glow-ups that started around 2018. Uranus was trying to wake you up from autopilot. Now it’s back for the final rewrites — one last round of “plot twists” that push you closer to the version of you who lives freely, speaks boldly, and doesn’t compromise just to be liked. There might be a reunion or revisit this week, maybe with an old desire, maybe with a person, maybe with a part of you that’s been hiding. Instead of resisting it, ask: What is this moment trying to liberate me from? The future is calling, and it wants <em>you</em>, not your mask. </p>



<p>And then Venus, your planetary ruler, slips into Scorpio on November 6th, straight into your partnership sector, and suddenly, everything feels more intense. You’re magnetizing people like crazy — lovers, collaborators, past situationships you thought were long gone. But this isn’t about nostalgia. Venus in Scorpio is here to show you who’s <em>actually</em> ready to meet you in the depth you crave. Loyalty, sensuality, psychic connection — these are the bare minimum now. If it’s not soul-stirring, why are you entertaining it? This transit might also bring <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/07/202646/money-questions-to-ask-your-romantic-partner"">money talks in relationships</a> or contracts with business partners, and your boundaries will be everything. You’re not here to be agreeable; you’re here to build legacy. Say what you want. Ask for what you need. And let love — the real kind — <em>transform you</em>. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, Mars moves into Sagittarius on November 4th, and suddenly you’re not just craving connection — you’re demanding real partnership. The kind where communication feels electric and aligned, where conversations don’t loop in circles but actually <em>go somewhere</em>. This is happening in your relationship sector, so people might start projecting their stuff onto you, especially since Mars tends to stir tension before it brings clarity. But if you’ve been people-pleasing or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/define-the-relationship-advice"">avoiding the Big Talks</a>, this week might blow that avoidance wide open. You may find yourself blurt-blessing truths in mid-convo like: <em>“Wait…why are we even doing this if we both want different things?”</em> Don’t regret it. You’re setting fires, yes, but they’re the kind that forge something stronger from the ash. Whether in business, love, or friendship, Mars is turning up the heat, and if the flame doesn’t grow <em>with</em> you, you’re allowed to walk away. <br /><br />Then the Full Moon in Taurus on November 5th hits your subconscious sector like a lucid dream you don’t want to forget. This is the realm of endings, solitude, intuition, and rest, so if you’re suddenly feeling emotionally wiped out, it’s not just you being “too sensitive.” It’s your soul saying: <em>Pause. Listen. Heal.</em> This full moon is helping you end an old karmic loop: maybe a self-sabotaging behavior, an internalized fear, or a secret you’ve been carrying for way too long. Add to that Uranus retrograde re-entering Taurus two days later, and you might be up late at night processing dreams, journal prompts, or uncanny synchronicities. Pay attention to what your body is telling you to… your nervous system has been holding a lot. Give it a release. Baths, naps, nature, prayers, poetry, whatever grounds you, do it. This full moon is a gentle but firm push into surrender. </p>



<p>By November 6th, Venus slips into Scorpio and lights up your daily routine zone with an edge of mystery, sensuality, and craving. You’re feeling more tuned in to your habits: what you consume, who you give your energy to, what you do with your hours. And to keep things real, Gemini: some of it has gotten too scattered. Venus in Scorpio isn’t about adding more to your to-do list, it’s about deepening what’s already working and letting the rest fall away. You might also feel more physically in tune with your body, or more aware of who at work is draining your joy. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10751082/should-you-trust-your-gut-instinct"">Trust your gut</a>. This is an ideal time to bring more pleasure into your healing journey: hot yoga, Pilates, music baths, dance breaks between emails, delicious meals you eat <em>slowly</em>. Life isn’t a checklist. Let it become an offering. </p>

<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>There’s power in rest, Cancer, and this week, the stars demand it. The Full Moon in Taurus on November 5 activates your community and dream-vision sector, revealing which collaborations are truly aligned with your soul’s long-term growth, and which have quietly expired. It may feel like a wave of both grief and gratitude floods in as you realize certain friendships, teams, or goals no longer resonate. Let it. This full moon is a mirror: <em>Here’s what you wanted then. Here’s what you’ve outgrown. Here’s what you’re ready to dream next.</em> If you’ve been shouldering too many people’s hopes and expectations, this week calls you back to your own lane. You’re allowed to not answer every text. You’re allowed to unplug. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Mars shifts into Sagittarius on November 4, supercharging your health and daily rhythm zone with fire and pressure. You might feel the urge to finally <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-morning-rituals"">commit to a routine</a>—or finally <em>ditch</em> one that’s been draining your joy. Be mindful of burnout, especially if you’ve been over-giving. Mars here isn’t subtle; it demands action. It wants you to be more discerning with your time and habits, not more productive for productivity’s sake. Trust your body when it asks for different pacing. Then on November 6, Venus enters Scorpio, inviting more sensuality, play, and emotional depth into your creativity and romantic life. Think less “get back on track” and more “build a life where joy is the track.” Start there. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You’re stepping into the spotlight whether you planned to or not, Leo. The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 lights up your career and public reputation, and the impact is tangible. An opportunity you’ve been quietly nurturing may come to fruition—or a chapter may close to make space for one that’s more aligned with who you <em>really</em> are now. You don’t have to be ready to be seen. You just have to <em>show up</em> honestly. And if you’re not being recognized where you’ve been pouring your energy? Take note. This lunation brings revelations around legacy, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/secret-to-happiness-at-work"">work-life balance</a>, and your capacity to lead in ways that feel <em>true</em>, not just impressive. <br /><br />Then Mars enters Sagittarius on November 4 and Venus enters Scorpio on November 6, shifting your axis of expression. Mars fuels your fifth house of passion and selfexpression, pushing you to say what’s been unsaid: on the page, on stage, in love, or in your journal. The fire returns to your belly. Your inner artist is hungry. Let them feast. But with Venus moving into your emotionally intense fourth house, there’s also a longing to retreat, to nurture your inner child, to reconnect with what truly feels like <em>home</em>. Let both parts of you breathe this week—the one who wants to shine, and the one who wants to curl up in softness. You’re both. </p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>This week opens with a sacred pause, Virgo: an invitation to step back and look at the bigger picture. The Full Moon in Taurus on November 5 lands in your ninth house of perspective, expansion, and spiritual philosophy, and it’s whispering: <em>What if it’s not about fixing? What if it’s about trusting?</em> You’ve been growing. Quietly, steadily, deeply. This full moon reveals how far you’ve come and encourages you to release the illusion that you have to have it all figured out before you take the leap. Travel, education, or even a shift in worldview could mark this week. Let curiosity lead you more than control. <br /><br />With Mars entering Sagittarius (your home and roots sector) and Venus moving into your communication zone, your inner and outer voices may clash. Mars in Sagittarius could stir conflict on the home front or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/single-solo-travel-romanticise-life"">make you crave more independence</a> and space than usual. That’s not a betrayal of your people — it’s a call to check in on your nervous system and boundaries. Venus in Scorpio, meanwhile, blesses your words with velvet, and you’re more sensual, intuitive, magnetic. Whether you’re writing, speaking, or just thinking, you’re tapping into a deeper truth. You don’t need to scream to be heard. Whisper your magic. It’ll find who it’s meant for. </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, it’s time to stretch your wings and remember how much more of the world there is for you to touch. With Mars entering Sagittarius on November 4, you might feel a jolt of energy and inspiration in your communication zone — and honestly, it’s about time. You’ve been thinking deeply, maybe even overthinking, but now the cosmos is asking you to speak, write, teach, and share again. Not from a place of performance, but from presence. Your words carry fire now, Libra. Conversations will have more spark, more conviction, more truth. So whether it’s pitching that idea, reaching out to an old friend, or just hitting publish on a post you’ve been second-guessing, Mars says: just go for it. <br /><br />Then just a day later, the Taurus Full Moon on November 5 illuminates your intimacy and legacy sector. And it’s not just a regular full moon: Uranus retrogrades back into Taurus two days later, intensifying whatever emotional or financial storyline is rising. This could be the time where you finally release an old debt — emotional or literal. A truth about what you truly <em>value</em> in deep partnerships might surface. You may feel this in your body too: your throat chakra buzzing, your sensuality heightened, your nervous system needing grounding. Ride the waves, but let go of control. There’s alchemy happening in your shadows. </p>



<p>And with Venus entering Scorpio on November 6, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2025"">your money sector is now infused with magnetism</a>. But not just the “cash flow” kind — I’m talking about a deeper rerooting in your self-worth. This is a great time to review your budget or raise your rates, yes, but it’s also about asking: am I honoring the <em>value</em> of my energy? Of my presence? Venus in Scorpio doesn’t do surface-level abundance. She wants you to get intimate with your desires and become unapologetic about claiming what’s already yours. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, this week Mars, one of your planetary rulers, is leaving your sign after an extended stay that probably felt like a bootcamp for your soul. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">The first few days of November</a> carry this final blast of Martian energy, and it’s intense. You may feel a pressure to prove yourself, make a move, or demand clarity… but before you do, breathe. Mars in your sector of self has been reminding you what it feels like to move with your own instincts, not based on validation or trends, but based on your gut. And now, as it moves into Sagittarius on the 4th, your energy shifts to money, security, and self-worth. Your identity work isn’t over, but now it’s more about how you fund the life you’re building, how you value your energy and time, and how you build confidence through aligned action. There may be unexpected purchases, business ideas, or moments where you finally charge what you’re worth. Don’t rush the pivot… just notice where the fire’s leading you.<br /><br />Then comes the Taurus Full Moon on November 5th, activating your relationship sector — and it’s <em>major</em>. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Some Scorpios could be falling in love</a>, signing a marriage license, or realizing they’ve outgrown a connection they once centered their whole world around. </p>



<p>You might go from <em>“I don’t want love”</em> to <em>“I want a home and a legacy with someone”</em> in 24 hours — or vice versa. The moon is revealing what you truly desire in partnership, and what you’ve been pretending not to want. Maybe you’ve been avoiding intimacy when what you crave most is to be held. Or maybe you’ve been <em>centering a fantasy of love</em>, while forgetting your own name in the process. This moon brings truth, clarity, and release. And with Uranus retrograde re-entering Taurus two days later, that clarity isn’t temporary — it’s evolutionary. Expect twists. Expect breakthroughs. Expect to surprise even yourself. <br /><br />By the time Venus enters your sign on November 6th, you’ll feel a soft but powerful return to self. Mars handed you the blueprint, but Venus wants to show you how to move with grace, magnetism, and self-awareness. This is your glow-up moment. People are watching. You’re becoming more intentional about how you show up in relationships, and how you allow others to show up for you. It’s also a powerful time to attract wealth, romantic attention, and recognition, but only if it aligns with the person you’re becoming, not the one you’ve outgrown. Venus in Scorpio doesn’t play about love, money, or authenticity. This is your cue to romanticize your own life, Scorpio. Not because it’s cute — but because it’s time. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, this is your cue to stretch, breathe deep, and get ready, because Mars enters your sign on November 4th, and your world is about to speed up. The beginning of the week still carries <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">the remnants of Mars in Scorpio</a>, which for the past several weeks has activated your spirituality and solitude sector, pulling you inward, forcing you to look at the patterns you’ve avoided, and making you rest even when you didn’t want to. If you’ve been feeling lowkey exhausted, maybe even emotionally foggy or withdrawn, don’t trip — that was part of your cosmic reset. But now the heat is back.  <br /><br />As Mars returns to your sign, so does your drive, your confidence, your power to initiate, and your sense of momentum. The fog lifts. You’re inspired again. Just don’t try to do everything all at once, as this transit can make you impulsive, even reckless. Channel the fire into focused movement, especially with your body: hiking, dance classes, morning runs, boxing, swimming — anything that grounds the energy. You’re not supposed to go from zero to a hundred. But you <em>are</em> meant to follow the fire that feels real. </p>



<p>Now let’s talk money, worth, and self-sufficiency, because the Taurus Full Moon on November 5th (followed by Uranus’ retrograde in Taurus on the 7th) is lighting up your sector of routine, work, and wellness, and it’s bringing some truth to the surface. Maybe it’s a project finally wrapping up, a contract closing, a health scare resolving, or a realization that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/burnout-at-work-recovery-tips"">your burnout wasn’t just physical</a> — it was emotional. This moon says: what in your everyday life is truly sustainable, and what needs to go? <br /><br />Then, on November 6th, Venus enters Scorpio, diving into your dreams, secrets, and emotional processing zone. It’s like your sensual side turns inward. You might be craving more time alone, not because you’re antisocial, but because you’re finally understanding the beauty of emotional privacy. Old loves may resurface, either literally or energetically. You could find yourself craving intimacy without chaos, longing for depth in your friendships, or even reconnecting with a creative project that once felt too vulnerable to share. Let yourself feel things all the way through. Journal. Make playlists. Cry in the shower. Dream big. This transit is preparing you for the soft launch of a new emotional era — one that doesn’t need to be loud to be real. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the week begins with a quiet hum of closure, as Mars finishes its journey through Scorpio, activating your community and collective impact sector one last time. For the past month, you’ve likely been in your boss mode bag, but not in the “climb-the-ladder-alone” kind of way. You’ve been assessing who’s truly in your corner, who aligns with your vision, and where you may have been playing it small just to fit in. Now, as Mars enters Sagittarius on November 4th, you’re entering a more introspective chapter — your healing sector gets lit, and suddenly all the things you’ve been pushing through rise to the surface. Don’t brush it off this time. If you need to rest, rest. If you need to forgive someone (or yourself), do it without making it a whole performance. This is the time to slow your hustle just enough to make sure your soul is still in the driver’s seat. <br /><br />Then comes the Taurus Full Moon on November 5, and baby, this one’s personal. It activates your pleasure, romance, and creativity zone, and it’s bringing up all the feels. For some Capricorns, this could be a literal climax: a passionate fling turning serious, a creative baby being born, or a truth bomb dropping in matters of the heart. For others, it could feel like a deep craving for joy and softness that you haven’t let yourself feel in a while. Let it in. And with Uranus retrograde re-entering Taurus two days later, don’t be surprised if an old crush, hobby, or dream makes an unexpected reappearance. This energy is like your inner child saying, “Can we please go back to what made us <em>feel</em> alive?” Let yourself feel playful again — not because it’s productive, but because your joy is sacred and revolutionary. </p>



<p>And then we have Venus entering Scorpio on November 6th, which breathes depth and intensity into your friendship and vision sector. This is “ride or die” energy. You might suddenly find yourself drawn to new people who feel like soul family — or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/outgrowing-friendships-as-an-adult"">you may start reevaluating long-time connections</a> that don’t hold the same magic they used to. Creatively, you’re magnetic right now. People are watching you, even if they’re not saying it. Don’t shrink your passion. Venus in Scorpio reminds you that the right people won’t flinch at your intensity; they’ll mirror it back to you with devotion. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, the start of the week hits with a potent shift in momentum: Mars wraps up its journey through Scorpio, which has been activating your career and legacy zone for weeks. Whew. You’ve likely been in hyper-focus mode, trying to solidify your path, prove yourself, or restructure what success even means to you. Maybe you were working overtime, maybe you were silently wondering if all your effort is even being seen. (It is, btw.) But here’s the catch: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars in Scorpio can bring out your most obsessive tendencies</a>. If you’ve been pushing yourself past burnout in the name of excellence, pause. That drive isn’t sustainable if it’s rooted in fear.  <br /><br />On November 4, when Mars enters Sagittarius, the tone shifts completely — now it’s all about community, collective dreaming, and your wider network. You’re being invited to remember you don’t have to build the future alone. This transit wants you to connect, collaborate, and maybe even call up those people you keep meaning to reach out to. You’re most powerful when you remember your ideas are meant to inspire a movement, not live in a vacuum. </p>



<p>Then comes the Full Moon in Taurus on November 5, illuminating your home and emotional security sector. This could bring major revelations around where you live, who you live with, or even what “home” means in this current chapter. Some Aquarians might be finalizing a move, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/family-arguments-toxic"">mending family dynamics</a>, or finally releasing emotional weight that’s been stored deep in the body. If you cry this week, let it happen — there’s medicine in those tears. With Uranus retrograde re-entering Taurus two days later, this isn’t just a random full moon: it’s a wake-up call from the Universe about your nervous system and ancestral patterns. Is the version of “security” you’re clinging to actually nourishing you? Or are you due for a whole new blueprint of what rootedness looks like? <br /><br />And then — boom — on November 6, Venus enters Scorpio, joining the Sun and continuing the deep dive into your career and public reputation zone. You’re magnetizing attention like never before, but not because you’re trying to. It’s the depth, the edge, the truth in your voice… people feel it. This is a powerful time for rebranding, launching something bold, or showing up with raw, authentic power in spaces where you previously felt like an outsider. Just don’t fall into the trap of over-curating your image. Trust that being your whole self is what draws the right opportunities in. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, the week begins with an emotional sigh of release. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars is finishing its time in Scorpio</a>, your sector of expansion, spirituality, and long-distance journeys, and baby… what a ride. These past weeks may have felt like an initiation, one that cracked you open and demanded deeper trust in your intuition — not the watered-down, airy kind, but the kind that whispers <em>“go anyway”</em> when logic says don’t. You’ve been traveling (literally or spiritually) and shedding beliefs that no longer align. And now, on November 4, Mars enters Sagittarius and your career zone, shifting the spotlight to how you show up in the world. Expect things to get louder, faster, and more visible. You’re being asked to own your expertise, pitch the dream project, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/online-job-search"">apply for the thing you thought was too big</a>, and step into your power like you didn’t just spend a month doing inner excavation. You did — and it shows. But be mindful of burnout. Mars in Sag can make you think you’re invincible — <em>you’re not</em>. You’re still water, love. Stay hydrated. Stay soft. <br /><br />Then the Full Moon in Taurus arrives on November 5, lighting up your communication and learning zone. Something you’ve been processing mentally may suddenly drop into your body with clarity. A conversation you’ve been avoiding? A message you’ve been waiting to share? This full moon cracks open your throat chakra and dares you to speak from the heart. Words become spells now, so use them wisely. And with Uranus retrograding back into Taurus just two days later, you’re revisiting how you process, think, and even teach. This week rewires your voice and your mind, anchoring your ethereal wisdom into grounded, practical action. </p>



<p>By November 6, when Venus enters Scorpio, the cosmos brings things full circle. You’re being called deeper into your desires for intimacy, depth, and soul-stirring truth — and not just romantically, but spiritually, intellectually, and even professionally. Your magnetism increases tenfold, but so does your craving for meaningful experiences. You’re not here for surface-level vibes anymore. Whether you’re <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/millennial-travel-trends-google-powerpoint-spreadsheets-planning-travel"">planning an international trip</a>, beginning a new study, or finally sharing the sacred work you’ve kept close to your chest, this transit says: go all in. Trust the path even when it’s foggy. Love yourself through the mystery. You are the ocean, Pisces, and the world is ready for your waves. </p>

<p>If all the viral <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/teddy-blonde-hair-color-trend"">color analysis videos</a> have convinced you that you’re more of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/silver-nails-manicure-trend-ideas"">silver gal</a> (but you still want the luxe durability that gold provides), white gold is the cool-toned twist you need to own. Best of all, brands have designed just as many options in white gold as they have in the metal’s yellow-gold counterpart, including classic small and large hoops, as well as textured and bubbled designs.</p>

<h2>Chunky Gold Hoop Earrings</h2>

<p>Thick gold hoops balance boldness with timeless appeal. Some retain a sleek and sculptural feel, while others lean into a chunky and puffy silhouette. Either way, they effortlessly elevate everything from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/copenhagen-fashion-week-fall-winter-2025-street-style"">minimalist outfits</a> to<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cardigan-sweaters""> cozy cardigans</a>. And sure, bigger can certainly be better, but that doesn’t always mean more expensive — these styles all come in under $150.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Large Gold Hoop Earrings </h2>

<p>Make a statement with a pair of go-to large gold hoops. How big you go in circumference is up to you, of course. An oversized pair made from a single thin wire is a classic, while others feature sculptural details begging for a double-take. Continuous circles and open-ended backs both bring just the right amount of drama to everything from a black turtleneck to a tailored blazer — and require little other jewelry. </p>

<p>For a good chunk of the late ‘90s and 2000s, it would be rare to see twins Tia and Tamera Mowry without each other. For many Black millennial women like me who grew up with  <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/06/157426/sister-sister-reboot-tia-tamara-mowry""><em>Sister, Sister</em></a><em> </em>and <a href=""https://www.disneyplus.com/browse/entity-3aa9e7b5-c02e-45db-a8dc-88e9e3a04a11""><em>Twitches</em></a>, Tia and Tamera embodied what we’re talking about when we say “representation matters”: on<em> Sister, Sister</em> they were whole characters who got to be serious or silly, logical or impulsive, boy-crazy or booksmart. And they gave us the freedom to be all of the above too — well, depending on whether you were a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2020/11/10172757/where-to-watch-sister-sister-netflix-canada"">Tia or Tamera</a> (my good grades, shyness, and constant need for parental approval made me a Tia of course). <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/10/10111555/twitches-halloween-movie-underrated"">And with </a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/10/10111555/twitches-halloween-movie-underrated"">Twitches</a></em> (and <em>Twitches Too</em>), they redefined spooky season. Something that didn’t always <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2021/10/10731680/growing-up-black-without-halloween"">feel like it was for us</a> was suddenly anchored by a movie starring two Black girls, and 20 years later, it’s still a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-horror-films-movies-shows"">Halloween staple. </a></p>



<p>Now, the Tia and Tamera sightings are fewer and farther between. So much so that last year when Tia mentioned on her docuseries <em>Tia Mowry: My Next Act</em> that she wished the two were “still close” the internet was convinced the twins had fallen out. Later, <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/tia-tamera-mowry-relationship-now-rcna172091"">Tia Mowry clarified</a> that she and Tamera (now Mowry-Housley after marrying Adam Housley) are better than good and still as close as ever, they just live apart and are busy with their respective professions (both have maintained successful acting careers for the past two decades) and families, naturally. And yet, when the duo reunited recently in <a href=""https://people.com/tia-mowry-tamera-mowry-housley-love-reuniting-focusing-on-what-really-matters-during-holidays-exclusive-11838188"">partnership with HomeGoods</a> for <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DQR_KO2Aa2I/?hl=en"">Deck the Everything Day</a>, the fact that they were in the same place at the same time prompted social media users to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQap_IKkZJ4/?igsh=N2ZleXBqdmsxc2Y0"">lose their minds</a>. </p>



<p>When Tia and Tamera logged on — together — for our Zoom interview, I wish I could say I kept my chill. I didn’t. The nostalgia was too strong. I reverted right back to the kid who worshiped at the altar of <em>Sister, Sister </em>reruns every day after school and who made her entire identity for multiple Halloweens doing the <em><a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@todayshow/video/7159649084423294250?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Twitches</a></em><a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@todayshow/video/7159649084423294250?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> chant</a>. Tis the season to relive our obsession with Tia and Tamera so it’s only fitting that the duo are back together for the holidays for <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/homegoods-kicks-off-third-annual-deck-the-everything-day-with-early-store-openings-inviting-shoppers-to-shop-early-and-unleash-their-holiday-alter-egos-302597797.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">HomeGoods annual </a><em><a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/homegoods-kicks-off-third-annual-deck-the-everything-day-with-early-store-openings-inviting-shoppers-to-shop-early-and-unleash-their-holiday-alter-egos-302597797.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Deck the Everything Day</a>, </em>a holiday created for those early decorators who can’t wait to kick off the holiday season<em>. </em>It was surreal to see their distinct personalities on full display as they chatted about their dueling holiday alter egos, whose mac and cheese is better, and which Mowry sibling is hosting Thanksgiving this year. Here, we get into all of the above — plus, Tia and Tamera talk about what <em>Twitches</em> means to them all these years later and what <em>they</em> mean to Black women. </p>



<p><strong>I’m getting emotional just seeing you two together! Everyone is always so happy to see you both in the same place. Do you feel that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia Mowry: </strong>Yesterday, every five minutes we were getting stopped. And the word that everybody was saying was “nostalgia.” They were so happy to see both of us together. They would see [Tamera] and then when they would see me, they were like, “Oh my god! Hey!” They just lit up when they would see both of us. So basically, what you just did was happening all day yesterday. It was very, very sweet.</p>

<p><strong>You mean so much to me! Do you understand how much you mean to millennial women, especially Black women? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>Thank you. Yesterday, a girl asked for a photo with us and she said the same thing. So I am honored. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera Mowry-Housley: </strong>We are honored. It’s so sweet. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>I think [we do understand] now. I think when we were younger, we never really did — </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>That’s interesting. I did in the sense of our natural hair. So many young and up and coming actors now, they would say,<em> thank you so much for representation. You let me know that someone like me can do this, but not only that, someone with my hair. </em>Because, as you know, in the last decade, our natural hair wasn’t always accepted, especially on television and in the workforce. So when they saw us, they’re like,<em> oh my gosh, yes, I can wear my natural hair.</em> It’s beautiful.</p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>Yeah, I think, now, and especially in our late — </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>Gosh, don’t say it. </p>



<p><strong>Tia:</strong> In our late 40s! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>You look good, girl! </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>Thank you, you too!<em> [laughs]</em> Now, in our <em>late 40s</em>, I’m truly understanding the impact of representation and how important it is to see women that look like you be celebrated, and I feel that it leans into the quote, “if you see it, you be it.” And so I think that’s why I followed [your statement] with, “I am honored,” because it’s not easy. Being in the positions that we are in, it’s a constant battle. It’s a constant fight, just being a woman in general.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>So many young and up and coming actors now, they say,<em> </em>‘thank you so much for representation.

<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>I can speak for Hallmark. When I started at Hallmark — it’s been about seven years —  I remember not seeing women like me at all on that network, and I got to give it to Michelle Vicary, who is there now, she gave me my chance. She was like, “listen, we want you to tell your stories. I’m going to give you three films to produce.” And I was like, <em>Oh my gosh, the pressure!</em> But also, like Tia was saying, I felt very honored. I did a movie called <em>Girlfriendship</em>, an all-Black woman cast <em>on Hallmark</em> and literally, the producers came back and said, “we’ve had the most Black audience we’ve ever had on Hallmark, thank you.” That felt beautiful and amazing. And I’m happy that I’m still there. I still get to tell all kinds of stories of what Black families look like. We’re biracial, I get to tell those stories. And to be honest, the response as the new person, the trailblazer going in there, telling these stories, it wasn’t always positive. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>Yeah, and that’s why I said there’s still a challenge. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>But we’re doing it! </p>



<p><strong>You’re partnering with HomeGoods. Tell me more about that collaboration.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>Let me tell you this, one thing about HomeHoods that I love is there’s representation. So when you see the Santas, you see some Black Santas. It’s amazing. You’ll see some Black nutcrackers. When I saw them I was like, <em>let’s go! </em></p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>Tia always says she loves for people to feel seen, feel heard, and understood. And what’s so cool is that this campaign focuses on the holiday alter ego that comes out</p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>And doing the holidays your way! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>There’s so many different styles. There’s so many different styles, so many different HomeGoods holiday carols that you can choose from that you feel like represents your festive alter ego. </p>



<p><strong>What’s the difference between your holiday alter egos? Who’s the early decorator? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia and Tamera (in unison): </strong>We’re both early decorators! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>For our Thanksgiving dinner that I hosted for our family, it was Christmas. There was Christmas everywhere, but Tia’s more whimsical, winter whimsy. </p>



<p><strong>Tia:</strong> Sparkle, sparkle, baby! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>Yes, glam! I am an ever green icon. So the traditional Christmas colors that you think of — red, green, that cozy, warm, traditional woodsy vibe. But what’s cool is I have blue ornaments, I’ll embody the golden glam Holiday Carol alter ego and I’ll add some gold in there. I love interior design, I love decorating, I love hosting. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>I don’t think a day goes by during the Halloween season when a stranger that we don’t know goes, “Oh my gosh, I love <em>Twitches</em>.”</p><cite>tia mowry on the 20-year anniversary of ‘twitches’</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>Tia:</strong> And hosting on a budget, okay? And that’s what’s so amazing about HomeGoods. I’m telling you, when you look at the prices, you’re like <em>what!? </em>I literally saw a huge Nutcracker. And I love Nutcrackers. We grew up with Nutcrackers. Our mom loves pecans and walnuts, and she would always bring out that Nutcracker. But there was a huge Nutcracker, maybe four, five feet tall, and it was 100 dollars! </p>



<p><strong>We’re talking about holidays so I would love to know your favorite holiday memory together. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia and Tamera (in unison): </strong>Oooh! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>I have a memory, and it was together, I just don’t know if you remember it<em> [laughs]. </em>My memory sometimes is her memory. I’ll say “I remember…” and Tia will be like — </p>



<p><strong>Tia and Tamera (in unison): </strong>“No, that was me!” </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>Tia, do you remember <em>Polar Express,</em> this book, about if you have hope and you believe in magic, you can hear a bell. So we would always read that book to our brother, Tahj, and still to this day, he loves that book. I’ve passed down reading that book to my kids, but there was a moment where I could have sworn we were eight years old and I heard Santa’s footsteps, and I heard the bells. Do you remember that, Tia? </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940561.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p><strong>Tia:</strong> Yes, I do! We really thought it was really Santa because we heard the bells from the reindeer, but it was Dad. We ended up realizing later it was Dad. Our parents did such a great job. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>We believed [in Santa] until we were 11 years old. Yeah, we believed for a long time! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera, you said you hosted Thanksgiving. Are you hosting this year? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>No, we oscillate.<strong> </strong>I always host Christmas but on Thanksgiving we oscillate. It was you last year, me the year before that, so now Tahj is hosting this year. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>We’re going over to his house and we’re all going to be there. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>We do potluck style with Tahj.</p>



<p><strong>Who brings the mac and cheese?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>I do. I can throw down on some mac and cheese. And you know who’s really  good at mac and cheese now?</p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>[our other brother] Tavior. [My husband] Adam’s good too!</p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>But girl he can’t touch my mac and cheese, I’m sorry. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>You know what we should do? We should have the family vote. We need to have a mac and cheese competition between Adam’s, Tavior’s and yours. So you know if you won hands down. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>I’ve tasted Adam’s mac and cheese, girl, and it’s fabulous. It’s great too. But he can’t beat my mac and cheese. Sorry<em> [laughs].</em></p>



<p><strong>We know that you’re both moms, and during the holidays you’re hanging out with each other’s families. Who would your kids say is the fun Auntie between the two of you? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia:</strong> I’m gonna say me. I am so the fun Auntie! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera:</strong> But what would they say about me? </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>I would say that they think that you’re really sweet. And warm and cool. </p>



<p><em>[Editor’s note: Tamera’s phone rings and it’s her husband Adam] </em></p>



<p><strong>Tia:</strong> That’s Adam. Tell him my mac and cheese is better!<em> [laughs]</em></p>



<p><strong>Tamera</strong><strong><em> [on the phone]:</em></strong><strong> </strong>Adam, we’re doing an interview right now. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>Lord have mercy on my soul! My mac and cheese is better than your mac and cheese, Adam! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>What do you say, Adam?</p>



<p><strong><em>[Adam through the phone]</em></strong>: I’m not getting in the middle of this one! </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>SMART man! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera:</strong> I love you, I’ll call you later. <em>[hangs up phone] </em></p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940564.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=762&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A381"" /></figure>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>So I’m the one that’s like, let’s come over to the house and have sleepovers, and let’s jump in the pool, and let’s go to amusement parks and stuff like that. Not that you’re not, but [Tamera], you’re very warm. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera</strong>: If they want to talk about something, or if they’re having a challenging time and just want to release and chill. We’ll watch movies and just relax.</p>



<p><strong>It’s spooky season so everyone is doing their <em>Twitches</em></strong><strong> re-watch. Did you know when you were doing Twitches that all these years later people would still be so obsessed with it?  Does it still blow your mind? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>It blows my mind that people have tatted themselves with the sun and the moon. I’ve seen tattoos! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera:</strong> They have Halloween parties, like the Halloween parties are themed around <em>Twitches</em>. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>I don’t think a day goes by during the Halloween season when a stranger that we don’t know goes, “Oh my gosh, I love <em>Twitches</em>.”</p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>Tia and I loved <em>Halloweentown. </em>Remember, we were obsessed with <em>Halloweentown, </em>and we had no idea that <em>Twitches</em> was going to become one of those. It is insane. Like, it’s iconic. It’s <em>Sister, Sister </em>and <em>Twitches</em>. That’s what we hear the most. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>People actually don’t know that we improvised the [“Go Twitches, go Twitches” chant]. I forgot what the director said but he was just saying, like, have fun. I think in the script it just said “Twitches” or “Twin witches” or something like that. And then we were like — </p>



<p><strong>Tia and Tamera (in unison): </strong>“Go Twitches, go Twitches!” [<em>laughs</em>]</p>



<p><strong>Tamera:</strong> It’s like “go home, Roger!” </p>



<p><strong>That’s our time but I was just going to ask you both to turn to each other and give each other the proverbial flowers that we collectively give to you all the time.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia and Tamera (in unison): </strong>Aww! </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>We really, really appreciate that. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>You know, we should really do that today, give each other [actual] flowers. I’m serious! </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>No, I know. Let’s go get some flowers. </p>
