<p>When you hold a seashell to your ear, you hear the sound of the sea. I wonder who first said that? As a child, I found it strange that I could indeed hear something like waves crashing.

<p>Standing out for its uniqueness in the landscape and for its proximity to the sea, Miramar Tower is similar to the buildings in Pasteleira Park to the north, in proportion and dimension, but otherwise completely distinctive in its concept approach. The volumetric composition is the result of the architectural drive with the ambition to develop housing typologies with more than 200 square meters of balcony areas per floor. On top of the podium, a vertical volume with 15 storeys emerges, parallel to the road and with roughly the same height as the tower buildings in this area. By locating the building in the most central part of the plot, it ensures maximum spacing for all adjacent buildings. Evidencing a structuralist matrix with vertical dendriform section, the building is adaptable to the typology optimization. The floors, organized with one or two rooms, create a spiral speech where the apparent rotation and modelling of the terraces at 360 degrees give it a visual and real sense of verticality.</p>",

<p><em>Background</em> – This building, completed in 1966 in Seoul's Sinchon district, was built during a period of rapid urbanization. Aerial photographs by Kim Han-Yong from the same year show the Han River area still largely undeveloped, while the city, under its push for rapid construction, was beginning to transform the urban landscape at an unprecedented pace. The history of the building over the past five decades is unclear, but its condition today is severely deteriorated. Four of its eight columns extended beyond the site boundary, and what is now a four-story structure began as a modest two-story building on independent foundations. Later, a third floor of masonry and a fourth floor of lightweight steel were added, leaving the structure stacked precariously, like a Jenga tower.</p>",

<p>A wall prototype seeks a balance between structure and form, creating a resting space beneath a cantilevered roof. Each unit is a small pavilion. The village is home to old rammed earth houses and aging craftsmen. Bamboo is abundant in the area, and bamboo factories are a local industry. Concrete, wooden formwork, and steel are readily available and sustainable materials. The design prioritizes materials, creating a symbiotic dance of diverse materials. Concrete piers lift the rammed earth walls, which in turn lift the bamboo beams and columns. The bamboo, concrete beams, and steel poles stabilize the earth walls, and then lift the steel beams and wooden arches. The arched crown cantilevers outward, creating a delicate balance. Each component is a structural element, providing appropriate force and form. The heaviness of concrete, the thickness of rammed earth, the lightness of bamboo, the fineness of steel, and the thinness and bulk of wood create visual tension through their interplay.</p>",

<h4>AI can generate text, but only a designer can generate strategy, empathy, and safety.</h4><p>Imagine a neighborhood with no sidewalks or ramps. Someone using a wheelchair or a parent pushing a stroller is immediately forced to drive or rely on others just to run simple errands.</p><p>This planning was intentional: it was designed for cars and against people who need help getting around. Every single choice, from storm drain placement to road approval, was a decision that left people out. Just as poor infrastructure creates physical barriers, unclear language creates digital barriers.</p><figure><img alt=""Minimalist illustration of a suburban street with a light grey asphalt road, a high sidewalk, a streetlamp, and green rolling hills under a light blue sky"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8j6He40LoOSgVN1e5a-8Uw.png"" /><figcaption>An illustration of a grey asphalt road bordered on the right by a high, light-colored sidewalk with a distinct, vertical curb — (Grant Yun).</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve recently become responsible for most of the UX writing on my product team, handling everything from button labels to complex error flows, and I know I’m not alone. In countless organizations, product designers are often the ones filling in the final text. Because this is usually the last step, it’s easy to treat the content as a quick fill-in, something you automate or even turn to AI to quickly generate.</p><p>Over time, I’ve realized that this perspective misses the point. <strong>The writing is the design.</strong> The rise of AI tools only makes this clearer: AI can generate text, but only a designer can generate strategy, empathy, and safety. When you view every word as a key design element, you move past simple writing and actually create the user’s experience.</p><p>For any designer who feels writing is just an extra task, this article shares a framework. It treats language as a core design function and the essential tool for building products that are usable, useful, and responsible.</p><h3><strong>Writing vs. Designing</strong></h3><p>When approaching a piece of content, most people immediately ask: <em>“How should those words be written?”</em> This is a tough place to start. Before you write anything, you must first think about designing the experience you want your users to have.</p><p>This is the key difference between the two mindsets:</p><ul><li>Writing Mindset asks: <em>How many words will fit here? How should I describe this action?</em></li><li>Design Mindset asks: <em>What problem are we solving? What terms are our users familiar with? What happens next?</em></li></ul><p>Writing is about fitting words together. Designing is about solving problems for your users. You cannot have one without the other; they must work together.</p><p>As Nicole Fenton, coauthor of <em>Nicely Said</em>, puts it: “<em>I use language to solve problems… I use words as material [1].</em>”</p><p>Your words build digital experiences. You are designing interfaces that allow people to pay bills, send emails, or order food. Every word included in those experiences directly shapes the user’s understanding, feeling, and outcome.</p><h3><strong>The usable useful responsible (UUR) framework</strong></h3><p>Designing with words is more than just arranging letters into sentences. To be truly effective, you have to think of your work not as a writing task, but as a design mandate. It demands skills far beyond basic writing.</p><figure><img alt=""The Usable, Useful, Responsible Framework text is shown above a large, yellow, four-stud building block (like a LEGO brick). The brick symbolizes the foundational components of the design framework."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hxr5i39R1NYwKkafChP-_A.png"" /><figcaption>The image shows a LEGO block, symbolizing the building block of a designer’s writing: the Usable, Useful, Responsible Framework</figcaption></figure><h4>1. Usable words</h4><p>When a product is usable, people can complete their tasks without needing help or instructions. For designers, creating usability means making sure your words act as a guide. The language itself must be clear so users can quickly finish their task.</p><p>This level of clarity is critical for everyone, but especially for those with cognitive disabilities, those who are stressed, or those using screen readers. As content design expert Sarah Richards says: <strong><em>“Accessibility is usability.”</em></strong> If your words aren’t easy for everyone to use, you’ve made a design choice that prevents some people from using your product [2].</p><p>Consider a simple login screen on a mobile app. The way the error message is written determines if the user can easily proceed:</p><ul><li><strong>Unusable writing (Poor design)</strong></li></ul><p>Login failed (<em>User is confused; they must guess if the email, password, or registration is the problem.</em>) (<em>User is offered no path forward.</em>)</p><ul><li><strong>Usable writing (<em>Good design</em>)</strong></li></ul><p>Email not registered. Sign up or check for typos. (<em>User knows exactly what is wrong: their account doesn’t exist.</em>) (<em>User is offered a clear, actionable solution: register or correct their mistake.</em>)</p><figure><img alt=""A comparison of two mobile login screens. The screen on the left shows an unclear error: “Login failed.” The screen on the right shows a clear, useful error message under the email field: “Email not registered. Sign up or check for typos.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6ZDivlMQGmS3DVHnwJ5MPg.png"" /><figcaption>A comparison between two different ways a login screen handles an error, illustrating the difference between unuseful and useful feedback.</figcaption></figure><p>This demonstrates how usable writing guides the user by providing clarity (<em>what went wrong</em>) and actionability (<em>what to do next</em>).</p><h4>2. Useful words</h4><p>For your words to be useful, you need to understand and honor your users’ intent. Useful writing gives people control and prioritizes their needs, balancing them with business goals. When you respect users, they are motivated to keep giving you their time and attention.</p><p>For example, when a user intends to delete an account, useful writing must provide a clear path to complete that goal. A design that makes this process intentionally difficult through deceptive language is a classic example of making a product unuseful.</p><p><strong>Unuseful writing (User-hostile design)</strong></p><blockquote>“Hold On! Are You Sure You Want to Deactivate Your Profile and Lose Your Benefits?”</blockquote><p>Uses emotionally charged language, focusing on loss, to dissuade the user from their clear intent. Buttons: Cancel (Prominently styled, primary color) and Deactivate Later (Small, secondary color).</p><p>The issue here is it offers “Deactivate” instead of “Delete” to mislead the user into thinking the account is merely paused, retaining their data for marketing.)</p><p><strong>Useful writing (User-first design)</strong></p><blockquote>“Permanently Delete Your Account?”</blockquote><p>This is direct, unambiguous question honoring the user’s intent. Buttons: Yes, Delete Account (Clear, destructive) and Cancel (Neutral color).</p><p>It gives the user the necessary control and confirms the final, irreversible action.</p><figure><img alt=""A comparison of two account closure screens. The screen on the left, marked with an ‘X’, uses a dark pattern by asking the user to “Deactivate later,” making it difficult to find the option to permanently delete the account. The screen on the right, marked with a checkmark, has a clear title, “Permanently delete your account,” and a prominent red “Yes, Delete account” button."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*S6Kz54gsU90EUmzkt16HEA.png"" /><figcaption>A side-by-side comparison of user interfaces for closing an account, demonstrating good and bad design.</figcaption></figure><p>Useful writing focuses on what people want from your product or service and asks how you can balance that with business goals, rather than focusing purely on what the business can get out of it.</p><h4>3. Responsible words</h4><p>As a designer, you are responsible for what you put into the world. To write responsibly, you have to consider how your words could be used and, crucially, misused.</p><p>Irresponsible writing often weaponizes language. A popular example is “confirm-shaming,” where an interface asks a user for something (like an email) and then forces them to say or think something negative about themselves to decline.</p><figure><img alt=""Website footer featuring a newsletter subscription box that employs Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) text to pressure users into signing up to avoid “paying more” or missing “insider knowledge.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*542HwlftSE_p38Y_YDOlOw.png"" /><figcaption>A footer dark pattern example using fear of missing out (FOMO) and implied punishment (“paying more”) to pressure users into subscribing.</figcaption></figure><p>For instance, in a static footer that asks for an email:</p><ul><li>The headline creates anxiety: <strong><em>“Don’t be the last to know!”</em></strong></li><li>The subtext acts as the shaming mechanism: <strong><em>“If you’re okay with missing out on essential insider knowledge and paying more, just scroll on by.”</em></strong> This forces the user to internally validate that they are “okay with missing out” and “paying more” in order to ignore the field, making the act of declining feel like a financial or intellectual failure.</li></ul><p>As a designer, it’s your responsibility to consider not just how your writing will be used, but also how it could be misused, whether by an algorithm, others in your company, or malicious people. You must ask: <strong>Are they true? Are they kind? Are they inclusive?</strong></p><h3>Aligning your team before you write</h3><p>I’ve spent time with my team and stakeholders debating word choice. For example, should a button say “Buy” or “Purchase”? Stakeholders often look for a “best practice” answer: what does Amazon do? But asking this question is frustrating and distracts from the real issue.</p><figure><img alt=""A side-by-side comparison of two identical product cards for Wireless Headphones priced at ₦45,000. The card on the left uses a clear black button labeled “Buy.” The card on the right uses a black button labeled “Purchase”."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rm4pzevukAWkAjP4zpHePg.png"" /><figcaption>A visual comparison of product card buttons: one uses the clear, direct label “<strong>Buy</strong>,” while the other uses the more verbose label “<strong>Purchase</strong>.”</figcaption></figure><p>The right answer isn’t about being right or wrong. It’s about what works for your users and what your team needs to achieve. Before you can choose “Buy” or “Purchase,” you need a clear strategy.</p><blockquote>Strategy simply means getting everyone aligned on a shared focus. It tells the team what to do, and what to ignore.</blockquote><p>A simple strategy statement connects four key elements:</p><ol><li>User Type</li><li>User Need</li><li>Value Provided</li><li>Business Benefit</li></ol><p>For example:</p><blockquote><em>“</em>We help budget-conscious buyers easily acquire high-quality audio gear so they can enjoy superior sound immediately, which supports AudioFlow’s goal of increasing first-time conversions and positive word-of-mouth.”</blockquote><p>This statement immediately provides direction. Since the goal is easy acquisition for a wide, budget-conscious audience, choosing the clearest, most conversational word “Buy” over the more formal “Purchase” is the right strategic move.</p><h3>A framework for writing with AI</h3><p>The fundamentals of good writing are clarity, concision, and empathy, and they remain essential even with AI tools. While AI can draft text very quickly, its output often lacks soul. What makes UX writing truly effective is your ability to go beyond that basic text by understanding the user’s context, establishing a consistent brand voice, and skillfully modulating the tone.</p><figure><img alt=""A dark-themed AI chat interface with the text, “What are you working on?” and an input field labeled “+ Ask anything.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iFCaD0VnkoHsOfo6poGUtQ.png"" /><figcaption>The image displays a minimal, dark-themed AI chat interface</figcaption></figure><p>To integrate AI responsibly without compromising your voice, ethics, or craft, adopt a mindset where AI is a co-pilot used for generating options, while you the designer remain the pilot responsible for strategy and empathy.</p><p>Use this three-step strategic filter to integrate AI outputs into your workflow:</p><h4>1. Prompt with strategy</h4><p>Your input to the AI must be dictated by your established voice and tone documentation, not just your immediate need. Instead of a simple request like “<em>Write an error message</em>,” let your prompt provide a clear strategy like:</p><blockquote>“Write a toast notification message for a mobile app. The user just clicked an expired password reset link. Use a confident, empathetic, and direct tone. The message must tell them to request a new link, and it must be concise.”</blockquote><p>This single prompt bundles the following elements:</p><ul><li><strong>Voice &amp; Tone:</strong> “confident, empathetic, and direct tone”</li><li><strong>Constraint:</strong> “toast notification message for a mobile app,” must “be concise,” and must tell them to “request a new link.”</li></ul><p>The resulting AI output, <strong>“</strong><em>Your link has expired.

Filter for empathy (Review)</h4><p>The first and most critical step when reviewing AI output is to filter for the human element and inclusivity. AI outputs often rely on aggregated data that can perpetuate bias, use idioms, or assume an emotional state.</p><ul><li><strong>Check for Exclusion:</strong> Does the output use any terminology (gendered, ableist, or overly colloquial) that might alienate a specific population?</li><li><strong>Check for Assumption:</strong> Does the message assume the user is happy, smart, or calm? (e.g., avoid “Great job!” or “Finally!”)</li><li><strong>Check for Idioms:</strong> Is the language literal and ready for translation, or does it rely on cultural shorthand that an international user or machine translator would miss?</li></ul><figure><img alt=""An example of an AI simplifying an idiomatic English text for better translatability and clarity.

Edit for core principles (Output)</h4><p>After the output passes the empathy filter, focus on refining the language to ensure it is clear, concise, and authentically human.</p><ul><li><strong>Clear:</strong> Edit for ambiguity. Ensure the language precisely describes the action and the object. For example, does the button label “Save” mean “Save All” or “Save this section”? This clarity is paramount.</li><li><strong>Concise:</strong> Cut out extra words<strong>.</strong> Look at what the AI wrote and remove anything you don’t need, like long, overly nice phrases or confusing descriptions. These just slow the user down. Your main goal is to get to the point quickly so the user can finish their task fast and easily.</li><li><strong>Human:</strong> Finally, edit for rhythm by reading the final output aloud to check for natural cadence. Does the writing sound like a robot, or does it flow naturally with appropriate contractions and pacing? The human ear is the ultimate tool for catching stilted or forced language, ensuring the final tone is authentic and engaging.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""An example of an AI successfully applying UX writing principles (Clear, Concise, Human) to rewrite a long, passive sentence into the direct call-to-action: “Click the button below to save your work and keep your changes.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/841/1*wyYZ2s8cL7KKXuCCI19ZzQ.png"" /><figcaption>The image shows a conversation with an AI where the user is successfully using UX writing principles to edit a draft text</figcaption></figure><p>By following this three-step framework of strategic prompting, empathy filtering, and editing for clarity, concision, and human tone, you can use AI to create high-quality UX copy without losing your voice or affecting the user experience.</p><h3>Designing error messages that help users</h3><p>Error messages are often the most visible things we write, and they appear exactly when users are stressed and confused. While the best error is one that never happens, we must treat any error as a chance to help people finish their work.</p><p>When people use a product, they are focused on completing a task, not on figuring out how the app works. Running into an error is a hard stop to their goal. Instead of assuming the user is doing something “wrong,” your job is to design a better experience. <em>As expert Kathy Sierra says, focus on helping your users become “more skillful, more powerful users [3].”</em></p><h4>The problem with generic errors</h4><p>Companies often blame the user for errors as a way to protect their own image. However, error messages that quietly point the finger at the user and make them feel bad actually harm the brand, causing people to stop using the product and decreasing loyalty.</p><p>When the real problem is a technology or design failure, you should be honest. For example, the email service Mailchimp uses its distinct brand voice to be apologetic, transparent, and helpful when an error occurs. This approach shows they’re committed to guiding the user forward, not blocking them.</p><figure><img alt=""An example of transparent customer service communication from Mailchimp Support, acknowledging a server outage and setting expectations for a multi-hour resolution time."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/426/1*uVDnV1xXKW2ACp25PicWdw.png"" /><figcaption>The image displays an example of effective, honest error communication, characteristic of a user-first approach.</figcaption></figure><p>If something goes wrong, do everything you can to make sure your users aren’t taking the blame. Focus on helping them achieve their goal.</p><h4>The designer’s error framework</h4><p>To guide users through or around failures, you must design your language using three principles:</p><ul><li><strong>Avoid:</strong> The best error message is the one the user never sees. Use visual design and interaction (like autocomplete or automatic formatting) to prevent the error from happening in the first place.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Mobile address search interface showing real-time autocomplete suggestions to help the user find and select a location and avoid typing errors."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Aq6tX3Ha-83mo9V5ho_Vgw.png"" /><figcaption>The image shows an example of the avoid principle in the error framework, using interactions like autocomplete to prevent data entry errors</figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Explain:</strong> When an error occurs, clearly and quickly tell the user what went wrong and why (e.g., “Your return date must be after your departure date”). Never leave the user guessing.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Mobile travel booking form showing a date validation error. The return date is incorrectly set before the departure date, and an explicit error message explains the required date order to the user."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rHwhSDosSBAzaOZfIyT6SQ.png"" /><figcaption>The image shows a mobile screen for a travel booking app demonstrating the explain principle of the error framework.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Resolve:</strong> Easily the most critical component. Always provide a clear next step. Don’t just say “File too large”; say, “This file exceeds the 10MB limit. Try compressing the file or uploading a smaller version.”</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Mobile document upload screen showing a failed upload error for a PDF file that exceeds the 10MB limit, along with actionable advice to compress or upload a smaller file."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YRsg5H0dsboz3UNop3agrg.png"" /><figcaption>The image shows a mobile screen for uploading a document with an error, demonstrating the Resolve principle of the error framework</figcaption></figure><p>Your final task is to ensure the user is supported, not stalled, as they move toward their goal.</p><p>You’re now equipped to expose product flaws, justify your language choices with data, and ensure your product is usable, useful, and responsible.</p><p>AI will generate text faster than you can, but it cannot deliver empathy, define your brand’s ethics, or apply the strategic filter needed to build user trust. That level of intention remains your non-negotiable human power.</p><p>Embrace the words, embrace the strategy, and own your role as the ultimate experience designer.</p><h3>References</h3><p>[1] https://www.nicolefenton.com/words-as-material/</p><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nle2HbYTJU"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nle2HbYTJU</a></p><p>[3] <a href=""https://medium.com/building-winning-products/kathy-sierra-on-designing-for-badass-ba92cd5fad96"">https://medium.com/building-winning-products/kathy-sierra-on-designing-for-badass-ba92cd5fad96</a></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a8ccde162d35"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-writing-is-the-design-a8ccde162d35"">The writing is the design</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4><em>We changed our design mindset. We transitioned from building all the interfaces and prototypes to allowing others to develop their ideas in a safe place, following our design and product rules.</em></h4><figure><img alt=""lego pieces from the internet"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hlqhE85hxbODSNrRSZUXZw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Since we started embracing the “production acceleration stage” in the company, we see product design with fresh perspectives.</figcaption></figure><h4>Fully immersed in AI dynamics</h4><p>Like almost all technology companies today, we are influenced and affected by AI at our core. Part of this technology adoption has brought new company challenges <em>(ways of work, roles, technical knowledge, etc)</em>. Still, it has also led to many positive developments and ideas, allowing us to transform old problems into new opportunities.</p><p>Once AI was established as the new technology core, we are playing in a new, unknown field full of opportunities but also uncertainties. How do we build products now? How do we design? How do we work under new rules and roles? Those are questions that we don’t have a solid answer to yet, but in time, we will figure it out. The other side of the story is the opportunities AI will uncover if we choose to adopt this new approach with conviction.</p><p>This article explains how we <em>(a Latam HR rising start-up) </em>are innovating from a humble concept, an approach that has been positively adopted and significantly changed the way we work.</p><h4>From embracing AI to innovating with it</h4><p>Due to a company event (a hackathon), the UX team and I decided to build something special to present as pre-work. It was a fully functional chat interface made in Cursor for all teams to use and place their ideas, ensuring that whatever they create will maintain all Design System tokens and components. From this simple idea, something bigger started to grow after the event. We wondered what would happen if we decided to build a fully functional dummy platform where everyone could create, play, and share? That’s how the <strong>Product Playground</strong> was born — a simple tool that has already made us think about how we should work from now on.</p><h4>What’s a Product Playground?</h4><figure><img alt=""Papumba video game"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YadChw-B6H4iGTomC6tYEQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Building mode is a popular feature in video games like Fortnite, Fallout 4, The Sims, Minecraft, and Roblox, among others. It allows players to construct, customize, and manipulate structures and objects within a game world.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The concept is straightforward yet robust because of the transformations we are experiencing in this new AI field. The concept of having a place where everyone can “build ideas” connects with the spirit of the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXFTXsWsBfo"">building mode feature in video games,</a> where users can construct, customize, and manipulate structures and objects within a game world.</p><p>Having a “test or creation environment” in tech companies has, until now, been one that only engineers could use, so enabling everyone to use a test platform to create products easily was disruptive, at least for us.</p><p>The definition goes like this <em>(still in progress)</em>: The Product Playground is a local environment that “simulates” products in a fundamental way, in terms of their structure and composition <em>(gray boxes and text)</em>. The idea is that it can be a place to “play” with quick ideas and functionalities, enabling us to have rapid conversations with teams and users.</p><p>Each PM and designer will have their own Playground, enabling them to share with other teams and internal and external clients, thus receiving faster feedback in an environment closely resembling production reality.</p><p>While creating this new dummy world with my teammate, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-vega-ux/""><strong>David Vega</strong></a>, we realized the potential we could exploit from it, along with the new challenges of protocols and design handoff. To us, those concerns were beautiful problems to tackle if the idea could make an impact, and it did.</p><h4>How does it work?</h4><a href=""https://medium.com/media/74d837ecfd7676b18af2583ebf6cf610/href"">https://medium.com/media/74d837ecfd7676b18af2583ebf6cf610/href</a><p>Part of the essence of the Product Playground is to be really friendly to everyone outside the engineering team; therefore, we decided to build this Playground with some UX foundations. To start, there is a “read me first” section where users can understand all the knowledge behind this tool, such as the definition, step-by-step setup, templates, design validator, and tool documentation.</p><p>Once users understand how to operate the tool <em>(it is effortless, though)</em>, they need to pull the repository where the playground lives, and that’s it; you can start to play. We were also cautious in providing some initial prompts to make fundamental changes within the tool, and from there, the imagination is the limit.</p><h4>Scopes and levels of solutions</h4><figure><img alt=""Playground interface"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lsXnttQ2K2uFwdgSDDF3Gw.png"" /><figcaption>Current Product Playground (home) interface with navigation and functional sections ready to be modified</figcaption></figure><p>We started small, as we always do when building products. So far, we have launched the first version of Product Playground and achieved our primary goal: to spark interest in creating products and sharing ideas among people. We believe this version shouldn’t be the end, so we are planning to evolve the AI tool into something more interesting. Here’s the evolution scope we’re planning:</p><p><strong>Phase one:<br /></strong>Mission: “Play and Share”<br />Contains the following features:</p><ul><li>Local environments</li><li>Local component library in Cursor (Design System tokens + components)</li><li>Playground publishing</li><li>100% responsive</li></ul><p><strong>Phase two:<br /></strong>Mission: “Real components, real environments”<br />Contains the following features:</p><ul><li>React environments (Collaborator + Admin)</li><li>Actual company library (MCP: Figma + tokens + components)</li><li>Playground publishing</li><li>100% responsive</li></ul><p><strong>Phase three:<br /></strong>Mission: “Company Standard Code”<br />Contains the following features:</p><ul><li>React environments (Collaborator + Admin)</li><li>UBITS library (MCP: Figma + tokens + components) + rules</li><li>Playground publishing</li><li>100% responsive</li><li>Code reviewed and optimized for engineering.</li></ul><p>We believe that with this AI tool or concept, our way of understanding product building has changed. From our company’s perspective, we see a lot of benefits to highlight, such as:</p><ul><li>Functional designs and ideas that can feel more real in their iterations.</li><li>Speed ​​in idea validation <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/did-ai-kill-the-systems-thinking-skills-in-ux-701f845f18d4""><em>(acceleration stage)</em></a>.</li><li>Shift from the “traditional” mindset that says I must rely on third parties to validate or create something.</li><li>Independence when building product experiences from an idea.</li><li>Engineering inputs; in more advanced phases of the Playground, the components and layouts will be the official ones from the company libraries.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Plagound interface"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/853/1*3qzuJFndKCkNLQpSBpwR3A.png"" /><figcaption>Interface exercise with real elements and components of the design system</figcaption></figure><p>We acknowledge that not everything is rainbows and sunshine. With this new way of building products, we anticipate some big questions and challenges, such as the role of a designer as we know it <em>(I’ll explain it in a few paragraphs)</em> and whether the new handoff method will be a Product playground link. What should happen with Figma files? Do we even need it since now we have a new construction platform? The reality is that we’re discovering answers as soon as we move with this idea. I hope to get you an answer in my next article.</p><h4>A new design mindset?</h4><p>As I mentioned at the beginning of this article, we’re experimenting with a possible design mindset shifting process; how do we know? With this new tool, interface design is not just a job for professionals; it’s for everyone. As a result, our design duty may shift to something unfamiliar: the design of systems, or as we’ve started to call it, <strong>Infrastructure design.</strong> We’re not pretending to add another design role to the already confusing list in the industry, but in scenarios like this, naming what we are building gives us ownership of ideas and processes.</p><p>Infrastructure design, as we understand it, involves the planning, design, and maintenance of a large product platform where others can come to build. Our priority right now is to provide all the building blocks <em>(Design system, user experiences, interactions, etc.) </em>to allow others to create. So immediately we launched the Product Playground, a worry started to circle our minds; with this tool, our design job will disappear? This is a valid question due to the significant hysteria in the design community since AI has become a permanent presence. My answer to that is no; there are still many things a designer can do that no one else can. The issue until now is that we have allowed companies to pigeonhole our work as only an interface exercise, and I believe it is more than that.</p><p>At the end of the day, if someone is creating stuff in a Playground, it is the designer who decides if such an invention is easy to use, coherent with user needs, and meets other relevant criteria.</p><p>Along with this “new concept” that only applies to design teams, there is another one with a broader scale that we are adopting, and I’d like to share: <strong>functional design</strong>. This concept refers to the Playground outcome, where ideas are essentially functional and ready to implement. We’ve abandoned static design and limited prototypes for rich interactions and complete flows that can be made in minutes.</p><p>When we talk about design now, we can see things working in a real environment and have more effective conversations with users and stakeholders. The sense of reality is a plus we haven’t had before.</p><p>Another topic we have been navigating and evangelizing within the design team is embracing “designs” from others, especially from those who are not designers. To clarify, the Product Playground is not open to everyone in the company, but only to people in the tech department <em>(PMs, sales, data, engineers, QA, etc). </em>The message is simple on this concern: What was once an insult to us as designers is now real collaboration. We can exchange design and experiences, and also teach them how to do it in the process.</p><h4>The new company’s way of working.</h4><p>Since we started embracing the “production acceleration stage” in the company, we see product design with fresh perspectives, especially with the Product Playground in the conversation. It may not be the right or only path to follow in the industry, but for us, it’s been quite a change.</p><p>The most compelling evidence we have to validate our hypothesis is time. Before all these concepts <em>(Acceleration stage, Product Playground, Infrastructure design, and functional design)</em>, building an idea went like this: Ideation → Model → Prototype → Engineering. The cycle was slow, expensive, and discouraged innovation, as typically only one idea was developed. Now, a process that used to take weeks only takes a few hours. Plus, we can test multiple versions of an interface quickly, preventing ideas from falling by the wayside.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=22f64e1bc59a"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-ai-concept-that-changed-our-companys-way-of-working-22f64e1bc59a"">The AI concept that changed our company’s way of working</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Gregory Bateson and the art of staying in conversation with yourself.</h4><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white portrait of an elderly man with light hair swept back, wearing a plaid shirt over a collared shirt. He has a gentle, knowing smile and expressive wrinkles that convey warmth and intelligence. The background is softly blurred, keeping focus on his face and thoughtful expression."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*k9P22tQEKIhurkG8V8E1CA.png"" /></figure><p>This week, someone asked me a question that deserves more than a quick answer:</p><blockquote><strong>How can a company get bigger without making the experience worse for the people who already trust it?</strong></blockquote><p><em>I’m </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/natesowder/""><em>Nate Sowder</em></a><em>, and this is unquoted, installment 10. Today, we’re talking mergers and acquisitions.</em></p><p><strong>At first, it sounds like a design problem.</strong> Or maybe a customer service one. Add new markets, new systems, new customers, and suddenly the challenge is keeping what was working while trying to understand what the future needs to become.</p><p>But underneath, it’s a question about honesty. What if the kind of growth that stretches empathy and deepens awareness (the kind we expect from people) could guide how organizations grow too? The trouble is, and it’s what I was really being asked, companies don’t usually grow that way. The bigger they get, the more they drift toward dilution. Uniformity starts to look like fairness. A drive for efficiency starts to feel like understanding. And every merger, no matter how strategic, risks erasing the small, specific things that made people trust you in the first place.</p><p>Which brings us to Gregory Bateson, the British anthropologist who spent his life asking how living systems hold together when they grow, collide or change. He called it <a href=""https://batesoninstitute.org/gregory-bateson/""><em>the ecology of mind</em></a>. His insight was simple… aaand difficult:</p><p><strong>Systems survive by staying in conversation with themselves.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white photograph of anthropologists Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson working at a wooden table in their thatched-roof home near the Sepik River in New Guinea.

Trained as an anthropologist, he moved through biology, psychiatry, cybernetics and communication theory as if they were chapters in a single unfinished book. He studied tribes in New Guinea, mapped communication patterns in families with schizophrenia, and helped define the early vocabulary of systems theory.</p><p>What he was really searching for was what he called the ‘pattern that connects’. Every living system, he argued, survives by registering difference — the small shifts that signal when something in the environment has changed. To Bateson, information was a relationship that needed to be maintained. It wasn’t something you could create and store away.</p><p>He saw life as a constant negotiation between something you are aware of and something you let drift. The moment a system stops sensing its surroundings, it begins to lose the capacity to learn. And what we often call stability is just the early phase of decline. In other words, if you aren’t working toward something, you’re automatically moving away from it.</p><p>That was the core of his thinking. He replaced the language of control with the language of relationship. A forest, an organization, even a mind. Each stays ‘alive’ by keeping the conversation open between its parts.</p><h3>When the conversation breaks</h3><p>Bateson’s ideas make mergers look less like transactions and more like ecological events. Two systems collide, each with its own rhythms, feedback loops and internal grammar. At first, both listen politely. Then they start talking over each other.</p><p>Signals that once made sense begin to distort. Teams over-interpret silence. Customers catch tonal shifts before any official announcement. That doesn’t mean the system is collapsing. What it means is that it’s losing its sense of self.</p><p>Bateson would’ve seen that as a feedback failure, not a leadership flaw. When new information enters a system and the interpretive loops are weak, the signal mutates (it doesn’t go away). Meaning goes looking for somewhere else to live.</p><p><strong>That’s the unseen cost of getting bigger.</strong> Growth multiplies ways to do things faster than it multiplies ways to understand things. And the louder a system gets, the easier it is to confuse agreement with coherence.</p><p>You’re probably thinking what I’m thinking: Every organization faces this… not just in mergers, but technology adoption, strategy, and research.</p><p>We build tools to listen faster, but not always to listen better. Bateson would call that <a href=""https://www.honest-broker.com/p/why-gregory-bateson-matters-a8d"">ecological deafness:</a> a feedback loop optimized for speed instead of reflection.</p><h3>Learning from differences</h3><p>Bateson believed that systems stay healthy by adjusting to the relationships between things. Every change, no matter how small, reshapes the conditions for what comes next. As a system receives information, the key isn’t how much it hears, but whether the hearing leads to reflection.</p><p>AI makes that harder. It expands what an organization can sense, but not what it understands. Algorithms pull in more signal, faster… but they don’t know what matters. And often, neither do we.</p><p>We’ve trained ourselves to think that hearing more means knowing more. But without a loop that turns signal into learning, it’s just a whole lot of noise.</p><p>Bateson’s answer would be:<br />- Humility. <br />- Keep the conversation open. <br />- Build systems that reflect before they respond.</p><h3>Staying in conversation with yourself</h3><p>It’s not that organizations fail because they stop collecting feedback. It’s more that they learn how to ignore it.</p><p>Even with dashboards, surveys, sentiment trackers… it’s easy to bend the story in whatever direction feels most comfortable.</p><p>A forest doesn’t get to do that. It doesn’t negotiate with fire, or spin a drought into a branding opportunity. It just responds.</p><p>Bateson’s point was that healthy systems don’t control the narrative.<br /><strong>They stay in conversation with it.</strong></p><p>If you want to grow without losing what made you trustworthy, build that kind of system.</p><p>Then let it tell you the truth. Even when you’d rather not hear it.</p><p><strong>The work is ahead.</strong><br />And Bateson shows us the way.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=631d44184013"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-ecology-of-a-merger-631d44184013"">The ecology of a merger</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>How designers create true alignment with visual thinking</h4><p>I want to tell you about my favorite apple. It’s incredible. It’s hands down the most delicious apple of all time! When you see it hanging on a tree, its color invites you to come closer and take a bite. When it’s ripe, the flavor is amazing, complemented with a delightfully pleasing texture. It’s a fantastic fruit that fills you with delight.</p><figure><img alt=""Hand draw picture of an apple shape with questions around it"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*dfRMi0iyg9vrfJYA.jpg"" /><figcaption>What kind of apple are you imagining?</figcaption></figure><p>Now, what kind of apple did you imagine? Was it red, green, or yellow? Was the taste tart, sweet, or mild? Where did you imagine that tree…in a field, backyard, or in an orchard? Every person reading this description has a different kind of apple in mind. Yet, we’re all speaking the same language, using the same terms to talk about the same apple. The language is the same, but the ideas in our heads are different.</p><p>This is what I call the “illusion of alignment,” and it doesn’t just happen with apples. It happens all the time in meetings, design reviews, planning sessions, emails, strategy documents and more.</p><h3>The Illusion in Action</h3><p>Imagine a product team spends weeks planning a major feature redesign. Everyone attends the kickoff meeting. The product manager presents the strategy doc. It’s thorough. It’s well-written. It covers all the bases. Heads nod around the room. Engineering gives a thumbs up. Architecture gives green lights. UX flashes a smile. The scope is clear. The goals are documented. Everyone agrees this is the right direction.</p><p>You take notes, ask a few clarifying questions, and get to work. Over the next several weeks, you explore concepts, refine the direction, and build out the solution. It feels good. It feels aligned. The check-ins go smoothly. Then comes the first design review…</p><p>The designer presents their work…the culmination of weeks of thinking, exploring, and refining. And the room… erupts. Not with excitement. With confusion. With concern. With frustration.</p><blockquote>“Wait, I thought we agreed on something simpler?”</blockquote><blockquote>“This isn’t what I had in mind at all.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Why did you go in this direction?”</blockquote><p>Everyone feels blindsided. The designer is confused because they followed the strategy, they asked questions, they thought everyone was aligned. The product manager is frustrated at the designer…clearly they didn’t read the brief. The leaders are worried…we’ve lost weeks, and now we have to start over. Engineers are annoyed since they’ve been planning their work around a completely different approach.</p><p>What happened? Everyone was using the same words the whole time. Everyone read the same document. Everyone nodded in the same meetings. But nobody was actually imagining the same thing.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Dyx0umta-Pm9z48R.jpg"" /><figcaption>Words are not the same as meaning.</figcaption></figure><h3>Words Are Squishier Than We Think</h3><p>Words are not concrete. As much as we want words to have specific, concrete, absolute meaning…they don’t. They’re abstractions that our brains automatically fill in based on our backgrounds, expertise, and experiences. Two people can use identical terms and mean completely different things. Two people can use wildly different terms and mean the <em>exact </em>same thing.</p><p>This shows up in a few different ways. Here are three examples:</p><p>The problem gets worse with documentation. We write things down and feel confident. Look, it’s right there on the page. It’s clear. It’s specific. But even detailed specifications get interpreted through different mental models. Your brain reads those words and instantly constructs an image based on what you know, what you’ve seen before, and what makes sense to you. Our brains make assumptions about the words and between the words to make sense of what we’re reading.</p><p>This isn’t because people are stupid or careless. This is human nature. It’s just how our minds work. It’s how we engage with and understand the world. We can’t help but fill in gaps with our own understanding.</p><h3>The Division It Breeds</h3><p>Before that design review, everything feels fine. There’s harmony in meetings. People are nodding. Documents are approved. Progress is being made. High fives all around. But underneath, an invisible gap is slowly widening. Everyone is building on different assumptions, creating different mental models, imagining different end states, and digging a deeper gulf between each other.</p><p>Then the designer shows their work and suddenly the gap becomes visible. What felt like alignment evaporates like a vapor. That alignment was simply an illusion.</p><p>Trust erodes. The designer feels like the goal posts just moved. The product manager feels ignored. Developers feel annoyed. Everyone questions everyone else’s competence. What was a collaborative team suddenly feels like a war zone.</p><p>We don’t just have a project setback, we have a relationship problem. People start documenting everything defensively. Politics emerge. Finger-pointing begins. The project screeches to a halt as everyone grasps for control of the situation.</p><p>This is what survival looks like. Everyone is genuinely trying to do the right thing. The division wasn’t intentional, it was invisible…until the pictures showed up.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*vYbB6DOAo9yKRECo.jpg"" /><figcaption>Pictures get closer to meaning.</figcaption></figure><h3>Designers as Bridge Builders</h3><p>The pictures. That’s where clarity started to emerge. This is where designers have a unique opportunity. We think visually (or at least we should). We externalize ideas in renderings to make sense of them. We don’t just imagine solutions in our heads, we sketch them, analyze them, erase them, trash them, and sketch some more. We refine them, prototype them, and make them feel more real. We make the invisible visible.</p><p>This puts us in a very opportunistic position. We can expose misalignment before division deepens. We can build bridges between abstract language and concrete forms. We have a chance to drive direction and clarity. We don’t need special authority or permission. We don’t need a “seat at the table”. We just need to do what comes naturally to us: draw.</p><p>A designer with a marker and a napkin can create more alignment in 1 minute than weeks of documented strategy. Not because the strategy is bad, but because the drawing makes everyone’s different mental pictures visible. It forces the misalignment to the surface early, when it’s still easy to correct. It grounds us in what could be, to drive the question of what should be.</p><p>This isn’t about gatekeeping or controlling the conversation. It’s about getting people to talk. It’s about helping everyone see the different pictures in each other’s heads so we can get really get aligned before we waste time, money, and relationships building the wrong things.</p><h3>Tactics for Creating Real Alignment</h3><p>This should be second nature for designers. But, it’s easy to get sucked into the practices and thinking of non-designers around us.</p><p>If this is new to you, or you’re looking for some helpful approaches, here are practical ways designers can use visual thinking to build bridges across different scenarios:</p><p>The goal of these isn’t to finalize decisions. It’s to avoid hidden assumptions and misalignment that will paint you into a corner later and undermine the value you’re delivering to users.</p><h3>Just Draw a Picture</h3><p>Remember our favorite apple from the beginning? The one we imagined differently even though we used the same language? It looks like we’re aligned because we’re talking about an apple. Even if we start talking about details, we still appear to be aligned. It’s not until concrete renderings are introduced that the true state of alignment is shown. This is where the practice of design shines. Every strategy session. Every kickoff. Everyone’s got a different apple in their head. We can help draw it out.</p><figure><img alt=""Hand draw illustration of a marker"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*TYuQ0iT4r6EzcFQP.jpg"" /><figcaption>Grab a marker and just draw a picture for clarity.</figcaption></figure><p>This doesn’t require process overhaul, you can do it any time. It doesn’t need expensive tools, you just need a pencil. It doesn’t require anyone’s permission, just some courage on your part. We need to do what comes naturally to designers: think visually. Make ideas concrete. Turn words into form. Show, don’t just tell.</p><p>There’s been a lot of talk over the years about designers needing a seat at the table. I don’t believe you need to be at the table to influence the people at the table. You need to create artifacts that create shared understanding, and show the path forward. You need to be the one who makes what’s invisible visible before the division breeds and relationships fracture. If everyone at the table is aligned going in, you don’t have to be there to try and align them.</p><p>We’re surrounded by a world addicted to speed and productivity. Some may think drawing is a waste of time, or inappropriate for “serious business discussions,” or something you do later in the “design phase.” They won’t naturally reach for a marker. But we will. Because we’re the ones who instinctively know that pictures are worth 1,000 strategy documents, and pictures create the concrete to help us understand the wicked problems we’re asked to solve.</p><p>Next meeting, bring a sketch. Even a crude one. Spend 5–10 minutes thinking with your pencil and be ready to share. Be the bridge builder. Be the one who weeds out hidden assumptions by creating alignment.</p><p>Pickup your pencil, and get after it!</p><h3>One More Thing…</h3><p>You may get really frustrated when you spend time and energy understanding the problem and proposing a solution only to have it ripped apart over and over again. Or you may work hard on identifying and rendering the best solution and people tell you all the reasons why it’s wrong. You may get frustrated after months into a project and things suddenly go sideways and your project partners decide that it’s the “wrong” direction.</p><p>It’s a horrible feeling and one of incredible frustration. It might feel like you can never get anything right. But I want you to know: as a designer that’s your job. It’s our job to propose and work through solutions and constantly be searching and rendering our thinking. We make the intangible tangible so people can understand it. You make the intangible tangible so we can build it if that’s the agreed path. If you propose a solution, or many solutions, and people disagree, you’ve done your job. Consider it a success if you draw a picture or prototype and people disagree with it. That’s your opportunity to find alignment and find the path forward.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4d8f661e63f0"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-illusion-of-alignment-4d8f661e63f0"">The illusion of alignment</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Reasons to be optimistic</h4><p>Advancements in AI continue to generate excitement for those in tech and product-focused fields. Coming along for the ride with that excitement is proportionate <a href=""https://www.reach3insights.com/blog/ai-anxiety"">anxiety for many</a>, especially those in UX. New AI advancements and employer expectations raise various concerns that tend to fall under the larger banner of something like “will AI reduce the need for UX designers and researchers?”. <a href=""https://substack.com/home/post/p-162155396"">Thomas Stokes at Drill Bit Labs reports</a> a year-over-year increase of almost 7% in UX job postings mentioning AI. Are User Experience and related fields like Human Factors and Human-Computer Interaction in the early phases of being relegated to the sidelines? While I understand and empathize with this concern, I also believe it is often misplaced. Fundamental economic principles and recent historical patterns suggest something more nuanced and optimistic. The UX workforce is more likely to see its daily job responsibilities and overall market positioning transform and evolve than become outdated and marginalized.</p><p>My goal for this post is simply to offer a few thoughts on the future of UX based on proven economic principles and historical examples I hope will inspire optimism.</p><h3>Foundational economic principles</h3><p>Taking a look at recent economic history, technological advancements have consistently transformed rather than eliminated human work. I will briefly highlight two relevant economic principles to this transformation: Ricardo’s Comparative Advantage and Kremer’s O-ring Theory.</p><p>Comparative Advantage: In 1817 renowned economist David Ricardo demonstrated that even when one side of an economic trade has an <em>absolute</em> advantage in everything they produce, both sides will benefit when each specializes in what they do <em>comparatively</em> better. In other words, even in the extreme hypothetical that an AI agent was better at every UX task than its human counterpart, it would still be more efficient to utilize the AI for <em>only</em> the tasks it has the largest <em>comparative</em> advantage in (and likewise for the human UXer). This principle helps us see how, even as AI capabilities increase, economic forces will create a division of labor between AI and humans rooted in their respective strengths (even in the unlikely, doom-and-gloom scenario in which AI has become absolutely better at <em>everything</em>). Common examples of tasks which AI (particularly GenAI) holds comparative advantage in are structured, repetitive, routine tasks (think spreadsheet math, responding to emails, and the like).</p><figure><img alt=""Picture: Illustrative diagram of Ricardo’s theory of Comparative Advantage"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*W6KRmtzQjk-wr1szDbtmnw.png"" /><figcaption>Generated with Gemini 2.5 (Nano Banana)</figcaption></figure><p>O-ring Theory: Nobel Memorial Prize winning economist Michael Kremer proposed the <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/108/3/551/1881767"">O-ring theory of economic development in 1993</a>. Using the Challenger space shuttle disaster of 1986 as a prime example, O-ring theory shows how a single point of inefficiency in a product team can dramatically impact the success of the end product. For example, even if 9 out of 10 team members do their job with incredible efficiency, a single team member working inefficiently can cause the otherwise high performing team to produce a mediocre product. Applied to our AI and UX context, Kremer’s theory demonstrates that even <em>if</em> we were to efficiently outsource 90% of UX tasks to AI, the relative impact of the human UX designer or researcher would not decrease, but actually increase!</p><p>Takeaway: Comparative Advantage and O-ring theory provide two economic rationales to believe there will always be considerable value to be gained from human UXers, even in the event humanity reaches sci-fi levels of AI capabilities.</p><h3>Historical examples of role transformation</h3><p>Theories and principles are helpful, but let’s turn for a quick look at some historical examples showing what happens when technology automates human tasks.</p><ol><li>Automation and mechanization in manufacturing is a familiar example. When mechanized task automation became the standard manufacturing it did not simply eliminate jobs, but instead bifurcated the market. Yes, mass production was automated and job roles were lost as a result. However, this simultaneously created new demand for artisanal and specialty manufacturing roles. <a href=""https://teamstage.io/jobs-lost-to-automation-statistics/"">It is estimated</a> that in the past 25 years roughly 1.7 million manufacturing jobs have been lost due to automation. However, <a href=""https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299194"">it is also estimated</a> that 133 million new jobs (some, not all, in manufacturing) will be created, many of which will shift from low-skills and low-pay to higher-skilled and higher-paid manufacturing positions.</li><li>The banking industry gives us one of my favorite examples of transformation over elimination. When ATMs became widespread in the 90’s many spoke of the impending doom of the bank teller. The number of ATMs sharply rose from zero to over 400,000 in the course of just a few years, bolstering fears of job loss. Instead, <a href=""https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/813/"">as documented by economist James Bessen</a>, the number of bank tellers in the United States <em>increased</em> at a rate higher than that of the average workforce. ATMs reduced the cost of operating a bank branch, allowing banks to open more branches. Teller responsibilities transformed from handling cash to relationship management and more complex financial services. These were high-value responsibilities that ATMs could not perform at the level of a human or in which humans held the <em>comparative advantage</em>.</li></ol><p>Bessen concludes</p><p><em>“Many people suppose that if technology automates tasks . . . then widespread computer automation must be associated with major job losses. But this view fundamentally misunderstands what has been happening. The evidence shows that computer automation of an occupation is associated with increased demand for that occupation . . . The net result is that computer use is associated with a small increase in employment on average, not major job losses.” (pp.29–30)</em></p><figure><img alt=""A black and white image of an early ATM prototype"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/910/0*EZyolmi_Bz-aWFBP.png"" /></figure><p>3. When thinking of large-scale automation in North America, the agricultural revolution is one of the most dramatic historical examples. Agricultural employment fell from roughly 41% of the U.S. workforce in 1900 to less than 2% today, <a href=""https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299194"">due in large part to technological advances in automation</a>. The end of humans working in agriculture, right? Not quite, as both <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2019/beyond-bls/changes-in-the-us-occupational-mix-from-1860-to-2015.htm"">The Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> and economist <a href=""https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/inline-files/Why%20Are%20there%20Still%20So%20Many%20Jobs_0.pdf"">David Autor</a> note that while traditional agricultural jobs did experience decline, new jobs and responsibilities were created focusing less on physical labor and more on higher-order thinking[8,7]. This is not to mention the significant rise of new jobs and skill sets in other sectors as a result of this market shift.</p><p>4. Lastly, a historical example more directly applicable to what we see happening is UX is the transformation of accounting. As standard bookkeeping has become increasingly automated, <a href=""https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/inline-files/Why%20Are%20there%20Still%20So%20Many%20Jobs_0.pdf"">accountants have evolved </a>into new and sometimes different, or more highly skilled, roles such as strategists, analytics, and advisors. The <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/accountants-and-auditors.htm"">Bureau of Labor Statistics reports</a> employment among accountants has grown and is expected to continue to grow at an above average rate despite automation of many daily tasks. Traditionally trained accountants are increasingly focused on higher-order responsibilities like interpretation, strategy, and personalized financial advice. It is not difficult to see how a similar strategic shift could happen in UX.</p><p>These historical patterns suggest UX may begin to bifurcate into AI-driven standard solutions (e.g., AI generated reports, automated design reviews) and value-add, human-crafted experiences (e.g., strategic research, deep problem solving exercises). This would follow the economic principle of comparative advantage that has a proven track record through many technological revolutions.</p><h3>The current state of AI in UX</h3><p>Today’s AI tools are capable of performing, at varying degrees of effectiveness, different core UX tasks like generating wireframes and prototypes, sketching design concepts, creating synthetic users, moderating 1-on-1 interview sessions, mapping user journeys from qualitative data inputs, drafting moderator guides, analyzing quantitative data, creating research reports, ideating new design directions, and the list goes on.</p><p>However, as we stand today, AI struggles with many other aspects of UX like unique design challenges, cultural and contextual nuance, novel user behaviors, and ethical considerations. <a href=""https://jakobnielsenphd.substack.com/p/ai-can-cannot-do-ux"">Jakob Nielsen comments</a> on some of the current limitations in AI in UX Research,</p><blockquote>“The reason we conduct user research instead of relying solely on the 10 heuristics and other usability guidelines is that humans always have unexpected behaviors. How do we know what people want, need, or prefer? This cannot be predicted, any more than we can predict the future.”</blockquote><p>Perhaps these limitations reflect Ricardo’s principle of comparative advantage at work. AI handles routine tasks along with some creative tasks while humans retain the advantage in other areas of higher-order thinking. I try to avoid making specific predictions about the future, but this seems like a reasonable possibility given what we have seen happen in other technological revolutions.</p><h3>Looking forward</h3><p>I will end by offering a few parting considerations for looking at AI transformation in UX moving forward. UX professionals navigating current advances in AI should consider adopting the lens of tried and true economic principles for guidance. Focus on developing skills where humans maintain <em>comparative</em> advantage. Do not become fixated on the absolute advantages of AI. Focus on core UX skills that make you part of the O-ring of production to multiply your impact on the end product. Focus your energy not solely on displacement, but also on newly created opportunities.</p><p>As bank tellers and accountants embraced evolution in their roles through a changing technological environment, we UX professionals should too — with optimism.</p><p><em>Originally posted on the </em><a href=""https://triuxpa.org/blog/13502155""><em>Triangle UXPA blog</em></a></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=5f9d334aad05"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-economics-of-ai-in-ux-5f9d334aad05"">The economics of AI in UX</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4><em>Today, too many images are little more than filler and bait.</em></h4><p>It feels like almost all text published online today <em>needs </em>an image with it. White paper, blog post, social post, news article: these things must have an image with them to <em>survive — </em>how do you expect your writing to reach people by throwing away all the <a href=""https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/photos-generate-engagement-research/"">engagement that images give you</a>?</p><p>But, obviously it wasn’t always like this. See below an image of the cover of the <em>New York Times</em> on armistice day 1918:</p><figure><img alt=""An photograph of the front page of the New York Times, featuring no images, only text."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zXtVyVNl99j8jZisckx5uw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>And a screenshot from CNN from today, October 11 2025:*1</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of the CNN homepage, featuring a large number of very colorful images."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZTMClsXCpIhaAvYz9uHSnQ.png"" /></figure><p>It wasn’t always like this, and we apparently managed to get information before. It wasn’t perfect, but we managed.</p><h3>What are accessory images?</h3><p>You might be thinking, “But I, or someone I know, sometimes finds these images useful.” Indeed: my disagreement is primarily with images whose nature is not to give you information in themselves, but which act as bait or filler.</p><p>So what are accessory images? Here’s a test: let’s say that an article you have written is being recognized in some way — such as receiving an award, being used for training, etc. Under what circumstances would you include the accompanying image?</p><p>For instance, if your article was about hacking and your editor had added a stock photograph of an unidentified man in a hoodie on a computer, would you submit that image along with the article for recognition by a prize? Or as a materially important part of the article for training purposes?</p><p>Such images — often stock or AI slop (all of which I shall discuss below) — are an insult to the visual crafts like photography and painting. These images don’t matter in themselves; rather they are just there to fill space or draw people to something actually important (or profitable). They are an accessory to the crime of clickbait.</p><p>They thus distort our networks and our information environment:</p><ol><li>The article most read should be the most interesting one, not the one with the most distracting image.</li><li>Conversely, our social networks are today brain-addling filler images whose only characteristic is existing.</li></ol><p>Any medium can be an accessory: images are special to me because they are the normal accessory to my primary medium, text. But so can text be an accessory, as can music: see “stock music” or (trade name) Musak.</p><h3>Careless taste</h3><p>Where are all these images coming from? Apparently, at least one person asked the question: “Now we can easily deliver images over the Internet, where can we put them? Why not have an image with every article on our website, and every preview in our article listing page, and every preview on our social network feed.”</p><p>Of course, it wasn’t long before you need your thing to have a preview/featured image for it to go anywhere online: anything without a featured image will be at disadvantage. Now, images are for the most part <em>compulsory.</em></p><p>This has led to two overlapping phenomena:</p><h4>Slock</h4><p>Slock images are created to fill the gap, they’re usually either stock photography (iStock, Getty, etc.) or AI-generated (slop) — hence “slock.” These images are most popular among stressed-out content managers, writers, and people trying to get somewhere on LinkedIn.</p><p>These people are told — explicitly by managers, or implicitly by the networks, that every piece of writing needs an image. Then begins the panicked process of finding one: note that for any writer paid by the article (not the hour) this wasted time is quite painful.</p><p>This brings forth a rogue’s gallery of trash:</p><p>We have of course the corporate-looking stock, like this mysterious person who pops up everywhere:</p><figure><img alt=""A stock photograph, featuring a person dressed in a suit reading a newspaper, whose title is “Business.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xUf5404HX_-DzQfwHjnTuw.png"" /></figure><p>Then the figures:</p><figure><img alt=""An uncanny-valley figure, a misshapen humanoid with an oversized expressionless head and overly-defined hands, seemingly made from grey plastic."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/621/1*WJB97hrG3RK8OX280z-o1A.png"" /></figure><p>And of course the recent AI slop:</p><figure><img alt=""An AI slop cartoon, featuring animals dressed in suits apparently performing business, and saying nonsensical things."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*MurCiXczBjpVcHcZqGMY4g.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Please note that images of the grade shown above are common on LinkedIn, despite the gibberish.</figcaption></figure><p>Slop is more insidious than stock. Now that people can create images quickly with AI, the problem of finding something relevant is solved, superficially.</p><p>For example, a colleague of mine wrote a good article on “Excel Hell” — Copilot dutifully made him an image of a man standing in a burning room surrounded by floating tables in Excel-brand green.</p><p>Relevant? From the perspective of someone with no concept of a spreadsheet (and therefore of Excel Hell), yes.</p><p>Useful, clarifying, aesthetically pleasing? No, and so lacking in these qualities that it threatens to tear the mind to shreds.</p><p>This comes with uncountable problems, including:</p><ol><li>The disturbing nature of the pictures, and their universally crass and/or cheesy persona</li><li>The environmental impact immense power required to create them (remember that the vast majority of these images are pointless)</li><li>The overproduction of real-enough looking images such that it’s becoming hard to know what’s real</li></ol><h4>Bait</h4><p>As I suggested above, the overabundance of images has turned our media from places where we read and explore and decide what we wish to learn more about, to places where we scroll — barely consciously — browsing until something jolts us enough to pause or click.</p><p>We used to explore, now we doomscroll. In this environment, people obviously use images as a tool to snap people out of it — or deeper into it, depending on your perspective.</p><p>This of course gives us the shock face:</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of a YouTube preview, with the host exhibiting the common “shock” face."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*e6dXlY3vQGRSKHjZVckNPw.png"" /></figure><p>And, with the medium curling back on itself, the fake quote, usually shop sign or imagined book:</p><figure><img alt=""A fabricated quote, made to look as though it were written in a book then highlighted: “Everything in your life is a reflection of a choice you have made. If you want a different result, make a different choice.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/736/1*ijva-XnO3OWqzkKEenjB_w.jpeg"" /></figure><p>As mentioned earlier, there’s a lot of overlap between slock and bait.</p><p>We must demand to know, in all these cases, what we the readers/listeners/watchers gain from this. Were the images and hence gasping faces absent — leaving just the title, account ID and a description — would we all say, “all this needs is someone faking surprise”?</p><h3>Proposals</h3><p>So, what do we do about it? Here are some ideas:</p><h4><strong>Text-only mode (perhaps by default in some cases)</strong></h4><ol><li>All hypertext systems that have a text mode, and should provide a facility for the user to use that mode only, i.e. show text only.</li><li>Users should be able to suppress images <em>ad hoc</em>, or everywhere, at particular times, on particular Internet domains, etc. Ideally, online media would be made to look good without the images.</li><li>One might build, for instance, a text-only social media platform, where images are never shown unless one accesses the particular post where they’re found.</li><li>These settings would be organized as a fractal, with any entity at any level of abstraction capable of setting this parameter.</li><li>For instance, the moderators of a given community on a given social network could set the default setting for the visibility of images, but individual users always have final control.</li></ol><h4><strong>One, the other, or both</strong></h4><ol><li>To dam the production of slock images, publications or we could create a rule something like the following: a post can be previewed either as text (showing the title, author and a snippet) or as image (showing a the title, author, and a thumbnail).</li><li>This way any writer, photographer and publication must make the hard choice: does this image stand alone, or is it merely bait or wallpaper for the accompanying text?</li></ol><p>There is of course the question of what to do with media that has both a legitimate text and image component. I say we create the category, e.g. multimedia feature/comic-book and in such cases preview with an image. This type might have to be prohibited or creatively governed in many freely accessible social media, because it presents the opportunity for skullduggery.</p><p>Accessory media (and particularly images) are a disease of luxury. It’s only because our computers are this powerful and our networks fast that it is even possible.

<h3>Hidden patterns of system behavior</h3><h4>Understanding the feedback loops and recurring designs that govern our lives</h4><figure><img alt=""The Triptych Window from the Coonley Playhouse, Riverside, Illinois. Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/843/0*rbp72C1nJgvzYySI.jpeg"" /><figcaption>A Frank Lloyd Wright Stained Glass Window | source: <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/"">https://www.artic.edu/</a></figcaption></figure><p>Systems don’t behave randomly. They behave based on their design. As a result, many systems, even those found in nature, exhibit frequent, common behaviors. Moreover, these behaviors will typically manifest the same problems and issues, so much so that we may even name and categorize them. These are <a href=""https://ctl.mit.edu/sites/ctl.mit.edu/files/attachments/tab%204c%20Pacheco%20-%20system%20archetypes.pdf"">sometimes called archetypes</a>, but I prefer to call them familiar system mechanisms. For designers they are important to know, recognize, and avoid.</p><p><strong>Why Feedback Matters</strong></p><p><a href=""https://deming.org/systems-thinking-feedback-loops/"">Feedback</a> refers to the way systems communicate with individuals. By providing information about the system state and its performance, feedback enables the individual to make decisions (or evaluate system recommendations). It is perhaps one of the most important aspects of systems design.</p><p>Feedback is critical for building system resilience; when errors occur, a system should give feedback about the error and allow for an immediate response to correct the error.</p><p>Think about the simple act of adjusting your shower water temperature. You turn the handle, stick your hand in the water stream, and receive immediate feedback about whether you need to adjust further. This feedback loop — action, measurement, adjustment — is fundamental to how we interact with systems.</p><figure><img alt=""A feedback diagram representing how feedback influences decisions for shower water temperature."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*HR27BtltXVpGjhVn"" /><figcaption>A feedback diagram for adjusting water temperature Source: Author</figcaption></figure><p>But not all feedback is immediate. And that’s where things get interesting.</p><p><strong>The Power of Recognizing Familiar System Mechanisms</strong></p><p>Recognizing familiar system mechanisms (FSMs) is important for several reasons:</p><p>First, by recognizing them, you can quickly and accurately predict how the system will act. This knowledge enables you to situate yourself in the position of <a href=""https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/"">highest leverage</a> to alter or improve the output of the system, or to use it to your greatest advantage.</p><p>Second, when FSMs fail, they typically fail in a common and familiar way. This particular way is called <a href=""https://asq.org/quality-resources/fmea?srsltid=AfmBOopzD-3sRK4wAdAfwmwwOXuUiXJp_-2VaxrLpbR-RkCUBgF2PEEA"">a failure mode</a>. Correctly recognizing and categorizing an FSM will enable you to prevent and guard against the most common failure modes quickly and with little effort.</p><p>Third, FSMs provide clarity and agency in the face of complexity. Many problems found in life and business are different manifestations of similar system mechanisms. To recognize this is to empower yourself. As Peter Senge writes in “<a href=""https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=DChsSEwiGlPWI0JSQAxUzU38AHRSkLCAYACICCAEQABoCb2E&amp;co=1&amp;ase=2&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwl5jHBhDHARIsAB0YqjyNSZA9FSkzRSfU8oAEkhgyHIC3oYPpCLned0Lsgkmns-hk7TN0RO0aApuIEALw_wcB&amp;cid=CAASN-Ro7p02t7zrIE99lr3KKPQTsiEMmszea3aV6W-dh_yCGmIKxIuUYCampmvLlX_PqknYuAXUK9E&amp;cce=2&amp;category=acrcp_v1_33&amp;sig=AOD64_3gk13R_6gaoEyz9g4bDPS0YncTxg&amp;q&amp;nis=4&amp;adurl&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjypu-I0JSQAxX34ckDHXLUOU4Q0Qx6BAgVEAE""><em>The Fifth Discipline</em></a>:”</p><blockquote><em>“Systems archetypes [FSMs] reveal an elegant simplicity underlying the complexity of management issues. As we learn to recognize more and more of these archetypes, it becomes possible to see more and more places where there is leverage in facing difficult challenges and to explain these opportunities to others.”</em></blockquote><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/658/0*GV5iSBO-7EflsGwM.jpg"" /><figcaption>Cover to the Fifth Discipline by Peter Senge | Source: Amazon.com/</figcaption></figure><p>While Senge’s focus was explicitly on management and business, it’s clear that the same principles apply to other areas of life, even in our personal daily enterprises.</p><p><strong>Three Familiar System Mechanisms You Need to Know</strong></p><p><em>Mechanism #1: Balancing Process with Delay</em></p><p>In this mechanism, an actor adjusts the system controls in response to delayed feedback. If they are not aware that the system has a feedback delay, or misjudges the delay, they will over or under adjust the controls, or become discouraged from lack of change in the controls.</p><p>A shower provides a great example for this. We all know that the controls of the shower are not instantaneous and that the shower has a startup time associated with getting hot water to the showerhead. Because of experience we allow some time for the system (shower controls, plumbing, hand) to register a change before making further adjustments. And yet despite ample experience, we’ve all been surprised by an icy or excessively hot stream of water as we’ve mistakenly adjusted the controls.</p><figure><img alt=""A picture of a man adjusting the shower with a feedback diagram superimposed on top"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*CHgxWUHBUzeN2W44"" /><figcaption>Source: Author</figcaption></figure><p>The lesson to be learned from this type of scenario is that aggressiveness increases risk and volatility. Stock market bubbles are a macro-level phenomenon of the same mechanism at play. Investors see delayed feedback from their actions, panic, and over-correct, creating wild swings in valuation.</p><p>This mechanism shows up everywhere:</p><ul><li>Dieting and weight loss (results take weeks to show)</li><li>Learning new skills (improvement feels slow initially)</li><li>Economic policy (effects take months or years to materialize)</li><li>Exercise routines (strength gains and muscle growth have delayed feedback)</li></ul><p><em>Mechanism #2: Limits to Growth</em></p><p>In this system mechanism, (of which a famous, <a href=""https://www.clubofrome.org/publication/the-limits-to-growth/"">1972 paper was written</a>) the system grows organically, but eventually encounters a limit to continued growth. Actors within the system may be tempted to ignore early signs of the limit to growth or discount it as trivial because of the current success. As the limit goes unaddressed, growth continues to slow. The way for the system to continue to grow is to remove the limit.</p><p>In the NBC sitcom, <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/"">The Office</a>, Michael Scott starts his own paper company to compete against his former employer, Dunder Mifflin. By undercutting prices, he steals away Dunder Mifflin’s customers, but as he looks to expand his business, he’s confronted by a startling reality: the prices that are making him successful are also putting him out of business.</p><figure><img alt=""A picture from the NBC sitcom the office, featuring Michael Scott, Pam, and Ryan"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*OzCQzbnur4hIZLrP"" /><figcaption>The Michael Scott Paper Company, in it’s heyday. Source: Reddit.com/</figcaption></figure><p>The lesson of this mechanism is to address limitations early to avoid roadblocks later.</p><p><em>Mechanism #3: Tragedy of the Commons</em></p><p>In the <a href=""https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/tragedy-of-the-commons-impact-on-sustainability-issues"">tragedy of the commons</a>, actors within a system all have access to shared but limited resources. They use this resource for their individual needs, and since the resource is free to them, they benefit from its use. As more people become aware of the free, beneficial resource, more people start using it, and the advantage diminishes until it is obliterated.</p><p>Nobel Prize winner Thomas Schelling explains in “<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Micromotives-Macrobehavior-Thomas-C-Schelling/dp/0393329461""><em>Macromotives and Microbehavior</em></a>”:</p><blockquote><em>“‘The commons’ has come to serve as a paradigm for situations in which people so impinge on each other in pursuing their own interests that collectively they might be better off if they could be restrained, but no one gains individually by self-restraint.”</em></blockquote><figure><img alt=""A diagram which explains the tragedy of the commons"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/936/0*5W7BOhTsKTJpgHvJ.png"" /><figcaption>The Tragedy of the Commons Source: sustainable-environment.org/</figcaption></figure><p>Colleagues sharing a drive at work to backup your computer is one manifestation of the familiar mechanism, as is what happens when too many devices are playing at once on the home Wi-Fi. Or when <a href=""https://dpericich.medium.com/how-to-get-around-netflixs-new-household-policy-d2c41fa8ffd5"">Netflix calls you out for using the service in too many locations.</a></p><p>The lesson of this familiar system mechanism is to recognize the “commons” and create some level of <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/one-among-many/201911/escaping-the-tragedy-of-the-commons"">self-regulation or peer-monitoring</a> to ensure the common resource remains useful for all.</p><p><strong>The Role of Systems in Decision-Making</strong></p><p>Systems do not just have an overriding impact on human behaviors but also have an oversized impact on <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/timabansal/2025/07/11/how-systems-thinking--helps-leaders-avoid-bad-decisions/"">the way we frame problems, evaluate choices, and make decisions</a>.</p><p>One of the best demonstrations of this comes from the popular 2008 book “<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/014311526X""><em>Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness</em></a><em>.</em>” Authors Richard Thaler (Another Nobel Prize Winner) and Cass Sunstein make it clear that the way decisions are made has a lot more to do with the context and systems that surround the decision than the person’s own preferences or free will.</p><figure><img alt=""The cover to Nudge by Richard Thaler"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*AmfgYhAdxS0rSony.jpg"" /><figcaption>Nudge, a book about the roll of systems on decision making | Source: Amazon.com/</figcaption></figure><p>The book is full of quotes that testify to the reality of the impact systems have on human behavior, including decision making:</p><blockquote><em>“People have a strong tendency to go along with the status quo or default option.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“First, never underestimate the power of inertia. Second, that power can be harnessed.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“The first misconception is that it is possible to avoid influencing people’s choices.”</em></blockquote><p>Their main point is critically important: behavior is impacted by systems.</p><p><strong>Why This Matters for Your Life</strong></p><p>We do not make our decisions in a vacuum. This is neither a good thing nor a bad thing. Our interaction with the environments and systems around us constrain and limit our decisions and behaviors. With this awareness, we give ourselves greater personal and individual agency.</p><p>Recognizing the patterns that make up FSMs helps simplify complexity, predict outcomes, and identify leverage points for meaningful change. Rather than reacting blindly to problems, understanding FSMs enables smarter, more strategic responses.</p><p>Whether it’s designing better personal habits, improving workplace processes, or simply understanding why certain patterns keep repeating in your life, recognizing these familiar mechanisms gives you the power to work with the system rather than against it.</p><p>The feedback loops are always there. The patterns are always present.

It’s judgment.</em></h4><figure><img alt=""A photo-realistic image of an art studio wall with about a dozen charcoal drawings of figures and drapery pinned for critique, lit by moody fluorescent light with soft shadows."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SCdoTVV0fHpJ6XgbMV1OgA.png"" /><figcaption>Composite AI-created image by author</figcaption></figure><p>There’s that word again. Taste.</p><p>Listen to a few podcasts with designer A talking to designer B in echo chamber C, and you’ll likely hear it a few more times.</p><p><a href=""https://carlbarenbrug.com/taste-matters?ref=sidebar"">We’re talking about taste </a>like it’s the thing that will keep the cyber robots from stealing away our jobs.</p><p>It’s not that I disagree. But I think once again we’ve rushed out of our way to promote <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/the-broken-rhetoric-of-ai-f3a24165899d"">exactly the wrong word</a> to convey what we really mean.</p><h3>Where do I start?</h3><p>When I hear the word <em>taste</em>, I often think about fashion.</p><p>Somebody who dresses well is often considered to have great taste, but what does that really mean? Is it something born within us, or is it developed over time?</p><p>Despite deep respect for people with good fashion sense, there’s a truth that often floats above the mystique of someone’s innate ability to look sharp:</p><blockquote>To dress well is to dress appropriately.</blockquote><p>In other words, forethought to context (e.g. an incoming rainstorm) often plays a part in the senses people see in us.</p><p>When we talk about having taste during our collective AI <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development"">storming and norming</a> phase <em>(to borrow from Tuckman’s group development model)</em>, I know we’re talking about something similar.</p><p>But it also takes time, which leads to experience, which leads to judgment and arbitration — the real words we mean when we talk about taste in this context.</p><h3>Fade to gray</h3><p>When I was in art school, we used to have some bang-out critiques — some real barn burners, if you want to know. Unlike my business-credit-taking dorm buddies, fine art studio sessions were often three-hour jams that culminated in everyone hanging up their work for stark and uncomfortable examination.</p><p>We learned techniques from <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/standing-in-the-shadow-of-giotto-43d0133cfea2"">the old masters</a> to create wonderful studies of light and shadow on objects, scenes, and eventually the human figure, culminating with ourselves in portrait.</p><p>We used sandpaper to sprinkle charcoal dust on heavy paper, creating a mid-tone canvas for adding light with a chamois and a series of erasers. Then darkening with more charcoal, finding and building our tolerance for shape, mood, and eventually meaning.</p><p><em>Pro tip: The secret to finding shadows is simply squinting your eyes.</em></p><p>Regardless of the subject, there was always a time requirement. We were expected to put an hour into our first take-home assignments. Then two. Then three. Then eventually six.</p><p>Six!? Everyone outside of the art program scoffed at this labor-intensive task.</p><p>Once the work was ready to present, my professor — a perky and passionate painter with a Texas drawl — would start at the far left of the wall and make her way across, pointing and smiling at each piece before a word was even spoken.</p><p>She always, without fail, asked the same question starting each student’s critique.</p><h3><em>How many hours?</em></h3><p><em>How many hours? How many hours? How many hours, y’all?</em></p><p>We’d all wait until a fellow student chimed in, giving a rough estimate based on the work in front of us.</p><p><em>Looks more like one to me.</em></p><p>Invariably, the artist would cave — admit to an all-nighter at Blue House or some downtown bar, then finding only a spare 20 minutes over a hungover weekend to throw together a passable representation.</p><p>This admission was necessary because it was always obvious in contrast to the other work. The output always told the story.</p><p>Time is evident in craft. What we put into it is usually what we get out of it.</p><p>What I learned in those classes informs me to this day.</p><p>Quality isn’t automatic. It’s nurtured through time, technique, and feedback from others who are willing to tell us what they see in our own work.</p><p>It’s a process of discovering and defining <a href=""https://articles.centercentre.com/driving-product-teams-to-become-more-design-mature/"">what <em>good</em> looks like</a>. And it comes over time, which is necessary for knowing how our work is received relative to the unforgiving forum of mass perception.</p><p>Compare this with today’s AI slop and the absurd notion of “Look what I did with X number of prompts” — it starts to feel like an oxymoron.</p><p>The idea that <em>taste</em> is the antidote to bad AI decisions simplifies a much more <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/design-is-a-conversation-2af15b555c80"">nuanced conversation</a>.</p><p>And that’s why I think <em>taste</em> isn’t the right word. It’s too foofy.</p><p>Not to mention that in 25 years of doing UX and product design, I’ve never heard a user express any appreciation for the <em>taste</em> of a particular design— let alone the designer. Seldom are products elevated at the surface level that word immediately conjures.</p><h3>In other words</h3><p>What we’re really reaching for isn’t taste. It’s a strong <a href=""https://productpicnic.beehiiv.com/p/taste-is-a-dead-end"">point of view</a>, shaped by memory, practice, and a willingness to stay in the work long enough to know what matters.</p><p>That’s our goal. And it hasn’t really changed.</p><p>Businesses will always want output that’s better, faster, and cheaper.</p><p>But generative AI? I see it more like the charcoal and the eraser — not the finished piece.</p><p>It can help us block in the basics. It might even suggest a direction or tease out a shape we hadn’t seen before. But <em>we</em> should be the ones squinting to see what’s there. AI can’t choose what to leave out, or where to press harder. It doesn’t know when to stop, when to share, or when to start over.</p><p>That’s not subjective taste. That’s practiced judgment.</p><p>And judgment only comes from showing up again and again — building tolerance for ambiguity, seeking critique, and developing the context to make decisions with intent.</p><p>So maybe the next time we reach for “taste” as the thing that separates us from the machine, we take a beat.</p><p>What we really mean is more nuanced.</p><p>What we’re trying to say is: <em>I’ve been here before. I know what good looks like. And I know what to do next — because I’ve put in the hours.</em></p><p>It’s not taste that makes the difference.</p><p>It’s time well spent.</p><h3>Keep in touch</h3><p>If this resonated with you, <a href=""https://medium.com/@mschindler"">follow me</a> on <strong>Medium</strong> for more stories about staying grounded in today’s design culture.</p><p>Find me on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mschindler"">LinkedIn</a> or my personal website, <a href=""http://mschindler.com/"">mschindler.com</a>.</p><p>Related reading:</p><p><a href=""https://www.doc.cc/syntax/taste"">Taste</a></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=b5caacddbec4"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-importance-of-taste-and-other-lies-we-tell-ourselves-b5caacddbec4"">The importance of taste, and other lies we tell ourselves</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11935639.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>This week begins with a wave of beauty, balance, and intention-setting as the New Moon in Libra arrives on October 21, opening up a 10-day portal to re-center and recalibrate. The New Moon is ruled by <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-libra-horoscope-october-2025-meaning-effects"">Venus, who’s just come home to Libra</a>, adding a layer of divine ease and elegance to the cosmic weather. Think of this lunation as your official invitation to simplify your life, clear emotional clutter, and call in relationships that reflect your growth, not your patterns. Even if the world feels chaotic, this is a window where the inner world can start to feel a little more in rhythm — one breath at a time. <br /><br />But don’t get too comfy, because the next day, on the 22nd, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/libra-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Libra Season</a> ends, and on the 23rd, the depths of Scorpio Season rise up to meet us. That shift alone — from Air to Water, from surface to soul, from curation to catharsis — is a reminder that life moves in layers. We’re at a threshold, a moment between what’s light and what’s heavy, and the astrology this week is here to teach us that we don’t have to pick one or the other. We can live and let live, love and let love, <em>and</em> still honor the shadows that live within us. This isn’t a week of either/or. It’s both/and. <br /><br />And here’s the plot twist: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars, Scorpio’s ancient ruler, is also in Scorpio</a>, intensifying our instincts, sharpening our focus, and stirring our deepest desires. When both Venus and Mars are in their home signs, it’s like the divine feminine and divine masculine are having a private convo about where we’re really headed. Passion meets poise, truth meets tenderness, and we’re being asked to integrate it all. The version of you who craves connection and harmony gets to co-exist with the one who’s finally ready to stop pretending and speak from the soul. </p>



<p>Also on October 22, Neptune retrogrades back into Pisces at 5:51am EST for its final visit to its home sign — a placement it’s held since July 2011. That’s 14 years of dreaming, dissolving, romanticizing, escaping, and sometimes deceiving ourselves. So let’s pause here: <em>What were you longing for in 2011 that still lingers in the background of your life today? What illusions have been too sweet to let go of? What delusions have actually protected you, and which ones are now blocking your growth?</em> Neptune’s final retrograde through Pisces is here to help us differentiate between being delulu and finding the solulu, and that lesson is as spiritual as it is sobering. <br /><br />And it’s not just personal… this retrograde affects us on a collective level, too. With Saturn also recently re-entering Pisces, and the North Node currently transiting Pisces (until 2026), there’s a massive wave of Piscean energy shaping our intuition, our ideals, and our imaginations. That means questioning media narratives, cultural myths, and the stories we’ve been spoon-fed. It means trusting your gut, even when the facts aren’t clear. And above all, it means reclaiming your spiritual sovereignty. The answers don’t always arrive through logic — sometimes they live in a poem, a dream, a flash of insight, or the moment your body relaxes for the first time in days. <br /><br />This week is about trusting the quiet truth inside you, even if you’re still figuring out how to name it. It’s okay to change your mind. It’s okay to want solitude one minute and to feel wildly social the next. Conversations will be both hilarious and profound — the kind that make you laugh until you cry and cry until you laugh again. And the more grace you offer yourself through this integration process, the more you’ll be able to offer it to others. We’re all riding this wave together. No one’s doing it perfectly. </p>



<p>So lean into the beauty. Let yourself desire peace. But don’t be afraid to feel the edges of your longing, too. Let the Libra New Moon remind you that healing doesn’t always look like shadow work — sometimes it’s a playlist, a pretty dress, a flirty glance, or the moment you decide to forgive yourself for being human. And let Scorpio Season’s arrival remind you that transformation can be tender, and it’s okay if you’re not ready to share the full story just yet. You’re allowed to evolve quietly.<br /><br />Because this week? It could all be so simple — and it gets to be. <br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>You’ve been pretending not to care, Aries, but the Libra New Moon on October 21st is calling your bluff. It’s happening in your partnership sector, and with Venus also in Libra, it’s time to admit that yes, you want softness. You want connection. You want someone who sees you and doesn’t flinch. Whether you’re in a relationship, navigating a situationship, or feeling completely solo — this lunation wants you to pause and check in: <em>What kind of love are you calling in?</em> You get to rewrite your expectations and begin again. It’s okay to let yourself want more: more harmony, more depth, more reciprocity. That doesn’t make you weak; it makes you wise.<br /><br />Then, two days later, the vibe shifts completely as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/10/10719292/scorpio-season-october-2021-meaning-effects"">Scorpio Season</a> begins on the 23rd, lighting up your sector of merging, intimacy, and long-term investments. This is about more than sex (though, yes, that too). This is about legacy. About who you’re building with. About what you’re merging your energy, resources, and soul with and why. With Mars, your ruling planet, in Scorpio, you’re operating with more instinct and intuition than usual. You’re not showing all your cards. You’re observing, planning, feeling more private, and more potent. That can feel disorienting for a Fire sign, but it’s medicine. Let your decisions simmer. Reassess how you spend your energy and who you trust with your heart, your body, your secrets. Scorpio Season is about power, not performance. </p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, your body knows. Your spirit knows. Your routines know. This week’s Libra New Moon on October 21st is like a soft reset for your wellness, work, and rhythm sector, and it’s reminding you that healing isn’t supposed to feel like punishment. It’s supposed to feel like <em>alignment</em>. That means going to bed at a decent hour, turning your phone off an hour before sleep, choosing ginger tea over scrolling, and saying “no” without guilt. With Venus, your ruling planet, also in Libra, this is your chance to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-libra-horoscope-october-2025-meaning-effects"">romanticize your wellness</a>. Make your water fancy. Play jazz while you fold clothes. Eat your snacks before 8pm. You already know what needs tweaking — this lunation just gives you permission to actually <em>do it</em>. And yes, small changes count. <br /><br />But then the tempo changes: Scorpio Season begins October 23, activating your relationship sector and inviting you into the realm of real connection. And not the Instagram kind — the deep, soul-mirroring, “why are you in my dreams” kind. With Mars also in Scorpio, your desire for depth in partnership is doubled. It’s cinematic and intense. You may find yourself magnetically pulled toward people with Scorpio placements, or just craving more <em>presence</em> from the people already in your life. But the challenge? Don’t lose yourself in the sauce. Remember your rituals. Stay rooted in your values. You don’t have to prove you’re lovable. You just have to be present. </p>

<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>This Libra New Moon on October 21st is a love letter to your inner child, Gemini. It’s a fresh start in your creativity, romance, and play sector, and it wants you to do what actually feels good. Remember hobbies? Remember flirting for fun? Remember making things just because you felt like it? That’s what this lunation is about. Venus in Libra is also holding your hand, reminding you that ease can be productive. That joy is part of your path, and that laughter heals. This week, say yes to the dance class, the art project, the silly text, the cartoon rewatch, the solo karaoke in your bathroom mirror. Give your inner child the wheel for a bit. They know the way. <br /><br />Then, once Scorpio Season begins on October 23, your energy gets more serious — but in a helpful way. Scorpio lights up your sector of wellness, habits, and systems, and Mars in Scorpio gives you the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-improve-focus"">power to focus</a>. You’re not just dabbling anymore. You’re getting your sh*t together. And yes, that might feel a little overwhelming at first — the structure, the schedule, the responsibility — but it’s so necessary. Think of this as your season of refinement. What systems do Future You need in place? What boundaries? What daily rituals? Treat discipline as a form of devotion, not restriction. You’re not doing this to limit yourself — you’re doing it to <em>free yourself</em>. </p>

<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You can’t decorate over a wound, Cancer. This week’s Libra New Moon on October 21st lands in your home, healing, and inner foundation sector, and it’s gently guiding you to tend to what’s beneath the surface. Maybe that means rearranging your room so it feels more like a sanctuary. Maybe it means having a long <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/talking-to-family-relationship-disapproval"">talk with a family member</a>. Maybe it means journaling the thoughts you usually keep hidden. This isn’t about appearances — it’s about <em>alignment</em>. With Venus also in Libra, you’re supported in creating beauty and balance where things have felt off-kilter. Let this lunation be a reset for your nervous system. You’re allowed to begin again, even if you never got the apology. Especially if you didn’t.<br /><br />Then comes the glow-up: Scorpio Season kicks off October 23, activating your sector of joy, pleasure, romance, and creativity for the next four weeks. This is your permission slip to <em>feel yourself</em>. To flirt, to play, to create. With Mars also in Scorpio, your sensuality is magnetized, but so is your creativity. You’re not just craving fun, you’re craving depth <em>within</em> fun. Art that moves you, love that consumes you, moments that feel like magic. Just don’t forget: the muse needs rest, too. Protect your energy, and your intuition. The next four weeks are about remembering what brings you back to life and refusing to settle for anything less. </p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The Libra New Moon on October 21st is a social, stimulating reset for you, Leo. It’s lighting up your communication, curiosity, and connection zone. Conversations flow easier this week, and you may find yourself reaching out to people you’ve been meaning to text back since… August. With Venus also in Libra, charm comes naturally to you (yes, even more than usual). You could be asked to collaborate, speak, teach, or write something that finally gets your ideas the attention they deserve. Say yes to anything that feels light, exciting, and reciprocal. This lunation wants you to remember that words are spells, so choose the ones that align with where you’re headed, not where you’ve been. <br /><br />Once Scorpio Season begins on October 23rd, the vibe shifts inward. Your attention turns toward your home, your emotional safety, and your sense of belonging. It’s less about how you’re <em>perceived</em> and more about how you <em>feel</em> when the lights are off and no one’s watching. With Mars also in Scorpio, family dynamics, domestic decisions, or living arrangements may need attention. But instead of reacting, try responding. Scorpio Season is about moving from pride to presence. About anchoring yourself in the small, sacred rituals that keep your heart steady. Decorate your space. Reconnect with your roots. Make home feel like peace again. </p>

<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, this week’s Libra New Moon on October 21st is whispering “stability” — not in a boring way, but in the “let’s actually feel safe in our bodies and our money again” kind of way. It lands in your finance and self-worth zone, encouraging you to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2025"">treat your energy like currency</a>. Where are you investing your time, your attention, your money, your heart? Do those investments still align with your values? With Venus also in Libra, you’re being guided to reconnect with the pleasure of abundance — not hustle for it. Maybe that looks like budgeting with grace, paying yourself first, or simply believing you’re allowed to receive without overexplaining. This lunation wants you to see yourself as the asset.<br /><br />Then, Scorpio Season begins on October 23rd, shifting your attention to your communication and learning sector. You’re not just observing anymore — you’re analyzing, processing, and saying the things that others are too scared to. With Mars in Scorpio, your words carry weight, and your intuition about people is almost eerie. Don’t use that power to overthink or prove yourself — use it to connect. Journal your thoughts. Have the difficult conversation. Take the class or trip that’s been calling to you. Your mind is a portal right now. Speak from the heart, and it’ll reach exactly who it needs to. </p>

<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>We’ve made it to <em>your</em> annual new moon week, Libra, and it’s one of the most beautiful cosmic resets of the year. On October 21st, both the Sun and Moon meet in your sign, with your ruler Venus also cozy at home in Libra. Translation? This is a full permission slip to live and let live, love and let love. You don’t have to earn peace; you can choose it. You’re not being superficial for wanting beauty or harmony — you’re remembering that those things heal you. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-zodiac-sign-2025"">Set intentions</a> that celebrate who you’re becoming rather than fixating on who you used to be. This lunation is a mirror moment. Look closely. You’ve grown more than you realize. <br /><br />By October 23rd, when the Sun slides into Scorpio, the tone deepens — and your focus turns to your values, resources, and inner self-worth. You might notice where you’ve been over-giving, or where your generosity hasn’t been matched. Don’t spiral… Just rebalance. With Mars in Scorpio, it’s time to get practical about your goals. Where do you want to build lasting stability? What’s worth your emotional bandwidth? Scorpio Season helps you refine what “abundance” really means to you. Sometimes, it’s money. Sometimes, it’s peace. This next chapter teaches you how to protect both. </p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio Season begins this week, babe! You can feel it coming, can’t you? But before we get there, the Libra New Moon on October 21st feels like the inhale before the exhale — a quiet clearing in your healing, rest, and reflection zone. You may crave solitude more than usual, and that’s not isolation… it’s preparation. With Venus also in Libra, your soul is recalibrating before the spotlight returns to you. This week’s new moon wants you to release the pressure to do everything at once. Rest is the ritual, closure is the work, and forgiveness is the reset. Give yourself the stillness your spirit’s been asking for, and watch how naturally the inspiration flows back in. <br /><br />Then, on October 23rd, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2024-meaning-effects"">it’s officially </a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2024-meaning-effects"">your</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2024-meaning-effects""> season, Scorpio</a>. The Sun enters your sign, and so does the main character energy. With Mars, your ancient ruler, also here, your magnetism skyrockets. You’re bold without trying, mysterious without forcing it, and on some level… people just <em>know</em> not to play with you right now. But with that power comes a choice: will you lead with love or control? This next four-week chapter is about mastering your intensity — not dimming it. Say what you want, own what you desire, and move like you’ve already shed what needed to go. It’s transformation season, and you’re the divine template. </p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The Libra New Moon on October 21st lands in your community and social goals sector, Sagittarius — and it’s giving “soft launch your reinvention” energy. This is the moment to remember you’re allowed to be known in new ways. You may feel drawn to refresh your brand, update your online presence, or pitch that creative idea that’s been living in your Notes app. With Venus also in Libra, friendship becomes a love language — so lean into the joy of collaboration and platonic intimacy. Whether it’s scheduling a girls’ night, finding a new creative crew, or saying “yes” to something that terrifies you <em>just a little</em>, this is a portal to deeper alignment. Don’t ghost your future self. <br /><br />By October 23rd, when Scorpio Season begins, your mood turns reflective. This is your annual “soul sabbatical” — when the Sun illuminates your closure, subconscious, and healing zone. You may feel more sensitive or sleepy than usual, especially with Mars in Scorpio intensifying your dreams and instincts. Use this time to untangle what you’ve been carrying that isn’t yours. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/casual-relationship-rules-boundaries"">Set boundaries with the energy drainers</a>. Tend to your inner world like it’s your most sacred altar. The magic of this season isn’t loud — it’s hidden, behind-the-scenes, preparing you to rise again in late November. For now, rest <em>is</em> productivity. </p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The Libra New Moon on October 21st is blessing your career and visibility sector, Capricorn, and it’s your cosmic cue to step into the spotlight — but on your own terms. What do you <em>really</em> want to be known for? Who do you feel called to become? This lunation, with Venus also in Libra, helps you approach your ambition from a place of harmony and alignment, rather than grind and guilt. Pitch the bold idea, apply for the role, speak up in the meeting. It’s not about proving anything — it’s about <em>remembering</em> what you bring to the table. You’re building a legacy. Let this new moon reflect that.<br /><br />When the Sun enters Scorpio on October 23rd, the energy pivots toward your friendships, networks, and long-term dreams. Suddenly <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dating-relationship-connection-vs-compatibility"">you’re craving connection</a> — but not the surface-level kind. With Mars also in Scorpio, you’re being guided to deepen your bonds or lovingly release what’s no longer aligned. This season helps you call in your soul tribe — the people who see your power and remind you of your softness. Whether you’re building something new, joining a cause, or just having a long-overdue heart-to-heart with a friend, Scorpio Season is your reminder: success is sweeter when it’s shared. </p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, the Libra New Moon on October 21st arrives with lightness and lift — activating your exploration, truth, and belief sector. It wants you to zoom out. To remember that life isn’t only about responsibilities and goals, but also about adventure, serendipity, and soul expansion. This is a beautiful week to plan a trip, take a course, or follow a philosophical rabbit hole that intrigues you. With Venus also in Libra, you might even fall for someone with a different background or worldview. This lunation is about freedom. Say yes to what expands your heart, and say no to what keeps you small. <br /><br />Once Scorpio Season kicks off on October 23rd, your focus shifts to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/career-horoscope-2025"">your career, reputation, and long-term impact</a>. With Mars in Scorpio, your drive to succeed sharpens, but so does your tendency to burn out if you’re not being honest about what success <em>means</em> to you. Scorpio Season asks you to build more than just your resume. It asks you to build trust. Build truth. Build something that won’t crumble when things get hard. Keep your vision, but let go of the masks. The real you? That’s the version the world’s been waiting for. </p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The Libra New Moon on October 21st is an intimate one for you, Pisces… it takes place in your sector of merging, transformation, and shared resources, which means you may be reflecting on the emotional (and financial) ties in your life. Who are you sharing your energy with, and why? This lunation, paired with Venus’ current transit in Libra, helps you navigate these waters with grace, honesty, and softness. Whether you’re deepening a relationship, releasing an entanglement, or calling in a more balanced dynamic, the message is clear: don’t settle for anything that doesn’t feel <em>sacred</em>. You’re worthy of depth that doesn’t drain you.<br /><br />By October 23rd, when the Sun enters Scorpio, the mood lifts slightly — but it also gets <em>real</em>. This is your annual call to expand, both spiritually and literally. With Mars in Scorpio, your curiosity is on fire. You’re craving truth, adventure, and deeper meaning. Whether it’s planning a spiritual retreat, writing your truth, or diving into metaphysical studies, Scorpio Season activates your philosopher mode. But it’s not about escaping. It’s about understanding the hidden patterns that guide your life. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-is-intuition-psychic-spiritual-meaning"">Let your intuition lead you</a> somewhere that pleasantly surprises you and helps you expand your possibilities. </p>

It’s finally time for Target’s annual designer collaboration, and this one stands out from its most recent slate, like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/target-kate-spade-collaboration-shop"">Kate Spade</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/target-diane-von-furstenberg-collaboration-lookbook"">DVF</a>. This time, the reader-favorite retailer has partnered with the nearly 200-year-old <a href=""https://www.woolrich.com/us/en/"">outdoor lifestyle brand Woolrich</a> on an ultra-cozy, adventure-ready, and dare we say: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPzeJaZk-pX/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA=="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">lumberjack-chic collection</a>. <br /><br />Beyond buffalo-check womenswear and menswear — which Woolrich popularized — you can fully embrace your adventurous side out on the trails or in your humble abode with a range of Target-exclusive accessories, homeware, outdoor gear, and food and drinks. Think: <a href=""http://goto.target.com/55rXmn"">landscape-printed fleece zip-ups</a>, <a href=""http://goto.target.com/GKWAoE"">sheep-covered pillows</a>, <a href=""http://goto.target.com/EEB5GX"">binoculars</a>, and new <a href=""http://goto.target.com/2aDGXD"">maple syrup Kodiak pancake mix</a>.  So while Woolrich’s high-quality and durable apparel may typically cost you a pretty penny, this Target collaboration makes the heritage brand’s designs (and expanded categories) more accessible to a broader audience — with most price points falling under $40.<br /><br />“Woolrich x Target is all about fashion meeting function to help consumers embrace the outdoors in style,"" said Jill Sando, Target's executive vice president and chief merchandising officer, apparel &amp; accessories, home and hardlines in a press release. ""From the <a href=""http://goto.target.com/e1zOBg"">Quilted Sheep Tote Bag</a> to the <a href=""http://goto.target.com/mOMDrD"">Buffalo Check Outdoor Wearable Throw</a>, to the amazing <a href=""http://goto.target.com/jebM2a"">inflatable kayak</a>, and so much more, I love how Target and Woolrich have worked together to create something that's fun and affordable.""<br /><br />The classic utilitarian aesthetics and functional features get a playful Target spin à la vibrant colorways, playful sheep graphics, printed reversible styles, and even a campaign shot in New York to show how Woolrich’s designs can translate into “modern urban style.” So whether you break up your buffalo check ""Pennsylvania tuxedo” with a graphic tee, cargo pants, or quilted skirt, you’ll look and feel confident taking on camping sites <em>or</em> bustling crowds. <br /><br />Woolrich’s creative director, Heekyun Kim, said in the release: ""This collaboration with Target represents an exciting opportunity to introduce our iconic designs, like our legendary buffalo check, to a new generation of explorers.

<p><em>Welcome to</em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/money-diary""><em> Money Diaries</em></a><em> where we are tackling the ever-present taboo that is money. We’ve partnered with</em><a href=""https://www.klarna.com/us/""><em> Klarna</em></a><em>, the financial services company that offers the</em><a href=""https://www.klarna.com/us/klarna-card/""><em> Klarna Card</em></a><em> that can be used two ways — as a traditional debit card anywhere Visa and virtual payments are accepted, or as a flexible pay-later option — allowing its users to feel empowered and in control of their spending. </em></p>



<p><em>Today: </em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ayanahyman""><em>Ayana Hyman</em></a><em>, a 23-year-old Los Angeles-based content creator, uses her Klarna Card to buy essentials like groceries (adulting!) and little things that make her happy.</em></p>



<h2>Day One</h2>



<p>9 a.m. — My alarm clock goes off. I immediately hit snooze and sleep for another hour. Classic. I eventually peel myself out of bed at 10 a.m. and then I remember: I live in Los Angeles now(!!), and that gets me hyped for the day. Moving here has been my dream for forever, and even though I’m all settled in now (I moved a couple months ago), it still feels surreal. </p>



<p>10:30 a.m. — I wash the crust out of my eyes and do my morning skincare routine while bumping to my favorite tunes. I absolutely have to start the day with music pumping through my veins — it’s my way of grounding myself in a new city that honestly still <em>feels</em> new.</p>



<p>1:15 p.m. — I go to my favorite torture class — pilates — and sweat outrageously for an hour. I’ve actually met some of my new friends here. Moving to a new city can be lonely, and it’s been a challenge putting myself out there, so it feels good to start recognizing some familiar faces. <strong>$40 </strong></p>



<p>2:15 p.m. — I grab a container of mangoes — definitely a little pricey, but they make my day every time. Worth it. <strong>$15</strong></p>



<p>6 p.m. — I have a random craving for BBQ, so I order some and it <em>bussed zownnn</em> (as it should for 86 whole dollars!!). Did it taste like comfort? Absolutely.<strong> $86</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $141</strong></p>



<h2>Day Two</h2>



<p>11 a.m. — I start my day with a morning croissant and matcha that I order straight to my door. Matcha is definitely a <em>non-negotiable </em>on heavy editing days. I’ve been a content creator for four years now, and I’ve learned that little treats, like matcha, are just the thing I need to keep going. <strong>$30 </strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — It’s a full hair wash day today: washing, blow drying, and braiding, which kind of feels like the Hair Olympics. I blast music and chat with my mom, which makes the time go by much faster.</p>



<p>5 p.m. — Finally done and I reward myself with a home-cooked meal of chicken, potatoes, and crab claws. It’s a weird combination of dishes, I know, but comfort food always reminds me of home back in Atlanta.  </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $30</strong></p>



<h2>Day Three</h2>



<p>7:30 a.m.  — It’s an early start today because I’m going to a workout class with the girlies I met at pilates. Yay for new friends.</p>



<p>10:30 a.m. — I’m a sucker for cute workout clothes and the workout studio has the <em>CAY-UTEST</em> top. I buy it, of course. <strong>$30</strong></p>



<p>1 p.m. — After our workout, we all get lunch. I only order one smoothie and a croissant, and somehow that’s $30, but I guess that’s LA for ya. I’m still learning how to manage my money out here (social spending versus staying home), but these little hangs definitely make the city feel less lonely. <strong>$30</strong></p>



<p>4:30 p.m. — I spend the afternoon editing content I’ve been procrastinating on. It’s just been sitting in my phone for weeks (oops). I eat a freezer dinner and decide to call it a day. Welcome to the unglamorous side of content creation. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $60</strong></p>



<h2>Day Four</h2>



<p>12 p.m. — I have a brand dinner tonight, and I spend the entire morning thinking about my outfit. When I have something to look forward to, my brain can only think of that one thing for the rest of the day.</p>



<p>3 p.m. — I don’t need to leave until 6:30 p.m., but I start getting ready now, because I’m a professional dilly-dallier. The earlier I get ready the better, because I don’t want to be late — tonight’s event is with one of my favorite Black-owned beauty brands.</p>



<p>6:45 p.m. — Told you! I’m finally ready and leave for dinner. The event is <em>stunning</em>. Moments like these remind me of why I moved out here. I’m living the life I’ve always imagined.  </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $0</strong></p>



<h2>Day Five </h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937459.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>12 p.m.— I get dressed to go to the nail salon — only for them to turn me away because they’re all booked for the day (cue the dramatic <em>nooooo</em>). </p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — Instead of heading home, I take myself on a solo movie date. In Atlanta, I would be hanging out with my sisters or friends. Sometimes being alone feels a bit harder in a new city, but I’m learning to enjoy my own company. And this beats doing chores, so I don’t regret my decision at all. <strong>$43</strong></p>



<p>7 p.m. — I end the night by FaceTiming with my mom, aka my long-distance bestie. I always feel lighter after chats with her. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $43</strong></p>



<h2>Day Six</h2>



<p>2 p.m. — It’s Self-care Saturday. Translation: bed-rotting and doom-scrolling for hours. Sometimes you just need to do nothing. </p>



<p>4:30 p.m. — If I want to make it to the next day, I’m going to need some food in my house, so off to the grocery store we go, where I buy ingredients for a few recipes I have in mind, plus a little bouquet of flowers to brighten my home. To be completely honest, grocery shopping is an adulting task that I’m still getting used to.<strong> </strong>The total amount is a lot, but I justify it because it’ll be cheaper than eating out. And by using my Klarna Card, I can easily track how much I’m spending in the app. And the beauty of this card — and how it differs from other cards — is that I can use it two ways: as a regular debit card wherever Visa or virtual payments are accepted (so, <em>pretty much </em>everywhere) and as a way to plan for a bigger purchase and pay later. </p>



<p>I first learned about Klarna in college. I would buy clothes, and with Klarna, pay the amount in installments. Making smaller payments was just easier (also, girl math), and I felt more in control of my spending. And so I love that I still have that ability to plan for purchases with the Klarna Card, except now, I can use it virtually anywhere and for virtually anything (instead of being limited to select merchants that have Klarna at checkout). <strong>$146</strong></p>



<p>7 p.m. — My mom talks non-stop about this pasta recipe she’s always making nowadays, so I take a shot at making it with my newly purchased ingredients. And she wasn’t exaggerating — it’s <em>good. </em></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $146</strong></p>



<h2>Day Seven</h2>



<p>10 a.m. — I show up to the nail salon because I made an actual appointment this time (#womeninstem). And my nails came out so cute. I simply tap to pay using my Klarna Card (#blessed). <strong>$112</strong></p>



<p>2 p.m. — As much as I want to order food because I don’t feel like cooking, I lace up my big-girl boots and make a lettuce wrap with the groceries I bought earlier. Who’s proud of me? (Me haha).</p>



<p>5 p.m. — Sundays are all about comfort. And it just so happens that <em>all </em>of my favorite shows air on Sundays. So you can find me on my couch for the rest of the night — it’s a ritual that reminds me of home, even if home is now thousands of miles away. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $112</strong></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>“I must confess: I don’t usually track my spending, so I honestly thought that I’d spend <em>way</em> more this week. But I feel good about where my money went. Most of what I spent was on little things that made me happy — like flowers or a matcha or a cute workout top — which feels like the best kind of spending. But I’m also very much aware that regularly dining out can add up, which was why I started to make a concerted effort to cook more at home this week. Keeping track of everything helped me see where my money was going, and using my Klarna Card gives me the flexibility to pay now or plan a purchase to pay later.”</p>

<h2>Day One: Sunday</h2>



<p>7 a.m. — Big fan of an early weekend morning. I head directly to the kitchen and power up my coffee machine. I spend an ungodly amount on the pods for this thing, which is a big upfront cost, but it actually saves me <em>so much money. </em></p>



<p>11 a.m. — One thing about me? I romanticize *everything*. My boyfriend is over for the weekend, and we enjoy the dropping temps and drink our fall-flavored coffee in the backyard. Our dog is very happy with this idea. </p>



<p>3 p.m. — We spend the rest of the day on the couch and enjoy the fact that we don’t need the air conditioner on. I do some online window shopping for some home items, but I don’t actually place any orders. </p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — I’m good about cooking during the week, but weekends are usually takeout dinners. My boyfriend and I are in the mood for different things, so he orders Chinese and I opt for my favorite lamb biryani from the Indian place down the street. <strong>$18.83 </strong></p>



<p>8 p.m. — A. &amp; our pup head home to their place and I tuck into a book for an hour or so and get to sleep early. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $18.83</strong></p>



<h3>Day Two: Monday</h3>



<p>6:30 a.m. — I work from home on Mondays, so my day starts similarly to yesterday. Work days feel so much less daunting when I have a couple hours to myself before I have to log on. I drink coffee, watch one of my vlogger girlies, and scroll a little. </p>



<p>10 a.m. — Therapy! And coffee #2.</p>



<p>3 p.m. — Work is passing by in a blur of meetings and deck slides that I’ll definitely (unwillingly) see in my dreams tonight. </p>



<p>4:30 p.m. — I take a stroll to my new favorite grocery store. I’m set on making the first pot roast of the season tonight despite the fact it should already be in the oven by now. I grab ingredients for the roast, a few essentials for the week, and a few fun items (apple crisp probiotic sodas and a cinnamon babka) that are not remotely essential. <strong>$64.32</strong></p>



<p>8 p.m. — I eat a later dinner than usual (worth it) and wind down with my evening ritual of cross stitching and a show before getting into bed with a book. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $64.32</strong></p>



<h3>Day Three: Tuesday</h3>



<p>8 a.m. — Today is an office day, so after a coffee and breakfast at home I begin the commute via train. My neighborhood looks so cute right now and I take pictures of all the fall decorations on the brownstones and send them to my best friend back home. <strong>$2.90</strong> </p>



<p>8:45 a.m. — Stop by a coffee shop despite telling myself I wouldn’t. I grab a large latte and a snack. <strong>$9.03</strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — I completely forgot to bring the leftovers I packed up for myself, so I have to get lunch out. I would’ve skipped the latte if I’d known. I grab a couple of onigiris because they’re filling and cheap ($8.64). I pass by the bookstore and I can’t help myself… I treat myself to a book I’ve had my eye on. Are you sensing a pattern here?<strong> $37.11 </strong></p>



<p>7 p.m. — I have dinner plans tonight with a friend in the West Village. Something about this time of year has me craving a cozy Italian spot, and we both order pasta and a couple martinis. I fight the devil on my shoulder telling me to take a cab and I hop on the train instead. <strong>$95.69</strong></p>



<p>9:30 p.m. — Straight to bed! </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $144.73</strong></p>



<h3>Day Four: Wednesday</h3>



<p>8:45 a.m. — Back to the office. I remember my leftovers this time but on the way to work ($2.90), I still spring for the coffee, because I really need the emotional security a latte brings me. <strong>$8.89</strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — On my lunch break I revisit what’s in my cart from my online window shopping sesh a few days ago. I’m looking to switch up the rug in my living room (also, can we talk about why rugs are SO expensive?!). I found a beautiful one I really love, but I’m struggling to pull the trigger on a bigger purchase, especially after yesterday’s spending. </p>



<p>Big purchases make me nervous. I didn’t grow up in a family that used credit cards much, and I’ve always been cautious with them. I have one with a low limit, and I’m not exactly great at keeping the balance down — so raising my limit or opening another card isn’t something I’m interested in doing. That’s why I love the <a href=""https://www.klarna.com/us/klarna-card/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Klarna Card</a> — the debit card that gives me two ways to pay: 1) in full like a regular debit card, or 2) I can plan a purchase and choose to pay later. Even better: There aren’t any annual fees and there wasn’t any impact to my credit in order for me to apply. </p>



<p>5:15 p.m. — Work goes by quickly today and I head home. I pay the train fare, and on the way home I stop in my local branch of the library to pick up a couple holds.<strong> $2.90</strong></p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — After dinner, I sit on the couch; I just can’t stop thinking about the rug. After thinking about it, I decide it’s the right time to get it. I use my Klarna Card to plan a purchase and pay later, so I don’t have to pay in full right at this moment. Making purchases this way feels more natural, comfortable, and responsible because I feel more in control of my spending. And because I can plan a purchase that’s as big as this one, it gives me time to figure out if I actually want it (the answer in this case: Yes. Yes, I want it). <strong>$387.33 ($96.84 today)</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $399.12 (but actually only $108.63 today, thanks to Klarna!)</strong></p>



<h3>Day Five: Thursday</h3>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937998.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>9 a.m. — A surprise to no one, a latte is secured on the way to the office ($2.90). It’s finally cool enough to wear the new fall clothes I got recently, and my outfit — a deep green short-sleeve sweater, dark wash barrel leg jeans, and leopard print flats — has me in an excellent mood, even when the train (inevitably) has delays. <strong>$8.89 </strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — I have a really successful client presentation and the good vibes of today continue. Perhaps even more exciting is that the office provides lunch today and I have delicious (free!) Cuban food. </p>



<p>4:45 p.m. — I head home. <strong>$2.90 </strong></p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — The pot roast is no more. I don’t have many groceries, and I don’t want to buy any before I’m gone for the weekend, so I dig in the cabinets and make boxed mac and cheese and a tuna melt. It slaps, honestly. I work on my cross stitching project and watch a vibey ‘90s movie before crawling into bed around 9. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $11.79</strong></p>



<h3>Day Six: Friday</h3>



<p>8:30 a.m. — I’ve made it to Friday, a WFH day. I’m out of cream for coffee, so I walk to the bodega to grab some. <strong>$5.97</strong></p>



<p>2 p.m. — After wrapping up work, I do my Friday tidy. I realize I’m almost out of surface cleaner and order another one (Fall Leaves scent, of course). I see there’s a matching hand soap and grab that, too. <strong>$11.21 </strong></p>



<p>4:30 p.m. — We’re spending this weekend at my boyfriend’s place. We live in the same borough, but it still feels like a long-distance relationship. The train commute is brutal (1.5 hours <em>and</em> two transfers), so I always spring for a cab. We all have vices and this is one of mine.<strong> $33.42</strong></p>



<p>6 p.m. — A. lives across the street from one of our favorite easy takeout places, so we walk over together to pick up our mobile orders. He pays. </p>



<p>7 p.m. — After we eat, we play a video game together (a new thing for us lately) and watch a few episodes of TV. I go to bed before him and read until I fall asleep. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $50.60</strong></p>



<h3>Day Seven: Saturday</h3>



<p>9:30 a.m. — We wake up later than I’m used to and lay in bed even longer. Once we’re up, we split up: I walk our dog while he picks up coffee across the street (my treat). <strong>$12.40</strong></p>



<p>12:45 p.m. — Our closest couple friends live close by, and we meet them in the park for an outside hang. We stop to grab a bottle of wine on the way. Afterwards, we take the bus home. <strong>$24.39</strong></p>



<p>3:30 p.m. — I’m sleepy after the park hang and the glasses of wine, so I take a cat nap on the couch with the dog (A. doesn’t nap). When I wake up, it’s time to think about what to eat, again. I think that’s basically what being an adult comes down to: figuring out what to eat, ad infinitum. We don’t want to spend money on takeout, so we jazz up some ramen we have in the cabinet.  </p>



<p>6 p.m. — I love that the sun is going down earlier and that the vibe is already right for movie watching at 6. This time of year, I crave old scary movies, and we turn on a classic. </p>



<p>9:15 p.m. — We hang out for a couple hours longer and I head off to bed with my book, getting a few chapters in before I drift off. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $36.79</strong></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>“This is a pretty typical fall week of spending, leaning into the coziness of the season. I did spend more than usual on the rug purchase, but I planned for it and used Klarna to make it feel more manageable. My spending style is about balance and enjoying life responsibly. I’ll spend on things that bring me joy and have long-term value, like the rug, but I’ll happily have boxed mac and cheese the next day. I don’t mind that I spend on little things like a coffee in the morning because it genuinely makes me feel better about whatever I have to tackle that day. I am certainly not the most frugal person I know, but I’m cautious and responsible where it counts. This week’s spending confirms that I spend money to build a life that feels warm and lived in, which is exactly how I want to use it.” </p>

I have a confession to make: I canceled my spa membership. I didn’t want to. I genuinely love my monthly <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/skincare-trends-2025"">skincare treatments</a> and catching up with my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/03/11304905/latinas-esthetician-beauty-careers"">esthetician</a> about skincare, career, family, and romance. But with rising costs from inflation and a fragile job market, I had to make some tough decisions and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/budgeting-tools-spending-diary"">cut back on spending</a> — and that meant professional grooming had to go (for now, at least). <br /><br />I’m not alone. A <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/diy-beauty-americans-skip-salons-tariff-worries-price-hikes-2025-5"">Business Insider</a> report from May 2025 found that 42% of regular salon patrons reduced their visits in the past six months, with 24% stopping services entirely. Most of them cite saving money as the reason for breaking up with their nail tech, hairstylist, esthetician, or massage therapist. Since Latines are among the most affected by job losses — with unemployment rates up 10% since April, according to <a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/job-losses-hit-blacks-asians-and-hispanics-11820140"">Investopedia</a> — many of us are also taking a break from our favorite salons and spas, or at least reconsidering them.<br /><br />But just because I’m no longer spending $100 to $150 a month on facials doesn’t mean I’m giving up on skincare altogether. According to Neutrogena’s 2025 Belleza Latina Study, nine out of 10 Latinas between the ages of 18 and 34 say clear, healthy skin is extremely important, and more than half call their skincare routine a source of confidence. I couldn’t agree more.<br /><br />With that in mind, we’ve put together an at-home facial guide that combines salon-style technology with Latina-owned skincare products — so you can treat yourself with ingredients and techniques rooted in culture at a fraction of the spa cost. And while some of these products are an investment, unlike a single in-salon treatment, they’ll last you for dozens of uses.<br /> <br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

The Qori Serum shields and balances the skin with bakuchiol and licorice root extract, reducing hyperpigmentation and boosting collagen, during the ovulatory phase.

Apply a pea-sized amount to the under-eye area using your ring finger or the accompanying applicator, gently tapping until the cream is fully absorbed.<br /><br /><strong>Skinwit</strong> Skinwit's Firming &amp; Illuminating Eye Cream, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fskinwit.com%2Fproducts%2Feye-cream-latin-skin%3Fselling_plan%3D6035734719"">Skinwit</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1338"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938683.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1322&amp;height=1338&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=661:669"" width=""1322"" /><figcaption><strong>Exfoliate Your Lips With Seis Cosmetics’ Sugar Lip Scrub</strong><br /><br />One of the most frustrating facial add-ons is a lip exfoliation.

Infused with shea butter, peppermint oil, rice extract, safflower oil, sunflower extract, and rosemary extract, this scrub smooths rough textures and leaves your lips feeling nourished and protected. Simply apply a small amount to slightly damp lips, gently massage with your finger to exfoliate, and rinse with warm water.<br /><br /><strong>Seís Cosmetics</strong> Seis Cosmetics’ Sugar Lip Scrub, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.seiscosmetics.com%2Fproducts%2Fsugar-lip-scrub"">Seís Cosmetics</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1338"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938686.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1342&amp;height=1338&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=671:669"" width=""1342"" /><figcaption><strong>Lock in Moisture With Vamigas’ Boquita de Rosa Lip Mask</strong><br /><br />Last but certainly not least, it's time to moisturize your freshly exfoliated lips with a nourishing lip mask.

Fall is finally here, and you know what that means: The holidays are just around the corner. And while it may feel early, that hasn’t deterred brands from releasing some of their big-ticket holiday items. Case in point: Beauty-stuffed <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/unique-advent-calendars"">advent calendars</a>.<br /><br />While these blockbuster sets usually come at a premium price point, that's for a few reasons: They tend to be limited in quantity, feature exquisite packaging, and contain myriad products, including full sizes or limited-edition shades. <br /><br />All that's to say that the beauty-filled advent calendars you'll find here are not only marvelous to <em>ooh</em> and <em>aah</em> at but also provide a surprisingly good value, given the ample contents inside. (Pro tip: Find a buddy to go halfsies with and divide the spoils.) And while advent calendars are inherently an exercise in patience, we won't tell if you open up all the teeny-tiny doors the day it arrives on your doorstep...<br /><br /><em>At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.

There’s so much to love about autumn: the crisp air brushing against our skin, the kaleidoscope of crunchy leaves under our boots, and the scent of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-fall-candles-2025-latine"">pumpkin and spiced candles</a> drifting through homes, cafés, and bookshops. It’s the season of cozy dinners, pumpkin patch adventures, spooky nights with friends and family — and, of course, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fall-2025-fashion-beauty-lookbook"">timeless fall outfits</a>.<br /><br />And nothing complements the warmth of turtlenecks, blazers, and cardigans quite like a leather handbag. This season, some of our favorite brands have released stunning collections of satchels, totes, mini bags, crossbodies, and weekenders in rich browns, deep reds, forest greens, and burnt oranges. <br /><br />Whether you love the polished feel of genuine leather built to last, prefer reimagined pieces crafted from recycled materials, or choose vegan alternatives to lighten your carbon footprint, we’ve curated our favorite fall handbags from Latine-owned and Latin American-operated brands that embody craftsmanship, culture, and style.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

The PETA Award-winning brand crafts handbags from premium vegan leather materials like polyurethane, which not only look and feel like genuine leather but are also cruelty-free, eco-conscious, and designed to minimize environmental impact.<br /><br />Right now, I’m loving the Rue Burgundy Recycled Vegan Top Handle Bag. This structured bag features a deep burgundy recycled vegan leather exterior, a sturdy top handle, and a detachable crossbody strap for versatility. Meanwhile, gold-tone hardware, a zip-top closure, and a roomy interior make it as functional as it is gorgeous.

Handcrafted in premium vegan and genuine leathers and sustainable materials, the self-taught designer resists the fast-fashion cycle, creating bold, statement handbags that are ethically made and built to last.<br /><br />Currently, I can’t get enough of the Woven Ashley Minimalist Baguette. Its rich brown woven leather, sculptural crescent silhouette, and structured top handle make it a perfect companion for fall.

From the beginning, Nicole’s goal was to create a brand that was 100% Mexican — and she has. From suppliers to leather craftsmen to metal workers, every one of her small-batch collections is made entirely in her home country. For her, this ensures that “every collection and every bag is truly única.”<br /><br />If you’re looking for a new staple for your closet, I’m currently obsessed (no, literally) with the Carolina Bag in Merlot. This bold, ‘90s-inspired shoulder bag combines style and functionality. Despite its compact size, it offers ample space for all your essentials. Crafted from high-quality full-grain cowhide leather and featuring 24k gold-dipped hardware, the Carolina Bag stands out while complementing any outfit.

This fall, the brand launched the Forma Satchel, a gorgeous and functional bag crafted in Turkey from Italian pebbled leather with a soft microsuede lining. Designed to carry your essentials with ease, its spacious interior fits laptops, water bottles, phones, and even a change of shoes, making it ideal for day-to-night wear or travel as your personal item.

Driven by a deep concern for the environmental impact of the fashion industry, her brand <a href=""https://matergea.com/"">Matergea</a> utilizes plant-based and bio-based materials such as cactus leather, fique fiber blended with coffee waste, and fabrics made from hemp, organic cotton, recycled cotton, and PET bottles. Meanwhile, its accessories feature handles crafted from tagua (vegetable ivory), bamboo, jute, and wicker.<br /><br />This autumn, I’ve got my eye on the Senda Purse Coffee Grains Waste Handle. This elegant piece is crafted from a unique blend of fique fiber and coffee grain waste, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional leather. The purse features a distinctive handle made from repurposed coffee grains, adding a touch of eco-conscious luxury. Its rich, earthy tones make it a perfect accessory for the fall season, complementing cozy sweaters and warm hues.

Drawing inspiration from their family’s passion for fashion, they established Esthera with a vision to create handbags that transcend the ordinary. Like the brand's name, derived from “estrela” — Portuguese for “star” — the designers want users to feel exceptional while wearing their pieces.<br /><br />Esthera’s debut collection, AM | PM, captures the essence of daily life and is made to transition from day to night seamlessly. Each bag is named after specific times of the day. My fave is the 4PM Mini Handbag in Caramel. This structured leather bag boasts an architectural design with a cubic silhouette and precise proportions. It features organic cutouts inspired by the hourglass, Esthera’s signature symbol. Crafted from premium leather, it’s finished with tubular handles that adapt comfortably to the wearer, allowing it to be carried by hand or worn over the shoulder. Meanwhile, the rich caramel hue adds a warm, autumnal touch. <br /><br /><strong>Esthera</strong> Esthera's 4PM Mini Handbag Caramel, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Festhera.com%2Fproducts%2F4pm-mini-handbag-caramel&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Ffall-leather-handbags-latine"">Esthera</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""3600"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938257.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=2400&amp;height=3600&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=2:3"" width=""2400"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://bysentient.com/"">SENTIENT</a> was founded in Mexico City by Jimena Suárez Ibarrola, a Mexican environmental lawyer turned ethical fashion entrepreneur, with a vision to reshape what it means to wear luxury. The name Sentient underscores a core belief that all beings — human or animal — can feel, and that beauty in fashion shouldn’t require cruelty of any kind. <br /><br />All its pieces are handmade by skilled artisans in Mexico, using “next-generation” vegan materials like cactus leather, bamboo leather, apple leather, and other plant-based alternatives. The materials are chosen to reduce water usage, pesticide impact, and carbon emissions compared to conventional leather. <br /><br />My favorite fall look from SENTIENT’s timeless collection is the Panthera Tote in Olive Green. This structured tote is crafted from cactus leather, giving it a firm silhouette that holds its shape beautifully. The olive green tone feels warm yet versatile, making it ideal for autumn’s camel trenches, cream knits, and rich terracotta tones. The bag features dual shoulder straps and clean lines, offering both elegance and everyday functionality while elevating your seasonal look.<br /><br /><strong>Sentient</strong> Sentient's Panthera Tote in Olive Green, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbysentient.com%2Fproducts%2Fpanthera-tote-olive-green-desserto"">Sentient</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""3722"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938140.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=2515&amp;height=3722&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=2515:3722"" width=""2515"" /><figcaption>Founded by queer Mexican designer Alejandro Miramontes, <a href=""https://sangredemar.com/"">Sangre de Mar</a> is a handbag and travel accessories brand that embodies the vibrant spirit of Mexico’s Pacific coastlines. Growing up in Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta, Miramontes joined his mother as a runner, helper, and salesperson for her leather goods business, selling leather jackets, belts, bags, and more. “Those experiences not only shaped my creative spirit, they gave me an unshakable respect for creativity, resilience, and the power of building something from nothing.” <br /><br />After working in the corporate fashion industry in Mexico, he moved to Vancouver, Canada, driven to design leather pieces inspired by both his mom’s resilience and Mexico’s coastal beauty.

<p>Melissa Butler, founder of <a href=""https://www.target.com/b/the-lip-bar/-/N-hw51c"">The Lip Bar</a>, knows what it’s like to experience failure — and on a <em>very</em> public level, too. When her inclusive beauty brand was three years old, she went on a national reality TV show to pitch The Lip Bar to a panel of investors…only to be told that her business would never grow. “They were so mean to us, they were so cruel. They said, ‘One of the big guys would crush you like the colorful cockroaches you are,’” she says in the latest episode of <em>Go Off, Sis</em>, recounting that devastating moment. “A lot of people have praised me for continuing: What gave you the courage to keep going forward? And I tell them: ‘I didn’t start my business for them, so I wasn’t going to end it for them.’”</p>



<p>Now, a decade later, The Lip Bar, is hugely successful, with its line of shades that complement *and* celebrate dark-skinned women available on the shelves at <a href=""http://target.com"">Target </a>nationwide. But Butler credits her Historically Black College and University (HBCU) education for preparing her for the realities of entrepreneurship, for helping her develop the fortitude to keep going and to strive for excellence, and for equipping her with the tools to ultimately succeed.</p>



<p>As a graduate of Florida A&amp;M University, Butler says that the competitive spirit at her school inspired her to push herself. “HBCUs remind you that there are no handouts, that you will have to work twice as hard,” she says. “Everyone knows that HBCUs are fun, for sure, but HBCUs have a unique ability to prepare students for the real world, and that’s the beauty of an HBCU — there’s that perfect balance.”  </p>



<p>And that’s precisely the subject discussed at length in the most recent episode of <em>Go Off, Sis</em>, done in partnership with Target. Butler is joined by Kathleen Newman-Bremang, the senior content director of entertainment at Refinery29 (who went to a Predominantly White Institution); Sandy Pierre, brand partnerships lead at Unbothered (who attended a PWI that was really an unofficial HBCU), and Claire Ateku, social producer at Unbothered (who’s a proud HBCU alumna). </p>



<p>Listen to the podcast in its entirety to learn more about Butler’s story (and how she learned more from her time as a student at her alma mater than on Wall Street), the unique cultural experience that is Homecoming at an HBCU, and so much more. </p>

<p>I count down to a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/06/11741501/bridgerton-michaela-stirling-francesca-queer-backlash"">new season of <em>Bridgerton</em></a> like football fans count down to the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/02/11853433/super-bowl-lix-parties-recap-new-orleans-2025"">Super Bowl</a>. They are 108 and 118 days away, respectively. The official release date for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/02/11860364/bridgerton-season-4-netflix-black-characters""><em>Bridgerton</em> Season 4</a> was just announced so now we know that on January 29, 2026 — with part two dropping in February —  we’ll get to see the romance play out between <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi9enqPOmUY"">Benedict (Luke Thomspon)</a> and his new love interest <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/yerin-ha-sophie-bridgerton-season-4"">Sophie Baek (Yerin Ha)</a>. We’ve already watched <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2020/12/10243310/bridgerton-netflix-sex-scenes-daphne-actress-interview"">Benedict’s older sister Daphne</a> burn for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2020/12/10244470/bridgerton-review-blackness-representation"">Simon the Duke of Hastings</a>, his big brother <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/04/10926918/bridgerton-season-2-review-sex-chemistry"">Anthony find love</a> with the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGCj2XlHVGI"">bane of his existence</a> and object of all his desires Kate Sharma, and his little bro <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l96vIHgSgwU"">Colin take a memorable carriage ride</a> and trip down the aisle with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/bridgerton-season-3-penelope-weight-loss-showrunner-interview"">Penelope aka Lady Whistledown</a>. Throughout those seasons, Benedict was the aloof middle brother, too busy drinking too much and partaking in gender-indiscriminate dalliances to want to settle down. That’s all going to change in January, starting with a masquerade ball and a chance meeting. </p>



<p>Fans of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/bridgerton-season-3-penelope-weight-loss-showrunner-interview""><em>Bridgerton</em> books</a> have been waiting patiently for Benedict and Sophie’s story since theirs is considered one of the strongest of Julia Quinn’s storylines. And even if you aren’t a <em>Bridgerton</em> book truther, Benedict has consistently been one of the most intriguing characters on the show. He hasn’t found much romantic luck so far, but he also hasn’t wanted to. He’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2024/05/11718497/bridgerton-queer-storylines-future-showrunner-interview"">a queer king</a> who’s been prioritizing freedom over commitment. What will make Sophie the person that changes his mind? And how will <em>Bridgerton </em>incorporate Sophie and her family — the first major <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2024/11/11813897/katie-leung-harry-potter-bridgerton-interview"">East Asian characters</a> — into its cinematic universe? </p>



<p>Below, here’s everything you need to know about <em>Bridgerton</em> Season 4, including the plot, release date, teaser trailer, and what the cast and crew have said about the upcoming season. </p>



<h2><strong>How did <em>Bridgerton</em></strong><strong> Season 3 end? </strong></h2>



<p>At the end of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2022/05/10982332/bridgerton-season-3""><em>Bridgerton</em> Season 3</a>, Colin (Luke Newton) and Penelope (Nicola Coughlan) have worked through the issue of Penelope being the town gossip who repeatedly sullied the good Bridgerton name with her pen — as a fellow petty bitch, I am a Penelope apologist — and Colin refusing to see his best friend as the baddie she is, and are finally happily married with a baby boy. After ditching Lord Debling and getting well acquainted with the woman in the mirror, Penelope reveals herself as Lady Whistledown and realizes the value in the writing empire she has built. In Julia Quinn’s <em>Romancing Mister Bridgerton</em>, this reveal also marks the end of Lady Whistledown’s column. While the future of Whistledown is unclear in the show, the Queen and Penelope seem to come to an understanding.“If [the Queen] affords me the chance to continue, I aim to wield my quill more responsibly,” Penelope says in the final episode of Season 3. “What is life without a little gossip?” the Queen responds and it’s safe to assume that Penelope Bridgerton will be allowed to keep writing. </p>

<p>As for the other budding romances, at the end of Season 3 <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/06/11738825/bridgerton-season-3-lady-danbury-storyline"">Lady Danbury</a> gives her blessing for Lady Violet Bridgerton and her brother Lord Marcus Anderson to stop staring at each other longingly and actually start dating –  her reasoning being that she owes Violet for that time she had sex with her dad (a plot point from prequel series<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/queen-charlotte-a-bridgerton-story-review-race""> <em>Queen Charlotte</em></a> that I’m still trying to forget). Francesca and her new husband Sir John Kilmartin are headed to his estate in Scotland with Eloise and his cousin, Michaela Stirling (a character gender swapped from the books). My faves Anthony and Kate are headed to India to have their baby because <s>Jonathan Bailey and Simon Ashley are booked and busy</s> Anthony sweetly says he wants his children to know that part of their heritage. The Mondrichs, the only Black couple in the BCU, have mostly adjusted to their newfound wealth and status and — thank god — are as happily married as ever.</p>

<p>Season 3 ends with Benedict breaking up with Lady Tilley Arnold after a threesome with her friend Paul Suarez. Lady Tilley catches feelings for Benedict (if there’s one thing we know about the Bridgertons, they got that good D) but he’s just finally figuring out his sexuality and exploring himself so he opts to stay single and enjoy his freedom. </p>



<h2><strong>What is the plot of <em>Bridgerton</em> Season 4?</strong></h2>



<p>Here’s what we know from the season’s official logline: “The fourth season of <em>Bridgerton</em> turns its focus to bohemian second son Benedict (Luke Thompson). Despite his elder and younger brothers both being happily married, Benedict is loath to settle down — until he meets a captivating Lady in Silver at his mother’s masquerade ball.” In a teaser clip released from the season, we learn that the mysterious Lady in Silver is<a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/yerin-ha-sophie-bridgerton-season-4""> Sophie Baek</a> (<a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/yerin-ha-sophie-bridgerton-season-4"">Yerin Ha</a>) and when they meet at Lady Bridgerton’s famed masquerade ball, Benedict is immediately down bad. In this Cinderella story, Benedict (with the reluctant help of his sister Eloise), sets out to find his masked lady. The twist: Sophie is actually a maid working for the lady of the house,<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/11/11807404/katie-leung-harry-potter-bridgerton-interview""> Araminta Gun (Katie Leung). </a></p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938185.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>Bridgerton. (L to R) Isabella Wei as Posy Li, Katie Leung as Lady Araminta Gao, Michelle Mao as Rosamund Li in episode 401 of Bridgerton. Cr. Liam Daniel/Netflix © 2025</figcaption></figure>



<p>Here’s what else we know about the Season 4 plot, <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/bridgerton-season-4-cast-release-date-news"">thanks to Netflix</a>. Sophie Baek is “a resourceful maid for a demanding employer, disguises herself to attend Violet Bridgerton’s masquerade ball, where her life changes drastically after meeting Benedict Bridgerton.” As for Benedict: “While managing Bridgerton House’s affairs during Anthony’s honeymoon, Benedict, eager for new adventures, becomes the focus of Bridgerton’s fourth season, remaining reluctant to settle down unlike his married brothers, until he meets a captivating Lady in Silver at his mother’s masquerade ball.” </p>



<h2><strong>Which Bridgerton sibling is leading Season 4?</strong></h2>



<p>The <em>Bridgerton</em> series diverged from the order of the books last season when they opted to focus on Colin and Penelope instead of Benedict. Now, it’s Benedict’s time. It’s exciting not just because Thompson has proven he is a wonderful actor and I’m betting the best leading man we’ve had since Anthony (Coughlan carried Newton last season) but also because it’s the first time we’re getting a queer lead character in a <em>Bridgerton</em> season.</p>



<p>“We had talked a lot in Season 1 and 2 about whether or not Benedict might be queer. But we felt like we didn’t want to just tell that story as a side story,” Showrunner <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/bridgerton-season-3-ending"">Jess Brownell says to Netflix’s Tudum</a>. “We wanted to give it a little bit more space, and we wanted to get to know the character and develop him first.” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>A name is the first bit of identity that you share with the world, and that’s why changing a name can be so powerful… To make Sophie’s name fit someone who looks like me is really empowering.</p><cite>yerin ha to tudum on changing sophie’s last name </cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Benedict has been developed and I think he is the most fully formed and fleshed out character we’ve had as a lead so far. As the seasons progress, that’s natural, but it’s also clearly an intentional choice from the creative team. While we don’t know yet who will be the lead in Season 5 (it’s a toss up between Eloise and Francesca), we do know that every single Bridgerton sibling will get their moment to shine. </p>



<p>“Everybody’s going to have a main arc every season,” executive producer Shonda Rhimes <a href=""https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a41734448/inside-bridgerton-book-shonda-rhimes-betsy-beers-interview/"">tells Town &amp; Country</a>. “There’s going to be one for each one of the Bridgertons. We laid out the story in a way that felt right and necessary for us. And, eventually, every last one of those Bridgertons is going to have a love story.”</p>



<h2><strong>What has the cast said about <em>Bridgerton</em></strong><strong> Season 4? </strong></h2>



<p>One of the most exciting parts of this season will be the introduction of Baek and her family, the first East Asian family in <em>Bridgerton</em> history. And because of Yerin Ha’s casting, they changed the character’s last name from the books. “A name is the first bit of identity that you share with the world, and that’s why changing a name can be so powerful,” <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/yerin-ha-sophie-bridgerton-season-4"">Ha tells Netflix’s Tudum</a>. “To make Sophie’s name fit someone who looks like me is really empowering. All credit to Jess Brownell, our showrunner… It’s a really nice way for me to feel like the role is fit for me, rather than me having to fit a certain mold. It’s amazing what it can do just in a psychological sense. So it means a lot that Jess did that for me.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938186.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>Bridgerton. Yerin Ha as Sophie Beckett in episode 401 of Bridgerton. Cr. Liam Daniel/Netflix © 2025</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ha is a Korean-Australian actor who starred in <em>Halo</em> for two seasons and will be seen in the upcoming prequel series <em>Dune: Prophecy. </em>Playing Ha’s employer Lady Araminta Gun and the “evil stepmother” equivalent in the Cinderella archetype is Katie Leung, but Leung swears her character is just misunderstood. “I would never call her evil because I adore her — I think she’s absolutely fabulous. She’s just heavily misunderstood,” <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/11/11807404/katie-leung-harry-potter-bridgerton-interview"">Leung says to Refinery29</a>. “But if there’s anything that I can say, I mean, the costumes. They’re always brilliant on that show, but hers are something else.” </p>



<p>Along with the costumes, we can’t wait to see the dynamic between Lady Araminta Gun and Sophie play out. What we know so far is that Sophie is going to have some challenges, and her working for Lady Gun will be one of them. “What drew me to Sophie was that she immediately has obstacles — something that she constantly has to overcome,” <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/yerin-ha-sophie-bridgerton-season-4"">Ha tells Tudum</a>. “Whether it’s this battle around social status or trying to hide her feelings from Benedict.”</p>



<p>Speaking of Benedict, here’s what <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi9enqPOmUY"">Thompson says about the new season</a> to Shondaland: “The main thing we can expect is that it’s a really nice mix of fairytale and reality. It’s a fairytale love story but it’s also got the Bridgerton element of trying to tether it to some sort of reality as well. We’ll see how that pans out.” Ha adds: “You can expect this an emotional tug of war, this push-and-pull between what their heart desires and what society desires for them.” </p>



<p>And yes, you can expect all your favorite Bridgertons to be back. Colin and Penelope will be deep in their happily ever after, according to what Luke Newton <a href=""https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a60803762/bridgerton-season-4-penelope-colin-romance-nicola-coughlan-luke-newton-interview/"">says to Town &amp; Country</a>: “I’m excited for the happily ever after and to see what that brings… I have so much trust in Jess [Brownell, the showrunner] that it will always be interesting and always be exciting. That’s also the joy of being in the Bridgeton family: There’s always going to be drama. There’s always going to be something I get to help out with or causing mischief or whatever it is.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938188.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>Bridgerton.

<p>And on Good Morning America in August 2024, Jonathan Bailey confirmed he’ll be back as Anthony for Season 4. “Being the elder brother, I’m going to be there to support the youngsters.” And Anthony’s better half, Kate, will also be back. Simone Ashley told <a href=""https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/simone-ashley-interview-2024-glamour-women-of-the-year-awards"">Glamour</a> in October 2024 that she will be making an appearance in Season 4: “I know that I am returning, but that’s all I can say. I absolutely adore the show, and the more I can be a part of it, the better. They’ve been really kind to work around my schedule.”</p>



<h2><strong>When will <em>Bridgerton</em> Season 4 be released? </strong></h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.eonline.com/news/1423699/bridgerton-season-4-release-date-teaser-trailer""><em>Bridgerton</em> Season 4</a> will be arriving in two parts in 2026. The first half premieres on January 29 and the second half arrives on February 26. </p>
