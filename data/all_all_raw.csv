His building plot in the suburban area of Beijing had been left unused for many years. In 2022, he conceived the idea of utilizing it, though the specific manner of how to do so remained uncertain. I remember during our first discussion, he mentioned three possibilities: (1) using it as a second residence for himself, with the possibility of his parents occasionally staying there; (2) converting it into his company's office space after three years; or (3) renting it out if no concrete plans were finalized. Therefore, our design process began by systematically analyzing the corresponding relationships between these three different functional requirements and the spatial layout.</p>",

<h4><strong>As AI mirrors how we design and learn, our role evolves from creating interfaces to defining the signals that shape intelligent experiences.</strong></h4><blockquote>A quick note before we dive in. This essay continues the thinking I introduced in <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/from-design-to-direction-bridging-product-design-and-ai-thinking-1d372707472d""><em>From design to direction: bridging product design and AI thinking</em></a>. While it is not required reading, it might give helpful context as I build on some of the ideas from that earlier exploration. Do not worry, I will be here when you return.</blockquote><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a signal plus a robot element representing AI will lead towards more targeted generative experiences."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*RMLNlIo1dX8HPoHTnndtPQ.png"" /><figcaption>Illustration for how signals will be key in a more generative experiential future.</figcaption></figure><p>In my first thought piece, I discussed how AI concepts overlap with the work of product designers as we optimize across three key levels: the interfaces we aim to make frictionless, the journeys that help users find value, and the connection to the business outcomes we hope to achieve.</p><p>That work is becoming even more important today. As AI-driven and generative tools move into our day-to-day workflows, the experiences we design no longer stop at the interface. Interfaces can now generate, adapt, and learn from what users do next. The quality of those learning loops depends on the quality of the signals we build into them.</p><p>As we move from static interfaces to generative ones, understanding the signals produced by our experiences and how those signals tie back to a user’s intent becomes foundational. These signals help generative systems reduce model loss, meet expectations, and continue doing what we care about most: helping people make progress in ways they find meaningful.</p><p>In this essay, I will share an approach for connecting instrumentation efforts to high-level business goals and how that prepares us to map signals to intent in ways that shape iterative optimization loops for generative experiences.</p><h3>Understanding what to measure: defining meaning before data</h3><p>There is a lot of writing out there about instrumentation and telemetry, so I will only touch on the basics here. Many of us have heard terms like attrition, cart abandonment, or error rate. We usually hear them through conversations with product managers who reference these numbers as indicators of progress or where improvements are sought after. But I would ask you if you truly know terms like these mean when thinking about the bigger picture?</p><p>Let’s start simple and work out from there by settling on two things. First, let’s define t<a href=""https://www.intercom.com/blog/finding-the-metrics-that-matter-for-your-product/"">elemetry as the raw data we collect.</a> Instrumentation, on the other hand, is the act of deciding which of those data points matter.</p><figure><img alt=""Image illustrating websites with numerous signals causing confusion for AI."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*_UH2OjwJE7okOjG565EFBQ.png"" /><figcaption>Imagine signals as a bunch of news stations all going at once at the same time with the same volume. Just like how we would be unable to focus intelligently, the same can be said for AI.</figcaption></figure><p>We could instrument every single action in a product, but without knowing what is <em>truly</em> meaningful, all we have is noise. The same challenge applies to AI systems, believe it or not. A model trained on large amounts of similar data might recognize correlations, but without context or intent, it cannot know where to focus.</p><p>Deciding what matters does two things. It guides our analysis toward insight instead of noise, and it makes our systems more efficient. Over-instrumentation, taught to me by my data and analytics partners at a prior role, increases storage and processing costs and makes it harder for both humans and machines to understand what users are trying to do.</p><p>By deciding what to focus on before we collect data, we can curate meaningful signals. These signals connect behavior to intent and intent to organizational outcomes. That is the foundation of this framework: shaping experience data so it becomes direction for both product teams and intelligent systems. Bare with me and let’s talk business.</p><h3>Defining what matters</h3><figure><img alt=""Illustration depicting certain telemetry signals being selected for instrumentation efforts to educate our teams and AI tools."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*xlEncsYKVieJ1yf2Zia9_A.png"" /><figcaption>When we contextualize signals around what is meaningful, both our teams and AI can start to make sense of all the noise.</figcaption></figure><p>When we design digital experiences, countless events occur on the front end and back end. Some happen autonomously, some because of user actions. Each is a potential signal, but we need a structured way to interpret them. One useful lens is <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/personas-jobs-be-done/""><em>Jobs to Be Done</em></a> (JTBD).</p><figure><img alt=""Framework illustration listing, from top down, company goal, organizational goal(s), Measurement objectives/OKRs, KPIs, and Signals to show how these support one another."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*aDjnFLyYqaFkBQOawVNIIw.png"" /><figcaption>Each row, from the bottom, should ladder up and support the goals above them to create a stable structure connecting in product signals up to company goals.</figcaption></figure><p>To start, most companies, no matter their size, are fundamentally trying to create value and generate revenue. If we acknowledge that end goal, we can place it at the top of our framework. You may already be familiar with terms like <a href=""https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/pricing-strategies-and-sales-proposals/get-to-know-your-revenue-model""><em>Average Contract Value</em> (ACV) or <em>Average Order Value</em> (AOV)</a>. These are common ways organizations measure growth and understand how customers perceive the value they offer.</p><figure><img alt=""Image illustrating overall framework with AOV filled in at top for company goal conveying all subsequent elements support this high-level goal."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*L59_F2lwhp5oHu-wNIHPhQ.png"" /><figcaption>We always need to identify the reason we do what we do, and typically it involves money.</figcaption></figure><p>Within companies, different groups support the business in different ways. For example, a large online store might have a website team focused on the digital shopping experience and a customer support team helping customers resolve issues. If increasing AOV is a company priority, the website team may set a goal like:</p><blockquote><strong>Improve cross-sell or upsell effectiveness.</strong></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Illustration of framework with example organizational goal."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*Adbi0dEL7_2z-nH_oUf97Q.png"" /><figcaption>Various internal organizations will have their own goals typically created at executive levels.</figcaption></figure><p>From there, we next have the <em>Measurement Objective</em>. This is where we identify the type of behavior we want to influence to support the organizational goal. It is common for multiple measurement objectives to exist for the same goal, especially in larger companies.</p><p>In our online store example, one measurement objective might be encouraging users to add additional items before checking out. To make this meaningful, we can express it as an OKR. Atlassian has a helpful overview of<a href=""https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/okr""> how OKRs function</a> in cross-functional teams if the concept is new.</p><p>A possible OKR might be:</p><blockquote><strong>Increase average items per cart from 1.6 to 1.9.</strong></blockquote><p>This is still fairly high-level, usually tied to a quarter or fiscal year, but it moves us closer to meaningful, measurable work.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of framework with example measurement objective added."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*fW7-KK5eZrBE0Y1H_WikAQ.png"" /><figcaption>Remember OKRs are not KPIs and sit at a higher level.</figcaption></figure><p>Below this sits the <em>Key Performance Indicator </em>(KPI) layer. KPIs are the specific metrics we can directly influence through design and iteration. They give us the levers we can adjust and monitor as we learn. If KPIs feel a little abstract, Asana has a <a href=""https://asana.com/resources/key-performance-indicator-kpi"">great explanation</a> of how teams use them as measurable signals of progress.</p><p>A related KPI might be:</p><blockquote><strong>Increase add-to-cart rate for recommended items by fifteen percent this quarter.</strong></blockquote><p>This gives teams something concrete to experiment with, design for, and measure.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of framework with example KPI filled in."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*muzWF_MjqtyjYKFjUOB4-w.png"" /><figcaption>KPIs can rotate quarterly (common) and still leave room for teams to ideate on how to meet that particular goal.</figcaption></figure><p>With all of this in place, we now have a path from:</p><blockquote><strong>AOV → organizational goal → measurement objective → OKR → KPI</strong></blockquote><p>Now we can move closer to the design layer: understanding user intent and determining the right signals to collect.</p><h3>Connecting signals to intent</h3><figure><img alt=""Illustration with signal section of framework filled in, directing audience to review table of examples below."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*ER93jIm8Wc3a22hlA9sWfg.png"" /><figcaption>As alluded to, there is no one end-all signal. It will take a critical look and collaboration across product and data and analytics teams to capture the right signals for your org.</figcaption></figure><p>Let’s assume our KPI example from before aligns with a JTBD that looks like this:</p><blockquote><strong>When I am shopping for something I need, I want to easily discover related or complementary items so my order feels complete.</strong></blockquote><p>To understand whether users are making progress toward that job, we need to collect telemetry data from key activities. Not every event will matter, but the right ones reveal intent.</p><figure><img alt=""Table of sample signal categories which related to overarching shopper Job detailing how they potential signal various intents AI could pick up on."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*v1HviC_KmaYp-a9xFEhkYQ.png"" /><figcaption>Examples of signals related to the core Job and their connection to identifying a shopper’s intent.</figcaption></figure><p>Signals help us see not only what users are doing but whether they are moving in the direction that represents meaningful progress. Positive signals show alignment. Negative signals reveal friction or mismatched intent.</p><p>This creates a full path from business outcomes down to the behaviors that reflect real value.</p><h3>How the framework extends into generative AI</h3><p>Everything up to this point applies to traditional products where designers create fixed interfaces. Generative experiences change the structure of the work. Instead of designing every step, we are designing the conditions a system uses to decide what to show, what to emphasize, and how to adapt.</p><p>Generative systems do not follow pre-built screens. They follow patterns, predictions, and signals.</p><p>In generative experiences, intent can surface explicitly through a question, a prompt, or a choice, or implicitly through behavior. <a href=""https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/"">Google’s PAIR guidebook</a> talks about this distinction between explicit intent and intent inferred from behavior, which forms the basis for how AI predicts what comes next.</p><p>Once the system infers intent, it predicts what the user needs next. That prediction determines what gets generated, whether that is a layout, a set of recommendations, content variations, or the next step in a flow. Even so, we still need a way to understand whether the prediction was correct. <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/guidelines-for-human-ai-interaction/"">Microsoft’s Human-AI Interaction Guidelines </a>reinforce this by encouraging systems to make their reasoning visible and understandable, so people can verify whether predictions make sense.</p><p>This is where the framework becomes essential. Organizational goals, OKRs, KPIs, and JTBDs give us a standard for what “good” looks like. They describe the journey and the progress that represent value for users. The signals we instrument become evidence of whether the generated experience actually supported that progress.</p><p>Even when a generative system produces something entirely new, we can still evaluate it. We are not comparing the UI to a previous layout. We are comparing behavior to expected signals. If users are moving forward, the inference was correct. If users hesitate, ignore content, or abandon, the system has made the wrong assumption. <a href=""https://openai.com/index/learning-to-summarize-with-human-feedback/"">OpenAI describes a similar idea</a> in their work on learning from human feedback, where systems compare predicted outcomes to desired ones.</p><p>This gives designers two places to focus optimization efforts. We can refine the experience that was generated, or we can refine how the system infers intent. Sometimes this means improving interface patterns. Sometimes it means strengthening the signals we collect. Sometimes it means giving users clearer ways to express what they want.</p><p>Either way, the work becomes the same. We check the signals produced by a generative interface against the expected signals tied to a JTBD, and we use that comparison to guide how the system adapts.</p><p>This is how designers contribute to AI-driven experiences. We are not only designing what users see. We are designing the understanding the system relies on to generate it.</p><h3>Where we go from here</h3><p>All of this sets up the next step. Generative systems cannot rely on signals alone. They also need to understand our components, patterns, and design systems in deeper, more semantic ways. <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/the-future-of-design-systems-is-semantic/"">Figma has written about this shift</a> in their guidance on semantic design systems, emphasizing that AI needs component meaning, not just component visuals, to generate interfaces responsibly.</p><p>In the next article, I will explore how semantic design systems help shape what generative systems create, and how that connects to the broader ideas of encoding, pattern representation, and meaning within AI models.</p><h3>Further reading</h3><p>If you would like to explore some of the ideas mentioned in this article, here are a few helpful starting points:</p><p><strong>Instrumentation and product measurement</strong><br /> • What is a KPI? — Asana<br /> <a href=""https://asana.com/resources/key-performance-indicator-kpi"">https://asana.com/resources/key-performance-indicator-kpi</a><br /> • How OKRs work — Atlassian<br /> <a href=""https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/okr"">https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/okr</a></p><p><strong>AI, intent, and prediction quality</strong><br /> • People + AI Guidebook — Google PAIR<br /> <a href=""https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/"">https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/</a><br /> • Learning from human feedback — OpenAI<br /> <a href=""https://openai.com/index/learning-to-summarize-with-human-feedback/"">https://openai.com/index/learning-to-summarize-with-human-feedback/</a><br /> • Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction — Microsoft Research<br /> <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/guidelines-for-human-ai-interaction/"">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/guidelines-for-human-ai-interaction/</a></p><p><strong>Design systems and meaning</strong><br /> • The future of design systems is semantic — Figma<br /> <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/the-future-of-design-systems-is-semantic/"">https://www.figma.com/blog/the-future-of-design-systems-is-semantic/</a></p><p>These pieces reflect similar themes around intent, signals, and how intelligent systems learn.

<h4><em>A shift towards token-first and AI-assisted systems</em></h4><p>Figma releases updates at a pace that feels pretty overwhelming. A new feature drops, you learn about the feature, then integrate it into your workflow. But soon after, more features are released and your workflow feels outdated again…like it’s an endless enhancement cycle.</p><p>For many designers, especially ones who manage large Design Systems, it’s hard to find time (and energy) to understand which features actually matter and how each Figma update affects your day-to-day work.</p><figure><img alt=""Figma features shown with component slots, Figma MCP, and extended collections"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HRFlQZdzrw0vNPHuxFgVIQ.png"" /></figure><p>But <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/schema-2025-design-systems-recap/"">Figma’s last few rounds of updates</a> focus on a token-first, structured, and AI-assisted workflow. Instead of circling around convenience features or quality of life updates, Figma is reshaping how Design System teams think about variables, code alignment, and how AI can expedite the process.</p><p>So which features should you focus on and what does each update actually mean for Design Systems? Let’s break down 3 critical updates recently rolled out with variables, component slots, and Figma MCP.</p><h3>Variables</h3><p>Variables have been at the forefront in supporting token-first systems. Figma recognized the common use case of multi-brand Design Systems, and its latest updates makes variables even more scalable. Let’s look at the new extended collections, new mode limits, and exporting variables.</p><h4>Extended collections</h4><p>There have been issues with multi-brand systems not meeting their adopter needs due to the limitations of Figma variables. Product teams would create hacks by copying variable collections into their own files, recreating themes, or even rebuilding token structures from scratch… meaning system updates and governance became broken across adopters.</p><p><strong>But with extended collections, Design System teams can support multiple brands/ products that require their own custom theme, while keeping variables in sync with the core system.</strong></p><p><strong>How extended collections work:</strong></p><ul><li>A Design System team publishes a core (parent) variable collection</li><li>Designers across the company can extend the core collection with their own brand-specific themes (overriding only the values they need)</li><li>The extended collections stay linked to the parent collection (and will inherit updates like new variables or token updates)</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Example of the extended collection’s modal for Figma variables"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DYlDw55gSnH-5KKWtZ_ymg.png"" /><figcaption>Extended collections allow multi-level branching</figcaption></figure><p><strong>But there are still limits of extended collections:</strong></p><ul><li>You cannot edit the variable’s alias name, scope, or mode in extended collections</li><li>Extended collections still require strong naming conventions and structure</li><li>Product designers may struggle to understand which token is pulling from where unless documentation is clear</li><li>They require more governance and a review process must be established for Design System members to ensure correct usage</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: Extended collections are only available for full seat users on Enterprise plans. I know many Organization plans also need this feature, so it’s disappointing it’s only available to premium accounts (please don’t shoot the messenger).</em></blockquote><h4>Increase in mode limits per plan</h4><p>Many Figma users have been personally victimized by how many modes were given to Professional and Organization plans. For instance, if a Design System supports 5 breakpoints (between X-Small and X-Large), they would not have been able to use variables to represent proper responsiveness. So the increase in how many modes you can use within each variable collection is better suited for team needs.</p><ul><li><strong>Professional:</strong> 10 modes per collection (up from 4)</li><li><strong>Organization:</strong> 20 modes per collection (up from 4)</li><li><strong>Enterprise:</strong> Unlimited modes with extended collections (up from 40)</li><li><strong>Starter:</strong> Not eligible (variables aren’t included in this plan)</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Figma variables showing many modes for a collection named “Breakpoints”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6n7IZQAtbtFR3ENo9SLh9g.png"" /><figcaption>Figma increased the amount of modes given to each plan type</figcaption></figure><p><strong>By increasing the capacity for modes, Figma is encouraging teams to move more variation into variables rather than building larger, heavier component libraries</strong>. Instead of teams finding “hacks” around the mode limitations, Design Systems can now have fewer overrides and duplicated components.</p><h4>Import and export as JSON</h4><p>Figma must have noticed many plugins were created to allow designers to import and export variables, like the <a href=""https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1256972111705530093/export-import-variables"">Export/Import Variables plugin</a>, because now they’ve introduced a built-in feature to serve this purpose.</p><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: Some accounts that should have this feature may still not have access (I still do not as of December 2025.)</em></blockquote><p><strong>Though it seems like a less significant update, it has huge implications for the maturity and governance of Design Systems</strong>. This helps teams adopt a “source of truth” mentality due to tokens from the design tools syncing with version-controlled repositories.</p><figure><img alt=""Demo of the import and export variables feature in Figma"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*X2y0XiNElF6zMr5bxZEziw.png"" /><figcaption><em>Image of import/ export variables feature from </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFjIaN_wlWg&amp;t=1313s""><em>Figma Schema</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Not only that, importing and exporting directly from Figma supports easier migration with fewer mistakes, automated updates of tokens, and a possible future of continuous integration between design and code.</p><h3>Component slots</h3><p>Figma components are powerful, but can also be rigid. If a designer needs to customize a component instance, they often have to find workarounds like detaching the component… a big “no-no” to Design System teams.</p><p><strong>But slots offer greater component flexibility without detaching. Basically, slots are placeholder containers inside components that let designers edit and customize content within an instance.</strong> And instead of relying on the Design System team to create product-specific components and increase library complexity, designers can insert the layer themselves.</p><p>Slots also allow Design Systems to specify which components are allowed inside a slot. So while designers have flexibility, they’re still working within system-approved patterns.</p><figure><img alt=""Demo of the component slots feature in Figma"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4wMiSfcsEahJHZmROX2NTQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Image of component slots’ demo from </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFjIaN_wlWg&amp;t=1313s""><em>Figma Schema</em></a></figcaption></figure><h4>Benefits and limits of slots</h4><p><strong>Some more “pros” of slots used in Design Systems are:</strong></p><ul><li>Slots mirror how components work in frontend frameworks so they align closer with code implementation</li><li>Components are simplified and clean by avoiding common flexibility workarounds</li><li>Complex components like cards and modals become easier to adapt across product teams due to slots’ scalability</li><li>System compliance improves due to slots’ design freedom within guardrails</li></ul><p><strong>Now let’s talk about the “cons” of slots:</strong></p><ul><li>Slots instances require careful planning to avoid overly complex or vague component designs</li><li>Slots are not ideal for strict system patterns, like notification and messaging usage</li><li>System adopters have a learning curve to understand how to use slots without breaking away from the Design System</li><li>Slots increase Design System maintenance because slots instances must be defined, documentation must be written, and code must be aligned</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: Slots are only available by early access sign-up for paid plans (no starter plan). </em><a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeaZNBEWTahxSYh4FDpUNzQlwM3HKw_Eg0U-hwgXETCtAxm8A/viewform""><em>You can apply for access through Figma’s Google form</em></a><em>, but your plan’s admin must complete the form on your team’s behalf.</em></blockquote><h3>Figma MCP (model context protocol) server</h3><p>Figma’s MCP allows AI tools, like Claude or Cursor, to access information from your Figma files. The MCP creates shared context between design and code, and enables AI to generate component code, tokens, and even documentation straight from your Design System.</p><p>You might be thinking, “What (tf) is an MCP?” Basically, MCPs are a standardized way for AI to communicate with external data and tools, like Figma. So when the MCP server is enabled, AI agents can see your system’s component structure, design tokens, and naming conventions.</p><p><strong>Though MCPs can give AI the same knowledge a seasoned Design System team member has, they should be viewed as assistants versus replacements to human designers.</strong></p><h4>Benefits and limits of MCP</h4><p><strong>An MCP supports Design Systems in the following ways:</strong></p><ul><li>Generates component code based on context in Figma</li><li>Accurately maps design tokens (like colors, spacing, and type)</li><li>Speeds up the documentation workflow by using live Figma context</li><li>Keeps component structure and naming consistent</li></ul><p><strong>But an MCP has limitations for Design Systems, like:</strong></p><ul><li>It can’t read entire projects; it’s better used for small pieces of the system</li><li>It can’t assume interaction behaviors unless you expose and specify it</li><li>Its output still requires review and refinement from seasoned designer/ dev</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Important note<em>: </em></strong><em>The Figma MCP is currently one-way; you can go from Figma to code, but not from code to Figma.</em></blockquote><h4>Set up Figma MCP</h4><p>Figma includes both remote and desktop servers. The remote server (hosted remotely by Figma) is available to all seats and plans, and the desktop server (hosted locally on your computer) is available to Dev and Full seats on paid plans.</p><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: Users with View or Collab seats on paid plans are limited to 6 tool calls per month.</em></blockquote><p><strong>For the remote server:</strong></p><ul><li>Using your preferred development tool (between Claude, Cursor, or VS Code), configure the MCP server with the URL <a href=""https://mcp.figma.com/mcp"">https://mcp.figma.com/mcp</a></li><li>Open a Figma design file from your browser → Switch to Dev mode</li><li>In the right panel, select “Set up Figma MCP” to set up your preferred development tool</li></ul><figure><img alt=""“Set up Figma MCP” button in Figma’s Dev Mode’s right panel to set up the remote server"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4SwOaQ815R74gss4Ptoo5A.png"" /><figcaption>Select “Set up Figma MCP” button in Dev Mode’s right panel</figcaption></figure><p><strong>For the desktop server:</strong></p><ul><li>Go to “Preferences” → Select “Enable desktop MCP server”</li><li>Select your MCP client (like VS Code or Claude)</li><li>Switch to Dev mode → Make sure MCP is enabled in the right panel</li></ul><figure><img alt=""How to select “Enable desktop MCP server” in Figma’s preferences menu"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gDqH_QkiR-7_I66BP7Wglw.png"" /><figcaption>“Enable desktop MCP server” selection in Figma</figcaption></figure><p>For more details on Figma MCP, view <a href=""https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/sections/35280374295831-Figma-MCP-collection"">Figma’s MCP collection</a> for tutorials on setup and best practices.</p><h4>Tips when using an MCP</h4><ul><li>Start with atomic components (like buttons) before trying more complex ones</li><li>Work with one component at a time versus entire projects</li><li>Ask AI to reference any existing components to follow your best practices</li><li>Provide full context (like components behavior and interactions)</li><li>Avoid using hard-coded values or detached components (use the <a href=""https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/801195587640428208/design-lint"">Design Lint plugin</a> to check for missing styles)</li></ul><p><strong>If something looks wrong in the AI output, you can:</strong></p><ul><li>Review the Figma components for errors or missing context, then remediate as needed</li><li>Ask AI to regenerate the component or documentation</li><li>Show AI a screenshot of the issue and ask why something is off (like the padding)</li></ul><p>Figma’s latest updates mark a shift in how Design Systems can scale, maintain consistency, and adapt to product needs.

<h4>An exploration of causes, costs and competitive advantages connected to design maturity in product organisations</h4><figure><img alt=""A dark-themed slide titled “Design Maturity: Moving beyond usability to strategic advantage.” Below the title are three neon-style icons: a document labelled “FAQ” in orange, a central flowchart with the word “GOAL” in blue, and an “Opportunity Service Map” diagram in orange showing connected nodes."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HcVcbXVTWcub1SJiaQPbNA.png"" /></figure><p>High‑performing product organisations depend on maturity across all disciplines — design, product management, engineering, data, editorial, architecture. When one discipline is not being fully utilised, the whole organisation suffers, because maturity is systemic. But design maturity is sometimes misunderstood as a craft issue. Sometimes design is equated with usability. But true design maturity expands an organisation’s capacity to work well in uncertainty. So if you want to create the future, rather than just predict it, you need to find ways to achieve design maturity.</p><h3>Design maturity is more than usability</h3><p>I’m a design leader, so this matters to me personally. But a lack of understanding and investment in design maturity matters to everyone in a product organisation. When one function is underutilised, the entire system suffers. IDEO defines design as “sensemaking + imagination”. It’s the reason design is such a valuable partner to product management — <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/the-value-of-design-in-a-product-organisation-850661d1b22f"">design extends sense-making into difference-making</a>. Product management excels at sense-making. It synthesises data and combines analytical skills with empathy to make decisions and provide direction — ultimately holding accountability for the success of the product. But without design maturity, an organisation can lose out on the creativity and divergent thinking strengths of design. This comes with costs. <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20design/our%20insights/the%20business%20value%20of%20design/mckinsey-bvod-art-digital-rgb.pdf"">McKinsey’s <em>Business Value of Design</em> (2018)</a> found that design maturity correlates directly with financial and product performance.</p><p>But many organisations unconsciously define design too narrowly. The dominance of UX has led many non-designers to conflate and confuse the value of design with interaction design, usability and surface-level detail. Even <a href=""https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/"">Cagan’s model, for example, places design chiefly in the usability domain</a>. This framing is not wrong for managing delivery risk. But it reduces the perceived scope of design’s contribution. We’ve seen this in the past, when <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/"">Jakob Nielsen’s early usability heuristics</a> became the <em>default</em> definition of design work in low-maturity organisations.</p><p>But thinking of design as solely delivering “usability” within this context is limiting. “Usability” is necessary but not sufficient for an organisation to make the most of design. The result is a reduced role focused on UI, interaction flows, accessibility compliance and removing usability risks. This is all important, but it’s table stakes. When design gets trapped here, the organisation is often limited to incremental change. Organisations that use design only as a mechanism for managing usability risks do deliver safe, predictable, incremental improvements. But they might miss category-shifting ideas. They may also find themselves falling back to stakeholders for direction-setting or executing a <a href=""https://psychsafety.com/the-hippo/"">HIPPO’s vision</a>, because they’re underpowered in the skills needed to generate, communicate and manage diverse insights and ideas effectively. They’re likely to be limited to communicating vision in logic-biased prose rather than category shifting poetry that design-enabled product management is capable of.</p><h3>Climbing the ladder…</h3><p>When a product organisation is immature, design is equated with wireframes, flows, accessibility checks or research to eliminate risk. This work is necessary but insufficient for value creation. <a href=""https://ddc.dk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Design-Delivers-How-design-accelerates-your-business.pdf"">The Danish Design Ladder</a> describes how organisations evolve through:</p><ol><li><strong>Non-design</strong> — Design is absent or decorative.</li><li><strong>Design as styling</strong> — Form-giving, surface-level.</li><li><strong>Design as process</strong> — It’s an integrated element of development.</li><li><strong>Design as strategy</strong> — It’s a tool for shaping business models and futures.</li></ol><p>Most product‑influencer narratives peak at level 3 at best. But mature design can go further: into strategy, systems, and the shaping of opportunity itself.</p><p>The Danish Ladder says design will have the biggest impact when it’s deeply embedded in the strategic planning of an organisation. This is because design is a process of translation. Through artefacts, design translates ideas into value-generating products and services. As design undertakes this “translation” it also inevitably transforms ideas, manipulating constraints and capabilities to optimise the design. Design is therefore most effective when it’s able to influence both problem-framing and solutioning at the strategy level. Design isn’t art. It’s a process for solving real problems for real people by understanding them and getting creative to make progress and a positive difference.</p><p>When design is only allowed to operate at surface levels, or even when it’s called on to “execute” a strategy, you’re missing out on potential value. To non-designers this point might feel like “discipline inflation.” I get it, we all want to feel important. We all want a seat at the table. We all want to argue that we’re the secret to competitive advantage and need to “hold the pen” on the strategy. I don’t think that’s true for design in every context. The sense-making, convergent tendencies of product management mean that in most cases design shouldn’t be the dominant decision-maker in a product organisation. But they should be included in strategic work — and work that is most ambiguous — for the simple reason that designers are brilliant at having and managing ideas.</p><h3><strong>Idea management: The missing discipline?</strong></h3><p>Design is a systematic, creative, opportunity-generating discipline. When organisations misunderstand it as only enabling usability risk-management, they prevent themselves from operating at higher maturity. Organising around risk (value, usability, feasibility, viability) is sensible. But risk management isn’t the whole job. If you only reduce risk, you only reduce possibility.</p><p>Designers are trained to expand possibility and enable delivery by moving fluidly between divergence and convergence. A mature design practice surfaces new possibilities from research, signals, or anomalies. It looks across journeys, systems, and time — not just features. It detects patterns that suggest new value. It turns weak signals into opportunity areas. All of these core competencies of a skilled product designer are powerful and valuable — but so far, they’re not particularly unique to design. In some cases, they may even be more naturally suited to the convergent mindset of a product manager. But design does bring something extra. Design is a structured discipline for managing ideas. It doesn’t just detect patterns — it invents new ones. And it turns weak signals not just into opportunity areas, but into articulated opportunities that other disciplines can experience and understand quickly and cheaply to collaborate. Design done well looks like:</p><ul><li>Divergence (exploring many possibilities)</li><li>Convergence (narrowing to the strongest)</li><li>Visualisation (making intangible futures and assumptions visible and testable)</li><li>Iteration (enriching ideas through critique)</li><li>Integration (seeing relationships as systems and experiences emerge)</li></ul><p>Let’s look at the impact that this can have in practice…</p><h4><strong>Three hypothetical approaches</strong></h4><p>Imagine three different approaches to the same project. The context is high in ambiguity. The market context is highly competitive. To operate effectively the organisation needs to combine multiple talents, each with their own levels of maturity and different cultures. Likewise, the technical landscape is complex with a mixture of technical debt and emerging technologies that few in the team have experience of using. We step into the multiverse and see how three teams might approach the task:</p><p>Team A starts their discovery and execution by a PM creating a strong, detailed PRFAQ. It places users right at the centre of a story of the future. This sharpens the narrative across disciplines. It’s an inspiring picture that teams can get behind, so it<strong> a</strong>ligns stakeholders around a single vision. The FAQ section answers the questions that are front of mind. But the document imagines an end‑state rather than discovers one. It privileges linear, verbal thinkers who love prose. It’s like a piece of rhetoric, so it also risks a false certainty.</p><p>Team B create a detailed and comprehensive Opportunity Solution Tree (OST). It allows them to multi-track, exploring data and customer conversations to build an abstract map of opportunities. The team attaches data to branches to help prioritise the biggest opportunities and they work along branches, logically validating opportunities and bringing design skills in to generate possibilities. The team works on it together, collaboratively, sharing perspectives and having rich conversations amongst themselves and with users. It encourages exploration before convergence. And it helps the team track evidence and hypotheses together. But it’s weak at representing lived experience or systemic relationships — it’s an abstraction of a problem space. Sometimes the team struggles to navigate the structure of the ever-expanding tree. And it’s hard to hold the whole structure in your head at once. It makes systems thinking, journey‑based context, understanding time and flow harder, because it’s natively hierarchical rather than relational.</p><p>Team BBC is led by a skilled leader, experienced in multidisciplinary collaboration including design. They like the multi-tracking divergence and evidence-based decision-making of the OST, but they think that can make it even stronger. They create an Opportunity Service Map. It’s a shared artefact that still operates at an abstract level but brings the product landscape to life — it helps the team visualise experiences before, during and after customers interact with the product. It helps teams understand the experience and the backstage systems that power it. They talk to users, feeding in insight and operating with empathy. The team works collaboratively, as they do with the OST, but now they overlay opportunities directly onto a service blueprint. They’re curious, so they sidestep the “<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/teresatorres_continuousdiscoveryhabits-curseofknowledge-activity-7203470831937613825-vXO8/"">curse of knowledge</a>.” They start with problems and “why” questions, then they move to lo-fi ideation. They work collaboratively using techniques like <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/learn-how-to-use-the-best-ideation-methods-scamper?srsltid=AfmBOoqX9Jcf5a_86yRXxXxYHI2rBgB0r09EfY6vqnIzHcjoUEV84eb0"">SCAMPER</a> to explore and refine ideas. Then they prototype — they select the method depending on the concept and what assumptions they need to investigate. They regularly create cheap sacrificial concepts and test with users. Because the Opportunity Service Map shows frontstage, backstage, enablers, time, friction, confidence and impact it connects ideas and assumptions to the reality they operate in. This keeps exploration broad yet situated.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LzNFN2DEfGWpjG6c3stA2w.png"" /><figcaption>Limiting the impact of design to usability and execution is risky business. Divergence and convergence and a cocktail of multidisciplinary collaboration will usually lead to better results. But the top performing teams understand where and how design can add most value.</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Immaturity in one discipline hurts the whole system</strong></h3><p>The best teams I’ve ever worked in operate more like Team BBC. Teams A and B exhibit many strengths of an effective product team. But Team A’s design immaturity forces them to execute a vision that is handed to them. When a team uses a PRFAQ to translate customer obsession and insight into action, it’s a brilliant way to ensure decisions in delivery align with a coherent user outcome. But teams first need to be able to generate this insight and have invented a vision of how to meet it. A PRFAQ is evidence of the synthesising power of product management. It can boost accountability and provide a single-threaded leader with a contract to fulfil. But it won’t help you create.</p><p>Product management isn’t about managing a static thing — we’re managing not only what the product is and how it’s performing now, we’re often managing what it can and should become in the future. Product teams are responsible for delivery and discovery. Design maturity is so powerful because it introduces comfort and competence in dealing with the ambiguity of invention.</p><p>OSTs are therefore a signal of increased design maturity because they help encourage teams to work “outwards as well as backwards” — diverging and multitracking. This looks more like design — moving forwards <em>and</em> backwards, diverging and converging across multiple tracks, iterating to refine and optimise. Once you add in creating artefacts that act as experiments as you make progress, you see how and where design adds value.</p><p>Design helps teams explore from the present into multiple plausible futures before committing to one. An organisation without maturity in design might only ever develop the competence to work backwards from a chosen future or execute with an inherited or fixed set of constraints. With design maturity an organisation is much more likely to be able to blend the talents of product management and engineering with design to work forwards and backwards, manipulating problem-framing and solution-making to help the organisation find the most valuable future, no matter their context.</p><figure><img alt=""A side-by-side graphic comparing the Stacey Matrix and the Cynefin Framework. The left panel shows the Stacey Matrix with four zones — Simple, Complicated, Complex and Chaotic — arranged along axes of agreement and certainty. The right panel shows the Cynefin Framework with its five domains — Clear, Complicated, Complex, Chaotic, and Confused — displayed as a cross-shaped diagram with brief guidance on how to act in each domain."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ydkg8peuMaITWGYW_0e2Fw.png"" /><figcaption>Both the Stacey Matrix and Cynefin describe the different contexts a product organisation is likely to operate in — and they suggest how process might need to flex to increase the chance of team success.</figcaption></figure><p>Modern organisations operate across multiple contexts. Mature product teams know that some work is simple or complicated and work through it accordingly. The most mature teams can also identify and operate in complexity and chaos. To work well in complex domains you need strong, confident disciplines, distributed decision-making and a willingness to explore unknowns.</p><p>When design maturity is low, the whole organisation becomes less capable of operating in uncertainty. Product management might end up filling the gap — but you’re likely to have fewer, weaker ideas. Not because product managers and other disciplines can’t have ideas, but because design as a discipline has evolved to manage them most effectively. Each discipline has a core strength and purpose. This is why you need design — because it adds unique and valuable skills and because immaturity in one part becomes immaturity everywhere, as everyone is forced to generalise to fill the gap.</p><p>We can look at two helpful models to understand this further. Robert Kegan’s theory of adult development describes how people evolve in their “mental complexity” — their ability to reconcile ambiguity and competing truths. At the Socialised Mind, identity and direction are shaped by the expectations of others. Decisions are anchored in fitting in, meeting external standards and aligning with prevailing norms.</p><p>At the Self-Authoring Mind, individuals develop an internal compass. They can understand and appreciate the expectations of others while also generating their own frameworks for judgement and action.</p><p>A smaller group shift further into the Self-Transforming Mind, where they can integrate multiple frames at once and work flexibly in paradox, ambiguity and change. Kegan talks about individuals. But I think you can use these stages to describe teams.</p><figure><img alt=""A diagram showing Robert Kegan’s three stages of adult development — Socialised Mind, Self-Authoring Mind, and Self-Transforming Mind — mapped along a horizontal timeline. Each stage includes traits such as reliance on external expectations, developing an internal compass, and integrating multiple perspectives. The diagram also includes brief labels describing how leaders operate at each stage. Kegan talks about these levels in the context of personal development in his book An Everyone Culture."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kUuz2i-GCGtp-gfyfEXscg.png"" /></figure><p>A multidisciplinary team mirrors these stages. A Socialised-level team performs competently within the dominant discipline’s worldview (often PM or engineering). They optimise for alignment and predictability — they “organise to execute”. A Self-Authoring team begins to define its own integrated way of working across disciplines by co-creating a shared approach grounded in collective purpose and context — they’re empowered to solve problems. A Self-Transforming team goes further: it can switch modes depending on the problem space — convergent when needed, divergent when needed, exploratory in uncertainty, decisive in clarity — they’re <strong>empowered to find problems</strong> and invent the future.</p><p>Operating in ambiguity demands high maturity across disciplines. The lowest common denominator of people playing multiple roles or the over-dominance of a single discipline won’t work. Strength and maturity in each discipline is required, so that the organisation and its teams aren’t trapped by any one discipline’s identity but can metabolise all of them to meet the moment. When teams mature to this point, they stop behaving as a collection of functions and start operating as an adaptive system capable of solving harder, more ambiguous problems than any discipline could manage alone.</p><p>Kegan’s developmental lens pairs naturally with Amy Edmondson’s work on psychological safety and teaming. Edmondson argues that in environments of high uncertainty and high interdependence teams perform best when members can speak up, question assumptions, surface risks, and integrate diverse perspectives without fear. That’s only possible when individuals move beyond the Socialised Mindset and when the team behaves at a Self-Authoring or even Self-Transforming level — able to adapt how it works together.</p><h4>Building maturity</h4><p>When design is strong, every discipline benefits. In simple or complicated contexts, disciplines can operate independently and with lower levels of maturity. Product management can set a goal, engineering can implement with rigour, design can ensure usability. But as complexity increases, the future stops being something you predict and starts being something that emerges from interaction. At a certain point, predicting becomes riskier than designing. No discipline has the full picture. You need the exploration, translation and reframing muscles that design brings — finding gaps and opportunities, making ideas tangible, and helping the team update its understanding of the problem, the constraints and what’s possible. At its best, design surfaces opportunities before they calcify into problems, synthesises research into multi-level insights, prototypes to explore strategy (not just UI), and connects journeys, systems and stories into experiences that actually matter. It helps shape direction alongside PM, engineering, editorial, data and architecture — but only when it’s included early enough, high enough and meaningfully enough.</p><p>Maturity rarely develops evenly across an organisation. But you can accelerate the maturity of design by involving and empowering designers where ambiguity, opportunity and risk are highest. These are the areas where linear planning breaks down, expertise alone stops being enough, and teams need experimentation, creativity and distributed judgement.</p><p>Simple shifts can bring greater design maturity to an organisation:</p><ul><li>investing in framing as well as solving</li><li>intentionally cycling through divergence and convergence</li><li>mapping opportunities into the systems they live within</li><li>critiquing ideas to sharpen, not to narrow — and to build rather than diminish creative confidence</li><li>pairing narrative tools (PRFAQ) with experiential ones (prototypes) and making richer abstractions of opportunity spaces — finding ways to show, not just tell people what the future should be like.</li></ul><p>Importantly, these shifts don’t weaken other disciplines — they strengthen them. They help PM and engineering build design literacy without forcing those teams to compensate for an underpowered design function.</p><p>Design maturity isn’t about risk reduction; it’s about strategic advantage. It helps organisations spot new value early and gives teams the confidence to pursue it. If you expect your organisation to shape the future, not just survive it, your teams need the maturity to discover, deliver <strong><em>and</em></strong> design what comes next. The future we prefer won’t arrive ready-made — it will be built by the organisations that design it.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9f45fd4e20c3"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/why-you-need-design-maturity-in-a-product-organisation-and-how-to-get-it-9f45fd4e20c3"">Why you need design maturity in a product organisation, and how to get it</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

For our users, applying these principles and laws translates into simpler, more intuitive interactions and a smoother overall experience.</p><p>What may seem like ordinary observations or best practices from experienced designers are, in fact, scientific findings from the world of psychology. Researches we can easily integrate into our work to make our users’ journey much simpler. Today we’re going to talk about:</p><ul><li>Hick–Hyman Law</li><li>Cognitive Load Theory</li><li>Fitts’s Law</li></ul><p>Briefly, without unnecessary fluff. But I’ll allow myself to add to the dry definitions not just examples from Apple designers, who are almost always a great source of inspiration for beginners. I’d like to bring this down to an everyday level we all encounter, so you can explain these laws even to a 6-year-old. We’ll take a walk through the restaurants in your neighborhood and see what they can teach us.</p><h3>Hick–Hyman Law</h3><p>Many of us, myself included, have probably found ourselves sitting in a restaurant, staring at a menu for far too long, unable to decide what to order. This usually happens when the menu is extensive and the dishes don’t differ much from one another.</p><p>The reason behind this lies in the <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/hicks-law/""><em>Hick–Hyman Law</em></a>, which states that <strong>the time required to make a decision increases with the number of available choices.</strong> In other words, the more options we offer our users, the harder it becomes for them to make a confident decision and the longer it takes.</p><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._Hick"">William Edmund Hick</a>, in his study <a href=""https://www2.psychology.uiowa.edu/faculty/mordkoff/InfoProc/pdfs/Hick%201952.pdf""><em>On the Rate of Gain of Information</em></a>, examines entropy and bits in the context of perception. Through his experiment, he concludes that human perception functions as a channel through which information flows, and the capacity of this channel is limited. Therefore, the more bits of information that need to be transmitted, the longer the transmission will take.</p><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Hyman"">Ray Hyman</a>, in his subsequent article <a href=""https://www2.psychology.uiowa.edu/faculty/mordkoff/InfoProc/pdfs/Hyman%201953.pdf""><em>Stimulus Information as a Determinant of Reaction Time</em></a>, not only experimentally confirms Hick’s findings but also refines them. He adds that not only the amount of information but also different combinations of information chunks influence the speed at which it is transmitted. This is how the Hick–Hyman Law was born.</p><figure><img alt=""A black-and-white photo of a man standing at a podium (left) addressing an audience, with three panelists seated at a long table behind him."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*uI4-UKceI6xHWEjO.jpg"" /><figcaption>Ray Hyman by Robert Sheaffer. <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=24738861"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>The restaurant industry uses this law consciously: for instance, high-end restaurants often limit the number of dishes on their menu to reduce decision time and the stress that customers experience at the moment of choice.</p><p>But both approaches work. It all depends on the business model.<br />Lower-priced restaurants rely on the idea that you’ll order as many dishes and snacks as possible. Given the lower prices, the time spent browsing the menu can actually increase the average check, which is why they’ll often leave an extra menu on your table, inviting you to keep exploring.</p><figure><img alt=""Big menu on a wall of small restaurant"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/715/0*azhh8mbVmuKteBzz.jpg"" /><figcaption>Example of big menu. <a href=""https://favbulous.com/post/7102/secret-tips-and-tricks-behind-a-restaurant-menu"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>In “fancy restaurants”, however, it’s much harder to raise the average check this way. The focus shifts instead to creating a memorable experience that makes the guest want to return. And to do that, the goal is to pull the customer away from the menu as early as possible and start “delivering the show”: the sommelier, the open kitchen, the service, the atmosphere. It’s all part of the same psychological choreography.</p><p>We can apply the same logic to the world of design. For example, by hiding secondary filters under an accordion, we can reduce the delay before the first user action by roughly one-third.</p><p>Apple uses a similar principle. On their website, you can’t compare more than three products at once. You’re always making a choice among a maximum of three options. For Apple, the time from the start of the user flow to the moment of purchase is one of a key metrics and offering more alternatives would only slow down decision-making.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of compare function on Apple Website"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*A0aIHqR3VhkhNDbstU6xSA.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot of compare function (<a href=""https://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/"">Apple.com</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3>Cognitive Load Theory</h3><p>Of course, I think the title already gives it away. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sweller"">John Sweller</a> in <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1207/s15516709cog1202_4""><em>Cognitive Load During Problem Solving: Effects on Learning</em></a> states that <strong>our working memory is limited </strong>and this directly affects both how we process information and how we make decisions. In other words according to <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/cognitive-load/"">Cognitive Load Theory</a> we’re not comfortable solving large or complex problems all at once.</p><figure><img alt=""Smiling elderly man wearing glasses outdoors."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*XrUIXxGR10nXSjay.png"" /><figcaption>John Sweller. <a href=""https://neshnikolic.com/podcast/john-sweller"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Have you ever noticed that when you go to an upscale restaurant, the food menu and the wine list are presented separately and often by different people? The waiter handles the main menu, while the sommelier, trained specifically to guide and advise on wine, takes care of the rest.</p><figure><img alt=""Sommelier pours the wine into a decanter."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*QBPkjrpYmM4HIAcT.jpg"" /><figcaption>Sommelier pours the wine into a decanter. <a href=""https://hospitalityinsights.ehl.edu/psychology-role-design-michelin-star-restaurant-wine-menu"">Image Sourse</a></figcaption></figure><p>Even in more casual restaurants, the waiter usually approaches the table with a specific question: “Have you decided what you’d like to drink?”</p><p>For context: I live in Germany, and this is a standard part of the customer flow here. In my home culture, however, the question usually goes the other way around: “Have you decided what you’d like to eat?” but not what to drink. So I often catch German waiters off guard when I say: “Please come back later for the drinks, but I’m ready to order the food.”</p><p>But the real lesson here is that everyone in this process knows their role and timing. You’re not expected to make all your choices at once. You start by focusing on the drinks (a small, simple decision) and only afterward the waiter gives you additional time to choose your meal.</p><p>And, of course, in design we try to take this natural limitation of the brain into account. That’s why we often split long registration forms into three short steps. This way, the user isn’t overwhelmed by a wall of questions on a single page. Instead, they move through the process gradually, with focused attention at each step, which reduces cognitive load and increases completion rates.</p><p>Or take Apple, for example. When you’ve already compared three different devices, chosen your new desired iPhone, and clicked the Buy button, a new quest begins: the configuration page.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Product configuration page on Apple Website"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*e_S70WT8ETmQiK3Gs6xxZw.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot of Configuration page (<a href=""https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-air"">Apple.com</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The magic of this page lies in the fact that you’re never asked one big, abstract question like “What do you want?”. Instead, you’re guided through a series of small, sequential choices, where each step is a separate task. The entire process is designed to prevent you from overthinking how your final selection will look. Everything unfolds gradually, with minimal complexity, and without showing all the options at once.</p><p>And even when we can see several questions on the page at once, they make all inactive options unselectable, as if showing us the only correct path for configuring the device.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Product configuration page on Apple Website"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BdOC6Wc7jdYKQHWsQL90YQ.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot of Configuration page (<a href=""https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-air"">Apple.com</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Apple, in general, uses plenty of clever tricks to sell us what they want us to buy, rather than what we initially came for. One good example is the Pricing Ladder a tactic perfectly explained by MKBHD in a <a href=""https://youtube.com/shorts/NiNYOZZLOyg?si=kw9xYmQvrJhdcjA4"">one-minute video</a> that I highly recommend watching before you buy your next Apple device.</p><p>At the same time, other companies can use these techniques against us, essentially bombarding us with constant stimuli and information. Take the AliExpress app, for example. Before you even reach the actual products, you’re overloaded. You’ll see a spinning prize wheel three times, be told about two free gifts, be invited to play a game to win an extra discount, and only after all these circles of hell will you finally reach the main page. And even there, you’re hit with a dozen more psychological triggers, all carefully designed to wear down your cognitive defenses and fill your cart with things you never intended to buy.</p><figure><img alt=""Product page showing wireless earbuds with charging case on Temu."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9fi-SRlclHTlZely7ctCYA.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot of overwhelming Product page (<a href=""https://www.temu.com/-new-wireless-earbuds-for-running-sports-wireless-earphones-with-earhooks-pure--sound-over-ear-headphones-enc-noise-cancelling-with-dual-led-display-earphones-built-in-microphone-g-601099512659332.html?_oak_mp_inf=EIT7tJem1ogBGhZmbGFzaF9zYWxlX2xpc3RfejFqNjkxILuFwt%2BtMw%3D%3D&amp;top_gallery_url=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.kwcdn.com%2Fproduct%2F1e23310424%2F15bb81f1-bb50-420f-88da-13f8b03f85c7_1600x1600.jpeg&amp;spec_gallery_id=601099512659332&amp;refer_page_sn=10132&amp;refer_source=0&amp;freesia_scene=116&amp;_oak_freesia_scene=116&amp;_oak_rec_ext_1=MjM0NQ&amp;refer_page_el_sn=201401&amp;_x_channel_src=1&amp;_x_channel_scene=spike&amp;_x_sessn_id=dfl5866dsz&amp;refer_page_name=lightning-deals&amp;refer_page_id=10132_1764626564415_d6jkn51kcm"">Temu</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The same approach is used by Temu and other simillar apps. Some might say this is just a regional design style common in Asian markets, but I’d counter that argument with Candy Crush, which uses the same cognitive overload mechanics and was created by a Swedish company for a Western audience.</p><h3>Fitts’s Law</h3><p><strong>The time it takes for a person to reach or interact with a target depends on the distance to the target and its size</strong>, according to <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/fittss-law/"">Fitts’s Law</a><em>. </em>The closer and larger the target is, the faster and easier it is to click or tap on it.</p><p>In his article <a href=""https://www2.psychology.uiowa.edu/faculty/mordkoff/infoproc/pdfs/Fitts%201954.pdf""><em>The Information Capacity of the Human Motor System in Controlling the Amplitude of Movement</em></a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Fitts"">Paul Fitts</a> not only quantitatively measured the influence of target size and distance on the action performed with it, but also argued that the motor–nervous system has a limited processing capacity, which imposes constraints on the speed and accuracy of our reactions.</p><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white portrait of a man in a suit and bow tie."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2-lVJtDadnVMpeyttm_8jw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Paul M.

Since this option is physically close to the customer and visually prominent, it perfectly satisfies both conditions of Fitts’s Law: proximity and target size.</p><figure><img alt=""Hard Rock table tent dessert menu display featuring sundaes and milkshake bites."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*baWG3S9OxBQ3P_5o.jpg"" /><figcaption>Table Tent. <a href=""https://www.behance.net/gallery/20475989/Hardrock-Cafe-tent-cards"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Let’s take Apple again as an example. When we walk into an Apple Store, we see a large number of devices neatly arranged on tables. And there’s a clear logic behind how they’re placed, including the influence of Fitts’s Law.</p><figure><img alt=""Modern tech store interior with display tables, staff, and a central glass staircase."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/816/0*F_ia-vEjHfQ52Tlh.jpg"" /><figcaption>Apple Store on 5th Avenue. <a href=""https://www.apple.com/de/newsroom/2019/09/apple-fifth-avenue-the-cube-is-back/"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Notice the height of the tables and the way the devices are positioned: everything is arranged so that it’s as easy and natural as possible for you to reach out and touch them. After all, the store’s primary goal isn’t just to sell devices, it’s to let you experience them. Ideally, Apple wants you to pick them up, test the new iPhone Pro or Air, listen to the headphones, or sketch on an iPad. Apple designs the entire environment so that you never have to stretch or hesitate. The devices seem to magically fall into your hands.</p><h3>Bringing it all together</h3><p>We saw how limiting the number of choices can accelerate decision-making, how breaking complex processes into smaller steps can reduce cognitive strain, and how proximity and scale can influence the speed and ease of action.</p><p>From restaurant menus to digital interfaces, from Apple’s carefully guided flows to AliExpress’s sensory chaos, the same psychological mechanisms are at play.

Maybe it’s the separation from the human energy of urban centres. Or maybe it’s simply excitement for where I’m heading today.</p><p>I join the commuters spilling out into the surrounding streets like a burst dam, meandering through buses, traffic lights and signposts. As I walk further, the torrents thin as people are absorbed into glass fronted offices and revolving doors, until it feels like I’m the last one walking.</p><p>Suddenly, in front of me, the gothic towers of Westminster Abbey rise up. I ponder the pioneering architects who imagined it, and the brave souls who built it. I consider the sovereigns it’s crowned, wedded and mourned, and the wonderful sense of awe it’s provided through the ages.</p><p>Before I’ve taken a dozen more steps, I hear the famous chimes of Big Ben. It appears behind the Abbey, a golden marvel glittering in the gloom, and standing guard to the adjoining Houses of Parliament. I wonder what it’s like to bear witness to some of Britain’s most profound moments and movements.</p><p>It’s the perfect introduction to my purpose today: the 2nd <a href=""https://journalofbiophilicdesign.com/biophilic-design-conference"">Biophilic Design Conference</a> in Central Hall Westminster, London. A wonderful event that brings together the world’s leading architects, interior designers, urban planners, creatives and innovators — with a mission to create a healthier, more resilient and regenerative world.</p><p>Here are my reflections on a day spent exploring a vibrant, biophilic future.</p><h3>There’s a shifting mindset to systemic change.</h3><p>The first clue arrived in the theme of the day: <em>“Biophilic Design for a Regenerative Future”</em>.</p><p>Sustainability is out! Regeneration is in! But the distinction is an important one. Regenerative design goes beyond traditional sustainability ambitions to create systems and structures that cause a net-positive impact on both environment and society.</p><p>In simpler terms, rather than finding a point of equilibrium, it recognises the damage we’ve done to our natural ecosystems and seeks to both restore and regenerate those systems.</p><p>Regenerative design also recognises the viewpoint that human and natural systems are deeply interwoven and interconnected. The global crises we face today such as climate, biodiversity loss and mental health are not standalone issues, but symptoms of a deeper disconnection between humanity and nature.</p><p>I loved this quote from Donella Meadows, author of <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Thinking-Systems-Primer-Donella-Meadows/dp/1603580557"">Thinking in Systems</a>, as shared by Luke Engleback in his talk about ecourbanism<em>:</em></p><blockquote>“Systems happen all at once. They are connected not just in one direction, but in many directions simultaneously.”</blockquote><p>As the day progresses, it’s clear that this mindset shift is still evolving. Many talks tend to zoom in towards individual crises like climate — whereas the real predicament to overcome remains our systemic disconnection from nature.</p><p><em>(If you’re interested in exploring more about the processes and thinking behind regenerative design, I found </em><a href=""https://medium.com/@ernesto-87727/the-art-of-regenerative-design-26bde27f72f8""><em>this article</em></a><em> a really good starting point).</em></p><h3>“There’s no such thing as neutral space.”</h3><p>If there’s one takeaway from the whole day, — and indeed the keynote from <a href=""https://www.farrowpartners.ca/"">Tye Farrow</a>, leading architect and author of the wonderful book <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Constructing-Health-Built-Environment-Enhances/dp/1487557221"">Constructing Health</a> — I think it’s this.</p><p>I love the simplicity of the message. That our built environment will take us one of two ways: it can undermine health, or it can cause health. It’s a phrase that encourages action in a subtle yet profound manner.</p><figure><img alt=""Outside terracing beneath a beautiful, curved, wooden structure designed by Farrow Partners"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QdyzpwegHyTmMPWdr5WWfQ.png"" /><figcaption>SZMC Helmsley Cancer Center, Israel (Credit: Farrow Partners)</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve read Tye’s book, which has become a feature on my desk over the past 12 months. It’s the best summary I’ve found for exploring the very nature of biophilic and salutogenic design through architectural research that draws on fields including environmental psychology and neuroscience. It’s also a beautiful publication.</p><p>Tye’s focus on health is a critical reminder not just of the core focus of biophilic design, but what <em>all</em> design could be — and its basis in the natural world.</p><p>Architects are the undisputed forerunners, but there’s plenty of industries <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/5-biophilic-ux-solutions-for-a-sustainable-future-5d58a217649c"">exploring this further.</a></p><h3>Focusing on children is both heart-warming and mission critical.</h3><p>I found it incredibly moving to hear of wonderful businesses and approaches focused on offering the youngest minds of our world the experiences for a different future.</p><p>Adam White and Andrée Davies, founders of <a href=""https://www.davieswhite.co.uk/"">Davies-White Ltd</a>, are landscape architects specialising in nature-connected family friendly landscapes and gardens, created through the use of natural, sustainable materials. Their work exemplified how biophilic projects can capture the attention of leading advocates of the natural world, such as Sir David Attenborough and the Princess of Wales, but most importantly, how these biophilic spaces empower children.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vxDYbodWXa1aOcuit3nVWw.png"" /><figcaption>The Wild Garden at Caudwell International Children’s Centre at Keele University, supporting children with developmental disabilities (Credit: Davies-White Ltd)</figcaption></figure><p>Similarly, it was brilliant to see <a href=""https://www.theschoolofbiophilia.co.uk/"">School of Biophilia</a> exhibiting — inspired, I’m told, by last year’s conference. Their focus is on sharing the power of biophilia to connect people with the natural world, focused not just on schools, but also businesses and workplaces too.</p><p>For me, it was a timely reminder that nature reconnection is a long term mission that arguably requires the young more than any other demographic. And given our connections with nature are often forged in childhood, it’s a critical area of focus for today.</p><h3>Cities can drive change. But it shouldn’t stop there.</h3><p>Figures shared from the World Economic Forum’s BiodiverCities project attribute cities being responsible for 80% of global GDP. They also contribute around 75% of greenhouse gases, and consume 75% of natural resources. When you consider they house 54% of the global population, the imbalance is clear.</p><p>From an urban planning and architectural perspective, I can understand why cities present a major opportunity for change. As Nick Grayson, former Climate Change Sustainability and Green City Manager at Birmingham City Council shared:</p><blockquote>“Nature underpins the whole growth and quality of life agenda yet most cities see nature as a maintenance issue and a cut-able budget”.</blockquote><p>Birmingham was already seen as one of Europe’s greener cities, but through the lens of the <a href=""https://www.millenniumassessment.org/en/index.html"">Millenium Ecosystem Assessment</a>, uncovered critical need to improve the quality, size and connectedness of its green spaces to ensure nature provided wider societal benefits in areas like wellbeing, climate resilience, and managing economic risk.</p><figure><img alt=""Curving pathway covered by a deep canopy of trees"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DSsmEFPtFejzDl_SQFpL1g.png"" /><figcaption>City of Nature Plan (Credit: Bimingham City Council)</figcaption></figure><p>It’s response was to trail blaze a new governance model for cities to place nature at the heart of their overall strategy. Nature now lies at the centre of the whole council plan — including housing, children, health and jobs — and helped Birmingham to the exciting accolade of becoming the UK’s first “<a href=""https://naturallybirmingham.org/birmingham-city-of-nature-delivery-framework/"">City of Nature</a>”.</p><p>As Rob Delius, Head of Sustainability at design practice <a href=""https://stridetreglown.com/"">Stride Treglown</a>, shared whilst drawing on the example of Singapore:</p><blockquote>“Cities can completely reimagine themselves as a city in nature.”</blockquote><h3>But what about the indoors?</h3><p>Plans to transform cities into truly biophilic spaces are incredibly exciting and urgently required. But there’s clearly a need to go further, and <em>inside</em> these spaces too.</p><p>The average person spends 90% of their time <em>indoors</em> (a much travelled figure now decades old but rarely disputed). It’s where most of us spend a whopping <em>22 hours</em> of our day working, resting and sleeping.</p><p>It’s our indoor spaces that offer the ripest opportunity for paradigm-shifting change, if we get it right. Digital interventions are one route that can magic the ultimate biophilic experiences through personal, scalable and effective nature-powered spaces to transform health and performance.</p><p>It also leans into another topic that came up a number of times in conversations I had at the conference — the importance of designing for neurodiversity.</p><p>As our understanding around conditions like ADHD and autism improve, it reveals how poor certain spaces are for supporting these people. Leaning into digital offers up new opportunities for personalising individual spaces to suit different types of people, tasks and needs with effortless ease.</p><h3>Artificial intelligence can support natural intelligence.</h3><p>Beyond <a href=""https://www.moodsonic.com/"">Moodsonic</a>, a generative soundscape creator for workplaces, hospitals and education, I’m not sure I heard AI mentioned once at the conference.</p><p>This exclusion felt neither deliberate nor coincidental, but perhaps further symptomatic of a world where humanity and nature do remain extraordinarily separate.</p><p>There’s no doubt AI can be a major accelerant for the biophilic design movement. It’s not about competing with nature but creating meaningful ways to interweave its magic with our daily lives.</p><p>Visuals, sounds, air quality, lighting and temperature all contribute to the “feel” of our environments, impacting the way we think, feel and behave. They can increasingly be measured, assessed and recreated, ultimately crafting adaptive environments that offer direct evidence-based health interventions, and can instantly respond to our changing physiological needs.</p><p>It will help close the gap between design intent and real-world outcomes — bringing more science into the art of design. It can help create spaces that don’t just <em>feel</em> biophilic, but are <em>quantifiably</em> biophilic too.</p><p>There’s a lot to talk about here, and we’ll undoubtedly see and hear much more in future months of wonderful examples where AI has helped unlock some truly innovative biophilic solutions.</p><h3>We’re still stuck with numbers.</h3><p>One of the recurring frustrations I’ve heard from members of the biophilic design community is despite the long-standing and irrefutable evidence in support of biophilic design, it still struggles to scale.</p><figure><img alt=""Tropical plants contained within a large spherical dome"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_e4yWEHYbLs8eCYqhGaJiw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Places like the plant-filled spheres at Amazon’s Head Offices, Seattle, are rare and expensive (Credit: <a href=""https://www.dezeen.com/2018/01/30/plant-filled-seattle-spheres-open-amazon-headquarters/"">Dezeen</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>As summarised by Oliver Health, founder of design consultancy <a href=""https://www.oliverheathdesign.com/"">Oliver Health Design</a>, biophilic design remains silo’d by factors including cost, education, research adoption, regulation and procurement.</p><p>But I also think it remains misunderstood outside the industry. Beyond the numbers of percentage uplifts in productivity, wellbeing and performance — which come from environmental psychologists, architectural practices and design businesses, lie <em>human</em> stories. And we’re less good at making these the heroes of our ambitions.</p><p>To draw on Nick Grayson once more, he touched on the power of seeking “Earth Stories” to both engage locals in plans to transform Birmingham into a true “City of Nature” and to draw out people’s own realisations of the proximity of nature to people’s own faith, quality of life and way of living.</p><p>The power of storytelling is something I’ve learned a lot from my time at <a href=""http://portal.app/experience"">Portal</a>. We’ve tried to avoid dry statistics of how Portal might make people feel “27% less stressed”, or help “83% of customers sleep better”, in favour of sharing genuine, wholesome customer stories.</p><p>We’ve heard of Portal being used from childbirth to end-of-life care, to create the most beautiful and dignified experiences. We’re heard of its usage in war zones like Ukraine to protect children from the sounds of bombs landing on their city, and help them find sleep. We’ve heard of Portal helping customers manage challenging conditions like psychosis, narcolepsy and autism.</p><p>We humans are a species that communicate through stories. If we’re to create products and experiences that connect people with the natural world, then its stories — not stats — that we should champion to spread our message.</p><h3>Our biophilic future requires a connection of hearts and minds.</h3><p>Reflecting on the day, I find myself returning to the Birmingham example once more, and the realisation that their green city had so much more headroom to grow.</p><blockquote>“Birmingham’s nature wasn’t big enough, joined up enough or high enough quality to be able to reach all its citizens to give them wellbeing. It wasn’t sufficient to stand up to climate resilience and risk, and put the city at economic risk. We knew we had to do something.”</blockquote><p>I feel the same about our biophilic community. The day shared countless examples of brilliant projects, businesses and initiatives, and I hope the next 12 months sees more of us collaborate in the name of health and nature connection.</p><p>To take the NHS as an example, there were plenty of examples throughout the day of the application of biophilic principles in care, treatment and recovery settings, but I could feel the frustration at the difficulty of rolling out these successes at greater scale.</p><p>In my mind, the key challenge is to shift <em>hearts and minds</em> — of decision makers, creators and communities. Our strongest hand to achieve this is by continuing to create the most incredible experiences, sharing the human stories of transformation that lie behind them, and collaborating.</p><p>I hope, driven by values in community and connection, we can continue to surface more evidence and inspiration to improve the quality of what we do, and ensure nature-powered design spreads deeper across all industries.</p><p>With nature, we have a beautiful, wise and magical companion — it’s time to rediscover that flourishing future together.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=d896346da3c3"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/biophilic-design-is-the-wellness-revolution-happening-all-around-us-d896346da3c3"">Biophilic design is the wellness revolution happening all around us</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4><strong>How outdated decision logics are undermining Labour’s ambitions for a mission-driven government.</strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Illustration depicting A to B problem-solving which ignores the complexity around us."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*OlV0rTXNIS06whCZ.png"" /><figcaption>Image credit: <a href=""https://www.businessillustrator.com/"">Virpi Oinonen</a></figcaption></figure><p>Given Labour won the last general election on the promise of national renewal and a mission-driven state with a “relentless focus on long-term ends” after years of crisis management — frustration is understandable. After the Budget this week, it feels as if political ambition has met the practical reality of sustaining long-term political direction inside institutions designed around stability and risk management. Add a “<a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2e12j4gz0o"">black hole</a>” in public finances and sporadic and often contradictory regulation, and it has rarely been harder for public servants to know what to decide — or, <em>critically</em>, how to make decisions in the first place.</p><p>Drawing on my work in early-stage policymaking at HMRC and research at UCL’s Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, this short piece of “writing as thinking” argues that the UK’s public institutions are structurally incapable of navigating uncertainty because they are built on a decision-making logic designed for predictability, control and linear planning — not for complexity, learning or adaptation. Because, if the UK is serious about missions, or<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/09/labour-promises-radical-shake-up-of-uk-civil-service""> radically</a> overhauling how the civil service thinks and works, the everyday practicalities of how decisions are framed, contested and made will need to change.</p><h3>The issue of managing uncertainty</h3><p>Across government and beyond, a lot of my work has been at the earliest stages of decision-making — where ideas are half-baked, assumptions untested, and uncertainty is at its highest. In these spaces, one of the things I see teams struggle with the most is the ability to be agile enough to experiment, learn and iterate while being stable enough to maintain direction and meet deadlines. In fact, as<a href=""https://substack.com/home/post/p-176398097?selection=9c71ba4a-9687-4262-8f6d-c025eca300e1#:~:text=The%20result%20is%20an%20innovation%20ecosystem%20that%20excels%20at%20designing%20frameworks%20but%20struggles%20to%20change%20itself""> Rainer Kattel</a> and<a href=""https://medium.com/@jamestplunkett/iterate-if-you-can-5f14b93a48cf""> James Plunkett</a> have noted, institutions are often <em>both</em> too stable and too agile — highly proficient at producing procedures and frameworks that promise control, yet poor at learning, experimenting, or re-orienting in the midst of uncertainty. The result is an all too familiar blend of paralysis, short-termism, and “<a href=""https://re-state.co.uk/publications/everythingism-an-essay/"">everythingism</a>”: needing to respond to everything while changing little.</p><p>This dynamic is not accidental. It is a lasting hangover from New Public Management — a model that has compartmentalised and hollowed out the civil service in order to make it measurable, auditable and controllable. Designed for an era of fewer citizens, slower information flows and limited data capacity, our civil service is oriented around prediction and control despite vast improvements in data, research and digital infrastructure. Put simply, we have left ourselves in a situation where we are taking 21st century challenges, evaluating them with 20th century tools, and responding within 19th century institutions built in a different time <em>and</em> for a different time.</p><p>In “Seeing Like a State”, James C Scott describes this as the state’s drive for “legibility” — making societies administratively visible by simplifying their complexity into categories that can be planned for. To illustrate this he uses the example of modern scientific forestry in Prussia. In an effort to maximise timber output, foresters cleared mixed woodlands and replanted them in perfectly straight rows of a single fast-growing species. The first generation produced higher yields, fantastic. But, by the second and third generations, yields collapsed. The drive for order — monoculture, straight lines, predictability — had unintentionally erased the complex, interdependent ecology that sustained the forest and made it viable in the first place.</p><p>New Public Management simply extends this logic into government, treating institutions as machines to be ordered rather than ecosystems to be stewarded. It rewards prediction over understanding and linear planning over iterative learning in what Funtowicz and Ravetz call a “<a href=""https://www.nusap.net/downloads/funtowiczandravetz1994.pdf"">doctrine reinforced by guesswork</a>,” reliant on cost–benefit analysis and other appraisal tools built for marginal change in predictable environments. These methods make little room for uncertainty or contested values because they flatten complexity, obscure causality and routinely miss the non-linear, cascading effects that dominate policymaking. The result is a higher<a href=""https://options2040.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/The-Radical-How.pdf""> risk of expensive failures</a>, often harming those most in need.</p><p>More fundamentally, this mode of public problem-solving is simply too slow and too distant from the people it is meant to help, offering little opportunity for learning or course correction in the first place. And, for policymaking — a forum directly concerned with people and their behaviour — it is simply not tenable to expect civil servants and ministers to predict, design and justify interventions up-front without addressing these structural constraints. Put as many<a href=""https://publicpolicydesign.blog.gov.uk/2023/02/09/what-does-policymaking-look-like/""> policy design cycles</a> in front as me as you would like, the “waterfall” model of policy delivery, illustrated in <a href=""https://public.digital/the-radical-how""><em>The Radical How</em></a>, makes this explicit. Planning happens early, implementation happens late, and evaluation tends to arrive long after the window for improvement has closed.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration depicting a waterfall policymaking process where decisions are made upfront when the least is known."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/984/0*owRgK1xqCP8gatf1.png"" /><figcaption>Waterfall policymaking — <a href=""https://public.digital/the-radical-how"">The Radical How</a></figcaption></figure><p>Recent literature on Human Learning Systems pushes this argument further, describing how this creates a “<a href=""https://www.humanlearning.systems/uploads/Public-service-for-the-new-world.pdf"">pathological culture of blame and defensiveness</a>,” within the civil service, where ambiguity is treated as error and risk is transferred onto individuals. Even when uncertainty is real and unavoidable, public officials are expected to present polished cases that imply certainty, rather than surface complexity or challenge assumptions — something I see time and time again within HMRC. What this ultimately means is that talented civil servants (of which I work with many) become trapped in an environment where they are punished for being wrong, rewarded for nothing going wrong, and rarely recognised when things go right.</p><p>This paralysis and culture of negativity isn’t individualised. I work with and have met so many talented, driven and imaginative civil servants. However, because the institutional grammar, design and hierarchy of decision-making treats uncertainty as a threat to be contained rather than a condition to be worked with, they are not given the time or space to do their best work. We have designed our organisations to reduce risk and cost under the premise of control but failed to appreciate how work actually gets done in complex systems — <a href=""https://paulcairney.wordpress.com/2025/11/06/why-dont-governments-learn-and-what-can-we-do-about-it/"">ultimately treating learning as political performance</a>.</p><blockquote><a href=""https://playingwithtime.substack.com/p/three-insights-from-a-week-of-conversations"">Recent reflections</a> from municipal leaders in China — long associated with rigid target-driven governance — note that obligatory numerical targets distort behaviour, narrow attention and create perverse incentives within institutions.</blockquote><p>Ultimately, this manifests as both a bias towards inaction and an inclination to make decisions when the least is known. Jen Pahlka memorably phrases this as “<a href=""https://www.notion.so/Unfit-for-uncertainty-Rethinking-decision-making-for-missions-2b003207924880de8466f3c32dd830ab?pvs=21"">policy vomit</a>” — in which the words of the policy are vomited, essentially undigested, into the administration of a policy, without the benefit of thoughtful, learning and iteration. In a department like HMRC, where impact is traditionally inseparable from cost, this often means using cost-benefit analysis (as suggested by the UK government’s guide to policy appraisal <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/the-green-book-and-accompanying-guidance-and-documents"">— the ‘Green Book’</a>) as a means to centre on the risk of doing something rather than the opportunity for it to go well — effectively excluding learning from the process altogether and overlooking or under-considering real-world dynamics.</p><h3>Towards managing missions or muddling through?</h3><p>Over the last decade, governments and policymakers have been increasingly turning to mission-oriented innovation as a way to break out of incrementalism and tackle the “wicked” problems causing so much trouble for our ways of working today. It signals a shift away from the narrow technocratic logic of correcting market failures towards a more ambitious role for the state in shaping and co-creating markets, mobilising collective action and directing investment towards clearly defined public purposes.</p><p>Labour’s<a href=""https://labour.org.uk/change/mission-driven-government/""> commitment to a mission-driven government</a>, not dissimilar to those across Europe as part of a broader “third generation” of innovation and policy frameworks, was meant to embody this shift — a break from short-term crisis management and a renewed focus on long-term ends. Essentially, a recognition that neoliberal and technocratic policy tools are fundamentally unsuited to steering complex socio-technical systems as they privilege efficiency, prediction and control over relevance, learning and adaptation.</p><p>There is plenty of<a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5348729""> noise on mission theory</a>. The problem, however, is that while there are many practical examples of a shift towards achieving mission policy — and more pragmatic, learning centric ways of policymaking — any meaningful practices generated by this new approach to policy have struggled to take hold.</p><p>Demos Helsinki’s “<a href=""https://demoshelsinki.fi/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Missions-for-Governance-Demos-Helsinki.pdf"">Missions for governance</a>” paper reports that a 2022 survey of more than 40 OECD countries found that only one in four mission initiatives had a clearly defined target; only 15% had a dedicated governance structure; and only one in ten had a plan for monitoring and evaluation. In other words, while governments are embracing the language of missions, they are implementing them through business-as-usual structures, inherited from New Public Management, rather than transforming the way we make decisions.</p><p>This is perhaps indicative of a larger problem of institutional change. While missions and many other forms of experimental governance look to give us a blueprint for reigniting innovation policy, they do not help shift the entrenched challenges that government faces internally. It makes me wonder — we’ve been practicing systems thinking, futures thinking and experimental forms of governance for decades (with missions as the new synthesis of some of these tools) yet regardless of how good they sound, they haven’t scaled or had the impact any of them promise because they have all failed to address these entrenched challenges (See an interesting expansion of this point <a href=""https://thesystemsthinker.com/why-few-organizations-adopt-systems-thinking/"">here</a>).</p><p>To me, this all suggests that regardless of the approach, the need for a reimagined architecture of our institutions has never been more important if we want missions to be actually transformative rather than symbolic. Missions cannot be delivered through a policymaking architecture optimised for certainty, marginal change and after-the-fact evaluation. They require a state capable of working with uncertainty rather than suppressing it — one that builds learning into the fabric of everyday decision-making, rather than treating it as an optional add-on.</p><h3>Reimagining public value must begin in the texture of everyday decisions.</h3><p>If missions are to mean anything, the civil service needs to rebuild its capacity to create public value as a practice. That requires a new grammar of decision-making: one that treats uncertainty as navigable, frames choices in terms of <em>risk and opportunity</em> rather than cost and control (See<a href=""https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/sites/bartlett/files/final_iipp_2021-03_roa_simon_sharpe_et_al_21_jan.pdf""> Simon Sharpe</a>), and builds learning into the routine choreography of how problems are defined and acted upon.</p><p>This shift depends on everyday practices, not high-level strategies: developing shared strategic alignment; negotiating problem definitions with those affected; testing ideas early; iterating in public; and learning at portfolio scale rather than programme-by-programme. These are the capabilities that make missions possible — and without them, missions will remain symbolic rather than transformative.

<h4><em>We are in a transitional period: from the era of software shaped like household objects to the era of software shaped like thought.</em></h4><p>We have a big choice to make: we’re about to jump into a new <em>era </em>of technology — meaning different values, expectations and powers — and we need to choose what it looks like.*1 The transition itself is unavoidable, but the details are up to us. Today we must chose between a. a future where our software environment has a thought-shaped interface on top of all the old kludge, or b. a future where software is built from the ground up to represent our thoughts, not twist or control them.</p><figure><img alt=""Neurons, viewed with a microscope and stained in bright green, connecting to each other."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aGaZun9-bzKxCNydXA5ZoA.png"" /><figcaption>Neurons: incidentally, they are richly and freely connected, not unlike our thinking, which they power.</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s how I plot our society’s timeline when it comes to computers:</p><ol><li><strong>Computer-shaped (1941-1979): </strong>The first way we communicated with modern, digital computers was entirely on their terms</li><li><strong>Thing-shaped (1979–2026): </strong>Then we interacted with computers through imagined household objects (e.g. documents, clipboards, desktops)</li><li><strong>Thought-shaped (2026–): </strong>In the future, computer interfaces will be shaped like human thought</li></ol><p>This dam has to break. It happens that AI is doing a lot the breaking: LLMs’ natural language interface is the first of a set of thought-shaped technologies to come into common use. Indeed, we need to make sure that we don’t end up with a “same circus, different clowns” story, with a thin layer of natural language (AI/LLMs) on top of the same old exploitation and insult we’re used to from technology.</p><p>During times of transition like this, we (the users, people who care but are told to shut up) have the opportunity to take things not usually subject to change — systems, norms, standards — and make them better. I think that our computer interfaces (operating systems, applications, user interfaces) are inhumane, and today we have the opportunity to demand humanity.</p><p>I invite you to take a trip with me through the previous eras of technology. Then we can think together about what the new era might look like. Let me explain how we should navigate, before we begin.</p><h3>Navigation</h3><p>There are two things to consider when navigating among these eras:</p><h4>1. Invisibility</h4><p>It might not be immediately and intuitively clear why I make a judgement about, say, the shape of a user interface. To many, even most, the nature of modern computer interfaces is just <em>how they are. </em>I’m here to say that modern computer interfaces are <em>peculiar </em>— just as your regional accent sounds to your fellow citizens, while to you it sounds <em>normal.</em></p><p>Computer interfaces are imaginary, meaning that it’s not always obvious when they are <em>wrong</em>. Unlike a broken limb or a mountain floating in the sky, it’s hard to say that something is wrong when there’s little or nothing to which one can point and say “<em>this</em> is right.”</p><h4>2. Why are we about to enter a new era?</h4><p>Why is technology progressing like this, and why this transition? In my view, technology closer to the shape of human thought is more powerful and enjoyable to use — our desires will pull technology and interfaces in this direction.</p><p>Meanwhile, LLMs with chat-style interfaces are getting very popular. These interfaces are pushing things forward because they are thought-shaped, and seem to be helping people to demand more straightforward and approachable interfaces.</p><p>Our technology is of course held back by those with an interest in keeping things as they are, usually because:</p><ul><li>They sell things that work in the old way</li><li>They control a department that does things in the old way</li><li>They can’t get their head round the new way</li></ul><p>Be vigilant, finally, for fake or dubious progress. For instance, the smartphone boom starting in the mid-noughties gave people something more accessible, but under excessive control by supercorporations. Progress is not a single line, it’s a delta.</p><h4>Ted Nelson</h4><p>Finally, I beseech you to watch and read anything you possibly can by Ted Nelson. More or less everything he predicted has come true, and where technology deviated from his recommendations it is thus weaker. His Ted talk — 1990! — is a great place to start:</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/6bc8bc7e01a04dafce0f8fb7f47086cb/href"">https://medium.com/media/6bc8bc7e01a04dafce0f8fb7f47086cb/href</a><p>So, to the timeline:</p><h3>The computer-shaped era</h3><p>1941–1979</p><p>Defining machine: IBM 360</p><figure><img alt=""The front panel of an IBM 360 mainframe computer."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-bsp32jp41jfeU37C6Thpg.jpeg"" /></figure><p>This era is characterized by the fact that, to work with a computer, you needed to do so on the computers terms — with little deviation. If you look at a mainframe or minicomputer, manufactured before the year 2000, it will likely have a lot of switches on the front panel.</p><p>Some of these switches allow you to enter bits directly into the computer’s memory. Each switch controlled a single bit in a given byte, and you flipped the switch up to set the bit as 1 and down for 0.</p><figure><img alt=""The front panel of an IBM 360 mainframe computer, zoomed to show a rank of switches used to set bits in the machine’s memory."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_u20wgrHpO8KpdWJL_qx_g.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Editing bits in a byte has little to do with whatever task (like writing or mathematics) you have mind and everything to do with changing the value of bits: a computer’s reason for being. Front panels like this, along with punch cards, and paper and glass terminals, and more, are all examples of computer-shaped interfaces.</p><p>The defining user interface convention of this era was the IBM System 360: a colossal, expensive mainframe system. People ran applications on the 360, but users usually created these themselves. IBM offered several operating systems, but nothing recognizable to a modern user.</p><p>This created a caste of computer professionals to do the work, who naturally adopted a rarefied mindset. These people, having to descend to the level of bits, often never surfaced — or when they did they involved much of the computer’s rigid, sequential way of being into their own.</p><p>Ted Nelson called this “punch card brain.” The mindset is alive today, such as those who act as though one is calling for personal nuclear weapons or the abolition of the British monarchy when we inquire politely about being a little less hierarchical in how we organize data.</p><figure><img alt=""A person sitting at work on a terminal."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hoNVkchvSJPPRm_y-3BPgg.jpeg"" /></figure><p>This era was venerable, however, in that it avoided a few pretenses common today: there was no pretend “document” slapped over the underlying data. Back then, what you got is what you get.</p><p>All in all, this era made us think of the computer as big, difficult, and separate. It made repetitive, sequential tasks faster. With nuanced, interleaved thinking, it helped little or not at all.</p><h3>The thing-shaped era</h3><p><strong>1979–2026</strong></p><p>Defining machine: Macintosh</p><figure><img alt=""The Macintosh computer, consisting of an integrated computer and screen, a keyboard and mouse."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bNPdcyT639HVeYZ1i5KCGg.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Next came the era of computing in which we worked with computers through digital versions of common office or household objects. For instance the document, clipboard, desktop, file, folder, etc.</p><p>This is in part an apology — for the alienation of the last era — and condescension, in that they went so far as to believe that non-computer people couldn’t understand information and system concepts in themselves, but needed a metaphor to connect it an object in their home or office.</p><p>“See that thing on the screen? [a word processor] It’s like a piece of a paper in the computer.”</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot from MacWrite, which is designed to look like a computer."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/328/1*yxN1xfHlzGM4lst55m7Ihg.png"" /><figcaption>MacWrite, an early word processor, made to look like paper.</figcaption></figure><p>The nature of what runs on machines in this era is indeed that of a figleaf and/or a red herring: often colorful, sometimes in motion or noisy, often with fake personhood (see Clippy). Most of what we touch every day: separate applications with incompatible data, warring operating systems, “windows” feel like what the computer actually <em>is </em>but are at best an annoying expedient and at worst a cynical trap.</p><h4>We didn’t need these metaphors as much as they said we did</h4><p>Firstly, this attitude is wrong in itself: most people with jobs must understand and organize numerous formal systems. Of the top of my head:</p><ol><li>Knitters must read, understand and realize knitting patterns.</li><li>Store clerks must enter data purchase information and mange inventory.</li><li>Musicians must manage time, pitch and ensemble; in the case of Jazz and improvised genres, they must do so on the fly.</li></ol><p>The popular media present computers and their central processing units (CPUs) to us as unfathomably complex. But consider this: a computer is at base doing nothing more than turning on and off a certain set of circuits over time.</p><p>A knitter does just the same, working from a knitting pattern that tells them which type of stitch they should do, in a sequence. Some of you will know already that the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card"">modern punch card was first used</a> for weaving machines, developed later into a general data medium.</p><p>Inconsiderate techies look at a knitter, clerk or musician and say “those fluffies can’t understand computers,” when those fluffies work within the same formal system every day. As with many other subjects — particularly mathematics — I think that much of our fear of computers comes not from their nature, but from how they’re presented.</p><h4>Metaphor hangover</h4><p>Secondly, these “metaphors” tend to stick around and cause trouble. Consider this: maybe there is someone — not quite grasping the function of a word processor on a computer — who would benefit from me saying, “it’s a bit like a paper document, on the computer.”</p><p>But this metaphor sticks to the digital simulacrum: we act as though digital documents are bound by the limitations of paper documents. For instance digital documents and their parts can in theory be freely intermixed and reused, but there are practically no good digital tools for this purpose.</p><p>More brutally, we reify one of the most crushing limitations of documents: pages. Put it this way, if you had a document (this one, for instance) would you say to yourself, “this would be better if the system I use to read it simulated it being split over some number of pages.” Indeed, if you were of that opinion, this feature should obviously be optional — and be off by default.</p><p>This is why I try to avoid the word “document” altogether. I don’t think there’s anything lost by referring instead to particular sets of smaller structures (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that refer to meaningful literary ideas and that can be freely recombined into any number of “works” that we show to others.</p><p>Let’s say that I write an article: is it a document? Yes. But what if I then make it instead a section within a larger article: is it still a document, or is it nullified by the larger form? These are not serious questions: they’re distractions that come up because we’re thinking about the problem in the wrong way.</p><p>In my view, any arrangements of text (combinations, subsets, etc. regardless of what came first) are equally valid (though not necessarily equally interesting). We need a new word (perhaps “work”) to replace “document” in referring to a particular thing we want to show to someone else.</p><p>Computers are indeed our best chance of building information systems shaped like our thoughts. Our thoughts — which we can associate freely, combining any one thought with any others or parts thereof, creating connections in any shape — have never fit into human information systems, which insist material must be linear, tabular or hierarchical.</p><p>But we threw away this chance for a generation by simulating paper and other household objects. The next era will give us another chance.</p><h3>The thought-shaped era</h3><p>2026–</p><p>Defining machine: to be determined</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot from Coeus, showing a an article by Ted Nelson on the right and an article by me on the left, with an article from Nelson’s article reused in mine.

But you might be asking: how is thought <em>shaped</em>, then?</p><p>Thoughts, or more generally ideas, have abstract shapes in the same way that physical objects do. For instance, the following ideas are tree shaped:</p><ol><li>The evolutionary “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life_(biology)"">tree of life</a>” (after a certain point)</li><li>Organizational hierarchy</li><li>Many computer programs</li></ol><figure><img alt=""A corporate “org” or organizational chart, showing a tree of departments and managers, with one department reporting only to one department above it, and with any number of departments reporting to it."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*A2__sNyut5-gP2Jbnp0ycQ.jpeg"" /></figure><p>If we accept this, we realize also that:</p><ol><li>Thoughts can be any shape</li><li>If a shape is unfamiliar to us, the thought will be hard for us to grasp</li><li>Likewise, things come naturally when we have their shape in our minds</li><li>And we learn new shapes over time</li></ol><p>Disconcertingly, people can sometimes forget about certain shapes or come to reject them: corporate types sometimes, for instance, are troubled by network graphs and insist everything should be hierarchical. Oddly, otherwise flexible systems like Unix enforce hierarchy of the filesystem: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Files-11"">this is unnecessary</a>, but you get so used to it that when someone poses the idea of doing something different, it feels<em> wrong.</em></p><figure><img alt=""A diagram of a file structure that one could create in DEC’s Files11 filesystem, in which one file is in two directories, which is not possible in most filesystems today."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*cM3m8Uk0TSSc7w364aXrlg.png"" /><figcaption>A diagram of a file structure that one could create in DEC’s Files11 filesystem, in which one file is in two directories, which is not possible in most filesystems today.</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed, the hierarchical Unix filesystem is problematic because it precludes many valid ways of thinking about information — it is, thus, not thought shaped.</p><h4>Why does this matter?</h4><p>It hurts us when our interfaces are not shaped like our thoughts because you can only control a system (say a piece of airspace around an airport) if the following are true:</p><ol><li>Your control system contains a model of the system you want to control, such as an air traffic control map.</li><li>The model has a part for every aspect of your system that you care about, your map needs a model plane (today digital) for every real plane in your airspace.</li></ol><p>Just as an air traffic controller denied a map or enough detail to track every plane is sure to fail — I say that if your work is dotted with abandoned, disorganized or twisted writing projects, there’s nothing necessarily wrong with you or your ideas, only with your software.</p><figure><img alt=""An air traffic control software system, with boxes for several flights that a given controller is managing.

Here I defer to Kant, who said that there are three modes of thinking, allowing us to:</p><ul><li>Separate ideas from anything irrelevant (abstraction)</li><li>Combine several ideas into a new idea (combination)</li><li>Set several ideas side by side and look at them together (relation)</li></ul><p>We can use these principles as a system to build idealized forms of either general structures (e.g. a tree) or particular structures (e.g. my network of friends).

Read more about this in <a href=""https://olivermeredithcox.medium.com/the-cybernetic-word-processor-20537de5c482"">my article on the subject</a>. Here are some important aspects of the design:</p><ol><li>Every consistent idea of literature exists in COEUS. When something is thought-shaped, it needs to have a feature/function for every concept in the human system that it’s modeling. A word processor models literature, but no word processor models aspects of language like sentences, clauses, and words (and their components). COEUS does: every sentence, say, is uniquely identified, can be moved around and referenced as a unit.</li><li>COEUS can do relationships. For instance, I can think about the relationship between a given paragraph in one article and a word in another: the closest thing we have to modeling this in modern word processors/Web editors is what we term euphemistically a “hyperlink,” but which is innately flawed in that it is not visible when you’re looking at the thing it points to. COEUS’ links are visible from every endpoint they connect, and are visualized as lines on screen.</li><li>“big picture”COEUS lets you <em>point </em>to anything you like and retrieve anything you like. As mentioned in point 1, everything that is real in literature is real in COEUS: this means that I can link to a single sentence in an article (not just the whole article). For that matter, if I want to edit a single paragraph or heading from a book, with COEUS I can open and work with that, just that, and nothing else.</li></ol><figure><img alt=""A screenshot from COEUS, showing visibly linked pieces of text (solid lines), as well as the same text reused in two different places (hatched lines)."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*I-I6vs8b8KJoTUgSW0h7ZQ.png"" /><figcaption>A screenshot from COEUS, showing visibly linked pieces of text (solid lines), as well as the same text reused in two different places (hatched lines). I’m told our UI is gnarly: we hear you. At HSM, first we make things work, then we make them fast, then we make them beautiful — so, we’re working on it.</figcaption></figure><h3>Two paths: more alienation, or liberation at last from the restrictions in media that held back our thinking</h3><p>AI and its purveyors come to you with a false prospectus. They claim to bring clarity, organizing information and explaining it in your own language. In fact, they are a jolly coat of paint on top of a rotting structure, which will further decay with our eyes averted and focused on the AI sitting on top.</p><p>AI does nothing to help:</p><ol><li>Our systems<em> actually</em> work together.</li><li>Us <em>actually</em> to own/control our data and information, rather than having supercorporations do so.</li><li>Us make our software more capable of <em>actually</em> expressing important human information rather than what comes easily to computers (tables and hierarchies).</li></ol><p>We need, urgently, to build a better future. We must avoid the same sort of sleight of hand that gave us the thing-shaped era: we needed systems that allow us to express our ideas and expand our intellects; this means systems capable of expressing any idea, richly interlinking material, collaborating, versioning and reusing our writing.</p><p>What did they give us? Fonts, flashing lights, and print-preview.</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of the CNN homepage."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YtgjBi4bIs1jE2MrVcUiaA.png"" /></figure><p>This is all to say — leaning on <em>Back to the Future </em>— that we the users have the power to choose which timeline we go down: the good timeline, or the Biff timeline. The decisions we make now will determine how we think about information and by extension how we experience reality.</p><p>Of course, when you start this sort of talk, people say:</p><ul><li>“Users don’t care about that, they just want things to be easy.”</li><li>“That’s too different from what they’re used to!”</li><li>“Be realistic.”</li></ul><p>But people before me have proved this perspective wrong again and again:</p><ul><li>They said all computers should be colossal and expensive like IBM’s, DEC proved them wrong by making computers for a few thousand dollars.</li><li>They said computers were the domain only of extremely technical people, and Apple proved them wrong by creating the Mac.</li><li>They said all operating systems should be closed and proprietary like Microsoft, and Linus Torvalds proved them wrong by creating Linux.</li></ul><p>Today, they’re saying that users want a drip of AI slop, powered by a too-big-to-fail data system to horrible to face up to. I invite you, dear user, to join with me and prove them wrong.</p><p>We invite you to<a href=""https://form.jotform.com/253228033234044""> fill in our survey</a> to help us find out more about what you need from your software.</p><ul><li>1 Some provisos on this sort of thinking: 1. All eras are named by people, some are named better — more aligned with a related change in a preponderance of events; 2. Era-oriented thinking seems to be a trap for messianic and conspiratorial beliefs; 3. I speak of eras above only to make vivid important change in something I care about: ideas.</li><li>2 For instance, we can think about the interaction between two balls colliding; there provably is some sense in which the two balls held together are one object but it is fleeting and tenuous compared to the reality of the individual balls.</li><li>3 I use examples here because I haven’t found a way to distinguish relation and combination: for instance, what does it mean to combine two paragraphs to make a larger section of text other than “setting them by one another, so as to take a view of them at once” which is precisely how Kant described <em>relation</em>; Kant clarifies that this happens “without uniting them into one,” and I’m not sure what this means. Specifically, if I set two things together, they are necessarily united into one larger thing; this is especially true in the case of links in my system, HSM, which are uniquely identified, persistent, first class objects, which literally unite however many other things they link (text, media, other links) into one new thing. I would go further than Kant, therefore, and say that the difference between combination and relation is more a question of <em>feel</em>: but is no less valid, nonetheless.</li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=108313ff4401"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/we-are-entering-the-era-of-thought-shaped-software-108313ff4401"">We are entering the era of thought-shaped software</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Weekly curated resources for designers — thinkers and makers.</h4><figure><a href=""https://www.doc.cc/syntax/critique""><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*IW6ZtFT5cT5vBQV3.png"" /></a></figure><p>“A critique is not a governance mechanism, nor is it a group brainstorming session. It’s a necessary collision. It’s the intentional application of adversarial thought to something that isn’t finished yet. Its sole purpose is to pressure-test the underlying assumptions. Ultimately, critiques are about injecting constructive doubt into a designer’s premature certainty before they build too much or go too far.”</p><p><a href=""https://www.doc.cc/syntax/critique""><strong>Critique: on elevating craft through critical thinking</strong></a><strong> →</strong></p><h3>Editor picks</h3><ul><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/human-engineering-65e59d9ac6d8""><strong>Human engineering</strong></a><strong> →</strong><br />Doing the right thing should be easy.<br />By <a href=""https://medium.com/u/ba0eec3bbe0b"">Michael Parent</a></li><li><a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/the-value-of-design-in-a-product-organisation-850661d1b22f""><strong>Is there such thing as Product Design?</strong></a><strong> →</strong><br />The value of Design in a product organization.<br />By <a href=""https://medium.com/u/44c1b36a36ce"">danramsden</a></li><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/mandated-screen-addiction-undemocratic-design-799e1d0144ce?sk=40855db0c99ae23869c21baf7f9d0726""><strong>Mandated screen addiction = undemocratic design</strong></a><strong> →</strong><br />There is a contradiction in digitalization.<br />By <a href=""https://medium.com/u/2f6d8b4507fe"">Sanna Rau</a></li></ul><p><em>The UX Collective is an independent design publication that elevates unheard design voices and helps designers think more critically about their work.</em></p><figure><a href=""https://colorpalette.pro/?ref=sidebar&amp;color=rgb%280%25+80%25+100%25%29&amp;paletteType=ana&amp;paletteStyle=square&amp;colorFormat=oklch&amp;effects=0%2C0%2C0%2C0""><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*KK6uOXcIZBgWYdZi.png"" /></a></figure><p><a href=""https://colorpalette.pro/?ref=sidebar&amp;color=rgb%280%25+80%25+100%25%29&amp;paletteType=ana&amp;paletteStyle=square&amp;colorFormat=oklch&amp;effects=0%2C0%2C0%2C0""><strong>Color palette pro: customizable palettes in advanced color spaces</strong></a><strong> →</strong></p><h3>Make me think</h3><ul><li><a href=""https://philippdubach.com/2025/11/23/is-ai-really-eating-the-world/?ref=sidebar""><strong>Is AI really eating the world?</strong></a><strong> →</strong><br />“Generative AI appears to be the next platform shift, or it could break the cycle entirely. The range of outcomes spans from “just more software” to a single unified intelligence that handles everything.

They run in parallel, supposedly toward the same product, but they rarely sit at the same spot. Design debt on one side, tech debt on the other, shifting priorities somewhere ahead, and the occasional giant ‘wait what are we building again?’ boulder in the middle.”</li><li><a href=""https://hazelweakly.me/blog/to-be-a-leader-of-systems/?ref=sidebar""><strong>To be a leader of systems</strong></a><strong> →</strong><br />“Firstly, you need to hold in your head the knowledge that you will probably–no, almost certainly–fail.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946768.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>There are several reasons why finding the right dry shampoo is a tricky feat. For starters, it’s not guaranteed that it will actually help your hair feel cleaner and absorb excess oil — and that’s not even taking into consideration whether or not it’ll leave a chalky cast in its wake. And if there’s one person who feels uniquely primed to put the stuff through its paces, it’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/chloe-kim-snowboarder-mental-health-interview"">Chloe Kim</a>.</p>



<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/chloe-kim-interview-olympics-identity-laneige"">Olympic snowboarder</a> — who the world met in the 2018 Winter Games as a bleached blonde — has recently returned to her brunette roots. Given that her job requires more time in a snug, sweat-trapping helmet than the average person, when she says she swears by Batiste to keep her roots feeling and looking fresh, I — a fellow dark brunette — am inclined to believe her.</p>



<p>“I remember using Batiste for the first time and being like, <em>oh my gosh, this works</em>,” she tells Refinery29, days before going to intensive training ahead of the upcoming 2026 Olympics in Italy. “Especially with my travel and training, it’s one of those necessities that I need on the go.” Her favorite formula? The <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/zen-matcha-light-dry-shampoo-pimprod2049243?sku=2633384"">Zen Matcha Light Dry Shampoo</a>, which uses rice starch to mop up excess oil and has a refreshing chamomile, green tea, and sandalwood scent.</p>



<p>Keep reading as Kim divulges her Olympics hair routine, the K-beauty find she’s currently obsessed with, and more.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>On her favorite skincare of the moment </h2>



<p>“My skincare routine these days consists of Medicube,” Kim tells me — and it makes total sense considering the brand’s toner pads have become a cult staple among K-beauty obsessives and R29 staffers alike. “I love their toner pads and face masks, especially the collagen masks,” adds Kim.  For her, that reliability becomes essential when she’s travelling: “When I’m on the road, especially for snowboarding, where I’m in very dry climates, it’s all about moisturize, moisturize, moisturize.” We love <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/collagen-niacinamide-jelly-cream-pimprod2053650?sku=2645369"">Medicube’s Collagen Niacinamide Jelly Cream</a> for its glass skin-bestowing ingredients like collagen, squalane, and niacinamide.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>On returning to her brunette roots</h2>



<p>While Kim might be known for her incredible hair today, the journey getting there wasn’t exactly smooth sailing. “Bleaching was rough for my hair, I’m not going to lie. I had to chop it when it was bleached, which was sad, but when I went back to brunette, I was able to grow it out, and I started caring more about my hair when I saw that it was growing back very healthy.” Kim says that it’s about having a consistent routine, but mainly, taking care of your scalp. “My scalp was always so oily and congested, and I would wash it all the time. And then that’s when I discovered Batiste dry shampoo,” she says. The <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/zen-matcha-light-dry-shampoo-pimprod2049243?sku=2633384"">Zen Matcha Light Dry Shampoo</a> buys you more time between washes — ideal if you’re as busy as Kim — thanks to oil-absorbing rice starch. It’s also packed with moisturizing glycerin and calming plant extracts to keep your scalp healthy and comfortable.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>On her Olympics hair routine</h2>



<p>Kim’s secret to excellent hair is practice — and then some. “Honestly, it’s like muscle memory at this point. I just know where to pull from,” she says of her accidentally perfect strands. “I will say when I sleep with heatless curls in, I get a really cute wave. So when I pull my strands out, they’re perfect.” To make the most of your beauty sleep, try <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/satin-heatless-curling-set-pimprod2031918?sku=2592934"">Kitsch’s Satin Heatless Curling Set</a>, which cuts down on frizz and breakage while delivering bouncy, defined ringlets.</p>



<p>Kim laughs as she thinks back to her early snowboarding days, when bigger always felt better. “I used to like [my waves] really thick,” she adds, “so I’d pull out a pretty big chunk, but then it started obstructing my vision when I was doing tricks, so I had to tone it back a bit.”</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>On her experimenting with beauty</h2>



<p>Looking back on her beauty routine throughout the years, Kim — whose signature look is a matte nude lip and feathered brows — says she’s switched things up so many times. “I got into makeup when I was young, and then hair came shortly after. I wanted to dye it all these crazy colors and do all of that fun stuff — I’m all about it. When I first started doing makeup, I always had to have eyeliner, usually a little wing. I also loved mascara and got into BB cushions too.” (One of her go-to’s is the <a href=""https://global.oliveyoung.com/product/detail?prdtNo=GA230518794"">Laneige Neo Cushion</a>, which packs hydrating properties and sheer coverage in a light-as-air formula].</p>

<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/december-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">December opens</a> a prophetic window for us. It is a transitional pause and an opportunity to integrate all the lessons we’ve gathered throughout the year and lock it in before moving onto the new year portal. Here we get to rest, recalibrate our energies, and focus on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-zodiac-sign-2025"">setting intentions</a> for the new year. It is a moment between endings and beginnings, and if we are silent enough, we can hear Spirit’s whispers on what’s next. <br /><br />This month’s tarotscopes reveal the frequency you’ll be walking into in 2026: the blessings you’ve earned, the lessons that are wrapping up, and the energy that will define your next chapter. You are always the energetic architect of your present and future. Now allow these tarotscopes to guide you toward alignment. <figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946629.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Capricorn: 3 of Pentacles <br /></h2></strong><br />It’s time to level up your foundation and your standard in every area of your life. If 2025 has taught you anything, it’s that you deserve it all, but you have to embody it and start making choices that reflect that reality. Review your foundations in all areas of your life: spirituality, health, relationships, finances, career, beauty, and more. Evaluate what worked versus what didn’t, and what is the next level for you in these areas of your life. You’re no stranger to effective work and dedication. Everything that you’ve been applying yourself in 2025 will blossom in 2026. The 3 of Pentacles reminds you that collaboration is your currency, so don’t hesitate to ask for help or resources. You don’t have to do a whole rehaul of your life alone. Let Source do the heavy lifting for you and bring you the right people, places, and opportunities. Let your excellence be seen. This is your year to master your craft and be rewarded for it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946624.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Aquarius: 2 of Wands<br /></h2></strong><br />This is your year to push your limits in terms of being seen and allowing your brilliance and genius to shine. The coming year will encourage you to expand in every area of your life; you must be fearless and confident with your momentum. In 2026, you will find yourself in new territory that requires a more regulated nervous system. You are worthy and capable of having and maintaining all of your desires. Nothing you encounter will be familiar, but it will be elevated. Your task is to not fall back into old patterns. Instead, decide and commit that you will raise your vibration as the new standard. It is time to move differently because you’ve outgrown so much in your life and you’re now ready for what you deserve. The world is literally opening up for you, and now is the time that you take advantage of all the inner work and effort you’ve done. It is all up to you. You get to choose your path and adventure.  </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946633.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Pisces: 3 of Swords</h2></strong><strong><br /></strong>The new year requires that you continue to release and cleanse from inside out. It is the karmic release that brings sweet blessings and makes space for the life you truly deserve to live, but it cannot pour in if you are subconsciously or even consciously still holding on to energies that you’ve inherited ancestrally or baggage that weighs you down. What is being cleared from your life will free you to focus on your purpose and projects that have been brought to your attention. This is purification, not punishment. Cut emotional cords and ties to old stories, people, places, past lives, habits, and even obligations that you’ve outgrown. Update your life with immense clarity. You know what you don’t want, and this can help give you insight on what you do. Focus on that and fine-tune the details on what that looks and feels like in every area. Don’t bind yourself to things that no longer bring pleasure or require labor in a way that doesn’t expand you. Update the way you do things and the way you frame your life. You must live your truth by all means necessary.  </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946627.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Aries: King of Swords<br /></h2></strong><br />This is the year of implementing a great strategy and upgrading your education and knowledge. Investing in yourself will be key to your growth and success. This coming year calls for clarity, precision, and mastery over your mind. Your words will carry profound weight, so this is the time to speak things into existence or create a journal practice where you can script things into existence or release emotions through the process. If you’ve failed to advocate for yourself, you will be bolder, sharper, more direct, clearer, and confident when negotiating in all areas of your life and discerning what you truly deserve versus what is being presented to you. Do not settle. Honesty is key this year. It’s best to stick to what you have decided to commit to and not stray off the path. In 2026, you will not be reactive but responding from your power and ability to see into the future. Refine your voice and leadership abilities. Trust that you know what is best for you, and the world will follow your direction. Leave the ego behind and leverage your superpowers. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946636.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Taurus: Queen of Wands<br /></h2></strong><br />This is a year of radical independence, sexual energy, and potent power. The Queen of Wands is your reminder that confidence <em>is</em> a currency and the more you flaunt it, the more your desires will gravitate to you. This is an unstoppable time when your spirit is finally aligned with an elevated identity. There’s nothing that you cannot have, be, or do. Your magnetism and charm require that you delegate and make your life simple, so that the “work” you do is more easeful and impactful. Stop playing small with your gifts and allow your free spirit to lead. You no longer need permission to be the fullest version of yourself. In this timeline, you are safe and abundant — trust that. Expect radical expansion in your business or career, finances, sex life, confidence, spiritual journey, and femininity. You will inspire many others to take up space.  </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946630.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Gemini: Page of Swords<br /></h2></strong><br />This is the year you invoke more curiosity and play. You will be reinventing yourself in ways that will shock others. Your ingenuity and ability to not only adapt to the time but shift it for the better is memorable and will forever change your life. You are not here to follow. Instead, you are here to lead and be an example for so many that want to break free from their limitations but need “permission” to do so. Your ability to flip the script and explore what now suits you versus what no longer applies will create a new identity for you that generates more wisdom and abundance and expands on your legacy. You are invited to stay teachable, lead with intellect and discernment, and use your innate spiritual technology that lives within you to reinvent ways of living that are efficient and needed. Great expansion lies in entrepreneurship and possibly the writing industry. Fresh ideas will come fast, so capture them before they fade. Just be mindful not to overthink. Learn as you go. Spirit’s saying: Your voice is evolving, so let it. What you study, share, and speak this year becomes the foundation of a new identity.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946628.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Cancer: 9 of Pentacles<br /></h2></strong><br />Cancer, 2026 is your soft life era, fully earned and fully embodied. The 9 of Pentacles confirms that your discipline and devotion are paying off. You can finally rest and let things come to you energetically rather than working toward a greater legacy. Everything you’ve built and worked on will manifest tenfold this year, so prepare to be in total overflow. This is the time to invest in upleveling your beauty, inner confidence, and luxury overall. Invest in yourself by pouring into you in ways that you were hesitant before. The luxury you will claim is rooted in self-worth, not validation from others. Your connection to the Divine is so unshakable that you have no doubt where your Source lies. Everything you touch will bloom. There is no limit to your magic and expansion.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946631.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Leo: 8 of Cups<br /></h2></strong><br />Leo, 2026 is your walk-away year, a period where you continuously choose yourself until that energy is locked into your DNA and you act from a space of Royal Sovereignty and opulence. This means that you are in a continual space of releasing not only that which you’ve outgrown but also what no longer resonates with you. You’ve found the secret of rapid quantum leaping, and it will seem like you’re jumping from one timeline to the next. This constant leap of transition marks that you are expanding your soul and are increasing your capacity to have more in every area of your life. The theme of 2026 is do not settle. You will have it all and more, and then you’ll realize that you deserve even more than what you initially thought. Flow with the momentum your inner Source and GPS is leading you on. You are not in perpetual cleansing and releasing but rather in perpetual becoming. You are no longer loyal and committed to things you did not choose for yourself. You are no longer holding space for energies and patterns you’ve inherited but have had no say on. Drop the struggle and the load. The journey ahead is about becoming light and sustaining it. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946637.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Virgo: Judgement<br /></h2></strong><br />Your spiritual glow up and understanding of where your own inner Source is leading you to are undeniable. You have no choice but to step ahead, regardless of your own irrational fears. Your higher calling is presenting itself to you and it is divine time that you answered. The Judgement card marks a rebirth: You’re shedding old versions of yourself, stepping into full purpose, and hearing Spirit loud and clear, as a lifestyle. Everything that felt confusing in 2025 suddenly aligns, and the rewards come through because you’re ready to live in truth and not illusion. Your ancestors are calling you into greater service in so many ways, to lead, to heal, to teach, and to transmit your wisdom. You will not have the space to second-guess yourself, and you won’t even think of it because your connection to Source will be so undeniable that you will let Source take the wheel and do the heavy lifting. This is your awakening year, and the miracles will overflow. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946632.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Libra: Queen of Cups<br /></h2></strong><br />This is the year when you soften further and rest in your divine feminine energy. It is a year of ease, peace, comfort, and radical self-trust. The Queen of Cups invites emotional mastery, not through control but rather through surrender. You will have the resources to process any emotion skillfully and also activate your psychic and intuitive gifts on a new level. This is a non-negotiable. You’re learning that sensitivity is strength and that your intuition is your most reliable currency. Allow it to speak to you in ways it hasn’t before and use it more actively. This year, your healing, creativity, and compassion become magnetic forces that open new doors in love and purpose. Spirit’s asking you to pour from a full cup, not a fractured one. Where you once overgave, that stream is now closed for your own use. Spirit will be speaking to you loudly, and the more you indulge in your own sweetness and softness, the more things will flow in your favor. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946635.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Scorpio: The Emperor  <br /></h2></strong><br />Scorpio, 2026 is all about embodying authority and creating the systems, routines, and discipline that will take you to the next level. The Emperor shows that you’re no longer playing with your potential; you are utilizing your masculine energy to build a structure that is the epitome of long-lasting wealth. It is a year when every area of your life is about to massively expand, but this comes with you enforcing strong boundaries and getting very clear on what it is you want. You won’t have time to entertain anything that isn’t for you or is underneath you. Own your power and claim the spotlight. You will have to become the leader that you’re seeking. There is no blueprint for your life; you are creating it along the way. Manifest your empire through organization and clarity. You’ve done enough dreaming.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946634.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Sagittarius: 5 of Swords<br /></h2></strong><br />Sagittarius, 2026 will pull you into radical honesty and will reveal all of your energetic leakages — or rather where you are being drained energetically in all areas of your life. Prepare to rid yourself of people, ways of being, and potential trajectories you thought you’d be on, and embark the journey of uncertainty. This year asks that you allow Spirit to take the wheel and provide the next steps and resources for you. This requires that you surrender and have faith in the journey unfolding. Don’t battle yourself. Preserve your energy for things that enhance and excite it. Playing small, over-explaining yourself, entertaining energetic vampires, and engaging in drama will no longer play a vital role in your life. You are clearing out old wounds and acting from a space of deliberate intention. Peace over everything — that’s how your blessings unfold. </figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

On Wednesday evening (05.11.2025), the largest full moon of the year can be seen over Germany – a so-called supermoon. According to the Association of Astronomers (VDS), the moon will then appear particularly large because it will only be around 356,400 kilometers away from the Earth at 11.16 pm. At other times, the moon is more than 400,000 kilometers away from the Earth. Photo: Patrick Pleul/dpa (Photo by Patrick Pleul/picture alliance via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As we come nearer to closing out 2025, the Cold Moon in Gemini on December 4th serves up some positivity for us all in the midst <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Sagittarius season</a> — putting us in an excellent mindset. In short: It is the vibe shift we’ve been waiting for. </p>



<p>This is the second-to-last <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/super-beaver-full-moon-in-taurus-horoscope-november-2025-meaning-effects"">supermoon in the series</a>; the next one occurs on January 3rd 2026. A supermoon occurs when the moon is in proximity to the earth in parity. When this happens, we feel the effects of illumination more deeply and intensely as the moon appears to be fuller, brighter, and shinier.</p>



<p>The last Full Moon of 2025 is asking us to make crucial decisions before New Year. We are torn between two different directions, offering us the chance to evolve or stay the same. The caveat is that we may not be ready to move forward, as numerous loose ends need to be addressed. These issues have been swept under the rug because we’ve been lost in a sea of emotions this past month, when five planets were retrograde, tugging at our heartstrings and making us yearn for the past. It’s no wonder we’ve been in a haze.</p>



<p>As we dust off the stale vibes, the Full Moon calls upon us to be more open with our emotions and discuss them with others. Since the Nodes of Destiny are squaring the lunation, we need to be ready to state our opinions. There can be issues in communication, causing problems with others. Still, if we mentally grow and use this opportunity to be more direct and not hold back, then we will be able to move past the internal conflict and tension that we are feeling. Letting go of our old patterns will be challenging, and we may fluctuate throughout the process. It’ll take a minute, even though we are starting the journey now.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury is still in its “retroshade”</a> phase since the planet ended its retrograde on November 29th. Mercury is still dealing with situations brought on by the retrograde until December 16th, when it clears the post-shadow zone. As a result, we may still be dealing with issues from then, as Mercury is revisiting that timeline. Therefore, it’s essential to think before speaking and not act impulsively, as there may be sensitivities that others feel, including ourselves. Being kind and compassionate is always crucial in times like these, especially since the mutable Supermoon takes on the sentiments of those surrounding them.</p>



<p>Remember that three planets are currently moonwalking in the sky: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter in Cancer</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uranus-retrograde-gemini-taurus-september-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Uranus in Taurus</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/neptune-retrograde-in-aries-pisces-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Neptune in Pisces</a>. While they don’t have an intense or immense impact on us, they’ll reveal the motives of others. They are helping us to understand the importance of living our best lives — no matter what’s gone down in the recent past. The future seems to be prosperous and infinite, giving us an optimistic push toward our aspirations.</p>



<p>This energy is highlighted by the presence of the star Cursa (fixed stars add seasoning to the flavor of planets), which plays an important role during this lunation. Being that Cursa is beneficial and lucky, we’ll be able to get through problems without a hitch. The universe is offering us the opportunity to enhance our fortune by giving us an abundance of love and kindness. Cursa is making us extremely sociable and wanting to connect with others. Beware that it can unlock scandals, so don’t repeat rumors that may or may not be valid. </p>

<p>Amid all the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-cyber-monday-deals"">Cyber Monday sales</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-art-of-giving"">gift season frenzy</a>, and new <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-dresses-2025-latina-brands"">holiday collection drops</a>, the shopping landscape may feel like an avalanche of <em>too many</em> new and shiny things to cart up. But we’re briefly plowing back all of that to shine a light on H&amp;M’s latest (and coveted) collaboration. This time, the reader-favorite retailer has teamed up with luxury ski and lifestyle brand <a href=""https://www.perfectmoment.com/us/en"">Perfect Moment</a> on an après-ski-inspired winter collection. <br /><br />“Après-ski has always had a certain energy: relaxed, comfortable, social, playful, and glamourous,” said Perfect Moment co-founder and creative director Jane Gottschalk, in a press release. “Together [with H&amp;M], we’ve curated a collection that brings the spirit of both brands to life. The pieces are young, fun, [and] sporty, with a winter heartbeat and a nod to the mountains, but belong just as much in the city.” <br /><br />The <a href=""https://www2.hm.com/en_us/ladies/shop-by-feature/2003-perfect-moment-hm.html"">28-piece capsule collection</a> spans versatile knitwear, down-filled outerwear, and statement accessories — like cozy hats and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-puffer-boots"">puffer boots</a> — in a chic winter color palette of black, white, silver, rich burgundy, and icy blue.<br /><br />“We’re thrilled to be collaborating with Perfect Moment on this winter collection — it’s unexpected, dynamic, and sure to spark excitement,” said H&amp;M creative advisor and head of womenswear design, Ann-Sofie Johansson, in the release. “The silhouettes are glamorous yet laid-back — just like après-ski — but also have a real edge with the leather, faux fur, and textured knits.”</p>

<p><em>This Black Friday and Cyber Monday, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">editor-favorite skincare brand Medik8</a> is offering </em><strong><em>30% off sitewide</em></strong><em> from </em><strong><em>November 20 through December 2</em></strong><em>.</em> </p>



<p>As a beauty and shopping writer, I’ve spent countless hours interviewing dermatologists and estheticians, picking their brains for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dermatologist-skin-care-advice"">skincare advice</a> and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/skincare-beauty-products-stop-using-summer"">beauty products</a> they’d happily spend their hard-earned money on. Whenever I ask for recommendations on how to build an effective, no-nonsense routine, one brand comes up time and again: <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8</a>. </p>



<p>There’s a good reason why this <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">British skincare brand</a> has captured the attention of so many in-the-know experts. The brand is most beloved for its <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/crystal-retinal"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Crystal Retinal range</a>, which offers retinal (a vitamin A derivative targeting uneven skin texture and pigmentation) at various concentrations. This tailored approach allows you to find the retinoid strength that works best for your skin without irritation. Other <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8 products</a>, such as the <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/c-tetra-advanced"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">vitamin C serums</a> and <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/advanced-night-ceramide"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ceramide moisturizers</a>, are also highly rated for their efficacy.</p>



<p>Since <strong>Medik8 is currently offering <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">30% off sitewide</a> until December 2</strong>, we couldn’t help but share the bestselling products we’ll be carting up during this major <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-friday-deals"">Black Friday beauty sale</a>.</p>

<p>As someone who has sensitive skin, a product that doesn’t cause an instant uncomfortable reaction is a keeper for Susan Devaney, Refinery29’s lifestyle director. Enter: <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/crystal-retinal?variant=36716424560791"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8 Crystal Retinal 3</a>. “I use it twice a week at night, and I honestly notice my skin feeling softer and brighter when I wake the following day,” she says. Devaney adds, “I’m aware <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"">that retinal</a> [a form of vitamin A that’s more gentle but faster-acting than retinol] helps to keep skin in better shape by targeting hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone. I’m in my 30s, so this feels like a good investment to make for my future self. I apply SPF to my skin daily, too, which is a must when using any retinal product.” </p>

<p>Refinery29’s beauty director Jacqueline Kilikita used <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/total-moisture-daily-facial-cream"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">this moisturizer</a> down to the very last drop, and while this might not seem like an impressive feat, for a beauty editor whose job it is to try everything all at once, it says something about how excellent it is. “I love the cushiony texture that sits somewhere between a gel and a cream; it quenches my parched patches in seconds, all without leaving behind a greasy or tacky residue,” says Kilikita. The star ingredients are peptides (essentially skin-strengthening proteins), hydrating hyaluronic acid, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ceramides-skincare-eczema-dermatitis"">and ceramides</a>, which act like glue in between skin cells to keep them healthy and happy. “For me, ceramides are a must when I choose a moisturizer, especially in the winter when my skin becomes sensitive to cold weather and central heating,” adds Kilikita. Even better? It doesn’t break her out like other face creams. She’s already on her third tub. </p>

<p>Lots of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-vitamin-c-serum"">vitamin C serums</a> leave skin feeling itchy and red, but <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/c-tetra"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8’s C-Tetra</a> is built differently. It contains 7% tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, a stabilized form of vitamin C that doesn’t irritate, and is enriched with nourishing jojoba oil. Reviewers praise this serum for making a difference to their skin’s overall radiance and improving dark spots. The texture is akin to a dry facial oil and feels a lot more moisturizing than most serums. </p>

<p><a href=""https://go.linkby.com/YNQTKZRJ/products/surface-radiance-cleanse?variant=37945194479802"">This gel cleanser</a> was recommended to Refinery29’s beauty director by a dermatologist when she was going through a period of hormonal acne, and she is convinced it helped to clear up her skin. The reason it’s so great for spots is that it boasts exfoliating alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) like lactic acid and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) like salicylic acid. The former chips away at dead skin cells and minimizes the appearance of hyperpigmentation, while the latter goes a little deeper, breaking up the mixture of dead cells, oil, and dirt that clogs pores. While it sounds powerful, it’s actually very gentle and never dries out the skin thanks to a heavy helping of moisturizing glycerin. </p>

<p>Celebrity dermatologist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/drewomaukeleghe/?hl=en"">Dr. Ewoma Ukeleghe</a> once described <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/liquid-peptides"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Liquid Peptides</a> as ‘Botox in a bottle,’ and we couldn’t agree with her more. The star ingredient is a hefty 30% concentration of 10 peptides. If you’re unfamiliar with peptides, they’re essentially proteins that boost collagen and elastin — the two things responsible for keeping skin supple. Despite these powerhouse ingredients, it’s surprisingly lightweight and absorbs quickly. Apply it in the evening and wake up to bouncy skin.</p>

<p>This oil cleanser emulsifies on contact with water, turning into a silky milk that dissolves everything from multiple coats of mascara to heavy foundation and sunscreen — all without drying out your skin. That’s thanks to the mega mix of omega-6, vitamin E, and plant extracts that nourish the delicate skin barrier rather than strip it. There’s a reason beauty editors always fall back on it.</p>

Beyond HA, it features a solid dose of vitamin B5 (also known as panthenol) — an ingredient dermatologists praise for helping lock moisture in. Dry, dehydrated skin? Don’t know her. Better still, it never leaves skin feeling greasy or sticky.</p>

It’s meant to be a ritual. It contains a trifecta of moisturizing ingredients: humectants, which draw moisture into the skin; occlusives, which keep it there; and emollients, which soothe and soften dry, flaky skin. Even after one use of layering the two, you’ll notice that your skin looks fresher and noticeably less parched.</p>

But what's a Christmas without sitting in front of the TV with a glass of champagne in hand, devouring a wholesome, corny or just <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/12/186063/cheesy-christmas-movies-on-netflix"">so bad-it's-good Christmas movie</a>? <br /><br />Whatever you're looking for — a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/christmas-movies-toxic-men"">cheesy rom-com</a> to play in the background while you ice some gingerbread people, a thrilling Christmas <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scariest-movies-of-all-time"">horror with an edge</a>, a Christmas musical that'll have you singing along, or you only want to see <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/set-visit-netflix-knight-before-christmas"">Vanessa Hudgens</a> in another outlandish Christmas film, we've got you covered.<br /><br />Ahead, the very best <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/12/11946456/7-christmas-movies-tv-netflix"">Christmas movies</a> of all time.<figure><figcaption><h2>It's A Wonderful Life (1946)</h2><br />Universally hailed as <em>the</em> best Christmas film to watch each year, <em>It's A Wonderful Life</em> has come to define the genre. It stars Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey, a man who has become suicidal. But he's soon visited by an angel who shows him what really matters in life and what life would be like without his existence. A compelling, moving and heartwarming masterpiece, courtesy of Frank Capra. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Die Hard (1988)<br /></h2><br />Sparking arguments and transforming friends into enemies, <em>Die Hard</em> reinvigorated the discussion on what is meant to be a Christmas movie (and for the record, it definitely is one). Set on Christmas Eve, it follows an NYPD officer (Bruce Willis) as his Christmas plans are interrupted thanks to a group of terrorists (featuring the late Alan Rickman). In true Bruce Willis fashion, he's the only one that can save the day (and Christmas!).  </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)<br /></h2><br />Is it a Christmas movie? Is it a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2023/10/11572922/amazon-prime-halloween-movies-horror"">Halloween movie</a>? Who cares. When you've got a gorgeous stop-motion film as charming as this, you'll be wanting to make your Christmas morning as macabre as possible. Written by the notable Tim Burton, a visit to Christmastown should be on the cards every year (just don't forget to sing along). </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Gremlins (1984)<br /></h2><br />If you think all Christmas movies need to be peppy and upbeat, think again. <em>Gremlins</em> pumps us full of Christmas cheer, but not without the help of some demonic creatures.  This horror-comedy follows a father who finds an extra special Christmas gift for his son, but with a proviso — don't expose it to bright light, never add water, and only feed it after midnight.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Elf (2003)<br /></h2><br />A Christmas staple. Will Ferrell excels in this classic as Buddy, a childish adult/large elf who searches for his biological father in New York City. As he navigates the human world, we're treated to instantly quotable lines and enough laughs to give us an ab workout.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989)</h2><br /><br />Written by John Hughes (best known for classics like <em>Ferris Bueller, Pretty in Pink</em>, and<em> The Breakfast Club</em>), <em>National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation</em> is a bible on how to do a flawless Christmas comedy. Clark Griswold (Chevy Case) wants the perfect Christmas and plays it safe by staying at home, but things go wrong pretty quickly after his hick cousin, Eddie (Randy Quaid) and his family show up without an invite. Watch this, then treat yourself to the other five <em>National Lampoon's Vacation</em> movies, just because.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Carol (2015)<br /></h2><br />Say it with me: more queer Christmas films! <em>Carol</em> has easily cemented itself into the Christmas movie rotation of many thanks to the bittersweet love it portrays. Starring Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett, it follows two women as they fall in love and have a forbidden affair. And while it's just an objectively good movie, it also features plenty of Christmas hats, cookie decorating, and Christmas cheer to fill that festive hole in your heart.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Batman Returns (1992)<br /></h2><br />Batman in a Christmas movie? Well, almost. While Bruce Wayne doesn't exactly don Christmas getup head to toe, <em>Batman Returns</em> landscape is spectacularly festive. With a huge Christmas tree in the centre of Gotham, plenty of decorations to go around, and even a Grinch-esque character in the form of Max Shreck and Penguin, this is the perfect Christmas movie for comic book fanatics.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>How The Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)<br /></h2><br />Have you heard of Whoville? If not, you're in for a treat. It's one of the most wonderfully blissful and friendly places that'll have you returning for your dose of Christmas cheer, every year. We all know who The Grinch is — he's a bloody grouch. He doesn't believe in Christmas and most certainly won't be participating in any local decorating competitions. But things change when he meets six-year-old Cindy Lou. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Bad Santa (2003)<br /></h2><br />Dark comedy and Christmas is an unexpected match made in heaven, seen nowhere better than in <em>Bad Santa</em>. The star of the show, Billy Bob Thornton, stars as a gross, vile, alcoholic, chain-smoking and horny shopping centre Santa Claus ripoff — and we love him for it. Just don't make the mistake of showing this one to the kids. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Holiday (2006)<br /></h2><br />You've got your <em>Love Actually </em>girlies, and you've got your <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2023/11/11596077/is-the-holiday-a-christmas-movie"">The Holiday</a> </em>girlies. Whatever side you fall on, you'll still appreciate this as one of the best Christmas movies of all time. It follows two women (played by Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz) who swap lives and their perfect homes for a fortnight to escape their problems and heartbreak. Jack Black and Jude Law also star in this fan favorite. Someone bring out the mistletoe, stat. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Silent Night (2021)<br /></h2><br />An apocalyptic dystopian Christmas film starring Keira Knightly? Sign me up. After a couple invites their friends over for Christmas dinner, they soon discover that it's their last night on Earth, thanks to a toxic cloud sweeping across the planet. Coined as a ""<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/christmas-horror-film-silent-night"">f*cked up </a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/christmas-horror-film-silent-night"">Love Actually</a></em>"" by Refinery29's own Maybelle Morgan, this gem is satirical, self-aware, and well worth a rotation on your telly over the holidays. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Love Actually (2003)<br /></h2><br />While <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/love-actually-is-the-worst"">polarizing, <em>Love Actually</em></a> is still a firm favorite among many lovers of Christmas movies. With a stellar ensemble cast including Emma Thompson, Jude Law, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, Hugh Grant and more, this 2003 film shows different aspects of love through ten separate stories. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Holidate (2020)<br /></h2><br />Starring Emma Roberts and our own Aussie Luke Bracey who decide to be each other's holiday dates, Holidate is a rom-com with all the predictability and cheesiness we crave come Christmas Eve. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Lord Of The Rings (2001)</h2><br />If <em>The Lord of the Rings </em>wasn't a Christmas movie, then why was it released on Boxing Day every year? Checkmate. A tradition in the Koster residence and our Christmas movie of choice every year, prep yourself to settle down for 10+ hours of Middle Earth shenanigans. One movie for Christmas Eve, one movie for Christmas Day, and one movie for Boxing Day. You're welcome.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Love Hard (2021)<br /></h2><br /><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2021/11/10736711/jimmy-o-yang-love-hard"">Love Hard</a></em> combines romance with the holiday spirit. Starring <em>The Vampire Diaries</em> actress Nina Dobrev, the Netflix original Christmas film sees her character Natalie get catfished when she thinks she's chatting to a dreamy guy, Tag (Darren Barnet from <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2021/07/10586990/most-underrated-line-never-have-i-ever"">Never Have I Ever</a></em>), but it's actually Tag's childhood friend Josh (Jimmy O. Yang).<br /><br />This movie is just as much about the challenges of dating in the online world as it is about our desire for love and connection, especially during the festive season. It's also a big win for Asian representation in Hollywood. As <em>Refinery29 Australia</em> writer Maggie Zhou puts it, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2021/11/10736711/jimmy-o-yang-love-hard"">casting of Jimmy O. Yang as a potential love interest</a> welcomes a change from the problematic stereotypes about Asian men that have so often been perpetuated in Hollywood over the years. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey (2020)<br /></h2><br />With visuals that look like they've been plucked from a storybook, <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2020/12/10222779/jingle-jangle-best-black-christmas-movies"">Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey</a></em> is a cute and fresh Christmas flick from Netflix. It follows a toymaker (Forest Whitaker, no less) and his apprentice (Keegan-Michael Key), who steals one of his prized inventions. It's up to his granddaughter (Madalen Mills) to save the day and reignite the magic. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992)<br /></h2><br />With Michael Caine as Scrooge, Gonzo the Great as Charles Dickens, and a whole bunch of Muppets, <em>The Muppet Christmas Carol </em>has easily cemented itself as one of the most easily recognizable and well-loved Christmas movies out there. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Princess Switch (2018)<br /></h2><br />In what is the best work by <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2021/10/10698806/vanessa-hudgens-nude-photo-leak-2007-reaction"">Vanessa Hudgens</a> since <em>High School Musical</em>, this movie is perfect if you're looking for a 90-minute happily ever come Christmas time. You'll be seeing double because Hudgens plays two women: Stacy DeNovo, a baker who runs a popular pastry shop in America, and Lady Margaret Delacourt, Duchess of Montenaro in Belgravia, London. When they meet, they do their best <em>Parent-Trap</em> style swap of sorts and switch places. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Falling For Christmas (2022)<br /></h2><br />Speaking of <em>The Parent Trap, </em>the Lindsay Lohan renaissance is upon us! And I, for one, welcome our new overlord. <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2022/11/11185134/falling-for-christmas-lindsay-lohan-netflix"">Falling For Christmas</a></em> is a fresh Christmas flick in which Lohan plays a spoiled heiress who loses her memory after a skiing accident. She falls (literally) into the arms of a supremely hot widower. You can probably guess what happens next.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Violent Night (2022)<br /></h2><br />An R-rated Christmas movie? Yes, please. Starring everyone's daddy, David Harbour, this black comedy action flick features a heroic Santa Claus who must step in to save the day after a group of mercenaries attack the estate of a wealthy family.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Home Alone (1990)<br /></h2><br />Another John Hughes classic, <em>Home Alone</em> is a holiday essential. Featuring Macaulay Culkin as the sadistic kid we knew him as, Kevin ends up being left home alone after his preoccupied parents head off on a holiday. Soon, he has to protect his house against burglars — a feat which he accomplishes in a very creative fashion.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Lethal Weapon (1987)<br /></h2><br />In <em>Lethal Weapon</em>, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover gift us with an action-packed thriller that's chock-full of blood and violence. Doesn't quite sound Christmassy? Let this movie convince you otherwise. Shane Black, the MVP of writing screenplays that always somehow involve Christmas, has done it again. This time, it's with two cops on a mission to take down drug dealers — on Christmas, of course. If <em>Die Hard</em> is a Christmas movie, <em>Lethal Weapon</em> should definitely get a seat at the table. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Single All The Way (2021)<br /></h2><br />In an attempt to avoid judgement from his family for being single, Peter (Michael Urie) convinces his bestie, Nick (Philemon Chambers), to pretend that they're in a relationship. Aaaand, cue the romance. If the fake-dating trope isn't enough to reel you in, perhaps some Jennifer Coolidge might do the job.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Tangerine (2015)<br /></h2><br />If you haven't noticed yet, queer Christmas films are excellent. And <em>Tangerine</em> is no exception. Set on Christmas Eve, it follows a pair of transgender women (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez and Mya Taylor), a pair of sex workers who search for a heart-breaking pimp. Shot entirely on an iPhone, it's a cinematic feat as well as just a bloody good Christmas film.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>A Christmas Story (1983)<br /></h2><br />A cult classic, <em>A Christmas Story</em> tells the tale of a young boy who tries to convince his parents, teacher, and Santas Claus that a BB gun is the perfect Christmas gift.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Krampus (2015)<br /></h2><br />Who says Christmas movies can't also be horror? Not us! <em>Krampus </em>is a scary goodie. It features Toni Collette and Adam Scott as they deal with a festive Christmas demon who has been summoned into their home. And you thought Christmas dinner with your conservative uncle was bad.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe (2005)<br /></h2><br />The MVP of cosy movies, <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em> embodies childhood joy. Based on C.S. Lewis' novel, we see four children enter a magical, snowy land through a wardrobe door. Father Christmas even makes an appearance (plus James McAvoy as a very hot half-faun/half-human). <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001)</h2><br />Whilst not explicitly Christmassy, I'm sure many will agree that Harry Potter's first instalment just gives off that fuzzy, Christmas morning feeling. If you don't mind, we'll just be off pretending that we're unwrapping gifts at Hogwarts on Christmas morning.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Knight Before Christmas (2019)<br /></h2><br />In a strange turn of events, Vanessa Hudgens is now known as <em>the</em> Christmas movie star. I know, I didn't see it coming either. In <em>The Knight Before Christmas, </em>she meets a hot medieval English knight (Josh Whitehouse) who magically time-travels to present-day America.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Scrooged (1998)<br /></h2><br />Based on Charles Dickens' novel, <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, <em>Scrooged</em> features Bill Murray as a cynical, mean television exec who's visited by three spirits. Here, they give him a chance to right his wrongs — all on Christmas Eve. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Black Christmas (1974)<br /></h2><br />After a group of sorority girls plan to go away for the Christmas holidays, they're soon confronted by a terrifying stalker. An intelligent, unnerving Chrissie slasher that's <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/best-horror-movies"">a must for any horror fanatic</a>.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>In Bruges (2008)<br /></h2><br />If you're hankering for a not-so-Christmassy Christmas movie, <em>In Bruges</em> should be at the top of your list. Set in Bruges, Belgium, we're treated to a wonderfully festive landscape. The plot, however, isn't as festive — two Irish hitmen, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson), head to Bruges to hide out. But things get complicated when their boss (Ralph Fiennes), asks Ken to kill Ray.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)<br /></h2><br />In possibly the cutest addition to this list, <em>Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer </em>is the epitome of Christmas joy. It's the story we all know and love, but artistically, it's way beyond its years. With groundbreaking stop-motion animation using puppets, you'll find it hard to wipe the smile off your face. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Polar Express (2004)<br /></h2><br />This animated musical adventure is based on the 1985 book of the same name, and as cliché as it sounds, it reminds me of the magic of Christmas that you beautifully embrace as a child and then look back on fondly as an adult. You'll never feel too old to watch this movie, where a young boy who doubts the existence of Santa Claus embarks on a magical adventure to the North Pole aboard the Polar Express train. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Meet Me In St. Louis (1944)<br /></h2><br />Is it even Christmas if you don't listen to a bit of Judy Garland? In this musical masterpiece, we meet four sisters as they learn about life and love, and face their childhood fears.  It makes for perfect background viewing while some gingerbread people decorating, thanks to its stellar soundscape. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Little Women (2019)<br /></h2><br />Set during two life-changing Christmases, Little Women is the perfect Christmas movie. In this soul-crushing and spellbinding adaptation, we follow the March sisters (played by Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson and Eliza Scanlen), as they enter womanhood. With snowy landscapes, Christmas parties, pine trees and fireplace-laced stockings, it's hard to not consider this one of the Christmas greats. Just maybe skip over <em>that</em> marriage proposal scene if you want to keep the mood light. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Eyes Wide Shut (1999)<br /></h2><br />For the anti-consumerist Christmas critics among us (hello!), <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em> is the perfect way to get into the festive spirit. Stanley Kubrick's last film, considered his ""greatest contribution to the art of cinema"", follows Dr. Bill Hartford (Tom Cruise) and his wife, Alice (Nicole Kidman), after she admits to dreaming of having an affair. Everywhere you look, it's hard to ignore that the spirit of Christmas is rife — holiday parties, strung-up lights, toy stores, and mall Santas. But it's not without its criticism. Instead of whimsical, Kubrick presents Christmas as critique of the Western world's obsession with consumerism. File under: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/holiday-movies-sex-scenes"">Christmas movies to watch when you're horny.</a><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Night Before (2015)</h2><br />A Christmas movie for those who flock to stoner comedy (read: any Seth Rogan film), <em>The Night Before</em> features the man himself, as well as Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anthony Mackie as they say goodbye to their years of Christmas traditions in anticipation of fatherhood. With one last night of debauchery, they head to New York and hunt down the elusive Nutcracka ball. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965)<br /></h2><br />An icon in itself, this <em>Peanuts</em> Christmas film tackles Christmas materialism in a lighthearted way as Charlie Brown tries to find a deeper meaning to Christmas. We love some Charlie Brown existentialism!<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Santa Clause (1994)<br /></h2><br />After Tim Allen accidentally causes the death of Santa, he magically transforms into the new big man. A cornerstone of any 90s kid's Christmas,<em> The Santa Clause</em> is a heartwarming story of a dad repairing his relationship with his family.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Happiest Season (2020)<br /></h2><br />Another queer Christmas movies, <em>Happiest Season </em>stars the likes of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/kristen-stewart-spencer-interview"">Kristen Stewart</a>, Mackenzie Davis, Alison Brie, Aubrey Plaza, Dan Levy and more. It follows a woman who struggles to come out to her conservative parents while she and her girlfriend visit them during the Christmas holiday. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Man Who Invented Christmas (2017)<br /></h2><br />In <em>The Man Who Invented Christmas</em>, we take a deep dive into how Charles Dickens wrote one of the most quintessential Christmas tales — <em>A Christmas Carol</em>. Anyone who's had writer's block will resonate.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Four Christmases (2008)<br /></h2><br />There's <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/why-we-love-bad-christmas-movies"">something about objectively bad Christmas films that make them so good</a>. I'll be straight with you — this is not a good movie. But it is a good movie for Christmas. Featuring Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon, a couple spends Christmas Day jumping between family get-togethers after their holiday to Fiji is cancelled.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Dolly Parton's A Christmas On The Square (2020)<br /></h2><br />Everyone's Christmas could do with a little more Dolly Parton. In this campy song-and-dance story, a Scrooge-y woman who's planning on selling off a small town, receives a visit from an angel (Dolly Parton, of course).<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>How The Grinch Stole Christmas (1966)<br /></h2><br />In the original 1966 rendition, Dr. Seuss' classic is told to us true to form as a cartoon spectacle. This Christmas movie is like watching the book come to life. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Spirited (2022)<br /></h2><br />Starring Christmas legend Will Ferrell, and everyone's boyfriend, Ryan Reynolds, this fresh festive flick is a musical version of Charles Dickens' famous story. But with a cast like this, there's no way it's the same story we've seen time and time again.   <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>A Christmas Prince (2017)<br /></h2><br />With a Hallmark essence that's so bad it's good, <em>A Christmas Prince</em> follows a young reporter who is sent abroad to get the scoop on a very hot, very vanilla prince. With a whopping IMDb rating of 5.8/10, it's the perfect bad Christmas film to watch these holidays.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Miracle on 34th Street (1994)<br /></h2><br />Young Susan (played by Mara Wilson of Matilda fame) doesn't believe in Santa. When an elderly man is called in by Susan's mother to replace an intoxicated department store Santa, things start to change. Introducing himself only as Kris Kringle, he claims he's the real Santa Claus, leading to locals trying to sabotage him and landing him in a court case. There's a heartwarming message in this movie about the beauty in believing and Christmas wishes. The 1947 original is also well worth a viewing. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005)<br /></h2><br />Set during Christmas in Los Angeles, this film looks closer to a Christmas in Sydney than it does in a winter wonderland US. In true Shane Black fashion (a la <em>Lethal Weapon</em>), the Christmassy elements are just background noise. But that doesn't make it any less fun. Featuring Robert Downey Jr. and Michelle Monaghan in a sexy Santa suit, <em>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang </em>is a witty crime comedy that doubles as a murder mystery. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Last Holiday (2006)</h2><br />Queen Latifah shines in this early naughties movie that sees her as a saleswoman and budding home chef named Georgia Byrd. After receiving a terminal illness diagnosis, she then uses her life savings to fly to Czechia and spends the last few weeks of her life like a lavish billionaire. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Holdovers (2023)<br /></h2><br />While Christmas time often invites us to watch downright <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2023/11/11605440/cheesy-christmas-movies-on-netflix"">bad holiday flicks</a>, The Holdovers cannot be considered in this category — it's a great Christmas film. In fact, it's a great film, period. Directed by Alexander Payne (of <em>Nebraska</em> and <em>The Descendants</em>), <em>The Holdovers</em> follows a cranky instructor (Paul Giamatti) who's forced to remain on campus during the Christmas holidays to babysit the kids who have nowhere to go. Expect tears.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Best. Christmas. Ever! (2023)</h2><br />Starring Brandy (!) and Heather Graham, Netflix's new Christmas movie, <em>Best. Christmas. Ever!</em> is so bad it's good. Honestly, you don't even need to know the plot of this one to add it to your queue list. It has Brandy in it! I repeat, it has Brandy in it!</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Klaus (2019)</h2><br />This gorgeous hand-drawn animated film is a welcome addition to our Christmas movie rotation. It's sweet, funny, and just oozes that warm nostalgic feeling. It also happens to feature a packed cast, including Rashida Jones, Jason Schwartzman and J.K. Simmons.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022)</h2><br /><br />Whether or not you're a fan of the Marvel movies, <em>The Guardians of the Galaxy</em>'s Christmas special is a go-to if you're after an action-packed holiday film. With a special appearance from Kevin Bacon, we see the usual Guardians crew as they set off on another adventure. It's not the same calibre we expect from the Marvel heavy hitters, but when it's Christmas, don't you just want something fun?</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?
