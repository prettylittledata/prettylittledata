<p>Some types of work only become visible when they are no longer done. They are discrete, repetitive, rarely celebrated, yet they quietly sustain the functioning of any operation. In architecture, this dimension rarely appears in the images that circulate.

Yet the layer that supports these formal gestures is not found in the image, but in specification, detailing, and documentation.</p>",

<h4>A practical guide to designing with code in 2026</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KRmA-I3ubGIeZ53xNAH8lA.png"" /></figure><p>Someone drops a link in a thread — not a deck, not a Figma file — something you can click through, interact with. The conversation shifts from opinions to behavior. This keeps happening <a href=""https://dust.tt/"">at Dust</a>. We’ve been experimenting with making prototypes our default design artifact. The question driving us:</p><blockquote><strong>What should designers produce to help teams decide faster while raising the quality bar and reducing implementation waste?</strong></blockquote><p>We don’t have a final answer yet. This article is a field report: what we’ve tried so far, what seems to work, and what still feels unresolved.</p><h3>Running a design project at Dust</h3><p>I’ll describe the workflow in the order it usually happens. It’s not a rigid process — more a default path we’ve been trying.</p><h4>From “thinking” to “making it real”</h4><p>After the initial analysis and quick sketchbook phase, when I need to give the idea shape and pressure-test it, I don’t open Figma.</p><h4>Create a playground</h4><p>I open my development environment pull the latest version of our repo, and create a branch. Then I ask an agent to scaffold a new prototype, and I describe what I’m trying to make.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DRbolDACpMR1V_In70LESw.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DOcoZx7cEzBj2DpKU2GhqQ.png"" /><figcaption>Our playground environment. Nothing fancy. Each entry is a story.</figcaption></figure><h4>Iterate on behavior, not pictures</h4><p>At this point I mostly care about trying the idea and seeing whether the interaction holds. I’ll build small flows, prototype the transitions, and sanity-check the parts that static screens often hide (state changes, error cases, motion, empty states, keyboard/navigation/accessibility basics).</p><p>I can very easily use realistic fake data. We’ve pre-generated a bunch of it (people profiles, pictures, names, emails, lists of files and folders, entire conversations…). If I need new ones, it’s a matter of seconds to generate them.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tON3pEqQar-RiXwxitNaIg.png"" /></figure><p>Everything runs in the browser, so I’m always looking at the experience at 1:1 scale — at user level. What I see is what user gets.</p><h4>Use the design system by default, bend it when needed</h4><p>During that phase, I don’t optimize for visual polish. I start with behavior and structure; the styling can catch up once the flow holds. The agent naturally builds on our design system (Sparkle), so the prototype reuses our components and tokens from the start.</p><p>If I need a new component or a tweak, I’ll do it on the branch — and only later decide what should become “real” design-system work vs. what was just local exploration.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/56ec6445356d38c3fe402d4ed71afcff/href"">https://medium.com/media/56ec6445356d38c3fe402d4ed71afcff/href</a><h4>Share early</h4><p>Sharing is simple: I push the branch to GitHub and open a PR. My prototype auto-deploys, I can share an easy-to-open URL. GitHub is a natural environment for engineers, so feedback happens where the work lives.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DrhjiRCYmzZAGm4-Ph7BWw.png"" /><figcaption>Automatically generated deploys of storybook and playground.</figcaption></figure><h4>Converge: reduce the diff</h4><p>As iteration loops tightens and I get closer to something final, I start paying attention to:</p><ul><li>introducing just the right new component (and no more)</li><li>making the smallest necessary change in Sparkle</li><li>cleaning up accidental modifications</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YJRrxMU_oCIH4gt-B8WfTQ.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zDHU4GLC-2xydHqT0D8OfA.png"" /><figcaption>Component generated, added to the design system, documented in storybook.</figcaption></figure><h4>Handoff through the PR</h4><p>Engineering handoff is straightforward: it happens through the PR.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mJY1WVDqYtld8WpZcJLHBA.png"" /><figcaption>Design system updates and prototypes.</figcaption></figure><p>I can point to what changed, what needs refining in the design system, and what is “prototype-only”. Engineers can reuse components directly, and use the prototype code as reference — because it runs on the same stack, with the same components.</p><h3>Shortcomings</h3><p>Before going into the setup, a few honest trade-offs we’ve run into:</p><ul><li><strong>It’s still a sandbox.</strong> Unless we simulate it, it won’t naturally reproduce real latency, loading states, and backend weirdness.</li><li><strong>Feedback isn’t perfectly smooth</strong>. Vercel’s preview comments can help, but it’s been a bit flaky for us — screenshots + Slack are still the default.</li><li><strong>You occasionally pay the “code tax.”</strong> Most of the time this is faster than mockups, but occasionally you lose 30 minutes to a silly environment or tooling issue. Quite often, the prototype reveals the brief itself is still fuzzy — or that what we asked for isn’t feasible yet.</li><li><strong>It can invite premature polish</strong>. Because it looks real quickly, it’s easy to get dragged into nitpicks before the core interaction is settled.</li><li><strong>Hand-off clarity</strong>. It’s not always clear with engineers what they should directly re-use and what is prototyping.</li></ul><h3>The Setup</h3><p>Dust runs on React, in a monorepo. Our design system (Sparkle) lives there too. Sparkle gives us two complementary places to work:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://storybook.js.org/""><strong>Storybook</strong></a><strong> </strong>for building and documenting components in isolation (variants, interactions, visual regression). It’s our component catalog.</li><li><strong>Playground</strong> is just a small Vite app nested inside Sparkle. It is a fast development server, it starts quickly, refreshes instantly as you edit, and stays lightweight.</li></ul><p><strong>The key point</strong>: both environments consume the same Sparkle source and Tailwind styles, so prototypes reuse real components and tokens by default.</p><h4>Vercel for easy sharing</h4><p>Vercel is a cloud platform that automatically deploys a GitHub branch as a shareable, live URL. For us, if the branch name contains sparkle, Vercel auto-deploys both Storybook and the Playground and posts preview links in the PR — so sharing a runnable prototype is basically instant.</p><p>One thing we haven’t tried yet: bringing real AI interactions into prototypes — streaming responses, agent behavior, conversational flows. Since Dust is an AI product, that’s a meaningful gap in our current setup. Vercel’s serverless functions could be a way to close it.</p><h4>Coding tools</h4><p>The beauty of this setup is that almost any AI coding tool will work. <strong>Claude Code</strong>, <strong>Antigravity</strong>, <strong>Codex</strong> . My tool of choice is often <a href=""https://cursor.com/agents""><strong>Cursor</strong></a><strong> </strong>(for prototyping), but I move between them freely.</p><p>Notable gap: <strong>Lovable</strong>, which I heavily use and love for personal projects, isn’t a good match here — yet. For good simplicity reasons, it doesn’t handle repos as complex as ours or support the kind of professional-grade git collaboration we need.</p><h4>What about Figma?</h4><p>Don’t believe the catchy “RIP Figma” headlines. Figma hasn’t gone anywhere for us. We still use it upstream for mapping journeys, sketching flows, and running brainstorms; downstream for managing visual assets and illustrations.</p><p>It’s taken a back seat in the middle: the step where you translate an idea into something concrete enough to evaluate. It helps that we never treated Figma as the source of truth for product or design system — <em>truth is in the code</em>. That’s a huge potential efficiency win when you flip to prototyping first.</p><p>A note on Figma Make: we haven’t been convinced by it compared to our own setup. Make is designed to generate code from mockups — which makes sense if mockups are your starting point. But if you flip to prototyping first, it doesn’t play well with an existing codebase.</p><h3>The question underneath: should designers work in code?</h3><p>Behind all the talking is the old debate of technical literacy in design. Should designers code? To what extent? Here’s my current take.</p><h4>Belief #1 — Technical literacy is a design skill</h4><p>I’m an industrial designer by training. In industrial design, understanding your materials is not a “nice to have”. If you don’t know how plastic bends, how aluminum behaves, or what manufacturing constraints do to a shape, you design objects that look right in 3D but fail in the hand.</p><p>Digital products are built with a material too: code. Technical literacy does not necessarily mean coding, but it means understanding how a digital system behaves and why.</p><h4>Belief #2 — Designers working in code can improve quality and speed</h4><p>Having designers work in code can be a real accelerator: tighter feedback loops, fewer handoffs, and less drift between what we design and what ships.</p><p>The catch is that this approach doesn’t scale by default. As organizations grow, the product surface expands, the codebase gets more complex, and the friction adds up. Recruiting designers who can both design and contribute significantly to production code — at scale — is hard to rely on as a core strategy.</p><h4>Belief #3 — “Designers coding” cost-benefit has flipped</h4><p>AI is changing the game on three axes:</p><ol><li><strong>It’s easier.</strong> The “need to know” is shrinking and the cost of learning is going down fast.</li><li><strong>It’s faster.</strong> What used to take hours takes minutes. Once you have a runnable baseline, you can explore variations, states, and interactions at a speed that makes static mockups feel like overhead.</li><li><strong>It’s more powerful.</strong> The amount you can build with limited ability is remarkable — full interaction flows, working components, realistic prototypes.</li></ol><p>I won’t pretend this requires zero knowledge. It doesn’t. But the cost-benefit has flipped: what you can do, and how fast you can do it, makes it hard to justify not putting in the effort to acquire the minimal skills required.</p><h3>What does the future look like?</h3><p>The next step for us is bridging the gap between prototypes and implementation. Today, designers rarely make changes directly in production code . Running a local instance of Dust is heavy, and pushing to a test environment is too slow for tight iteration.</p><p>This is changing extremely fast. More on this soon — but if you’re curious, here’s <a href=""https://dust.tt/blog/engineering-at-the-speed-of-ai"">a technical preview of what we’re working on</a>.</p><h3>Closing</h3><p>I keep coming back to a longer historical loop. Design as a distinct practice really took shape when mass production separated roles that used to live in a single person: the craftsperson who could think, make, and sell the object. Once manufacturing scaled beyond the workshop and those roles split, you needed something that could travel between people and disciplines.</p><p>That something wasn’t just a pretty shape. It was a <em>dessein</em>: a drawing, a plan, a set of intentions constrained by technical reality. In other words: a model of the object, expressed in a format compatible with production.</p><p>Digital product design inherited that logic. Static mockups, specs, flows — they’re all versions of the same move: translating intent into a plan that others can implement.</p><p>But when coding (and prototyping) becomes more accessible we’re not only getting faster at producing plans. <strong>We’re regaining the ability to model directly</strong>.</p><p>More like clay than drafting: you shape, you test, you feel, you adjust — with an instantaneous feedback loop. The artifact is no longer a description of the thing. It starts to become the thing, or at least a runnable slice of it.</p><p>Design is moving from planning experiences to modeling them — closer to reality, earlier, and with tighter feedback loops.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=8581f20102ff"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/field-study-prototypes-over-mockups-8581f20102ff"">Field study: prototypes over mockups</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>On self-surveillance, professional performance, and the cost of forgetting that we built the cage.</h4><figure><img alt=""A translucent mask held in hands with a blurred figure in the background, suggesting the separation between performance and identity."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_gP_nYArWNMnQl8l2rAojQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Is this one me? (All conceptual images in this article were generated by the author using AI.)</figcaption></figure><p>As designers, we live performance twice over: as users who perform constantly, and as the creators of the systems that encourage that performance. This article is about the first, but it inevitably speaks to the second.</p><p>I spent forty minutes choosing a profile picture. Forty minutes taking selfies, testing angles, adjusting light, cropping, thinking about how I wanted to be seen. My professional dignity is somehow correlated to how well I can camouflage my aging. For people I’ve never met. Who may never see it.</p><p>While testing angles, I thought: When did this become normal? Then I did something even worse. Or more practical. Or both — I can’t tell the difference anymore.</p><p>I used an AI tool to “enhance” the photo. Adjust the lighting. Add a studio background. Give it that more “professional” look.</p><blockquote>I literally asked an algorithm to tell me what my face should look like.</blockquote><p>And the most depressing part wasn’t doing it. It was that it worked. The photo was “better.” More presentable. More performative.</p><p>I learned this from an influencer with millions of followers. He shows it with data: posts featuring his face generate 40% more engagement. More likes, more comments, more shares. Translation: more visibility, more clients, more revenue. Except you don’t have time to produce 30 different photos a week. So he uses AI to generate headshots of himself in any context. Very practical.</p><p>If you don’t do it, you’re losing reach. If you’re not doing it now, your competitors already are.</p><p>The logic is impeccable.</p><p>And I tested it. Because the data was clear. And anyone who seriously studies metrics has been doing this for months.</p><p>We went from practical to practical. And we distorted ourselves along the way.</p><h3>The promise that worked</h3><p>To be fair: personal branding was born as a promise of freedom.<br />Before, you depended on gatekeepers. Editors deciding whether your writing deserved to exist. HR deciding whether your résumé was “adequate.” Agencies deciding whether you were “relevant enough.” Your competence only mattered if someone with power gave you permission to show it.</p><p>The internet changed that.</p><p>Designers sharing their process on Behance and landing clients on the other side of the world. Writers publishing directly, without a publisher, building real audiences. That brilliant but shy professional who never shone at in-person networking is finally able to let the work speak for itself.<br />And it worked.</p><p>You wouldn’t be reading this if that weren’t true. A substantial part of those without a platform finally gained a voice. Many voices can now be heard, and that is a humanitarian gain. Opportunities that simply wouldn’t have existed 15 years ago became possible.</p><p>Personal branding was empowerment: controlling your own narrative and deciding who you are, instead of accepting the box they put you in.</p><p>But then the market noticed it was working.</p><blockquote>And did what markets do best:<br />systematized, optimized, monetized, and turned it into an obligation.</blockquote><figure><img alt=""Hand adjusting a translucent mask against a soft-focused background, depicting the continuous refinement of professional performance."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PFmLv0kt5vVpF3k0pPh7_A.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Almost natural. Just one more adjustment.</figcaption></figure><h3>When empowerment became compulsory performance</h3><p>“Show your work” became “perform expertise 24/7.”</p><p>“Be authentic” became “authenticity as a brand strategy — here are 10 templates.”</p><p>“Build an audience” became “monetize every second of attention or you’re wasting your potential.”</p><p>And “follow these steps” became the promise that you might finally be seen in an ocean of people competing for attention.</p><p>What was optional became mandatory to survive.</p><p>And again we bought in. Because it works. Those who perform better grow faster. Those who aren’t seen aren’t remembered. Those without a personal brand have no market.</p><p>So you and I performed. And we performed well.</p><h4>We became the product</h4><p>We became a Coca-Cola that needs a logo, a tagline, an editorial calendar, a conversion funnel, alignment with causes, and constant optimization.<br />And now, an increasingly common strategy: turn on the camera. Reels. Stories. Short videos. For some, text is no longer enough. Show your face in motion. Speak directly. Rehearse spontaneity twelve times until it looks natural.</p><p>That uncomfortable task of selling yourself publicly. Of talking alone to a camera. Of feigning naturalness while repeating the same hook three times until it sounds “authentic.”</p><p>The logic is clear: the algorithm prioritizes video, “people trust people.” Showing your face has become synonymous with credibility.</p><p>So they record. Edit. Re-record. Post. And hope those fifteen seconds of filmed discomfort generate the numbers that justify the effort.</p><blockquote>They called it “personal branding.” As if you were a product. We objectified ourselves.</blockquote><p>And what does refusing mean? Becoming invisible in a market where visibility has become a condition of existence.</p><p>We show the quality of our work and what makes us unique — but through so many layers of optimization and strategic performance that the line between substance and packaging begins to disappear. We sell edited versions of ourselves — myself included — for the market to consume.</p><h4>It’s a silent escalation</h4><p>If only this were just a problem of photos.</p><p>It has migrated into everyday communication. That email with eight people copied? You know exactly what happens. Heightened attention. Every word calculated. You’re not writing to communicate — you’re performing competence for an audience you imagine judging every comma.</p><p>And we find ourselves wondering: How will so-and-so read this? What if someone takes it the wrong way? Does this sentence sound confident or arrogant? Is this tone collaborative or passive?</p><p>We edit.</p><p>Re-edit.</p><p>Save the draft.</p><p>Come back.</p><p>Change one word.</p><p>Send.</p><p>And breathe.</p><p>One more theater of efficiency.</p><figure><img alt=""A sharp, in-focus mask in the foreground with a blurred human figure behind it, showing the mask becoming clearer than the person."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aTGFWrN1Hsbecodms47WEg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>I definitely look better this way.</figcaption></figure><h3>The mask that became a face</h3><p>At work, the performance is even more explicit. We have to put on the mask of “I’m the most incredible person you have.” Nothing more than structural survival.</p><p>If you don’t show up, you’re not remembered when promotions come around. Visible performance matters more than silent work. The clarity of your reports ends up defining your perceived reliability.</p><p>So we send weekly reports that are 70% real work, 30% personal marketing. “Key achievements this week,” we write, as if we’d won the space race. That presentation where you rehearsed your “spontaneous contribution” multiple times to impress the people who matter. That calculated moment of waiting a few minutes before responding on Slack, fast enough to seem available, but not so instant that you look desperate or like you have nothing real to do.</p><h4>And it works. Of course it works.</h4><p>Managers love employees who are clear, proactive, communicative. Organizational efficiency improves. Engagement goes up. Everyone wins.</p><p><strong>Does it, though? What’s the cost?</strong></p><p>The cost is invisible but real. Time spent editing messages instead of thinking through the problem that actually needs solving. Mental energy wasted anticipating imaginary judgments. The constant anxiety of being misunderstood or forgotten.</p><p>Professional decisions made based on “what will look good,” until you forget what actually matters.</p><p>Because beneath all this performative efficiency, there’s exhaustion. A permanent sense of inadequacy. You never sent all the updates you should have. Never participated in all the strategic meetings. Never read all the messages or the endless email threads. Never took enough initiative in company-wide meetings. Never had enough visibility to be remembered when the promotion came.</p><p>And the more you try, the more you confirm that <strong>you’re not enough</strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""Two hands pressed against a translucent barrier from inside, palms open, depicting confinement in a self-built prison."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*c0DUYalI8FDA_Lcx8JcVGA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>What was the way out again?</figcaption></figure><h3>Voluntary prisoners</h3><p>We built our own prison. There is no captor. No explicit coercion. But there are invisible bars, internalized, real. Bars made of constant visibility, of public metrics, of social validation as the currency of professional survival.<br />And we built them. Post by post.</p><p>It’s a practical necessity. Your career and market relevance depend on it. You perform without even noticing. Until you lose the ability to distinguish what you want from what you need to demonstrate.</p><p>I say this as someone who has already built a platform. Portfolio, clients, margin. What about those trying to enter? There’s no “before performing.” You start already performing. The prison has floors. Some think about leaving. Others, about getting in. That doesn’t invalidate the critique. It just situates who has the margin to make it.</p><h4>Nothing worse than becoming a voluntary enforcer</h4><p>That colleague who delivers exceptional work but doesn’t post their process? “They need to learn to communicate better.”</p><p>That designer who doesn’t update their portfolio every month?<br />“Doesn’t know how to sell themselves.”</p><p>You’ve internalized the logic so thoroughly that you now police it for free.<br />And when someone criticizes the system, we feel indignation. Almost a personal attack.</p><p>“Well, I grew because of it. You’re being naive; this is just how the world works now.”</p><p>Someone pointed at the prison, and we explained why the bars are necessary.</p><figure><img alt=""A heart shape drawn on a foggy glass barrier with hands visible below, representing affection directed toward one’s own confinement."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mCfzlDWITl7GOUI6JwHReQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Privileged to be here.</figcaption></figure><h3>And we’re still grateful</h3><p>The results are real. That client from networking, that promotion, they happened. Visibility works. For those who need to build material security, this isn’t superficial.</p><p>The problem arises when we lose the ability to distinguish: am I doing this because I chose to, or because I can no longer imagine any other way of existing professionally?</p><p>And when we achieve something?</p><p><strong>Genuine gratitude, or a performance of contentment?</strong></p><p>I don’t even know anymore.</p><p>So we post about gratitude. About the “privilege of doing what you love.” About lessons from the journey. About how our team is “the most incredible family in the world,” how the company culture “transforms lives.”</p><p>#grateful.</p><h4>The moment identity disappears</h4><p>But there comes a moment, sooner or later, when that thought surfaces.<br />“That opinion I posted… do I actually believe it, or was it because it would generate engagement?”</p><p>“That project I chose… did it interest me, or did it just make better content?”</p><p>“That moment of introspection…</p><p>Did I need to think?</p><p>Or was I already performing introspection?”</p><p>And maybe we no longer know. We’ve performed for so long that we don’t know who we’d be without it.</p><figure><img alt=""A blurred interface or document visible through translucent glass with a human figure observing it, symbolizing designers viewing their own creations."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tnPAz5xqu5ndwIUuZIv8Ug.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Ready for personal use.</figcaption></figure><h3>And who designs all this?</h3><p>Us. Designers, UX, product managers.</p><p>I’m not saying we do it in bad faith. Most genuinely believe they’re “improving the experience.” But let’s be honest about what that means:<br />Public validation metrics — views, likes, shares — so you know in real time exactly how well you’re performing.</p><ul><li><strong>The “seen” receipt <br /></strong>It obligates you to respond immediately, or perform an excuse.</li><li><strong>“Typing…”<br /></strong>It makes you rewrite your message knowing they can see you typing.</li><li><strong>Who viewed your profile<br /></strong>Sold as a premium feature. Monetizing paranoia.</li><li><strong>Your profile is 73% complete<br /></strong>Amanufactured sense of being unfinished.</li><li><strong>Seen by 47 people<br /></strong>Paranoia about who saw it and said nothing.</li><li><strong>Active now</strong> <br />Logging in as a public declaration of presence.</li></ul><p>Interfaces designed to manipulate decisions. Features that create behavioral dependency. Architectures that hijack your time.</p><p>All of this has a name. <a href=""https://www.deceptive.design/""><strong>Dark patterns</strong></a>. <strong>Addictive design</strong>. <strong>Attention capture</strong></p><p>Every discomfort you feel was engineered.</p><h4>And it worked. Better than we imagined.</h4><p>We built systems so efficient that they now face litigation. <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2026/01/27/nx-s1-5684196/social-media-kids-addiction-mental-health-trial"">Meta and YouTube for addictive design</a>. <a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/09/ftc-secures-historic-25-billion-settlement-against-amazon"">Amazon fined for impossible cancellation flows</a>. <a href=""https://www.digital-fairness-act.com/"">The European Union classified 97% of the most popular App Store applications as containing dark patterns</a> and began regulating the sector.<br />But when you’re on the product team, the metrics make sense.

Developing tools that don’t just observe your performance — they help you perform better. With data, insights, algorithmic empathy.</p><blockquote>And the worst part: we’ll accept it. Because refusing means falling behind.</blockquote><p>The pieces already exist. <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68067022"">Amazon uses tracking systems — wristbands and scanners that monitor warehouse workers’ productivity every second</a>, generating “idle time” metrics. Microsoft Viva analyzes your communication patterns and productivity. Humanyze monitors tone of voice and body language in interactions. Insurance companies offer discounts in exchange for health data.</p><p>In isolation, each seems reasonable. But when they talk to each other?<br />You stay late working on an urgent proposal. Your laptop logs nighttime productivity. Your smartwatch logs insufficient sleep. Your calendar shows six meetings in one day.</p><p>The system infers: “Problematic time management. Procrastination during working hours. Burnout risk.”</p><p>You probably won’t be consulted. The system will build a behavioral profile you’ve never seen, but that your manager can access. That interface is likely already being built by talented designers and engineers, perhaps even well-intentioned ones, who believe they’re solving real problems.</p><h4>And how will it be sold?</h4><p>“Empowerment through data.”</p><p>“Enhanced self-awareness.”</p><p>“Personalized support.”</p><p>The messaging will be empathetic, careful, almost moving.<br />But you didn’t define what “healthy” looks like. They did. You didn’t choose to be monitored. You just accepted it, because refusing would mean “not caring about your own development.”</p><p>It’s the same logic as the profile picture.</p><p>Every step is perfectly rational. Supremely practical.</p><p><strong>And we keep distorting ourselves.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""A person’s hands held together in contemplation, clearly visible without barriers, suggesting awareness and presence outside of performance."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y5ddbSG-7Q71-zTZ8h_vrA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Here I am.</figcaption></figure><h3>There any redemption?</h3><p>I don’t believe the solution is deleting your account or retreating to the woods. And you probably won’t stop performing — I won’t. The game exists. Refusing to play is a privilege most people don’t have.<br />But there is a difference between performing with the awareness that it’s theater, and believing that the theater is you.</p><p>If you need to edit the photo to get in the game, that’s fine. A diplomat wears a suit, a doctor wears a white coat; you wear a profile picture. We put on masks because the world demands it. This is ritual, contingent on the moment we’re living in. It is neither eternal nor natural.</p><p>The problem was never the mask. It was forgetting you were wearing one.<br />I write this knowing that this very text participates in the same structure, it will be shared, and it will be performed. Awareness of the theater doesn’t take me off the stage. It only reminds me that I’m on it too.</p><p>But what makes us sick is not the performance itself, it’s the sustained lie. The manager who posts about human-centered culture while expecting replies at 11pm. The designer who celebrates inclusivity but never questions the product’s exclusionary metrics. The professional who performs gratitude while feeling nothing but exhaustion.</p><p>Awareness of the theater is what prevents moral dissonance. When you know it’s performance, you preserve mental energy for what truly matters. Your family. Your values. Your actual competence.</p><figure><img alt=""A person with hands in reflective pose, with a blurred screen or interface visible in the background, depicting conscious work and agency."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uAr7q8SqhJ6CiUlqhZZeVA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>What if I changed this?</figcaption></figure><h4>And us, as designers?</h4><p>For us, creators of systems, designers, UX, product managers, there is always a gap.</p><p>A gap between “what the metric demands” and “what I know is right.”</p><p>A gap between “what will perform better in the A/B test” and “what won’t leave the user feeling manipulated afterward.”</p><p>The gap isn’t always navigable. There are moments when the system leaves no room, when the choice is between compromising the design or compromising the paycheck.</p><h4>But the gap exists.</h4><p>And culture is never static. It is always transforming. What holds value today becomes irrelevant tomorrow. What seems inevitable today, five years from now, is embarrassing.</p><p>Remember when smoking on planes was normal? When doctors recommended cigarettes? When asbestos was the “material of the future”? When tobacco advertising sponsored Formula 1? When children’s advertising had no limits? When drunk driving was socially tolerated? When no one wore a seatbelt?</p><p>I know, the damage of the attention economy is different. It’s diffuse, psychological, subjective. You can’t prove in court that the infinite scroll “caused” your anxiety the way cigarettes caused cancer.</p><p>So the change will be slower. More fragmented. It won’t be “we banned dark patterns.” It will be “some companies realize that trust is worth more than engagement, and that becomes a competitive advantage.”</p><p>Change doesn’t come overnight. It comes from accumulated small acts of resistance. From designers who, when they can, choose not to add that manipulative feature. From PMs who advocate for satisfaction metrics, not just time-on-platform. From companies that realize — late, but realize — that trust is worth more than predatory engagement.</p><h4>The market transforms.</h4><p>Fines, lawsuits, and regulations have already begun to appear. Companies are changing because it’s become too costly to stay the same. The market is extremely fluid and hates losing money.</p><h4>Perception transforms.</h4><p>Users already know they’re being manipulated. Teenagers already say “I know this is addictive, but I can’t stop.” Parents are already looking for basic phones for their children. Entire generations growing up distrustful of likes. Books like Jonathan Haidt’s The Anxious Generation and Johann Hari’s Stolen Focus are worldwide bestsellers.</p><p>None of this comes close to solving everything. But it creates space.<br />It creates conditions for products to function without depending on addiction. For professionals to build a presence without constant theatricality. For the process — not just the polished result — to hold recognized value.</p><p>And when designers, creators, and builders of systems begin to see our own complicity, the tools we create begin to change too.</p><p>Because we realize that systems that consume people eventually consume us as well.</p><p>Redemption, if it exists, is not individual. It is not “I saved myself, good luck to the rest.” It is collective, far slower than it should be, and full of setbacks.</p><p>But it is possible.</p><p>Small cracks in the system. Minimal gestures, repeated until they become culture. We stay in the game, but play it a little differently. A little more consciously.</p><p>And when we have the choice, we can choose to lie a little less.</p><p>Maybe it won’t change the world. But it keeps a piece of you intact.</p><p>And that, in itself, is already a beginning.</p><h4>To continue the conversation</h4><p>Thank you for following me through this reflection.

<h4>The future of digital advertising should feel less like a distraction and more like recommendations from a friend.</h4><figure><img alt=""A delicate watercolor and graphite sketch of a smartphone screen showing a chat interface where one specific message bubble is glowing with a warm, golden light, symbolizing a high-utility, relevant answer"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3gimrvTxVY4VhPIvGKaU5A.png"" /><figcaption><em>High relevance ads could enhance the quality of the content.</em></figcaption></figure><p>I’m a <strong>product designer</strong> and for the last four years I have been working in digital advertising for tech. I wouldn’t have imagined building part of my career in advertising, but here I am, and I have found myself honestly enjoying the challenge. Through this experience, I have learned that <strong>healthy and fair advertising</strong> is actually a good thing for the industry. It helps brands reach people, and it helps people find what they are looking for. When ads are well-executed, they are great content. There have been amazing pieces of advertisement across history, and when you pair great ads with great products, magic happens.</p><p>A few days ago, ChatGPT started <a href=""https://openai.com/index/testing-ads-in-chatgpt/"">testing ads</a> within its conversations. The first screenshots show a safe and expected approach: a user starts a conversation around a specific vertical, the model gives a standard AI answer, and then it shows an ad related to the conversation keywords. This replicates the model used in other media platforms by capturing signals and showing inventory that matches them. It’s a safe starting point, but it feels simplistic considering the possibilities of AI. There should be a more sophisticated way to do this. We need a model that treats ads not as an interruption, but as <strong>high-utility content</strong> that actually improves the experience.</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of a ChatGPT interface showing a ‘Potluck power tips’ response followed by a sponsored ad from ‘Heirloom Groceries’ for an Enchilada Kit, featuring price, stock status, and a small product image."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KHxGNphfpnapvof7EIbXog.jpeg"" /><figcaption><em>OpenAI’s initial test displays ads as sponsored links following a conversational response.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The immediate reaction from many is that ads in ChatGPT will harm the user experience. I think that if the strategy is well executed, it could <strong>improve the quality of recommendations</strong>. My rationale is based on the <strong>data source</strong>. When platforms create an ad ecosystem, they have a real incentive to digest merchant catalogs, local service listings, and travel databases. Once this content is set up for advertisers, it can be used to power general responses, too.</p><p>Currently, when you ask ChatGPT about a product or local service, it likely scrapes multiple websites. This doesn’t guarantee the metadata is right or updated. A <strong>direct integration</strong> with a business’s database ensures freshness and reliability. It is the technical difference between scraping a UI and communicating directly through an <strong>API</strong>. I don’t doubt that advertisers, from global retailers to local barber shops, are waiting for the moment they can upload their catalogs and service lists directly to OpenAI. As <a href=""https://www.roidna.com/blog/advertising-in-the-age-of-llms-what-happens-when-ai-becomes-the-ad-platform/"">industry reports from <strong>ROI·DNA</strong></a> suggest we are entering an era where brand-verified catalogs become a fundamental part of the reasoning layer, allowing the model to ground its advice in high-quality, real-time data rather than just scraped noise.</p><p>Think of it this way: if you ask about running shoes today, the model analyzes your context and scrapes the web. It reads reviews and influencer videos, but it is unlikely to find professional, unbiased benchmarking. Most of these sources already have sponsored rankings, so the content is already biased by <strong>SEO games</strong>. The model might show you an organized summary, but it’s coming from already <strong>biased and probably sponsored sources</strong>. The products might also be out of stock or the technical specs might be outdated.</p><p>In a new model, the AI would bypass this noise by directly integrating with <strong>rich catalogs</strong> of shoes, boutique hotels, or specialized medical services. These databases include real-time price, stock, and local availability. When doing research, the model could cross-reference this first-hand data with community reviews or scientific research. This also <strong>levels the playing field</strong>, as smaller, local brands could be part of that same inventory.</p><p>By leaning into this infrastructure now, OpenAI is pulling ahead of most competitors. They are building a better recommendation experience under the guise of an ad network, establishing the <strong>technical pipes required for commerce </strong>before others even begin. <strong>Google</strong> remains a unique incumbent here. Through its shopping features, it has spent years perfecting an ecosystem of real-time merchant data. While Google may be better positioned to activate these features when they decide to fully commit to AI ads, OpenAI’s moves are defining a new standard for what a helpful recommendation engine in the AI world looks like.</p><p>My take on the recent <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De-_wQpKw0s"">Anthropic ad campaign</a>, which brilliantly mocks the scenario where ads become intruders in the conversation, is that while it is a great piece of marketing, it only addresses the “noisy” version of advertising. In a scenario where ads are treated as high-quality, verified content, this satirical picture no longer fits. More importantly, LLMs that fail to integrate these APIs and catalogs soon risk falling behind in the race to provide the best commercial recommendations because that is a primary use case for AI users today.</p><p>I often think of the analogy of a friend recommending a product. If you tell a friend who is passionate about bikes that you’re looking for a weekend ride, they don’t just shout a brand name at you. They ask about your taste, your budget, and your local terrain. They are a friend first, understanding your context before suggesting a solution. This is the difference between <strong>advertising as noise and advertising as advice.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""A minimalist watercolor study of two friends sitting at a cafe table; one is gesturing while a faint, sketched bicycle appears as a shared thought between them."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QNSAdwJd_H2s30QaPRdENg.png"" /><figcaption><em>AI recommendations should feel like a conversation between friends.</em></figcaption></figure><p>This analogy brings us to a <strong>“neutrality paradox.”</strong> A good AI analysis should rank options based on what is actually best for the user, rather than who paid the most. Critics will rightly ask: how can the model remain an unbiased advisor if it’s also the salesperson? To get this right, OpenAI must maintain a <strong>strict wall</strong> between the model’s reasoning and the ad auction. The AI should first determine the ideal solution for the user, and only then see if there is an ad that matches that specific intent. If the best suggestion happens to be sponsored content, everyone wins. If the model starts nudging users toward an ad just to hit a revenue target, the trust is gone.</p><p>For this neutrality to feel real, it has to be visible. This means following the rules of digital advertising, like <strong>clear labeling</strong>. If a recommendation is sponsored, the user should know exactly why it’s there and have the power to opt out or mute specific ads entirely. Trust isn’t built by camouflaging the ads, it’s built by giving the user <strong>visibility and control</strong>.</p><p>This new paradigm also has massive implications for <strong>user agency</strong>. Think of a scenario where, when planning a trip, the model surfaces a tiny local coffee shop that just opened in your destination: a business that otherwise could never afford to compete with big brands for global SEO. Perhaps because the user specifically asked for small local businesses. For this to work, OpenAI has to solve the <strong>“pay to play”</strong> barrier. If only the giants can afford to bid, the user’s preference for local shops becomes a dead end. A fair game requires a model where relevance and values can occasionally outrank a large ad budget.</p><figure><img alt=""A warm, glowing watercolor of a small local coffee shop storefront standing out in vibrant color against a muted, grey-sketched city background."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3ylFl0Cshsq07DBHsYxJFg.png"" /><figcaption><em>Find local businesses that matter to you.</em></figcaption></figure><p>This leads to a shift away from one-way communication. Most ads today are static broadcast. In this new model, an ad becomes a <strong>two-way dialogue</strong>. Instead of a generic banner, the ad can become an interactive experience that answers specific questions about a product’s features. It moves from interruption to <strong>consultation</strong>, surfacing only the parts of a product relevant to your current need. The model becomes more like a great salesperson that answers your questions, one who knows when to say, “I have nothing to offer you right now, but it was great having a conversation with you.”</p><p>This approach also enables better <strong>discovery</strong>. Traditional search is limited by what we know to ask for. In a conversation, an AI can identify a need that the user hasn’t yet put a name to. This is a shift toward a discovery-based experience, similar to what platforms like <strong>Pinterest</strong> have spent years perfecting. As <a href=""https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/ads-candidate-generation-using-behavioral-sequence-modeling-f9077ee1325d"">Pinterest Engineering notes</a>, ads are most effective when they are designed to inspire and connect users with ideas they genuinely love rather than acting as a simple distraction.</p><p>Of course, this level of personalization raises the stakes for privacy. To be the “friend” in the analogy, the AI needs to understand your context deeply, but that data must remain a private secret. The real opportunity is in <strong>zero-knowledge advertising</strong>, where an advertiser knows their ad was shown to the right person, but never knows who that person is or what they said to the AI. The proof of success will be found in ad performance, not data harvesting.</p><p>Ultimately, the success of this shift depends on one thing: OpenAI’s willingness to be rigorous enough to <strong>decide when not to show an ad</strong>. The business hunger for growth often leads platforms to flood every empty space with sponsored content. If OpenAI shows an ad just to collect the incentive, even when it doesn’t truly help the user, they become just another search engine. If they make it right, they can leverage the power of the ads as content.</p><p>There are broader challenges in the AI landscape that need to be addressed. Like any powerful technology, AI must be governed by priorities like safety and ethics. <strong>Safety concerns must always come first.</strong> It is only when all necessary guardrails are met, and the model identifies a clear and safe shopping intent, that a healthy advertisement ecosystem can exist.</p><p>This new paradigm opens a significant opportunity for ads to evolve from a <strong>tax on our attention</strong> into a <strong>service for our needs</strong>. A well-executed advertisement could be a win for everyone involved. We’re jumping into the <strong>next phase of human history</strong>, and yes, there will be ads. I don’t think anything will stop this change, so the best thing we can do is get it right by ensuring the value of the answer is never traded for the price of the ad. That’s what I’m hoping to happen.</p><p><strong><em>Rodrigo Osornio</em></strong><em> is a San Francisco-based product designer with training in visual arts and industrial design.

<figure><img alt=""A glasses with floating UI on it. AI-Generated image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RDWf03gEFMyyNtIVGJpa2g.jpeg"" /><figcaption>AI-generated image based on the original from this article <a href=""https://www.queppelin.com/ar-glasses-for-navigation/"">https://www.queppelin.com/ar-glasses-for-navigation/</a></figcaption></figure><p>When I talk about AR glasses, I don’t mean bulky headsets. I mean devices that look like regular eyewear capable of whispering information into your ear and displaying 3D content or flat panels overlaid on the real world.</p><p>This article is neither a validation of the technology nor a criticism, it is an objective personal look at what I see coming. Here are five reasons why I believe AR glasses will succeed and become mainstream, along with the consequences designers and users must face.</p><h3>1. Solving the “Kidnapped Body” problem</h3><figure><img alt=""An illustration of a woman looking at the phone. AI-Generated image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Kv1QO5wUplFqomrm1QmdGg.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Mobile devices demand a high physical price. They force us to look down, occupy our hands, and monopolize our attention. I call this the “kidnapped body” problem. We pay this price without thinking, but the implications are profound. It severs us from the physical world, blocking out views, people, and genuine connection.</p><p>We have even developed medical terms for this. “<a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11856789/"">Tech Neck</a>” describes the repetitive stress injury caused by constantly looking down at a screen. AR glasses may succeed because they liberate the body. They return our hands to us and, more importantly, they lift our chins. By allowing us to look up and ahead, they reintegrate us into the world. While they will for sure introduce new distractions, the shift from “head-down” to “heads-up” computing is a fundamental ergonomic correction that users will gravitate toward.</p><h3>2. The new, no-new device</h3><figure><img alt=""A woman smiling grabbing her glasses. AI-Generated image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zGXPyqrNH8iLmzgZrqIbKw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>In a gadget-saturated world, introducing a completely new device is risky. However, AR glasses have a secret weapon. They aren’t “new.” They are just glasses.</p><p>Global estimates suggest around <a href=""https://www.overnightglasses.com/eyewear-industry-statistics/#:~:text=Globally%2C%20at%20least%202.2%20billion,for%202023%20was%20$65.6%20billion."">4 billion people already wear glasses</a> for various reasons, with over <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/blindness-and-visual-impairment"">2.2 billion people having a near or distance vision impairment</a> according to the World Health Organization. The form factor is familiar, socially accepted, and worn daily. The friction to adoption is incredibly low compared to a VR headset. Much like the Apple Watch which sold 12 million units in its breakout year by leveraging the centuries-old habit of wearing wristwatches. As long as they look like iconic eyewear rather than tech hardware, they are primed for mass adoption.</p><h3>3. The Spatial Canvas (Escaping the Screen)</h3><figure><img alt=""An illustration of a busy street seen from the perspective of a person with AR glasses. The street is full of floating user interface. AI-Generated image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*a-BfGo5NIZp_uzQbQHmxCg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>AI-generated image based on the original from this article <a href=""https://www.crunchfish.com/how-does-the-world-look-through-smart-glasses/"">https://www.crunchfish.com/how-does-the-world-look-through-smart-glasses/</a></figcaption></figure><p>There is a multi-million-dollar industry currently trapped behind 6-inch glass rectangles. Tech giants from phone manufacturers to app developers are hitting the limits of what can be done on a 2D flat screen.</p><p>The physical world is a “green field” for these companies, a massive, unclaimed canvas for digital overlay. Whether we like it or not, the push to colonize our surroundings with digital content is the next logical growth engine for the tech sector.</p><p>For product designers, this represents the most significant paradigm shift ever seen. We are moving from designing within a constrained frame to designing without borders. Eventually, we will no longer design apps that “trap” users, we will design apps that enhance the environment. This shift to “Spatial Computing” will unlock entirely new economies and user behaviors that flat screens simply cannot support.</p><h3>4. Strong Use Cases</h3><figure><img alt=""A floating user interface seen from inside a car. AI-Generated image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dDpTz4QCVcDT2OR8tmirpA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>AI-generated image based on the original from this article <a href=""https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/envisics-ar-windshield-technology/"">https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/envisics-ar-windshield-technology/</a></figcaption></figure><p>The utility of placing digital objects into the physical world is undeniable. While current iterations act as a Heads-Up Display (HUD) rather than fully immersive AR, they are the necessary bridge to the future.</p><p>Apps designed for physical interaction will thrive first:</p><ul><li><strong>Exploration and Learning:</strong> This is perhaps the strongest long-term use case. You could stand in front of a historical monument and instantly see contextual history overlaid on the stone. You could look at a complex car engine and see step-by-step repair labels pointing to the exact parts you need to touch. It turns the entire world into an interactive learning manual.</li><li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Arrows overlaid on the street as you walk, allowing you to converse with friends without checking a phone map.</li><li><strong>Cooking:</strong> Hands-free recipes floating above the counter.</li><li><strong>Safety:</strong> The ability to livestream to emergency services instantly during dangerous situations could be a significant deterrent to crime.</li><li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> For users with disabilities, these glasses can provide real-time context, enhance visual contrast, or narrate the environment instantly empowering users without requiring active intervention.</li></ul><p>As product designers we can already start exploring how to design for AR glasses in Google’s documentation for instance, in this <a href=""https://design.google/library/transparent-screens"">article</a>, David Allan Reese talks about how to design with daylight, UI components sizes, contrast, space awareness and more. You can also take a look at how Google’s AR UI kit, <a href=""https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/jetpack-xr-sdk/jetpack-compose-glimmer"">Jetpack Compose Glimmer</a>, looks like. On the other hand, Meta has also released its <a href=""https://wearables.developer.meta.com/docs/develop"">documentation </a>about developing and designing for Ray-Ban Meta Glasses.</p><h3>5. Voice Interaction Made Natural</h3><figure><img alt=""An illustration of a woman with an AR glasses touching the right side of them simulating touching the volume. Some sound player UI floating next to the hand. AI-Generated image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mEhRbXCbvv-XrjkMYjF2kg.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Historically, conversational interfaces have suffered from poor reputations. They were often frustrating and limited. However, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has fundamentally changed this.</p><p>Conversational AI is becoming natural, instant, and context-aware very fast. When you combine competent AI with the “hands-free” nature of glasses, voice becomes a crucial input system. The social awkwardness of talking to a device will likely fade, much like how wearing wireless earbuds 24/7 went from “rude” to “normal.”</p><h3>The Consequences</h3><p>If this technology succeeds, we must be prepared for two major friction points, particularly from a design perspective:</p><p><strong>1. The Privacy Paradox</strong> Privacy concerns run in two directions. First, what are manufacturers capturing about our daily lives? Second, how do we manage peer-to-peer privacy? The “always-on” camera creates uneasiness in social environments. How will society regulate recording in public? Will hacking the “recording LED” become common? These social contracts will need to be rewritten, and many users may reject the tech simply to opt out of this surveillance state.</p><p><strong>2. Spatial Invasion and New UX Patterns</strong> If the world becomes a digital canvas, who owns the rights to that space? We risk a future of “spatial spam” ads anchored to physical storefronts, landmarks, or even sidewalks. Without strict regulation, the tranquility of the real world could be interrupted by pop-ups and notifications that we cannot swipe away.</p><p>For designers, this raises critical ethical questions. What is the “dark pattern” of spatial design? How do we design a safe mode mechanism for the real world? We may see the rise of aggressive attention-grabbing patterns that intentionally block your view. Designers will have the heavy responsibility of defining the etiquette of this new layer. Will we design respectful interfaces that blend in, or intrusive billboards that demand attention? We may not see the regulations put in place until after the intrusion has already begun.</p><h3>To wrap up</h3><p>AR glasses introduce a new reality, literally. They’ll bring with them as many opportunities as there are threads of concern. For product designers, the challenge is not just to be ahead of the trend, but to deeply understand what this technology adds to or subtracts from human life.</p><p>Personally, I am fascinated by a future enhanced by this technology, a life where reality is augmented to help and delight us. However, we have seen how initial excitement can turn into unforeseen consequences. Social media reminds us of how a tool for connection can evolve into a mental health crisis. By the time we realized the damage, it was already too late for some generations.</p><p>I believe in the power of individual common sense, but I also know that mass adoption shifts behavior in unpredictable ways. I hope this article has sparked your interest and encouraged you to investigate further. We are facing a fascinating technological horizon, and it is up to us, designers and users, to ensure it remains a tool for human enhancement rather than distraction.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=69fb46013816"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/5-reasons-why-ar-glasses-are-inevitable-69fb46013816"">5 Reasons why AR glasses are inevitable</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>AI doesn’t just reflect human bias. It amplifies it through everyday use, quietly shaping judgement, trust, and decisions.</h4><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a person from behind, holding a pen thoughtfully while reviewing two stacks of CVs on a wooden desk.

It disagrees with your gut feeling about one applicant. You pause. Reconsider. A few screens later, it disagrees again. You change your mind once more. By the end of the session, you’ve deferred to its judgment on nearly a third of the decisions where you initially felt confident.</p><p>Now swap the algorithm for a colleague. Same stack, same disagreements. How often do you actually budge? Much less often, as it turns out.</p><p>This isn’t hypothetical hand-wringing. <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-02077-2"">Recent research</a> involving 1,401 participants found that <strong>when people disagree with AI, they change their minds 32% of the time. With other humans, that figure drops to 11%.</strong> That’s almost three times more influence from a machine than from another person. Quite something, given we’ve spent millennia learning to be sceptical of each other.</p><p>We like to think of ourselves as rational decision-makers who simply use these tools as helpful aids. The evidence tells a different story. They do more than support our thinking; they reshape it. And far more powerfully than human opinions ever could.</p><p>This raises a question that should keep designers up at night: if users are this susceptible to algorithmic persuasion, what happens when the model itself is biased?</p><p>The answer isn’t just that users make biased choices. The effect compounds. Through repeated interactions, small errors snowball into meaningful distortions. And in most cases, users never notice it happening.</p><figure><img alt=""An infographic showing two stacks of CVs: a tall stack labelled “AI Recommended” and a shorter stack labelled “Your Gut Feeling.” An arrow shows 32% of decisions shifting toward the AI pile.

The problem isn’t one-sided. It’s a two-way street, with both the AI and the human feeding into a loop that amplifies bias at every turn.</p><p>On the AI side, these systems don’t simply reflect the patterns in their training data. They tend to exaggerate them. Machine learning models are optimised to detect and reinforce patterns, which means subtle skews in the data often become stronger in the output.</p><p>A hiring algorithm trained on historical data where 70% of successful hires were men doesn’t just reproduce that 70/30 split. It learns to weight male candidates more heavily, nudging the bias further along. The system is simply doing what it was built to do: find patterns and double down on them.</p><p>But that’s only half of the picture.</p><h3>The human half of the equation</h3><p>We don’t treat AI recommendations the same way we treat advice from another person. We tend to see automated systems as more objective, more analytical. Somehow immune to the messy biases that plague human thinking. This perception gets reinforced by how AI is marketed (“trained on the sum of human knowledge”) and by our long-standing trust in technology for high-stakes decisions in healthcare and finance.</p><p><a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-02077-2"">Research from University College London and MIT</a> shows just how potent this combination can be. Across a series of experiments, participants interpreted facial expressions, motion perception, and other people’s performance. In each case, they interacted with AI systems that had been deliberately programmed with biases similar to those found in many real-world models.</p><p><strong>What happened next wasn’t just a momentary nudge.</strong> The distortion deepened. Through repeated interaction, small initial errors grew into significant skews. Participants who started with relatively minor biases ended up with significantly stronger ones. Largely because the AI amplified existing patterns while participants remained unusually receptive to its guidance.</p><p>Here’s where it gets uncomfortable: most participants had no idea how much the AI was shaping their judgement. When researchers told participants they were interacting with another person (while secretly using a machine), the effect weakened. Simply believing the source was human reduced how deeply the bias took hold.</p><figure><img alt=""Three-phase diagram showing bias persistence. Phase 1: Human and AI robot making decisions together, producing a skewed pattern of outputs. Phase 2: AI is removed, human continues working alone. Phase 3: Human alone still making the same skewed decisions, with a “bias stuck” label and a broken gear icon indicating the pattern has transferred to the human even without the AI present."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*I7183KuMBJ1-HEdXNNmGnQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p>Awareness mattered, but not in the way we might expect. Knowing that the advice came from an algorithm made people <em>more</em> susceptible, not less. <strong>We expect AI to be right, so we lower our guard.</strong> It’s the automation equivalent of assuming the smoke alarm would have gone off if there were a real fire.</p><p>Even more troubling: this effect doesn’t vanish when the AI does. <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-42384-8"">A 2023 study</a> had participants assess medical images (specifically, deciding whether skin spots were benign or potentially cancerous) using a deliberately biased algorithm.</p><p>When the system was removed, the bias stuck around. People continued making the same skewed calls on their own, having unconsciously absorbed its patterns into their decision-making. The higher someone’s self-reported trust in automation, the more their independent conclusions mimicked the machine’s errors.</p><h3>The path of least resistance</h3><p>Our vulnerability to AI isn’t just about trust in technology. It’s rooted in something rather unflattering about how our brains handle effort.</p><p><strong>Psychologists call this the <em>cognitive miser</em> effect. </strong>Thinking is expensive (metabolically, emotionally, and in terms of time) so when we’re handed an opportunity to reduce mental effort, we tend to grab it. These systems offer a particularly seductive shortcut: offloading complex judgement to something that appears faster, smarter, and more thorough than we could manage ourselves.</p><p>This helps explain why automation bias shows up so consistently. <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3240751/"">Studies show</a> that when people work with automated decision-support systems, they dial back their own monitoring and verification. <strong>The presence of AI doesn’t just influence decisions; it quietly changes how much effort we put into thinking at all.</strong></p><p>We see the recommendation, and it feels complete. The work appears to be done. On to the next thing.</p><figure><img alt=""Split illustration comparing cognitive load.

We also tend to believe that these tools have analytical abilities that surpass our own. In some domains, that belief is justified. They can crunch enormous datasets, spot patterns at scale, and perform calculations far beyond human capability.</p><p>The problem is that we extend this assumption into contexts where it doesn’t hold.</p><p>The fact that an algorithm can analyse thousands of medical images doesn’t mean its assessment about an individual patient is infallible. Just because a system can process every CV in a database doesn’t mean it grasps what makes a good hire in a specific team. The leap from “impressive at scale” to “trustworthy in specifics” is one we make far too readily.</p><h3>When trust spirals</h3><p><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3240751/"">The evidence on automation bias</a> shows that inexperience and low confidence amplify this effect. When people feel uncertain about their own abilities, or when they’re working under time pressure, they’re more likely to defer to the machine.</p><p>This creates a rather unhelpful loop. <strong>The more we rely on AI, the less we exercise our own judgement. The less confident we become, the more we rely on it.</strong> Keep that cycle spinning long enough, and your decision-making instincts start to gather dust.</p><p>Branding matters too. Studies have found that when users are told they’re working with an “expert system” rather than a basic algorithm, they’re more likely to follow its recommendations — even when those recommendations are wrong. How we label AI directly shapes how much trust users place in it.</p><p>There’s also what researchers call <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation_bias"">“learned carelessness”</a>. When these systems perform well over time, users gradually reduce their vigilance. High reliability leads to complacency. If the system has been right 95% of the time, we stop checking as carefully. And when it stumbles on that remaining 5%, we’re rarely prepared.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram of a downward spiral with four stages: “Defer to AI” at the top, followed by “Practice Own Judgement Less”, then “Confidence in Own Ability Drops”, and finally “Defer to AI Even More.” The spiral tightens and darkens as it descends into a vortex."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dUJ8BO0UjkYFStYuUgdqOA.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><h3>More than the sum of its parts</h3><p>For a long time, AI bias and human bias have been treated as separate problems with separate fixes. We try to clean up training data and fine-tune models. We train users to recognise their own blind spots and think more critically. Both approaches matter, but they miss something essential. What emerges from human–AI interaction isn’t simply one plus the other. It’s compound bias. Something new that arises specifically from the interplay between the two.</p><p>Think of it less like an equation and more like a chemical reaction. When certain elements combine, they don’t just sit alongside one another. They interact, producing something neither had before they met.</p><p><a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2504.18759v1"">A recent paper</a> makes exactly this argument. <strong>Bias doesn’t live solely in the model or in the user. It emerges dynamically through feedback loops that evolve over time, each party making the other a little worse with every exchange.</strong></p><p>Medical AI studies illustrate this clearly. In a <a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2511.14591v2"">2025 study</a>, researchers examined what happens when class imbalance in AI systems meets human base rate neglect.</p><p>Class imbalance is a technical bias where rare conditions are underrepresented in training data. Base rate neglect is a human cognitive bias where we struggle to reason accurately about low-probability events. Individually, each causes predictable problems.</p><p>Together, they produce something worse.</p><p><strong>Class imbalance throws off people’s ability to gauge how much they should trust the AI. Base rate neglect makes users more vulnerable to skewed outputs.</strong> Each bias reinforces the other, creating feedback loops that lead to poorer outcomes than either would cause alone.</p><p>The errors don’t add up. They multiply.</p><h3>Fixing the wrong problem</h3><p>This is why traditional debiasing strategies often fall short. You can scrub training data and tune algorithms all you like. But if the interaction pattern itself amplifies bias, you haven’t solved the problem. You’ve just trimmed one input to a system that compounds errors regardless.</p><p>The same goes for human-focused interventions. <strong>Teaching users about cognitive bias is valuable, but if the interface encourages offloading and discourages verification, that knowledge stays theoretical.</strong> Filed under “good to know” and rarely retrieved.</p><p>The question shifts. It’s not “is the AI biased?” Or even “are the users biased?” Instead, it goes: “does this interaction create bias amplification over time?”</p><p>That’s a fundamentally different design challenge.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WTzPaQG-Fs7yjFKMekYRLg.png"" /><figcaption>Image based on Caravaggio’s Narcissus (1597–1599)</figcaption></figure><h3>Mirror, mirror in the interface</h3><p>AI doesn’t just mirror our biases. It amplifies them. Quietly, incrementally, and often invisibly. The problem isn’t confined to training data or human psychology alone. It lives in the space between humans and machines, shaped by how each influences the other over repeated interaction.</p><p>For designers, this reframes what we’re solving for. We can’t simply debias algorithms and dust off our hands. We can’t rely solely on user education. <strong>The bias emerges from the interaction itself. From patterns of trust, deference, and cognitive offloading that compound with every exchange.</strong></p><p>Which brings us to the real question.</p><p>If this amplification happens through everyday interactions with AI, where is it already showing up most strongly in the products we use today?</p><p>The research points to a particular type of interface. One that feels natural, helpful, and conversational. In these interactions, users don’t just follow biased recommendations. They begin to internalise them, carrying those biases forward even after the interaction ends.</p><p>And that’s precisely what makes it so hard to see.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Thanks for reading! 📖</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote><em>If you liked this post, </em><a href=""https://medium.com/@doracee""><em>follow me on Medium</em></a><em> for more.</em></blockquote><h3>References &amp; Credits</h3><p>Glickman, M., &amp; Sharot, T.

<p>Exploring navigation as something bigger than moving through physical and digital spaces — as a fundamental cognitive act</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*X6jNJk6M9uS348ftxZqXGQ.png"" /><figcaption>Shipping the package that’s yourself (Image generated using Procreate and Nanobanana)</figcaption></figure><p>A few weeks ago, I read an article — <a href=""https://www.doc.cc/articles/ai-navigation"">A new navigation paradigm</a> — that felt relatable, yet unsettling in a way I couldn’t fully articulate. I eventually stopped thinking about it, but the ideas lingered in the background. They then surfaced in the most mundane and seemingly unrelated places.</p><p>A few weeks later, as I struggled to submit a loan application online, I realized that my frustration stemmed from more than a technical problem. I had lost the ability to <em>navigate </em>the system.</p><p>Shortly after, while taking an Uber ride to a friend’s place, I caught myself in a moment of reflection. I was moving in the physical space with no attention to my surroundings, completely at the mercy of the driver, who was in turn following the instructions from his phone.</p><p>The kind of navigation I was doing in an Uber didn’t seem all that different from my attempts to navigate the banking system. Navigation suddenly felt bigger — like a fundamental cognitive act.</p><p>In this essay, I examine <strong>navigation in four different realms: institutional, physical, digital, and semantic</strong>. By exploring the commonalities, I hope to convey what’s at stake when we eliminate the <em>friction</em> of navigation, and how to deliberately regain some of it.</p><h3>Navigating the system</h3><p>I am currently attempting to fund a home loan through a major Indian bank that is committed to the idea of a “digital-first” India. As a sign of this commitment, they are now “digital-only” — they now process home loan applications online exclusively, or so I’m told. But the portal is a never-ending obstacle course, almost as if designed to test the user’s patience and persistence. It succeeds phenomenally.</p><p>I’m prompted for identification proofs as PDFs under 1MB or JPEGs under 5MB, but when I provide them, I get an error: <em>“Oops! Something went wrong.”</em> Of course, many things could go wrong. Underneath the digital interfaces is the cross-continent network that makes them all tick — the hundreds of hardware devices the data has to traverse, the tens of thousands of miles of wire crossing land and oceans. Distributed systems are built assuming ephemeral failures. But when they happen consistently, it signals something systemic.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*caGp-0y1osvEHv4av2lxqg.png"" /><figcaption>“Oops! Something went wrong.” Error while submitting documents on a banking portal</figcaption></figure><p>You know the problem is prevalent when it becomes material for comedy. Biswas Kalyan Rath, an Indian stand-up comedian, <a href=""https://youtu.be/PK_zuAuI9x0?si=szB908spPScog_k6&amp;t=64"">has a good bit about the state of “digital-first” marriage registration in India</a>.</p><blockquote>“Marriage, no problem. Very simple. Getting marriage registered.. Big problem. It was always a problem, now there is the illusion of Digital India. There is a website. You can go and register. No problem. Fill the entire form. The “Submit” button does not work.”</blockquote><p>I cracked up when I watched it. I’m not laughing now. I’m three weeks into the loan application, and I need it approved.</p><p>The deeper problem isn’t the bad website. It’s what it does to its users. I understand technology, but the bank’s application is a black box to me. The loan agent is an expert in the process but has proven useless. He’s as much a spectator in this as I am. I’m not merely dependent on the website; I’m trapped between technology that’s not done well and a human who doesn’t understand it well. We’ve both lost the ability to <em>navigate</em> the system.</p><h3>Navigating the physical world</h3><p>During my childhood, when I traveled by bus to my maternal hometown — Ichalkaranji, Maharashtra’s textile hub — we could tell we had arrived by the pungent smell and rhythmic din of the cotton mills. We could tell the time remaining by the landmarks we passed — the restaurants, the trees, the market, the temples, the stadium. Knowing a destination meant knowing its spatial signature. We had to read the surroundings to know when we had arrived. Navigation was an act of observation. Even the act of describing a destination meant being deeply aware of its characteristics. We saw a place as a point in space, situated relative to other places.</p><p>Then came paper maps, which provided a way to abstract the physical reality and capture its essence in symbols. It was a leap forward, but still required us to compare the map against the territory — active interpretation. The map acted as external memory. The processing still happened in your brain. In software terms, this was the separation of storage and compute. The maps only told you the layout. You had to orient yourself against it.</p><p>Then Google Maps outsourced “compute” too.</p><p>It wasn’t just paper maps on a screen. It offered a fundamentally different technology: <em>active navigation</em>. Active interpretation on the user’s part gave way to the step-by-step guidance from the software. It not only knew the landscape; it knew your place in it. You just had to trust it. Spatial navigation became a skill you no longer needed. When Google Maps tells me to “take the next exit and stay on the second to the right lane”, I mindlessly execute.</p><p>What navigation demands from me now is not intelligence but compliance.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2hg4yjIZHevidm3IrPtAhw.png"" /><figcaption>Navigating by compliance (Image generated using Procreate and Nanobanana)</figcaption></figure><p>I’m as much a victim as a culprit of this de-skilling that has happened at scale. Due to my overreliance on technology, I don’t remember the street names in my neighborhood anymore, despite having lived in the same place for over two years. It speaks to how little I pay attention to the world around me when the blue arrow and the friendly voice are leading the way.</p><p><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7156656/"">A 2020 longitudinal study</a> tracked regular drivers over three years and found that people with greater lifetime GPS experience demonstrated reduced spatial memory during self-guided navigation. It found not just correlation, but causality of GPS use leading to decline in spatial memory.</p><h3>Getting carried away</h3><p>Compare this to the Uber model.</p><p>You set the destination, a driver accepts, you accept, and off you go. One of the “benefits” of Uber is that it relieves you of the mundane act of driving. Your attentional resources, the logic goes, can be better spent on “more important” needs — like scrolling social media on your phone instead of greeting the human three feet away. Thanks to self-driving cars, we’ve even eliminated that guilt, if there ever was.</p><p>Somewhere in that scroll, you lose track of time, of the route, of your environment. You’re physically there, but mentally elsewhere. The only active role you’ve played is scheduling the pick-up and the drop-off. You’ve shipped the package that is yourself.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*k0y481sV4ABUh7-lWm-1RA.png"" /><figcaption>Uber pickup and drop-off</figcaption></figure><h3>Navigating the digital world</h3><p>Consider a typical day using digital interfaces. You log in to your computer or your phone, you find the application you need, navigate through its menus and screens, do what you want to do, close it, move on to the next app. It’s essentially an endless loop of navigation until you log off and go back to the real world.</p><p>This is akin to navigation in the pre-GPS world. There is a certain map of the world — the software’s user interface — and you have to learn it. You “onboard” yourself, and navigate it by paying attention. You are spatially aware of the world that the software has created for you. You know what capabilities it has, or where and how to find them.</p><p>We are increasingly moving towards an intent-based navigation system, or as I think of it, “Uber-ification” of the digital world. Intent-based software comes in two flavors: search-first, and AI-first.</p><p>In search-first applications, you search for keywords, say, “expense report” and it’ll show you potential actions like “View your expense reports” or “File a new expense report”. You select the one you want without knowing where it lives in the application. The geography doesn’t matter.</p><p>In AI-first applications, it’s even more extreme. You declare the intent — “File my expenses” — and the agent handles the rest. You’ve achieved your goal without ever knowing where the expense module is housed in the software, or even how to even file one yourself.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/727/1*Z3AwXnIZWn1Ceh_Qq9795Q.png"" /><figcaption>Intent-driven: Search-first</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/743/1*0Z9bFsL-7NjcpvzCWKIg1Q.png"" /><figcaption>Intent-driven: AI-first</figcaption></figure><p>There’s a plethora of intent-based software now, with AI embedded in them, eager to translate your intent into outcomes. Traditional navigation is gradually converging into a ubiquitous conversational interface.</p><p>Notion AI promises to write your docs for you. Cursor and Claude promise to write your code. Glean <a href=""https://outofdesk.blog/blog/performance-reviews-llms"">writes your performance reviews</a> — the very document that requires sitting with the uncomfortable and hard work of assessing your own year, your team’s contributions, their strengths and weaknesses in your own words.

No reflection required</figcaption></figure><p>Each of these <em>smart</em> apps makes you more productive. No navigation required. No blank page to face. No empty file with a cursor blinking. Information architecture — the design of where things live and how they connect — no longer matters. Not to you, at least. The agent navigates for you.</p><h3>Beyond movement: Navigation as a metacognitive skill</h3><p>Consider what happens when you navigate without GPS in an unfamiliar city. You <strong>assess</strong> your current location, <strong>identify</strong> your destination, <strong>survey</strong> available information — landmarks, street signs, smell, sounds, <strong>hypothesize</strong> about which direction to go, <strong>make decisions</strong> with incomplete information, <strong>monitor</strong> feedback as you move, <strong>adjust</strong>, when you encounter obstacles, wrong turns, or dead ends, and <strong>learn</strong> from the experience, building a richer understanding of the territory.</p><p>Now consider what you do when you’re trying to understand a topic, say, climate change. You <strong>assess</strong> what you currently know or understand, <strong>identify</strong> what you need to know, <strong>survey</strong> available information — documentation, courses, articles, real world case-studies, papers, mental models, <strong>hypothesize</strong> about how it might work, <strong>make decisions</strong> about which path to explore first with incomplete information, <strong>monitor</strong> feedback as you learn, <strong>adjust</strong> your mental model when you hit obstacles, and <strong>learn</strong>, building a richer, more accurate understanding of the system.</p><p>Problem-solving is navigation. Learning is navigation. Decision-making is navigation. You’re moving through space — either real or conceptual — through uncertainty, towards clarity, understanding, destination, or outcomes.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*d711JP8zbOaFo9j4j8lQUQ.png"" /><figcaption>Navigating to clarity (Image generated using Procreate and Nanobanana)</figcaption></figure><p>This isn’t a metaphor. <a href=""https://iiif.library.cmu.edu/file/Simon_box00065_fld05031_bdl0001_doc0001/Simon_box00065_fld05031_bdl0001_doc0001.pdf"">Herbert Simon’s work</a> describes problem-solving as “search through a problem-space.” <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5248972/"">Neuroscience has also shown that the same neural systems(the hippocampus, place, and grid cells)</a> support both physical and conceptual navigation. What makes something navigation isn’t whether it moves through a physical space, but rather that it requires relational mapping, position assessment, route planning, and dynamic reorganization.</p><p>So we are navigating pretty much all the time. And it’s becoming easier with technology. So what?</p><p>Just as GPS use causes a measurable decline in our spatial memory, AI tools that navigate conceptual spaces for us pose the same risk in a different, arguably more critical, domain.</p><h3>The Pharmakon and the problem with frictionless</h3><p>Looking at technological innovations through the lens of <a href=""https://aeon.co/essays/bernard-stieglers-philosophy-on-how-technology-shapes-our-world""><em>pharmakon</em></a> — both remedy and poison — remedies are clearly visible: speed, efficiency, productivity, convenience. Even when they’re not, organizations are happy to sell us on them.</p><p>The poisons are more subtle: dependency, agency, losing the cognitive friction that maintains our capacity to navigate. The agent absorbs the cost of navigation, but it also becomes the locus of agency.</p><p>Two risks that stand out, and are worth thinking about:</p><p><strong>The transfer of agency</strong>: By shifting the agency of navigation to the software, you end up being at the mercy of the navigator. <a href=""https://outofdesk.blog/performance-reviews-llms"">If the AI routes you, you stop thinking about alternatives.</a> The convenience is paid for with a little bit of your money and a lot more of your agency. With the erasure of navigation, Information Architecture gives way to Choice Architecture.</p><p>This might be fine for filing tax returns. Humanity would benefit from spending less time doing that. But what happens when the same happens with critical thinking? Comprehension? Reflection? Decision-making?</p><p><strong>The vacuum of attention</strong>: With the time and attention you’ve regained from not navigating, you need something meaningful to do. Few people know what to do with that kind of freedom. They look to technology to fill the void. But the incentives of technology companies, more often than not, don’t align with the well-being of the user, especially when the way to make money and user interests are at odds.</p><p>When you’re not navigating and also not driving, there’s the promise of reflecting, reading, thinking, writing, or building. But first, why not catch up on what your friends are doing? Or the Kardashians? Or millions of strangers?</p><p>It presents a dark irony: We save time by delegating things to technology, only to pour that time back into it, mindlessly scrolling.</p><h3>Solutions: For victims and culprits</h3><p>I want to think about solutions to this problem, both as a victim — a consumer and a <em>navigator</em> — and a culprit — someone who builds technology products, and <em>designs </em>navigation.</p><p>I say culprits not because they have bad intentions, but likely because they either lack any or they are acting on misaligned incentives.</p><h3>Micro-frictions as the antidote for the victim</h3><p>I’m learning to be more intentional about what friction I want to eliminate and what I want to preserve. About what navigation I want to do myself versus delegate.</p><p>I use AI every day. It has largely empowered me. But I’m deliberate in its use.</p><p>I resist the temptation to start with AI-generated drafts because the value of writing lies in the struggle to articulate the original thought. It’s that struggle that clarifies what you want to say, what you want to achieve. Only then do I use AI. My process isn’t simply sequential, so the handoff isn’t a clear line. It’s a feedback loop. But the bulk of my effort goes into the pre-AI phase, ensuring that I build a vision for the artifact that I want to produce — whether it’s an essay or software. I can then direct it rather than being led by it.</p><p>For places I visit regularly, I’ve stopped using maps. I’m rebuilding the habit of paying attention to my surroundings.</p><p>I keep my phone away when I’m with my kids, both to be present with them and implicitly teach them the value of paying attention. I find pockets of time severed from technology — sipping coffee, going on walks — which builds the habit of being comfortable alone with my thoughts.</p><p>How is this all related to navigation, you say? Intentionality brings clarity, which in turn helps you navigate effectively.</p><p>If you want to read more about this idea of introducing friction, this article from The Cut captures it well: <a href=""https://www.thecut.com/article/brooding-friction-maxxing-new-years-2026-resolution.html""><em>In 2026, We Are Friction-Maxxing</em></a>.</p><h3>Design principles for technologists as culprits</h3><p>This might sound obvious, but when designing technology products, it helps to keep users’ needs <em>and well-being</em> in mind.</p><p><strong>Build robust fallback mechanisms:</strong> In the banking portal, when the “digital-only” system failed, neither the customer nor the employee could navigate an alternative path. The system had eliminated all other routes.</p><p>Before implementing AI assistance or intent-based shortcuts, think about whether the user can complete the task if the feature breaks or is unavailable. Build fallback mechanisms that allow manual navigation when automated paths fail, surface error states that help users understand what went wrong, provide enough context for users to troubleshoot independently, and maintain alternative paths to the same destination.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tGOrUoGbx8Q4_Dqgx6_wrw.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/9356221-deploy-fin-ai-agent-over-email"">Fin agent fallback</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Distinguish between transactional and developmental tasks:</strong> When developing automations, distinguish between <strong>transactional tasks</strong> (filing taxes, scheduling meetings, data entry) and <strong>developmental tasks</strong> (writing, learning, problem-solving, decision-making). This is similar to the idea of distinguishing between <a href=""https://outofdesk.blog/thinking-outside-the-doc"">competitive artifacts and complementary artifacts</a>.</p><p>Transactional tasks should be frictionless. These are tasks where efficiency is the primary goal, and there’s little value in the process itself. But developmental tasks benefit from <a href=""https://every.to/thesis/in-the-ai-age-making-things-difficult-is-deliberate"">good friction</a>. The process of navigating uncertainty is often where the real value lies.</p><p><a href=""https://danielmiessler.com/blog/keep-the-robots-out-of-the-gym"">“Gym skills”</a> is a good metaphor. For developmental tasks, consider AI as a collaborator that augments rather than replaces the user’s cognitive work. <a href=""https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/blog/the-importance-of-friction-in-ai-systems/"">Speculative and Critical Design (SCD)</a> framework lays out one of the most articulate ways to think about this.</p><p><strong>Adjust assistance based on expertise:</strong> Design systems that adjust assistance levels based on user expertise, because effective delegation requires good judgment on the user’s part.</p><p>Beginners benefit from more guidance, explanations, and visible structure to help them build mental models of the system. Intermediate users can make effective use of shortcuts and intent-based features, but in a way that traditional navigation is visible and accessible. Expert users demand customizability, creating their own navigation paths, or even disabling assistance they don’t need.</p><p>The problem with many AI-first products is that they apply the same level of automation to everyone, preventing users from ever developing expertise. A newly minted manager using AI to completely delegate the work of crafting performance reviews for the team, for example, isn’t going to build the muscle of reflecting on the relationships with people, paying attention to their motivations, strengths, and weaknesses.</p><p><strong>Preserve visible structure:</strong> Even with search-first or AI-first interfaces, users benefit from understanding the underlying structure. Consider <strong>visual sitemaps or navigation breadcrumbs</strong> that show users where they are in the system, <strong>contextual hints</strong> about where information lives, even when delivering it through search, and <strong>progressive disclosure</strong> that reveals structure as users engage more deeply with the product.</p><p><a href=""https://www.aiuxdesign.guide/"">aiuxdesign.guide</a> has a comprehensive set of design patterns that mention some of these and more, with real-world examples.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>There are a few pockets of life that haven’t been taken over by assistive and active technology. Building the muscle to tolerate (and design) good friction and (help) reclaiming the ownership of your attention are good starts to prepare for what’s ahead. There’s little I can do to navigate the banking system. But there are other areas I can exercise control, both as a creator and a consumer.</p><p><em>Find me on </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ggauravr/""><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em>, </em><a href=""https://x.com/outofdesk""><em>X</em></a><em>, or check out my </em><a href=""https://outofdesk.blog/""><em>blog here</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3>Inspirations and references</h3><ul><li><a href=""https://www.doc.cc/articles/ai-navigation"">DOC • A new navigation paradigm</a></li><li><a href=""https://signalpath.substack.com/p/do-ai-products-even-need-navigation"">Do AI Products Even Need Navigation? — by Andrew Sims</a></li><li><a href=""https://aeon.co/essays/bernard-stieglers-philosophy-on-how-technology-shapes-our-world"">Bernard Stiegler’s philosophy on how technology shapes our world | Aeon Essays</a></li><li><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7156656/"">Habitual use of GPS negatively impacts spatial memory during self-guided navigation — PMC</a></li><li><a href=""https://youtu.be/PK_zuAuI9x0?si=szB908spPScog_k6&amp;t=64"">Biswa Kalyan Rath | Birth Proof | Stand Up Comedy</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.thecut.com/article/brooding-friction-maxxing-new-years-2026-resolution.html"">In 2026, We Are Friction-Maxxing</a></li><li><a href=""https://iiif.library.cmu.edu/file/Simon_box00065_fld05031_bdl0001_doc0001/Simon_box00065_fld05031_bdl0001_doc0001.pdf"">THE THEORY OF PROBLEM SOLVING</a></li><li><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5248972/"">Organizing Conceptual Knowledge in Humans with a Grid-like Code — PMC</a></li><li><a href=""https://asana.com/ai-principles"">Asana — Our principles for helping humanity thrive with AI</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.psychoftech.org/blog/2020/3/10/cognitive-artifacts"">Cognitive Artifacts — Psychology of Technology Institute</a></li><li><a href=""https://every.to/thesis/in-the-ai-age-making-things-difficult-is-deliberate"">In the AI Age, Making Things Difficult Is Deliberate | Every</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.notion.com/blog/the-design-thinking-behind-notion-ai"">The Thinking Behind Notion AI</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/blog/the-importance-of-friction-in-ai-systems/"">The Importance of Fricton in AI Systems | Mozilla Foundation</a></li><li><a href=""https://hbr.org/2022/06/why-ai-customer-journeys-need-more-friction"">Why AI Customer Journeys Need More Friction | HBR</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.aiuxdesign.guide/"">AI UX Design Patterns</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=f6c63585f7af"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/getting-carried-away-when-intelligence-is-replaced-by-compliance-f6c63585f7af"">Getting carried away: When intelligence is replaced by compliance</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<p><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/10/11938298/bridgerton-season-4-details-cast-love-story-characters"">Bridgerton’s</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/10/11938298/bridgerton-season-4-details-cast-love-story-characters""> Yerin Ha</a> is currently <em>everywhere</em>. While we have been fans of the Korean-Australian actor since <em>Halo</em> and <em>Bad Behaviour</em>, her breakout role in <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/10/11938163/bridgerton-season-4-details-cast-love-story-characters"">Bridgerton</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/10/11938163/bridgerton-season-4-details-cast-love-story-characters""> Season 4</a> as Sophie Baek has put her on the map worldwide. As the first <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2022/03/10896653/asian-australian-women-online-communities"">East Asian</a> to lead the Regency romance drama, she continues to break boundaries and offer representation for those less seen on screen.</p>



<p>As a rising star, Ha has also been hand-picked by SAG-AFTRA to become the Ambassador for <a href=""https://www.actorawards.org/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Actor Awards</a>, which will air live on March 2. The star will be sharing behind-the-scenes content and participating in multiple pre-show events.</p>



<p>“Being named The Actor Awards Ambassador is such an honor because this ceremony is about actors celebrating actors,” Ha said. “There is something uniquely powerful about being recognised within your own community. As someone who cares so deeply about the craft and about collaboration, it means so much to represent the next generation of actors and be part of an event that uplifts storytelling.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>There is something uniquely powerful about being recognised within your own community.</p><cite>Yerin Ha</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Ha follows in the footsteps of previous SAG-AFTRA Ambassadors such as Sofia Carson, Haley Lu Richardson, Antonia Gentry and Alexandra Daddario.</p>



<p>The <em>Bridgerton </em>star was most recently seen at Gold House’s Lunar New Year party, where <a href=""https://people.com/bridgerton-yerin-ha-says-former-leads-simone-ashley-and-nicola-coughlan-have-been-lovely-and-supportive-exclusive-11681027"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">she opened up to </a><em><a href=""https://people.com/bridgerton-yerin-ha-says-former-leads-simone-ashley-and-nicola-coughlan-have-been-lovely-and-supportive-exclusive-11681027"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">People</a></em> about East-Asian representation on screen. “It’s been really, really amazing and beautiful. I mean, I’ve been really caught up with the [<em>Bridgerton</em>] press tour, so I don’t think I’ve been too [online], Ha said. “It has been really positive and I just feel so proud that I get to be the face of that and keep advocating for change, and knowing that we deserve these roles and spaces.”</p>



<p><em>Bridgerton</em> Season 4 Part 2 will be released on February 26, and will see Ha’s Sophie (hopefully) win Benedict’s heart and become a true leading lady. In a time where the world can seem overwhelming, it’s lovely to be able to celebrate Ha and her successes.</p>

<p>My feed has been completely taken over by fans lamenting that they haven’t been able to secure <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/05/9781230/hilary-duff-kids-luca-banks-mom-advice-media"">Hilary Duff</a> tickets for <a href=""https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a70327671/how-to-buy-hilary-duff-the-lucky-me-tour-tickets/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Lucky Me Tour</a>. From people sliding into the pop star’s DMs to beg her to add more dates, to countless memes and TikToks from those who missed out, it’s clear that <a href=""https://lifestyle.si.com/news/hilary-duff-pens-love-letter-to-fans-following-new-album-release"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hilary Duff fever</a> has landed. During the first Mastercard pre-sale in Australia where I live, there were over 50,000 fans in the queue. Aside from the fact that Duff hasn’t toured here for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/ipod-noughties-tech-nostalgia"">18 years</a>, the demand could tie into this interesting trend of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/gen-z-nostalgia-millennial-experience"">pop culture selling nostalgia</a> — a sure-fire way to tap into already established audiences. </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/apr/28/that-yearning-feeling-why-we-need-nostalgia"">According to psychologists</a>, nostalgia is a powerful tool. It has the ability to increase self-esteem, help people form social bonds, soothe anxiety, boredom and stress, as well as being positive for your mental health. One fan tells me a <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15562273/Hilary-Duff-tour-fans-engaged-las-vegas.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">connection with Hilary Duff</a> transports her back to when times felt safer and easier. “They weren’t lying when they said ‘don’t grow up’. I was really lucky growing up, I had a beautiful childhood, with a big family, everything was simple back then and the world felt beautiful and full of colour,” fan Sakara Bell says. “I’ll never forget the Christmas when I unwrapped her album <em>Most Wanted</em>. I played <em>Beat Of My Heart </em>on repeat for months and never got tired of it.”</p>



<p>Anita Tran, who was lucky enough to purchase tickets, says nostalgia is “powerful” right now. “It transports me back to when my biggest worry was whether I’d make it back home in time to watch my favourite Disney Channel shows. A time where my first crush was <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7530306456667622687"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chad Michael Murray</a> in <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/01/10259591/one-tree-hill-james-lafferty-now-engaged-career"">One Tree Hill</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/01/10259591/one-tree-hill-james-lafferty-now-engaged-career""> </a>or I first understood what love meant watching <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2021/09/10678647/best-2000s-tv-shows-teens"">Dawson’s Creek</a></em>. It’s sweet, it’s innocent, and it’s just safe,” Tran adds. “Hilary is my childhood. <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"">She takes me back to my youth, where a cartoon <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lizzie-mcguire-hair-makeup"">Lizzie McGuire</a> </em>narrated my exact teenage thoughts, and <em>Metamorphosis </em>was the album my besties and I blasted on the way home from school</span>.” Other fans echoed the same sentiment, with one wanting to “heal her inner teen”, and another says Duff “genuinely influenced her personality as a child”. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Being able to experience something that is your childhood, is everything and more.</p><cite>Sakara Bell, Hilary Duff Fan</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Duff’s triumphant return to pop music is not only a reclaiming of her story, and finally being able to write the music <em>she always wanted to write</em>, but it ties into a larger theme of how we’re seeing the world. The <a href=""https://dictionary.apa.org/nostalgia"">definition of nostalgia</a> is wanting to return to a time of life where things seemed better than the present, and with the current political climate, consumers are more desperate for nostalgia than ever. With an ongoing <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/palestine-mothers-children-gaza-solidarity"">genocide in Gaza</a>, <a href=""https://psychology.org.au/insights/the-australian-women-dreading-change-in-trump%E2%80%99s-am"">Trump rolling back women’s rights</a>, and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2026/02/11959006/celebrity-political-statements-grammys-super-bowl"">issues of ICE in the USA</a>, it seems almost impossible to go through life without being faced with a new horrific truth. Shared nostalgia gives us an escape, where we can come together and bond as a community. </p>



<p>It’s no surprise that brands have commodified nostalgia. If you were wondering why there have been endless amounts of reboots (did we <em>really</em> need <em>Zoey 102</em>?), and beloved childhood toys like <em>Barbie</em> getting the big-screen treatment, there’s a reason. <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/41/3/713/2907535"">Research shows</a> that nostalgia can “decrease people’s desire for money”. People are more willing to open their wallets and pay more for products. <em><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/4JlqOqhImVEFmH4ue7GbVH"">Culture Club</a> </em>co-host and writer Jasmine Wallis agrees, believing that while she loves nostalgia, a big part of it is capitalism. “Millenials and older Gen Z’s (like Hilary’s fans) are entering adulthood in a really tough economy. So, while having kids and buying a house feels like a huge struggle and sacrifice, attending concerts like Hilary’s can offer a sense of joy for just $200,” Wallis says. “It takes us back to childhood whilst also offering a reprieve from adulthood. Executives and corporations know this and so are playing into it.” Duff fan Sakara Bell is aware of this marketing tactic, but it doesn’t turn her off at all. “I don’t really care. As cringy as it is, you only live once, and I’m a big believer in money comes and goes,” Bell says. “Being able to experience something that is your childhood, is everything and more.” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>It takes us back to childhood whilst also offering a reprieve from adulthood. Executives and corporations know this and so are playing into it.</p><cite>Jasmine Wallis, co-host and writer of culture club</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Nostalgia isn’t even exclusive to your own childhood, either. <a href=""https://theharrispoll.com/briefs/millennials-lead-american-optimism-for-the-future/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Even Gen Z are tapping into nostalgia</a> for the 1990s, including those who weren’t alive at the time. The pre-digital era is coveted by those who believe we’re spending too long doomscrolling. According to a study in the US, two-thirds of Gen Z adults wished to return to a world before we were all “plugged in”. </p>



<p>Perhaps that’s why Hilary Duff has completely taken over in Australia. It’s about more than just her hits (but she has great bops, to be fair), and more about society and how we yearn for a simpler, kinder time in life. </p>

<p>When I say I’ve watched the rise and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/body-inclusivity-in-fashion-2025"">fall of size inclusion</a> at <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/search?q=nyfw"">New York Fashion Week</a>, I really mean it. <br /><br />I was at the runway of <em>the</em> first plus-size designer on the official NYFW calendar (Eden Miller’s Cabiria, showing at Mercedes Benz Fashion Week back in 2013). A year later, I was there when <a href=""https://www.elle.com/fashion/a45139956/plus-size-new-york-fashion-week/"">Chromat opened their SS15 show with plus model Denise Bidot</a> — and I made a very un-fashion-week-like exclamation of excitement when I saw her step onto the runway. I saw Christian Siriano go from a straight size designer to a plus fashion collab with Lane Bryant, to dressing plus celebrities for the red carpet, to becoming one of the designers known for dressing <em>every</em> body once he normalized <a href=""https://www.glamour.com/story/5-plus-size-models-just-walked-in-christian-sirianos-fashion-show"">including multiple plus models on the runway in 2016</a>.<br /><br />For a glorious while, it felt like progress was inevitable and the number of plus models walking NYFW would just keep going up… and then the pandemic hit. And then <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/body-positivity-movement-fat-black-women-weight-loss"">the rise of Ozempic</a> for weight loss hit. And suddenly, progress hadn’t just ground to a halt — we were going backwards. <br /><br />As someone who has been <a href=""https://www.elle.com/elleextra/events/a46688773/fashioning-a-more-size-inclusive-nyfw-panel-discussion/"">pushing for size inclusion in fashion</a> for over a decade, it is beyond disheartening to see the tiny bit of hard-fought progress we made being pushed back so rapidly. I’ve loved fashion since I was a little kid (I was the 5 year-old seeking out copies of <em>Vogue</em> and <em>Elle</em> at the local library), and I still get a thrill from covering NYFW even after a decade plus of doing so. But sometimes I look at the CFDA calendar before a season starts and feel my anxiety rising, because I just know there probably will be little to no size diversity to come. <br /><br />That bad-gut feeling was sadly correct this season. The official numbers aren’t in yet, but this might have been one of the least size diverse New York Fashion Weeks in recent history — and that bar is <em>low</em>.<br /><br />Now, some of this season’s dip can be attributed to certain brands sitting the season out. Last season, I saw the bulk of visibly plus size representation at plus-specific shows like<a href=""https://www.reneecafaroatelier.com/""> Renee Cafaro Atelier</a> and plus fashion label <a href=""https://www.eloquii.com/"">Eloquii</a>’s NYFW debut. Size inclusive designers like <a href=""https://rachelantonoff.com/"">Rachel Antonoff</a> and Kimberly Gordon of <a href=""https://selkiecollection.com/"">Selkie</a> can always be counted on for truly diverse runways too, but neither showed this season. <a href=""https://www.alexisbittar.com/"">Alexis Bittar</a> is another designer that I always find casts without discriminating against larger bodies (last season’s pageant-themed presentation was filled with dolls of every size), but this year’s visceral, violent, and excellent vignette just included one model (and one victim), so size diversity wasn’t applicable this time around. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p><strong>But all that just highlights the fact that it shouldn’t be on a handful of designers to carry all of the representation at Fashion Week. Because when they change their format or skip a season, the absence is keenly felt. </strong></p><cite>Sarah Chiwaya</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>These feelings are <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/fashion/skinny-models-ozempic-glp1.html"">supported by the data</a>: We’ve not yet seen the numbers from this season, but last season the representation was insignificant, with less than 1% plus models on the runway, and 97.1% of models sizes 0-4. Given that the average U.S. size is closer to a 16/18 (and <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm"">recent CDC data</a> shows that that size is holding true even after years of aggressive marketing of GLP-1s for weight loss), that is nothing short of abysmal. <br /><br />To be clear, we’ve never approached anything even CLOSE to equitable runway representation (which would mean at least 67% curve models). Indeed, we’ve barely even cracked 5% — and that’s with the most generous calculations. Tokenization, which is not real representation, has often been the norm over the last decade, but there’s nothing like seeing <em>zero</em> curves on the runway to put the absence of even that little bit of size diversity into sharp relief. <br /><br />I wasn’t alone in feeling it, either. Bella Gerard, a fashion editor and author of <a href=""https://bellagerard.substack.com/"">Substack’s B List</a>, also noted the blatant regression: “Above all else, the lack of body diversity on the runway this season just feels so…disappointing,” she noted. “It’s not breaking news that attempts at inclusivity are often performative in the fashion sphere, but this season really proved a ‘one step forward, three steps back’ reality. Not only was there next to no curve representation, but the straight size models looked even thinner than in recent years, calling back to an era of thinspo I thought we’d collectively renounced and evolved past.” </p>

<p>Fortunately, there were some bright points this season too, with top designers whose visions of fashion were not constrained to just one type of girl. On the first day of shows, <a href=""https://collinastrada.com/"">Collina Strada</a> showed a deliciously darkly romantic-yet-eclectic collection, replete with high <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/09/11778397/beetlejuice-beetlejuice-fashion-costumes"">Victorian lace collars</a>, blurred prints, volume play, and body baring dropped-waist silk dresses that looked equally hot on straight and plus size models. Later that evening, <a href=""https://www.jane-wade.com/"">Jane Wade</a>’s show — titled “The Summit” — was an innovative fashion expedition, with conifers on the runway, tents on dresses (and <em>as</em> dresses), and survival-ready fabrications merged with Wade’s signature suiting and elevated officewear. (The story of a corporate woman dreaming of an escape to nature is crucially not one limited by size.)<br /><br />And at New York Men’s Day, <a href=""https://www.a-potts.com/"">A.Potts</a> showed a distinctive style of oversized, genderless clothing on a cast that included both age diversity and an even more underrepresented category: Male plus models. Designer Aaron Potts is no stranger to size diverse casting, either: Prior seasons have included plus models, and I — a size 20 — was actually one of the models for the launch of his new diffusion label Werkshop by A.Potts (which was also featured in his NYMD presentation). <br /><br />I allowed myself a little hope after that good first day, but as the week went on and I saw more shows with <em>zero</em> curve models than not, the lack of size inclusion just felt more and more pronounced. Industry friends who knew I was reporting on size inclusion this season would occasionally text me curve model sightings. “Paloma on the runway at Proenza.” “One curve model at Gabe Gordon.” “I think two? at Eckhaus Latta.” Every message was appreciated, but the underlying implication that we needed to be eagle-eyed to spot even a smidgeon of size inclusion was a downer. <br /><br />Then there were the false positives, driven by the emerging trend of adding mass to thin bodies with clothing. I saw countless peplums, panniers, and padded pieces throughout the week, and as I was desperately searching for a hint of curve and trying to parse a tall size 8 curve model from her size 4 contemporary, I occasionally got excited only to realize that was just a straight size model with fabric curves added on. It felt like I was playing an unwitting (and unwelcome) game of “curve model or just a structured hip?” When there’s so little visual difference between straight and curve models — who do not typically wear <em>actual</em> plus sizes, paradoxically — the facade of inclusion shatters even more.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960287.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>Shows with organic diversity, like <a href=""https://kimshui.net/"">Kim Shui</a>’s richly textured, color-forward FW26 show, were some of the bright points of the season, but were sadly the exceptions, not the rule. Age diversity did seem to be on the uptick, too — with gorgeous older models in shows including <a href=""https://www.carolinaherrera.com/us/en/"">Carolina Herrera</a>, <a href=""https://diotima.world/"">Diotima</a>, and the relaunch of <a href=""https://dereklam.com/"">Derek Lam</a> with new creative director Robert Rodriguez at the helm.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p><strong>Yet as I saw runway after runway composed exclusively of the thinnest models, the scattered tips I was getting about curve models on the runway started to feel like rare sightings of an endangered species.</strong> </p><cite>Sarah Chiwaya</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>As someone with 25 seasons of NYFW under my belt and who has dedicated my career to the push for more and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wray-closing-plus-size-community-impact"">better for plus size women</a>, I am always wary when there’s a category that seems like the chosen diversity <em>du jour. </em>True representation should be across the board and not a passing trend, with an ongoing emphasis on making sure underrepresented groups can see themselves in fashion. I’ve obviously clocked this, but other fashion industry vets have noted it as well. <br /><br />In <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/fashion/skinny-models-ozempic-glp1.html"">a recent piece for the <em>New York Times</em></a>, top fashion critic Vanessa Friedman noted that the recent shift extends well beyond the catwalk: “The gravitational pull is toward an ever-shrinking human form, especially on the runway,” she wrote. “It’s too bad. Not because skinniness is bad, but because it should not be the only option. People still come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. Seeing the reality of life reflected on the runways, which have become a form of entertainment for everyone, is actually more appealing than seeing life reduced to one size that cannot fit all.<br /><br />Designers who really understand that appeal also know that it’s good for their bottom line. Committing to size inclusivity isn’t just the ethical thing to do — it’s good business sense, too. Take Christian Siriano, who <a href=""https://www.elle.com/fashion/celebrity-style/a21529009/christian-siriano-tripled-his-business-by-adding-plus-sizes/"">extolled the fiscal virtues of size inclusion back in 2018</a>, saying: “Adding plus sizes to my line tripled my business. Why wouldn’t you do that?!” <br /><br />This season, when asked about diversity in casting, he echoed that sentiment, exclaiming that it was “so important!” Last week, the designer punctuated this belief visually by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DU659FZiSdq/"">sending the same silhouette down the runway on two different body types</a>. “I love how you can see they look amazing in the same dress, in the same look,” he told me backstage. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960215.jpg?width=854&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=427%3A512"" /></figure></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960216.jpg?width=854&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=427%3A512"" /></figure></div>



<p>When designers approach representation as part of their brand identity, it effortlessly translates to the audience. Both legendary R&amp;B singer Monica and <em>the </em>Whoopi Goldberg independently praised Siriano’s commitment to making fashion for all backstage. “It was absolute elegance, and it was for every size, shape, color and creed, so many different types of women — and men! — in the show,” Monica noted. “Gives you all sorts of inspiration!” Goldberg summed it up even more succinctly: “Christian’s work just always inspires me and makes me so happy, because we can all wear it.”<br /><br />That type of organic inclusion was also evident in <a href=""https://chukscollins.com/"">Chuks Collins</a>’s striking presentation, which ranged from lush topstitched knits to sharp suits to stunning structured ballgowns, all shown on a range of sizes and body types. (Collins was heavily influenced by how scarification, purposeful, ritual, and otherwise, can play into the way we present ourselves to the world.)<br /><br />“I grew up seeing people that look like you, people that look like me,” Collins said. “My mom is not a size 2. My grandmother, who taught me to sew, she’s not a size 10. About 40 to 50% of my clients are plus size people. So I am not going to lie to myself and say ‘oh, my demographic, my ideal demographic is a size 2 to 4.’”<br /><br />For Collins, who started the brand in 2006, building a collection for customers of all sizes is both a labor of love and a practical financial matter — after all, he’s building a label he wants to last. “I have to create clothes that people see themselves in, that they want to wear. With that, I’m becoming a successful business,” he noted. “I also just love dressing people with curves, because that’s what I started doing, that’s how I started my career. So I’m not going to — because of what, industry standards? — I’m not going to include that? And I love women. I love beautiful women with curves. I tell the stories of how I feel, and my work is a representation of myself.” <br /><br />In the end, an outsized portion of the size diversity this season came from emerging designers and those making their CFDA debuts, such as Menyelek Rose of the eponymous label <a href=""https://www.menyelek.online/"">Menyelek</a>. Designer <a href=""https://www.andrewcurwen.com/home"">Andrew Curwen</a>, meanwhile, showed a sexy, directional, and haunting (complimentary!) collection. “Nocturnal Conditions” looked stunning on every figure, and the diverse cast (by F10 Casting agency) felt simultaneously natural and intentional. <br /><br />Camryn Mcclain of <a href=""https://reneenyc.com/"">RENÉE NYC</a> also cited body diversity as integral to her inspiration: “For casting this season, we focused on different characters of everyday people of various shapes and sizes that reflect what I see in the city,” Mcclain said. That thoughtfulness complemented a presentation of some of the most interesting knitwear I’ve seen lately, with bold braiding and fringe details rendered in rich jewel tones and gilded neutrals. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960219.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>

<p>“I want my collection to inspire and be inclusive for everyone,” said <a href=""https://veejayfloresca.com/"">Veejay Floresca</a>, another designer on the CFDA calendar for the first time. “I worked with my team to cast models across sizes, races, ages, and gender identities so that everyone can see themselves in the collection I created. It is so important to me that everyone feels beautiful and can express themselves freely and I hope my collection can bring this to all of my customers.” <br /><br />The casting fully reflected that, with a stunning range of bodies (including <em>Project Runway</em> star plus model Liris Crosse) all looking occasion-ready in sumptuous gowns and suiting. Floresca’s <em>Project Runway</em> mentor Christian Siriano was also in attendance, and it felt both poetic and prophetic that Floresca is also adding to the legacy of embracing true runway diversity. <br /><br />As New York Fashion Week wrapped, social media was only beginning to set itself ablaze with <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DU6qBxcEmoA/?img_index=1"">reactions to the new Netflix documentary centered on <em>America’s Next Top Model</em></a>, particularly  the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/harmful-beauty-standards-artificial-intelligence"">impossible beauty standards</a> that persisted then and seem intent on making a vicious comeback today. While reactions to the show — and the harmful standards that were upheld in the era of <em>ANTM — </em>are rightfully horrified, it’s worth looking at the present in the same lens.<br /><br />Fashion is meant to be forward-looking, creative, and progressive, but all too often falls into the “that’s just the way things are” default.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p><strong>Designers letting themselves off the diversity hook now, thinking the current wave of regressive and exclusionary ideals will be an excuse, will inevitably find themselves on the wrong side of history. </strong></p><cite>Sarah Chiwaya</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>For now, the bright spots and the designers that see fashion for all will keep me going. As Curwen said after his show: “Those who are told ‘no’ the most in the industry are the ones we pay the most attention to.” In doing so, Curwen and designers like him set themselves apart from the crowded field of brands all targeting the least populous market (aka straight sizes). Here’s hoping the industry gets on board with this more expansive view of who belongs in fashion, and other designers see the opportunity that true inclusion presents, for both business and the human obligation. </p>

<p>As a fashion writer, dressing up for New York Fashion Week is both exhilarating and daunting to me (especially during the February shows when a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-jackets-for-women"">winter coat</a> can make or break your outfit). Do I opt for an all-black, NY journalist uniform? Do I try to go all out like one of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-street-style"">Getty-photographed fashion darlings</a>? Or do I dress on-theme for specific shows? Decisions, decisions!<br /><br />At this point, I’ve grown accustomed to the chaos and long days of NYFW, so I like to plan my outfits well ahead of time. When I was planning out this season’s looks for seven straight days, I predominately considered pieces that I’d feel most comfortable in — because when I left my BK home, I certainly wasn’t going back to do a not-so-quick change in the middle of my packed schedule.<br /><br />Leaning on the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-2026-fashion-beauty-lookbook"">Refinery29’s Winter 2026 Lookbook</a> for some outfit inspiration, I decided that — with what I already had in my closet and what brands graciously leant to me for the week — I’d put my own twist on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-fashion-beauty-trends-forecast-2025-2026"">“The Demuralist” look</a> (with hints of The Weather-Maxxer and The Holiday Host aesthetics) for Day 2 of NYFW.<br /><br />In this reimagined Roaring Twenties look: “The all-black uniform gets a festive lift here with sequins and quietly elegant accessories.” While I’m not the most sparkly person, I took bits and pieces from this modern flapper aesthetic and styled a glam look that could take me from day to night, across the city, and confidently into five designers’ runway shows.<br /><br />Ahead, see how I interpreted R29’s stylist-vetted Demuralist trend, the exact pieces I wore (including an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-trends"">on-trend hat moment</a>), and outfit inspo to get you through the rest of the frigid winter in style. </p>

<p>Some themes of “The Demuralist” include dark palettes, luxe details, and rich textures. “We wanted to lean into this idea of the ‘20s and that being a reference point for celebration,” stylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/christinenicholson__/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Christine Nicholson</a> told me behind the scenes of the R29 photoshoot. “We kept the idea of craftsmanship as it relates to things like beading, but made it feel new and fresh.” <br /><br />Taking style cues (but not hard and fast rules) from the lookbook, I opted for my black <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/madewell-alexa-chung-collaboration-2024"">Madewell x Alexa Chung</a> oversized corduroy blazer, rather than a statement dress. I just love the thick fabric and unexpected bright-white buttons. I doubled down on the textures of this look by wearing a white ribbed sweater with fluffy wrist cuffs (that perfectly peeked out from my blazer sleeves) from <a href=""https://www.cupshe.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cupshe</a>. And while the R29 model was styled in funky culottes under her <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/spring-dress-trends-2025"">drop-waist dress</a>, I chose my unassumingly stretchy and comfy trousers from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-lululemon-gifts"">Lululemon</a> that I knew would keep my legs warm.<br /><br />With my base layers offering a more masculine silhouette, it then came time to jazz up the look with feminine flapper energy through accessorizing. </p>

<p>The Demuralist look consists of long sequined gloves (Note: opera gloves were everywhere during NYFW!), fuzzy Mary Jane heels, and, of course, a spectacular headpiece. And to my delight, I knew just the pieces that would give a similar festive and vintage flair, that felt wearable; not just editorial. <br /><br />I excitedly whipped out the funky magenta fur mittens I had purchased as a tween. (While they at one point revolted me, they’re of course back in style and add a touch of whimsy to every winter outfit.) I also slipped on my burgundy <a href=""https://www.vivaia.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Vivaia</a> knit waterproof boots, which were the perfect touch of color and texture (and sensible for the snowy streets).<br /><br />The cherry on top of this ’20s-esque look came about while rummaging through <a href=""https://tjmaxx.tjx.com/store/index.jsp"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">TJ Maxx</a> (my favorite pastime). I stumbled on a burgundy faux fur trapper-like hat that felt like it was from a past era, and knew I wanted to wear it during NYFW.<br /><br />The final touch (that I picked up just one day before NYFW) was an incredible faux fur scarf-shawl-hybrid from <a href=""https://misscircle.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miss Circle</a>. It was so luxe and dramatic, and helped me channel some flapper energy. (It also brought me the biggest compliments from industry peers throughout the day!)</p>

<p>While translating a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-2026-fashion-beauty-lookbook"">bold editorial photoshoot fashion look</a> into a wearable IRL look was at first daunting, the final outcome wound up being one of my favorite NYFW outfits to date.<br /><br />Taking notes from the R29 Lookbook helped inspire an outfit I may have never put together otherwise. In the end, my interpretation had me feeling festive, comfortable, confident, and most importantly, like myself. And I can say with confidence that you <em>have </em>to try it for yourself too.</p>

<p>As a beauty editor of ten years, I’ve been a guest at a fair share of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dyson-hairstyling-tools-worth-it-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">hair tool</a> launch events, from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-flexfusion-styler-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">blow-out brushes</a> that are like having your own personal hairstylist, to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mermade-hair-curling-iron-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">curling irons</a> that use clever mechanisms to draw your hair in and form a perfect tousle. But none have drawn as many collective “Oohs” and “Ahhs” from my editor peers as <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fshark-silkipro-straight-wet-to-dry-straightener-rapid-blow-dryer-plum-satin%2FHT400PU.html%3Fdwvar_HT400PU_color%3DA875B3"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shark’s new SilkiPro</a>. </p>



<p>I know what you’re thinking: <em>another hair tool?</em> And you’d have a fair point. In recent years, Shark has unveiled the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fbuild-your-own-shark-glam-hot-tool-air-styling-drying-system%2FHD6000PKSN.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glam AirStyling System</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fshark-glossi-2-in-1-hot-tool-and-air-glosser-juniper%2FHT302TL.html%3Fdwvar_HT302TL_color%3D429195"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glossi Hot Tool</a>, and the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fbuild-your-own-shark-flexstyle-air-styling-drying-system-stone%2FHD400SN.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">FlexStyle Drying and Styling System</a> (a personal favorite of mine). But the SilkiPro Straight is different. No, really — it straightened my thick, wavy hair in ten minutes flat when it usually takes 30. But more on that later.  </p>



<h2>What is Shark’s SilkiPro Straight and what are the benefits? </h2>



<p><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fshark-silkipro-straight-wet-to-dry-straightener-rapid-blow-dryer-plum-satin%2FHT400PU.html%3Fdwvar_HT400PU_color%3DA875B3"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shark’s SilkiPro</a> is a wet-to-dry straightener and blowdryer in one. Imagine your current flat iron had discreet vents inside that released warm air for a smoother finish with every pass, and you’ve got the idea.  </p>



<p>At the bottom of the tool, there’s a slide-up button that lets you select a mode for wet or damp hair, which emits heated airflow — with the intensity controlled via a separate button. There’s another mode for dry hair, which relies solely on the ceramic straightening plates, without additional airflow. In other words, it combines everything you love about a flat iron — quick, high-shine results — with the benefits of a blowdry brush like less frizz and a smoother finish.  </p>



<p>Perhaps the most brilliant feature is the built-in blowdryer. You can lock the tool closed, and the airflow comes out from the sides, letting you rough-dry your hair before styling. </p>

<h2>What makes Shark’s SilkiPro Straight special? </h2>



<p>At Shark’s launch event, I was lucky enough to see the tool in action on two models — one with very thick, curly hair and another with fine, wavy hair. LA-based hairstylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jaybirmingham_/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jay Birmingham</a> was on hand to demonstrate, and I was mesmerized by how quickly it slid through the first model’s curls, leaving a sleek handful of hair in just a couple of passes.  </p>



<p>According to Birmingham, this is largely thanks to the smart, inconspicuous slots inside the tool, which accommodate combs in three different sizes — all included with the tool. Birmingham explained that if you usually “chase” your straightener with a comb or brush to achieve a smooth, sleek finish, there’s no need anymore — it’s essentially built in. The larger wide-tooth comb is especially brilliant for thick, curly, and coily hair.  </p>



<p>On the model with finer, straighter hair, Birmingham demonstrated how to create flat-iron waves by clamping the straightener on the hair and twisting it downward. When he released, it produced the most effortless tousled look. </p>

<h2>What’s the difference between Shark’s SilkiPro Straight and the Dyson AirStrait? </h2>



<p>Now, you’re probably wondering how the SilkiPro compares to Dyson’s AirStrait. While they look similar at first glance, they’re actually quite different. The AirStrait doesn’t have ceramic hot plates, whereas the SilkiPro does. This means you can use it without airflow on dry hair to straighten, create waves, or touch up your style. If you ask me, it’s also lighter and perhaps quieter — and unlike the Dyson, it comes with those aforementioned slide-in combs.  </p>



<p>Dyson’s hallmark is that its tools don’t cause heat damage, so you might assume the ceramic plates on the SilkiPro would fry your hair like a traditional straightener. Fortunately, the SilkiPro has heat sensors that adjust the temperature automatically when it gets too hot, lending silky results without split ends. Of course, repeatedly going over a section or holding the plates down for too long can still cause damage, but because it works so quickly, one or two slow passes is usually enough. (And I always recommend heat protection.) </p>



<p>In terms of results, Dyson’s tool leaves hair looking more naturally straight and swishy, while Shark’s makes mine look sleek and pin-straight. If you have layers, and you like a tool that gives your lengths some movement, the former might be a better option, or one of Shark’s round blowdry brushes.  </p>



<p>At $249.99, it’s not exactly budget-friendly, but it is slightly more affordable than the AirStrait.</p>

<h2>What to know about Shark’s SilkiPro Straight Wet to Dry Straightener + Rapid Blow Dryer </h2>



<p><strong>• </strong>A straightener-meets-blowdryer featuring different levels of airflow and temperature-controlled ceramic plates for straightening, blow-drying, and creating waves. </p>



<p><strong>• </strong>Comes with three slide-in comb attachments: a wide-tooth comb for curly or coily hair, a gentle comb for natural straight styles, and a precision comb for maximum tension. </p>



<p>• Lightweight, quiet, and suitable for all hair types.  </p>



<h2>How do you use Shark’s SilkiPro Straight? </h2>



<p>Although “wet” is in the name, SilkiPro is best used on damp or towel-dried hair. I used the blowdryer function to rough-dry my hair to about 90% dry before switching to the “For WET Hair” setting on medium heat with full airflow. Happily, you can choose both the temperature and airflow level to suit you. </p>



<p>I have one stubborn step-like wave at the back of my head, which hairstylists usually struggle to smooth with a blowdryer and round brush, but this smoothed them out in just two passes. The chunky ceramic plates, combined with the extra airflow, work together to make hair silky, straight, and soft without much effort. </p>



<p>While the tool itself looks quite large, I can confirm that because the ceramic plates extend all the way to the tip, it’s easy to reach the roots and smooth out frizz and flyaways. I managed to straighten all my hair in just 10 minutes, when it usually takes me 30. Some might call it sorcery, but I know Shark has been quietly perfecting this behind the scenes for years. </p>



<p>Beyond the smart plates and directed airflow, the gentle comb attachment helped the tool glide through my knotty hair like a hot knife through butter. I also love that the tool quiets down when you put it down and starts up again when you pick it up, making it less overstimulating. </p>



<p>Will it replace my trusty Shark Glossi? I think so — once I’ve grown my layers out. I prefer a blunt cut with straight hair on me. That said, my friends with curly hair are already eyeing it up, so who knows how long I’ll be able to hold onto it… </p>

<p>I’ve been to a lot of fashion shows. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-street-style"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">New York Fashion Week</a> is basically a sport at this point and I’m basically an Olympian. You prep, you glam, you Uber in heels because you can’t actually walk in them, and you pray the show starts late. I’ve mastered the rhythm. I know how to move. But this time, it felt different. Because for the first time ever, I wasn’t just attending a show, I was being dressed for one. And not just by anyone. By <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sergiohudson/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sergio Hudson</a>. For his <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-ready-to-wear/sergio-hudson"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Fall/Winter 2026</a> runway. On his 10th anniversary. I’m still pinching myself.  </p>



<p><strong>My Favorite Room During Fashion Week</strong> </p>



<p>Sergio Hudson’s show is hands down my favorite show to attend during New York Fashion Week. The collections are always versatile. Whether you’re a corporate baddie running a boardroom, the belle of the ball at a gala, or just a fashion girly who loves to throw that fit on, Sergio has a piece for you. And his casting is inclusive. Always. In a fashion world that still struggles with representation, his runway actually looks like us.   </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960041.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The room itself feels like the hottest and chicest invite of the year but never exclusive in a weird way. Everyone from <a href=""https://www.gettyimages.dk/detail/news-photo/yolanda-adams-sergio-hudson-and-monica-attend-sergio-hudson-news-photo/2261636426"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Monica</a> to <a href=""https://hellobeautiful.com/4581318/jackie-aina-nyfw/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jackie Aina</a> was there. And somehow, no one feels more important than the other. You feel like you belong. </p>



<p><strong>The Showroom Moment</strong> </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960042.jpg?width=583&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=583%3A1024"" /><figcaption>Screenshot</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>A few days before the show, I went to the Sergio Hudson showroom to find my look. My first option was a red blazer moment. It was giving “I own the company,” but I wasn’t fully sold. I wanted a <em>moment</em>. Then one of the stylists pulled out a silver sequin dress and I knew. I paired it with a gray wool coat draped over my shoulders and yeah, this was the bold statement I needed to make. It felt regal, dramatic, and intentional. All I needed were silver heels to finish it off. If you’re going to be dressed by Sergio Hudson for his 10th anniversary show, you don’t play small. </p>



<p><strong>Fashion Week Tried Me</strong> </p>



<p>Now here’s where the plot thickens. Show day was a mess. On the day of the show, I still hadn’t found the perfect shoes. I had two hair appointments. I had to shower, do my makeup, get dressed, and be there by 6:45 PM. </p>



<p>Appointments got pushed. My hair didn’t finish until 5 PM. I rushed home, threw on my dress, did my makeup with one eye on the clock, and ran out the door. I got in the Uber at 6:20 PM. and because it’s New York… traffic!  </p>



<p>What should have been a quick ride turned into over an hour. I was panicking the entire time. All that prep. All that anticipation. Just to possibly miss the show? I felt defeated sitting in that back seat. But by the grace of God, I made it. The show started ten minutes after I arrived. And I’m choosing to be a delusional queen and believe they stalled it for me.  </p>



<p><strong>10 Years of Excellence</strong> </p>



<p>The collection was out of this world. Bold colors. Chic tailoring. Fierce models. Looks that quite literally took your breath away. It felt celebratory but forward. A reminder that ten years in this industry, especially as a Black designer, is no small thing.  </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.essence.com/fashion/sergio-hudson-10th-anniversary-show-fashion-fw26-nyfw/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ten years </a>of vision. Ten years of staying true. Ten years of dressing powerful women and men in pieces that command attention.  </p>

<p>It’s safe to say my outfit was a hit. As I walked into the show and later as walked out, people were taking photos of me. Complimenting the dress. Stopping me mid-step. For a moment, I felt like a queen.  </p>



<p>Being dressed by a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-designers-fashion-technology"">Black designer</a>, celebrating his milestone, and sitting in a room filled with culture, excellence, and intention will always be one of the highlights of my career.  </p>



<p>Supporting Black-owned designers like Sergio Hudson isn’t just about fashion, it’s about community. It’s about showing up for the people who reflect us, design for us, and see us. I already can’t wait for the next show. </p>

<p>Over the last week, New York City proved its status as a fashion capital of the world, with talented designers showcasing creative collections on the runways, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-street-style"">in the streets</a>, and on our feeds.

Ranging from metal sculptures from the likes of Caroline Herrera, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-x-cult-gaia-collaboration-shop"">Cult Gaia</a>, and Tory Burch; crystal cascades courtesy of Collina Strada; 3D glass florals by Caroline Zimbalist; and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUvv79tCbKo/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sergio Hudson</a>’s fabric-covered designs, many brands put their seal of approval on a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/designer-fashion-secondhand-the-realreal-ebay-poshmark"">vintage staple</a>.<br /><br />These modern designs might look out of place in your grandmother’s jewelry box (but that doesn’t mean she won’t want to borrow your baubles from time to time!). Pin them to your sweater, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-jackets-for-women"">winter coat</a>, or to secure your scarf for fashion <em>and</em> function. </p>

<h2>Animals Gone Wild</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959932.png?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>I can confidently say that animal prints will never go out of style. In fact, they’ve essentially become neutrals that can seamlessly integrate into everyone’s wardrobes today. This season, brands like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/old-navy-anna-sui-collaboration-2025"">Anna Sui</a>, Norma Kamali, Ralph Lauren, and Ulla Johnson tapped the fan-favorite cheetah and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-leopard-print-2"">leopard prints</a>. Looking to find inspiration from other corners of the animal kingdom? Kim Shui and Markarian introduced tiger prints, while Kate Hundley and Sergio Hudson offered snakeskin sets, and Bronx and Banco sent out a zebra purse.<br /><br />Animal illustrations were also big sources of inspiration, as Alix of Bohemia featured a whole zoo worth of animal prints and embellishments (think: giraffes and monkeys!). Swans also popped up across Tanner Fletcher outerwear and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DU4lDRfiI_F/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Aknvas</a> button-downs if avian-inspired looks are more your style.</p>

<h2><strong>The Grunge &amp; Indie Sleaze Scene</strong></h2>

<p>For those of us who <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-sandy-liang-collaboration-2025"">crave nostalgia</a>, it’s exciting to note that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/madewell-alexa-chung-collaboration-2025"">the ‘90s</a> and early 2000s have never been more back! Specifically, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/joaquina-90s-grunge-era-jcpenney-collection"">moody grunge</a> and indie sleaze party-girl aesthetics are having a moment, with dark palettes, messy styling, and even disheveled, slept-in hair (look no further than Collina Strada’s models for proof). <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-dresses-for-women"">Plaid prints</a> featured heavily in the anchor pieces of several collections, including <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/coach-handbag-trends"">Coach</a>’s youthful blazers as well as Collina Strada’s and Private Policy’s dresses.<br /><br />The <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUuHzuajEmc/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">7 For All Mankind runway show</a> was also a master class in early-aughts styling, down to the energy and even the <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUuXgANjkvZ/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">models’ viral walks</a>. Think, lots of layering, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/denim-trends-2026"">all-denim-everything</a>, skinny scarves, platform pumps, jumbo shoulder bags, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-chunky-jewelry"">chunky jewelry</a> all together — because in this case, more is more. </p>

<h2>Hat Attack</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959935.png?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>Bundling up in the cold has never looked so chic. Hats and headpieces served as the cherry on top of this season’s runway looks, serving inspiration for right now and next winter. Designers especially made the case for having headwear for every outfit and event, no matter how casual or fancy. Designs included chic pillbox hats and caps that tie around the neck (Christian Cowan), fur trapper hats and headbands (Aknvas and Bronc and Banco), oversized knit silhouettes (Advisry), extra-long beanies (Private Policy), lace skull caps (Prabal Gurung and LaQuan Smith), and beaded head coverings (Jane Wade) across womenswear <em>and</em> menswear alike.<br /><br />The impossibly stylish <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/02/11856777/asap-rocky-verdict-court-case-timeline"">A$AP Rocky</a> even wore a fur trapper to close out the NYFW debut of his brand AWGE, giving hats a celebrity stamp of approval! </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>All Laced Up</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959936.png?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>While the collections that New York City’s designers showed this season weren’t as stiff or structured as some in the past, lacing still showed up as a major throughline. For proof, look no further than Adeam’s, Elena Velez’s, and Meruert Tolegen’s not-so-basic corsets and dresses.<br /><br />Those seeking more casual interpretations of the trend can turn to Kate Hundley’s lace-up <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-puffer-jacket"">puffer jacket</a>, which is proof that your winter puffer can not only not ruin your outfit; it can make your entire look. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUxFffpjp26/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Gabe Gordon</a>’s lace-up knit skirt also feels as right for après ski as it does for a Saturday <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nyfw-fall-winter-2024-trends"">athleisure look</a>. Laces even made their way into the models’ hair at Caroline Zimbalist as an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-haircut-trends-fall-winter-2026"">unexpected hairstyle trend</a>.</p>

Having a pair felt like everything. I remember dreaming about them, imagining how it would feel to finally wear them and show them off,” she told the publication. <br /><br />The sneakers were so popular among Latine youth that Reebok even collaborated with the biggest star of reggaeton at the time, Daddy Yankee, for a “DY” signature sneaker and apparel line in 2005.<br /><br />Now, with reggaeton one of the most popular genres in the world and Karol G as one of its front-runners, it’s her turn. And the Grammy award-winning singer isn’t just wearing Reebok Classics like she dreamed — campaign photos of her in the 131-year-old footwear brand can be seen all over, from Medellín to the rest of the world. <br /><br />As part of “Born Classic. Worn For Life,” the sports culture brand launched its most popular lifestyle sneakers crafted in 100% real, full-grain premium garment leather, including Club C 85 Vintage, Freestyle Lo, Workout Plus. <br /><br />And while the sneakers were just made available on February 18, <a href=""https://wwd.com/footwear-news/shoe-trends/karol-g-reebok-ambassador-media-impact-value-1238514597/"">WWD reported</a> in late January that just the announcement of Karol G as Reebok’s latest ambassador generated $1.1 million in Media Impact Value (MIV) in 48 hours for the footwear brand. <br /><br />Swipe to see what all the hype is about.<figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959871.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=2400&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""2400"" /><figcaption><strong>Club C 85 Vintage</strong> <br /><br />When Reebok introduced the Club C 85 in 1985, it was a clean, performance-driven sneaker built for tennis champions.

<p>Over the last few days, the social media firing squad has been aimed at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tyrabanks/"">Tyra Banks</a> and the producers behind <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363307/""><em>America’s Next Top Model</em></a>, the cultural phenomenon of a reality show that aired from 2003 to 2018 and spawned dozens of international spinoffs. <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/81928842?trackId=259776131&amp;trkId=259776131&amp;src=tudum""><em>Reality Check: Inside America’s Next Top Model</em></a> is proof that the more things change, the more they stay the same.</p>



<p>The Netflix docuseries, which premiered on February 11, featured firsthand accounts from models, including <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ebonyehaith/?hl=en"">Ebony Haith</a> (Cycle 1), <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/shandithecatlady/?hl=en"">Shandi Sullivan</a> (Cycle 2) and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/danievans1/?hl=en"">Danielle Evans</a> (Cycle 6) as well as judges <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/mrjaymanuel/?hl=en"">Jay Manuel</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/miss_jalexander/?hl=en"">J. Alexander</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/nigelbarker/?hl=en"">Nigel Barker</a>. Through three episodes, viewers get a firsthand look at the exploitative conditions contestants were subjected to each cycle. That included extreme makeovers using plastic surgery and dental work, blackface and racist stereotypes as photoshoot themes and a sexual assault that was intentionally caught on film. Banks and former <em>ANTM</em> executive producer <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0596298/"">Ken Mok</a>, who both served as executive producers for <em>Reality Check</em>, were also interviewed.</p>



<p>For 24 cycles, Banks was able to bully women into becoming the American ideal standard of what the “ideal woman” was at that time. And for millennials who were coming of age at the height of the show, it was not only appointment television; it was a rubric for how to become worthy of adoration.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959823.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /><figcaption>Reality Check: Inside America’s Next Top Model.

<p><em>ANTM</em> was one of the first times millennials witnessed hyperfemininity politics on display in the media through a reality show competition. As a little Black girl from the Midwest, watching the women who looked like me on the show further ingrained a conditioning that was already at play: that, to the world, I could only be beautiful with conditions. With <em>Reality Check</em>, flashbacks of Ebony’s gorgeous skin being called dull and ashy came rushing to the forefront. Danielle Evans being pressured to close her gap influenced me to want braces (thank you for not acquiescing, mom). Watching judges dismiss the concerns of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/iamtoccarajones/?hl=en"">Tocarra Jones</a> (Cycle 3), a full-figured woman from my hometown who I grew up looking up to, injured my confidence as I grew into my own curves.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Banks skirts accountability in an astonishingly delusional manner throughout the docuseries. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>And as a child, I was convinced Black girls couldn’t show their hurt like <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1909197/"">Tiffany Richardson</a> (Cycle 4) did, lest be seen as aggressive, ungrateful and undeserving.</p>



<p>“It was very, very intense but you guys were demanding it, and so we kept pushing more and more and more,” Banks said in <em>Reality Check</em>.</p>



<p>Banks skirts accountability in an astonishingly delusional manner throughout the docuseries. The trauma this show left with these women — especially the sexual assault of Shandi, which the documentary doesn’t name as such — was real, and Banks is to blame. At the same time, there’s some validity in her statement that we can’t ignore. No, viewers didn’t force Banks to exploit these women,  and much of the trauma they were subjected to has come into perspective only recently, but the buck doesn’t stop with Banks or this show.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959833.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /><figcaption>Reality Check: Inside America’s Next Top Model. Dani Evans in Reality Check: Inside America’s Next Top Model. Cr. Courtesy of Netflix © 2026</figcaption></figure>



<p><em>ANTM</em> wasn’t just a look into the exploitative extremes models experienced behind the scenes. It held a mirror up to the homogenous beauty standards that Americans celebrated in the early to mid aughts. The message was resounding: thin and white was right. And if you were a woman of color, you better adapt quickly if you want to get anywhere.</p>



<p>As we sit firmly in 2026, it’s clear how wrong Banks and the producers were in their abuse of power. But what’s being overlooked is that history is repeating itself right before our eyes.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p><em>ANTM</em> wasn’t just a look into the exploitative extremes models experienced behind the scenes. It held a mirror up to the homogenous beauty standards that Americans celebrated in the early to mid aughts.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>With social media, there’s an insurmountable pressure that comes with showing up as your best. And unlike in 2003, the feedback is in real time. With a growing amount of content creators and influencers relying on social media platforms for their livelihoods, it takes more time, energy and money than ever before to keep up with appearances. For many, that’s the difference between economic stability or missing out on opportunities.</p>



<p>Body positivity feels like a thing of the past as the idea of thinness reemerges as a status symbol and the <a href=""https://www.today.com/video/cosmetic-surgery-is-drawing-younger-patients-and-more-men-250889285677"">demand for cosmetic procedures</a> for younger groups increases. Doctors and marketers <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/glp-1-brands-enter-their-super-bowl-era/"">push GLP-1s</a> on any and everyone regardless of clinical need. And <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sydney_sweeney/"">Sydney Sweeney’s</a> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/08/11924722/sydney-sweeney-american-eagle-ad-controversy-republican-trump"">“great jeans” American Eagle ad</a> feels in conversation with <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/miketyson/"">Mike Tyson’s</a> <a href=""https://mashable.com/article/mike-tyson-super-bowl-ad-maha-fatphobia"">fat shaming Super Bowl ad</a> funded by Make America Healthy Again.</p>



<p>In addition, the needle hasn’t moved much on Black women being labeled “aggressive” and facing <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/07/11923428/jana-craig-love-island-kenny-rodriguez-breakup"">microaggressions and outright racism</a> on and off screen. Even in the show “The Traitors,” Black contestants are given <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/jan/09/black-contestants-the-traitors-reality-tv"">far less grace</a> to prove themselves as “faithfuls” due to stereotypes being used as evidence of their integrity.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959856.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=799&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A799"" /></figure>



<p>So many of us who watched <em>ANTM</em> growing up have done work to divorce ourselves from the limiting beliefs that the show and others instilled in us growing up. (For me, that looked like embracing my curves and natural hair.) But witnessing progressive ideas of beauty disappear in media while it simultaneously shames Banks feels a bit hypocritical.</p>



<p>It’s frustrating to see Banks refuse to take accountability for her wrongdoings and have the nerve to tease a Cycle 25 that may go to less extremes but will be likely to fall into old patterns. But what’s also true is that she is the perfect scapegoat for this moment to keep us comfortable in repeating the same mistakes. There’s a regressiveness happening that we can’t ignore. Today, it’s a reality check that our favorite show perpetuated the same system it said it wanted to change. Tomorrow it’s something far more sinister. </p>

<p>When it comes to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/phantom-french-cat-eye-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">my manicure</a>, I’m pretty unadventurous. As soon as I sit down at my local salon, my nail tech knows exactly what to ask: “Your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tinted-glow-french-manicure-nails-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">usual French</a>?” And the answer is always yes. To me, a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/modern-french-manicure-nail-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">French manicure</a> — whether the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/deep-french-tips-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">classic white tip</a> or something a bit cooler, like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glass-french-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">cat-eye</a> — strikes the perfect balance between timeless and elevated, and it takes a lot to sway me from it. But the trending “reverse” French manicure might just change that. </p>



<h2>What is the reverse French manicure?  </h2>



<p>The reverse French manicure isn’t exactly new, but we have <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/iamcardib/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cardi B</a>’s Super Bowl look to thank for its recent comeback. Her nail artist, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/cocamichelle/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Coca Michelle</a>, turned the classic <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUhRw5XEaBA/?img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">French manicure on its head</a> — literally — by flipping the gold tip so it curved around the base of the nail, right at the cuticle. Since then, Google searches for “reverse French manicure” have increased by 110%, as it seems we’re ready to channel Cardi B and try something different. </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sadgirlnails/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Natalia Mercedes</a>, nail artist and founder of <a href=""https://www.sadgirlnails.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sad Girl Nails Studio</a> in New York City, is well-versed in the art of the reverse French manicure. “The reverse French is essentially a flipped take on the classic,” she explains. “Instead of highlighting the tip of the nail, the design hugs the curve of the cuticle with either a thin, delicate line or a thicker, more graphic arc,” — exactly like this beautiful set by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DT7XXe4jOtM/?hl=en"">nail artist Fern Barron</a>. </p>

<p>Mercedes adds that it draws the eye downward. “It frames the nail at its base rather than the edge, which gives it a more unexpected, editorial feel compared to the traditional French.” </p>



<p>She has an idea why it’s becoming so popular again: “It’s a twist on a timeless look, and right now clients are craving fresh ways to stay minimal without feeling boring,” she says. To Mercedes, the reverse French feels modern and intentional — subtle, yet still a statement, like this set by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/C-UWS_asnyw/?hl=en"">Fliss Alton</a>. “It’s perfect for someone who loves ‘clean’ nails but wants something more directional than a standard tip,” adds Mercedes. </p>

<h2>How do you achieve the reverse French manicure? </h2>



<p>Achieving a reverse French manicure is similar to painting a traditional French tip. It calls for the precision of a thin nail brush and a steady, skilled hand as not to flood the cuticle with polish or get any uncured gel on the skin, which could <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gel-nail-allergy"">potentially cause an allergic reaction</a>.  </p>



<p>There’s a clever benefit to reverse French nails, too, but it depends on your color choices: “If you incorporate negative space or a sheer nude at the cuticle area, the grow-out can look incredibly subtle,” says Mercedes. Because the design is already anchored at the base, she adds that it can blend more seamlessly as the nail grows. “This is especially true when softer tones are used,” she says, like nude shades. </p>

<p>Unlike the traditional French tip, the reverse French is much easier to master on shorter nails, like this set by manicurist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPvgxcACOpp/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Charlotte May</a>.
