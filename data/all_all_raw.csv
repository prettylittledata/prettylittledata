<h4><em>It’s not about adding AI, it’s about solving problems better than before.</em></h4><p>Lately, I've seen a shift in the market… one that gives me hope for the future. Instead of asking, <em>&quot;How can we put AI into our product?&quot;</em> the new question to ask is, <em>&quot;How might we solve customer problems with AI?&quot;</em></p><figure><img alt=""Two sales people from the sketch comedy show, Portlandia, with the phrase, &quot;Put a bird on it.&quot;"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5uSmq93bQqBjA9TpYR-Tpw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Put a bird on it — Portlandia, Source <a href=""https://imgur.com/gallery/put-bird-on-xugExlK"">imgur</a></figcaption></figure><p>This seemingly subtle difference represents a massive mindset shift because one question is driven by hype, and the other is driven by value.</p><p>The first question, “How can we add AI?” is <em>trend-chasing</em>. It puts technology before purpose, and often leads to bloated features no one asked for, wasted development time, money, and opportunity cost of building something desired and innovative instead.</p><p>The second, “How can we solve a real problem better with AI?” is <em>value creation</em>. It puts the customer at the center and treats AI as a tool, not a trophy.</p><p>That’s the shift we’re seeing. And it’s the difference between shipping gimmicks and building enduring solutions.</p><h3>Put some AI in it!</h3><p>Since the start of the AI revolution, we've been doing research with both Big Tech and smaller AI-based startups to help them understand their customers and their response to AI-based products and services.</p><p>The initial request was simply to, &quot;Put some AI into the product.&quot; It makes sense: it's a new, emerging technology and it's important to stay competitive…</p><p>What it looked like in real life was a different story: It became more of a race to integrate a chatbot into the product than a process of determining whether a chatbot is really the solution to a problem.</p><p>I mean, unless the business problem is have a chatbot because my competitors also have a chatbot.</p><p>If you remember the sketch comedy show, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portlandia""><em>Portlandia</em></a>, then you might recall the sketch, &quot;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNpIOlDhigw"">Put a bird on it</a>.&quot;</p><p>In the sketch, two well-meaning artists try to help struggling businesses by literally adding birds to random products:</p><blockquote>&quot;Look at this sad little tote bag… I know, I'll put a bird on it!&quot; easily becomes, &quot;Look at this sad Pre-GenAI product… I know, I'll put some AI on it!&quot;</blockquote><p>It’s funny because it’s true. And it’s tragic because it’s happening.</p><p>That sketch nails the problem with trend-first thinking: it’s surface-level. Aesthetic over substance. AI becomes a sticker, not a solution. When you chase a trend, you decorate. When you pursue end-user value, you solve.</p><p>And solving is where the real growth is.</p><p>(Continue watching as it devolves hysterically at your own risk).</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/6b7299b7cee614d163f78c79d427538f/href"">https://medium.com/media/6b7299b7cee614d163f78c79d427538f/href</a><h4>You aren't asking the right question</h4><p>Having spent my career helping companies uncover deep customer pain points and design real solutions, this wave of “just add a chatbot” feels like watching innovation on autopilot.</p><p>It wasn’t strategic. It wasn’t solving for anything. It was tech for tech’s sake fueled by FOMO (Fear of missing out). The real question that drives long-term growth is this:</p><blockquote>“Are we solving our customer’s most urgent problem better than anyone else?”</blockquote><h4>AI is a means to an end</h4><p>Simply adding AI is like when the internet exploded in the mid-90s saying that we needed to add some HTML into our product. Or, to have a website. But a website to do what? To solve what problem?</p><p>AI can help answer that question. But it doesn’t replace the question itself. AI is a means to an end, not the end in itself. And to be clear: the end goal is happy customers that purchase your product or service.</p><p>This is where the mindset shift comes in: It's not about <em>adding AI </em>as much as it's about <em>solving customer problems.</em></p><h3>The mindset shift</h3><p>&quot;I have a new tool in my toolbox. It's called AI. Or Agentic AI. Or an LLM.&quot;</p><p>Ok, cool, what are you going to do with it?</p><p>The real shift is this: instead of jamming AI into an already bloated product roadmap, teams are starting to ask a smarter question:</p><blockquote>“Where can this tool help us solve a customer problem in a better way than we could before?”</blockquote><p>This may sound obvious, but the implications are transformative.</p><p>The best companies aren’t leading with the tool. They’re leading with the outcome. AI is a means, not the mission. A lever, not the solution itself.</p><p>Think of it this way: You used to have a hammer, maybe it was a really good hammer, but it was really good at nails. Now you also have a screwdriver. It's flashy and helps you solve new problems because not every problem is a nail.</p><figure><img alt=""Quote from Star Wars: &quot;These aren't the droids you're looking for.&quot; Obi-Wan Kenobi."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/1*wYrXWxbixlOW_G__CcIiig.png"" /><figcaption>Obi-wan from Star Wars (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/These_aren%27t_the_droids_you%27re_looking_for"">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The shift isn’t just about what tools are available, it’s about what problem you’re solving and what’s now possible because of this new AI toolset.</p><p>The leading Tech companies understand this shift because it comes from a place of power. By reframing the problem and the approach, you're able to stop playing catch-up and start leading the market with your new, innovative approach.</p><p>Leveraging AI for what it does best allows product development teams to focus on what they do best: designing and developing solutions, now with more options on how to solve problems.</p><h3>Taking action</h3><p>If you’re building with AI, here’s your first step: pause and reframe the question.</p><p>Don’t start with, “Where can I use AI?” Instead, start with:</p><blockquote><strong>“What is the biggest, most urgent, and most underserved problem our customers face? And what is now uniquely possible because of AI?”</strong></blockquote><p>To help you shift into this problem-first mindset, try this simple diagnostic:</p><ul><li>What’s the #1 frustration your customers keep bringing up?</li><li>What do they wish they could do but currently can’t?</li><li>If you could wave a magic wand, what would you remove, automate, or radically improve?</li></ul><p>Now ask yourself: does AI give us a new advantage to solve that?</p><p>If the answer is Yes: Great! Keep going and build with intentionality.</p><p>If not: don’t force a square peg into a round hole. This isn't the screw your AI-screwdriver is looking for.</p><h4><strong>Now it's your turn</strong></h4><p>Putting the <em>most </em>AI into your product isn’t a winning strategy. Instead, it’s being <em>intentional</em> and <em>selective</em> about when, where, and why you chose to incorporate AI into your product.</p><p>This is your opportunity to lead the shift inside your team, your company, your product. Solve real problems by being the one who helps your team make the mindset shift and asks the better question.</p><p>That’s how meaningful innovation and growth happens.

<h4>An accessibility-focused evolution of Inter that blends modern geometry with hyperlegible design principles.</h4><figure><img alt=""Cover image showing the name “Hyperlegible Sans” on a dark background, with supporting text describing it as an accessibility-focused evolution of Inter’s modern aesthetic, including version number 1.0, open-source license, and available weights (regular, medium, bold)."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*cYZPrBJzp61844wdgTnRSg.png"" /><figcaption>Hyperlegible Sans, a free, open-source typeface designed as an accessibility-focused evolution of Inter. Version 1.0 includes Regular, Medium, and Bold weights.</figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://github.com/matthewlarn/hyperlegible-sans/releases/latest""><strong>Download Latest Font</strong></a></p><p>I’ve used <a href=""https://rsms.me/inter/"">Inter</a> for years. It’s been my default across dozens of projects and, in my opinion, represents the best of open-source typography. Its clean geometry, strong engineering, and consistent rhythm have made it a staple of modern design systems. Over time, especially while working on accessibility-focused products, I began noticing small limitations. Certain glyphs blurred together at smaller sizes, some bowls felt tight in low-vision contexts, and characters like I, l, and 1 weren’t distinct enough for readers who rely on extra clarity. None of this diminished my respect for Inter, it simply highlighted areas where accessibility could be improved.</p><p>Because of these legibility challenges, when I started doing product work for <a href=""https://loudandclear.io/""><em>Loud + Clear</em></a>, an app designed for people with Parkinson’s, I turned to <a href=""https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/"">Atkinson Hyperlegible</a>. It’s one of the most thoughtfully designed accessibility fonts available, with radically open forms and unmistakable glyph shapes that prioritize clarity. For low-vision users, it excels.</p><p>But I missed Inter’s visual aesthetic, its modern geometry, contemporary rhythm, and the familiarity designers expect in UI typography. I admired Atkinson’s readability and Inter’s overall look, and kept wishing there were a way to bring the strengths of both into a single design.</p><p><strong>Hyperlegible Sans</strong> is the result. It’s an open-source fork of Inter that preserves its modern character while incorporating hyperlegible principles inspired by Atkinson. It isn’t meant to replace either font, just to offer another option, one that didn’t exist before.</p><p>What I changed (and why)</p><p>The philosophy behind Hyperlegible Sans is simple: keep the visual identity of Inter intact, but reduce ambiguity wherever it appears. That meant making targeted, deliberate adjustments rather than redrawing the font from scratch.</p><p>Here are the most impactful changes:</p><figure><img alt=""Comparison image showing Inter on the left and Hyperlegible Sans on the right, with highlighted letters demonstrating clearer apertures, improved differentiation between I, l, and 1, a wider capital O, and a slashed zero in Hyperlegible Sans."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZLD_DI4KANEeF9uaOSqhmQ.png"" /><figcaption>Side-by-side comparison of Inter and Hyperlegible Sans, highlighting changes to ambiguous glyphs, including a, e, I, O, and 0, to improve character differentiation and legibility.</figcaption></figure><h4>Capital I</h4><p>I added subtle top and bottom bars. This keeps it visually aligned with Inter’s geometry while removing its similarity to lowercase l and numeral 1. Low-vision readers rely on disambiguation, and this single change dramatically improves clarity without altering the overall feel.</p><figure><img alt=""Side-by-side comparison of the capital letter I, with Inter on the left as a plain vertical stroke and Hyperlegible Sans on the right with added top and bottom bars to increase clarity and differentiation."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*13DkDS1Lg5mmu5y9oR_qlg@2x.png"" /><figcaption>Capital I comparison demonstrating the addition of subtle top and bottom bars in Hyperlegible Sans to improve distinction from lowercase l and numeral 1.</figcaption></figure><h4>Lowercase l</h4><p>I added a small baseline spur.

It also provides more visual stability inside dense UI strings.</p><figure><img alt=""Side-by-side comparison of the lowercase letter l, with Inter on the left as a simple vertical stroke and Hyperlegible Sans on the right featuring a small baseline spur for clearer identification."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Hf9uflQ_kG2hmDbAonbjRg.png"" /><figcaption>Lowercase l comparison showing the addition of a small baseline spur in Hyperlegible Sans to reduce confusion with the numeral 1.</figcaption></figure><h4>Zero</h4><p>I added a slash.

Crowding can become a barrier. Certain letter combinations can merge when users read with low acuity.</p><p>I added additional kerning space to pairs that commonly collapse:</p><ul><li>rn, ri, rl</li><li>fi, fl, ft, tt</li><li>ii, ll, il, li</li><li>la</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Side-by-side image comparing Inter and Hyperlegible Sans kerning for letter pairs such as rn, ri, rl, fi, fl, ft, tt, ii, ll, il, li, and la, with Hyperlegible Sans showing increased spacing to improve clarity and prevent visual merging."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9SjhTB_ThOhCqilQGem5jQ.png"" /><figcaption>Comparison of kerning-sensitive letter pairs in Inter and Hyperlegible Sans, showing increased spacing for combinations that commonly collapse in low-vision or dense UI text.</figcaption></figure><p>These are small changes, but small changes can have large effects. Hyperlegibility is often achieved through a series of minor adjustments that build up to meaningful improvements in clarity.</p><h3>The design belief behind this project</h3><p>Accessibility shouldn’t require compromising aesthetics.</p><p>A font shouldn’t look “special” or “different” to be inclusive. Good typography should simply work for everyone.</p><p>Hyperlegible Sans reflects a belief I carry into every project: <strong>design can be both beautiful and accessible</strong>.</p><p>We don’t need to choose between modern geometry and clear letterforms. We can have both.</p><p>Design is full of these false choices, and part of the work is expanding the range of tools available so designers can choose what best fits their intentions.</p><h3>What’s next for Hyperlegible Sans</h3><p>This is only version 1. The roadmap includes:</p><ul><li>additional weights</li><li>a full variable font</li><li>expanded punctuation</li><li>broader language support</li><li>refinements for dark mode and low-contrast environments</li></ul><p>And like Inter, this project is open-source. I’m uploading the complete files to GitHub, along with documentation on the changes and a roadmap for future versions.</p><p>My hope is simple: that this font becomes another tool in the accessibility toolkit. Something UI designers, developers, and product teams can reach for when they need both clarity and beauty, when they want typography that reflects how modern design should work.</p><p>Not less beautiful. Not more clinical. Just clearer, easier, more humane.</p><p><a href=""https://github.com/matthewlarn/hyperlegible-sans""><strong>View “Hyperlegible Sans” on Github</strong></a></p><figure><img alt=""Text layout titled “Why Legibility Matters,” explaining how clear letterforms and spacing improve readability, reduce cognitive effort, and support comfortable reading in conditions such as small sizes, low contrast, or motion."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*A0mM6d5g12cE1BdBg-qr7A.png"" /><figcaption>Legibility-focused text sample demonstrating how clearer letterforms, consistent spacing, and strong character differentiation reduce cognitive load and improve reading comfort.</figcaption></figure><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=7b3c823692fb"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/hyperlegible-sans-a-free-open-source-font-for-accessible-design-7b3c823692fb"">Hyperlegible Sans: a free, open-source font for accessible design</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4><strong><em>How brand, data, and reuse help ideas move past the demo phase</em></strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Music platform screens vibe coded with various AI tools like Anima and Uizard"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IZ6fOsQkSAw4pHD1iXAFuA.png"" /><figcaption><em>Music platform screens vibe coded with various AI tools like Anima and Uizard</em></figcaption></figure><p>As designers, we know there are many tools at our disposal to create AI-generated UI, like Lovable, Anima, and Uizard. There has been a lot of progress in this space, with AI output at unthinkable speeds and of unprecedented quality. But still…most of it feels short-lived and unusable.</p><p><strong>The generated screens look convincing, but they’re treated as placeholders instead of starting points in the ideation process</strong>. For instance, when a generated screen needs to reflect a brand’s styling, handle real data, or align with existing patterns, the work has to be rebuilt (and the generated UI is tossed).</p><p>This is simply a mismatch between how UI is generated in AI tools and how products are actually built. So instead of avoiding constraints such as branding and data, they need to be integrated into the generation process. This way, the UI becomes more valuable and can be used to continue to iterate past a demo or proof of concept (POC) phase.</p><p>Let’s look at 3 constraints (brand styles, data, and pattern reuse) that separate generated UI that gets discarded versus UI that is used end-to-end in the product development cycle</p><h3>Start with a brand versus restyling later</h3><p>AI-generated screens typically use visual styles that are neutral, like system-default colors and typography. Though the UI feels “close enough,” it’s not truly accurate to your product’s brand (or any other brand you want to test). And once real branding is introduced, the UI designs break down from the gaps created from the neutral styling used during generation.</p><p><strong>This ultimately causes rework to better incorporate the product’s branding (either restyling elements or starting over completely)</strong>. To avoid this issue, brand alignment must become part of the initial AI prompt versus being considered as extra steps to fix in later stages.</p><figure><img alt=""UI generated by Anima that is inspired by the Airbnb brand and AI prompting"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IJ-5YTLl4BBmz8LZKf_17g.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lMHFWD8I3E""><em>Anima generates UI inspired by a brand</em></a><em> (like Airbnb) from the first AI prompt, and can make modifications to individual elements as needed</em></figcaption></figure><p>But generating UI with brand context doesn’t eliminate design judgment– it more so reduces how much work gets discarded. When generated UI reflects a real brand early in the design or ideation process, it becomes something teams can refine rather than replace.</p><h4>How to integrate branding and generated UI</h4><p>Many of the AI tools we already know are beginning to account for specific brand inclusion:</p><ul><li><strong>Anima</strong>: With <a href=""https://dev.animaapp.com/"">Anima Playground</a>, you can generate an application using the visual language of an existing brand. Just write the app you want to build, along with the brand to use as inspiration (from your own brand to Airbnb’s). You can also refine individual UI elements or adjust inline copy without regenerating the designs again and again.</li><li><strong>Uizard</strong>: <a href=""https://uizard.io/autodesigner/"">Uizard’s Auto-designer</a> allows you to write a text-based prompt, then select a style (from a screenshot, URL, or brand kit). After the designs are generated, you can modify elements and generate themes.</li><li><strong>Google Stitch</strong>: Similar to the other tools, <a href=""https://stitch.withgoogle.com/"">Google Stitch</a> generates screens based on your prompt, which can include brand styling. Stitch’s output is solid, but you cannot modify individual elements; you can only use an entire screen as reference for modification requests.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""UI generated by Google Stitch that is based on the prompted brand"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0HsQrO4-IZeMRk-WU1V6-g.png"" /><figcaption><em>Google Stitch generates screens based on the requested brand, but can only modify entire screens versus single elements</em></figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: Some of the tools, like Anima, generate the UI with flexibility and can be restyled with </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lMHFWD8I3E""><em>different branding inspirations</em></a><em> without rebuilding the entire layout. So you can easily compare visual directions or get stakeholder feedback.</em></blockquote><h4>Benefits of branding from the start</h4><ul><li><strong>Faster alignment</strong>: Introducing brand context early reduces the gap between initial concepts and stakeholder expectations (shifting feedback away from styling and toward design intent)</li><li><strong>Comparison between directions</strong>: Applying different brand styles to the same layout makes it easy to evaluate options without redesigning the experience each time</li><li><strong>Less restyling later</strong>: When typography, colors, and tone are set from the start, teams spend less time retrofitting as the design evolves</li></ul><h4>Limits of branding with AI tools</h4><ul><li><strong>Surface-level branding</strong>: AI-driven branding captures visual cues like color and type, but doesn’t replace a deeper Design System</li><li><strong>Accessibility and content review</strong>: Generated UI still needs to be manually reviewed and validated by designers for accessibility and content standards</li></ul><h3>Apply real data to reveal if the UI actually works</h3><p>Screens that have been generated with AI typically use mock data as placeholder content. Though mock data helps teams understand the design idea, it also masks the hardest UX problems. Not every user goes through the ideal, “happy path”…they will encounter empty states, error flows, and permission rules.</p><p><strong>These unexpected, but common scenarios don’t show up in static screens, which means early designs can give a false sense of readiness</strong>. Without real data and content driving interactions, product teams discover these gaps late in the design and development process.</p><figure><img alt=""Database feature in Anima to view and edit real data for your app"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lWxdv2nCddjR-rjiLJXFYw.png"" /><figcaption>Anima automatically creates a database with editable data to support your project</figcaption></figure><p>Though this doesn’t replace user-centered design thinking, it ensures ideas are grounded in authentic user behavior from the beginning of the design process. So by integrating real data into the generated UI, teams can see whether interactions work, content fits, and user permissions behave as expected. This is especially important when features rely on user input, authentication, or content submission.</p><h4>How to include real data with generated UI</h4><p>With the right AI tools, you can replace placeholder content for real data:</p><ul><li><strong>Anima</strong>: You or your team can describe the data a feature needs in Anima’s Playground text prompt, and the system will generate databases and/ or tables based on the instructions. The data will be connected to the project and will automatically come with <a href=""https://www.animaapp.com/blog/product-updates/built-in-databases-for-anima-playground-zero-config-backend/?ref=fmt-handpicked"">default security policies</a> that match the intended usage.</li><li><strong>Cursor</strong>: With <a href=""https://cursor.com/"">Cursor</a>, you can integrate your codebase (GitHub or GitLab) to give AI more context, as well as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfkpZzs04-I"">connect MySQL database</a> to create elements like tables.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Manually configuring a database via extension to the Cursor tool"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0XQGV9bKFQb8nVp8VgxWGQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Cursor requires manual configuration to connect a database via extension to the AI agent</em></figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: With Anima, just about anyone can create a database (even with no code knowledge). On the other hand, Cursor’s MySQL setup process is more technical and hands-on.</em></blockquote><h4>Benefits of using real data</h4><ul><li><strong>Discover problems early</strong>: Testing with real content surfaces UX gaps (like validation and edge-cases) before they become costly rework later</li><li><strong>Clear sense of readiness</strong>: When screens behave with actual data, it’s easier to know what’s ready for iteration versus what’s purely visual</li><li><strong>Reduced throwaway</strong>: By grounding UI in common behavior from the start, teams rely less on static mockups that will probably be discarded</li></ul><h4>Limits of integrating real data</h4><ul><li><strong>Developer input</strong>: Complex tables, queries, or structured data often need manual configuration beyond what AI can create</li><li><strong>Premature focus on data</strong>: Focusing on data structure before validating broader design concepts can distract from testing core user flows</li></ul><h3>Reuse and build off familiar patterns</h3><p>Many product teams rely on established UI components and patterns that AI ignores when generating screens. So teams have to rebuild or replicate familiar components, which adds unnecessary work and risks inconsistency.</p><p><strong>When screens don’t leverage existing assets or common interaction patterns, they won’t integrate with the rest of the product ecosystem</strong>. When AI can build off trusted patterns and components from the start, the generated UI becomes more durable, consistent, and easier to refine.</p><figure><img alt=""Anima’s Chrome extension lets you capture any kind of UI element on a live website"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Hp-9Z4oohRw0brznSurstQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-to-code-by-anima/paddhneaanoeljlmdepnheehdkaegblo""><em>Anima’s extension</em></a><em> lets you capture any kind of UI element on a live website, as well as manage the elements in the right rail</em></figcaption></figure><h4>How to reuse what already exists</h4><p>Tools that allow you to grab existing elements to use in your generated UI:</p><ul><li><strong>Anima</strong>: In <a href=""https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-to-code-by-anima/paddhneaanoeljlmdepnheehdkaegblo"">Anima’s Chrome extension</a>, you can capture UI components directly from live websites using the Clipboard feature.

Similar to Anima, you can mix and match your components with existing patterns.</li><li><strong>KwikUI</strong>: KwikUI has a <a href=""https://www.kwikui.com/chrome-extension"">KwikSnap Chrome extension</a> that lets you screenshot webpages to web elements. After screenshotting, you can convert the images into coding prompts within KwikUI for more context-based output.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""YoinkUI’s Chrome extension lets you select and save elements from live sites"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0yU5q6lxr8LSr21ch5-QMA.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/yoinkui/ihlkclcengelgcfkkmpkhgadepmgijkk""><em>YoinkUI’s extension</em></a><em> lets you select and save single to grouped elements from any live website, like </em><a href=""https://www.airbnb.com/""><em>Airbnb</em></a></figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: After capturing UI elements from the site of your choosing, you can select the Clipboard Gallery button in Anima Playground’s prompt to insert them into your generated screens.</em></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Insert captured elements into Anima Playground’s generated screens"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*l7uEriwp1pss7WmedPH7fA.png"" /><figcaption><em>Insert your captured elements into Anima Playground’s generated screens to recycle real UI components and patterns</em></figcaption></figure><h4>Benefits of reusing familiar patterns</h4><ul><li><strong>Faster iteration</strong>: Designers can leverage existing UI and patterns, which reduces the need to recreate components from scratch</li><li><strong>Continuity across projects</strong>: Reused components help maintain a consistent look and feel; even generated and manual UI are combined</li><li><strong>Reduced cognitive load</strong>: Familiar patterns make it easier to evaluate new screens and maintain predictable interactions (for both product teams and end users)</li></ul><h4>Limits of reusing patterns</h4><ul><li><strong>Captured UI may need adaptation</strong>: Elements from other sites may require cleanup or adjustment to fit the current project’s needs</li><li><strong>Legal and licensing</strong>: Reusing UI from external sources may require extra consideration to copyright or usage rules</li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Generated UI begins to show actual value when it holds up under real-world constraints; not simply from its delivery speed or trendiness. Brand alignment, real data, and reuse makes early concepts sturdy, reliable, and less prone to be thrown away. These 3 constraints allow product teams to continue to iterate on generated UI instead of regenerating or starting from scratch.</p><p><strong>As AI tools like Anima and Lovable continue to evolve, their progress will be shown in how usable their output is past the demo phase</strong> (rather than producing work that will be discarded). Because when AI-generated work fits into product workflows and design constraints, it will start becoming part of the product development cycle.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=96b44ade04a1"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/what-makes-generated-ui-worth-keeping-96b44ade04a1"">What makes generated UI worth keeping?</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Design principles for AI in complex systems.</h4><figure><img alt=""A painting of the Titanic Sinking"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*CN4GKLm09b9Mtmes.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Source: Artnet.com</figcaption></figure><p>Today we are at the cusp of revolutions in artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, renewable energy, and biotechnology. Each brings extraordinary promise, but each introduces more complexity, more interdependence, and more <a href=""https://www.behaviouralsafetyservices.com/Content/Downloads/Reason-Paper-Human-Error.pdf"">latent pathways to failure</a>. This elevates prudence to be critical. Good design recognizes what cannot be foreseen. It acknowledges the limits of prediction and control. It builds not merely for performance, but for recovery.</p><h4><strong>Design Not Blame</strong></h4><p>When something goes wrong, our gut reaction is to turn to the person involved. This is sometimes known as the <a href=""https://www.safetywise.com/post/latent-conditions-vs-active-failures-the-icam-investigator-s-guide-to-seeing-the-whole-picture"">active failure</a>, ascribing failure merely to the active failure is a mistake. It is a mistake that shows lack of appreciation for systems, for latent complexity, for the reality of how things fail. This reflex is a vestige of an older worldview, one in which human vigilance and effort were assumed to be the primary safeguards against failure. Now we know better.</p><p>The systems view rejects this premise entirely. A system, as we have repeated, is perfectly designed to get the results it gets. If a system produces recurring failures, the fault lies not with the operator but with the structure that shaped the operator’s choices. Good design aims not at perfect people but at ordinary people performing reliably under normal conditions.</p><p>In that spirit, good performance is not attained when we muster greater attention or exhort people to “try harder.” Rather, exceptional performance is achieved through exceptional design. Design which shapes the conditions in such a way that the correct action and the natural action are two of the same. In a well-designed system, error is eliminated not because humans have been improved, but because the system has been made incapable of producing predictable failure.</p><h4>An Integrated Philosophy of Design</h4><p>Each of the following major themes offers a distinct lens on design, but together they form a coherent blueprint.</p><h4>Latent Errors: The Why</h4><p>Latent errors teach us <em>why</em> systems fail: because latent conditions accumulate, hide, and align. The Swiss Cheese Model and <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/bad-design-is-like-a-virus-design-defects-and-latent-failures-1e0ab4be7e52"">resident pathogen metaphor</a> remind us that complexity and opaqueness invite disaster. This provides the largest, systems-focused perspective of human error and systems design. It provides the backdrop for all our design considerations.</p><figure><img alt=""Reason’s Swiss Cheese Model"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*LL8fgYaGsNyiabnP.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Source: Reason, 1997</figcaption></figure><p>Design decisions made today become the latent failures of tomorrow. Every shortcut, every unexamined assumption, every added layer of complexity is a pathogen waiting for the right conditions to cause harm.</p><h4>The Automation Paradox: The How</h4><p><a href=""https://ftp.nsjonline.com/virtual-library/Nwbza9/6GF209/the-automation-paradox.pdf"">This paradox </a>shows <em>how</em> the design and integration of automation impacts human performance and cognition. It shows that the greater trust we put on automation [any technology] the more trust we MUST put on it, for it necessarily makes the human actors even weaker. This perpetuates a vicious cycle that is not easy to extricate ourselves from.</p><p>Automation changes human capability in ways that make system failure more catastrophic. When automation works, humans deskill. When automation fails, humans cannot recover.</p><h4>Rasmussen’s Conundrum: The Where</h4><p>Jens Rasmussen reveals <em>where</em> automation excels and where it collapses. The <a href=""https://open.substack.com/pub/performancesystems/p/automation-conundrum-the-narrow-window?r=4qwh5w&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true"">Automation Conundrum</a> illustrates the narrow window of optimal performance and the importance of adaptability outside that window.</p><p>Superhuman peak performance means nothing if you cannot ensure conditions stay within the narrow range where that performance is achieved.</p><figure><img alt=""A chart showing the Rasmussen Conundrum: Automation exceeds humans in only a tightly controlled environment"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*9ZLwAj4tZJ8dic5t.png"" /><figcaption>Source: Author</figcaption></figure><h4>Together</h4><p>When combined, these frameworks yield a unified principle: Design must anticipate failure, accommodate human limitations, and employ technology in ways that extend human resilience.</p><h4>A Philosophy of Conservative Decision-Making</h4><p>Few figures embody this philosophy better than <a href=""https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/research-guides/modern-biographical-files-ndl/modern-bios-r/rickover-hyman-g.html"">Admiral Hyman G. Rickover</a>. Admiral Rickover was the first admiral of the nuclear navy. Under his leadership, the US designed and built the first nuclear submarines. Ostensively living and working next to a nuclear reactor comes with risks most people cannot fathom. Rickover recognized that catastrophic failures in complex systems seldom arise from the final, active failure. They originate as a consequence of earlier decisions. Decisions about materials, oversight, testing, assumptions, priorities. His remedy was a disciplined ethic of restraint and responsibility.</p><figure><img alt=""Admiral Rickover on the cover of Time Magazine, Jan 1954"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/0*lHB5ysPN2hJsllet.jpg"" /><figcaption>Source: Content.Time.Com</figcaption></figure><p>Rickover insisted on what he called <a href=""https://taproot.com/non-conservative-decision-making/"">conservative decision-making</a>. This meant favoring the proven over the novel, the simple over the clever, the transparent over the abstract. It also favors direct accountability over distributed blame. Rickover required engineers to understand every system they touched, to foresee how it could fail, and to take personal responsibility for its performance.</p><p>This philosophy is not opposed to innovation. It is opposed to undue confidence and corner cutting. It rejects the fantasy that more automation, more layers of protection, or more complexity can eliminate human fallibility. Instead, Rickover’s ethic aligns perfectly with Reason, and Rasmussen: The best systems are those designed with keen awareness of their limits, with clarity in how they function, and resilient in the face of the unexpected.</p><h4>Design and AI</h4><p>Nowhere are the principles of good design more urgently needed than in systems that incorporate artificial intelligence. AI is not merely another automation layer; it is a new kind of agent inside our systems — opaque, statistical, fast, and prone to unfamiliar <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/failure-mode"">failure modes</a>. It makes predictions rather than following instructions, and its logic is embedded in inscrutable data patterns rather than explicit rules. All of this magnifies the challenges highlighted by Reason, Rasmussen, and Rickover.</p><h4>AI Accumulates Latent Failures</h4><p>AI systems, by their very nature, accumulate latent failures. They learn from datasets we did not fully inspect, absorb correlations we did not intend, and behave in ways that are not visible or understandable from the outside. A model might perform flawlessly for months before a quiet change in data distribution causes an abrupt collapse.</p><p>This is Reason’s “resident pathogens” writ large: dormant vulnerabilities that lie hidden until the right alignment triggers failure. Every training decision, every data preprocessing choice, every architecture selection, every hyperparameter is a potential pathogen. And unlike traditional software where we can inspect the logic, AI embeds these decisions in millions of parameters that no human can comprehend.</p><p>The problem is compounded because:</p><ul><li>Training data is never complete or representative</li><li>Correlations learned may be spurious</li><li>Performance on training data doesn’t guarantee real-world performance</li><li>Models drift as real-world conditions change</li><li>Failure modes are unpredictable and emergent</li></ul><h4>AI Erodes Human-Centered Design</h4><p>AI erodes the very foundations of <a href=""https://medium.com/dc-design/what-is-human-centered-design-6711c09e2779"">human-centered design</a>. Visibility, mapping, and feedback weaken when decisions emerge from statistical inference. Users cannot form an accurate mental model of a system when its internal logic is fundamentally opaque.</p><p>A well-designed traditional system has clear cause-and-effect relationships. You turn the dial, the temperature changes. You press the button, the action occurs. You can build a mental model of how it works and predict what will happen.</p><p>AI systems break this clarity. You provide input, you get output, but the relationship between them is inscrutable. Why did the AI make this recommendation? What factors did it consider? What would happen if conditions changed? These questions often have no satisfying answers.</p><p>A well-designed AI system must restore visibility through explanations, constraints, and clear domain limits so that human operators understand not just what the AI chose, but why and under what assumptions. This means:</p><ul><li>Clear communication of confidence levels</li><li>Explanation of key factors in decisions</li><li>Explicit boundaries of competence</li><li>Graceful degradation when uncertain</li><li>Human-understandable reasoning paths</li></ul><h4>AI Intensifies the Automation Paradox</h4><p>Rasmussen’s automation conundrum becomes particularly acute with AI. AI excels in routine, predictable environments but breaks sharply at the edges. This is especially manifest in <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14859"">instances where people are deliberately trying to break AI</a>. When conditions drift or the unexpected occurs, AI systems fail in ways that human operators are least prepared to correct. Meanwhile, human skill declines as more decision-making is delegated to the machine.</p><figure><img alt=""A sketch explaining the automation paradox. Reliance on technology leads to fast, unexpected failures"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*BC598V3Egz_dPzvq"" /><figcaption>Source: Sketchplanations.com</figcaption></figure><p>The result is a brittle system which may be high-performing on ordinary days, but extremely volatile and vulnerable on extraordinary ones.</p><p>But AI makes this worse than traditional automation because:</p><ul><li>AI failure modes are less predictable (it doesn’t just stop working; it confidently produces wrong answers)</li><li>AI operates in domains requiring judgment (not just mechanical tasks)</li><li>AI deskills faster (it handles tasks humans used to do cognitively, not just physically)</li><li>Recovery is harder (humans may not recognize AI errors without domain expertise)</li></ul><h4>AI Demands Conservative Decision-Making</h4><p>Rickover’s philosophy offers the necessary counterweight. Conservative decision-making demands restraint: use AI where it is appropriate, proven, and transparent, not merely where it is impressive.</p><p>This means:</p><ul><li>Favor smaller, interpretable models over unnecessarily complex ones</li><li>Limit autonomy in high-stakes domains</li><li>Maintain human accountability for every decision the system makes</li><li>Require understanding of failure modes before deployment</li><li>Choose proven approaches over novel ones</li><li>Insist on transparency in how decisions are made</li></ul><p>In Rickover’s world, responsibility cannot be delegated to software. Someone must always “sign their name.” This echos a popular meme going around allegedly showing a memo from IBM in the 1970s. “A computer can never be held accountable…Therefore a computer must never make a management decision. This principle becomes even more critical with AI, where the temptation is to let the algorithm decide without human oversight let alone accountability.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/687/0*TJuzJ5y0jw9vqYOL"" /></figure><h4>Practical Philosophy for AI Design</h4><p>Taken together, these perspectives form a coherent philosophy for AI design. AI does not require us to reinvent the principles of good design. It requires us to apply them more rigorously than ever before.</p><h4>1. Assume AI Will Fail</h4><p>Design systems assuming AI will fail, not assuming it will work. This means:</p><ul><li>Clear handoff protocols when AI reaches its limits</li><li>Human oversight for critical decisions</li><li>Fallback mechanisms that don’t depend on AI</li><li>Monitoring for distribution drift and performance degradation</li><li>Regular testing outside the training distribution</li></ul><h4>2. Preserve Human Capability</h4><p>Don’t allow AI to completely deskill human operators. This means:</p><ul><li>Keeping humans in the loop for critical decisions</li><li>Requiring periodic manual operation of tasks</li><li>Training for exceptions, not just normal operation</li><li>Maintaining domain expertise even when AI handles routine cases</li></ul><h4>3. Demand Transparency</h4><p>Insist on explainable AI for any consequential application. This means:</p><ul><li>Understanding what factors influence decisions</li><li>Knowing the confidence level of predictions</li><li>Recognizing when the AI is operating outside its competence</li><li>Being able to audit decisions after the fact</li></ul><h4>4. Define Clear Boundaries</h4><p>Explicitly define where AI should and shouldn’t be used. This means:</p><ul><li>Clear specifications of the optimal design domain</li><li>Hard limits on autonomy in high-stakes situations</li><li>Explicit human authority for final decisions</li><li>Recognition that some tasks should never be fully automated</li></ul><h4>5. Design for Recovery</h4><p>Plan for what happens when AI fails, not just how it performs when it works. This means:</p><ul><li>Clear error <a href=""https://pdhacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Detection-of-Errors-Course-for-Website.pdf"">detection and signaling</a></li><li>Graceful degradation rather than catastrophic failure</li><li>Human-understandable system states</li><li>Recovery protocols that don’t require AI expertise</li></ul><h4>6. Take Responsibility</h4><p>Maintain human accountability for AI-made decisions. This means:</p><ul><li>Someone is responsible for every consequential decision</li><li>Regular review of AI performance and errors</li><li>Willingness to roll back AI when it underperforms</li><li>Ethical guidelines that don’t hide behind algorithmic decisions</li></ul><h4>A Warning Circa 1990</h4><p>In 1990, James Reason warned of grave technological dangers:</p><blockquote><em>“A point has been reached in the development of technology where the greatest dangers stem not so much from the breakdown of a major component or from isolated operator errors, as from the insidious accumulation of delayed-action human failures occurring primarily within the organizational and managerial sectors.”</em></blockquote><p>If that was true in an age where the internet was still ascendent, TV the dominant form of entertainment, and phones and computers still geographically bound to the office and the home, it is exponentially more true today. Inscrutable design is a ticking time bomb for failure. AI has merely made that opacity more common, almost necessary.</p><figure><img alt=""An old, inscrutable nuclear control panel"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/793/0*7J2808IyNreqs36_.png"" /><figcaption>Source: Taproot.com</figcaption></figure><p>The proliferation of software layers, automated decision-making, globalized workflows, and complex interdependencies has increased both the number of resident pathogens and the difficulty of detecting them. Many failures today arise not from dramatic mistakes but from quiet misalignments: an assumption not documented, a procedure not updated, a dataset not validated, a safeguard added without understanding what it hides.</p><h4>The Designer’s New Responsibility</h4><p>Designers, therefore, inherit a new responsibility. Their task is not merely to make systems functional or efficient, but to make them <em>understandable</em>. To build systems with fewer hidden couplings. To reduce opacity. To create clear cause-effect relationships. To design for transparency, resilience, and recovery.</p><p>This responsibility extends beyond engineering. Latent errors emerge from management decisions, organizational cultures, incentives, and expectations. The designer cannot control every upstream choice, but the designer can insist upon principles like simplicity, clarity, conservatism, recoverability that reduce the accumulation of resident pathogens.</p><h4>Designing for Latent Complexity</h4><p>The imperative is one of prudence, not perfection. Good design recognizes what cannot be foreseen. It acknowledges the limits of prediction and control. It builds not merely for performance, but for recovery.</p><p>A system designed in this spirit can:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://diptendud.medium.com/understanding-resilience-in-system-design-5f4886eb8ad9"">Endure shocks without catastrophic failure</a></li><li>Adapt to inevitable new conditions and applications</li><li>Avoid the catastrophic alignment of latent failures</li><li>Preserve human agency without depending on individual heroism</li><li>Use technology without succumbing to its arrogance</li></ul><p>Such systems are not just safer. They are more humane, more comprehensible, and ultimately more worthy of the trust we place in them.</p><h4>The Path Forward</h4><p>The future of design, especially in the age of AI, requires us to hold two truths simultaneously:</p><p>First, technology, including AI, offers <a href=""https://www.online.uc.edu/blog/artificial-intelligence-ai-benefits.html"">genuine benefits</a>. It can enhance human capability, reduce errors in routine tasks, reveal patterns we couldn’t see, and free us from tedious work.</p><p>Second, technology, especially AI, introduces new failure modes, new latent errors, new paradoxes that make systems more fragile precisely when they appear most capable.</p><p>The solution is not to reject technology but to deploy it with wisdom inherited from generations of <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915002860"">systems thinking</a>, <a href=""https://www.hfes.org/"">human factors</a> research, and hard-won lessons from failures.</p><p>This means:</p><ul><li>Designing with awareness of latent failures</li><li>Understanding the paradox of automation</li><li>Respecting the conundrum of narrow performance windows</li><li>Applying conservative decision-making</li><li>Maintaining human <a href=""https://infusedinnovations.com/blog/responsible-ai-accountability"">accountability</a></li><li>Building for recovery, not just performance</li></ul><p>The designer’s task is not only to create intelligent systems, but to ensure those systems remain understandable, bounded, recoverable, and responsible. AI magnifies both the power of good design and the consequences of poor design. It is the ultimate test of our ability to design systems that align with human judgment, human values, and human limits.</p><p>The stakes have never been higher. The principles have never been clearer. The question is whether we have the wisdom and restraint to apply them before the next catastrophic failure forces us to learn these lessons again, at a cost we can ill afford.</p><p>The future of design is not about making systems smarter. It’s about making systems wiser. Systems that know their limits, acknowledge their failures, and preserve the human capabilities that technology promises to enhance but often erodes.</p><p>That is the philosophy we must carry forward into an age where artificial intelligence will touch nearly every aspect of our lives. The question is not whether AI will be powerful but whether we will be wise enough to design it responsibly.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=cc6733aedcfa"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/against-cleverness-cc6733aedcfa"">Against cleverness</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955752.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=732&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=256%3A183"" /><figcaption>Digital illustration of the universe and galaxies</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Elusive and empathetic Neptune is re-entering <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/january-monthly-horoscope-2026-meanings-effects"">Aries on January 26th</a>, offering us a second chance to understand the journey ahead. This time around, we’ll go full throttle in Aries to find our path until March 2039. The nearly 14-year transit is augmenting the world and our lives. </p>



<p>To understand how transit affects us, it’s essential to look to the past to gain a clearer perspective. When Neptune was previously in Aries, we’ve seen reformation, uprisings, and advancements in society, particularly in the medical and scientific fields. Empires have risen, and others have fallen in history when <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/neptune-in-aries-horoscope-march-2025-meaning-effects"">Neptune has been in Aries</a>. To sum it up, the good comes with its challenges — that is how Neptune rolls.  </p>



<p>Last year, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/neptune-in-aries-horoscope-march-2025-meaning-effects"">Neptune made a quick entrance into Arie</a>s from March 30th to October 22nd, then moonwalked back into Pisces.  In questionable times, people have sometimes turned to mysticism to give them a sense of control and order amidst the political chaos. Spiritual Neptune urges us to take action to change our lives by any means possible. We can expect more magic until 2039. </p>



<p>One of the most important astrological transits of the year occurs on February 20th, when Neptune and Saturn link up in Aries. This planetary connection is set to bring sweeping changes to the collective, ushering in a new state of mind. A new era of creativity, innovation, and societal transformation is unfolding. The 1989 Neptune and Saturn conjunction in Sagittarius coincided with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the onset of the Velvet Revolution. Although the alignment of these two celestial entities occurs approximately every 36 years, it has been centuries since they last came together in Aries. The once-in-a-lifetime alignment of Neptune and Saturn in Aries is making our dreams a reality, as long as we approach our progress with pragmatism and remain committed to the cause.  </p>



<p>Take note: July is going to be a stellar month for Neptune in Aries! Neptune and Uranus in Gemini harmonize on July 15th, changing the way we communicate with others. Neptune and Jupiter in Leo gently touch each other on July 20th, enhancing our compassion and artistry. Neptune and Pluto in Aquarius spark each other up on July 25th, rebirthing our ideology with novel perspectives. We’ll use our voice to fight authoritative forces and trust our intuition to guide us through challenging situations and choices.  </p>



<p>The following 13 years are going to intensify the effects of Neptune in Aries. But 2026 is going to bring us into a higher state of consciousness. We have until 2039 to figure out our next steps. For now, we must prioritize ourselves. We hold the ultimate power over our own success. Don’t forget that! </p>

<p>As far as classic accents go, tiny red or pink hearts make for a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/iced-coffee-glass-nails-manicure-trend"">fun manicure</a> any time of year, not just the first week of February. But seeing as we’re heading into <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/valentines-day"">Valentine’s Day</a> season, we have a few ideas to level it up.</p>



<p>Our <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nail-manicure-trends-2026"">favorite manicures of the moment</a> are loosely inspired by Cupid, flowers, and all things love. But just like the poppy-red Sezane cardigan in your wardrobe, these nail looks are timeless and a little flirty. </p>



<p>From a glossy black manicure with heart details to kitschy coquette nails, we’ve compiled the coolest Valentine’s Day <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-nail-manicure-trends-2025"">nail art</a> ahead.</p>

<p>Having <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/combination-imbalanced-skincare-routine"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">combination skin</a> is like bringing all your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/one-on-one-friendship-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">different friendship groups</a> together on your birthday — but instead of enjoying yourself on the karaoke machine, you’re making sure they get along. Keeping every personality happy at once is no easy feat, and the same goes for managing two <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/double-cleansing-routine-skin-type"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">skin types</a>. In my experience, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-moisturizer-for-dry-skin"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">moisturizers for dry skin</a> tend to be unctuously thick, which can trigger breakouts, while those made for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-sunscreen-spf-oily-skin"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">oily skin</a> are often too light to make a difference. So when I find a product that does it all — quenching dry patches and delivering hydration without a greasy feel — I have to shout about it. Enter: <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Frice-lipids-ectoin-microemulsion-moisturizer-100739.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary’s new Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion</a>. </p>



<h2>What is The Ordinary’s Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion, and what are the benefits? </h2>



<p>Don’t be fooled by <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Frice-lipids-ectoin-microemulsion-moisturizer-100739.html"">Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion</a>. At first glance, it looks like one of the brand’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-multi-antioxidant-radiance-serum-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">many serums</a>, and while it boasts a lightweight, milky consistency and comes in a dropper bottle, this product is actually a moisturizer. </p>



<p>The Ordinary drew inspiration <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/belif-korean-skincare-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">from K-beauty</a>, specifically milky skincare textures, when developing this moisturizer, and its star ingredient — rice lipids — also nods to Eastern beauty rituals. You might be familiar with rice water in skincare, but lipids are a little different. NYC-based dermatologist <a href=""https://www.zeichnerdermatology.com/"">Joshua Zeichner, MD</a>, explains, “Rice lipids are natural fats derived from the outer layer of the rice grain known as the bran, and they have emollient benefits.” This, adds Dr. Zeichner, means they “fill in cracks” between cells on the surface of the skin. As a result, Dr. Zeichner explains that rice lipids can soften the outer skin layer, or what is known as the skin barrier.  </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Frice-lipids-ectoin-microemulsion-moisturizer-100739.html"">The Ordinary’s Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion, $13</a></h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955647.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>There’s also <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-inkey-list-ectoin-hydro-barrier-serum-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ectoin, a skincare ingredient</a> that’s finally getting its dues in skincare. “Ectoin is a naturally derived compound that helps maintain a healthy skin barrier and protects skin from the environment,” says Dr. Zeichner. He adds that it’s naturally found in bacteria that live in extreme conditions, helping those bacteria to survive. “In skincare, it improves hydration and provides antioxidant benefits to prevent inflammation,” continues Dr. Zeichner. If your skin feels rough, flaky, or tight after cleansing, then ectoin is for you. Even better? It has a soothing effect on inflamed skin, and over time, it can help improve uneven skin texture.  </p>



<p>For the ingredient buffs, hydrating electrolyte molecules and amino acids — the building blocks of skin-strengthening proteins — are also present in this milky moisturizer. These are both present in the skin anyway, but sometimes our reserves run low, resulting in dry skin. But there’s good news: “These ingredients have been replicated and used in skincare products,” says Dr. Zeichner, “and they pull hydration into the skin.” As someone currently using <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">high-strength retinol</a> and really feeling the effects of cold weather and central heating, this sounded right up my alley. </p>



<h2>What makes The Ordinary’s Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion special? </h2>



<p>Lightweight moisturizers can be hit or miss. In fact, my bathroom cabinet is lined with gel-cream products that keep my oily T-zone happy but just don’t cut it on my dry patches, so I slotted this into my routine the day it landed at my door — and I’m so glad I did.  </p>



<p>I started using it after ditching a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/01/10846449/exfoliating-acids-skin-benefits-risks"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">high-strength acid</a> that wrecked my skin barrier, and within just a couple of days, my skin had already recovered. It was less red and angry; the dry skin around my mouth had disappeared, and there was a subtle dewy sheen that meant I didn’t want to wear as much foundation. I ended up dropping my thicker moisturizer and shelving my hydrating serum, too, because this does it all. I even take it up to my eyes and use it as an eye cream — it’s that moisturizing. </p>



<p>Besides the powerhouse ingredients, how the moisturizer is made is pretty special. Without boring you with the science, the formula goes through microfluidization, a high-pressure mixing technique that blends light, water-based ingredients with slightly heavier, oil-based ones. The result? A lightweight, comfortable moisturizer that absorbs quickly but is substantial enough to hydrate even dry skin. </p>



<h2>What to know about The Ordinary’s Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion </h2>



<p>• Reduces visible skin redness after one use. </p>



<p>• Provides hydration for up to 24 hours and repairs a weakened skin barrier. </p>



<p>• Can be used in the morning and evening and comes in 60ml and 120ml bottles. </p>



<h2>How do you use The Ordinary’s Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion, and is it worth it? </h2>



<p>My skincare routine is pretty simple. In the morning, I wash my face with a cream cleanser, apply a pipette-full of <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Frice-lipids-ectoin-microemulsion-moisturizer-100739.html"">Rice Lipids + Ectoin</a>, then finish with three finger lengths of sunscreen. In the evening, I double cleanse to remove all traces of makeup and sunscreen, apply Rice Lipids + Ectoin, and finish with my retinal serum. I find that, even though this moisturizer is featherlight, it provides a nice cushion for retinoids and helps reduce irritation and flaky patches of skin. </p>



<p>Because it’s such an all-rounder, I’ve happily and easily recommended it to anyone looking for a simple moisturizer that transcends seasons. While it’s working wonders on my skin this winter, it’ll be just as brilliant come spring and summer, thanks to its quenching feel and lack of any slippery residue. Better still, a 60ml bottle is only $13. If you love it as much as me, you grab the 120ml bottle, which is $22.50.  </p>



<h2>Where can you get The Ordinary’s Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion? </h2>

<p>“Every January, L’Oréal unveils a mascara to rival the previous year’s, and I’m convinced it’s impossible to beat the last one — but I’m always proven wrong. Big Deal is a serious upgrade on the Panorama Mascara, which scooped the top spot in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-beauty-products-2024-innovator-awards"">2024’s Beauty Innovator Awards roundup</a>, and I’ve barely gone a day without it. Most mascaras are too wet on the first swipe, but this one is perfect from the get-go. The springy, conic brush boasts two types of bristles to capture and thicken lashes in one swipe, and you’ll be pleasantly surprised by how easily it slips on. Just like its predecessor, it stays put until you decide to remove it at the end of the day. Smudges? Where?!” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“My bathroom cabinet is lined with oils promising growth, shine, and 101 other benefits, but this is the one I always come back to — and the only oil I actually finished last year. I run a quarter of a pipette through towel-dried hair before blow-drying, and it leaves my hair shinier, softer, and healthier, without even a hint of heaviness. That’s thanks to glycolic acid, which smooths the hair cuticle to reduce frizz, plus hydrating hyaluronic acid suspended in a nourishing yet lightweight oil base. When I skip it, I really notice the difference. Even better, the subtle rose and sandalwood notes mean it doubles as a hair perfume.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“I’ve never met a heat protectant that didn’t make my hair feel greasy and look dull — until this. While it’s deeply conditioning thanks to a blend of plant oils and strand-strengthening proteins, it offers lightweight heat protection up to an impressive 450°F. I use it knowing it shields my hair from my flat iron without ever weighing it down, even if I accidentally apply too much. I recently gave a bottle to my mom, who has very dry, bleached blonde hair and usually relies on Olaplex, and she hasn’t stopped raving about how soft it leaves her hair — and how much easier it is to style. She’s a total convert.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“This no-frills cleanser is the skincare product I bought most in 2025. It feels like a lightweight lotion but transforms on contact with water into a silky milk that dislodges mascara and melts foundation, all without leaving skin feeling stripped or tight. The star ingredient is 5% rice milk, a key component in many dew-giving Korean skincare products, along with hydrating hyaluronic acid and ultra-moisturizing glycerin. It does the job of an expensive cleanser at a fraction of the price, and it’s so quick I no longer dread washing my face at night. That’s no small feat!” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“If you’ve asked me on any given day what lipstick I was wearing last fall, it was almost certainly this one. I usually never wear matte liquid lipsticks, and for a few reasons: Too many of them are uncomfortably dry, go on patchy, or migrate at first bite or sip. I was already a fan of <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.violettefr.com%2Fproducts%2Fpetal-bouche-amour-fou%3Fvariant%3D43587553755325"">Violette_FR’s iconic Petal Bouche</a> matte liquid lipstick, but its newer addition, Plume Lip, is even better. It has the most incredible whipped texture that effortlessly glides onto lips, and doesn’t feel like dry cement once it sets. I audibly gasped after I swatched the rosy brown Châtaigne Grillée (aka my new go-to for everyday wear) — <em>that’s </em>how stunning she is IRL. Because I’m in my soft girl era, I’m especially loving Plume Lip’s diffused, blurred finish, which is just so pretty and romantic.” <em>— Karina Hoshikawa, senior beauty writer.</em></p>

(This, said by a girl who keeps a Juicy Tubes in every bag.) I’m convinced the magic is in the hydrating, naturally plumping benefits, thanks to the squalane-packed formula. Any gloss can sit atop lips with a shiny finish, but true ‘juiciness’ comes from lips that are soft and nourished, then made even better by gloss. No notes — just more shades in 2026, please!” <em>— Karina Hoshikawa, senior beauty writer.</em></p>

<p>“I’ve lost count of how many blushes — from pressed powders to creams — landed on my desk in 2025, but this is the only one I used consistently. It’s a chunky product, so you only need a single swipe, and it has a subtle iridescence that makes my skin look alive.

<p>“I recently donated a foot of my hair, and while I love my new bob, the styling learning curve is real. For days when I don’t feel like using a curling iron to enhance my natural waves, I’ve been using mousse as an easy air-dry hack, and my favorite from recent history is, without a doubt, Crown Affair’s Texturizing Air Dry Mousse. It’s easily the most sophisticated mousse I’ve ever tried, and I’m convinced it’s the closest thing to what clouds must feel like. The weightlessness, airy foam has none of the crunch I knew (and hated) from back in the day, and the soft scent (Crown Affair’s signature blend of bergamot, yuzu, and lemongrass) is clean and refreshing. I finger-comb three or four pumps of the stuff into damp strands and watch as my hair air-dries in soft, tousled waves with just the right amount of bounce.” <em>— Karina Hoshikawa, senior beauty writer.</em></p>

Designed in tandem with the brand’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/olive-june-gel-system-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">existing DIY gel system</a>, Olive &amp; June’s Builder Gel polishes (retailing for $12 each) are thicker in texture than traditional gel polish, creating a strong, supportive barrier to help grow your natural nails.

<p>“Last June, I called this the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/elf-halo-glow-skin-tint-spf-50-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">best skin tint</a> for people with olive skin, and I stand by it — I’ve been using it ever since. I’ve tried multiple high-end skin tints and foundations over the past year, but I always come back to this one. It’s more substantial than other tints I’ve tried, yet the coverage is perfect — not too thick, but pigmented enough to blur dark circles and acne marks. It blends in seconds, leaves my skin looking healthy and radiant, <em>and</em> has mineral protection in the form of SPF 50.

Cosmetics’ Halo Glow Skin Tint</a> was my go-to for most of last year, besting several formulas (including those double the price) in my extensive collection. Nothing I’ve tried (and I’ve tried what feels like hundreds) compares to its lightweight hydration and sheer veil of coverage. (Added SPF 50 is a welcome bonus, even if it doesn’t replace sunscreen as a separate step — say it with me!) I also want to shoutout the niacinamide and bisabol in the formula, two ingredients that my notoriously breakout-prone skin loves. Anything with ‘glow’ in the name tends not to suit my oily complexion, but Halo Glow actually has a wearable, not greasy, finish that genuinely looks like you don’t have makeup on. Between this and the brand’s beloved <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fpower-grip-primer-pimprod2030073%3Fsku%3D2591795"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Power Grip Primer</a> (another personal go-to of mine), I’m racking up e.l.f. faves like Infinity Stones — and don’t plan on slowing down anytime soon.” <em>— Karina Hoshikawa, senior beauty writer.</em></p>

Waving hair can feel like a chore, but this lets me take bigger sections and finish in half the time.

One swipe delivers a sheer wash of color, and while it feels like a lip gloss at first, it dries down to a comfortable, moisturizing balm that leaves my usually parched lips feeling soothed and soft. That’ll be the shea butter and plant oils. I’m convinced the subtle shimmer makes my lips look more plump.

<p>“I’ve really put this hairspray through its paces. The first time I used it was before a 10-hour flight that turned into a 24-hour travel day thanks to delays. Even though I slept in it, my waves didn’t budge an inch — so much so that my travel companions were convinced I’d packed a portable curling iron and redone my hair in the airport bathroom.

Think peptides that help preserve the skin’s collagen reserves, keeping it soft and supple; polyglutamic acid, which hydrates far more deeply than hyaluronic acid; and growth factors to further support collagen and elastin, the two key proteins that give skin structure and help prevent fine lines.

<p>“I am notoriously low maintenance when it comes to hair products: Literally, I’m a shampoo, condition, <em>maybe </em>a hair oil once I’m out of the shower, and that’s it. IGK’s original Good Behavior Smoothing Spray is one of the rare stylers I actually use — nothing else has compared to its keratin treatment-like properties on my thick, frizz-prone waves. The latest addition to the Good Behavior cinematic universe — Good Behavior Flexible Anti Frizz Hairspray — combines the smoothing, multi-day frizz shield of the OG with the flexible, touchable hold that’s nothing like the sticky, stiff hairspray of yore. In other words, it’s my dream product for light hold and frizz-fighting, shine-enhancing benefits. Whatever 2026 brings, I know my hair is going to be ready for it all, thanks to this multitasker.” <em>— Karina Hoshikawa, senior beauty writer.</em></p>

<p>“This is the serum that convinced me to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-multi-antioxidant-radiance-serum-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ditch foundation</a> for a while — it’s that good. It’s filled to bursting with antioxidants, which create a forcefield around the skin, protecting it from environmental aggressors like pollution and UV, which can dull, clog, and age skin. The star ingredient is ascorbyl glycoside, a gentler form of vitamin C that brightens without irritation. It absorbs in seconds and gives my skin a dewy radiance unlike any other serum I’ve tried. The best part? It doesn’t break the bank.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“I’ve been a ZIIP devotee ever since getting a facial from founder Melanie Simon several years ago; I’ll never forget seeing my skin visibly lifted and brighter after one session with her, and continued to use the brand’s hero product, the Halo, to help tone facial muscles, address uneven tone, and treat breakouts — that’s right, it does it all, thanks to the power of nano- and microcurrent. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ziip-dot-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ZIIP’s latest device, the Dot</a>, brings the same technology in a palm-sized, acne-focused tool that retails for half of the Halo. Within weeks of regular use (I alternate every other day), I noticed fewer acne and clogged pores, and brighter, more radiant skin to boot. (I’ve found that it’s especially effective at targeting cystic acne, which is notoriously hard to treat with topicals alone.) All in all, if you’re looking to boost your acne skincare routine, I can’t think of a better addition to your arsenal.” <em>— Karina Hoshikawa, senior beauty writer.</em></p>

<p>“When this launched, it was the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tatcha-dewy-milk-moisturizer-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">talk of our editor Slack channel</a>. I love Tatcha’s original Dewy Moisturizer, but my skin adores this lightweight version even more — so much so that I’ve gone through two bottles in the past year. That’s saying something considering how many moisturizers I need to try for my job. While it’s thinner than its original counterpart, it still delivers a hydrating punch. And the dew? Unrivaled.

<p>“I loved this fragrance so much that I wore it on my wedding day last year. (It is now stored in a cool, dark room so I can treasure it forever.) The crisp mix of citrus, white florals, and musk is undeniably romantic, but not super girly or feminine. At first spritz, the bright bergamot and orange blossom are invigorating and clean, but as the scent dries down, I pick up on the lingering floral notes left behind. (This is also a scent that will stay for hours, from getting-ready to dancing the night away.) As the name suggests, it’s an olfactive interpretation of snowy slopes and the cozy appeal of <em>après-ski </em>— fitting as we said ‘I do’ at our favorite ski mountain.” <em>— Karina Hoshikawa, senior beauty writer.</em></p>

From shielding skin from dry, cold weather to strengthening the skin barrier, proper hydration and moisture (which are two different things, both important: In layman's terms, hydration is more surface-level, lending an immediate softening, plumping effect to skin, while moisturizing locks in hydration via oils/butters to prevent evaporation.) is an essential step in your routine, and one worth investing in.<br /><br />I personally learned (the hard way, might I add) that neglecting moisturizer is honestly, one of the worst things you can do to your skin. As an acne-prone gal, I spent more years than I'd care to admit robbing my face of hydration in the hopes it would curb my breakouts, when in reality, it only exacerbated them since my sebum production skyrocketed as a result of dehydration.<br /><br />As beauty editors, we test hundreds of moisturizers a year, and as such, know a thing or two about the ones that actually work and the ones worth skipping. Ahead, the 12 best moisturizers for dry skin that really quenched our thirst.<br /><br /><em>At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.

For starters, it’s thick — probably the most dense I’ve tried. But it delivers instant, long-lasting relief for very dry, flaky skin, with results that last for hours. When I use it at night, I wake up to skin that looks and feels brand new. That’s thanks to squalane, a humectant that draws moisture into the skin, alongside skin-smoothing ceramides, hydrating niacinamide and cholesterol — a natural lipid that helps repair and maintain the skin barrier, keeping moisture in and bacteria out. The most interesting thing about this moisturizer, though, is the way it dispenses: it comes out like whipped cream.

First up are ceramides, which act like glue between skin cells, keeping skin soft and healthy rather than rough and flaky. Then there’s shea butter, which dermatologists praise for its deeply moisturizing properties, alongside glycerin. Glycerin is both a humectant  (meaning it draws moisture into the skin) and an emollient, helping to keep that moisture locked in. Even though it’s a souped-up moisturizer, it never breaks me out.

Whenever I ask them for product recommendations — whether it’s the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"">best retinol serum</a> or the right <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/sunscreen-spf-on-airplane-flights"">sunscreen to wear on a plane</a> — one brand invariably gets lots of love: <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.laroche-posay.us%2F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">La Roche-Posay</a>.</p>



<p>The French skincare brand, which recently turned 50 years old, will likely already sound familiar if you’re a fan of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/drugstore-beauty-products"">drugstore beauty</a>. Its hero products have gone viral many times over, in particular the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fcicaplast-balm-b5-soothing-therapeutic-multi-purpose-cream-pimprod2018263%3Fsku%3D2570171"">Cicaplast Balm B5</a>, which has racked up <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/discover/cicaplast-baume-b5?lang=en"">millions of views on TikTok</a> for its myriad uses, mainly to aid skin repair and hydration.</p>



<p>But all this immense social media hype isn’t merely skin deep. La Roche-Posay is a leading brand in <a href=""https://www.lorealprofessionalskincare.com/lrp/clinical-studies"">research on the microbiome</a>, aka the trillions of microorganisms (think friendly bacteria, fungi, and so much more) that make up the largest organ of the body — the skin. What’s more, most of its product range contains thermal spring water sourced from La Roche-Posay, an actual place in France, which is rich in minerals that have calming and soothing benefits for the skin.</p>



<p>Don’t just take our word for it. Ahead, we’ve asked leading dermatologists to share their favorite La Roche-Posay products and what they’d recommend to patients with various skin concerns.</p>

<p>“I love this stuff and have multiple tubes of it all over my house. It contains soothing shea butter, madecassoside [an ingredient derived from centella asiatica, also known as cica, an herb with soothing, anti-inflammatory, and healing properties]. There’s also <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vitamin-b5-hyaluronic-acid-serum-combination"">panthenol (vitamin B5)</a>, which has moisturizing and hydration-boosting benefits.

<p>“This mist is a great product to keep in the bathroom. It moistens the skin before you apply lotion, which helps lock in hydration. The water comes from the thermal springs in La Roche-Posay, France, and is rich in minerals like selenium and calcium, which calm the skin. In the summer, I like to keep this in the fridge and use it as a cooling mist when I’m about to step out of the house (make sure you’re wearing water-resistant sunscreen, though). You can also put it in a cooler bag and keep it in your car to spray on your body when you’re overheated.” <em>— <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/brownskinderm/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Adeline Kikam</a>, MD, board-certified dermatologist</em></p>

<p>“For my patients with atopic dermatitis, eczema, and dry skin, I always recommend the Lipikar AP+M Cream.

<p>“I often recommend this serum to women of color, who are predisposed to hyperpigmentation. It <a href=""https://www.laroche-posay.us/melasyl.html"">features Melasyl</a>, a proprietary ingredient that actively targets discoloration. It’s all about prevention: Melasyl blocks the precursors to melanin, effectively stopping the formation of increased pigment in the skin, so you don’t even get the discoloration. For patients prone to hyperpigmentation when getting a chemical peel or microdermal abrasion, I put them on this serum for two to four weeks prior [as hyperpigmentation can be a <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3560165/"">side effect</a> after the procedure]. The serum also contains 10% <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/niacinamide-for-skin"">niacinamide (or vitamin B3)</a>, which helps with hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone.

<p>“I live in Colorado, and many of my patients struggle with dry skin. They’d moisturize with lotions and tell me that their skin still feels really dry. In a lot of cases, they are actually using the wrong body wash. The easiest thing I’d recommend is switching to this shower oil, since it moisturizes while cleansing the skin. The formula is oil-based, so it gives you that extra moisture boost before you even exit the shower and put on body cream. This is a foaming oil, so it lathers up and is great at taking off makeup, dirt, and removing impurities.” <em>— <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/denverskindoc"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Scott Walter,</a> MD, board-certified dermatologist</em></p>

<p>Winter jackets are practical, but the best ones aren’t a supporting act — they’re the main character, serving as <em>the</em> outfit. That’s why we’re all about layering up in outerwear that delivers warmth and <em>wow</em> factor. Whether you’re leaning into the coziness of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-faux-fur-coats-jackets"">faux-fur coat</a> or the versatility of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/womens-fall-jackets"">trench coat</a>, the right winter topper can transform even the simplest look into a moment. <br /><br />This season, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-dresses-for-women"">top winter trends</a> point towards bold plaids (or even more dramatic checks), animal print (yes, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-leopard-print-2"">leopard print</a> is always in fashion), and winter whites (to channel Pantone’s Color of the Year: Cloud Dancer). And for silhouettes, it’s time to pull out your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cape-coats-jackets-trend"">scarf jackets</a> from a couple of seasons back (or invest in a new one) and bundle up in funnel-neck designs (that don’t require a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/oversized-scarf"">chunky scarf</a>). <br /><br />Whether you’re looking for an elevated coat to wear over <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-wedding-guest-dresses-outfits"">winter wedding guest dresses</a> or a cozy cropped jacket to pair with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-matching-sweatsuits-womens"">lounge sets</a>, you can brave the cold in style.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Plaid Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952061.png?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The winter calls for festive plaids, especially on your outerwear. This season, the closet mainstay is refreshed with punchier colors and unexpected silhouettes. Think: vibrant color combos, blazers, and bomber jackets. We’re especially eyeing reversible jacket designs that can transform with different outfits and seasons. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Scarf Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952078.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>It seems like every It-girl on our feeds and on the streets is wearing a scarf coat. The bundled-up silhouette trended a couple of years back — briefly overtaken by the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cape-coats-jackets-trend"">cape jacket</a> — and is back at the forefront. Wear the scarves loosely hanging down or wrapped snugly around your neck (and be sure to also look out for coats with detachable scarves). </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Winter White Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952100.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>A winter essential that’s equal parts cozy and cool, a white coat should be in your closet (or in your shopping cart), especially thanks to Pantone’s Cloud Dancer color and the trending <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hm-perfect-moment-collaboration"">après-ski aesthetic</a>. The best part is that you can go down any route, from sporty <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-puffer-jacket"">puffer jackets</a> and wool cropped coats to faux fur zip-ups and wrap trenches.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Funnel Neck Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952122.png?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Funnel neck coats are one of those <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2025-trends"">runway trends</a> that are <em>actually</em> wearable IRL. The exaggerated high necks aren’t just dramatic, they’re also practical for keeping the wind and snow from ruining your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-makeup-looks"">winter makeup looks</a>. You can find the trendy silhouette across leather jackets, wool dress coats, and even longline vests.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Animal Print Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952143.png?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>Nothing says winter glamour like a faux-fur coat. And an <em>animal print</em> faux-fur coat is an even more bold and playful option. While you can’t go wrong with classic leopards and cheetahs, more unexpected animal prints — like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-cow-print"">cow</a>, zebra, deer, giraffe, and even snow leopard — are trending. There are also non-furry fabrics that can be worn cross-seasonally.</p>

<p><em>You say you want change?</em> Well, the time has come! <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/weekly-horoscopes-january-18-to-24-meaning-effects"">Action planet Mars</a> is entering the sign of Aquarius, encouraging us to push back popular notions and lean into our one-of-a-kind perspectives. The opportunity to express ourselves is here. As a result, we’ll be able to direct our attention toward the future and take steps to set the intention that will help us attain our dream. First, we must get out of our comfort zones and take a leap of faith. Every visionary has begun their journey here. Let’s get it started! The path less taken is ready for us to walk down. </p>



<p>It’s been over a year since Mars was in the Air sign of Aquarius. Now that it’s coming back into orbit, from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/weekly-horoscopes-january-18-to-24-meaning-effects"">January 23rd to March 2nd</a>, we are reaffirming our commitment to causes and striving to give our best to care for others in our community. Mars in Aquarius isn’t shy about giving us the stamina to assert ourselves. Still, this transit does require a more innovative approach to taking a stance and defining our needs and desires. This often marks a time of uprising and rebellion, when we speak our minds and take a stand to assert our personal beliefs. Note that this can transcend in any form — from something as simple as defying the “norms” of relationships to fashion trends to peer groups. We’re elevating our lives to showcase our unique sentiments, feelings, and talents. </p>



<p>While it is fantastic to captivate an audience and to hold personal power, the caveat is that once we get on our soapboxes, it’ll be hard to listen to different perspectives and not force our ideals onto others. Knowing when to slow down and take a step back can be challenging, but it’s essential. To effect change in the world, we must have an open mind and accept that everyone holds different views — even if we disagree with them. However, having an active discourse and debate is a great way to harness the diverse ways people think. A moderator, or mutual acquaintance, should be present to ensure we do not take the conversation too far — especially on January 19th, when Mars and Pluto form a conjunction in Aquarius (this is an astrological aspect that occurs when two planets come together in the same sign and degree) triangulating circumstances.   </p>



<p>Being a social justice warrior will be at the forefront of our hearts and passions. Still, it’s also vital to examine situations that require assistance on both a smaller scale and a collective level. Focusing on social dynamics, injustices, and local issues in our neighborhoods or cities will be necessary. Try to be more involved in politics, voter registration, or even participate in charitable endeavors. Paying it forward will be rewarding on many levels, particularly when it comes to our aspirations to better the common good — a vibe we will feel during the Snow Full Moon in Leo on February 1st. </p>



<p>When it comes to friendships and relationships, we often find ourselves drawn to those who align with our aspirations. Looking at the people who add fun, excitement, and push us to think outside the box propels us to regenerate our lives and be different. Their presence reassures and inspires us to be our best, most authentic selves. We can live freely and authentically, thanks to Mars in Aquarius. February 27th motivates us to take the leap towards confidence and embracing ourselves, due to Uranus in Taurus squaring off with Mars. We’ll want to make a break into the purest essences that define us. </p>



<p>Mars in Aquarius is going to be a moment in which we strive to be greater. We aren’t going to sit back and let life happen. Be bold and daring! By taking a firm stand, we can do our best to implement transformation and evolution — not only in the world but also in our personal lives. The goal is to improve in any way we can, so what are you waiting for?</p>

<p>If 2025 was the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bob-haircut-trends-2026"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">year of the bob</a>, then 2026 is the year that the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/01/11843952/pixie-haircut-trends-2025"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">pixie cut </a>steals the spotlight back.  </p>



<p>Some might say that last year’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/korean-two-in-one-haircut-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">jaw-grazing cuts</a> were just leading up to this moment—and they’d probably be right. We can’t scroll through Instagram without spotting a meticulously carved <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/summer-haircut-trends-2025"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">pixie crop</a>, whether on a celebrity like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/teyanataylor/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Teyana Taylor</a> or an influencer like <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@yeslydimate?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Yesly Dimate</a>. </p>



<p>There isn’t a pixie cut that <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/davidboardman_/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">David Boardman</a> — a hairstylist located at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/cutlersalon/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cutler Salon</a> in New York — hasn’t mastered, and he has a sense of why it’s making a huge comeback in 2026: “It’s all about individuality and boldness,” Boardman tells R29. “It’s a style that blends softness and ease, allowing you to play with volume and texture.”  </p>



<p>Boardman says that you can “slim” it down for a sleek, tapered look or add fullness for a more dynamic shape. “Ultimately, the pixie cut accentuates your best features and brings out your personality in the most authentic way,” he says.  </p>

The chopped-in fringe adds a subtle edge, taking it from bowl-like to modern. To achieve that bitty, separated finish at the front, your stylist will cut vertically into the strands as a final touch. </p>

<p>This cut sits in a cozy space between a pixie and a shag.
