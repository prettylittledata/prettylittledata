<h4>Our brain is a prediction machine that can’t be stopped. No matter how hard we try, it will still build expectations.</h4><p>If you’re reading this, you’ve probably asked yourself the same question I always have: What exactly makes users subconsciously follow <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279871278_Color-in-Context_Theory"">Color Psychology</a>, <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles?srsltid=AfmBOopi3ws2HhTLq5t9k-4j8DcE9Ef_W6XddNvGAqidJSuDQZDW4XU4"">Gestalt principles</a>, and behavioral patterns like <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/hicks-law/"">Hick’s law</a>? Why does all of this work? Is there a way to understand the true nature of our brain and not just how it reacts, but why it predicts, expects, and perceives the world the way it does?</p><p>Now it’s time to go one level deeper — into the core of how our brain actually works. In this article, we’ll touch on one of the fundamental theories that helps me personally answer these questions, and I would love to share it with you. Buckle up, we’re shifting into nerd gear!</p><h3>The Free Energy Principle</h3><p>In 2010, in his paper <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2787"">The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_J._Friston"">Karl Friston</a> formally introduced a theory stating that every system, including living organisms, strives to minimize free energy. Simple enough: we don’t like surprises. But let’s take a closer look at what that really means.</p><figure><img alt=""Portrait of neuroscientist Karl Friston, author of the Free Energy Principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*SSE0hdbj4PtpTqh7.jpg"" /><figcaption>Karl Friston, Photo by Kate Peters (<a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/karl-friston-free-energy-principle-artificial-intelligence/"">WIRED</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The brain’s main task is to minimize the gap between expectation and reality. This gap is what the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle"">Free Energy Principle</a> defines as free energy. When the brain encounters unpredictable input, its stress level rises. And it’s crucial to understand: this isn’t about you as a person or a “user”, it’s about your brain. It’s not something we consciously control, but it’s something we can use.</p><p>After all, as humans, we don’t always chase predictability or comfort. Many people enjoy physical exercise, even though it’s technically stress for the muscles. We love movies with unexpected plot twists, and even comedy works by placing us in a familiar setup and then adding an unpredictable punchline.</p><p>That’s because we’re more than just our brains. The human organism and our consciousness is a complex system of subsystems, including our hormonal system, which can reward the brain with the right chemistry under stress, or reinforce behavior when we act in line with its internal “program.”</p><p>So, the Free Energy Principle is actually quite a complex theory, and there are different mathematical interpretations of it. But for simplicity and convenience, today we’re going to look at a more accessible formula:</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram of the free energy equation with each variable labeled."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OltXx93fAkWg9_8i2HvACw.png"" /></figure><p>We can break it down into several key variables:</p><ul><li><strong><em>F</em> </strong>— variational free energy: this is the result of our brain’s calculations. For the brain (or any predictive system) to remain in a stable, low-stress state, F should approach zero. The higher the free energy, the greater the stress or uncertainty in the system. This idea directly connects to the concept of entropy, the natural tendency toward disorder which both we and our brains constantly try to resist.</li><li><strong><em>s</em></strong> — sensory input: everything we receive from the external world — sounds, tactile sensations, visual images, etc.</li><li><strong><em>m</em></strong> — internal model: our internal representation of how the world works. Essentially, our expectations about external reality or specific aspects of it.</li><li><strong><em>P</em></strong><em> </em>— probability: represents the likelihood of a certain sensory input given our internal model (it’s defined by what’s in the parentheses but not part of the main operation). The result ranges from 0 to 1, since it’s a probability.</li><li><strong>−ln</strong> — natural logarithm: this function converts probabilities (values between 0 and 1) into a scale from 0 to infinity, making the difference between expectation and reality mathematically measurable but not limited.</li></ul><p>The higher the probability, the smaller the resulting value. In other words, our brain is “happy” when the probability of our expectations matching what we actually perceive equals 1 (maximum probability) — in that case, F=0. The lower the probability (P), the greater the amount of free energy (F): 1 = 0; 0.5 = 0.69; 0.1 = 2.3; 0.01 = 4.6.</p><p>Let’s look at an example. A user moves the cursor over something that looks like a button: text on a bright blue rectangle.</p><figure><img alt=""Interface example of a button with active cursor"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*idKF4TdvSkphrORSln-aGg.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p>m — the user expects that the button will somehow change its state, what we usually call a hover state.</p><p>s — nothing happens to the button itself, but the cursor changes.</p><p>Technically, the user’s expectations were violated. But since our internal models are more complex than a single visual reaction, the additional input (the cursor change) helped complete the picture. When the button eventually responds to a click, the user almost immediately forgets the odd interaction.</p><p>Their P might have dropped slightly, perhaps to 0.95, meaning the probability that their mental model still matches the incoming input remains very high. The amount of free energy is close to zero. The brain is calm, the user is satisfied, the product is sold.</p><p>Now let’s take a negative example. The user moves the cursor over the same button: the same text, the same blue rectangle. The user once again expects that clicking it will initiate a purchase, that’s our m (the internal model).</p><p>But the response is nothing: no color change, no cursor change, not even an error message. The user clicks repeatedly. Their P (probability) that their mental model matches the actual input, drops close to zero.</p><figure><img alt=""Interface example of a button with no hover feedback."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SN8vFhrI6J4EoE0zb1jFCA.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p>The brain starts trying to reduce the growing amount of free energy, sending out emotional signals. In this case, the button, the site, the entire interaction become irritants. Almost unconsciously, the user begins performing a series of random actions, trying to fix the problem.</p><p>And if we’re lucky, they eventually scroll up and notice that the email field is outlined in red with a message saying it’s required. They enter the email, click Buy again, and finally succeed.</p><p>Not as happy, but at least with a product on the way. All of this happened simply because the button had no disabled state, no visual communication that it couldn’t yet be pressed, forcing the user to waste five tense seconds clicking into nothing.</p><p>This is a fairly simple example that directly illustrates the relationship between our expectations and our perception of reality. But there are many others that you, as designers, already know well.</p><p>Take the Gestalt principles, for instance. We don’t just see a random collection of shapes but we instinctively try to group them and assign meaning. It’s something our brain does automatically, without conscious effort. That’s exactly why, at the beginning of this section, I emphasized that this principle isn’t about us as individuals. It’s about our brain itself.</p><p>Our brain constantly relies on its internal model, comparing it with the incoming sensory input we receive. And when the amount of free energy becomes too high, the brain automatically tries to fix the problem.</p><p>It starts to create new categories or groups, sending the necessary emotional signals to push us toward resolving the discrepancy. Sometimes, it adjusts the internal model itself, modifying m in the formula to reduce the gap between expectation and reality. That’s actually how we learn something new and this, in fact, can explain the very nature of our neuroplasticity.</p><p>But the brain can also go the other way distorting perception, effectively altering s in the formula, the sensory input itself. And that’s where we enter the territory of cognitive biases and perceptual illusions, an entire field in itself, and one that truly deserves the attention of us designers.</p><h3>Abduction is the key to humanity</h3><p>I’m confident in saying that almost every well-known principle we are using in design can ultimately be explained through the Free Energy Principle. But that doesn’t mean we, as designers, need to consciously apply it in our daily work. Good and even excellent designers usually operate within the beginner and intermediate levels of design psychology, and that’s more than enough to create meaningful, functional products.</p><p>For me personally, it has always been and still is fascinating to understand why things, principles, and rules work the way they do. That’s why I try to find explanations and new perspectives through different sciences. And psychology is one of them.</p><p>With this article, I’d like to invite you to look at the familiar design dogmas we follow from a slightly different angle and to try broadening our perspective.</p><p>In a world where AI already knows all these rules and can even create interfaces based on them, what may soon remain truly ours is our human curiosity, the desire to reach for truth, to question what we take for granted, and to look at problems from new angles, expanding the boundaries of any given task.</p><p>In the language of philosophy, specifically the branch of logic we, as humans and users, most often rely on deduction and induction.</p><p>Deduction is deriving consequences from established rules. When we build our hypotheses based on principles and patterns. All clickable elements should change their state on hover → This button changes its state on hover → Therefore, this button is a clickable element.</p><p>Induction is generalizing from experience. When we conduct direct user testing. Our user clicked 100 different buttons, and each time the button changed its state on hover → The user now expects that all buttons should change their state when hovered over.</p><p>But we, as designers, are expected to bring new ideas into the world.</p><p>So I’d like to invite you to look at another type of reasoning — abduction. It is the process of forming a hypothesis that could best explain an observation.</p><figure><img alt=""Triangular diagram showing the relation between abduction, deduction and induction with text descriptions."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/850/1*cLJYu98iQ0ogbr6iNisEuw.png"" /><figcaption>The relation between abduction, deduction and induction. <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Fig-A1-The-relation-between-abduction-deduction-and-induction-Several-alternative_fig1_48326326"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>We notice that users often close the payment page without clicking the button → What if the problem isn’t the button’s state but the emotional context — the anxiety or distrust triggered by the act of payment? → Let’s change “Pay” to “Secure Payment” and add the logos of trusted payment providers below the button to increase confidence.</p><blockquote>Abduction is the process of forming explanatory hypotheses. It is the only logical operation which introduces any new idea.<br /><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce""><em>Charles S. Peirce</em></a><em> in </em><a href=""https://isidore.co/misc/Res%20pro%20Deo/Peirce/Done/5.html""><em>Collected Papers, CP 5.172</em></a></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Portrait of philosopher Charles S.

It’s how we were able to achieve such heights of science and technology out of nothing.</p><p>And this ability appeared in us precisely because our brain tries to get rid of free energy. That’s why I believe this principle is important not only to try to explain user behavior, but it is fundamental for us, as creators, thinkers, and engineers.</p><h3>Final thoughts</h3><p>And as for the practical application of today’s topic, I suggest you the following approach as an experiment just for yourself: if you’re facing a tough problem or one you’ve solved a hundred times, try ignoring all design principles for a moment. Approach it as if you only had abduction to generate hypotheses and the Free Energy Principle to evaluate them.</p><p>Take a specific user and the situation they’re in, then sketch several alternative solutions you can score with the formula F = −ln P(s∣m).</p><p>Fill in the variables: m (what the user expected) and s (what the user actually saw). Then estimate which solution “minimizes free energy”, meaning yields the highest probability that perception will match expectation. And that’s your leading candidate.</p><p>And remember, psychology gives us the lens, design provides the tools, but the final verdict always belongs to the human being whose subjective perception can overturn any formula. That’s why theory is only valuable as long as it remains flexible, ready to yield to real observation, to the living unpredictable experience of the people we design for.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=0e557d122b81"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/lower-the-surprise-applying-the-free-energy-principle-to-ux-0e557d122b81"">Lower the surprise: Applying The free energy principle to UX</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I’m talking about <strong>architecting the “how”</strong> — the flow of cognitive work between human and AI. Who does what? Where does intelligence live? How do they collaborate? This is the discipline of designing intelligent systems, not just intelligent features.</p><p>Let me show you exactly how Perplexity and NotebookLM do it — and what you can apply to your own products.</p><h3>The architecture difference</h3><p>Here’s what people miss:</p><p>Both products run on the same foundation — large language models, vector embeddings, search APIs, retrieval-augmented generation.</p><p><strong>Same ingredients.

Intelligence Flow Architecture = intelligence embedded in the system’s core.)</p><h4><strong>The four principles</strong></h4><h3>Principle 1: Design backward from autonomous execution</h3><p>Don’t start with: <em>“What interface should we show?”</em></p><p>Start with: <em>“What will the system DO autonomously?”</em></p><ul><li>Perplexity: Search + synthesize + cite</li><li>NotebookLM: Analyze + map + generate formats</li></ul><p>Then design everything else to enable that autonomy.</p><p>This inverts traditional software design. Traditional products started with the interface — buttons, menus, workflows — then built backend systems to support them. Intelligence-first architecture starts with autonomous execution and works backward.</p><blockquote><em>The shift is profound: from </em>“How will users accomplish this task?” to “What can the system accomplish autonomously?” <em>As </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_RjOhCkhvQ""><em>Satya Nadella</em></a><em> noted, we’re moving business logic from the application tier to the intelligence tier. The execution layer defines your system’s value — everything else exists to enable it.</em></blockquote><p>Without this inversion, you end up with “AI features” bolted onto traditional interfaces. The intelligence feels like an add-on because it IS an add-on. True intelligence-first architecture means intelligence is embedded as fundamental structure, not added as features.</p><h3>Principle 2: Embed intelligence in specific layers</h3><p>Don’t bolt AI on as features.</p><p>Architect where intelligence lives:</p><ul><li>Perplexity: Intelligence in synthesis layer</li><li>NotebookLM: Intelligence in knowledge processing layer</li></ul><p>The intelligence isn’t visible as “AI feature” — it’s structural.</p><p>The test for embedded intelligence: Can you remove the AI and still have a functional product? If yes, intelligence is bolted on. If no, it’s embedded.</p><p>Perplexity without its synthesis intelligence doesn’t exist — it’s not “Google with AI added,” it’s a fundamentally different architecture where intelligence IS the product. NotebookLM’s knowledge processing layer isn’t a feature you can toggle off; it’s the system’s foundation.</p><p>This architectural embedding happens in specific layers of your five-layer stack. Intelligence doesn’t float everywhere — it concentrates where transformation occurs. In Perplexity, that’s Layer 2 (synthesis orchestration). In NotebookLM, it’s Layer 2 (knowledge graph construction). Identify where YOUR system’s intelligence must live, then build everything to support that layer.</p><h3>Principle 3: Design clear human/AI boundaries</h3><p>Define precisely where AI works autonomously and where human provides direction:</p><ul><li>Perplexity: Human directs → AI discovers → Human evaluates</li><li>NotebookLM: Human curates → AI orchestrates → Human explores</li></ul><blockquote><strong><em>Think of this as creating control maps — the new journey maps for AI experiences.</em></strong><em> Instead of mapping what users do, you map who is in control (user, AI, or both) and when that control shifts. As </em><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/from-journey-maps-to-control-maps-17aac58b9dd9""><em>Rob Chappell</em></a><em> notes, </em>“The question is no longer ‘What is the user trying to do?’ The more relevant question is: ‘Who is in control at this moment, and how does that shift?’”</blockquote><p>This is the evolution from traditional user journeys to human-AI collaboration flows.</p><p><strong>This pattern is becoming so clear that in June 2025, Karpathy dedicated his Y Combinator keynote to it.</strong> He calls it “partial autonomy” — systems where AI generates and humans verify in a continuous loop.</p><p>The architectural insight: <strong>The fastest generation-verification loop wins. Not the most autonomous AI.</strong></p><p>That’s why <a href=""https://cursor.com/"">Cursor</a> (coding), Perplexity (search), and NotebookLM (research) are succeeding — they optimized the loop, not the autonomy.</p><h3>Principle 4: Optimize for cognitive distribution</h3><p>Not: “Can AI do this task?”</p><p>But: “SHOULD AI do this, or SHOULD human?”</p><ul><li><strong>Human strengths:</strong> Goal definition, judgment, creative direction, evaluation</li><li><strong>AI strengths:</strong> Discovery, synthesis, pattern recognition, execution</li></ul><p>Both products make this mapping explicit in their architecture.</p><p>This requires mapping cognitive strengths systematically. From your Hybrid Cognition Map: Humans excel at goal definition, context understanding, judgment calls, ambiguity resolution, ethical decisions, creative direction, and stakeholder intuition. AI excels at information retrieval, pattern recognition, rapid iteration, consistency, tedious execution, multi-source synthesis, and 24/7 availability.</p><p>The magic happens at the intersection — not human OR AI, but human AND AI working in complementary strengths. Perplexity distributes: human defines information need (judgment), AI discovers and synthesizes (execution). NotebookLM distributes: human curates sources (context), AI processes and orchestrates (synthesis).</p><p>Poor cognitive distribution creates friction. If you ask humans to do what AI does better (tedious data processing), or ask AI to do what humans do better (strategic judgment), the collaboration fails. Design explicitly for strengths, not just capabilities.</p><figure><img alt=""The complete framework: Four principles that define how Perplexity and NotebookLM architect human-AI collaboration.

I took photos of the worksheet, showed them to an AI, and asked it to generate similar exercises. Seconds later: a new practice set, perfectly matched to her level.</p><p>She finished it. Asked for another. I already had everything loaded — another set appeared in seconds.</p><p><strong>This wasn’t impressive because the AI was smart.</strong> It was impressive because I’d designed the <strong>how</strong>: Photo → Parse → Generate → Verify → Iterate. A five-second intelligence flow that would have taken me 30 minutes manually.</p><p>That’s Intelligence Flow Architecture in daily life.</p><p>Now let’s make it actionable for your team.</p><h3>From analysis to application</h3><p>You’ve seen how Perplexity and NotebookLM architect intelligence flows.</p><p>Now let’s make this actionable for your team.</p><p>The method works for any product workflow — from email to CRM to document editing.</p><p>Here’s the four-step process:</p><h3>How to apply intelligence flow architecture to your product</h3><h4><strong>STEP 1: Map your current workflow</strong></h4><p>Pick one core workflow. List every step users do manually.</p><h4><strong>STEP 2: Identify cognitive work</strong></h4><p>For each step, ask:</p><ul><li>Is this discovery work? (AI strength)</li><li>Is this synthesis? (AI strength)</li><li>Is this judgment? (Human strength)</li><li>Is this goal-setting? (Human strength)</li></ul><h4><strong>STEP 3: Design the intelligence flow</strong></h4><p>Redistribute work:</p><ul><li>What should AI do autonomously?</li><li>Where does human direct?</li><li>What are the handoff points?</li></ul><h4><strong>STEP 4: Design backward from execution</strong></h4><ul><li>What will AI execute? (execution layer)</li><li>What intelligence enables that? (intelligence layer)</li><li>How do systems coordinate? (orchestration layer)</li><li>How does human express intention? (input layer)</li></ul><h4><strong>Example: Redesigning email with Intelligence Flow Architecture</strong></h4><p>Let’s make this concrete. Here’s how Intelligence Flow Architecture transforms a common workflow — email composition.</p><p>Traditional Gmail requires you to manually type, edit, format, and send — roughly 5 minutes of writing every word. Intelligence Flow Architecture redesigns this as a 6-layer collaboration where AI handles autonomous execution while you provide direction and judgment.</p><p>The result: 30 seconds instead of 5 minutes. Directing instead of writing.</p><figure><img alt=""Email workflow transformation: Traditional Gmail requires 5 minutes of manual writing.

The Tesla lesson</h3><p>Before we dive into what this means for product teams, let’s address the obvious question: <strong>Why design for partial autonomy instead of full autonomous agents?</strong></p><p>In his June 2025 keynote, Karpathy shared a telling story from his five years building autonomous systems at Tesla:</p><p>In 2013, he took a perfect self-driving ride in a Waymo — zero interventions, flawless. He thought: “Self-driving is imminent.”</p><p><strong>That was 12 years ago.</strong> Even now, <a href=""https://waymo.com/"">Waymo vehicles</a> that appear driverless still require significant human teleoperation and oversight.</p><blockquote><strong><em>His warning applies directly to product design:</em></strong><em> When AI generates massive outputs — 10,000 lines of code, complete research reports, fully redesigned interfaces — you haven’t saved time if verification takes hours. </em>“When I see things like ‘oh 2025 is the year of agents,’ I get very concerned. This is the <strong>decade</strong> of agents.”</blockquote><blockquote><strong>“We have to keep the AI on the leash,”</strong> <em>Karpathy emphasized. Not because AI isn’t capable, but because </em><strong><em>verification speed determines actual productivity.</em></strong></blockquote><p>This is why Intelligence Flow Architecture prioritizes the generation-verification loop over full autonomy. The goal isn’t to remove humans from the loop. <strong>The goal is to make the loop spin as fast as possible.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Karpathy’s lesson from 12 years at Tesla: Fast generation-verification loops beat pursuing full autonomy. Loop speed determines productivity, not autonomy level."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2OemyGgIYm1AjKuiQUmbuQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Karpathy’s lesson from 12 years at Tesla: Fast generation-verification </em>loops beat pursuing full autonomy. Loop speed determines productivity, <em>not autonomy level. </em>Visualization created with Gemini AI.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>A note for designers:</strong> You might be thinking “I’m not a system architect. Can I actually apply this?” Yes. Intelligence Flow Architecture isn’t about backend engineering — it’s about design thinking applied to human-AI collaboration. Start small: Pick one workflow. Map where human directs vs where AI executes. That’s architecting intelligence flows. You’re already doing this thinking — now you have language for it.</p><h3>What this means for product teams</h3><p>Here’s what changes when you adopt Intelligence Flow Architecture:</p><h4><strong>BEFORE (AI Features):</strong></h4><ul><li>PM says: “Let’s add AI to this workflow”</li><li>Designer asks: “What should the AI button look like?”</li><li>Engineer builds: API call to GPT → show response</li><li>Result: Feature that feels bolted on</li></ul><h4><strong>AFTER (Intelligence Flow Architecture):</strong></h4><ul><li>PM asks: “What cognitive work should AI handle autonomously?”</li><li>Designer maps: Human direction → AI execution → Human evaluation</li><li>Engineer architects: Intelligence layer + orchestration layer + execution layer</li><li>Result: System that feels intelligent</li></ul><h3><strong>The pattern</strong></h3><p>Perplexity and NotebookLM didn’t ask “How do we add AI?”</p><p>They asked: “How do we architect collaboration between human and artificial intelligence?”</p><p>That’s the difference between an AI feature and an intelligent system.</p><p>That’s Intelligence Flow Architecture.</p><p>And that framework — deciding where intelligence lives, how work distributes, when systems execute autonomously — <strong>that’s intelligence-first architecture.</strong></p><p><strong>Same AI models.</strong><br /><strong>Different architecture.</strong><br /><strong>Completely different experience.</strong></p><p>Now you know why.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ace59eeda531"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/perplexity-and-notebooklm-dont-use-better-ai-they-use-better-intelligence-flow-architecture-ace59eeda531"">Perplexity and NotebookLM don’t use better AI—they use better intelligence flow architecture</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Emerging personality patterns that drive differentiation in AI products</h4><figure><img alt=""Cover image depicting different AI products like Slack bot, Claude, Tolans and Moxie robot."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*r5Fda8lcau0bg7QYOs1FHw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>In 1966, MIT’s Joseph Weizenbaum created ELIZA, a conversational AI that mimicked a Rogerian therapist using simple pattern matching. Despite its limited design, many users felt understood and emotionally “seen,” attributing empathy and intent to the system, a phenomenon later called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect""><strong>“ELIZA effect</strong></a><strong>”. </strong>From the very start, people related to even basic conversational software as if it had a mind of its own.</p><p>Long before modern AI, product and brand design had already embraced personality as a differentiator. <a href=""https://imgs.search.brave.com/bGxPgSeNEiF9Eug7c4YNn_bgulI2vwDeCDJqyq_KKtU/rs:fit:860:0:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9kMmlq/ejZvNXhheTF4cS5j/bG91ZGZyb250Lm5l/dC9hY2NvdW50XzQ4/MS9TY3JlZW5zaG90/MjAxOC0xMS0wOGF0/MTFfMDRfMThBTV81/NDI1N2M0MTI4M2Mx/NWI0YTMxNTRiNjMz/ZDRlY2IxNV84MDAu/cG5n"">Mailchimp’s playful feedback</a> or <a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/slack-copywriting-what-they-say-to-9-6-million-pageviews-every-month-4351888f1c2c"">Slack’s quirky copywriting</a> showed how tone and character could give otherwise functional software a distinctive emotional presence. Design theory reinforces this! <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_Design""><strong>Norman’s emotional design theory</strong></a> shows that products which evoke emotion foster attachment and loyalty<strong>,</strong> while <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism""><strong>anthropomorphism</strong></a><strong> </strong>explains our instinct to assign human traits to machines.<strong> </strong>Sherry Turkle’s research at MIT shows that people form <a href=""https://sts-program.mit.edu/book/alone-together-expect-technology-less-eachother/""><strong>“artificial intimacy”</strong></a> with conversational agents assigning them emotions, motives, and moral qualities as if they were caring entities rather than tools.</p><p>In modern AI systems, this projection becomes even more consequential. Anthropic, for example, shapes <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyJj9RxSsBY""><strong>Claude</strong> around a deliberate character</a> — thoughtful, principled, and balanced — by embedding values and ethical reasoning into how the model thinks and responds.</p><p>Thus<strong>, designing for personality shifts from a branding layer to a core interaction layer </strong>that shapes trust, adoption, and long-term habits.</p><h3>Emerging personality patterns in AI products</h3><p>This framework draws from my work on a virtual pet at <a href=""https://www.ideo.com/"">IDEO</a>, a companion robot at <a href=""https://miko.ai/"">Miko.ai</a>, and most recently an AI tutor at <a href=""https://www.getsupernova.ai/new-home"">SuperNova AI </a>— supported by research (reference list in the end) across HCI, HRI, and narrative design .</p><p>Personality in AI systems is shaped much like a human character with underlying internal traits that drive behavior and external expressive cues that make those traits visible.</p><ul><li><strong>Internal layer</strong> refers to the traits and personality cues like values, worldview, personality archetype, backstory and contextual intelligence.</li><li><strong>External layer</strong> expresses these traits through the surface with avatar, typography, tone of voice, motion, and other multi-modal feedback cues.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""A diagram showing an AI personality model with Internal Layer components on the left and External Layer components on the right, all pointing to a central AI icon.

Purpose, worldview and values</h3><h4><strong>Purpose</strong></h4><p>Purpose is the starting point and shapes the AI’s <em>relationship</em> to the user based on what it helps them accomplish. <br /><br />An AI built to <em>teach</em> will naturally behave differently from one designed to <em>co-create an app or automate commands</em>. <strong>Defining purpose guides —</strong></p><ul><li><em>What is this AI supposed to accomplish for users?</em></li><li><em>What should be the nature of AI-human relation? Is the interaction like interacting with a tool help, a pet/ companion or a collaborator/ supervisor/ assistant?</em></li></ul><p>After purpose, worldview and values form the underlying belief system that makes the AI’s behavior consistent and predictable across different situations.</p><h4><strong>Worldview</strong></h4><p>Defines <em>how the AI interprets problems and reasons under uncertainty, </em>whether it approaches tasks with caution, optimism, curiosity, or analytical detachment. <strong>Defining worldview guides —</strong></p><ul><li><em>How should user needs/ problems be approached?</em></li><li><em>What matters most in its interactions?</em></li></ul><h4><strong>Values</strong></h4><p>Define the AI’s ethical boundaries and priorities — the principles it won’t break. They influence not only <em>what</em> the AI refuses, but <em>how</em> it refuses, shaping the emotional tone of guardrails. <strong>Defining values guides —</strong></p><ul><li>What are the rules it shouldn’t break?</li><li>How should it protect or guide the user?</li></ul><figure><img alt=""A split-screen image explaining Purpose, Worldview, and Values using Claude’s system prompt.

Archetypes</h3><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype#:~:text=An%20archetype%20can%20be%20any,,%20or%20%22merge%22%20into.""><strong>Brand archetypes</strong></a> are universal character prototypes drawn from Carl Jung’s psychology. Brands adopt these familiar personas to evoke specific emotions and embody core values.</p><p>Selecting an archetype helps determine whether your AI feels like a playful entertainer (Jester), a wise advisor (Sage), an empathetic supporter (Caregiver) or any of the other twelve classic archetypes.</p><figure><img alt=""A brand-archetype wheel showing twelve archetypes (Creator, Innocent, Sage, Explorer, Outlaw, Magician, Hero, Lover, Jester, Everyman, Caregiver, Ruler).

Its warm, calm visual identity and starburst icon signal structure and trust, while its communication style stays gentle, honest, and reflective.</li><li><strong>Wysa (Jester + Coach)</strong> a compassionate, judgment-free companion focused on emotional support and guided healing. Its cute penguin mascot and playful tone signal approachability and warmth, while its communication style stays empathetic, encouraging, and grounded in evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy.</li></ul><p>Archetypes resonate at a subconscious level guiding the design to maintain character consistency and thus strengthening user experience and engagement.</p><h3>3. Backstory</h3><p>In consumer-facing AI, where emotional connection is key, backstory adds coherence and emotional weight to the interaction. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet_on_the_Holodeck"">Janet Murray’s Hamlet on the Holodeck</a> shows that when virtual characters have defined roles and histories, it enriches user interaction and making the system feel more alive and intentional.</p><figure><img alt=""An image of the Miko robot on the left and a chat transcript on the right, where Miko answers questions about its name, age, abilities, and identity with playful personality. A caption explains that Miko robots have rich backstories users uncover through conversation."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MXwMEzP9HuRskUPhuce0Bw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Some successful consumer products which follow this pattern strongly are</p><ul><li><a href=""http://www.miko.ai""><strong>Miko</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The companion robot invites children to ask, <em>“Where did you come from?”, “What’s your job?”, “Are you a boy or a girl?”</em> — revealing his backstory and personality through playful dialogue.</li><li><a href=""https://www.tolans.com/""><strong>Tolan</strong></a><strong>:</strong> General-purpose assistants take on the persona of friendly aliens from planet Portolah, each arriving with distinct personalities and quirks to befriend their human companions</li><li><a href=""https://character.ai/""><strong>Character.ai</strong></a><strong>:</strong> A massive platform where users chat with millions of AI characters, each with detailed backstories, personalities and fictional histories to explore.</li></ul><h3>4. Context adaptation</h3><p>Contextual adaptation is the AI’s ability to respond appropriately to a user’s <strong>situational context or emotional state</strong> and shaping tone, language, and pacing to feel human and supportive.</p><p>This relies on techniques like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_recognition""><strong>emotional state recognition</strong></a> (detecting sentiment or tone), <a href=""https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/ai-mirroring-behaviors""><strong>conversational mirroring</strong></a> (reflecting the user’s phrasing or energy), and <strong>contextual personality shifting</strong> (adjusting tone or style based on task complexity or user mood) .</p><ul><li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa""><strong>Alexa</strong></a>, though simpler, varies its vocal delivery: sounding excited when offering good news (“It’s sunny all day!”) or disappointed when reporting a loss, reinforcing its role as a helpful household companion.</li><li><a href=""https://answeringagent.com/blog/5-ways-ai-adapts-tone-for-customer-calls""><strong>T-Mobile’s AI</strong> reduced customer complaints by 73%</a> through instant detection of negative sentiment and tone mirroring</li><li><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.replika.app&amp;hl=en_IN&amp;pli=1""><strong>Replika</strong></a>, performs deep, long-term mirroring. It learns a user’s vocabulary, emotional patterns, and interaction style over many conversations, gradually shaping its own language, tone, and even “personality” to reflect the individual.</li></ul><h3>5. Visual identity</h3><p>Visual identity is often the first layer through which users infer an AI product’s personality. Design decisions around logo, avatar, color, type and even hardware shapes cues.</p><figure><img alt=""Image showing Perplexity’s geometric logo, Claude’s serif typography, and the Lovot robot. A caption notes that Claude’s serifs feel warm and credible, Perplexity’s sans-serif feels modern and analytical, and Lovot’s soft design conveys a companion-like personality."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sQ7i9Nt3p9T041kdfEAYoQ.jpeg"" /></figure><ul><li><strong>Logo/ Avatar/ Embodied identity </strong>give an AI a recognizable “face” and act as an immediate proxy for personality. For instance, <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/"">Perplexity</a>’s logo, is minimal, geometric, and abstract and it subtly animates during search to cue users that AI is creating an answer. On the other end of the spectrum, more expressive AI products like <a href=""https://lovot.life/en/"">Lovot</a> uses a physical body, large eyes, soft materials, and even personalised clothing to project warmth, affection, and a companion-like presence.</li><li><strong>Typography</strong> contributes to brand voice in chat interfaces. For example, <strong>Claude’s serif typography conveys</strong> warmth, maturity, and approachability — qualities that align with its thoughtful, privacy-first positioning. <strong>Perplexity’s geometric sans-serif communicates</strong> modern technical clarity and reliability, reinforcing its role as a precise, research-oriented tool.</li><li><strong>Illustrations/ Imagery:</strong> Supports communicating information in a delightful way</li><li><strong>Motion and Animation: </strong>Motion guidelines define how elements animate, transition, and respond to user interaction.</li><li><strong>Color palette</strong> reinforce AI personality archetypes by leveraging emotional associations rooted in color psychology. For example. blue signals trust and calm (Alexa), bright green colours signal playfulness and growth (Duolingo, Miko) and muted tones as professionalism (Notion AI).</li></ul><h3>6. Communication style &amp; copy</h3><p>Communication style and copy are also the most visible expressions of an AI’s personality. Whether experienced through <strong>voice or text,</strong> elements like <strong>tone</strong>, <strong>phrasing</strong>, <strong>pacing</strong>, <strong>formality </strong>work together to communicate character’s personality and guide user experience.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Duolingo’s writing guidelines page showing the section on ‘Voice’. It describes how Duolingo’s brand personality appears through words, supported by four voice qualities — expressive, playful, embracing and worldly — with a sidebar menu on the left and an illustration on top"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZOGg6drhwqpcvegAtbKosw.jpeg"" /></figure><h4>Core elements shared across voice and chat interfaces</h4><ul><li><strong>Tone</strong> sets the emotional posture: formal tones (e.g., <em>Sage</em>, <em>Ruler</em>) project authority and professionalism, while informal tones (e.g., <em>Everyman</em>, <em>Jester</em>) build warmth and approachability. For example, <a href=""https://www.capitalone.com/digital/tools/eno/"">Capital One’s Eno</a> uses “First things first” is perceived as friendlier than “Here is the first step” in user research.</li><li><strong>Phrasing and vocabulary</strong> reflect personality cues. For instance, a Caregiver might say “<em>“Let me walk you through this , we’ll figure it out together,”</em>,” while Sage personas might use precise, technical terms (e.g., “<em>“Let me explain the details step by step</em>”).</li><li><strong>Pacing and prosody</strong> (in voice), or <strong>structure and grammar</strong> (in text), shape rhythm and emphasis which is key to emotional delivery and comprehension. Models from <a href=""https://elevenlabs.io/docs/models"">ElevanLabs V3</a> and <a href=""https://cartesia.ai/sonic"">Cartesia</a> uses intentional pauses and inflection to simulate human-like and expressive speech generation.</li></ul><h4>Modality differences: Voice vs. Chat</h4><p>Voice-first interfaces (e.g., Alexa, Miko) rely heavily on <strong>prosody, timing, and conversational repair</strong>. Spoken interactions are adaptive — users naturally adjust tone, pacing, or emphasis when there’s confusion.</p><p>In contrast, chat-based interfaces (e.g., Claude, Perplexity) emphasize <strong>structural clarity, grammar, and concise phrasing</strong>.

Multimodal feedback</h3><p><strong>Multimodal feedback</strong> refers to the way an AI system expresses its internal states such as listening, thinking, processing, or responding sometime called <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/chain-of-thoughts""><strong>Chain-of-thought (CoT)</strong></a><strong> display </strong>through various visual design elements and multiple sensory channels. These channels can include <strong>visual cues</strong>, <strong>voice and sound design</strong>, <strong>micro-animations</strong>, <strong>LED lights</strong>, or <strong>haptics</strong>.</p><p><strong>It allows users to <em>see</em>, <em>hear</em> or <em>feel</em> what the AI is doing</strong>, making the interaction more interpretable, human-like and trustworthy.</p><figure><img alt=""Four examples of AI systems showing how they express internal state: Replit panels with micro-animations for thinking steps; Alexa device with LED ring phases — idle, listening, thinking, speaking; Duolingo voice call using animated character face; Moxie robot using voice, eyes, and body movement"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2C-JnFqBHXrmlqKoxgfg-g.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Multimodal feedback varies across products depending on how much personality is intended for the product.</p><ul><li><a href=""https://replit.com/ai"">Replit AI</a>, <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/"">Perplexity</a>, <a href=""https://claude.ai/"">Claude</a><strong> </strong>relies on <strong>icon animations</strong> and <strong>microcopy</strong> to communicates system states.</li><li>Alexa devices like <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B8V1LZ3?ref=amzdv_ucc_dp_lod__B09B8V1LZ3&amp;th=1"">Echo dot</a> uses <strong>LED lights</strong>, <strong>voice tone</strong> and <strong>sound effects</strong> to express internal states.

Research in human–robot interaction (Michalowski et al., 2007; Hoffman &amp; Breazeal, 2007; Breazeal, 2003) shows when robots align their timing with humans — pausing at the right moments, matching conversational pacing, or synchronizing gesture and gaze —<strong> interactions feel more alive</strong>, more engaging<strong>, more lifelike, and more trustworthy</strong>.</p><p>Products like <strong>Tolans</strong> use coordinated animations, eye-gaze, and motion timing to signal attention and emotional states, making the characters feel alive. Voice agents like <strong>Alexa</strong> similarly use rhythmic cues — brief pauses, LED pulses, and vocal pacing — to create a sense of responsiveness. In both cases, achieving the right timing transforms abstract AI behaviour into something that feels intentional, expressive, and socially fluent.</p><h3>When does personality matter?</h3><p>The fundamental question to ask before designing for personality, if your product needs one and how complex?</p><p>Not every AI system needs a quirky mascot or empathetic voice.

They want to build a product which they are super sure of; they have their pitch deck ready, investors are lined up, and they want to hit market in six months. All they need is a working product: an embodiment of their mission. As a product manager, you do the usual. In a short duration, you conjure up enough details to come up with a roadmap. A plan with all the required features to put the product in the hands of potential users. It is well-detailed, with release dates and launch timelines. You align the team and start development. <strong>What could go wrong?</strong></blockquote><p>Working constantly with early-stage startups has taught me one thing: startups are a minefield of uncertainty. If a founder believes they have all their answers on <strong>day one, </strong>they pretty much have a dream to sell you. It might just say that on the pitch deck.</p><p>In my experience, anything a startup builds in its early stages is a whole lot of assumptions wrapped around a concrete vision. When you start treating these assumptions as ground reality and planning features rather than outcomes, you create a recipe for trouble. A well-documented, timeline-based feature roadmap is often where the problem starts.</p><p>These plans actually give founder and teams a false sense of security. However, teams very quickly realise that:</p><p><strong>Feature roadmaps limit exploration and discovery. </strong>If the boundaries of exploration are limited to a predefined feature set, you quickly find yourself boxed in. Instead of giving the team ample time to actually solve problems, you end up preparing for the next release cycle as the team focuses on building the current feature on the list.</p><p><strong>Feature roadmaps leave little room for new information.</strong> These plans operate under the conviction that all underlying assumptions have been fully priced in, locking potential ideas, features, and deadlines in advance.</p><p>However, as you start working on the product, the <strong><em>act of building</em></strong> itself brings significant clarity. New information either challenges or validates previously made assumptions. As a result, you are compelled to carve out a new shape for the product — one that reflects an evolved understanding, sometimes with a focus on revised outcomes.</p><p>This is where feature roadmaps fail to adapt. They are built for predictability, and any change often leads to delays or scope expansion. You then have to resist new ideas and information just to stay on track with previously set timelines.</p><p><strong>Feature roadmaps have a confidence bias. </strong>They inherently believe that the solution, from the outset, is already fit for the market in its current shape. What is supposed to be a strategic and continuous discovery turns into a scheduling exercise. In reality, just because you are solving the right problem doesn’t mean the current shape of the product will perform well in the market.</p><p><strong>Feature roadmaps underestimate the invisible work.</strong> Development teams often require a fair amount of time and effort to figure out the <em>right</em> way to build before dipping their hands into execution. This is difficult to plan for, as the paths of discovery are not always linear. Sometimes you have to spend more time delivering the same planned item. The timeline is affected not by new demands, but by a well-defined scope.</p><blockquote><em>A PM I know used to say ‘</em><strong><em>Roadmaps are the glue that makes strategy stick to planning’. </em></strong><em>Lately, I feel the longer they are planned for, the </em><strong><em>harder</em></strong><em> they set in, making things very difficult and </em><strong><em>costly</em></strong><em> to pull away.</em></blockquote><p>Don’t get me wrong. I am not saying they are a bad exercise. Early-stage startups <strong>need</strong> to have a vision and a pathway to get there, and roadmaps serve that purpose effectively. What I do take issue with is the way of thinking that propagates building ‘all the things we thought were correct <strong>then</strong>’ at the cost of ‘what we know <strong>now’,</strong> treating previous ideas as gospel truth. A product being built just for the sake of it. It’s a lose-lose situation for everyone.</p><p>So, what’s the alternative?</p><ol><li><strong>Building roadmaps around outcomes, not features. </strong>This gives your team the agility to adapt to one of the umpteen pathways that could be used to arrive at the desired outcome. Outcome-focused roadmaps also ensure that the team focuses on solving the problem at hand and not just checking stories off a to-do list.</li><li><strong>Make clarity your top priority. </strong>Be it through initial research, alpha releases, or targeted experiments, your first three months should focus on validating your assumptions. These will help you plan a more robust roadmap, rather than building a product on ideas made of sand.</li><li><strong>Use the 666 method. </strong>A way of mapping horizons based on what your startup needs to focus on over the next <strong>6 years, 6 months, and 6 weeks</strong>.</li></ol><ul><li><strong>Next 6 years. </strong>This is your north star, the team’s vision of the future six years from now. This will change and evolve as your team learns how your product is built, adopted, and integrated into your users’ lives. Please do not create a fixed plan for six years.</li><li><strong>Next 6 months. </strong>This is your pathway of putting the product in front of your users for the very first time. It is a culmination of all your current beliefs, learnings and insights. The team should assume that only 50–60% of this plan will actually get built. The rest will emerge based on what you discover along the way, creating a need to revisit and revise this plan every couple of months.</li><li><strong>Next 6 weeks. </strong>This is where a feature roadmap makes sense. Once your team is confident on what needs to be built next, create a small, focused plan. Once locked in, changes here should be minimal. Make sure you know what you want to learn from the outcome of these six weeks. <strong>This is the only horizon where going granular is appropriate.</strong></li></ul><p><em>Lastly, learn to </em><strong><em>balance</em></strong><em> and </em><strong><em>realign</em></strong><em>. Planning works best when delivery and discovery are mapped together, each informing and correcting the other.</em></p><p>References:</p><ul><li>Yojji: Roadmap Startup Guide &amp; Examples: <a href=""https://yojji.io/blog/roadmap-startup-guide-examples"">https://yojji.io/blog/roadmap-startup-guide-examples</a></li><li>Clarify: The Art of Product Roadmapping for Early-Stage SaaS Founders: <a href=""https://www.clarify.ai/blog/the-art-of-product-roadmapping-for-early-stage-saas-founders"">https://www.clarify.ai/blog/the-art-of-product-roadmapping-for-early-stage-saas-founders</a></li><li>Product School: Now–Next–Later Roadmap Framework: <a href=""https://productschool.com/blog/product-strategy/now-next-later-roadmap"">https://productschool.com/blog/product-strategy/now-next-later-roadmap</a></li><li>Product plan: Product roadmaps for startups vs enterprises: <a href=""https://www.productplan.com/learn/product-roadmaps-startups-versus-enterprises/"">https://www.productplan.com/learn/product-roadmaps-startups-versus-enterprises/</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9360d392758b"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/why-feature-roadmaps-dont-work-for-early-stage-startups-9360d392758b"">Why feature roadmaps don’t work for early-stage startups</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

They scale a product people don’t love, solve problems users don’t have, and burn resources on ineffective experiments.</p><p>Let’s take a look at Workday, it’s a powerful HR and finance platform often criticized for its frustrating user experience, especially in the job application process. You guys, who’s ever tried Workday? We might know this isn’t an isolated issue. The Baymard Institute found that nearly 70% of online shopping carts are abandoned, largely due to poor UX.</p><p>This is the exact problem Product-Led Growth (PLG) aims to solve. In simple terms, PLG means your product itself becomes the primary engine for user acquisition, conversion, and retention. It’s a philosophy that forces design, marketing, sales, and engineering to align around the user experience. Often, this activity proceeds by a growth team who orchestrates but the skeleton is strategy + user experience.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6tb4w2wxyLCitsGdRh_0Dw.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://share.google/7WzjN5Ur51rKjUsEm""><em>The Product-Led Prism</em></a><em> by </em>www.productled.org</figcaption></figure><p>But there’s a catch.</p><h4><strong>The Foundation: Product-Market Fit</strong></h4><p>A business can only focus on true, scalable growth after achieving product-market fit. Without it, growth activities just scatter your efforts instead of driving focus, and accelerate failure.</p><p>So, how can you tell if your business has reached product–market fit?</p><p>It certainly shows up in terms of happier customers, lower churn rates, shortened sales cycles, and rapid organic growth. But the threshold for any of these can be tough to define.</p><p>For Pre-Product</p><ul><li>Visible excitement: “…we were getting literal love letters”</li><li>Someone’s pupils dilate when they use your stuff</li><li>People are wiling to pay for it now</li></ul><p>For Post-Product</p><ul><li>Retention: Users stick around.

Scaling beforehand is like building a skyscraper on sand.</p><h4><strong>The Pitfall: Confusing Speed with Strength</strong></h4><p>The pressure to grow fast, especially in early-stage startups, can be deafening. But speed without direction leads to failure.</p><p>An experienced business strategist, Yulia Neicovcean, illustrates two scenarios:</p><blockquote>“…</blockquote><blockquote>Scenario 1: Growth That Lasts</blockquote><blockquote>Companies decided early to build structure solid CRM, client retention strategies, and a focus on prime communities. They didn’t try to do everything. They specialized. As the market shifted, their brand held strong, and they kept growing steadily instead of burning out.</blockquote><blockquote>Scenario 2: Failure in Fast-Forward</blockquote><blockquote>Another company scaled aggressively hiring quickly, chasing every new trend, ignoring compliance and fundamentals. For a year it looked like they were unstoppable. But when regulations tightened and clients demanded quality over quantity, the cracks showed. Within two years, they went from “the next big thing” to closing their doors.</blockquote><blockquote>The lesson is clear:</blockquote><blockquote>Growth is not proof of success; sustainability is. “</blockquote><p>This is where two powerful frameworks come together to create a solution.</p><p><strong>1. McKinsey’s Three Horizons of Growth: The Strategic Compass</strong></p><p>The McKinsey Three Horizons model first introduced in The Alchemy of Growth (1999) remains a valuable tool for prioritizing innovation. However, its traditional interpretation has a critical blind spot in the digital age.</p><p>The original model suggests that disruptive innovations (Horizon 3) emerge from long research and development cycles. While this is still true for fields like biotech or energy, the modern trap is failing to recognize that today’s most powerful disruptions often skip this lengthy phase.</p><p>Instead, they are achieved by repurposing existing, mature technologies — like cloud computing, APIs, and mobile platforms — into radical new business models. This is where strategy and user experience intersect:</p><ul><li><strong>Disruption Lies in Business Model &amp; UX: </strong>Companies like Uber, Airbnb, and Instagram didn’t invent new core technologies (GPS, online payments, photo-sharing). They leveraged existing ones to create a fundamentally superior and seamless user experience, which in turn defined a new business model.</li><li><strong>Speed as a Disruptive Force: </strong>The ability to rapidly deploy these experience-driven models creates a powerful advantage. A competitor stuck in the old Horizon 3 mindset is still in R&amp;D, while a UX-focused competitor has already captured the market.</li></ul><p>Therefore, the framework is still useful for categorizing ambitions, but its value for planning disruption is limited. Its full potential is only unlocked when integrated with a deep understanding of how existing technology can be reimagined through user-centric design to create immediate, market-changing value.</p><p><strong>The model guides you to balance your focus across three time horizons:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Horizon 1 (H1): Your Core Business. </strong>This is what pays the bills today. Initiatives here focus on optimizing, defending, and growing your existing operations (e.g., improving checkout conversion rates).</li><li><strong>Horizon 2 (H2): Emerging Opportunities. </strong>These are new ventures that are expected to become your core business in the next 1–3 years (e.g., launching a new product line or entering a new market).</li><li><strong>Horizon 3 (H3): Future Bets. </strong>These are long-term ideas and experiments that could define your future (e.g., R&amp;D for a disruptive technology).</li></ul><p>The failed company in Scenario 2 was likely chasing H3 dreams without a profitable H1 foundation. A sustainable strategy requires actively managing all three.</p><p><strong>2. UXR as a Product Discovery Mindset: The Reality Check</strong></p><p>As Marty Cagan notes in his book INSPIRED, “<em>The few that succeed are usually those that are really good at the product discovery phase</em>.” This is where User Experience Research (UXR) evolves from a mere task into a core mindset.</p><p>It’s the continuous practice of asking:</p><ul><li>“Are we solving the right problem?”</li><li>“Will users actually use this?”</li><li>“Can we build a viable business around it?”</li></ul><p>This UXR mindset is the solution to the “Three Horizons trap.” It replaces long, risky R&amp;D cycles in H3 with a culture of continuous learning, ensuring strategy is guided by evidence from the very beginning.</p><p>This isn’t about occasional testing, it’s about rapidly identifying hidden opportunities to repurpose our existing technologies to solve real user problems with the right analysis. This approach enables the fast, asymmetric disruptions that define modern, sustainable growth.</p><p>This is why I created the Sustainable Growth Flowchart. It’s a practical map that combines these two frameworks, ensuring every growth initiative is grounded in both strategic business planning and user reality.</p><h3><strong>The Sustainable Growth Flowchart: </strong>The Intersection of Business Strategy and User Experience</h3><p>For downloadable file: <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W4pklZ8LLiq68oFk2M32W3cekI-YxhgN/view?usp=drive_link"">check here</a></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Wy-LruGuoDkG0x0dZt4f5Q.png"" /><figcaption>The Intersection of Business Strategy and User Experience — By Lismayasari Annisyah</figcaption></figure><p>Let’s walk through the key decision gates. The entire process is a cycle, governed by ‘Monitor, Measure, and Adapt.’</p><ol><li>Begin with a Ruthless Audit: Defining the Right Problem</li></ol><p>The flowchart starts here because launching into solutions without validating the core problem is a fundamental failure mode in UX and product design. This step embodies a user research (UXR) mindset, systematically deconstructing assumptions through methods such as analytics review, user interviews, surveys, competitive analysis, or journey mapping. The term “ruthless” signifies a commitment to brutal honesty and a willingness to kill ideas if data reveals they are misaligned or ineffective. This audit is not a one-time event; it’s a process for uncovering latent opportunities, such as unmet user needs that could drive retention or acquisition.</p><p>I watched Melanie Perkins, Co-founder and CEO of Canva, explain in Founder Story interviews that their core mission was to “democratize design” making design accessible to non-designers rather than simply adding features to complex tools. Through user research and analytics, they refined the problem statement, which led to a simplified interface and increased adoption among users who were not design experts.</p><p>As I’m in a SaaS product, this might involve auditing my onboarding flow. If drop-off rates are high, user interviews could uncover confusing UX patterns, prompting a redesign that aligns with users’ mental models. Incorporating tools like heatmaps (e.g., Hotjar) is one of many methods that can be used to help identify cognitive biases in our assumptions, ensuring the problem is validated by users (the right problem), not ego-driven.</p><p>2. The First Critical Gate: Product-Market Fit (PMF)</p><p>This is the flowchart’s decisive checkpoint: “Have we achieved Product-Market Fit?” If not, the directive is to return to research; scaling is not permitted. PMF means your product solves a real problem for a well-defined market so effectively that users become habitual adopters. UXR verifies this by connecting to problem/solution fit, GAP analysis, value proposition clarity, Bayesian analysis, or mixed-method research. Also, see metrics like retention, churn rates, or any metrics that fit our business type. Bypassing this gate means investing resources into what the flowchart calls a “broken engine.”</p><p>I read ‘The Slack Origin Story’ by Techcrunch, they explained that Slack serves as a classic example, as it pivoted from a gaming tool to a team communication platform after internal data showed skyrocketing adoption within their own team. Early PMF was validated through strong engagement metrics and user feedback, which justified scaling efforts. Regarding this, UX people can conduct cohort analysis, if users return daily and refer others, you likely have PMF.</p><p>If not, iterate on core features using qualitative insights, bayesian analysis, the buyer’s/user journey, or any method that can map the system.</p><p>We maybe familiar with Airbnb, they achieved PMF by focusing on high-quality photos and trust-building UX elements, converting skeptical users into advocates. This gate prevents startups from burning capital on unvalidated ideas, reinforcing user experience as the foundation of market resonance.</p><p>3. Set Goals and Select Your Lever: Balancing Growth Strategies</p><p>Once PMF is confirmed, the flowchart directs you to establish measurable goals such as KPIs for user acquisition or churn reduction and choose appropriate growth levers. This draws on the Ansoff Matrix: Market Penetration (deepening engagement within existing markets), Product Development (building new features for current users), Market Development (bringing existing products to new markets), or Diversification (launching new products in new markets). It’s critical to align these with strategic time horizons: H1 (short-term optimization), H2 (medium-term expansion), and H3 (long-term innovation) ensuring sustainability without overextending resources. This means UX practitioners can recommend a lever prioritize that enhance user delight, while the company sets up strategic resource allocation.</p><p>Spotify as our favorite music player, for instance, they employed Product Development (H2) by introducing personalized playlists, which increased retention among existing users, while also pursuing Market Penetration (H1) through free-tier offerings in new regions.</p><p>For example, if we have a goal to double user growth, we might choose Market Penetration via UX improvements like a seamless referral program while investing in H3 diversification such as AI-powered features.</p><p>Quartr.com explained that Netflix successfully diversified into original content (H3) after saturating its core streaming market, using data to guide decisions. This balanced approach avoids the “growth at all costs” trap, ensuring UX drives long-term value.</p><p>4. The Alignment Check: The PLG Litmus Test</p><p>Before execution, the flowchart mandates asking: “Are cross-functional teams aligned and adequately funded?” This step operationalizes Product-Led Growth (PLG), where the product itself through intuitive UX drives acquisition, conversion, and expansion, reducing reliance on heavy sales tactics. If marketing, design, engineering, or other teams are not synchronized, the process loops back. This prevents siloed efforts that undermine initiatives. Designers need this alignment to ensure UX remains central. Also, it means funding experiments with clear ownership.</p><p>Ruben Dominguez wrote about The Rise of PLG, explaining that Dropbox mastered PLG by making file-sharing so effortless that users naturally invited others, with cross-functional teams iterating based on evidance and the right problem. Let’s check our business, If your PLG test fails, evidenced by a low viral coefficient, it may stem from misalignment. For example, researcher deliver insights and recommendations about, but marketing have different definition about the findings. Also, design may advocate for user testing, but engineering lacks the resources to implement changes.</p><p>Grammarly is another example: cross-functional alignment around a freemium UX model fueled viral growth without significant marketing spend. This can be initiated by the product, research, or growth department. This check is especially critical in startups, where limited budgets amplify the cost of misalignment.</p><p>The entire process is cyclical, governed by ‘Monitor, Measure, and Adapt, and back to monitor because sustainable growth is never a one-and-done effort.”</p><p>The entire process is cyclical, governed by ‘Monitor, Measure, and Adapt, and back to monitor because sustainable growth is never a one-and-done effort.”</p><h4><strong>As it’s never a one-and-done effort, what’s the truth about business growth?</strong></h4><p>Scaling a business and achieving exponential growth isn’t something impossible. Even though it’s difficult, it can be achieved when a business truly has the right strategy, the right execution, and the right focus.</p><p>It’s also important to understand what actually slows down business growth whether it’s the team, the system, the strategy, or even the mindset and inaccurate knowledge that shape every decision.</p><p>Oh, I know. It’s so easy to say things like, “Just check your business issues, solve them, and you’ll have sustainable growth!”</p><p>Sometimes you already have high-quality services, a brilliant system, and strategic marketing but the real issue is in our mindset or even our immaturity.</p><p>But the good news is: we can always learn, unlearn, and relearn anything.</p><h4><strong>Key reminders for designer growth focused</strong></h4><p>What I’ve learned from my own reflections and insights from product leaders:</p><p>1. Set clear goals; for the day, the week, the month, and the year.</p><p>2. Investigate deeply; look for real opportunities and make sure you’re solving the right problem.</p><p>3. Experiment and iterate; explore concepts with scalability potential or take calculated risks.</p><ul><li>Apply the right product design principles</li><li>Use the right UI patterns and UX laws that work</li><li>Read and interpret data clearly</li><li>Choose effective methods and define the right metrics</li></ul><p>4. Be aware of design responsibility; always consider the impact on both users and the business. Ethics matter.</p><p>Sustainable growth demands both strategic discipline and user-centered insight. Speed alone is not strength. Strength comes from clarity, reflection, and responsible execution.</p><p>My flowchart is not a final answer, but a guide a tool for reflection and decision-making. It exists to replace guesswork with a disciplined, evidence-driven system.</p><p>Now, ask yourself:</p><p>Where does your product currently stand? And what is one growth initiative you could pressure-test with this flowchart today?</p><p><strong>If you’ve walked this path before and have a story to tell, I’d really love to hear it.</strong></p><p>Thank you for being curious! 🌱</p><p><strong>More details findout here</strong></p><ol><li><a href=""https://productmindset.substack.com/p/mckinseys-three-horizons-model"">Mckinsey Three Horizon Models by Product Mindset</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/the-truth-about-achieving-exponential-growth-in-business/470281"">The truth about acjieving business growth by Entrepreneurs</a></li><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/growth-design-the-fusion-of-business-and-user-experience-2ce78e7c5d59"">Growth design: The fusion of business and UX Design by Justin Gupta</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.svpg.com/books/inspired-how-to-create-tech-products-customers-love-2nd-edition/"">Inspired book by Marty Cagan</a></li><li><a href=""https://share.google/HYjdn0CBcWEnEM9AP"">What is Product Led Growth?</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-to-know-if-youve-got-productmarket"">How to know if you’ve got product-market fit by Lenny</a></li><li>The slack origin story <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/the-slack-origin-story/"">https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/the-slack-origin-story/</a></li><li><a href=""https://journal.scimadly.com/index.php/jpmb/article/view/116?hl=en-GB"">The Influence of Digital Changes on Media And Entertainment Business Models: A Case Study of Netflix and Spotify</a></li><li><a href=""https://quartr.com/insights/edge/inside-netflix-innovation-originals-and-cultural-phenomena?hl=en-GB"">Inside Netflix: Innovation, Originals, and Cultural Phenomena</a></li><li><a href=""https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-10-13/adding-that-extra-you-to-your-discovery-oskar-stal-spotify-vice-president-of-personalization-explains-how-it-works/?hl=en-GB"">Adding That Extra ‘You’ to Your Discovery: Oskar Stål, Spotify Vice President of Personalization, Explains How It Works</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.thevccorner.com/p/what-happened-to-growth-hacking-the"">The Evolution of Growth Hacking in 2025</a></li></ol><p>Hi, I’m Lisma, a designer-thinker who loves to help brands and the product solve the right problem and find growth opportunities for acquisition, activation, retention, and revenue | UX researcher | Ex: Marketing partner and build creative-marketing agency</p><p><em>Feel free to connect on </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/lismaya07?utm_source=share&amp;utm_campaign=share_via&amp;utm_content=profile&amp;utm_medium=android_app""><em>Linkedin</em></a></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=7436e687037d"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/sustainable-growth-flowchart-7436e687037d"">Sustainable growth flowchart</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<p>When it comes to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/j-shape-haircut-trend"">haircut trends</a>, the choice is overwhelming, but if we had to crown one cut as the current style du jour, it would be <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/12/11823303/bob-haircut-trends-2025"">the bob</a>. </p>



<p>Its versatility is what gives <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/kicked-bob-haircut-trend"">the bob</a> an edge over other cuts. Want to go really short? Consider <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/summer-haircut-trends-2025"">the bixie</a>, aka bob-meets-pixie. Worried about losing too much length? Try <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/butterfly-lob-haircut-trend"">the lob</a>, or long bob. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg, because hairstylists from London to Los Angeles are dreaming up new iterations of the cut daily — and we predict that, in 2026, there’ll be no escaping the temptation to brave the scissors.</p>



<p>With that in mind, scroll ahead for the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/choppy-bob-haircut-trend"">bob haircut trends</a> top stylists predict will reign supreme in 2026 and beyond.</p>

<p>Hairstylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/georgecurranhair/?hl=en"">George Curran</a> bills the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/korean-two-in-one-haircut-trend"">Korean bob</a> as one of the most exciting haircut innovations. “The cut is designed so you can have a bob when your hair is tied or clipped up, and long hair when it’s worn down,” says Curren. It’s literally two hairstyles in one. “No extensions and all without committing to losing your length,” adds Curran. “It’s a clever optical illusion haircut using a specialist Korean cutting technique, and it’s perfect for anyone who wants versatility without compromise.” This video posted to Instagram by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DHhiQfwy0fw/?hl=en"">Timothy Ting</a> is mesmerizing. </p>

<p>“This blends charm and delicacy with a modern and lived-in edge,” says Devin Graciano is a professional hairstylist and CEO of <a href=""https://goldielocks.com/"">Goldie Locks</a>. She adds, “The style is lightweight, soft, and full of movement, which gives it that effortless, airy feel,” — but it boasts attitude and intention, too. “The bixie complements the playful and confident person who wears it,” says Graciano. “It’s a cut that feels both current and timeless, with room for personalization depending on texture and personality.” This cut <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DF0IrRkRFc7/?hl=en"">by Jordz</a> is perfect. </p>

<p>Curly hair specialist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/curlvision/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dusty Schlabach</a> predicts that the blunt curly bob will be everywhere. “It’s a zero-layer, ultra-clean blunt bob that sits right at the chin,” says Schlabach, adding, “It’s perfect for medium to low-density curls because it keeps the shape sleek without stacking or creating that Christmas tree effect at the baseline” — no triangular shapes here. Instead, the silhouette is “intentional,” says Schlabach, who suggests asking your stylist to cut your curls dry, exactly in their natural pattern. “Think a straight-across blunt line and no layers — just the slightest, almost invisible A-line so it sits clean at the chin,” says Schlabach. This cut on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DK2gbfBIrVs/?img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nadine Koca</a> is beautiful.</p>

<p>Rather than a clean, blunt line, the ends of the shattered bob are point-cut or “shattered” by slicing into the hair vertically to create a “choppy, airy, slightly fragmented finish,” says Curran, like this look on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DKNboCxibT3/?img_index=1"">Pam Mlunjwana</a>. “It has that effortless, undone vibe,” he continues. But make no mistake: “It’s a very technical cut that relies on precision and the right styling products.” Layering is essential to add movement, says Curran. “You want the hair to have body and flow, without slipping into that helmet-like shape. I remove a lot of weight through the layers, particularly around the [back], which gives the cut bounce and stops it feeling heavy or bulky.”</p>



<p>Curran says the shattered bob looks best when it’s relaxed and a little tousled. “That cool-girl, lived-in texture feels intentional but never overdone.

<p>When Curran thinks of a French bob, the words classic, timeless, and iconic spring to his mind. “In 2025, we saw this style evolve with softer layering around the face,” he says. “But as we head into 2026, it’s all about a more grown-out, effortless version of the look,” like this one by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/C8txZwFMmA6/?img_index=1"">Faick Zekai</a>. According to Curran, it stays sophisticated thanks to a strong, heavy finish through the ends and very minimal layering throughout.</p>

<p>Coined by Graciano, the liquid bob is a “sleek, softly sculpted bob with seamless layers and polished ends that move like fluid.” It’s glossy, weightless, and intentionally refined, she adds. Simply ask your stylist for a “blunt-to-soft perimeter bob,” advises Graciano, complete with subtle internal layering. “Wearing it blow-dried smooth emphasizes shine and swing,” says Graciano.

<p>The bubble bob — aka rounded layered curly bob, according to Schlabach — is the total opposite of the aforementioned blunt bob. “This cut uses soft, intentional layers to create a rounder, more lifted shape that distributes weight evenly,” says Schlabach. “It’s ideal for dense curls that tend to build bulk at the bottom because the layers prevent heaviness and open up movement throughout the shape.” </p>

<p>The cowgirl bob has a strong ’90s influence, says Curran. “I think it’s going to be a big evolution from the French bob or the blunt, one-length, ultra-polished look à la Sofia Richie-Grainge,” he adds. The cowgirl bob has a few defining attributes: “It’s softer, shaggier, and more relaxed — for those who don’t want a super-sleek finish and prefer a bit more movement and natural texture.” Curran points to Alexa Chung as inspiration. “What I love most is how bespoke you can make it,” adds Curran. “You can tailor it completely to the client and frame the face with soft or grown-out bangs.”</p>



<p>To style it, Curran recommends using a curling iron to create a subtle kick through the ends. “This will enhance that relaxed, cowgirl-inspired movement,” he says. “I always finish with <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/LOr%C3%A9al-TecniArt-Panache-250ml-spray/dp/B07Q75GPTZ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2UNY5RX8L9Z1X&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.p9Dv2Em9KZ1dUuI0qurdCujclzhhzAyGiM37bmtAoSponvWcc6JMQfFW4ReafeK-15dJPdym1YQ9OQvrEVhyMYm41nwHab4lmw28sT1dwxT_FCQ3csuUtaKR5N-k4XLO1BQUR-YsN_ELojTrixV6rjgC66SwDg07Iekz87DrFn7RRt-BvH0yaJplQxCV6v8XsZXroBvUmUZUcI9oE12fr4zep0cLhz6OrQHUnezjdwlO3ULOUh38PY4NQq-yT3Gak9uJAR8Kn9xbn0mODyi1OEDPRLXr-StUPynDMkv9bXM.n-meX568iOuMTSxmPeqJSf-gb0exmG0f1d0m-ivdQIw&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=L%E2%80%99Or%C3%A9al+Professionnel+Tecni+Art+Volume+Panache&amp;qid=1765471158&amp;sprefix=l+or%C3%A9al+professionnel+tecni+art+volume+panache%2Caps%2C81&amp;sr=8-1"">L’Oréal Professionnel Tecni Art Volume Panache</a> to keep the texture airy and full of body.

<p>This is a rounded, gently layered bob, which Graciano says is designed to enhance natural texture. “It keeps the shape airy and controlled, never bulky,” she says — just like this cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DSH36HMDITs/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Faick Zekai</a>. “Ask your stylist for a bob that hits between the jaw and collarbone, with light internal layering and curl-by-curl shaping to maintain softness and movement.”</p>

<p>Brace yourselves: the pob, aka the pixie bob, is making a comeback — and Curran predicts it’ll be one of the standout cuts of 2026. “Think Scarlett Johansson circa 2015 or Victoria Beckham in her 2007 Posh bob era,” says Curran. He adds, “We’re seeing a real shift towards shapes that feel more architectural yet still wearable, and this cut ticks every box. I love the contrast it creates: one side sharp and cropped, the other slightly longer, sweeping, and sculpted.” Even better, Curran says it’s the ideal next step for anyone with a ’90s bob who wants to go shorter. “It’s bold, low-maintenance, and super stylish.” We adore this cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DMLMojRRPcg/?img_index=1"">Sheridan Holyoak</a>. </p>

<p>Schlabach says that the curly lob, or long bob, is a slightly longer version of the bubble and blunt curly bobs. “It’s a shoulder-grazing cut that keeps length while maintaining structure,” adds Schlabach, “and it’s often paired with thoughtful face-framing or a soft veil bang to open up the front and create natural movement.” Thanks to the additional few inches, this style works well across most curl types and densities, says Schlabach.

December is more than just the holidays. It’s also the beginning of the winter arc. If you’re unfamiliar, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/winter-arc-tiktok-fitness-self-improvement"">winter arc</a> is a social trend centered on building healthy, grounding habits during the colder months. For some, that looks like locking in: doing a full physical and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/digital-decluttering-how-to"">digital declutter</a>, taking a financial audit of your 2025 plans, or creating a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/taylor-cassidy-vision-boarding"">vision board</a> for 2026. Meanwhile, others are embracing a slower hibernation mode, like reading that final book on your TBR list, easing into restorative routines, or slowly crocheting a seasonal sweater.<br /><br />Whatever the approach, it’s all a form of preparation for the year ahead, another 365 days filled with opportunities, challenges, and moments of inspiration to plan for and look forward to. While it’s true that the seconds between December 31, 2025 and January 1, 2026 won’t magically transform our lives, there is a shift in energy that takes place. One that invites us to reflect on our wins, acknowledge the lessons, and give ourselves permission to start fresh in the new year.<br /><br />And while you don’t need anything fancy to tap into that New Year energy, there are tools that can make it easier to manifest, plan, organize, and track your progress. Below, we’re sharing stationery picks, motivational prints, and energy-clearing essentials to help you step confidently into your next chapter.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

Palo santo, a fragrant wood traditionally used in South America, is known for its warm, resinous scent and its ability to create a grounding atmosphere. When burned, it releases a gentle aroma that instantly shifts the tone of a room. Incan cultures believed it offered medicinal and therapeutic benefits, like purifying spaces, and many continue to use it to cleanse and reset. Peruvian-owned lifestyle brand Luna Sundara works with local artisans who sustainably harvest high-quality Palo Santo smudging sticks.<br /><br /><strong>Luna Sundara</strong> Luna Sundara’s Palo Santo Smudging Sticks, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lunasundara.com%2Fcollections%2Fpalo-santo%2Fproducts%2Fluna-sundara-palo-santo-smudging-sticks-from-peru-sustainably-harvested-quality-hand-picked-100-grams-approx-25-sticks&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Flock-in-tools-2026"">Luna Sundara</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1420"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11949367.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1146&amp;height=1420&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=573:710"" width=""1146"" /><figcaption><strong>Bella Doña’s 2026 Planner<br /></strong><br />Next, get organized.

It’s also about self-discovery and deepening your relationship with yourself. It’s gaining clarity on who you are, your values, your interests, and your boundaries. It’s understanding what you want out of your life, not just your career or finances. It’s about reflecting, growing, and preserving the memories that matter most to you. The intimate, safe, free writing that comes with journaling makes it one of the easiest, most powerful, and inexpensive ways to do this.

Certain scents, like rosemary, peppermint, or eucalyptus, have been shown to improve alertness and concentration, while others, like citrus, vanilla, or lavender, are known to reduce stress and elevate mood. Whatever your preference or need, tapping into the power of scent can help you lock in.
