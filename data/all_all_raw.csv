<p>Set on the edge of the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/mediterranean"">Mediterranean</a> and shaped by centuries of continuous occupation, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/naples"">Naples</a> is a city where architecture is inseparable from time.

<p><strong>Inspirations and key concepts</strong> -  The project was inspired by Holcim's core material and identity: cement.

<p>Shell House is a residential project that reimagines the traditional courtyard home through the language of softness, light, and spatial layering. Located on a corner plot in Kuwait, the design draws inspiration from the organic morphology of a shell—protective on the outside, open and nurturing on the inside. At its heart lies a lush, intimate courtyard with a pool, visible from the home's primary living spaces and home gym, establishing the courtyard as both a literal and conceptual anchor. The architecture wraps gently around this core, with a series of soft curves that define the building's form and guide the spatial experience throughout.</p>",

<figure><img alt=""A glasses with floating UI on it. AI-Generated image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RDWf03gEFMyyNtIVGJpa2g.jpeg"" /><figcaption>AI-generated image based on the original from this article <a href=""https://www.queppelin.com/ar-glasses-for-navigation/"">https://www.queppelin.com/ar-glasses-for-navigation/</a></figcaption></figure><p>When I talk about AR glasses, I don’t mean bulky headsets. I mean devices that look like regular eyewear capable of whispering information into your ear and displaying 3D content or flat panels overlaid on the real world.</p><p>This article is neither a validation of the technology nor a criticism, it is an objective personal look at what I see coming. Here are five reasons why I believe AR glasses will succeed and become mainstream, along with the consequences designers and users must face.</p><h3>1. Solving the “Kidnapped Body” problem</h3><figure><img alt=""An illustration of a woman looking at the phone. AI-Generated image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Kv1QO5wUplFqomrm1QmdGg.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Mobile devices demand a high physical price. They force us to look down, occupy our hands, and monopolize our attention. I call this the “kidnapped body” problem. We pay this price without thinking, but the implications are profound. It severs us from the physical world, blocking out views, people, and genuine connection.</p><p>We have even developed medical terms for this. “<a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11856789/"">Tech Neck</a>” describes the repetitive stress injury caused by constantly looking down at a screen. AR glasses may succeed because they liberate the body. They return our hands to us and, more importantly, they lift our chins. By allowing us to look up and ahead, they reintegrate us into the world. While they will for sure introduce new distractions, the shift from “head-down” to “heads-up” computing is a fundamental ergonomic correction that users will gravitate toward.</p><h3>2. The new, no-new device</h3><figure><img alt=""A woman smiling grabbing her glasses. AI-Generated image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zGXPyqrNH8iLmzgZrqIbKw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>In a gadget-saturated world, introducing a completely new device is risky. However, AR glasses have a secret weapon. They aren’t “new.” They are just glasses.</p><p>Global estimates suggest around <a href=""https://www.overnightglasses.com/eyewear-industry-statistics/#:~:text=Globally%2C%20at%20least%202.2%20billion,for%202023%20was%20$65.6%20billion."">4 billion people already wear glasses</a> for various reasons, with over <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/blindness-and-visual-impairment"">2.2 billion people having a near or distance vision impairment</a> according to the World Health Organization. The form factor is familiar, socially accepted, and worn daily. The friction to adoption is incredibly low compared to a VR headset. Much like the Apple Watch which sold 12 million units in its breakout year by leveraging the centuries-old habit of wearing wristwatches. As long as they look like iconic eyewear rather than tech hardware, they are primed for mass adoption.</p><h3>3. The Spatial Canvas (Escaping the Screen)</h3><figure><img alt=""An illustration of a busy street seen from the perspective of a person with AR glasses. The street is full of floating user interface. AI-Generated image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*a-BfGo5NIZp_uzQbQHmxCg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>AI-generated image based on the original from this article <a href=""https://www.crunchfish.com/how-does-the-world-look-through-smart-glasses/"">https://www.crunchfish.com/how-does-the-world-look-through-smart-glasses/</a></figcaption></figure><p>There is a multi-million-dollar industry currently trapped behind 6-inch glass rectangles. Tech giants from phone manufacturers to app developers are hitting the limits of what can be done on a 2D flat screen.</p><p>The physical world is a “green field” for these companies, a massive, unclaimed canvas for digital overlay. Whether we like it or not, the push to colonize our surroundings with digital content is the next logical growth engine for the tech sector.</p><p>For product designers, this represents the most significant paradigm shift ever seen. We are moving from designing within a constrained frame to designing without borders. Eventually, we will no longer design apps that “trap” users, we will design apps that enhance the environment. This shift to “Spatial Computing” will unlock entirely new economies and user behaviors that flat screens simply cannot support.</p><h3>4. Use Cases</h3><figure><img alt=""A floating user interface seen from inside a car. AI-Generated image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dDpTz4QCVcDT2OR8tmirpA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>AI-generated image based on the original from this article <a href=""https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/envisics-ar-windshield-technology/"">https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/envisics-ar-windshield-technology/</a></figcaption></figure><p>The utility of placing digital objects into the physical world is undeniable. While current iterations act as a Heads-Up Display (HUD) rather than fully immersive AR, they are the necessary bridge to the future.</p><p>Apps designed for physical interaction will thrive first:</p><ul><li><strong>Exploration and Learning:</strong> This is perhaps the strongest long-term use case. You could stand in front of a historical monument and instantly see contextual history overlaid on the stone. You could look at a complex car engine and see step-by-step repair labels pointing to the exact parts you need to touch. It turns the entire world into an interactive learning manual.</li><li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Arrows overlaid on the street as you walk, allowing you to converse with friends without checking a phone map.</li><li><strong>Cooking:</strong> Hands-free recipes floating above the counter.</li><li><strong>Safety:</strong> The ability to livestream to emergency services instantly during dangerous situations could be a significant deterrent to crime.</li><li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> For users with disabilities, these glasses can provide real-time context, enhance visual contrast, or narrate the environment instantly empowering users without requiring active intervention.</li></ul><p>As product designers we can already start exploring how to design for AR glasses in Google’s documentation for instance, in this <a href=""https://design.google/library/transparent-screens"">article</a>, David Allan Reese talks about how to design with daylight, UI components sizes, contrast, space awareness and more. You can also take a look at how Google’s AR UI kit, <a href=""https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/jetpack-xr-sdk/jetpack-compose-glimmer"">Jetpack Compose Glimmer</a>, looks like. On the other hand, Meta has also released its <a href=""https://wearables.developer.meta.com/docs/develop"">documentation </a>about developing and designing for Ray-Ban Meta Glasses.</p><h3>5. The Renaissance of Voice</h3><figure><img alt=""An illustration of a woman with an AR glasses touching the right side of them simulating touching the volume. Some sound player UI floating next to the hand. AI-Generated image"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mEhRbXCbvv-XrjkMYjF2kg.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Historically, conversational interfaces have suffered from poor reputations. They were often frustrating and limited. However, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has fundamentally changed this.</p><p>Conversational AI is becoming natural, instant, and context-aware very fast. When you combine competent AI with the “hands-free” nature of glasses, voice becomes a crucial input system. The social awkwardness of talking to a device will likely fade, much like how wearing wireless earbuds 24/7 went from “rude” to “normal.”</p><h3>The Consequences</h3><p>If this technology succeeds, we must be prepared for two major friction points, particularly from a design perspective:</p><p><strong>1. The Privacy Paradox</strong> Privacy concerns run in two directions. First, what are manufacturers capturing about our daily lives? Second, how do we manage peer-to-peer privacy? The “always-on” camera creates uneasiness in social settings. How will society regulate recording in public? Will hacking the “recording LED” become common? These social contracts will need to be rewritten, and many users may reject the tech simply to opt out of this surveillance state.</p><p><strong>2. Spatial Invasion and New UX Patterns</strong> If the world becomes a digital canvas, who owns the rights to that space? We risk a future of “spatial spam” ads anchored to physical storefronts, landmarks, or even sidewalks. Without strict regulation, the tranquility of the real world could be interrupted by pop-ups and notifications that we cannot swipe away.</p><p>For designers, this raises critical ethical questions. What is the “dark pattern” of spatial reality? How do we design an “opt-out” mechanism for the real world? We will likely see the rise of aggressive attention-grabbing patterns that physically block your view until acknowledged. Designers will have the heavy responsibility of defining the etiquette of this new layer. Will we design respectful interfaces that blend in, or intrusive billboards that demand attention? We may not see the regulations put in place until after the intrusion has already begun.</p><h3>To wrap up</h3><p>AR glasses introduce a new reality literally, bringing with them as many opportunities as there are threads of concern. For product designers, the challenge is not just to be ahead of the trend, but to deeply understand what this technology adds to or subtracts from human life.</p><p>Personally, I am fascinated by a future enhanced by this technology, a life where reality is augmented to help and delight us. However, I remain cautious. We have seen how initial excitement can turn into unforeseen consequences. Social media reminds us of how a tool for connection can evolve into a mental health crisis. By the time we realized the damage, it was already too late for some generations.</p><p>I believe in the power of individual common sense, but I also know that mass adoption shifts behavior in unpredictable ways. I hope this article has sparked your interest and encouraged you to investigate further. We are facing a fascinating technological horizon, and it is up to us, designers and users, to ensure it remains a tool for human enhancement rather than distraction.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=69fb46013816"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/5-reasons-why-ar-glasses-are-inevitable-69fb46013816"">5 Reasons why AR glasses are inevitable</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>AI doesn’t just reflect human bias. It amplifies it through everyday use, quietly shaping judgement, trust, and decisions.</h4><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a person from behind, holding a pen thoughtfully while reviewing two stacks of CVs on a wooden desk. One stack is labelled “AI” and the other “Colleague.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tIC7DvEr9qL6ZqaiHrcYcw.png"" /><figcaption>Image generated by author</figcaption></figure><p>You’re halfway through a stack of job applications, AI assistant humming along beside you, flagging promising candidates like an eager intern. It disagrees with your gut feeling about one applicant. You pause. Reconsider. A few screens later, it disagrees again. You change your mind once more. By the end of the session, you’ve deferred to its judgment on nearly a third of the decisions where you initially felt confident.</p><p>Now swap the algorithm for a colleague. Same stack, same disagreements. How often do you actually budge? Much less often, as it turns out.</p><p>This isn’t hypothetical hand-wringing. <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-02077-2"">Recent research</a> involving 1,401 participants found that <strong>when people disagree with AI, they change their minds 32% of the time. With other humans, that figure drops to 11%.</strong> That’s almost three times more influence from a machine than from another person. Quite something, given we’ve spent millennia learning to be sceptical of each other.</p><p>We like to think of ourselves as rational decision-makers who simply use these tools as helpful aids. The evidence tells a different story. They do more than support our thinking; they reshape it. And far more powerfully than human opinions ever could.</p><p>This raises a question that should keep designers up at night: if users are this susceptible to algorithmic persuasion, what happens when the model itself is biased?</p><p>The answer isn’t just that users make biased choices. The effect compounds. Through repeated interactions, small errors snowball into meaningful distortions. And in most cases, users never notice it happening.</p><figure><img alt=""An infographic showing two stacks of CVs: a tall stack labelled “AI Recommended” and a shorter stack labelled “Your Gut Feeling.” An arrow shows 32% of decisions shifting toward the AI pile.

The problem isn’t one-sided. It’s a two-way street, with both the AI and the human feeding into a loop that amplifies bias at every turn.</p><p>On the AI side, these systems don’t simply reflect the patterns in their training data. They tend to exaggerate them. Machine learning models are optimised to detect and reinforce patterns, which means subtle skews in the data often become stronger in the output.</p><p>A hiring algorithm trained on historical data where 70% of successful hires were men doesn’t just reproduce that 70/30 split. It learns to weight male candidates more heavily, nudging the bias further along. The system is simply doing what it was built to do: find patterns and double down on them.</p><p>But that’s only half of the picture.</p><h3>The human half of the equation</h3><p>We don’t treat AI recommendations the same way we treat advice from another person. We tend to see automated systems as more objective, more analytical. Somehow immune to the messy biases that plague human thinking. This perception gets reinforced by how AI is marketed (“trained on the sum of human knowledge”) and by our long-standing trust in technology for high-stakes decisions in healthcare and finance.</p><p><a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-02077-2"">Research from University College London and MIT</a> shows just how potent this combination can be. Across a series of experiments, participants interpreted facial expressions, motion perception, and other people’s performance. In each case, they interacted with AI systems that had been deliberately programmed with biases similar to those found in many real-world models.</p><p><strong>What happened next wasn’t just a momentary nudge.</strong> The distortion deepened. Through repeated interaction, small initial errors grew into significant skews. Participants who started with relatively minor biases ended up with significantly stronger ones. Largely because the AI amplified existing patterns while participants remained unusually receptive to its guidance.</p><p>Here’s where it gets uncomfortable: most participants had no idea how much the AI was shaping their judgement. When researchers told participants they were interacting with another person (while secretly using a machine), the effect weakened. Simply believing the source was human reduced how deeply the bias took hold.</p><figure><img alt=""Three-phase diagram showing bias persistence. Phase 1: Human and AI robot making decisions together, producing a skewed pattern of outputs. Phase 2: AI is removed, human continues working alone. Phase 3: Human alone still making the same skewed decisions, with a “bias stuck” label and a broken gear icon indicating the pattern has transferred to the human even without the AI present."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*I7183KuMBJ1-HEdXNNmGnQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p>Awareness mattered, but not in the way we might expect. Knowing that the advice came from an algorithm made people <em>more</em> susceptible, not less. <strong>We expect AI to be right, so we lower our guard.</strong> It’s the automation equivalent of assuming the smoke alarm would have gone off if there were a real fire.</p><p>Even more troubling: this effect doesn’t vanish when the AI does. <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-42384-8"">A 2023 study</a> had participants assess medical images (specifically, deciding whether skin spots were benign or potentially cancerous) using a deliberately biased algorithm.</p><p>When the system was removed, the bias stuck around. People continued making the same skewed calls on their own, having unconsciously absorbed its patterns into their decision-making. The higher someone’s self-reported trust in automation, the more their independent conclusions mimicked the machine’s errors.</p><h3>The path of least resistance</h3><p>Our vulnerability to AI isn’t just about trust in technology. It’s rooted in something rather unflattering about how our brains handle effort.</p><p><strong>Psychologists call this the <em>cognitive miser</em> effect. </strong>Thinking is expensive (metabolically, emotionally, and in terms of time) so when we’re handed an opportunity to reduce mental effort, we tend to grab it. These systems offer a particularly seductive shortcut: offloading complex judgement to something that appears faster, smarter, and more thorough than we could manage ourselves.</p><p>This helps explain why automation bias shows up so consistently. <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3240751/"">Studies show</a> that when people work with automated decision-support systems, they dial back their own monitoring and verification. <strong>The presence of AI doesn’t just influence decisions; it quietly changes how much effort we put into thinking at all.</strong></p><p>We see the recommendation, and it feels complete. The work appears to be done. On to the next thing.</p><figure><img alt=""Split illustration comparing cognitive load.

We also tend to believe that these tools have analytical abilities that surpass our own. In some domains, that belief is justified. They can crunch enormous datasets, spot patterns at scale, and perform calculations far beyond human capability.</p><p>The problem is that we extend this assumption into contexts where it doesn’t hold.</p><p>The fact that an algorithm can analyse thousands of medical images doesn’t mean its assessment about an individual patient is infallible. Just because a system can process every CV in a database doesn’t mean it grasps what makes a good hire in a specific team. The leap from “impressive at scale” to “trustworthy in specifics” is one we make far too readily.</p><h3>When trust spirals</h3><p><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3240751/"">The evidence on automation bias</a> shows that inexperience and low confidence amplify this effect. When people feel uncertain about their own abilities, or when they’re working under time pressure, they’re more likely to defer to the machine.</p><p>This creates a rather unhelpful loop. <strong>The more we rely on AI, the less we exercise our own judgement. The less confident we become, the more we rely on it.</strong> Keep that cycle spinning long enough, and your decision-making instincts start to gather dust.</p><p>Branding matters too. Studies have found that when users are told they’re working with an “expert system” rather than a basic algorithm, they’re more likely to follow its recommendations — even when those recommendations are wrong. How we label AI directly shapes how much trust users place in it.</p><p>There’s also what researchers call <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation_bias"">“learned carelessness”</a>. When these systems perform well over time, users gradually reduce their vigilance. High reliability leads to complacency. If the system has been right 95% of the time, we stop checking as carefully. And when it stumbles on that remaining 5%, we’re rarely prepared.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram of a downward spiral with four stages: “Defer to AI” at the top, followed by “Practice Own Judgement Less”, then “Confidence in Own Ability Drops”, and finally “Defer to AI Even More.” The spiral tightens and darkens as it descends into a vortex."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dUJ8BO0UjkYFStYuUgdqOA.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><h3>More than the sum of its parts</h3><p>For a long time, AI bias and human bias have been treated as separate problems with separate fixes. We try to clean up training data and fine-tune models. We train users to recognise their own blind spots and think more critically. Both approaches matter, but they miss something essential. What emerges from human–AI interaction isn’t simply one plus the other. It’s compound bias. Something new that arises specifically from the interplay between the two.</p><p>Think of it less like an equation and more like a chemical reaction. When certain elements combine, they don’t just sit alongside one another. They interact, producing something neither had before they met.</p><p><a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2504.18759v1"">A recent paper</a> makes exactly this argument. <strong>Bias doesn’t live solely in the model or in the user. It emerges dynamically through feedback loops that evolve over time, each party making the other a little worse with every exchange.</strong></p><p>Medical AI studies illustrate this clearly. In a <a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2511.14591v2"">2025 study</a>, researchers examined what happens when class imbalance in AI systems meets human base rate neglect.</p><p>Class imbalance is a technical bias where rare conditions are underrepresented in training data. Base rate neglect is a human cognitive bias where we struggle to reason accurately about low-probability events. Individually, each causes predictable problems.</p><p>Together, they produce something worse.</p><p><strong>Class imbalance throws off people’s ability to gauge how much they should trust the AI. Base rate neglect makes users more vulnerable to skewed outputs.</strong> Each bias reinforces the other, creating feedback loops that lead to poorer outcomes than either would cause alone.</p><p>The errors don’t add up. They multiply.</p><h3>Fixing the wrong problem</h3><p>This is why traditional debiasing strategies often fall short. You can scrub training data and tune algorithms all you like. But if the interaction pattern itself amplifies bias, you haven’t solved the problem. You’ve just trimmed one input to a system that compounds errors regardless.</p><p>The same goes for human-focused interventions. <strong>Teaching users about cognitive bias is valuable, but if the interface encourages offloading and discourages verification, that knowledge stays theoretical.</strong> Filed under “good to know” and rarely retrieved.</p><p>The question shifts. It’s not “is the AI biased?” Or even “are the users biased?” Instead, it goes: “does this interaction create bias amplification over time?”</p><p>That’s a fundamentally different design challenge.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WTzPaQG-Fs7yjFKMekYRLg.png"" /><figcaption>Image based on Caravaggio’s Narcissus (1597–1599)</figcaption></figure><h3>Mirror, mirror in the interface</h3><p>AI doesn’t just mirror our biases. It amplifies them. Quietly, incrementally, and often invisibly. The problem isn’t confined to training data or human psychology alone. It lives in the space between humans and machines, shaped by how each influences the other over repeated interaction.</p><p>For designers, this reframes what we’re solving for. We can’t simply debias algorithms and dust off our hands. We can’t rely solely on user education. <strong>The bias emerges from the interaction itself. From patterns of trust, deference, and cognitive offloading that compound with every exchange.</strong></p><p>Which brings us to the real question.</p><p>If this amplification happens through everyday interactions with AI, where is it already showing up most strongly in the products we use today?</p><p>The research points to a particular type of interface. One that feels natural, helpful, and conversational. In these interactions, users don’t just follow biased recommendations. They begin to internalise them, carrying those biases forward even after the interaction ends.</p><p>And that’s precisely what makes it so hard to see.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Thanks for reading! 📖</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote><em>If you liked this post, </em><a href=""https://medium.com/@doracee""><em>follow me on Medium</em></a><em> for more.</em></blockquote><h3>References &amp; Credits</h3><p>Glickman, M., &amp; Sharot, T.

<p>Exploring navigation as something bigger than moving through physical and digital spaces — as a fundamental cognitive act</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*X6jNJk6M9uS348ftxZqXGQ.png"" /><figcaption>Shipping the package that’s yourself (Image generated using Procreate and Nanobanana)</figcaption></figure><p>A few weeks ago, I read an article — <a href=""https://www.doc.cc/articles/ai-navigation"">A new navigation paradigm</a> — that felt relatable, yet unsettling in a way I couldn’t fully articulate. I eventually stopped thinking about it, but the ideas lingered in the background. They then surfaced in the most mundane and seemingly unrelated places.</p><p>A few weeks later, as I struggled to submit a loan application online, I realized that my frustration stemmed from more than a technical problem. I had lost the ability to <em>navigate </em>the system.</p><p>Shortly after, while taking an Uber ride to a friend’s place, I caught myself in a moment of reflection. I was moving in the physical space with no attention to my surroundings, completely at the mercy of the driver, who was in turn following the instructions from his phone.</p><p>The kind of navigation I was doing in an Uber didn’t seem all that different from my attempts to navigate the banking system. Navigation suddenly felt bigger — like a fundamental cognitive act.</p><p>In this essay, I examine <strong>navigation in four different realms: institutional, physical, digital, and semantic</strong>. By exploring the commonalities, I hope to convey what’s at stake when we eliminate the <em>friction</em> of navigation, and how to deliberately regain some of it.</p><h3>Navigating the system</h3><p>I am currently attempting to fund a home loan through a major Indian bank that is committed to the idea of a “digital-first” India. As a sign of this commitment, they are now “digital-only” — they now process home loan applications online exclusively, or so I’m told. But the portal is a never-ending obstacle course, almost as if designed to test the user’s patience and persistence. It succeeds phenomenally.</p><p>I’m prompted for identification proofs as PDFs under 1MB or JPEGs under 5MB, but when I provide them, I get an error: <em>“Oops! Something went wrong.”</em> Of course, many things could go wrong. Underneath the digital interfaces is the cross-continent network that makes them all tick — the hundreds of hardware devices the data has to traverse, the tens of thousands of miles of wire crossing land and oceans. Distributed systems are built assuming ephemeral failures. But when they happen consistently, it signals something systemic.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*caGp-0y1osvEHv4av2lxqg.png"" /><figcaption>“Oops! Something went wrong.” Error while submitting documents on a banking portal</figcaption></figure><p>You know the problem is prevalent when it becomes material for comedy. Biswas Kalyan Rath, an Indian stand-up comedian, <a href=""https://youtu.be/PK_zuAuI9x0?si=szB908spPScog_k6&amp;t=64"">has a good bit about the state of “digital-first” marriage registration in India</a>.</p><blockquote>“Marriage, no problem. Very simple. Getting marriage registered.. Big problem. It was always a problem, now there is the illusion of Digital India. There is a website. You can go and register. No problem. Fill the entire form. The “Submit” button does not work.”</blockquote><p>I cracked up when I watched it. I’m not laughing now. I’m three weeks into the loan application, and I need it approved.</p><p>The deeper problem isn’t the bad website. It’s what it does to its users. I understand technology, but the bank’s application is a black box to me. The loan agent is an expert in the process but has proven useless. He’s as much a spectator in this as I am. I’m not merely dependent on the website; I’m trapped between technology that’s not done well and a human who doesn’t understand it well. We’ve both lost the ability to <em>navigate</em> the system.</p><h3>Navigating the physical world</h3><p>During my childhood, when I traveled by bus to my maternal hometown — Ichalkaranji, Maharashtra’s textile hub — we could tell we had arrived by the pungent smell and rhythmic din of the cotton mills. We could tell the time remaining by the landmarks we passed — the restaurants, the trees, the market, the temples, the stadium. Knowing a destination meant knowing its spatial signature. We had to read the surroundings to know when we had arrived. Navigation was an act of observation. Even the act of describing a destination meant being deeply aware of its characteristics. We saw a place as a point in space, situated relative to other places.</p><p>Then came paper maps, which provided a way to abstract the physical reality and capture its essence in symbols. It was a leap forward, but still required us to compare the map against the territory — active interpretation. The map acted as external memory. The processing still happened in your brain. In software terms, this was the separation of storage and compute. The maps only told you the layout. You had to orient yourself against it.</p><p>Then Google Maps outsourced “compute” too.</p><p>It wasn’t just paper maps on a screen. It offered a fundamentally different technology: <em>active navigation</em>. Active interpretation on the user’s part gave way to the step-by-step guidance from the software. It not only knew the landscape; it knew your place in it. You just had to trust it. Spatial navigation became a skill you no longer needed. When Google Maps tells me to “take the next exit and stay on the second to the right lane”, I mindlessly execute.</p><p>What navigation demands from me now is not intelligence but compliance.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2hg4yjIZHevidm3IrPtAhw.png"" /><figcaption>Navigating by compliance (Image generated using Procreate and Nanobanana)</figcaption></figure><p>I’m as much a victim as a culprit of this de-skilling that has happened at scale. Due to my overreliance on technology, I don’t remember the street names in my neighborhood anymore, despite having lived in the same place for over two years. It speaks to how little I pay attention to the world around me when the blue arrow and the friendly voice are leading the way.</p><p><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7156656/"">A 2020 longitudinal study</a> tracked regular drivers over three years and found that people with greater lifetime GPS experience demonstrated reduced spatial memory during self-guided navigation. It found not just correlation, but causality of GPS use leading to decline in spatial memory.</p><h3>Getting carried away</h3><p>Compare this to the Uber model.</p><p>You set the destination, a driver accepts, you accept, and off you go. One of the “benefits” of Uber is that it relieves you of the mundane act of driving. Your attentional resources, the logic goes, can be better spent on “more important” needs — like scrolling social media on your phone instead of greeting the human three feet away. Thanks to self-driving cars, we’ve even eliminated that guilt, if there ever was.</p><p>Somewhere in that scroll, you lose track of time, of the route, of your environment. You’re physically there, but mentally elsewhere. The only active role you’ve played is scheduling the pick-up and the drop-off. You’ve shipped the package that is yourself.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*k0y481sV4ABUh7-lWm-1RA.png"" /><figcaption>Uber pickup and drop-off</figcaption></figure><h3>Navigating the digital world</h3><p>Consider a typical day using digital interfaces. You log in to your computer or your phone, you find the application you need, navigate through its menus and screens, do what you want to do, close it, move on to the next app. It’s essentially an endless loop of navigation until you log off and go back to the real world.</p><p>This is akin to navigation in the pre-GPS world. There is a certain map of the world — the software’s user interface — and you have to learn it. You “onboard” yourself, and navigate it by paying attention. You are spatially aware of the world that the software has created for you. You know what capabilities it has, or where and how to find them.</p><p>We are increasingly moving towards an intent-based navigation system, or as I think of it, “Uber-ification” of the digital world. Intent-based software comes in two flavors: search-first, and AI-first.</p><p>In search-first applications, you search for keywords, say, “expense report” and it’ll show you potential actions like “View your expense reports” or “File a new expense report”. You select the one you want without knowing where it lives in the application. The geography doesn’t matter.</p><p>In AI-first applications, it’s even more extreme. You declare the intent — “File my expenses” — and the agent handles the rest. You’ve achieved your goal without ever knowing where the expense module is housed in the software, or even how to even file one yourself.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/727/1*Z3AwXnIZWn1Ceh_Qq9795Q.png"" /><figcaption>Intent-driven: Search-first</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/743/1*0Z9bFsL-7NjcpvzCWKIg1Q.png"" /><figcaption>Intent-driven: AI-first</figcaption></figure><p>There’s a plethora of intent-based software now, with AI embedded in them, eager to translate your intent into outcomes. Traditional navigation is gradually converging into a ubiquitous conversational interface.</p><p>Notion AI promises to write your docs for you. Cursor and Claude promise to write your code. Glean <a href=""https://outofdesk.blog/blog/performance-reviews-llms"">writes your performance reviews</a> — the very document that requires sitting with the uncomfortable and hard work of assessing your own year, your team’s contributions, their strengths and weaknesses in your own words.

No reflection required</figcaption></figure><p>Each of these <em>smart</em> apps makes you more productive. No navigation required. No blank page to face. No empty file with a cursor blinking. Information architecture — the design of where things live and how they connect — no longer matters. Not to you, at least. The agent navigates for you.</p><h3>Beyond movement: Navigation as a metacognitive skill</h3><p>Consider what happens when you navigate without GPS in an unfamiliar city. You <strong>assess</strong> your current location, <strong>identify</strong> your destination, <strong>survey</strong> available information — landmarks, street signs, smell, sounds, <strong>hypothesize</strong> about which direction to go, <strong>make decisions</strong> with incomplete information, <strong>monitor</strong> feedback as you move, <strong>adjust</strong>, when you encounter obstacles, wrong turns, or dead ends, and <strong>learn</strong> from the experience, building a richer understanding of the territory.</p><p>Now consider what you do when you’re trying to understand a topic, say, climate change. You <strong>assess</strong> what you currently know or understand, <strong>identify</strong> what you need to know, <strong>survey</strong> available information — documentation, courses, articles, real world case-studies, papers, mental models, <strong>hypothesize</strong> about how it might work, <strong>make decisions</strong> about which path to explore first with incomplete information, <strong>monitor</strong> feedback as you learn, <strong>adjust</strong> your mental model when you hit obstacles, and <strong>learn</strong>, building a richer, more accurate understanding of the system.</p><p>Problem-solving is navigation. Learning is navigation. Decision-making is navigation. You’re moving through space — either real or conceptual — through uncertainty, towards clarity, understanding, destination, or outcomes.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*d711JP8zbOaFo9j4j8lQUQ.png"" /><figcaption>Navigating to clarity (Image generated using Procreate and Nanobanana)</figcaption></figure><p>This isn’t a metaphor. <a href=""https://iiif.library.cmu.edu/file/Simon_box00065_fld05031_bdl0001_doc0001/Simon_box00065_fld05031_bdl0001_doc0001.pdf"">Herbert Simon’s work</a> describes problem-solving as “search through a problem-space.” <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5248972/"">Neuroscience has also shown that the same neural systems(the hippocampus, place, and grid cells)</a> support both physical and conceptual navigation. What makes something navigation isn’t whether it moves through a physical space, but rather that it requires relational mapping, position assessment, route planning, and dynamic reorganization.</p><p>So we are navigating pretty much all the time. And it’s becoming easier with technology. So what?</p><p>Just as GPS use causes a measurable decline in our spatial memory, AI tools that navigate conceptual spaces for us pose the same risk in a different, arguably more critical, domain.</p><h3>The Pharmakon and the problem with frictionless</h3><p>Looking at technological innovations through the lens of <a href=""https://aeon.co/essays/bernard-stieglers-philosophy-on-how-technology-shapes-our-world""><em>pharmakon</em></a> — both remedy and poison — remedies are clearly visible: speed, efficiency, productivity, convenience. Even when they’re not, organizations are happy to sell us on them.</p><p>The poisons are more subtle: dependency, agency, losing the cognitive friction that maintains our capacity to navigate. The agent absorbs the cost of navigation, but it also becomes the locus of agency.</p><p>Two risks that stand out, and are worth thinking about:</p><p><strong>The transfer of agency</strong>: By shifting the agency of navigation to the software, you end up being at the mercy of the navigator. <a href=""https://outofdesk.blog/performance-reviews-llms"">If the AI routes you, you stop thinking about alternatives.</a> The convenience is paid for with a little bit of your money and a lot more of your agency. With the erasure of navigation, Information Architecture gives way to Choice Architecture.</p><p>This might be fine for filing tax returns. Humanity would benefit from spending less time doing that. But what happens when the same happens with critical thinking? Comprehension? Reflection? Decision-making?</p><p><strong>The vacuum of attention</strong>: With the time and attention you’ve regained from not navigating, you need something meaningful to do. Few people know what to do with that kind of freedom. They look to technology to fill the void. But the incentives of technology companies, more often than not, don’t align with the well-being of the user, especially when the way to make money and user interests are at odds.</p><p>When you’re not navigating and also not driving, there’s the promise of reflecting, reading, thinking, writing, or building. But first, why not catch up on what your friends are doing? Or the Kardashians? Or millions of strangers?</p><p>It presents a dark irony: We save time by delegating things to technology, only to pour that time back into it, mindlessly scrolling.</p><h3>Solutions: For victims and culprits</h3><p>I want to think about solutions to this problem, both as a victim — a consumer and a <em>navigator</em> — and a culprit — someone who builds technology products, and <em>designs </em>navigation.</p><p>I say culprits not because they have bad intentions, but likely because they either lack any or they are acting on misaligned incentives.</p><h3>Micro-frictions as the antidote for the victim</h3><p>I’m learning to be more intentional about what friction I want to eliminate and what I want to preserve. About what navigation I want to do myself versus delegate.</p><p>I use AI every day. It has largely empowered me. But I’m deliberate in its use.</p><p>I resist the temptation to start with AI-generated drafts because the value of writing lies in the struggle to articulate the original thought. It’s that struggle that clarifies what you want to say, what you want to achieve. Only then do I use AI. My process isn’t simply sequential, so the handoff isn’t a clear line. It’s a feedback loop. But the bulk of my effort goes into the pre-AI phase, ensuring that I build a vision for the artifact that I want to produce — whether it’s an essay or software. I can then direct it rather than being led by it.</p><p>For places I visit regularly, I’ve stopped using maps. I’m rebuilding the habit of paying attention to my surroundings.</p><p>I keep my phone away when I’m with my kids, both to be present with them and implicitly teach them the value of paying attention. I find pockets of time severed from technology — sipping coffee, going on walks — which builds the habit of being comfortable alone with my thoughts.</p><p>How is this all related to navigation, you say? Intentionality brings clarity, which in turn helps you navigate effectively.</p><p>If you want to read more about this idea of introducing friction, this article from The Cut captures it well: <a href=""https://www.thecut.com/article/brooding-friction-maxxing-new-years-2026-resolution.html""><em>In 2026, We Are Friction-Maxxing</em></a>.</p><h3>Design principles for technologists as culprits</h3><p>This might sound obvious, but when designing technology products, it helps to keep users’ needs <em>and well-being</em> in mind.</p><p><strong>Build robust fallback mechanisms:</strong> In the banking portal, when the “digital-only” system failed, neither the customer nor the employee could navigate an alternative path. The system had eliminated all other routes.</p><p>Before implementing AI assistance or intent-based shortcuts, think about whether the user can complete the task if the feature breaks or is unavailable. Build fallback mechanisms that allow manual navigation when automated paths fail, surface error states that help users understand what went wrong, provide enough context for users to troubleshoot independently, and maintain alternative paths to the same destination.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tGOrUoGbx8Q4_Dqgx6_wrw.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/9356221-deploy-fin-ai-agent-over-email"">Fin agent fallback</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Distinguish between transactional and developmental tasks:</strong> When developing automations, distinguish between <strong>transactional tasks</strong> (filing taxes, scheduling meetings, data entry) and <strong>developmental tasks</strong> (writing, learning, problem-solving, decision-making). This is similar to the idea of distinguishing between <a href=""https://outofdesk.blog/thinking-outside-the-doc"">competitive artifacts and complementary artifacts</a>.</p><p>Transactional tasks should be frictionless. These are tasks where efficiency is the primary goal, and there’s little value in the process itself. But developmental tasks benefit from <a href=""https://every.to/thesis/in-the-ai-age-making-things-difficult-is-deliberate"">good friction</a>. The process of navigating uncertainty is often where the real value lies.</p><p><a href=""https://danielmiessler.com/blog/keep-the-robots-out-of-the-gym"">“Gym skills”</a> is a good metaphor. For developmental tasks, consider AI as a collaborator that augments rather than replaces the user’s cognitive work. <a href=""https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/blog/the-importance-of-friction-in-ai-systems/"">Speculative and Critical Design (SCD)</a> framework lays out one of the most articulate ways to think about this.</p><p><strong>Adjust assistance based on expertise:</strong> Design systems that adjust assistance levels based on user expertise, because effective delegation requires good judgment on the user’s part.</p><p>Beginners benefit from more guidance, explanations, and visible structure to help them build mental models of the system. Intermediate users can make effective use of shortcuts and intent-based features, but in a way that traditional navigation is visible and accessible. Expert users demand customizability, creating their own navigation paths, or even disabling assistance they don’t need.</p><p>The problem with many AI-first products is that they apply the same level of automation to everyone, preventing users from ever developing expertise. A newly minted manager using AI to completely delegate the work of crafting performance reviews for the team, for example, isn’t going to build the muscle of reflecting on the relationships with people, paying attention to their motivations, strengths, and weaknesses.</p><p><strong>Preserve visible structure:</strong> Even with search-first or AI-first interfaces, users benefit from understanding the underlying structure. Consider <strong>visual sitemaps or navigation breadcrumbs</strong> that show users where they are in the system, <strong>contextual hints</strong> about where information lives, even when delivering it through search, and <strong>progressive disclosure</strong> that reveals structure as users engage more deeply with the product.</p><p><a href=""https://www.aiuxdesign.guide/"">aiuxdesign.guide</a> has a comprehensive set of design patterns that mention some of these and more, with real-world examples.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>There are a few pockets of life that haven’t been taken over by assistive and active technology. Building the muscle to tolerate (and design) good friction and (help) reclaiming the ownership of your attention are good starts to prepare for what’s ahead. There’s little I can do to navigate the banking system. But there are other areas I can exercise control, both as a creator and a consumer.</p><p><em>Find me on </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ggauravr/""><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em>, </em><a href=""https://x.com/outofdesk""><em>X</em></a><em>, or check out my </em><a href=""https://outofdesk.blog/""><em>blog here</em></a><em>.</em></p><h3>Inspirations and references</h3><ul><li><a href=""https://www.doc.cc/articles/ai-navigation"">DOC • A new navigation paradigm</a></li><li><a href=""https://signalpath.substack.com/p/do-ai-products-even-need-navigation"">Do AI Products Even Need Navigation? — by Andrew Sims</a></li><li><a href=""https://aeon.co/essays/bernard-stieglers-philosophy-on-how-technology-shapes-our-world"">Bernard Stiegler’s philosophy on how technology shapes our world | Aeon Essays</a></li><li><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7156656/"">Habitual use of GPS negatively impacts spatial memory during self-guided navigation — PMC</a></li><li><a href=""https://youtu.be/PK_zuAuI9x0?si=szB908spPScog_k6&amp;t=64"">Biswa Kalyan Rath | Birth Proof | Stand Up Comedy</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.thecut.com/article/brooding-friction-maxxing-new-years-2026-resolution.html"">In 2026, We Are Friction-Maxxing</a></li><li><a href=""https://iiif.library.cmu.edu/file/Simon_box00065_fld05031_bdl0001_doc0001/Simon_box00065_fld05031_bdl0001_doc0001.pdf"">THE THEORY OF PROBLEM SOLVING</a></li><li><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5248972/"">Organizing Conceptual Knowledge in Humans with a Grid-like Code — PMC</a></li><li><a href=""https://asana.com/ai-principles"">Asana — Our principles for helping humanity thrive with AI</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.psychoftech.org/blog/2020/3/10/cognitive-artifacts"">Cognitive Artifacts — Psychology of Technology Institute</a></li><li><a href=""https://every.to/thesis/in-the-ai-age-making-things-difficult-is-deliberate"">In the AI Age, Making Things Difficult Is Deliberate | Every</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.notion.com/blog/the-design-thinking-behind-notion-ai"">The Thinking Behind Notion AI</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/blog/the-importance-of-friction-in-ai-systems/"">The Importance of Fricton in AI Systems | Mozilla Foundation</a></li><li><a href=""https://hbr.org/2022/06/why-ai-customer-journeys-need-more-friction"">Why AI Customer Journeys Need More Friction | HBR</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.aiuxdesign.guide/"">AI UX Design Patterns</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=f6c63585f7af"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/getting-carried-away-when-intelligence-is-replaced-by-compliance-f6c63585f7af"">Getting carried away: When intelligence is replaced by compliance</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4><em>How product teams should evaluate AI-generated UI</em></h4><p>AI app-building tools have made it inconsequential and mundane to turn an idea into a working prototype. You only need a couple prompts, a design file, or even a sketch to quickly generate something that looks (even behaves) like a real product. For product teams, this speed has changed expectations in the design and development process.</p><p>Prototypes are no longer as special as they once were. They’re now the bare minimum.</p><p>But this speed comes with limitations. Many AI-generated prototypes are never meant to survive past the moment they’re validated. They do their job in a meeting or a user test, but then they’re rebuilt by engineering or even trashed. But the prototypes didn’t “fail,” they were just created with a different intention and outcome.</p><p>The hidden cost of AI prototypes is that they can’t move forward. And when the underlying output is treated as “disposable” automatically, product teams pay for it later in the product lifecycle through translation work, rewrites, and reduced speed.</p><figure><img alt=""Creating AI-prototypes in Anima and Replit tools"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tQwxealvhwQ05oy5oeR0CQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>AI tools have changed the design-dev workflow; can prototypes thrive through product stages?</em></figcaption></figure><p>It’s no question that AI has become part of everyday product development. But it’s no longer just how fast we can generate UI, it’s more about what kind of output we are creating. We need to think past prototypes that can be used for a 30 minute stakeholder review, such as thinking about what happens after the ideation stage ends.</p><p>Some tools are optimized for ideation and to quickly answer questions. But others are beginning to treat AI output as the first draft of real product work. Let’s get into understanding how AI prototypes can survive the product lifecycle, tools that are better for different prototype use cases, and criteria to help product teams choose the right prototype for their needs.</p><h3>What it means for an AI prototype to “survive”</h3><p>Most product teams don’t struggle to generate UI anymore. But they do have a challenge in deciding whether what they’ve generated is something they can both keep and use.</p><h4>It’s more than visual polish</h4><p>AI-generated prototypes can look visually polished and even behave as intended, but it still may not survive past the ideation phase. We need to think about what the prototype allows a product team to do after ideation.</p><p>Some questions to ask when deciding if your prototype will survive past ideation:</p><ul><li>Can the prototype be extended without starting over?</li><li>Can it be handed off without being reinterpreted?</li><li>Can it live outside the AI tool that created it?</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Design visuals and code output produced by Framer, but is limited to the tool itself"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oZwkGkR7NdhBq_lFLRSHnw.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.framer.com/""><em>Framer</em></a><em> automatically produces code for the visuals generated, but can it live outside Framer?</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you begin to think about the extensibility of your prototype too late (like after it’s been validated), you might quickly reach a dead end. Though the UI looks high-quality and finished, it deceives what’s lying under the hood in the actual output.</p><p>Not only that, many AI-generated prototypes are abstract. They render well in the tool that created them, but the underlying structure is hazy or even constricted to the AI tool. These prototypes do help answer early questions, like “Does this flow make sense?,” but they’re difficult to carry forward without translation or rework.</p><h4>Proper structure outlasts visuals</h4><p>Durable prototypes are built from real frontend formatting, like structured markup, predictable layout, and clear component usage. This structure makes the prototype legible to engineers, collaborators, and the AI tools themselves.</p><p>When the prototype’s output is inspectable and portable to other tools, it can be understood and evolved.</p><figure><img alt=""Code output from Anima App that prioritizes production-readiness and portability"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wt9uB0MxkXLJ4PUX2_f0_w.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://dev.animaapp.com/""><em>Anima App</em></a><em> generates designs and code intended to be used outside the tool</em></figcaption></figure><p>AI tools can only amplify the inputs and outputs you continue to build from. Abstract AI output compounds into rework with teams regenerating or rebuilding what already exists. But clean, structured output encourages faster iteration and usable output because each change builds on the last.</p><p>An AI prototype’s “lifespan” reflects what the tool was optimized to create. Understanding the distinction between a disposable or durable helps teams choose tools that match what they intend to build.</p><h3>How AI app-building tools optimize for different lifespans</h3><p>Once you start looking at AI-generated prototypes in terms of their lifespan, you’ll notice patterns across popular AI tools available to product teams. You’re probably assuming that AI app-building tools are all trying to do the same thing, like producing high-quality designs and code.</p><p>But these AI tools are actually optimized for different stages in the product lifecycle. Most fall under three main buckets: full-stack generators, visual builders, or design-native generators. Let’s look at familiar tools found in each bucket.</p><h4>Full-stack AI generators</h4><p>Full-stack generators like Bolt, Lovable, and Replit are designed to produce end-to-end applications quickly. They can handle the generated app’s infrastructure, hosting, and behavior for multiple user flows. These tools are powerful when experimenting or needing quick product deployments.</p><figure><img alt=""Full-stack AI tools like Replit create rapid prototypes for desktop and mobile"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RBqDSAceLsOOOPUDy3qTqg.png"" /><figcaption><em>AI tools like </em><a href=""https://replit.com/products/design""><em>Replit</em></a><em> are ideal for small product teams with rapid timelines</em></figcaption></figure><p>Benefits:</p><ul><li>Extremely fast method to go from idea to working application</li><li>Low setup needed for end-to-end generation</li><li>Allows quick validation for solo or small teams</li></ul><p>Limitations:</p><ul><li>Code output is typically bound to the tool that generated it</li><li>Code structure prioritizes quick execution over long-term durability</li><li>Harder integrate the frontend work into existing codebases</li><li>Less flexibility when engineers need more control</li></ul><h4>Visual building tools</h4><p>Visual builders such as Webflow and Framer are ideal for creating polished experiences that live within the platform itself. They’re well-suited for marketing sites or even personal websites where the tool itself is part of the delivery method. Since the AI tool is also the production environment, handoff of frontend code to engineering is secondary or unnecessary.</p><figure><img alt=""Visual builders like Framer produce responsive and visual UI, but are constrained to the tool itself"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3ckByB8Nntl2Mvs1kD7TMw.png"" /><figcaption><em>Visual builders like </em><a href=""https://www.framer.com/""><em>Framer</em></a><em> produce responsive and visual UI, but are constrained to the tool</em></figcaption></figure><p>Benefits:</p><ul><li>High-fidelity, production-quality visual output</li><li>Supports publishing, hosting, and content management workflows</li><li>Designers can own and ship real experiences</li><li>Reliable for marketing and personal websites</li></ul><p>Limitations:</p><ul><li>Exported code is not intended for strategic evolution</li><li>Included logic in the frontend is dependent on the platform</li><li>Restricts deep engineering customization and may need rework</li></ul><h4>Design-native generators</h4><p>Design-native generation tools, like Figma Make, are ideal for high-speed exploration. They help teams iterate on structure, layout, and user flow directly inside the design tool. The output is effective as a reference when reviewing and testing, but it’s not intended to be integrated in a production codebase.</p><figure><img alt=""Figma Make is integrated within the design tool, but it’s focused more on visual output versus code"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Igk5W5dDfw6FN99LpI2JSQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1IssNgKM28""><em>Figma Make</em></a><em> is integrated within the design tool, but the output focuses on visual vs. code output</em></figcaption></figure><p>Benefits:</p><ul><li>Fast iteration inside existing design-product workflows</li><li>Smooth exploration for UI layouts and user flows</li><li>Effective for early validation and team collaboration</li></ul><p>Limitations:</p><ul><li>Output is a reference versus a code foundation</li><li>Engineers may need to rebuild rather than extend the frontend code</li><li>Optimized for exploration, but not product maturation</li></ul><p>None of these tool approaches are inherently better or worse, but teams need to understand what each tool is optimized to do. Whether it be to answer questions early in the ideation phase or to publish product experience. They just reflect different assumptions about what happens after a prototype proves its point.</p><h3>Designing AI-generated prototypes to continue past ideation</h3><p>Most AI-generated prototypes were created to answer questions or validate a direction while in the ideation phase. They weren’t produced to become part of the actual product.</p><p>But instead of asking, “How fast can we generate this?,” teams need to start asking, “What happens if this works?” That shift changes what kind of output matters and the right tool to use.</p><p>To help with this shift, teams need to generate prototypes that are made from the same fundamentals as production. This includes real HTML elements, predictable layout, and clear UI components to make the output understandable to engineers and other tools.</p><h4>AI accelerates continuity or disposability</h4><p>This is where the output’s effects on AI are unavoidable. Because each AI-generation builds on what already exists, unstructured output compounds issues–causing regenerating or rebuilding the same ideas again and again.</p><p>So prototypes designed to continue get better as the AI-generations evolve, while prototypes designed to be temporary get replaced.</p><figure><img alt=""Anima generates prototypes starting from Figma designs, live websites, or brand inspiration"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Tl2SNCCCw0yqtdTvE_npRw.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://dev.animaapp.com/""><em>Anima</em></a><em> can generate prototypes starting from Figma designs or live websites</em></figcaption></figure><h4>Tools that create durable AI prototypes</h4><p>Real products progress from existing interfaces/ patterns or partial designs; not from blank prompts. Tools that support starting from design files, live URLs, or existing UI allow teams to preserve context instead of recreating it within a prompt.</p><p>AI tools like Anima approach producing prototypes this way. The tool focuses on creating structured, real frontend code that can be handed off to development versus showing a high-quality render of UI designs.</p><figure><img alt=""Anima creates both high-fidelity visuals and code ready to be exported outside the tool"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uDzBp4JfFjnUDNhD-uiUkg.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://dev.animaapp.com/""><em>Anima</em></a><em> creates both high-fidelity visuals and code ready to be exported outside the tool</em></figcaption></figure><p>Anima’s prototypes include added value not only from their usability from the get-go, but by reducing translation work once engineers begin to review the code output.</p><p>Designing AI prototypes doesn’t mean every prototype has to be production-ready. It just means product teams can choose whether the work they’re creating is meant to be disposable or durable.</p><h3>How teams should decide what kind of prototype they’re building</h3><p>Before evaluating any AI app-building tool, product teams need to clarify a few questions to select relevant criteria to rate each tool against. This will allow teams to use tools more intentionally and avoid the disposal of work later in the design lifecycle.</p><p>Questions teams should ask themselves:</p><ul><li>What is this prototype meant to do? (i.e., validate an idea vs. create production work)</li><li>What happens after idea validation? (i.e., restart/ re-build vs. handoff to engineers)</li><li>Should code output be modified outside the AI tool? (or is it okay for output to be bound to the tool?)</li><li>Should the code and AI tool support long-term iteration? (or is the output only for one-off ideas?)</li></ul><p>If your team’s goals are to validate ideas quickly, disposable prototypes are a wanted tool outcome versus a flaw. But if the goal is to create prototypes that will evolve into production, you’ll need AI tools that support that.</p><figure><img alt=""The AI tool for your team depends on your workflow and the intended deliverables, like useful visuals or useful code"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UMQymkGoKbUlTF5NWrje0g.png"" /><figcaption><em>Selecting an AI tool for your team depends on your workflow and the intended deliverables</em></figcaption></figure><h4>Optimize for the prototype lifespan you need</h4><p>Different tools optimize for different lifespans; here is a key to help make quick decisions:</p><ul><li>Short-lived artifacts that answer questions quickly → Design-native generators</li><li>Platform-contained experiences that publish efficiently → Visual building tools</li><li>Structured outputs that can serve as production foundations → Full-stack AI generators</li></ul><p>Again, none of these tools are superior. The right choice just depends on how long the work is expected to “live” and who will own it from iteration to iteration.</p><p>When teams evaluate tools based on intention, like what they’ll be able to keep or build on, they shift their mindset from only speed alone to idea continuity.</p><p>AI has dramatically lowered the cost of starting in such a short time-span. Quickly generating interfaces, user flows, and functional apps is no longer the hard part. But now, it isn’t how quickly product teams can produce prototypes, it’s how much of that work they can carry forward.</p><p>The hidden cost of AI prototypes isn’t that they fail to deliver. It’s that many were never designed to. Product teams need to evaluate tools based on what they generate as well as what they help advance to move away from disposable prototypes to evolving beginnings.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=00cc4d491dec"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-hidden-cost-of-ai-prototypes-that-are-made-to-die-00cc4d491dec"">The hidden cost of AI prototypes that are made to die</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<p><em>Welcome to </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/money-diary"">Money Diaries</a><em> where we are tackling the ever-present taboo that is money. We’re asking real people how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period — and we’re tracking every last dollar.</em></p>



<p><em>If you’d like to submit your own Money Diary, you can do so via our <a href=""https://you.refinery29.com/submit-money-diary"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">online form</a>. We pay $150 for each published diary. Apologies but we’re not able to reply to every email.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Editor’s note: After a short hiatus, we’re back once a week! Thank you for your patience. We’ll be honoring Money Diary submissions we received during our break by publishing them in the coming weeks. There’s more to come soon — stay tuned.</em></strong><em> </em></p>



<p><em>This week: a marketing manager on $167,000 and who spends some of her money on some knitting yarn.</em></p>



<p><em>This Money Diary was written in the summer of 2025.</em> <em>This is a follow-up diary. You can read the original diary </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/marketing-manager-chicago-salary-money-diary""><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>



<p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Marketing manager<br /><strong>Industry:</strong> Life sciences<br /><strong>Age:</strong> 31<br /><strong>Location:</strong> Chicago, IL<br /><strong>Salary:</strong> $167,295 ($143,295 base + $24,000 bonus)<br /><strong>Joint Income/Financial Setup:</strong> Our joint income is around ~$240,000 (+/- $10k). My husband, F., is a freelance director of photography and has recently gone back to school to facilitate a career change to healthcare.  Shortly after my first <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/marketing-manager-chicago-salary-money-diary"">Money Diary</a> we made the decision to combine our finances. It was a little challenging at first, but at the end of the day, we are a team, and we make financial decisions together. Combining finances has given us a clear picture of where we stand as a family and has allowed us to meet big financial goals like completely paying off our student loans last year. The way we manage our finances is that we plan our monthly budget off of my net income, and all money F. brings in goes into our liquid savings account. At the end of every month, we review our spending and sort everything into a spreadsheet with categories to track our spending habits and make sure we’re staying on top of our financial goals.<br /><strong>Assets</strong> <br /><strong>Home value:</strong> $275,000 <br /><strong>Car value:</strong> $20,000<br /><strong>Combined retirement accounts &amp; investments:</strong> $250,848.52<br /><strong>Checking account:</strong> $1,785<br /><strong>Savings account:</strong> $66,612.60<br /><strong>Debt:</strong> $172,600 (home loan)<br /><strong>Paycheck Amount (2x/month):</strong> $3,252 (my husband’s varies)<br /><strong>Pronouns:</strong> She/her<br /><br /><strong>Monthly Expenses</strong><br /><strong>Housing Costs:</strong> $1,742.64 ($1,368 mortgage + $374 HOA). <br /><strong>Loan Payments:</strong> $0 (we paid off student loans last year)</p>



<p><strong>All Other Monthly Expenses</strong><br />Paycheck deductions (per paycheck):<br /><strong>Health/Life Insurance:</strong> $273<br /><strong>Investments:</strong> $1460<br /><br /><strong>Recurring expenses</strong> <br /><strong>Utilities:</strong> $100<br /><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> $70<br /><strong>Gym membership for two:</strong> $154<br /><strong>Car insurance:</strong> $111<br /><strong>Mint mobile (2x lines):</strong> $53<br /><strong>Dog medication:</strong> $55<br /><br /><strong>Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?</strong><br />There was an expectation to attend college and get my bachelor’s degree. However, I strayed away from getting a degree in anything that would require higher education because I was afraid of having to take on additional debt. I paid for undergrad with a combination of student loans, settlement money from a childhood injury, and some support from my parents. My husband F. is currently pursuing a career change with plans to go to med school. Seeing him in school definitely has me toying with going back and getting an MBA. My company has tuition reimbursement programs I’m looking into.<br /><br /><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?</strong><br />I did not receive a lot of education around money growing up. My parents made a handful of bad financial decisions and got into a lot of business debt owning their own small business. Tax-advantage accounts and employer 401(k)s were totally foreign to me when I first started working, but I think we’ve done a good job building an investment portfolio given our financial backgrounds. My husband and I have done a lot to improve our financial literacy as adults and discuss our finances often.<br /><br /><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?</strong><br />My first job out of college was working as a marketing coordinator at a PR agency. I got the job because I studied communications during college and snagged a paid internship between my junior and senior years. I worked as an intern until I graduated and was offered a full-time position. I was incredibly grateful to have a job lined up on day one of post-grad. My starting salary was $38k, which is wild to think about now! At the time, I was extremely careful with how I spent my money and even managed to save some on this salary.<br /><br /><strong>Did you worry about money growing up?</strong><br />Yes — looking back it is very clear to me that my parents were striving for a life that their careers could not afford. I grew up with a lot of insecurity around money, and feared that my peers would find out about my parents’ financial struggles and think less of me. Growing up this way definitely pushed me to strive for financial security and success as an adult.<br /><br /><strong>Do you worry about money now?</strong><br />No — I am very aware that we live a life that exceeded either of our expectations and feel confident in our current financial position and trajectory. Additionally, combining our accounts pushed me to take my emotions out of finances. I also know that I’m incredibly privileged to be able to think of money as a tool that allows us to live a comfortable life.<br /><br /><strong>At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?</strong><br />I became financially responsible for myself the day I graduated college. My husband and I have built a financial safety net for ourselves through paying off loans, liquid savings, purchasing property, and investing in retirement accounts. We’ve been able to do all of this by living within our means through our 20s, and by prioritizing spending on long-term investments. <br /><br /><strong>Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.</strong><br />Yes. This past year we received a $10k gift from my grandfather. His health has declined and he is living with my parents, and sold all of his properties. The grandchildren all received a financial gift from the property sales. </p>



<h3>Day One: Monday </h3>



<p>8:00 a.m. — The temps have dropped so we are finally sleeping with the windows open but it means we had a noisier-than-usual night and didn’t get great sleep. My husband, F., makes coffee while I browse white-noise machines. I notice that they are HSA/FSA eligible so make a note to come back for my purchase. </p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — I boot up my computer for the week and check in with co-workers before I get ready to take the dog, P., around the block. I listen to my audiobook, <em>Darling Girls</em>, while I walk P. around the block. I love listening to audiobooks and love that you get 10 hours of listening included in your monthly Spotify Premium subscription! </p>



<p>9:00 a.m. — I join my weekly round robin all-hands call as F. heads out for a job. My co-worker has the updates for my team this week so I just listen in while all teams give their updates and priorities for the week. </p>



<p>9:30 a.m. — Next meeting of the morning! I hop on a call with all the product marketers on my team and we discuss what we’re working on this week. For me, it’s a few housekeeping tasks and a little bit of planning for future projects. I just wrapped up managing a big project and my manager is on paternity leave for the next two weeks, so it’ll probably be a pretty slow week for me work-wise. </p>



<p>10:00 a.m. — It’s time for breakfast! I take a break and listen to my audio book while I make myself eggs, toast, and a fruit bowl.</p>



<p>10:15 a.m. — My co-worker calls me asking for help with something. We also catch up and chat about what’s been going on in our lives since we last connected, and I eat my breakfast. </p>



<p>10:30 a.m. — I spend the rest of the morning working on the task my co-worker and I chatted about. </p>



<p>1:00 p.m. — I break for lunch and whip up a quick bowl of tuna salad. While I’m on my lunch break I scroll through Ravelry looking for a pattern to use up some extra yarn I have from a baby sweater project. A year ago, I really got into knitting and haven’t stopped since I picked up knitting needles for the first time. I purchase a small neck scarf pattern called the <a href=""https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/my-jose-scarf"">My Jose Scarf</a>. I cast on the project and knit a few stitches before logging back in for work. <strong>$8.20</strong></p>



<p>3:00 p.m — Work is slowing down for the day so I decide to get a head start on dinner. F. and I have evening commitments so I’m hoping this will get dinner on the table faster. Dinner tonight is <a href=""https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020419-pasta-alla-norma-sorta"">Pasta Alla Norma Sorta</a> from NYT Cooking. F. comes home from his job and we catch up for a few minutes in the kitchen.</p>



<p>4:45 p.m. — I check my emails and Teams messages before riding my bike to group tennis lessons from 5-6 (I prepaid for the session a few weeks ago but it’s typically $259 for 8x 60-minute lessons). I started taking tennis lessons last March and have fallen completely in love with the sport! I’m still very much a beginner tennis player, but I’ve signed up for my first ladies’ tennis league this fall. Expectations of winning are low, but I’m still planning on having fun!</p>



<p>6:15 p.m. — Back from tennis and F. is already settled into his online chemistry class. I check emails and Teams once more before logging off for the day and taking a shower. I’m grateful my past self did all the dinner prep. All that’s left to do is heat and assemble. I finish listening to my audiobook while I get dinner together. </p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — F. has a break from his online class so we eat dinner together for a few minutes. F. recently decided on a career change and is finishing up some pre-reqs on online community college. The plan is to take the MCAT after this and then apply for med school (big life change)! After dinner, I clean up the kitchen, and walk P. once more before relaxing with my knitting project and watching reality TV for the rest of the evening. </p>



<p>10:00 p.m. — We get ready for bed and read for a little while before falling asleep. F. is reading his chemistry textbook and I’m reading<em> Fates and Furies</em> by Lauren Groff.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $8.20</strong></p>



<h3>Day Two: Tuesday </h3>



<p>6:30 a.m. — We wake up early today since F. has a job, so he needs to head out the door early this morning. F. makes coffee as I work through the NYT Games for the day. The Wordle really stumps me!</p>



<p>8:00 a.m. — I check in on my emails and check off a task for the day. F. heads out the door and I follow behind with P. I call my mom and catch up while I walk the dog. My mom lets me know that they are coming up to Chicago for Thanksgiving and this puts me in a good mood. Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday and I love to host!</p>



<p>9:00 a.m. — I’m back online for work for the rest of the morning. I get a CC alert that $20 has been reloaded on the city street parking account. F. must have arrived at his job (this is a work expense and we will get reimbursed from the client). I take a quick break to make breakfast and eat in front of my computer while responding to emails.</p>



<p>12:00 p.m. — During my lunch break I go to the public tennis courts near our condo and practice my serve for a while. As a beginner tennis player, serves are 100% the hardest skill to learn!</p>



<p>1:00 p.m. — On the way home from the courts I stop at my neighborhood market and grab a bell pepper, turkey, iceberg lettuce, olives, mozzarella, and black olives to make a chopped salad for lunch. <strong>$22.05</strong></p>



<p>1:15 p.m. — When I get home I throw together my lunch salad and settle in for work for the rest of the afternoon. F. gets home from his job around 3 p.m. and makes salad with the ingredients I bought. </p>



<p>4:00 p.m. — I get an email that my tennis league didn’t have enough people sign up for the bracket and is being cancelled and refunded. I end up signing up for Gladiator Tennis, which I’ve heard of players using for league play. After my serve practice, I’m feeling hopeful I won’t totally embarrass myself and sign up for the beginner/intermediate league. <strong>$35</strong></p>



<p>6:00 p.m. — The rest of the afternoon was spent working from the couch. I got my period and was majorly knocked down by cramps and PMS. F is already in class so I peel myself off the couch to walk P. around the block. </p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — Dinner is leftovers from yesterday. F. eats while he’s in online class and I eat while watching TV. I feel a little guilty about being so lazy this evening while F. is being productive in school. </p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — F. wraps up class early so we walk P. around the neighborhood one more time, and then come home and wind down watching PBS before getting ready for bed. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $57.05</strong></p>



<h3>Day Three: Wednesday </h3>



<p>8:00 a.m. — We wake up and F. makes coffee while I play the NYT Games for the day and work on a few rows of knitting. F. talks about going to the gym this morning and I tell him I might come, too.</p>



<p>9:00 a.m. — I log onto my computer to get started on work for the day. The last week of August is usually my slowest week of the year, so there isn’t a whole lot I need to be doing for the rest of the week. As a “high earner” with a WFH job, I feel a lot of guilt/shame around slow periods. November through July is generally very busy and then it slows down for a few months. </p>



<p>10:00 a.m. — We take P. around the block and then head to the gym. I put on a spooky podcast when I get to the gym and do a leg workout. </p>



<p>11:15 a.m. — F. makes eggs, toast, and fruit for us for breakfast when we get home and I do a little bit of work on my laptop. </p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — I hop on a call to discuss landing pages that are being built for an upcoming campaign I’m managing. I often work with and project manage the digital and content teams and feel grateful that they’re a nice bunch of people to work with. We all give feedback and talk through some options for the Q4 campaign I’m leading.</p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — After my meeting, I take a quick little snack break and have some honey roasted almonds and remind myself to drink a glass of water. F. sees I’m up from my desk and also takes a study/snack break. We talk about going to Key West for his spring break in March. We’ve never been to Key West and we’ve never taken a spring break before. I send F. a few links to the Key West Historic Inns once I’m back at my desk.</p>



<p>3:15 p.m. — Work is wrapping for the day and I get a jump start on dinner since F. and I will be out for the evening. Tonight’s dinner is <a href=""https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1025436-one-pot-chicken-and-rice-with-caramelized-lemon"">chicken and rice from NYTimes Cooking</a>. </p>



<p>3:30 p.m. — While the chicken and rice is in the oven, I take P. out for a walk and clean up the kitchen a bit. F. and I sit down for an early dinner before getting ready to head out. After dinner, F. drops me off at tennis on his way to night class. One night a week he’s in person for a lab.</p>



<p>6:00 p.m. — After tennis, my friend and I grab a drink at a wine bar in our neighborhood and cheers to playing well during class! <strong>$28.25</strong></p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — I enjoy a nice late summer walk home through the neighborhood. August is the sweetest month of all and I always feel such a warm, fuzzy feeling walking around this time of year. I’m sure the wine was helping perpetuate this feeling!</p>



<p>8:15 p.m. — Home from tennis and I take an ‘everything shower’ before making a yogurt bowl and chilling with my knitting project while watching <em>Southern Charm</em>. I was turned on to <em>Southern Charm</em> after watching the latest season of <em>The White Lotus</em>. F. gets home around 9:30 p.m. and he fills me in on his first day of in-person class, and we hang out for a bit before getting ready for bed.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $28.25</strong></p>



<h3>Day Four: Thursday</h3>



<p>7:30 a.m. — I wake up and get ready quickly for my first meeting of the day. </p>



<p>8:00 a.m. — I meet with a colleague in Europe and we discuss projects we’re collaborating on. F. makes coffee in the kitchen and we drink our coffee together after I wrap up my meeting. </p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — F. asks if I ordered the sound machine yet (I haven’t). We decide on an old school fan-based sound machine. I get started on a little bit of work and message with one of my coworkers about a final report for a project we’re wrapping up. <strong>$60.63</strong></p>



<p>10:00 a.m. — F. gets ready for the gym and I get ready to take the dog on a walk. I walk F. to the gym and then stop at a local cafe for a breakfast sandwich before heading home and getting back to work. <strong>$14.79</strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — F. has been working on his chemistry homework all morning. Weirdly, the chem textbook does not come with an answer guide to check your work, so he purchases a used solutions manual to help him with studying. <strong>$27.44</strong></p>



<p>1:00 p.m. — I have my weekly check-ins with two of my co-workers. We all agree it’s been such a slow week but also nice to come up for air after our busy season this summer. </p>



<p>3:00 p.m. — I have a psychiatrist appointment to check in on the anxiety medication I’m taking. I had a really scary panic attack where I ended up in the emergency room earlier this year so I have 100% been prioritizing my mental health. Anxiety is something I’ve struggled with since I was a kid and this year I feel like I’m finally taking the steps for treatment. Because I’ve hit my out of pocket max for the year, my co-pay is $0. </p>



<p>3:45 p.m. — I stop for gas and at Whole Foods on my way home to pick up magnesium glycate (recommended by my psych for sleep) and a very balanced snack of cheese balls and a protein drink. I also grab some sugar that’ll I need for the baking project I’m working on this weekend. <strong>$73.25</strong></p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — I wrap up work for the week and throw together a quick dinner of rice leftovers, broccoli, and shrimp from the freezer for F. and I to have before he has class, and I head out for my evening activity. </p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — Every Thursday, my local knitting shop has a ‘knit circle’. This is the shop where I learned to knit a year ago and I really enjoy the community space they’ve built. I haven’t been to knit night all summer so I make sure to bring a few of my finished objects to share. Vibes are great and I promise to myself I’ll be back again next week. </p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — Home and snacking on the rest of the cheese balls while I watch TV and knit and F. finishes with his online class. Once he’s done, we catch up and get ready for bed. </p>

<h3>Day Five: Friday </h3>



<p>8:00 a.m. — I have the day off so F. and I wake up a little later. I don’t know if it’s a placebo, but I did sleep a lot better last night after taking the magnesium! F. and I have sex before getting out of bed and making coffee. </p>



<p>10:00 a.m. — F. and I meet up with one of my friends to play some two-on-one. We play for about an hour and a half and it’s so much fun. I love the endorphins I get from playing tennis. </p>



<p>12:00 p.m. — Home from tennis and we have some breakfast. After knit night, I’m feeling inspired to order the boucle yarn I need to start a pattern I bought months ago. I also buy an extra skein of yarn for the scarf project I’m working on since it looks like I’m going to lose a game of yarn chicken. <strong>$165.15</strong></p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — I shower and get ready to go to therapy. I go every other week, and to be honest, I find talk therapy a little bit tedious and exhausting but I go on the recommendation of my psychiatrist. I have to take the train because F. is about to head out of town for the weekend for a film festival. F. will be staying at his parents’ place and any expenses incurred, i.e. meals, etc., this weekend are business write-offs. </p>



<p>2:00 p.m. — Once I get to the office I realize I messed up the dates and I actually don’t have therapy until next week — whoops! Instead of therapy, I take a long walk through the neighborhood and stop at a few shops. I pick up three birthday cards and a baby card at Hazel — they have the best selection of cards. <strong>$25.91</strong></p>



<p>2:30 p.m. — I make a few more shopping stops on my way home. Next stop is a local apothecary to pick up Ilia Limitless Lash Mascara. I also stop at the running store to pick up energy snacks for some of the tennis meetups and matches I have. Last stop is the grocery store to pick up a few ingredients for lunch, and baking ingredients to do a practice run of my friend’s wedding cake I’m making in September. <strong>$77.62</strong></p>



<p>5:00 p.m. — After the impromptu shopping afternoon, I come home and made a Costco frozen pizza. While the oven pre-heats and the pizza cooks I eat the broccoli leftovers from last night. I relax on the couch for a while before taking P. on a long walk. F. ended up taking the toll roads to Michigan since the holiday weekend traffic was looking bad. <strong>$17.10</strong> <strong>(tolls). </strong></p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — I spend a majority of the evening working on a practice cake for my friend’s wedding next month. The recipe I’m using is Claire Saffitz’s confetti cake — it’s such a good recipe and is my go-to for the foster care birthday cakes I make volunteering. </p>



<p>9:30 p.m. — Cake baking goes well but at this point I’ve made two failed attempts at marshmallow buttercream. I clean up the kitchen and decide that frosting the cake is a tomorrow task. I relax and watch TV while knitting the rest of the evening. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $285.78</strong></p>



<h3>Day Six: Saturday </h3>



<p>8:00 a.m. — P. wakes me up with a wet nose in the face and we snuggle in bed while I do the NYTimes Games. After this I get up and make a latte —still using the Breville Espresso Maker! While I drink my coffee, I crack open the holy grail cake cookbook, <em>The Cake Bible</em> by Rose Levy Beranbaum and scour the buttercream recipes until I find one that sounds like it will go well with the confetti cake. </p>



<p>9:00 a.m. — I have a 10 a.m. tennis meet-up so I take P. around the block and make a quick breaky of scrambled eggs and fruit. Then I get ready and put a backpack together with my racket, waterbottle, knitting, and a book. I’m not going to go home right away after tennis. </p>



<p>9:50 a.m. — I hop on my bike and arrive a few minutes early, hoping to snag a court, which I do! My tennis partner and I warm up and play a set. I lose 2-6, but still have fun and felt good about my serves. </p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — First stop of the day after tennis is Loba. I get a housemade melon soda and a strawberry sourdough muffin. I settle in at a table to work on my knitting and start listening to a new audiobook, <em>Don’t Let Him In</em>. Coincidentally, the two gals next to me were also knitting and we share a moment talking about what we’re working on. The knitting community is alive and well in Chicago! <strong>$14.15</strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — Next stop is Paulina Meat Market to grab an Italian sub. I’m back on my bike headed towards the lake to enjoy my sandwich, and a little more knitting while I listen to the audiobook. <strong>$13.78</strong></p>



<p>2:00 p.m. — I don’t have enough butter in the fridge to do the meringue buttercream recipe so I stop at the local market on the way home and buy more butter. It kills me to buy butter at this price so I make a mental note to stock up at Costco next time. <strong>$6.64</strong></p>



<p>2:15 p.m. — P. greets me at the door and I get straight to work prepping all the ingredients for the butter cream. All goes well with the new buttercream recipe and I finish up with the cake project for the weekend. </p>



<p>4:30 p.m. — I take P. for a long walk to the river before the sun goes down. When I get home, I take a shower, clean up the kitchen and make tacos for dinner. </p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — I try a slice of the cake I made and it’s heavenly — can’t wait to bring some to my friend tomorrow morning! The rest of the night is spent working on my knitting project and watching <em>Southern Charm</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $34.57</strong></p>



<h3>Day Seven: Sunday</h3>



<p>8:00 a.m. — P. wakes me up again and we snuggle in bed while I play the daily NYTimes Games. </p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — I make a latte and watch <em>Sunday Morning</em> while working on some knitting. After this, I walk P., have some breakfast, and get ready to meet up with a friend for tennis. </p>



<p>10:00 a.m. — We don’t have to wait long for an open court, thankfully! My friend and I have a nice long warm-up and then play a match. I get my a** handed to me and lose 6-0, 6-0. I still have fun and score a few points and remind myself the only way to get better is to keep playing!</p>



<p>12:00 p.m. — After tennis, I go home, take a shower, and get the laundry for the week started. Our condo building doesn’t have in-unit hook-ups, so we’re still using coin-operated in the basement. It’s not glamorous but it gets the job done. <strong>$4.50</strong></p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — F. is home from his weekend away and I’m starving for lunch! We go on a long walk through the neighborhood and get sandwiches and Diet Cokes at L&amp;M, which we eat in the park and catch each other up on our weekends. <strong>$37.42</strong></p>



<p>3:30 p.m. — When we get home from lunch we have some of the cake I made yesterday. F. gives his best Paul Hollywood critique. The rest of the afternoon is spent working on knitting projects and watching TV. I’m pretty tired from the two hours of tennis. F. takes a nap and works on his chemistry homework for a bit. </p>



<p>6:00 p.m. — F. and I walk P. around the block. When we get home we open a bottle of wine and have the tacos from yesterday for dinner. We chat for a bit before F. resumes his chem homework and I get back to knitting. </p>

For virtually all of my teen years, I blasted my face with salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide — anything that claimed to target acne, I slathered with reckless abandon. It wasn't until my 20s that I finally put down the harsh products and picked up gentler ones that targeted breakouts without the slash-and-burn-farming approach — this is how I discovered <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/niacinamide-for-skin"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">niacinamide</a>. <br /> <br />If you ask me, niacinamide (a form of vitamin B3) is well-deserving of its hype, and it’s not unusual to see it laced into not only skincare products, by makeup primers, skin tints, and foundations nowadays. The ingredient is often name-checked by dermatologists for its multifaceted benefits: curbing excess oil, minimizing the appearance of large pores and fine lines, and soothing flare-ups due to inflammation or acne.  <br /> <br />“Niacinamide works by modulating inflammation and supporting the skin barrier, which is especially important for acne-prone and reactive skin,” explains dermatologist Jenna Queller, MD. She adds, “It also helps regulate sebum production [natural oils produced by the skin], reduce the transfer of pigment within the skin, and improve skin elasticity, contributing to brighter, more even-toned skin over time.” In other words, it's an all-in-one skincare ingredient with near-universal appeal. <br /> <br />Ahead, I've rounded up some of my favorite products that include the star ingredient — from niacinamide cleansers to serums to moisturizers. <br /> <br /><em>At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.

/>I've been using this stuff on repeat for a few reasons. For starters, the price is right, and for an acne cleanser, it's not over-stripping, thanks to CeraVe’s signature ceramide complex and hyaluronic acid. Plus, it works wonders to ward off new breakouts, thanks to antibacterial salicylic acid, which also exfoliates deeply but gently, preventing clogged pores, not to mention niacinamide to mop up oil and boost the skin barrier.  <br /><br /><strong>CeraVe</strong> Renewing SA Cleanser, $, available at <a

/><figcaption><h2>Naturium Niacinamide Cleansing Gelée 3%</h2><br />If a hydrating essence and a gel cleanser had a baby, this would be it. You can apply it as the first step in a double cleanse to remove makeup, or on wet skin to whisk away dirt and oil, leaving behind a bright, balanced complexion. In addition to niacinamide, this formula contains sodium hyaluronate (a form of hyaluronic acid), plus sodium ascorbyl phosphate, a water-soluble, stable form of vitamin C. <br /><br /><strong>Naturium</strong> Niacinamide Cleansing Gelée 3%, $, available at <a

Essence<br /></h2><br />Then I Met You (founded by Charlotte Cho, the brains behind K-beauty retailer Soko Glam) has been something of a best-kept secret — until now. This hydrating, brightening essence contains yeast-derived galactomyces ferment filtrate and saccharomyces ferment filtrate to reduce the appearance of large pores and curb sebum. (TL;DR fermented skin care ingredients tend to be more effective and are easily absorbed by the skin thanks to the molecules being much smaller.) Besides these smart ingredients, it contains a 5% concentration of niacinamide to brighten and soothe skin. <br /><br /><strong>Then I Met You</strong> The Giving Essence, $, available at <a

Serum<br /></h2><br />Eadem’s Milk Marvel Serum is uniquely formulated by and for people with melanin-rich skin, meaning that it targets excess pigment without lightening or bleaching your overall skin tone. Niacinamide is a key ingredient in the formula, along with papaya and pineapple enzymes, to target concerns like dullness and hyperpigmentation at the source.  <br /><br

Cin Niacinamide Face Serum<br /></h2><br />Dr. Queller recommends this gentle yet effective formula for its pairing of niacinamide with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, zinc PCA, and aloe

<p><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Signature Lip Blush</a> is the latest addition to Merit’s growing lip lineup. You might know — and love — its <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/merit-beauty-products-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Signature Lipstick,</a> which occupies a cozy space between matte and glossy, giving lips a subtle satin-like glint. Or perhaps the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/merit-beauty-products-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shade Slick lip oil</a> is a staple in your handbag. <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"">Signature Lip Blush</a>, however, dials the shine all the way back. </p>



<p>Merit describes <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"">Signature Lip Blush</a> as a “sheer matte lightweight, buildable formula with a comfortable, balm-like feel”. To me, it’s a soft matte lipstick that’s not too dissimilar from a lip stain — packed with pigment — or a lip pencil, which you can diffuse with your fingers or a brush.  </p>



<p>If you’re just as obsessed as I am with celebrity makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ninapark/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nina Park</a>, specifically the way she makes her clients’ lips appear contoured, plump, and diffused, then I have a feeling you’re going to love this lipstick. On application, it’s sheer and light enough to blend outward, but unlike others with a similar texture, once it dries down a little, it clings to lips for a good four hours without disappearing into nothingness. </p>



<p>That’s all down to what Merit calls gel-wrapped pigments — essentially molecules of color encapsulated in a gel-like texture that makes swiping and blending easy. Speaking of color, there are eight shades in total, spanning Andie (a delicate petal pink) to Gamay (a deep red wine). Here, I’m wearing September, a muted terracotta, paired with Merit’s <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-liner%3F_pos%3D1%26_psq%3DSignature%2BLip%2BLiner%26_ss%3De%26_v%3D1.0"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Signature Lip Liner in Mayfair,</a> a peachy mauve. I will say the lipstick bullet appears a little darker than it does on the lips.</p>

<h2>What makes Merit’s Signature Lip Blush Special? </h2>



<p>What sets <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"">Merit’s Signature Lip Blush</a> apart from other soft matte lipsticks is how it feels on. Most matte products dry out my parched lips even further, settling into — and accentuating — lines and creases. This one feels so comforting, it’s like wearing a lip balm — all without any stickiness. You can thank sesame seed extract, nourishing olive oil, and plant-based waxes for that. </p>



<p>I judge makeup first and foremost on how it makes me feel, but when others notice, it’s affirming. Since giving <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"">Signature Lip Blush</a> a trial run these past few weeks, I’ve had countless compliments on my lipstick, with beauty editor peers repeatedly asking what I’m wearing — we’re convinced it makes my lips appear bigger. </p>



<h2>What to know about Merit’s Signature Lip Blush:</h2>



<p>• Sheer, matte lipstick with a moisturizing balm-like feel. </p>



<p>• Available in eight shades from rose brown through to bordeaux.  </p>



<p>•  Lends a diffused, blurred finish to lips and stays put for hours. </p>



<h2>How do you use Merit’s Signature Lip Blush? </h2>



<p>Because <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Signature Lip Blush</a> is so balm-like, I don’t have to be precise when I apply it. Usually, I line my lips and even use a lip brush before any lipstick, but with this, I can swipe it on haphazardly — without a mirror — and still end up with perfect, pillowy lips. Maybe that’s the blurred-lip trend talking, but the texture makes it so easy. </p>



<p>If you’re applying it a little more thoughtfully, it looks even better paired with a darker lip pencil and blurred ever so slightly over the lines, again lending that Nina Park effect. I love that the lipstick bullet boasts a squoval shape, which makes light work of tracing your lip line if you don’t have a lip pencil to hand. </p>



<p>Ultimately, this is the perfect lipstick for lipstick skeptics and obsessives alike — low-maintenance, wearable, and hard to mess up. I currently have three in my handbag.</p>

<p>Rejoice! As we enter Pisces season, we’re also getting closer to spring. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/february-monthly-horoscope-2026-meanings-effects"">From February 18th to March 20th</a>, the sun will be splashing around in the enigmatic water sign of Pisces, heightening our intuition, and creativity. This year, Pisces season brings wisdom, reflection, and a lot of wildness in between. Things are going to get messy, so prepare for the drama-of-it-all. Before we get sea sick from the rapid changes, it’s important to learn how to flow with ease through the turbulent waters ahead. Luckily, the stars and planets will <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">help us predict the journey</a>.</p>



<p>In previous years, Saturn and Neptune have added restriction and paranoia to the mix when the sun was in Pisces. Now, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/saturn-in-aries-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Saturn and Neptune are in Aries</a>, still stirring up problems, but not making us insecure and unsure about the road ahead. February 20th brings the conjunction of the two, urging us to pursue our dreams at any cost — even if it means hurting others in the process. We aren’t going to stand idly by and watch situations unfold; we’re going to take an active approach to drive change. We are more confident, aggressive, tenacious, and tougher than before.</p>



<p>For the first part of the solar return, there will be a stellium in mystical Pisces (the sun, Mercury, Venus, and Mars). We’ll be stubborn in our delusions, only accepting our reality as the correct one, which is problematic. As a result, arguments can ensue, especially if we do not back down. Finding the middle ground is useful; however, it’ll be difficult to understand others when we put our desires first and throw logic out the window. Taking a beat to center our energy requires patience and consideration — sentiments we may be lacking in the heat of the moment. </p>



<p>Mercury retrograde in Pisces begins on February 26th and lasts until March 20th, when the sun ingresses into Aries, and the spring equinox melts the ice away. The Mercurial moonwalk is going to raise our anxieties from the immense miscommunications and frenetic vibes. The universe wants us to go inwards, allowing us to focus on internal healing. Former partners will resurface, promising the world, when they have no intention of staying. Things are feeling intangible, and the wishy-washiness makes us lose our way. Choosing compassion connects us to people and gives us the strength to rise above the tides.</p>



<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">total lunar eclipse in Virgo</a> on March 3rd keeps our head above water by offering a chance to have a pragmatic approach to resolving matters. The blood moon is letting us see through the darkness, like a lighthouse illuminates the ocean, keeping us afloat. The caveat is that lunar eclipses are fast and furious, so the information being brought to our attention might shake us up, forcing us to make decisions. The retrograde pauses us from being direct or able to cut off the negativity, leaving us riddled with confusion, disillusionment, and frustration. I told you it was going to be chaotic! </p>

<h3>Key Astrological Dates For Pisces Season: </h3>



<p><strong>February 18th:</strong> The sun enters Pisces, making us tender, imaginative, romantic, and sentimental. Our hearts and emotions guide the way forward.</p>



<p><strong>February 20th:</strong> Saturn conjuncts Neptune in Aries, allowing this once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon to bring evolution and a metamorphosis on a global level. Outdated systems fall and new ones emerge.</p>



<p><strong>February 26th:</strong> Mercury Retrograde in Pisces commences, bringing travel issues, missed texts or emails, and the revival of old foes or exes for another hurrah (if we let them). </p>



<p><strong>March 2nd:</strong> Mars enters Pisces, pushing us to rebel and assert our views — although, we’ll have a few doubts about what we want to fight for or pursue.</p>



<p><strong>March 3rd:</strong> The lunar eclipse in Virgo is a moment of clarity and truth. How we react and deal with the energy will augment and shift our lives. </p>



<p><strong>March 6th: </strong>Venus enters Aries, motivating us to take the lead in relationships and to pursue our dreams.</p>



<p><strong>March 10th:</strong> Jupiter in Cancer ends the retrograde cycle that began on November 11th, 2025. Abundance and luck are coming!</p>



<p><strong>March 18th:</strong> The New Moon in Pisces is an opportunity to manifest our hopes and goals for the new season that comes two days later.</p>

<p>Black hair has a way of carrying everything. Memory. Care. Pressure. Pride. Each ritual rooted in purpose. On this episode of <em>Go Off, Sis</em>, the conversation feels less like an interview and more like a collective exhale, as the hosts dig into the rituals, rules, and quiet truths that shape Black women’s hair journeys.</p>



<p>The episode is presented in partnership with <strong><a href=""https://www.target.com/c/celebrate-black-history-month/-/https://www.target.com/c/celebrate-black-history-month/-/N-bw2fbN-bw2fb"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Target</a></strong> and their Black History Month Collection, which highlights the power, purpose, and intention behind Black founders and the communities that inspire them. The connection is clear in this conversation, which highlights women whose careers are rooted in care, access, and showing up for Black communities in tangible ways.</p>



<p>Beauty founder <strong><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/darealbbjudy/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jesseca Dupart</a></strong> brings the perspective of someone who understands hair as both personal and collective. Her approach to building has always extended beyond products. It is about creating tools that help Black women feel confident, supported, and seen, especially in spaces where their needs have historically been overlooked. Her work and products show community impact matters just as much as innovation.</p>



<p>That sense of care and purpose becomes deeply tangible with celebrity hairstylist<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lacyredway/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> </a><strong><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lacyredway/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lacy Redway</a></strong>, whose stories blur the line between ritual and profession. Growing up Jamaican, she remembers sitting between her sister’s legs every Sunday as her hair was washed, twisted, and prepped for the week. When the hosts chime in with memories of familiar wash-day routines, the moment feels instantly shared, grounding the conversation in experiences many Black women recognize.</p>



<p>As an adult working across red carpets, magazine covers, and film sets, Redway says that intimacy never disappears. “We’re not just doing hair. We’re creating safety,” she explains, describing the trust required when working with clients in industries where Black hair is still misunderstood or minimized. From editorial shoots to major premieres, she continues to push back against narrow ideas of what is considered professional or feminine, reminding us that textured hair does not need to be tamed to be worthy.</p>



<p>Throughout the episode, the conversation returns to a simple truth. Choice matters. Whether worn natural, braided, relaxed, covered, or completely undone, Black women deserve the freedom to decide how they show up without explanation.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955795.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>R29 babes, this week begins in the dark of the moon, and we can all feel it. In the days leading up to the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, emotions run high beneath the surface, even as many people pretend they’re unfazed. This is a charged combination. The Dark Moon is always a liminal space, a threshold where fears, insecurities, and unspoken truths rise up, both personally and collectively. You may notice avoidance, dissociation, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/therapy-healing-relationship-family-friends-impact"">or emotional numbness</a> as coping mechanisms. The invitation here is honesty, at least with yourself. What are you afraid of losing? Where have you been trying to stay neutral when neutrality no longer feels possible? This is not the week to bypass discomfort. It’s the week to witness it.</p>



<p>Everything shifts on February 17th, when the Aquarius Solar Eclipse strikes and the Year of the Fire Horse officially begins. This eclipse is electric, disruptive, and unapologetically revolutionary, especially because it squares Uranus, one of Aquarius’ ruling forces. On a collective level, this is volatile energy. Expect an uptick in unrest, protests, system shocks, and visible attempts by entrenched power structures to hold on tighter as their foundations crack. Aquarius eclipses do not negotiate with empires. They expose them. This square makes it clear that staying on the sidelines is no longer an option. Over the next six months, people will be forced to choose where they stand. Comfort, compliance, and silence become increasingly uncomfortable positions to maintain.</p>



<p>And yet, just as the revolution peaks, the cosmos reminds us to keep our hearts open. On February 18th, Pisces Season begins, and the sky fills with a powerful Pisces stellium. The sun, moon, Mercury, Venus, and the North Node all gather in Pisces, creating a countercurrent of compassion, empathy, and spiritual remembrance. This is not weakness. This is medicine. While Aquarius agitates and Aries ignites, Pisces insists that healing, love, and imagination remain central. This stellium asks us to believe in the best-case scenario even when the world feels like it’s cracking. It urges us to grieve what’s ending, tend to collective trauma, and remember that liberation without heart becomes hollow.</p>



<p>The week culminates on February 20th with a rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries, a once-in-a-generation alignment that fuses vision with responsibility. On a personal level, this can feel like a calling, a moment where dreams stop being abstract and demand action. Many people will feel compelled to step into leadership, creativity, or courage in new ways. Collectively, this alignment can catalyze the birth of movements, bold initiatives, and new identities rooted in purpose. The shadow is ego inflation, savior complexes, or mistaking impulse for destiny. The higher path is conscious courage: act from integrity, not adrenaline. This week reminds us that revolution isn’t just about tearing down what no longer works. It’s about building what comes next, with intention, imagination, and care.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, the week opens in the dark of the moon, and for you, this stirs the part of life tied to friendships, communities, and social dynamics. If the vibes have felt oﬀ lately, trust that you’re not imagining it. With Saturn and Neptune now in your sign, you’re more visible than usual, and visibility attracts everything… admiration, curiosity, and yes, sometimes jealousy. As we move through the final days of the Year of the Snake, this is a powerful time to release old alliances, unspoken tensions, or the need to prove yourself within certain circles. You don’t need to confront everything. Quietly choosing distance is just as effective.</p>



<p>Everything resets on February 17th, when the Aquarius Solar Eclipse <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/making-friends-connections-adulthood"">activates your friendship</a> and community realm. This is a fresh start. Over the next six months, you’ll either deepen bonds with true ride-or-dies or meet people who align with the version of you that’s emerging now. This eclipse can also accelerate your digital visibility. You may feel called to join a new collective, show up more online, or even create your own community or platform. If your circle feels small right now, don’t panic. This eclipse is planting seeds. Trust that the right people will find you as you step forward more authentically.</p>



<p>The energy softens on February 18th as Pisces Season begins, inviting you inward for reflection, spiritual integration, and rest. This gentler tone pairs powerfully with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in your sign on February 20th, a once-in-a-generation moment of identity transformation. Saturn asks you to take yourself seriously, while Neptune reminds you to stay connected to hope, imagination, and faith. Together, they mark the beginning of a long chapter where your dreams are no longer abstract. They’re asking to be lived. This week is not about having all the answers. It’s about trusting who you’re becoming and allowing your identity to evolve with intention, courage, and compassion.</p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, this is the kind of week you end up writing a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/01/11636388/daily-journaling-mental-health-benefits"">fifteen-page journal entry</a> about and still feel like you’ve only scratched the surface. As the week opens in the dark of the moon, your focus turns inward toward your career, reputation, and long-term direction. You may find yourself spiraling a bit, questioning whether the path you’re on is still worth the energy it demands. With the final days of the Year of the Snake wrapping up, this is a release moment. Titles, expectations, or goals that once felt motivating may suddenly feel heavy or outdated. Letting go now isn’t failure, it’s discernment.</p>



<p>The turning point arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which brings an undeniable aha moment around your public life and sense of purpose. This eclipse pushes you toward innovation and authenticity. You may feel inspired to pivot professionally, redefine success, or take a bold step that aligns more closely with your values. Over the next six months, this eclipse can radically change how you show up in the world, especially if you’ve been playing it safe to maintain stability. Growth now requires courage, not comfort.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, the energy softens and shifts toward friendships, networks, and shared visions for the future. You may feel drawn to people who feel emotionally safe, spiritually aligned, or creatively inspiring. This gentler tone pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating a more introspective zone of solitude, healing, and spiritual depth. This is about learning to trust your inner world rather than fear it. Your intuition is strengthening, not to overwhelm you, but to guide you. The more you honor quiet reflection this week, the clearer your next direction becomes.</p>

<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, this is one of those weeks where your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-get-a-good-sleep-reclaiming-rest"">brain is doing backflips</a> at 2 a.m. and suddenly everything feels <em>philosophical</em>. As the week opens in the dark of the moon, the spotlight turns to your beliefs, future plans, and the big “where am I actually going?” questions. You may feel restless, disillusioned, or torn between multiple paths. That’s not a sign you’re lost — it’s a sign something old is ready to go. In these final days of the Year of the Snake, release outdated narratives about who you’re supposed to be or what success is supposed to look like. You don’t need all the answers yet, just honesty with yourself.</p>



<p>Everything shifts on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which hits this same realm of growth, travel, education, and long-term vision. This is a genuine reset. Over the next six months, you may say yes to a new direction, commit to learning something transformative, relocate, publish, teach, or radically change your worldview. The square to Uranus means the pivot may come suddenly or feel slightly chaotic at first, but it’s freeing. This eclipse doesn’t want you stuck in analysis paralysis. It wants movement, even if the map isn’t fully drawn yet.</p>



<p>The energy softens on February 18th as Pisces Season begins, pulling your focus toward career, visibility, and your public voice. Your intuition starts guiding professional decisions more than logic alone. This blends powerfully with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating your community, networks, and long-term goals. You’re learning which dreams are worth committing to and which circles actually support your growth. Spiritually and socially, this is a maturation moment. You’re not here to float between possibilities forever. You’re here to choose a direction that feels meaningful and build toward it with intention.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955474.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cancer, this is one of those weeks where <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-intuition-gut-instinct-personal-safety"">your intuition is louder</a> than everyone else’s opinions combined, even if you’re trying to ignore it. As the week opens in the dark of the moon, deep emotional material rises around trust, intimacy, and shared resources. You may feel more sensitive than usual, or suddenly aware of where you’ve been over-giving, over-functioning, or holding emotional weight that isn’t yours to carry. With the Year of the Snake coming to a close, this is a powerful release window. Let go of attachments that drain you, even if part of you feels guilty doing so. Emotional boundaries are the medicine right now.</p>



<p>The breakthrough comes on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which activates a major reset around healing, vulnerability, and energetic exchange. Over the next six months, you may redefine how you share space, money, emotions, or power with others. This eclipse can bring sudden clarity around debts, dependencies, or emotional entanglements that need to be transformed. It’s uncomfortable at first, but ultimately liberating. You’re learning that closeness doesn’t have to mean self-sacrifice, and independence doesn’t have to mean isolation.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, the energy shifts in your favor, opening a gentler chapter focused on faith, learning, travel, and spiritual expansion. This flows beautifully with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, which activates your career and life-direction realm. You’re being asked to blend intuition with responsibility and dream with structure. Leadership may feel intimidating, but it’s calling you anyway. This week helps you trust that you can step into visibility without losing your emotional integrity. You’re not meant to hide right now. You’re meant to lead with care.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, this week feels like the plot twist you didn’t ask for but secretly needed. As the week opens in the dark of the moon, your relationships take center stage and not in a casual way. You may feel tension, distance, or emotional uncertainty around partners, close friends, or collaborators. This is the final stretch of the Year of the Snake, and it’s asking you to shed relationship dynamics that drain your vitality or keep you performing instead of being real. If something feels off, trust that instinct. You’re not meant to carry connections that dim your light anymore.</p>



<p>The reset arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, landing directly in your relationship realm. This is a big one. Over the next six months, your approach to partnership will radically evolve. New people may enter your life suddenly, or existing relationships may need to renegotiate terms around freedom, equality, and authenticity. With Uranus squaring this eclipse, expect surprises. Not all of them are comfortable, but they are necessary. This eclipse asks you to stop clinging to what looks good on paper and start choosing what actually supports your growth.</p>



<p>The tone shifts on February 18th as Pisces Season begins, pulling your focus toward healing, intimacy, and emotional honesty. This pairs powerfully with the rare Saturn– Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating your beliefs, values, and long-term vision. You’re learning to balance hope with discernment and passion with wisdom. This week reminds you that true confidence doesn’t come from controlling outcomes. It comes from trusting yourself enough to adapt, grow, and let relationships evolve alongside you.</p>

<h2>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Virgo, this is one of those weeks where your nervous system knows what your mind is still trying to rationalize. As the week opens in the dark of the moon, your focus turns to routines, health, work dynamics, and the way you spend your energy day to day. You may notice fatigue, irritation, or a strong urge to clean up systems that feel inefficient or draining. This is the final stretch of the Year of the Snake, and it’s asking you to shed habits that keep you busy but not fulfilled. You don’t need to fix everything at once. You just need to be honest about what’s no longer sustainable.</p>



<p>The turning point arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which resets your relationship with work, wellness, and service. Over the next six months, you may change jobs, shift schedules, adopt new health practices, or redefine what productivity actually means for you. With Uranus squaring this eclipse, the changes may feel sudden or disruptive at first, but they’re designed to free you from rigid expectations. This eclipse reminds you that efficiency without alignment <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/burnout-at-work-recovery-tips"">leads to burnout</a>. You’re allowed to design a life that works for your body and your spirit.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, attention shifts to your relationships and one-on-one connections. This softer energy blends with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating deep themes around trust, vulnerability, and shared commitments. You’re learning how to balance discernment with openness. This week encourages you to let others meet you halfway rather than carrying everything yourself. You don’t have to be the strong one all the time. Growth now comes from collaboration, not perfection.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Libra, this week opens with a subtle but emotionally charged dark of the moon, stirring your creative life, romantic longings, and desire for joy. You may feel strangely restless, uninspired, or unsure about where your passion has gone. That’s not a block, it’s a clearing. In these final days of the Year of the Snake, you’re being asked to release old narratives around love, attention, and validation. If something no longer feels fun, playful, or heart-expanding, it’s okay to admit that. This is a moment to let go of performative pleasure and reconnect with what genuinely lights you up.</p>



<p>Everything shifts on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which resets this same realm of romance, creativity, and self-expression. Over the next six months, you’re entering a new chapter around how you love, create, and take up space. This eclipse can spark a sudden romantic development, creative breakthrough, or renewed relationship with your inner child. With Uranus squaring the eclipse, expect surprises. You may feel pushed to take risks emotionally or creatively, even if it feels uncomfortable at first. The lesson here is freedom. You’re learning that joy doesn’t need permission.</p>



<p>The tone changes on February 18th as Pisces Season begins, redirecting attention toward your daily rhythms, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/salary-story-illness-work-life-balance"">work-life balance</a>, and emotional well-being. This softer energy pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating long-term shifts in your partnership and commitment zone. Big relationship themes are unfolding, starting with how you show up for yourself. This week reminds you that sustainable love and creativity come from alignment, not overcompromise. Let pleasure be honest. Let love be real.</p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, this week begins with a quiet confrontation between who you’ve been and who you’re becoming. As we move through the dark of the moon, old insecurities tied to home, family, and your emotional roots may resurface. You might notice familiar patterns trying to replay themselves, especially in these final days of the Year of the Snake. This isn’t a setback — it’s a moment of recognition. You’re being shown what no longer deserves repetition. The work here is awareness, not self-judgment. You can’t break a cycle you refuse to name.</p>



<p>The turning point arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which activates deep shifts around home, belonging, and emotional safety, while squaring Uranus in your partnership zone. This is liberating energy, even if it feels uncomfortable at first. Over the next six months, you may break free from relationship dynamics that mirror old wounds or finally speak truths you’ve been holding back. Some connections will strengthen because of honesty, while others may fall away because they can’t evolve with you. Either outcome is aligned. This eclipse asks you to choose emotional freedom over familiarity.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, your focus softens toward love, creativity, pleasure, and self-expression. This is a welcome shift after the intensity of the eclipse. It pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating your daily life, work habits, and long-term sustainability. You’re gaining momentum, but the lesson now is pacing. You don’t need to prove anything by overextending yourself. Structure and inspiration can coexist without burnout. This week teaches you that transformation is most powerful when it’s steady, intentional, and kind to your nervous system.</p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, this week feels like a mental and emotional reset that you didn’t know you needed until it arrived. As we move through the dark of the moon, your attention turns to communication, thought patterns, and the stories you tell yourself about where you’re headed. Old narratives, especially ones rooted in fear, comparison, or self-doubt, may resurface in these final days of the Year of the Snake. This is your cue to release them. You’re outgrowing a version of yourself that needed constant reassurance. Trust that clarity will follow honesty.</p>



<p>The breakthrough arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, activating your realm of learning, writing, speaking, and daily exchanges. Over the next six months, your voice evolves. You may launch a project, commit to sharing your ideas more publicly, or shift the way you communicate in close relationships. The square to Uranus brings sudden insights and unexpected conversations that push you out of your comfort zone. Say the thing. Ask the question. This eclipse reminds you that growth happens when curiosity outweighs fear.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, attention turns inward toward home, emotional safety, and the spaces that ground you. This softer energy pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating creativity, romance, and passion projects. You’re learning how to bring structure to joy and commitment to what you love. Just be mindful not to overdo it… inspiration doesn’t require exhaustion. This week teaches you that sustainable happiness comes from choosing depth over excess and meaning over momentum.</p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, this week begins with a reckoning around worth, security, and what you’re truly building toward. As we move through the dark of the moon, financial concerns, self-esteem patterns, or lingering fears around stability may rise to the surface. In these final days of the Year of the Snake, you’re being asked to release scarcity thinking and outdated definitions of success. If something has required too much effort for too little return, this is your signal. Letting go now creates space for a more aligned foundation to form.</p>



<p>The shift arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, activating your money and values realm. Over the next six months, you may experience a reset around income, priorities, or how you measure your own worth. With Uranus squaring this eclipse, changes may come unexpectedly. A new opportunity, a sudden expense, or a wake-up call around what truly matters could alter your path. This eclipse pushes you to innovate rather than cling to what’s familiar. Security now comes from adaptability, not control.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, your focus softens toward communication, learning, and emotional expression. This pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction on February 20th, activating deep shifts around home, family, and inner emotional structures. As a Saturn-ruled sign, you’re especially sensitive to this moment. You’re learning to build strength without rigidity and responsibility without emotional shutdown. This week reminds you that true resilience comes from honoring both your ambition and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/02/11275205/how-to-sleep-when-stressed-tips"">your need for rest</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, this week is personal in a way you can’t intellectualize your way out of. As the week opens in the dark of the moon in your sign, and the emotional focus lands directly on you… your identity, your body, your sense of self. You may feel unusually sensitive, exposed, or unsure of how you’re being perceived. That’s because something fundamental is shedding. In these final days of the Year of the Snake, you’re releasing an old version of yourself that learned how to survive, not necessarily how to thrive. Let the discomfort speak. It’s showing you where growth is overdue.</p>



<p>Everything changes on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse in your sign, a major reset that will echo for the next six months. This eclipse marks a turning point in how you show up in the world. With the eclipse squaring Uranus, one of your ruling planets, expect disruption, breakthroughs, and moments that force honesty. You may feel pulled between who you’ve been and who you’re becoming, especially in relation to home, family, or emotional security. This is not a quiet evolution. It’s visible. You can’t go back to playing small or staying neutral. The world is responding to the version of you that’s ready to lead differently.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, the focus shifts toward self-worth, money, and values, grounding the intensity of the eclipse into practical reality. This blends with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating your communication and mindset. You’re being asked to take your ideas seriously while still honoring imagination and intuition. The lesson this week is integration. You don’t have to choose between logic and vision. When you trust both, you become a powerful architect of the future you’re here to build.</p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, this week feels like the deep exhale before a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/february-monthly-horoscope-2026-meanings-effects"">brand-new chapter begins</a>. As the week opens with the dark of the moon, you may feel more introspective than usual, pulled toward solitude, memory, and emotional processing. Old fears, habits, or subconscious patterns may surface in these final days of the Year of the Snake, asking for closure. This isn’t about fixing yourself. It’s about forgiveness… of others, of circumstances, and of past versions of you who did the best they could with what they knew.</p>



<p>Everything shifts on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, activating your spiritual, subconscious, and healing realm. This is a powerful internal reset that will unfold quietly but profoundly over the next six months. You may feel called to rest more, create in private, or release attachments that no longer align with your emotional truth. With Uranus squaring the eclipse, sudden realizations or intuitive downloads can arrive unexpectedly. Trust what your inner voice reveals, even if it doesn’t make sense yet.</p>



<p>The tone softens and expands on February 18th as Pisces Season begins, placing the spotlight back on you and your personal journey. This is your time to emerge gently, not rush. It pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, which marks a once-in-a-generation moment of integrating dreams with responsibility. You’re learning that spirituality and structure don’t cancel each other out. They strengthen each other. This week reminds you that your sensitivity is not a liability. It’s the compass guiding you into the next era of your life.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/february-monthly-horoscope-2026-meanings-effects"">Eclipse season is here!</a> The onset of the annual solar and total lunar eclipse is bringing a fateful chance for us to transform. We are shifting our ideas and purpose to find our place in the world. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/yearly-horoscope-2026"">Eclipses help to show us</a> what we need to augment to live a fulfilling existence, and these are no different. The caveat is that we are expected to move forward gracefully, which is hard for anyone, especially since the energy packs a powerful punch that shakes things up unpredictably. Comprehending that some people’s situations and experiences must be shelved or that they must begin a new phase is easier said than done. Compassion for ourselves and others can help us. The only way out is through! See you on the other side!</p>

<h4><strong>The Annular Solar Eclipse In Aquarius</strong></h4>



<p>Take note: February 17th is set to be a momentous day. According to lunar astrology, not only does it usher in the Year of the Fire Horse, but the solar eclipse in Aquarius also occurs at 7:01 a.m. EST. This is the first eclipse that falls on the Aquarius and Leo lunar axis, which makes its formal move into these signs on July 26th. The eclipse activates the coming North Node of Destiny in Aquarius, urging us to usher in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2026-meaning-effects"">a new mindset</a>, and for us all to work cohesively to make global advances. We are a powerful force of nature when we come together.</p>



<p>A “ring of fire” annual solar eclipse is a rare lunar phenomenon that is the result of the moon moving between the sun and earth, while being far from the earth, making the moon look smaller than the sun. The result of the eclipse leaves a fiery look to the circular edges of the moon (in this particular case, the moon will appear that way for two minutes and 20 seconds at the peak of the eclipse). The eclipse is primarily visible from Antarctica. Other regions, such as South America, South Africa, and the Indian Ocean, will have partial views.</p>



<p>The solar eclipse in Aquarius aspects a sensitive point of the sign, known as an anaretic degree (the 29th degree). The urgency to grow and evolve is immediate. It is giving us a chance to embrace our unique sentiments and let them be known. The collective is changing, and we are evolving our minds with it. Because the planet Uranus, which is in Taurus, is active in the eclipse, it’s fair to say that this is the time of revolution. We are going to stand up for what we believe in and won’t back down. The results may be unpredictable at the moment, but the battle is worth fighting for. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h4>The Total Lunar Eclipse In Virgo</h4>



<p>On March 3rd at 6:38 a.m. EST, the total lunar eclipse in Virgo intensifies the sky, giving stargazers and astrology lovers an amazing sight to see and capture. The lunar eclipse is a time of release, since it connects to the South Node of Destiny in Virgo (on the current Pisces and Virgo lunar axis). We are departing from old views and emotions, making space for us to explore different philosophies. This is a moment of transcendence and reflection, so take a look back at what recently happened that is sparking a reaction that pushes us to run away from it. </p>



<p>During a total lunar eclipse, the moon appears to take on a reddish hue as it passes over the earth’s shadow. Known as the “Blood Moon,” total lunar eclipses are a moment of illumination and revelation. The lunar eclipse will be visible in the Western Americas, Australia, East Asia, and the Pacific Ocean, lasting around 59 minutes at its totality.</p>



<p>The lunar eclipse in Virgo receives a gentle push from Jupiter retrograde in Cancer, making a difference. Jupiter is known to be the planet of luck, but it can also expand matters that are in a delicate position in either good or bad ways. Problems can become bigger; however, Jupiter always ensures that the results are fortunate. The sting may feel intense at the moment, especially since Mercury retrograde in Pisces is causing ambiguity and confusion. Looking back on the eclipse, we’ll realize that letting go of the past was necessary. The moon in Virgo is a creature of comfort, which is why relinquishing control and healing will be challenging. In the end, it’ll be worth the sacrifice and ride.</p>

<p>So, I’m <strong><em>that</em></strong> friend. The one <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bucket-list-hotels-r29-editor-picks"">booking her hotel</a> on the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/12/11949132/christmas-travel-where-to-stay-hotel-new-york-city"">flight to the destination.</a> The one who buys her <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capsule-wardrobe-guide-tips"">full wardrobe</a> after getting there. The one with a non-existent itinerary and a deeply held belief that, “If we just walk outside, something will appear.” Some may call it impulsive, but I like to call it spontaneity with a little bit of chaos. </p>



<p>I’ll admit it, I’m a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/life-coach-lessons-type-a-personality"">Type A person’s</a> worst nightmare… and I had every intention of staying that way. That is, until Hilton invited me on a press trip with a handful of seasoned travel reporters, people who don’t just travel, but optimize it. Over dinner, two of them walked me through how they use points to unlock upgrades, experiences, and thousands of dollars in savings I didn’t even realize I was leaving behind.</p>



<p>And for my fellow Type B travelers who’ve been raw-dogging their way through travel, here’s how one Hilton-hosted weekend in West LA reformed me<strong>,</strong> without stripping away my go-with-the-flow energy. </p>



<p>I had just moved from New York to Los Angeles when Hilton reached out to host my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grammy-awards-red-carpet-fashion-2026"">Grammy Awards</a> weekend experience.I jumped at the opportunity to attend music’s biggest night and enjoy a little staycation. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959258.jpg?width=784&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=49%3A64"" /></figure>



<p>What I didn’t expect was horseback riding in Malibu, multi-course dinners on property, and a suite bigger than my NYC <em>and</em> LA apartments combined, all tied to <a href=""https://www.hilton.com/en/hilton-honors/"">Hilton Honors,</a> the brand’s loyalty program that gives members access to curated Grammys weekend packages, upgrades, and experiences I genuinely did not know you could redeem with Points.</p>



<p>And before you roll your eyes at the word “points,” I see you. Because if you’re anything like me, “points” sounds like something that requires 47 international flights and a corporate job with unlimited PTO. I am here to tell you: it’s not as unattainable as it sounds. Let’s break it down. </p>



<p>When you book direct or stay at Hilton properties, you earn points you can actually use, either toward free nights or by combining them with cash. You don’t need some impossible balance, you just use what you have.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959270.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>But what surprised me most is that it’s not just about rooms. Through <a href=""https://experiences.hiltonhonors.com/"">Hilton Honors Experiences</a>, Points can unlock actual moments, concert access, VIP sporting events, spa treatments, even Grammy weekend stays at <a href=""https://www.guestreservations.com/waldorf-astoria-beverly-hills/booking?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=969500850&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=969500850&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADiMQMYLTTERfRqL_lLG1CPWgLJh2&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAtLvMBhB_EiwA1u6_PqKbdLKIq-SYBhQbXWPtEgKHvICNxJYZYDbYnfDvDQqr7PLjdqchMBoCXKAQAvD_BwE"">Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills.</a></p>



<p>And then there are the small things that quietly upgrade your life: skipping the front desk with a digital key, choosing your room in advance, late checkout when you need it. And truuuust me, a girl like me will <em>always</em> need a late checkout. </p>



<p>But what if you’re not headed to the Grammys? What if you just want a moment away from the noise?</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959261.png?width=760&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=95%3A128"" /></figure>



<p>That’s exactly how I ended up on the back of a horse overlooking the Malibu coastline. Hilton partnered with a local outfitter and handled the logistics, transportation, timing, the whole setup, so all I had to do was show up. It’s an experience I would never, ever plan for myself, but it pulled me completely out of my comfort zone in the best way.</p>



<p>We split our stay between <a href=""https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/smoolol-oceana-santa-monica/?WT.mc_id=zLADA0AA1OL2PSH3GGL4AMPHTBRD_Oct5GNPLTPMWBRNLAB6SMOOLOL7EN8i142435__z22150182377z__&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;utm_campaign=%7Bcampaign%7D&amp;utm_adgroup=%7Badgroup%7D&amp;utm_keyword=oceana%20santa%20monica&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22150182377&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA-Q0XEachnVMaiJRrASK4anHY1hat&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAtLvMBhB_EiwA1u6_PsQYcgtXE2HDbyA6H3kXeVE9CLM74zjCDXK21WfEO_2Os5I2H-vsfxoCnpoQAvD_BwE"">Oceana Santa Monica</a> and <a href=""https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/laxwawa-waldorf-astoria-beverly-hills/"">Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills</a>, and they could not have felt more different. The Oceana was rooted in serenity and calm, the type of energy Santa Monica is known for. And if you stay there, head downstairs to the La Monique and grab the Escargot Poppers with garlic herb crème fraîche. Yes, they’re fried snails. And yes, they kind of remind me of mozzarella sticks. Soooo good. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959273.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>On the day of the Grammys, we stayed at the Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills. It felt like a slightly elevated experience and definitely had me feeling like a superstar for the day. The bathroom overlooked the city, the suite was polished and luxurious, and everything about it felt Grammys-coded. When my mom came to visit, we definitely had a pinch me moment. We’re just two girls from the deep-south after all! </p>



<p>All of this to say: points are  for everyone — including you, Type B traveler who still loves chaos but doesn’t mind leveling up. We can still, stubbornly, embrace the chaos while making our money stretch. </p>

How about some more R29 goodness, right here?</strong></p><p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-breakup-was-supposed-to-break-me-instead-it-sent-me-to-the-dr?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss_linkback1"">The Breakup Was Supposed to Break Me.</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/singapore-vacation-travel-experience-black-woman?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss_linkback2"">Black &amp; Unbothered In Singapore</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nicaragua-travel-experience-wedding-destination?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss_linkback3"">A Trip to Nicaragua Became My Wedding Inspo</a></p>",
