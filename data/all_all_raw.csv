<p>This tenant office building stands just steps from a subway station in the Ichibancho district of Tokyo's Chiyoda Ward—an area near the Imperial Palace (the former Edo Castle), steeped in history and culture. Conventional tenant office buildings generally house multiple companies within a single structure, yet their facades fail to reflect the diversity within. On top of this, they lack a sense of connection with the surrounding community and contribute little to the streetscape or the character of the local neighborhood. This project addresses these problems by creating a building that connects people to the surrounding urban environment while accommodating increasingly diverse work styles and values. To achieve this, two key architectural elements were incorporated: interior spaces defined by projecting bay windows and an open exterior space.</p>",

A thoughtful designer in an era of loud personalities… it’s a tidy version of him, and it’s true, but it leaves out important details that earn him a place in this series.</p><p>Madison spent his early career watching a country lose its footing. Under the Articles of Confederation, states behaved like independent rivals. New York taxed goods coming in from New Jersey. Virginia and Maryland fought over navigation rights. Each state was convinced it saw the situation correctly and expected the rest of the country to comply. Of course, it didn’t work that way, and what emerged instead was a tangled mess of competing systems that produced exactly the kind of chaos Madison feared.</p><figure><img alt=""Engraved illustration of Shays’ Rebellion showing armed state militia firing a volley in winter snow, with smoke rising from their muskets. Several rebels lie on the ground while others retreat or fall back, and additional militia stand in formation near buildings and leafless trees in the background."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/691/1*qrQ_rJl66qKb1vFVpye-iA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Shays Rebellion — America in class</figcaption></figure><p>Then came Shays’ Rebellion. A small group of farmers in Massachusetts pushed the state close to collapse over debt policy. Madison noticed how little it took to shake the whole system, and that moment told him more about the country’s stability than any debate ever had.</p><p>He saw the same instability inside Virginia. Religious groups (Anglicans, Baptists, Presbyterians) each fought to define public life according to their own doctrine. Each new majority produced a new attempt to legislate ‘certainty’ (a topic we’ll tackle another day). It convinced Madison that no group, no matter how principled, can be trusted with the whole system.</p><p>These observations led to a very important insight:</p><p><strong>People don’t balance themselves. Their interests need to be balanced for them.</strong></p><p>His education was important in helping him articulate this.</p><ul><li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montesquieu""><strong>Montesquieu</strong></a> warned about <strong>concentrated power</strong>.</li><li><a href=""https://lawliberty.org/why-we-need-humes-wisdom-on-factions/""><strong>Hume</strong></a> explained why <strong>factions form and why they don’t disappear</strong>.</li><li>The <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/event/Scottish-Enlightenment""><strong>Scottish Enlightenment</strong> </a>taught him that <strong>complexity survives by</strong> <strong>distributing conflict rather than suppressing it</strong>.</li></ul><p>So Madison built a republic that relied on a balanced system.</p><ul><li>A large republic makes it harder for any one group to dominate.</li><li>Layered governments force negotiation instead of obedience.</li><li>Separate branches introduce friction (deliberate, sometimes frustrating friction) to keep hardline views from turning into authority.</li><li>Even procedural delays weren’t accidents; they acted as insulation.</li></ul><p>Building and planning for durability, however, meant he could build for unity.</p><p>And this is the part of Madison worth remembering: <strong>he understood that certainty is a destabilizer.</strong> Once a group believes it sees the whole picture, it stops feeling like it needs to listen. Once listening stops, balance goes with it. And after balance, legitimacy is a fast follow.</p><p>The system he designed survives because this heavy load is ‘distributed’. We only really notice his work when someone tries to remove that balance.</p><p>*Cough cough*</p><figure><img alt=""Smiling Elinor Ostrom with gray hair and glasses, wearing a brightly patterned red and multicolor top, standing against a solid orange background."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1cuc5roaBnJwiz2pf1bEew.png"" /><figcaption>Elinor Ostrom</figcaption></figure><h3>Elinor Ostrom: The proof that balance can be built</h3><p>Elinor Ostrom usually appears in the public imagination as the first woman to win the <a href=""https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2009/ostrom/facts/"">Nobel Prize in Economics</a>. She spent her career far from academic models and closer to the places where cooperation was something people needed in order to eat, drink, farm and survive.</p><p>Her research took her into forests in Nepal, irrigation systems in Spain, fishing communities in Turkey and water boards in Los Angeles. Each place had the same problem in a different scenery: a shared resource, a mix of competing interests and the constant possibility that one group might push its agenda far enough to throw everything off balance.</p><p><a href=""https://sesmad.dartmouth.edu/theories/54#:~:text=In%201990%20Elinor%20Ostrom%20published,Self%2DMonitoring%3B%20Self%20Sanctions%3B"">Ostrom watched closely at how these communities behaved.</a> She noticed that the systems that worked well weren’t run by a single leader or by a perfectly unified community. Instead, they relied on rules that spread responsibility across the people who depended on the resource(s). Boundaries were clear. Rules were shaped by the people who had to live with them. Monitoring was handled locally (because outsiders didn’t understand). Disputes were settled quickly and without big ceremony. And when conditions changed, the rules changed with them.</p><p>These were places built by people who understood imbalance because they felt it the moment it appeared. That’s the heart of Ostrom’s contribution: <strong>Balance works when it’s shaped by the people closest to the problem.</strong></p><p>She saw that when decision-makers were at a distance from the decisions they were making, they had a confidence they hadn’t earned. The closer they were to the problem, the more careful they were with the solution.</p><p>Ostrom also paid attention to the early signs that signaled a system was in trouble. For instance, if a single group found ways to steer the rules in its favor, and the system lost its ability to balance out. The worst failures happened when outsiders stepped in with a single fix and applied it everywhere. Solutions that looked great from a distance often unraveled the arrangements that had kept the community stable in the first place.</p><p>This is important and confirmed something Madison understood intuitively: balance doesn’t maintain itself. It has to be built. And it’s built best through local negotiation, small adjustments, and shared constraints that prevent any one perspective from becoming the entire truth.</p><p>For her, balance was more resilience than a moral posture. And the places she studied didn’t have the luxury of ignoring that. They depended on it.</p><figure><img alt=""Mahmood Mamdani with gray hair, glasses, and a short beard sits on an outdoor bench, smiling gently. He wears a dark jacket, and the background shows a tree-lined park with soft, natural light."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/572/1*riS2Bhi7mJ6SQA4ea0t9KQ.png"" /><figcaption>Mahmood Mamdani</figcaption></figure><h3>Mahmood Mamdani: What happens when categories replace systems</h3><p>Mahmood Mamdani (yes, Zohran’s father) isn’t a household name, but his work explains something most people feel without knowing how to articulate it: Societies don’t fall apart because people disagree.</p><p>Where Madison studied factions and Ostrom studied shared resources, <a href=""https://anthropology.columbia.edu/content/mahmood-mamdani"">Mamdani studied the aftermath</a>. He saw that societies fall apart because people get sorted into identities so rigid that disagreement stops being part of politics and starts becoming the whole point of it.</p><p>His work in East Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East all circled the same problem: W<strong>hen politics harden around identity categories, balance becomes impossible. The categories do the thinking for you.</strong></p><p>What he found was more unsettling than ideological and was baked into the structure itself.</p><p>He showed how colonial administrations divided people into “natives” and “settlers,” assigning rights and responsibilities based on identity rather than citizenship. Once those categories were in place, everything that followed (representation, punishment, land access, even the definition of violence) was shaped by the category, not the behavior.</p><p><strong>The pattern was brutally consistent:</strong></p><ul><li>People stopped seeing each other as individuals and started treating each other as types.</li><li>Arguments became personal because they were tied to who someone <em>was</em>, not what they said or did.</li><li>And instead of working within the same rules, every group insisted its own view set the rules.</li></ul><p>Once a political system runs on identity rather than structure, the entire framework begins to tilt to one side. Laws formalize conflict rather than stabilize it and public life stops being about negotiation and becomes a contest to control the category that sits closest to power.</p><p>This is the core of Mamdani’s warning: <strong>once a group can define categories, it no longer needs to define the argument.</strong> The system starts carrying their weight for them.</p><p>Here are some of his examples:</p><ul><li>In Rwanda, colonial administrators turned fluid social identities into fixed racial categories, replacing political negotiation with inherited status. This was a shift that left the society permanently off-balance.</li><li>In Sudan, laws distinguished “tribes” in ways that reshaped land rights and obligations, guaranteeing that every political conflict would be read as ethnic rather than structural.</li><li>In Uganda, colonial policy created systems where citizenship and identity pulled in opposite directions, ensuring that no debate stayed a debate for long.</li></ul><p>Different places, same mechanics: C<strong>ertainty, hardened into identity becomes a destabilizer.</strong></p><p>And this is where Mamdani plugs directly into the argument I’m making.</p><ul><li>Madison feared the dominance of one single group.</li><li>Ostrom showed how to prevent it through shared rules and distributed responsibility.</li><li>Mamdani shows what happens when none of that holds true. When people collapse a complex political world into a few fixed categories and then defend those categories as if their survival depends on it.</li></ul><p>He explains the modern reflex where expanding someone’s frame feels like an attack. Nuance becomes betrayal, and balance? Well, that looks an awful lot like disloyalty.</p><p>I’m not saying people are unreasonable. I’m saying <strong>their political identity is doing too much work. </strong>Once that identity carries the whole argument, the whole thing starts to slide.</p><h3>Where All Three Collide</h3><p>You don’t need to be a political theorist to feel when a system is off-balance. People sense it in small ways before they can articulate it. A policy feels rushed. A rule changes too quickly. Decisions start to look engineered for someone else’s benefit.</p><p>What Madison understood, Ostrom proved, and Mamdani diagnosed is that imbalance isn’t dramatic… at first. It appears in places where one idea or one identity starts carrying more weight than it should. And once that happens, people react the same way they do when you widen their argument: they retreat into the part they understand and defend it like it’s the whole story.</p><p>You see this in every procedural fight we pretend is about ideology. Gerrymandering is a fight about boundaries. The filibuster is a fight about friction. Court expansions, emergency powers, rule changes, executive orders … each one chips away at the balances that were designed to slow certainty down.</p><p>What we don’t see is people panicking because of any specific outcome. The reason? Things change. Just wait a bit and balance should bring things back in order if it was a bad decision.</p><p>Don’t you think it’s interesting that panic actually comes from people reacting to systems when it’s those systems that feel like they’re being manipulated or unbalanced?</p><p>Madison would recognize the pattern immediately.<br />Ostrom would see the loss of shared constraint.<br />Mamdani would see identity doing more work than structure.</p><p>When a system becomes too easy to take advantage of, the people inside it start holding their positions tighter. Balance stops feeling like a responsibility and starts feeling like a betrayal. There’s an irony there that’s hard to miss.</p><p>The thing a plural society needs most is the first thing people abandon when they feel the least bit of instability.</p><p>And once identity becomes the primary way people organize themselves, even small adjustments feel like attacks. You’re not disagreeing with their idea; you’re threatening the category that idea is supposed to protect. The politics stops being about governance and becomes about defending a sense of self.</p><h3>Reflection</h3><p>This essay took me a while, but the longer I read about these three, the clearer the pattern becomes.</p><p>People cling to their ideas because the alternatives feel unsafe. Balance threatens certainty, and certainty is where people place their moral grounding.</p><p>But every system that survives (every republic, every community, every shared resource) survives for the same reason: it never lets one idea, one identity, or one group do all the work.</p><p>Madison designed for that.<br />Ostrom documented it.<br />Mamdani warns what happens when we lose it.</p><p>If the world feels louder or angrier than it used to, I don’t think it’s because we’re more divided.

<h4>Doing the right thing should be easy.</h4><figure><img alt=""Da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*APj-7duB_TuT3mOR.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man</figcaption></figure><p>Human engineering isn’t what you might think. It’s not a eugenic nightmare of bioengineering and gene selection. Thank goodness, it’s much more benign. Instead, human engineering is a multi-disciplinary field that brings together psychologists, engineers, cognitive scientists, organizational behavioral specialists, and designers. Their goal is to make it easy for people to do the right thing. [Redacted: High brow <em>“A Clockwork Orange” </em>joke] Sometimes referred to as interaction design or cognitive ergonomics, the aim of <a href=""https://www.dau.edu/glossary/human-engineering"">human engineering</a> is to improve human performance by looking at <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915002860"">systems</a>.</p><p>Simply put, human engineering tries to make it easier to do the right thing and harder to do the wrong thing for any task or activity. This aim is achieved through the design (and alteration of existing designs) of the technology, systems, and environments that individuals interact with. Immediately we see the application of human engineering into the paradigm of system dynamics and <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/the-architecture-of-human-error-ae69c732eb79"">human error</a>.</p><p>There are many principles of human engineering, but one of the most important is the importance of designing the interactions of humans and objects to <a href=""https://medium.com/@adnanmasood/human-compatible-engineering-value-alignment-in-artificial-intelligence-3ebb39222104"">align function with action</a>. To demonstrate, consider the very common scenario of turning on a burner on the kitchen stove.</p><h4>The Mysterious Case of the Wrong Burner</h4><p>Has it ever happened that you’ve gone to turn on the stove and lit the wrong burner? It’s not just you. It’s a very common problem and one of the most studied topics in the field of human engineering. Stoves are not advanced technology and lighting the stove only requires one turn of the knob. So how come we’re so prone to these simple mistakes?</p><p>The answer has to do with the way the alignment of form and function. Stovetops are tremendously bad at this alignment. Consider two popular configurations of commercial stoves:</p><figure><img alt=""Two stovetop configurations. One with knobs grouped, the other with them evenly spaced and linear."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/466/0*W7NsBm1XLq4jfD-G.png"" /><figcaption>Source: Design of Everyday Things</figcaption></figure><p>In typical stove designs (let’s call them Configuration A and Configuration B), we see that the burners are aligned as a 2x2 rectangle, whereas the knobs are aligned linearly along the front. The knobs and the burners are configured differently. To use a technical term, we could say that these configurations have poor <a href=""https://uxplanet.org/designing-for-spatial-ux-in-ar-vr-a-beginner-to-advanced-guide-to-immersive-interface-design-c55f092deb0b?gi=debcdfcae8a8"">spatial compatibility</a>.</p><p>Configuration B is slightly better than Configuration A, because there is a natural grouping between the two burners and knobs on the left and the two burners and knobs on the right. Nevertheless, in this configuration errors will be common and proper use will rely on reading the labels on the knobs or trial and error. In short, it takes some level of cognitive effort, beyond intuition to ensure consistent proper use of the stove.</p><h4>The Better Way</h4><p>Now consider two slightly different configurations. In Configuration C the burners are still arranged in a 2x2 rectangle, but now, the knobs are also arranged in a similar way. There is a natural alignment between the controls and the device. No labels are needed.</p><figure><img alt=""Two (different) stovetop configurations. One forming a dimaond the other an arch shape"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/457/0*RxPGxuDmbpJLxyB2.png"" /><figcaption>Source: Design of Everyday Things</figcaption></figure><p>Configuration D provides another natural and intuitive layout, but this time maintains the linear arrangement of the knobs. Simply by bringing the two back burners closer together to align with the knobs, the stovetop has gone from an inscrutable, error-prone appliance to something that is intuitive and easy to use.</p><p>Without objection, we can see why the stovetop configurations in Configuration C and Configuration D are better. Not only will these configurations produce fewer errors and lead to more consistent and effective operation of the stove but they also rely on intuition and require less cognitive processing to achieve the greater result! A win-win!</p><p>Oh by the way, how much did the change cost? We used the same space, the same controls, and the same materials. We can decrease errors, build resiliency, and decrease the cognitive load without sizable investments! Win-Win-Win!</p><h4>The Principle of Spatial Compatibility</h4><p>What we’ve just witnessed is the principle of <strong>spatial compatibility </strong>in action. This principle states that controls should be arranged to correspond naturally with the devices they control. When there’s a clear, intuitive mapping between control and function, people simply know what to do. No thinking required. No labels needed. No errors made.</p><p>This might seem obvious when pointed out, but look around your environment. How many poorly designed interfaces do you interact with daily? How many times do you have to stop and think about which button does what? How often do you make “simple mistakes” that are actually design failures?</p><p>The stove example illustrates a profound truth:<strong> </strong><a href=""https://www.visualexpert.com/Resources/humanvsdesignerror.html""><strong>most of what we attribute to human error is actually design error</strong></a><strong>. </strong>We blame ourselves for our mistakes when we should be blaming the systems we’re forced to work within.</p><h4>When Design Betrays You</h4><p>Stovetops are not the only place where we encounter human engineering in our daily lives. Even something as simple as a door can pose significant challenges to human-technology interaction (Yes, a door is technology). We’ve all been in that embarrassing situation where we push a door that should’ve been pulled and vice versa. But have you ever stopped to ask why you made an error? Take solace in knowing that it was the door’s fault and not your own.</p><p>These doors did you wrong. They betrayed you. They gave a signal that was incorrect, and your only fault was that you trusted them. Who knew that doors could be so deceitful? Take heart, this is a very common problem. One person who this has happened to a lot is <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/don-norman?srsltid=AfmBOop_maSfXFhLO5D93jNZZmHJpS8CVHLz0C-TGvc5aMKE9f66dhEk"">Don Norman</a>. Don knows a lot about these sorts of doors. Don has studied these doors so much that these species of doors are actually called “Norman Doors.”</p><p>In his book “<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654"">The Design of Everyday Things</a>” he explains:</p><blockquote><em>“How can such a simple thing as a door be so confusing? A door would seem to be about as simple a device as possible. There is not much you can do to a door: you can open it or shut it…The design of the door should indicate how to work it without the needs of signs or trial and error.”</em></blockquote><h4>The Principle of Discoverability</h4><p>The chief way these doors betray the user is by abandoning another fundamental and important design principle, the principle of <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/discoverability?srsltid=AfmBOoqcveYvH3s_TDQKAhmw5xqskniMY4RXp_QEpwXDtVGn9s-Pr4yW"">discoverability</a>. The principle of discoverability simply states that any designed object should make it clear to the user how to correctly use that object. In the case of the Norman door, not only did the door make it unclear, but it probably sent the exact opposite signal than what was required.</p><p>Consider a door with a horizontal push bar on it. That bar screams “PUSH ME!” to anyone who sees it. It’s a clear affordance — a visual cue about how the object should be used. Now imagine that same door with a “PULL” sign on it. The sign contradicts everything the door is telling you with its design. The horizontal bar is still there, still suggesting you should push, but now you’re supposed to ignore that signal and pull instead.</p><figure><img alt=""An example of a Norman door. A horizontal bar with a “Pull” label"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*sw9GFNd08qM_ojY8.png"" /><figcaption>A Norman Door. Source: 99percentinvisible.org</figcaption></figure><p>This is fundamentally bad design. A well-designed pull door should have a vertical handle that you can grip. A well-designed push door should have a flat plate or push bar. The design itself should communicate the proper use without requiring any labels or explanations.</p><h4>Why This Matters More Than You Think</h4><p>The Norman door is an important example of human engineering in daily life because it showcases how the alignment of human action and the environment impacts our propensity to make mistakes. If something as simple, ordinary, and untechnical as a door can impact the decisions, efficiency, and productivity of individuals than how much more will this be true for complex systems.</p><p>Indeed, the inefficiencies of these everyday objects may seem trivial and insignificant but the underlying principles they demonstrate are anything but, especially when applied to industry. What these vignettes demonstrate is important and powerful. Using the same space and the same equipment for the stove, we nearly <a href=""https://asq.org/quality-resources/mistake-proofing?srsltid=AfmBOoovPTOqO74WKlYiOk5XOyz1QlaFdxyiu7kEPCBfftUkOWoouHvx"">eliminated the possibility for error</a>. No rework, no guess and check, no errors, no need for labels, less thinking, no need to stop and think about the result of our actions and all for no money.</p><p>Human engineering is potent and powerful.</p><h4>The Core Principles of Human Engineering</h4><p>While there are many principles of human engineering, several stand out as particularly important for designing better systems:</p><p><strong>1. Spatial Compatibility:</strong> Controls should be arranged to naturally correspond with the things they control. The layout should be intuitive and obvious.</p><p><strong>2. Discoverability:</strong> The design should clearly communicate how something is meant to be used. Users shouldn’t have to guess or rely on labels and instructions.</p><p><strong>3. Feedback:</strong> The system should provide clear, immediate feedback about what’s happening. When you press a button, something should happen that confirms your action was received.</p><p><strong>4. Constraints:</strong> Good design constrains behavior in ways that prevent errors. If something can only be done one way, and that way is the correct way, errors become impossible.</p><p><strong>5. Mapping:</strong> There should be a clear relationship between controls and their effects. Natural mappings leverage existing knowledge and expectations. (I even created <a href=""http://sixsigma-consulting.com/tetris"">a fun Tetris game</a> you can to play to demonstrate this principle)</p><p><strong>6. Affordances:</strong> The design should suggest its own use. A handle affords pulling. A button affords pressing. A flat surface affords pushing.</p><h4>The Human-Centered Design Philosophy</h4><p>At its core, human engineering embodies a fundamental philosophy: when a person makes an error while using a system, it’s the system that failed, not the person. This perspective shift is revolutionary. Instead of training people harder, writing more procedures, or adding more warnings, we redesign the system so that errors become difficult or impossible to make.</p><p>This doesn’t mean humans are absolved of all responsibility. It means we recognize the reality of human limitations and capabilities, and we design accordingly. We accept that people will be distracted, tired, stressed, and forgetful. We acknowledge that people will sometimes be in a hurry, sometimes be interrupted, sometimes misremember.</p><p>Rather than fighting against human nature, human engineering works with it. Rather than demanding superhuman perfection, it creates systems where ordinary human performance is sufficient for excellent results.</p><h4>The Cognitive Load Consideration</h4><p>One of the most important benefits of good human engineering is the reduction of cognitive load. Every poorly designed interface, every ambiguous control, every unclear instruction adds to the mental burden people must carry. When you have to stop and think about which burner is which, or whether to push or pull a door, you’re <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/cognitive-load/"">using cognitive resources that could be applied elsewhere</a>.</p><p>Good design frees up mental capacity. It allows you to focus on what matters rather than wrestling with interfaces. It reduces <a href=""https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/decision-fatigue"">decision fatigue</a>. It makes the right choice the obvious choice, the easy choice, the path of least resistance.</p><p>Think about how exhausting it is to navigate a poorly designed website, a confusing form, or a cluttered workspace. Now think about how effortless it is to use a well-designed tool. That difference, that feeling of friction versus flow, is human engineering in action.</p><h4>Application Beyond Physical Objects</h4><p>While we’ve focused on physical examples like stoves and doors, human engineering principles apply to every system you interact with:</p><ul><li><strong>Digital interfaces:</strong> Are your most-used apps and tools intuitive, or do they require constant mental translation?</li><li><strong>Work processes:</strong> Do your workflows naturally guide you toward the right actions, or do they create opportunities for confusion?</li><li><strong>Personal routines:</strong> Are your habits supported by environmental design, or do they require constant willpower to maintain?</li><li><strong>Communication systems:</strong> Do your methods of staying informed and responsive flow naturally, or do they create constant friction?</li></ul><figure><img alt=""A man’s hand inserting a card into an ATM"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*mvMu1gqWP7PHccug.jpg"" /><figcaption>A pime example of good work processes, ATMs require you to take your card before your cash, making it unlikely you error (forget your card) Source: bankrate.com/</figcaption></figure><p>In each of these domains, the principles remain the same. Make the right thing easy. Make the wrong thing hard. Provide clear feedback. Create natural mappings. Reduce cognitive load.</p><h4>The Power of Environmental Design</h4><p>Human engineering reminds us that we don’t need to become better people to perform better. We need to create better systems. We don’t need more discipline, more willpower, more training. We need environments that support us rather than fight us.</p><p>This is liberating. It means improvement doesn’t require becoming someone you’re not. It requires thoughtfully designing the systems and environments you operate within. It means recognizing that when you consistently make the same “mistake,” it’s probably not your fault — it’s a design failure waiting to be fixed.</p><p>The question isn’t “How can I be more careful?” The question is “How can I redesign this system so being careful isn’t necessary?”</p><p>That’s the promise and power of human engineering.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=65e59d9ac6d8"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/human-engineering-65e59d9ac6d8"">Human engineering</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4><strong>Three stories of tools that refused to sell out</strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Middle finger coming out of a phone at a big bag of money"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dPHcRZF2WJZWuHz_Yc-ERw.png"" /><figcaption>Middle finger coming out of a phone at a big bag of money</figcaption></figure><p>Lately I’ve been writing critically about the current state of tech. So much of it feels infested with ads, deceptive design patterns or erosions of privacy all engineered to squeeze every last drop of engagement out of our already overstimulated grey matter. So as a contrast, I thought it’d be worth remembering that not all technology follows this trajectory.</p><p>At this point, many of us have grown so accustomed to terrible treatment from our tech providers that we mistake it for the natural order of things. I wrote an article last week about <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-evolution-of-youtube-how-every-platform-evolves-into-an-ad-machine-9e6032ff2d20"">YouTube’s slow shift from serving users to serving advertisers</a>, and someone commented: “Sadly, as long as the internet is largely ‘free,’ then there will always be ads. Always 🫠🫠🫠.” And while I get the feeling. Sometimes it really feels like we’re like travellers stuck in an airport terminal, forced to accept whatever fate awaits us, because there’s nowhere else to go. But there are more examples than you’d think of technology that has stayed open, portable, and most importantly put people over profit!</p><p>I’ll be sharing the stories of three of my favourites: Blender, OBS, and Penpot. One uniting thread across all these apps is these tools were built out of necessity, born from frustration, and carried forward by creators who wanted something better for <strong>themselves</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>others</strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""Blender render with logo overtop"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RDRKc_1TAwV2H_tsT5buQQ.png"" /><figcaption>Blender render with logo overtop</figcaption></figure><p>Blender, for those who don’t know, is an open-source 3D modeling and animation tool currently sitting near the tipy top of its category. It’s used by world-class VFX studios all over the world and, as of 2020, had over <a href=""https://www.blender.org/news/blender-by-the-numbers-2020/"">14 million downloads</a>, a number that continues to grow year over year. It’s an incredibly successful project and believe it or not you don’t have to pay the low-price of $12.99 a month to get a subscription to it. There’s no hidden upsell, no temporary trial access, no marketing funnel to trap you in. It is free, fully open source, and wickedly powerful.</p><p><a href=""https://www.blender.org/about/history/"">Blender was originally created in the early ’90s</a> inside a Dutch animation studio called NeoGeo. It began as an internal tool, something practical that made life easier for the artists who worked there. After the studio went belly up, Blender’s creator, Ton Roosendaal, tried to keep the project alive through a startup called Not a Number (NaN). He roped in some investors, made a splash, and then the dot-com bubble popped and evaporated the funding and stopped Blender in its tracks.</p><p>The tool was effectively locked away: trapped in the hands of investors, sitting unnoticed in a folder full of failed acquisitions gathering dust in some corporate archive alongside other abandoned experiments. That very well could’ve been the end of the story, but its creator Ton had seen the impact the tool had on the community. He knew what it meant for artists to have access to something this capable without needing to pay. So he did something wild at the time, he launched a campaign to buy Blender back from corporate limbo. Remember, this is pre kickstarter, grassroots tech funding movements weren’t all the rage. He needed 100,000 euros to reclaim the rights and release it from corporate exile.</p><p>Armed with a mailing list and a landing page he mobilized the community. Artists, hobbyists, students, tinkerers all threw a coin in the hat and in just seven weeks, he raised the entire amount. A regular ol’ Bernie-Sanders-style grassroots fundraiser. Blender was released as fully open-source software under the GNU license, and the <a href=""https://www.blender.org/about/foundation/"">Blender Foundation</a> was born, a nonprofit stewarding a public tool.</p><p>Today, Blender is funded through a donation-driven development fund supported by companies<a href=""https://fund.blender.org/""> like Ubisoft, Meta, NVIDIA</a>, and thousands of individuals who believe in its mission. It remains one of the clearest examples we have of community-driven, people first software.</p><p>Another thing I found, across all these stories is that somewhere at the centre, there’s usually a quietly stubborn technical weirdo holding the line, resisting the gravitational pull of the cash-out. That’s certainly the case with OBS. For those who aren’t familiar, OBS is best-in-class when it comes to live-streaming. If you’ve ever watched a livestream, you’ve almost certainly seen OBS in action. And the “lowly technical saint” who built it goes by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBS_Studio"">Hugh “Jim” Bailey</a>. His aim wasn’t to create the most widely used tool for streamers, it was to try and build something better for himself so he could stream <em>StarCraft II</em>… That’s it. Just a programmer trying to share a game he loved.</p><figure><img alt=""OBS interface and logo"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*HcW7fzPPxfYS1sSP"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.downloadsource.net/how-to-reset-the-obs-interface-reset-the-obs-ui/n/23048/"">OBS interface and logo</a></figcaption></figure><p>But that’s what matters, oftentimes we forget that the DNA of the people who build these tools infuses into the technology. There’s a weird Frankenstein effect when it comes to technology. In my opinion, understanding who stitched the monster together often helps you understand how a tool ends up the way it does. I find that this is perfectly illustrated by Spotify. It presents itself as a music company, but its founders <a href=""https://soundiiz.com/blog/who-are-daniel-ek-and-martin-lorentzon-spotifys-founders/""><strong>Daniel Ek</strong>, who sold his ad-tech company <strong>Advertigo</strong> to TradeDoubler, and <strong>Martin Lorentzon</strong>, the co-founder of <strong>TradeDoubler</strong>,</a> one of Europe’s largest online advertising networks. They were not record crate-diggers or historians of music. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnXwkh2Vg54"">They were ad-tech entrepreneurs looking for a scalable payload for programmatic advertising</a>, and music simply happened to be the cheapest, most convenient content vehicle. <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/spotify-has-an-ai-problem-a4d6729c715b"">Spotify is what you get when you pour ad-tech DNA into a music platform.</a></p><p><a href=""https://gamingcareers.com/podcasts/creating-obs-interview-with-jim/"">When Jim Bailey released OBS, he spent the first three years answering every forum post, every bug report, every direct message</a>. He was in the trenches with the people using his tool. He saw the struggles of beginners. He saw the streamers who depended on OBS to earn an income or build a community. And because he was so close to the people using the software, he never once saw them as assets. He saw them as peers.</p><p>So when OBS exploded in popularity and Jim started receiving acquisition offers in the <strong>seven-figure range</strong>, he didn’t acquiesce. He thought about what it means to hand his <strong>peers</strong>, millions of them, to people who probably didn’t care about them the way he did. Jim is not a public figure, so finding quotes from him is rare, but in a podcast he did with <a href=""https://gamingcareers.com/podcasts/creating-obs-interview-with-jim/"">Pete Wilkins on the <em>Gaming Careers</em> show</a>, he put it plainly in two quotes that I love:</p><blockquote><a href=""https://gamingcareers.com/podcasts/creating-obs-interview-with-jim/"">“They don’t necessarily want your program — they want the users. And it’s hard to put a price on your users like that.”</a></blockquote><p>and the succinct, but dripping with his ethos:</p><blockquote><a href=""https://gamingcareers.com/podcasts/creating-obs-interview-with-jim/"">“I don’t need a yacht.”</a></blockquote><p>This was clearly not a financially “smart” move. Today, OBS is maintained by a tiny core team and a smattering of volunteer contributors. OBS remained open not because it was easy, but because its creator refused to sell the people who depended on it.</p><p>The last example I want to touch should be near and dear to the heart of every product designer. <a href=""https://penpot.app/"">Penpot</a>! Penpot was created by a company called Kaleidos, a decade-old studio that originally operated as a kind of elite technical/research partner for hire. Their full name <em>Kaleidos Open Source</em> reflected a very real internal philosophy: they only used open-source tools, they built for their clients using open-source tools, and they carved out protected time to create their own open software.</p><figure><img alt=""Penpot logo surrounded by UI graphics"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/690/0*UIB6QyIvTW2q5snR.jpeg"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://community.penpot.app/t/its-time-for-penpot-to-almost-move-away-from-the-dom/6437"">Penpot logo surrounded by UI graphics</a></figcaption></figure><p>For years, Kaleidos was a developer-centric team. They outsourced most of the design work, and that worked fine, until one day they had to hire their first internal designers. That’s when their philosophy came face to face with reality. While developers frolic in an open-source oasis, designers were stuck with a collection of janky, slow, unpolished tools that barely, and I mean <strong>barely</strong> met professional standards. The truth was the design team simply didn’t have open-source equivalents of the quality that developers took for granted. So while the designers loved the ethos, the tools just weren’t good enough and they needed Figma. So Kaleidos conceded. They broke their own rule. But they broke it with a single condition:</p><blockquote><a href=""https://possiblefutures.tech/posts/interview-with-penpot-ceo-pablo-ruiz-muzquiz-on-open-source-design-and-ethical-funding"">“We’ll use Figma… but while we use it, we’ll build the Figma killer.” Pablo Ruiz-Múzquiz</a>, founder of Penpot &amp; Kaleidos</blockquote><p>And that is how <a href=""https://possiblefutures.tech/posts/interview-with-penpot-ceo-pablo-ruiz-muzquiz-on-open-source-design-and-ethical-funding"">Penpot was born</a>! Early versions were rough, but Penpot has come a long way in just a few years. And since its release in February of 2021, Kaleidos fully committed to just working on their own tools and shut down their client-services business entirely!</p><p>They call themselves the Figma Killer because they’re an ambition team. Though maybe not the ambition we think of when we picture ambitious people. Not the Machiavellian business man dressed to the nines, stepping out of some expensive sports car working their way up a corporate ladder to give an inspiring talk at some conference full of suits. This is a different ambition, a moral ambition, which drives companies like Kaleidos to build products that put the power of tools into people’s hands. It’s hard to imagine being in a position of building a tool that you put blood sweat and tears into and not wanting the greatest remuneration possible, but the reason that all three of these founders are able to do it is because their ambition isn’t monetary, it’s about <strong>impact</strong>. They want people to feel like they have autonomy and are empowered.</p><p>When you step back from these stories: Blender, OBS, Penpot all show a pattern. They didn’t become popular because of market positioning or manipulative growth and monetization strategies. They became what they are because the people behind them had values that were strong enough to resist selling out their users.</p><p>Each of these tools carries the fingerprint of its creator’s worldview. Software is not neutral. It inherits the values of the people who make it. We treat platform decay as inevitable. But I think that inevitability story favours the people making the choice of profit over people.</p><p>And that’s why these three examples matter so much. They remind us that it is still possible, even now, even in this tech climate to build software rooted in generosity, openness, and respect. To build tools that don’t treat users like resources to mine and exist because someone cared more about enabling others rather than maximizing returns. We need more of that kind of ambition.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3985d97f3b23"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/when-software-has-integrity-3985d97f3b23"">When software has integrity</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Great ideas arrive on their own time. The design stroll is an easy framework for capturing them when they do.</h4><figure><img alt=""Two cartoon diamonds walking down a street holding hands"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GSQ6tkvnHslyZNmIzCGbSQ.png"" /><figcaption>Illustration by Liam Oscar Thurston</figcaption></figure><p>Through all the changes I’ve seen in design throughout my career, there has been one constant: Everyone always wants you to go faster. To (maybe) quote Benjamin Franklin, “time is money”. A lot of designers are happy to trot out the old “<a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/the-big-lie-of-good-fast-cheap-fb8905818250"">Good/Fast/Cheap: Choose 2</a>” diagram, bitterly complaining that no one ultimately picks “good” among the options. But failing to keep up is an existential threat. If you can’t design in time, then it’ll be an engineer, or a VP, or an AI agent that will.</p><figure><img alt=""A Venn diagram showing the overlap between good, fast, and cheap"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/1*AzquVdt_kEV2er75dKFjwg.png"" /><figcaption>I made this diagram quickly and cheaply. As a result, it kind of sucks.</figcaption></figure><p>As someone who reacts viscerally to bad design, I tend to lean a tad towards stubborn when it comes to quality. This means I spend altogether too much time thinking about ways to do design, at quality, quickly. It’s part of the reason <a href=""https://medium.com/loblaw-digital/designing-a-design-system-for-loblaw-digital-a-magical-mystery-tour-37d0b9764601"">I like design systems so much</a>. And while I’m the first person to raise an eyebrow at the latest productivity/ creativity/ diet/ life-hack, I’ve come to recognize something about how I work, and how I assume others do too. I’ve found that my next great idea has rarely arrived on time, or on theme, or during set “creative” opportunities. Instead, they’ve come when I’m knee deep in the work, inside those fabled flow states people talk about where you can “see the matrix” or whatever.</p><p>Being in that state, and having the idea, only to just shrug it off seemed ultimately annoying, and it got me thinking about how it might be possible to pause for a moment, and actually chase that idea down. How would you capture it, and manage your commitments? What steps would you take? Taking a page from Albert Hofmann, I decided to experiment on myself, and ran my very own personal “design stroll”, a playbook for designers to switch gears when the metaphorical lightbulb switched on. In the wake of some success, and a real sense of motivation, I sought to formalize the process, and in doing so I learned about exactly why I found it to be so effective.</p><p>It’s occurred to me that inside of every company, there’s probably someone with a great idea, just sitting on it, for lack of time, motivation, or really anything else. They’re the people who understand the problem best, but maybe they’ve never had the chance (or the permission) to solve it.</p><p>So if you’re a leader, a designer, or a leader of designers, this is my gift to you. The <em>design stroll</em> is a way to catch those great ideas, when they come, still keep your teams going, and motivate your best minds to keep bringing their best to the table. No need to thank me. Just mail me a cheque for 10%.</p><h3>Born to… stroll?</h3><p>The design world already has its go-to go-fast technique, the <a href=""https://www.thesprintbook.com/the-design-sprint""><em>design sprint</em></a>. It’s a 5-day, all-in workshop that pulls the best ideas a team has, focuses on one good one, and works to produce an artefact that can be tested with users by the sprint’s end. When done right, design sprints are an effective way to solve or ideate around a big decision, or even a new product.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*idYxgMivtwIC48RV1n1BSw.png"" /><figcaption>The Design Sprint, from <a href=""https://www.thesprintbook.com/the-design-sprint"">TheSprintBook.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>Design sprints themselves are carefully designed, building on the principles set out by <a href=""https://designthinking.ideo.com/"">IDEO’s “Design Thinking” process</a>. Significant effort by the architects of the sprint went to mitigating specific drawbacks of open-room brainstorming. Namely, that collective workshops suffer from groupthink, bias consensus, and give preference to the ideas of the most senior person in the room (conspicuously it’s not shocking that leaders like doing them). So the design sprint carves out time for individual ideation, anonymizes voting up ideas, and attempts to put everyone on the same page at the start, something Knapp et al call a “beginner’s mindset”.</p><p>But good intentions often suffer from bad practices. In reality, teams aren’t truly afforded the entire time free from commitments, so people drop in and out, often leaving specific team members with the required expertise (designers and or engineers) to manifest and test the artefacts. Success in articulating and defending ideas still hinge on your communication skills, likability, and role in the organization, and since “beginners” lack the nuance inherent in the problems you’re solving, they tend to favour ambitious solutions that an expert would disregard based on a deeper understanding (this is called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect"">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>, where non-experts tend to rate their expertise as greater than the experts rank themselves, ie: you don’t know what you don’t know).</p><p>Did your sprint come up with an app that would do everything? That means you’ve failed. This was just a team building exercise. <strong>If the design process could operate this quickly, wouldn’t we just sprint all the time?</strong></p><figure><img alt=""A still from the simpsons episode featuring Homer inside the car he designed"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/495/1*J4Z5vva4aMCeFdyxLRRpbw.png"" /><figcaption>The outcome of too many design sprints looks like “the Homer” (Copyright FOX)</figcaption></figure><p>By contrast the d<em>esign stroll</em> (a play on design sprint, if that was not abundantly clear) goes all in on two things; <strong>individual effort</strong>, and <strong>expertise</strong>. A <em>design stroll</em> is conducted by a single expert, and realizes an idea or solution from a single perspective. No compromises. That idea gets a shot at being fully expressed before the weight of the group comes to bear. The designer/solver gets their chance at being an auteur. What’s your <em>Citizen Kane</em>?</p><h3>Stroll this way:</h3><p>You can break the whole process down into a few phases;</p><p>1 Business as usual<br />2. The Lightbulb Moment<br />3. Making it real|<br />4. Show n’ Tell</p><p><strong>Business as usual<br /></strong>Imagine that you’re a designer*, working on any given product, knocking things off a prioritized roadmap, doing your best to meld business needs with customer wants. You spend your days thinking about that product, and you understand it really well. Inevitably, (and maybe regrettably) you find that those thoughts aren’t confined to the 9–5. Your brain’s still working in the background when you’re on transit, grocery shopping, lying in bed at night.</p><p><strong>The Lightbulb Moment</strong><br />Pablo Picasso once said “Inspiration does exist, but it must find you working”. And so here, in the midst of your work, something will inevitably happen. You’ll have an idea. Maybe it’s a solution to a specific problem you’re facing, but it could also be an approach, enhancement, or even something that’s on the periphery of the work you do. It’s up to you to determine whether that idea’s worth pursuing. The best ideas for strolls are what you might call “inside the box” thinking. That doesn’t mean they’re boring, just that they’re constrained. It’s probably not the way to go about re-imagining fundamental value propositions, or blocking out the chapters for your first novel. The best strolls ideas are “what-if” moments that could actually happen.</p><p><strong>Making it Real<br /></strong>Instead of putting this idea into a Notes page you’ll only dig up when you’re trying to think of the name of that restaurant where you had that parmesan ice cream sandwich that one time, you’re going to want to prove out your idea. You might not even know fully how you’ll bring it to life just yet, or all the edge cases that might present themselves, but you won’t know until you try. Herein is the hardest part of the entire <em>design stroll</em>– taking the time needed to flesh out your idea. More on this later.</p><p>You shouldn’t attempt anything you can’t bring to life in a few days. Remember that you’re proving the concept, not shipping it. You’re also working from your lone perspective, the director of your own little film. That doesn’t mean you can’t engage a colleague who’s an ace at prototyping, or a copywriting superstar to help you deliver the best version.</p><p>Your output could be a prototype, a vibe-coded demo, or even a well-structured storyboard. You’re bringing your idea to life so that others can understand it, and that’s really all that’s important.</p><p><strong>Show n’ Tell</strong><br />By now you’ve created something that does the job of demonstrating the general sense of your idea. Now it’s time to get it out into the world. You’ll have to show people not only how it works, but what value it has. A design crit is a great place to start. If the signals are good, find ways to socialize this with your cross functional partners. Get some feedback. Maybe hold off on emailing it to the CEO. The point of the work you’ve done is to start a conversation.</p><p><em>*really you don’t have to be a designer to do this, just anyone deeply involved and invested in your work.</em></p><h3>The Man who Strolled the World</h3><p>If you’re skeptical, you’re paying attention. Not everyone has the luxury of just stopping their work to chase down an idea. Before you go anywhere, you need permission. Timing’s important. So is managing your workload. It’s important to communicate. A stroll conversation should work like this:</p><p><em>Hey ______, I’ve got a great idea to _________________. Can I spend a few days putting something together to show you what I mean? (Then explain the design stroll, or link them to this article.)</em></p><p>That’s essentially how I pitched my very first “stroll” to my design leader at the time. I’d had a revelation about how we might allow our customers to both perceive and obtain value across our e-commerce platforms. Normally this is an idea I’d just shelve and grumble about, but not this time. Across a span of about four days I put my head down, declined any meetings I could, and put together a demo. I didn’t do it alone. I reviewed it with a skilled visual designer, I conscripted another– a prototyping ace– to help me bring things up to a very narrow, polished expression of my solution. I worked through a few takes of a video walkthrough (one which was going perfectly until the fire alarm went off). I sent the video around to a few sympathetic peers, and then sent it up the chain.</p><figure><img alt=""Two screens from an ecommerce app that show how to complete deals in cart"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jSq9OfmieSDZeF9q1IOxuw.png"" /><figcaption>One of a number of screens I produced in my “value vision” stroll. (Copyright Loblaw)</figcaption></figure><p>To be clear, it’s not like the business hit the emergency stop and pivoted to action on my idea. Nor did I expect it to. What it did do was frame important conversations about value initiatives for the year ahead, and helped to illustrate some important ideas and considerations so folks across functions could align. A few quarters have passed, and pulling things from my initial stroll concepts into my work. Better yet, I’m seeing the work referenced by other folks in the organization to bring planning documents to life.</p><h3>Stroll Lotta Love</h3><p>There are a number of real reasons why I think the <em>design stroll</em> is an effective tool. To explore why, you need to know a little bit about how good ideas form.</p><p>It was Thomas Edison who supposedly said “great ideas originate in the muscles”. With 1093 US patents to his name, Edison isn’t some gilded-age Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson. He means that good ideas come from doing, and not from passively being struck with inspiration. The mental image of someone deep in thought being struck by inspiration, doesn’t really happen. This is the <em>design stroll’</em>s environment, in the muscles, waist deep in doing. That’s where ideas are found.</p><p>In his not-subtly named book, <a href=""https://stevenberlinjohnson.com/where-good-ideas-come-from-763bb8957069""><em>Where good ideas come from</em></a>, Steven Johnson talks about the concept of the “long hunch”, where a vague idea about something slowly forms in someone’s mind over an extended period of time. Eventually through exposure to the problem itself, or the thoughts of others, those hunches combine into a great idea. For Johnson,</p><blockquote>“Sustaining the slow hunch is less a matter of perspiration than of cultivation. You give the hunch enough nourishment to keep it growing, and plant it in fertile soil, where its roots can make new connections. And then you give it time to bloom.”(78)</blockquote><p>Long hunches feed the <em>design stroll</em>. On the occasion when one hunch crashes into another and makes a good idea, it’s time for the <em>design stroll</em> to begin.</p><p>For Daniel Kahneman, author of <a href=""https://dn790002.ca.archive.org/0/items/DanielKahnemanThinkingFastAndSlow/Daniel%20Kahneman-Thinking%2C%20Fast%20and%20Slow%20%20.pdf""><em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em></a>, there are two (metaphorical) systems of thinking. System 1, which is automatic and intuitive, and System 2, which is more effortful and logical. When it comes to ideation, the two systems interact, taking System 1’s creative “aha” moments and putting them into practice in practical ways with System 2. Kahneman also stresses that System 1 thinking often relies on bias, and that fundamentally humans aren’t very good at being right when it comes to intuitive guesses, because we’re so easily swayed by things around us. Fast thinking (System 1) makes it easy for someone to focus on the wrong thing, with Kahneman suggesting that “when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution”. (12)</p><p>Here’s where the stroll shines. A stroll lets you wait for the right time to take action. We’ve all been in a situation where we’ve been presented with a problem, and without much thinking, answered it, only to have our response quickly put on the scrap heap. “Yeah. We tried that, and no.” That was your overconfident System 1 talking. The <em>design stroll</em> gives System 1 and 2 time to battle it out, and that means that the solution is much higher quality than the one you’d have if you’d been thrown onto a team during a hackathon, etc.</p><p>Even the creators of the sprint, Jake Knapp &amp; co. acknowledge the facts. In contemplating why (pre-sprint) brainstorming sessions weren’t working, they write:</p><blockquote>“Individuals were still thinking up ideas the same ways they always had– while sitting at their desks, or waiting at a coffee shop, or taking a shower. Those individual ideas were better.” (Sprint, 2)</blockquote><p>The stroll is centred around individual contribution, and it puts individual perspectives to the test before they get shot down. How many times have you had an idea that you just couldn’t communicate well enough to show folks the bigger picture? The stroll is laser-focused on cultivating these ideas so they aren’t lost, missed, or ignored.</p><h3>Stroll with it</h3><p>If you’re a design leader, or really anyone with any influence on process, you’d do well to carve out time for your experts to pounce on an idea when they have it. Someone on your team or in your organization probably has an amazing, well-thought out, money-making/saving, feasible idea that you haven’t heard about. Maybe because you haven’t asked. Make the time and space for ideas to be developed when they strike, and never let another good idea go unspoken again. Not every stroll will be the next big idea. <strong>Some might be small good ones.</strong></p><p>Implementing strolls in your practice is really about making space in two ways, granting permission, and providing a forum to socialize what gets produced. Designers need to know that they can take time to explore solutions that aren’t on a roadmap. They need trust in the use of the time, and their teams need to make space to enable them, or even assist them if they need it. A good idea no one sees is about as loud as a tree falling in the forest with no one around. It’s important to create forums for stroll ideas to be both heard and understood, by those who can facilitate bringing them to life.</p><p>In the absolute worst case, you’ve lost a few productive hours and energized your team creatively. Giving permission to ideate outside of the confines of work, and listening –if nothing else–provides motivation and a sense of meaning in one’s work (in case you haven’t heard, there’s a bit of a <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/a-crisis-of-meaning-in-ux-design-0831b85a3fb5"">crisis of meaning in design at the moment</a>). Better motivation, better satisfaction, better productivity. It’s a win-win-win. So If you want to find good ideas, find those who are in the work, and when solutions come, let them out for a stroll.</p><p><em>Thanks for reading.

<h4><strong>How to build empathy with users you struggle to understand</strong></h4><figure><img alt=""A lemon speaks to a snake that it is wound up in and the snake looks at the lemon, then looks away, creating a loop."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xMlACuDGr6GAcynCT1JS5Q.gif"" /></figure><p>The digital nomad who is designing an app for the atomic midwestern family. The non-gamer who is designing a videogame UI. The sighted person who is building a touch interface for the blind.</p><p>Empathy is foundational to product design. We talk about it constantly: cultivating it, mapping it, building with it. But what happens when empathy doesn’t come naturally? What do we do when we don’t relate to our users, when their behaviors feel foreign or even frustrating?</p><p>I ran into this problem recently while designing a fitness app. I was stuck until I remembered the first time I’d overcome it: writing dialogue for a cartoon snake, of all things.</p><h4><strong>The Snake in the Room</strong></h4><p>In 2012, I joined Nickelodeon’s new flagship show Sanjay and Craig as a storyboard director. It was a catch-all role: writing, storyboarding, shaping jokes and characters. The premise? A boy and his talking pet snake. The tone? Wild, absurd, full of bodily functions. If you watched kids’ TV back then, you might remember it.</p><p>As we started breaking episodes, I hit a wall. Craig Slithers, the talking snake, was one of the main characters <em>and I couldn’t write him</em>. I just didn’t understand who he was.</p><p>Craig was bold, brash, and loved the spotlight. I was second-guessing myself after a rough project before Nick, trying to quietly get back on my feet. He was all noise and confidence. I, though gregarious, was trying not to get noticed.</p><p>Still, I had to write for him. I needed to understand his mindset, his instincts, his voice.</p><p>I tried outlining his traits. Rereading scripts. Mapping his arc. None of it helped. He felt flat, fake.</p><p>Eventually, I gave myself one small challenge: <strong>find one thing I had in common with him.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""A snake chases it‘s own tail, trying to reach just one connection."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*h3Zok9vKHMsShEqCWMSHdg.gif"" /><figcaption>Though it can feel like this sometimes.</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>A Moment of Product Design Clarity in a Writers’ Room</strong></h4><p>I landed on this line in a script: “Craig was cool. Or, really, he wasn’t, but he believed he was cool.”</p><p>That clicked.</p><p>Not because it was funny. Because I’d been there.</p><p>At different points in my life, I’ve pretended to be cooler, more confident, more capable than I really felt. That little overlap, just a sliver (or slither) of shared emotion, was enough to get me started. Suddenly, I could write Craig. Not because I “got” him completely, but because I understood one emotional truth. From that truth, I could build. I had my “in”.</p><p>This “in” was my opportunity to immerse myself in the user and their needs like how <a href=""https://www.ideo.org/perspective/radical-immersion-for-extreme-empathy"">Julia Benini wrote in her article on IDEO</a>. The process I’d stumbled into is exactly what product designers do every day: observation, questioning assumptions, finding emotional truth, just with real people instead of cartoon ones.</p><h4><strong>Finding Your “In”</strong></h4><p>In UX design, we sometimes treat empathy like a light switch. Either it’s there or it’s not. But real empathy comes in layers. You don’t need to fully understand someone’s life to connect with them, maybe you just need to connect with one emotional truth. An “in”.</p><figure><img alt=""A series of colorful images of the word “in”. This is meant to represent the different ways you might find a connection with you user."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uBxHOH-63utQWxnositdUw.gif"" /></figure><p>That “in” usually comes from research: interviews, fieldwork, usability tests. But even with great data, it can be hard to relate. When users act in ways we don’t expect, we get frustrated. We think they’re confused, irrational, maybe just wrong.</p><p>But they’re not. They’re just not us.</p><p>Instead of asking, “Why are they doing that?” ask, “What truth might explain this?” I didn’t relate to Craig’s confidence. But I did relate to the desire behind it. That was the crack in the door I needed.</p><h4><strong>Staying Curious</strong></h4><p>When you don’t relate to a character or a user, it’s easy to reduce them to a stereotype. Early on, I thought Craig was just chaos. Loud, pushy, needy. But the more I asked questions (what’s he hiding? what’s he afraid of?), the more I started to see the human side underneath the gags. That shift changed how I wrote him. Suddenly he wasn’t just loud. He was trying to seem loud, to cover something up. That made him real.</p><p>Users can be the same. When someone skips onboarding or drops out halfway through a task, it’s tempting to write them off. But those behaviors often come from something relatable: fear, frustration, stress, distraction.</p><p>While designing a fitness app for finding nearby workouts (a freelance project that has yet to see the light of day), I hit my own empathy wall. As someone who prefers solo training and finds social fitness apps like Strava intrusive, I assumed our users would want a clean, private experience focused purely on location and workout type. I designed around that assumption by emphasizing map views and filtering options while intentionally avoiding any social features.</p><p>But user interviews told a completely different story. People didn’t just want to find nearby running trails or hiking spots, they wanted recommendations from people they trusted.</p><p>One user told me -</p><figure><img alt=""An image of a word bubble that reads “I’d rather run a mediocre route that my friend loved than discover the perfect trail alone.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RKBKUcMoPjK2o2bOgm1xfQ.gif"" /></figure><p>There was my in. Instead of seeing social features as noise, they saw them as the most reliable filter for quality recommendations from people they trusted.</p><p>That feedback forced me to view my product from a different angle. Instead of building another map-based discovery tool, we pivoted to focus on trusted recommendations from your network. The core insight wasn’t about finding workouts nearby, it was about finding workouts that people like you had actually enjoyed. We redesigned the entire experience around a “recommended by people you know” social feed that surfaced workouts based on your connections’ activities and ratings.</p><p>Good product design comes from staying curious. Instead of fixing users, we ask what matters to them at the moment. We don’t design for quirks. We design for people. And when you find your “in” to empathize with those people, then you can find the best solution.</p><h4><strong>The Emotion(al) Moment</strong></h4><figure><img alt=""An animated illustration of a snake eating a lemon."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zP8NhzbtO-mmqhgkbrX4LQ.gif"" /></figure><p>In creative writing, “voice” isn’t just how a character talks. It’s how they see the world. That lens makes them feel real.</p><p>In product design, we tend to focus on goals and tasks. But great design also reflects how users feel in the very moment they engage with a product.</p><p>Did they miss their coffee? Are they exhausted from their newborn baby? What were they hoping for, and is the product delivering that?</p><p>Users don’t come to our products as blank slates. They bring their full emotional lives with them: stress, distraction, hope, exhaustion. When we find our “in” to that emotional reality, we can design for their actual headspace, not an idealized version of it.</p><p>Empathy should show up in every interaction, not just the text.</p><h4><strong>From Snake Scripts to Product Design Sprints</strong></h4><p><a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/i-make-the-lemonade-3a8070ee9bbd"">As I have previously mentioned</a>, my past experience as a storyteller in animation has shaped some of my UX philosophy. Writing Craig taught me how to understand someone I didn’t instinctively relate to. It forced me to find connection through questions, observation, and emotion.</p><p>This process made the leap with me to product design and it’s what helped draw me into this new path. In animation, you’re constantly thinking about audience engagement: what makes them laugh, when they’ll lose interest, how to keep them watching. I realized that product design is essentially the same thing, but instead of just entertaining an audience and keeping their eyeballs on your product, you’re helping users accomplish real goals that matter to their daily lives and keeping them engaged. Both require understanding psychology and designing experiences that feel intuitive and satisfying, but product design offered something animation couldn’t: the opportunity to make people’s lives genuinely easier, not just more entertaining.</p><p>To accomplish this we don’t have to become our users. We just have to stay open. Curious. Patient. Willing to look past the surface.
