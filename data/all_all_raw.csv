<p>Grid Arthub is located in Hall 31B, a late 19th-century industrial building in the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/gdansk"">Gdańsk</a> Shipyard, a site historically associated with both shipbuilding and the Solidarity movement. The project began with an intention to preserve the hall's layered identity while introducing a flexible contemporary program that could support the growing creative sector in Gdańsk. The inspiration came from the building's long and changing history. Over time, it served as a wood-drying plant, mess hall, boxing gym, and office space. Rather than erasing these traces, the design sought to work with them, maintaining a sense of continuity while opening the interior to new uses.</p>",

Following the creation of Restaurant ÄNG and the lakeside retreat of Sjöparken, this new project extends the dialogue between architecture and terrain, deepening the sensorial experience that has come to define the vineyard's growing constellation of spaces and functions.</p>",

<h4>From chat to canvas to control panel: Understanding natural language interaction patterns</h4><figure><img alt=""Soft, misty background with a blurred human face profile on the right and the heading “Natural Language Interaction Patterns” on the left, accompanied by pill-shaped labels reading Intent, Action, and Orchestration."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GNkosiM1Eioj63cPsN-qMg.png"" /></figure><p>For much of the history of software, users had to build a mental model of the system before they could use it effectively. You learned where things lived like which menu contained which action, which screen held which information, how different parts of the interface connected to each other.</p><p>Interaction followed a structured pattern: navigate screens by clicking buttons, type into fields, scroll through content, use gestures, menus, or keyboard shortcuts to move between states. Every action required first understanding the system’s organizational logic, then locating the right control, and finally performing the correct interaction on it. Users translated what they wanted into a series of UI interactions the system understood.</p><p>While <em>affordance</em> was explicit, <em>intent</em> was indirect.</p><h3>When systems begin to understand intent</h3><p>As natural language based interaction to machine evolves, they didn’t just change how we express intent, they fundamentally compress entire workflows into single expressions.</p><p>For instance, Google search transformed how we find information precisely because it eliminated the directory-browsing model of early web portals.</p><figure><img alt=""Image comparing two navigation approaches. At the top, a hierarchical categories flow shows stacked panels moving left to right: Technology → Software → Operating System → Linux, with each selection highlighted in blue and arrows indicating deeper navigation. At the bottom, a single search bar labeled “Direct Natural Language Search” shows the query “latest news on linux OS,” illustrating direct access without navigating categories."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4CH_JqrSYUIkVUtYkLu8DQ.png"" /></figure><p>The system becomes responsible for translating that intent into the underlying sequence of actions, queries, and transformations.</p><p>This transformation fundamentally changes the contract between user and tool. Traditional interfaces required users to learn the system’s language, its navigation patterns, its terminology, its organizational logic. Natural language interfaces require the system to learn the user’s language instead.</p><h4>The Agent Shift: From understanding intent to executing work</h4><p>Modern AI interfaces extend this principle even further. Where Google compressed <em>navigation</em>, AI systems compress <em>action</em>, as Ben Shneiderman explores in his work on <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3419764"">bridging the gap between ethics and practice in human-centered AI</a>.</p><p>Plus, typing into a message box in natural language to converse with a system is straightforward, much like sending a text message. This familiarity lowers the entry barrier dramatically, making powerful AI tools immediately accessible to non-experts. And made tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Microsoft Copilot etc achieved mainstream adoption with remarkable speed.</p><h4>The conversation feed overload problem</h4><p>These conversation feed-based AI tools excel at expressing intent and getting relatively straightforward answers with better multi-turn controls. But the conversation feed can become overloaded when tasks involve multiple subsequent actions, require human intervention at various steps, or produce persistent artifacts that need to remain visible or outcomes become duplicative and longer. The linear nature of conversation thread often struggles to accommodate these complexities.</p><figure><img alt=""Animated GIF showing a user scrolling through a ChatGPT conversation feed in dark mode, revealing structured sections with headings, bullet points, and to convey longer message chains."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0vGE_GTPNE1cECtP1Y2xNw.gif"" /></figure><p>Different tools are responding to this tension:</p><ul><li>Some keep everything in the chat thread, treating code and documents as just another message</li><li>Others split the experience entirely, placing all output in a dedicated canvas</li><li>A few blend both approaches, using conversation for steering while the canvas holds the work</li></ul><p>This question of AI placement in UI design, which Sharang Sharma explored in his <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/where-should-ai-sit-in-your-ui-1710a258390e"">article</a>, becomes increasingly critical as these tools mature. The rest of this article covers observations from industry AI tools using different natural language-based interaction patterns, how they align with key aspects of interaction elements, and what we can learn if we want to build natural language-driven features, products, or systems.</p><h3>Natural language as an interaction medium</h3><p>When examining natural language interfaces through the lens of interaction design, Don Norman’s concept of the <a href=""https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262525671/the-design-of-everyday-things/"">Gulf of Execution and Gulf of Evaluation</a> provides a powerful framework for understanding how interaction loop with natural language work in these tools.</p><p><em>The Gulf of Execution</em> represents the gap between what a user intends to do and the actions required to execute it in the interface.</p><p><em>The Gulf of Evaluation </em>represents the gap between what the system does and the user’s understanding of that outcome.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram illustrating Norman’s action cycle with two loops. From “User Goal,” the top execution path flows through Identify Intention → Identify Actions → Execute in Interface → Interface. The bottom evaluation path flows from Interface Output → Interpretation → Evaluation back to User Goal, labeled as the Gulf of Execution (top) and Gulf of Evaluation (bottom)."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jK0bzL1YdrRarBHK55o7nA.png"" /></figure><p>For natural language driven interaction, instead of manually identifying and executing interface actions, users express intent directly through language. The system handles the translation from intention to action to execution. Instead of piecing together what happened from interface changes, users receive feedback in natural language, visual outputs, or a combination of both, making interpretation and evaluation more direct.</p><p>However, the effectiveness of this approach depends on how the interface distributes these interactions across different spaces.</p><p>Across existing tools that I’ve come across, I notice several patterns in how natural language bridges these gulfs. I’ve summarized three of them based on where execution happens and where evaluation takes place.</p><h4><strong>Pattern 1: Natural language interface as primary workspace</strong></h4><p>This pattern makes the <em>conversation itself the main workspace</em>, where the user expresses intent entirely in natural language and the system generates outputs in the same thread. It treats the chat as the central place for input, execution, and results along with persistent message history.</p><figure><img alt=""Four-panel comparison of AI assistant interfaces displayed in a grid, each showing long-form, structured responses in dark mode, including bullet points, headings, tables, and search-based results. Order of tools (top left to bottom right): ChatGPT, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8tCUXqcI03M3zRrcAYIrpQ.png"" /><figcaption>Side-by-side view of AI assistants: <a href=""https://chatgpt.com/"">ChatGPT</a>, <a href=""https://gemini.google.com/app"">Gemini</a>, <a href=""https://copilot.microsoft.com/"">Microsoft Copilot</a>, and <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/"">Perplexity</a></figcaption></figure><p>Both gulfs are bridged entirely within the same conversational space. You express what you want in the chat, the system executes, and you evaluate the results all in the same thread. The entire interaction loop lives in the conversation. Your journey can end there, or you move forward into a different tool to continue the work.</p><p><strong><em>Things to be aware of</em>: </strong>Users can express broad intent easily, but they have <em>limited fine-grained control</em> over how outputs are produced, and refining results still relies on more natural language rather than precise edits. Also Piras documents <a href=""https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/02/designing-ai-beyond-conversational-interfaces/"">how conversational interfaces, while seemingly intuitive, introduce usability challenges</a> designers solved decades ago in GUI design. The “blank page problem” remains acute: users often don’t know what to type to get ideal output, and the burden of articulating intent shifts entirely to the user.</p><h4><strong>Pattern 2: Natural language interface as contextual action block</strong></h4><p>Contextual input area, not a full chat interface. A natural language input component appears near your selection or as a menu option</p><figure><img alt=""Four-panel grid showing AI-assisted creation across different tools: Figma with an “Describe your edit” prompt, Notion with inline AI writing suggestions, Photoshop with a generative image fill prompt over a blurred image, and Wispr Flow displaying voice dictation converting speech into text."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*64GJWusQ_N1eIgdBjb3aXw.png"" /><figcaption>AI-assisted workflows across <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7373707174193156096/"">Figma</a>, <a href=""https://www.notion.com/help/guides/notion-ai-for-docs"">Notion</a>, <a href=""https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/generative-fill.html"">Photoshop</a>, and <a href=""https://wisprflow.ai/"">Wispr Flow</a></figcaption></figure><p>Gulf of execution happens through language interface, but gulf of evaluation happens visually on the canvas. There’s typically no conversation history in this space (can be stored and displayed in different interface seciton), each prompt is a fresh, contextual interaction. The canvas remains the primary work surface; natural language is just another input method within your existing workflow. This pattern often references context implicitly, bundling related information into single commands which Tang terms “<a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/emerging-interaction-patterns-in-generative-ai-experiences-8c351bb3392a"">context bundling</a>” to reduce typing burden while preserving</p><p><strong><em>Things to be aware of</em>: </strong>Pattern 2 treats each language prompt as a discrete action command tied to the workspace . For example, “summarize this selection” or “generate chart from this table”. This mean the pattern often reference context implicitly. it often struggles to integrate rich external context (like files, multiple references, or tool chains) and doesn’t naturally support deep follow-up refinement through language alone.</p><h4>Pattern 3: Natural language interface as control panel</h4><p>Having a persistent conversational panel alongside a workspace helps with iterative refinement and visibility of results. This dedicated chat composer provides a full, persistent conversational interface with message history. The system interprets the request, plans a sequence of actions from the converstation panel and executes them in a separate workspace</p><figure><img alt=""Four-panel screenshot showing an AI-assisted development workflow: Cursor AI editing a React/TypeScript codebase with inline suggestions, and OpenAI ChatGPT Atlas in agent mode executing tasks"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aA7XTemjn2iJ5Hzlw80cHg.png"" /><figcaption>Agent-driven workflows using <a href=""https://cursor.com/agents"">Cursor AI </a>and OpenAI <a href=""https://chatgpt.com/atlas/"">ChatGPT Atlas</a></figcaption></figure><p>Gulf of execution and gulf of evaluation are bridged across separate spaces. You execute through conversation in one space, but you evaluate by watching both the external workspace and reading feedback in the chat. This creates a supervisory relationship where the natural language interface is your control mechanism while work happens elsewhere. Users must monitor both spaces to fully understand what happened. Design principle from <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/ai-ux-design-for-intelligent-interfaces-bc966e96107d"">article written by Basu</a> emphasize how to provide clear indicators of what the agent is doing in the background, so users feel in control even when the system is proactive. Interpretation requires synthesizing information from the workspace (seeing what changed) and the chat (reading what the system did and why). The control panel enables iteration that you can refine, redirect, or build on previous turns while the agent continues working.</p><p>Agent Advancements like Anthropic’s <a href=""https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use"">Computer Use</a>, OpenAI’s <a href=""https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/"">Operator</a>, Google’s <a href=""https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-computer-use-model/"">Computer Space</a>, operates an entire computer or browser interface while you supervise from the chat panel. You provide high-level instructions (“book a restaurant reservation for Friday”), and the agent navigates websites, fills forms, and completes multi-step tasks. As these agents become more autonomous, the tension between letting them work and maintaining meaningful control becomes more acute, echoing the classic debate between direct manipulation and interface agents that <a href=""https://pienso.com/blog/direct-manipulation-vs-interface-agents-revisiting-the-classic-debate-decades-later"">Pienso</a> revisited in their 2024 analysis.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram comparing three natural language interface patterns. Pattern 1 shows a single full-screen conversation area. Pattern 2 displays a canvas with a contextual input field and separate workspace. Pattern 3 illustrates a split view with a chat panel on the right and workspace on the left"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5W0gVWTy1weWjKlAYZvXBg.png"" /></figure><p>Interaction loop can be summarized as follows:</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/dc5ca7d1bc382799e7d95e1b194822c9/href"">https://medium.com/media/dc5ca7d1bc382799e7d95e1b194822c9/href</a><p>While the three patterns above represent the primary ways natural language functions as an active interaction medium, two other common approaches exist but fall outside this framework. <em>Dedicated intent capture pages</em> like homepage or AI tool template galleries serve as short-lived entry points that help users articulate what they want before routing them to one of the three core patterns for actual work. <em>Promoted prompts as interface actions</em> like “Improve Writing” or “Summarize” buttons embed common natural language instructions into traditional UI elements, removing the need for users to type. These approaches differ fundamentally because they either don’t sustain the interaction (intent capture is just an entry point) or don’t require active natural language input (the instruction is predefined in the button).</p><h3>Reflections: How tools are built today and what’s ahead</h3><p>Looking at tools launched in 2024–2025, most follow a familiar structure: <a href=""https://www.thirteen23.com/updates/the-prompt-box-paradox"">start with an intent capture page</a> (templates, starter prompts), then route users to either Pattern 1 for conversational tasks or Pattern 3 for agent-driven work. Pattern 2 appears as embedded features within existing tools.</p><p>As tools mature, frequently-used prompts get “promoted” into buttons such as “Improve Writing,” “Summarize,” “Translate.” Natural language coexists with traditional UI, reducing friction for common tasks while preserving flexibility for open-ended prompting.</p><p>This structure isn’t entirely new, it mirrors how traditional software has been built for decades. Classic tools also started with an onboarding or template selection page, then moved users into the main workflow interface. The difference now is that within that workflow page, natural language acts as a new control layer, either as a control panel (Pattern 3) orchestrating work, or as an action bar (Pattern 2) augmenting existing canvas-based workflows.</p><h4>What patterns might emerge?</h4><p>As we move through 2026, one interesting question that strikes my mind is that, how will human intervention and interaction loop in these AI tools evolve?</p><figure><img alt=""Animated GIF showing a human finger and a robotic finger reaching toward each other against a cosmic sky background, symbolizing connection between humans and machines."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/0*in9E65KC0ifJVc5V.gif"" /></figure><p>Many tools have started addressing intervention, but few experiences have become overwhelming with multiple pause points, confirmation dialogs, and approval gates. The challenge is making intervention intuitive and natural, not just possible. Also, the users need to develop an strong mental model for when to step in versus when to trust the agent.</p><p>Also supervision isn’t enough. The real challenge is understanding <em>how and why the agent made changes</em>, a concern central to <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/guidelines-for-human-ai-interaction/"">Microsoft Research’s guidelines for human-AI interaction</a>.</p><blockquote>As agents become more capable, we risk creating dependency where users accomplish tasks but don’t understand the underlying work.</blockquote><p>This is critical for people learning new skills</p><p>When an agent generates code or modifies a design, users need to comprehend the reasoning: not just “lines 45–67 changed,” but “here’s why this approach, here’s the trade-off, here’s what else was considered.” Yet there’s a critical gap: agents can provide these explanations, but users still need foundational knowledge to fully grasp them. An explanation of why a particular code structure was chosen doesn’t help if you don’t understand fundamentals.</p><p>Without this understanding, users can’t effectively intervene, correct, or extend the work. They become dependent on the agent to modify its own output.Aubergine (2025) calls this the “<a href=""https://www.aubergine.co/insights/designing-for-ai-agents"">learning arc</a>” problem.</p><p>By designing systems that show learning progression, users experience agents as reliable collaborators that grow alongside them, not opaque black boxes.</p><p>The next generation of interaction model needs to balance efficiency with transparency. The design goal shifts from “make AI do the work” to “help users understand what’s being done and how they could do it themselves,” addressing what researchers at CHI 2020 identified as the <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376301"">unique difficulties in designing human-AI interaction</a>.</p><p>As product builders, our task is to observe how these interaction patterns perform, understand where they succeed and struggle, and continue pushing toward interfaces that make powerful tools that leverages accessibility, learnability and human control.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=8b39ed123c39"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/beyond-conversations-natural-language-as-interaction-influencer-8b39ed123c39"">Beyond conversations: natural language as interaction influencer</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

web brings with it new design tools, these tools change how we design websites and also influences the next generation of design tools to come.</p><p>I know it seems like a novel idea for some of you reading this, you might think you design the websites you want to design and you’re only limited by your imagination, but you’re only half-right.</p><p>That’s somewhat true but also you’re human and all humans are lazy sometimes and we like to design websites that are easily designed and easily developed, we don’t like friction, as any designer who studied UX already knows.</p><p>So as Marshall McLuhan once said “The medium is the message”, meaning that our ever-changing medium does box us into certain realities as we approach the tools for web design.</p><p>In this article I’ll try to go over the different tools for designing the web as they were used in chronological order, of course some of these tools got used simultaneously so there is no clean cut.</p><p>But I’ll do my best to paint the history of web design tools in stages as I lived through them, so let’s begin.</p><p>First, we had plain HTML.</p><h3>HTML</h3><p>Before any design tool ever existed, there was HTML, it was (and still is) the most fundamental building material of the web.</p><p>When HTML was the only way to design websites we had WYSIWYG interfaces to better move around what was essentially just HTML tags like paragraphs, headings, tables and images.</p><p>CSS didn’t exist yet so all the styling was done inside of the actual HTML itself (remember <em>bgcolor</em>?) and the only way to center anything was to use tables and make their borders invisible.</p><p>In some ways simple HTML styling lives on today in email newsletters and passion projects but the web itself has moved on to better things.</p><p>Websites of this area were made to emphasis the tags and their aesthetics were unique with lots of GIFs, lots or background images that repeated themselves endlessly, and of course some background music to set the mood.</p><p>The most well known offender in this category of early 90s websites was GeoCities, which did offer a WYSIWYG editor for everybody to use for free.</p><figure><img alt=""GeoCities web editor was one of the first publicly available WYSIWYG editors."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/0*YLJ_Xt0xreCr6UIh""

href=""https://plbrault.com/blog-posts/i-used-netscape-composer-in-2024/"">Link</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Websites of that era were built for Netscape or later for Internet Explorer, nobody ever tried to make their websites cross compatible and they all just worked sometimes.</p><p>These compatibility issues often occurred while using specific tags (that aren’t in use anymore) like lots of <em>marquee</em> tags, <em>framesets</em>, <em>blink</em> tags and more.</p><p>Those were visually unique but ultimately were deprecated for accessibility and/ or security reasons, so we could only find them in early web design relics.</p><p>Speaking of security concerns, then came Flash</p><h3>Flash</h3><p>When Macromedia Flash (later — Adobe Flash) became the standard tool everyone was both a designer and a developer, Flash had its own scripting language called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript""><em>ActionScript</em></a> and it’s own animation-driven interface.</p><p>As a result people started replacing their entire websites with Flash sites, these sites were very animated and very tailored to their needs, no more templates and no more copying HTML tags from one another (Flash sites were nutritiously closed off — unlike HTML “<em>view source</em>” feature)</p><p>Flash transformed the web more than any other tool, it made the entire web dependent on its proprietary technology, it made us all developers and animators, and sometimes even game designers.</p><p>As a result those sites were often bloated, since optimization was optional, and they were very unfriendly to SEO, since it was all closed off.</p><figure><img alt=""Newgrounds landing page from the early 2000s."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/0*6Uw-fXM3AN3_hkeX.jpg"" /><figcaption>Newgrounds — If you know, you know.</figcaption></figure><p>But the Flash era was the most creative the web had even been, Flash websites could do pretty much anything we could imagine, Flash games were also a big thing in the mid-2000s, see Newgrounds website above.</p><p>Flash is still alive in the form of Adobe Animate, but today it’s less geared towards websites, since the web had moved on — partly since the web moved to a mobile first web.</p><p>Flash websites were bloated and had security issues but above all else: they weren’t responsive enough to survive in the mobile internet era, when screen real estate and battery life were much more scarce.</p><p>I encourage everyone to read “<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20170615060422/https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/"">Thoughts on Flash</a>” by Steve Jobs, it sums the problems with Flash on mobile devices nicely.</p><h3>Photoshop / Illustrator</h3><p>Photoshop and Illustrator are both Adobe products, they weren’t new at this point but the industry defaulted to them when Flash was on its deathbed.</p><p>When Flash was no longer the dominant design tool for the web, nothing could really fill its place, so the industry moved on to the tools that were already proven to stick around.</p><p>This era of web design felt especially static, as designers only designed Desktop and Mobile websites, with often nothing in between, keep in mind that iPads weren’t a thing yet and/ or just came out.</p><figure><img alt=""An Illustrator-designed website, it was never great."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*3aY-7j9JtQ37VdXa"" /><figcaption>An Illustrator-designed website, it was never great.</figcaption></figure><p>Everything was done manually using hard labor, no automation, no tools to make the process any easier, certainly no specialized tools yet.</p><p>Photoshop and Illustrator are general purpose software — Photoshop is for editing images and Illustrator is for editing vector shapes, none of them were made for web design specifically.</p><p>As a result they had many tools that were irrelevant to Product Design and many relevant tools were missing.</p><p>These relevant/ irrelevant tools were the blueprint for the next generation of tools, that built upon the workflow of Photoshop/ Illustrator and decided what tools to include and what tools to exclude.</p><p>Photoshop and Illustrator as web design tools were never great tools for the job, but they were great at being placeholders until some more specialized tools arrived.</p><h3>Sketch</h3><p>Sketch, for many designers, was just that — a new tool built from the ground up for Product Design (or UI Design, as it was called then). Sketch didn’t have the bloat Photoshop and Illustrator had since it was purpose built.</p><figure><img alt=""Sketch circa 2017, image from Newbird"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*LduuUHZW42-rfbQ5.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Sketch circa 2017, image from Newbird (<a href=""https://newbird.com/digital-design-tool-review-sketch-app/"">Link</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The application itself and the tools in it were lean and were exactly what users wanted. I didn’t get into Sketch although a lot of my friends and colleagues did. Sketch was (and still is) a Mac only application so I knew it can’t be the tool of the future.</p><p>There were entire industries built on Windows PCs and the Mac-only Sketch were making a lot of problems in their pipelines, for example: the gaming industry, the data security industry, AR &amp; VR (at the time), the banking industry etc.</p><p>Sketch did a lot of things right but eventually the one thing it did was making the entire design industry reconsider the tools they use.</p><p>Sketch walked so Figma could run.</p><h3>Figma</h3><p>Figma wasn’t just a cross-platform version of Sketch, Figma took the formula that Sketch made of lean and precise design tool specifically made for UI design and expanded upon it.</p><figure><img alt=""Figma in 2019, image from OneSignal"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*bd9eOPG0mhlINjkR.jpg"" /><figcaption>Figma in 2019, image from OneSignal (<a href=""https://onesignal.com/blog/designing-with-figma/"">Link</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>It was a new kind of tool — it was an online first tool, Figma was available from your browser, without any installation (when it did that, it was all new and exciting, I know today it’s more common).</p><p>Since it was all online, Figma files could also be shared and worked on together, Figma had the most advanced “multiplayer” tools I’ve ever seen, which meant designers can work together on the same design file and in the same time, since it was all online.</p><p>Think of Google Docs, you can also edit the same file in Google Docs, or the same code in a Git repository, for example, but Figma brought the same philosophy into a design tool and since then many tools tried to do the same.</p><p>Since Figma tried to be lean (much like Sketch before it), many tools were dropped in the process, no more photo editing tools, limited filters, limited Motion Design tools, no 3D tools etc.</p><p>On the other side many new tools were introduced, responsive design controls for every frame, a prototyping tool and auto-layout controls — just to name a few.</p><figure><img alt=""An example of responsive design in Figma."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/610/0*LTf-cs6mmbWU2up_.png"" /><figcaption>An example of responsive design in Figma.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, Figma was very “flat” looking by design and more detailed work was harder to achieve, many still used Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop for detail design and many just gave up and embraced the flatness.</p><p>Since advanced Motion, Animations or working with 3D elements is virtually impossible in Figma and as a result, those elements are very rare to see in the web today.</p><p>I would argue that to this day, features like Motion Design and 3D work are still missing since they weren’t present in the original catch-all tools Photoshop/ Illustrator and as a result they are still missing from Figma today.</p><p>Just to be clear — I am not against any of it, I like flat design and I think intelligent design can be done in any style and in any medium, regardless of the rendered output, when I say “<em>flat</em>” I don’t mean it as a criticism — just as a visual observation.</p><h3>Closing words</h3><p>From no tools for design, through WYSIWYG and Flash, Photoshop/ Illustrator, Sketch and of course Figma it was quite a ride.</p><p>The tools change not only <strong>how</strong> we design interactive websites but <strong>what</strong> we design as well, including how they look, how they work and how the users experience them.

In the early 1800s, belief didn’t require conviction, it required attendance. You inherited your faith the same way you inherited your surname, and no one seemed particularly bothered by the gap between saying the right words and understanding what they meant.</p><p>People were comfortable with answers being given to them before questions were even asked. Faith was spoken about constantly, often with confidence, but this confidence felt rehearsed. Kierkegaard couldn’t tell if people ever wrestled with or questioned their beliefs.</p><p>Eventually, he realized there was nothing <em>to</em> question. The system had already done the hard part. The role of the individual was to nod in agreement. This created a kind of harmony, but a shallow one… a collective certainty that never had to prove itself against anything real.</p><p>As he grew older, Kierkegaard saw how quickly certainty had replaced belief. Whenever a group becomes too sure of itself, it stops producing individuals capable of doing the inward work that faith requires. People learn to <em>perform</em> conviction rather than <em>develop</em> it. Say something often enough and you can skip the part where you understand (or question) it.</p><p>He noticed another pattern: People spoke confidently about truths they had never encountered firsthand, truths they had never risked anything to understand. And inherited certainty revealed an uncomfortable vulnerability: Once you depend on a system to hand you your conclusions, you tend to move as the system moves… and you move with confidence.</p><p>Kierkegaard wasn’t worried about disbelief. He wasn’t even worried about people changing their minds. His concern was <a href=""https://www.sorenkierkegaard.org/""><strong>unearned belief.</strong></a><strong> </strong>Conviction without scrutiny and identity without introspection. The key here, is that the desire for certainty often poses as a strength, but usually signals the opposite:</p><p><strong>A lack of faith.</strong></p><p>A society can become so certain of its truths that it forgets how to look for them. Faith gets replaced by the appearance of faith. Inquiry becomes unnecessary (and frowned upon), and once that happens, no one notices the cost:</p><p>How easily people trade the effort of trying to understand for the comfort of believing (and being told) they already do.</p><h3><strong>The mechanics of unearned certainty</strong></h3><p>Certainty has a way of sounding like confidence, but Kierkegaard knew it’s usually the result of something else. People reach for certainty when the truth underneath gets a little shaky. It feels safer to defend an answer than to admit the question hasn’t been resolved.</p><p><em>And from here on, when we talk about “faith,” we’re using Kierkegaard’s meaning — not belief in a doctrine, but the inner stance required to live with unanswered questions. If that sounds narrowly religious, it’s a misread. Kierkegaard is describing a stance that shows up wherever people have to act without guarantees: in innovation, in design, in leadership, and many other forms of work.</em></p><p>For him, faith was never meant to be a conclusion. This stance was an ongoing willingness to live with what can’t be guaranteed. But certainty makes a different promise. It offers closure. It lets a person stop examining what they believe and start repeating it instead, resulting in something that feels like strength (even when nothing has been strengthened).</p><p>Systems (institutions) depend on predictability, and certainty delivers. It keeps people aligned, keeps roles stable, and keeps operations smooth enough that no one has to confront the inner workings. Churches, governments, workplaces, even families in their more rigid forms, all learn to reward conviction that doesn’t ask questions. Call it clarity or discipline or commitment, but the effect is the same: the more certainty people perform, the less individual they become.</p><p>This creates a loop that’s hard to break. People adopt certainty because it makes them feel secure. Institutions reinforce certainty because it makes people easier to manage. And the more those two forces reinforce each other, the more faith becomes something referenced rather than lived.</p><p>Unearned certainty has consequences. As it takes over, faith has nothing left to do. The questions don’t disappear, but people learn to avoid them. Individuals learn to shrink to fit the expectations of the system… and the system rewards the shrinking.</p><h3>The altitude where faith stops being allowed</h3><p>Systems don’t eliminate faith outright. They don’t have to. They simply move it to a place it can’t interfere with anything important. Faith becomes symbolic (something you reference or admire) while certainty takes over all the places where actual decisions get made.</p><p>Real faith requires inwardness. It asks for reflection, doubt, and examination. It forces a person to confront what they believe and why. That kind of faith creates individuals, but guess what? Individuals complicate systems.</p><p>But if you lift faith out of lived experience and into abstraction, it stops being disruptive. It becomes something recited rather than wrestled with. You stop practicing it and start admiring it. A system can allow that kind of faith because it never threatens the model. It doesn’t challenge authority or create variance. And it certainly doesn’t create individuals.</p><p>So institutions learn to reserve certainty for the ground level (where behavior happens) and faith for the clouds, where it can’t disrupt anything. Super subtle… super effective. People are encouraged to feel faithful while acting certain. They speak as if belief guides them, but their choices follow the conclusions they were given.</p><p>Over time, faith becomes an ornament. Something safe at a high altitude. And the higher it rises, the less room there is for the kind of faith Kierkegaard actually meant: the kind that forms a self.</p><h3>The modern landscape of managed truth</h3><p>In Kierkegaard’s time, people didn’t have access to the full picture. We do. We have more information, more perspectives, more lived experiences and more context than any moment that came before us. And somehow, the more we gained in perspective, the more firmly we settled into our conclusions.</p><p>Institutions don’t limit information… they package it and hand us interpretations wrapped in language that tell us what a “reasonable” or “moral” person should think. White papers, talking points, abacus briefs, policy summaries — all built to steer us toward conclusions that feel responsible without requiring us to understand the full situation.</p><p>It’s a familiar pattern. You don’t have to comprehend the complexity. You only need to sound aligned with it. Certainty becomes a performance of being well-informed, and systems reward the performance because it keeps everything moving in one direction.</p><p>This creates a strange contradiction. We now have unprecedented access to the full picture, but we rarely use it. We reach for summaries, frameworks, pre-digested opinions, and the moral scaffolding provided by the groups we belong to. We inherit not just the conclusions, but the emotional stance that comes with them. We feel confident long before we comprehend anything.</p><p>Getting information hasn’t been the barrier. The part no system can automate for us is the effort needed to understand the full picture.</p><p>People stop wrestling with ideas because the system makes wrestling feel unnecessary. Certainty is faster. Certainty is cleaner. Certainty signals belonging.</p><p>The tragedy is this: certainty has never been easier to acquire, and understanding has never required more from us.</p><h3>The psychological cost</h3><p>Dependence doesn’t really announce itself. It doesn’t feel like surrender or even like trust. For most, it feels like relief. It’s the relief of not having to hold the weight of your own conclusions. But once that relief settles in, the work of examining what you believe starts to fade because someone else has taken on that responsibility.</p><p>This is where certainty becomes a habit, and habits reshape identity.</p><p>When certainty becomes the default position, people stop defending ideas and start defending themselves. Think about the last couple disagreements you had. They feel personal (not because the topic was important, but) because certainty is doing the psychological heavy lifting. It keeps the self coherent. It keeps your view on the world intact.</p><p>To Kierkegaard, certainty can’t survive examination. It depends on avoiding questions, not engaging them. Faith works in the opposite direction. Faith strengthens under examination. It depends on someone willing to confront whatever might be uncovered.</p><p>Where certainty is rewarded, so is avoidance (or disciplined with guilt if confronted). And avoidance eventually hollows out a person from within. If you can be predictable, that’s a sign of stability. Alignment starts to look like maturity. People learn to treat their beliefs the way they treat their job descriptions: something maintained through compliance rather than reflection.</p><p>But here’s what happens: once certainty becomes an identity, people stop seeking truth. They start seeking reinforcement.</p><p>At that point, who cares about faith?</p><h3>The turn</h3><p>There’s an overlooked difference between certainty and faith, and it explains what I think Kierkegaard worried about.</p><p>When your goal is certainty, you have to win the moment. It demands immediate validation because it can’t tolerate the possibility of being wrong… not even briefly. Certainty must hold up under scrutiny right now, in real time, in front of witnesses.</p><p>Faith works on a different clock. It doesn’t panic when challenged or rush to close the gap. Faith can afford to lose the moment because it trusts that truth will be found over time. Faith plays the long-game, and in doing so, doesn’t look for quick wins because it knows it needs to understand the whole picture. Faith needs clarity. Where questions may be seen as threats to certainty, to faith, they’re healthy invitations.</p><p>This is why faith creates individuals and certainty creates loyalists.</p><p>Systems reward the people who need to win today. They’re predictable. They’re motivated. They’re aligned. People who run on faith (patient, reflective, grounded) are harder to manage. They aren’t in a hurry, and they aren’t afraid of being wrong. The bottom line is they don’t feel like their identity is at stake.</p><p>Once you see the difference, you can see why certainty thrives wherever institutions want control, and why faith survives only where individuals are willing to take responsibility for themselves.</p><p>It’s the same reason creative departments are the first to go. Creativity introduces possibility, and possibility threatens certainty.</p><p>Innovation works the same way. To innovate is to admit you might be wrong — to revise, rethink, even replace what you’ve built. Institutions built on certainty can’t tolerate that, so they cut the functions that would force it.</p><h3>Faith as the work of becoming a person</h3><p>Kierkegaard didn’t argue against certainty because he disliked confidence. He saw what it replaced. Certainty stands in the spot where an individual is supposed to develop.</p><p>Faith, as he meant it, was never about doctrinal agreement. It was about becoming someone capable of truth. This means someone who could be questioned without collapsing. Someone who could change without losing themselves in the process. Someone who didn’t need the comfort of winning today in order to grow tomorrow.</p><p>Systems will always prefer certainty. It keeps everything predictable and everyone aligned. They’re comfortable with faith only when it stays high enough not to interfere. Real faith lives lower… close to the ground, where it forms individuals instead of dependents.

<h4>Function is the floor, not the ceiling. It’s time to raise the bar and prove that the most viable products are the ones that feel human.</h4><figure><img alt=""Hand-drawn sheep, all identitical, face the same direction in a grid layout — baaaaa one. The odd-one-out is highlighted in pink and facing the opposite direction."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZSRvWvjMzqAy0DvT-1J3bg.png"" /><figcaption>Escaping the AI Sludge</figcaption></figure><p>AI is now omnipresent in our workflows, but it's come at a cost: a sea of sameness. Lately, products have begun to look and feel homogeneous &amp; indistinguishable, leading to diluted brands and increasingly sterile interactions. Big tech paves the way for others to follow; It’s time to stop settling for “good enough” and blindly following established conventions. Let’s continue to solve user problems and challenge the attitudes of an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) through the use of craft.</p><p>As explored in a recent <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/26/upshot/ai-synthetic-data.html"">New York Times interactive</a>, an LLM’s output is tethered to its training data, revealing a fundamental limitation we must be aware of: AI is a master of regurgitation, not revelation. By drawing from a finite pool of existing designs, these models produce an exponential volume of garbled content — similar to a game of Chinese Whispers where the quality of the message degrades with every time it is retold. While these outputs meet functional requirements, they lack the distinct emotional character and style typically derived from an organic human-design process, required to stand out in a crowded marketplace.</p><p>In this article, I address a growing concern regarding the current state of MVP delivery in consumer products. We stand at a precarious intersection: the pressure to ship fast is colliding with a rising tide of generic AI outputs. We must dissect how designers can retain their creative edge in this environment and empower them to push back against stakeholders for the product's success. The challenge before us is not just to learn how to use new tools, but to continue to push past what’s been done before and continuously set new standards for the products we ship.</p><p>And so, we need to continue to elevate our craft. We must move beyond the basic utility of the MVP and change our attitudes on experiential standards — creating work that proves, unequivocally, that there is a human behind the design of every screen.</p><p>As popularised by Maya Angelou, American poet and civil rights activist:</p><blockquote>“At the end of the day, people won’t remember what you said or did; they will remember how you made them feel.”</blockquote><p><em>While Angelou may have popularised the sentiment later, </em><a href=""https://speeches.byu.edu/speakers/carl-w-buehner/""><em>Buehner</em></a><em> is the earliest recorded source.</em></p><figure><img alt=""A hand-drawn illustration, by Ryan Gillet, of a two people carrying freshly prepared food from the oven. The pair seem to very pleased with the delights of their cooking."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xgMch7zKNt_CbWfjJDQ3QQ.png"" /><figcaption>Illustration by Ryan Gillet</figcaption></figure><h3>The common misconception of MVPs</h3><p>The MVP, popularised by Eric Ries in <a href=""https://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html""><em>Lean Startup (2011)</em></a>, is often viewed as a functional baseline; it is a stripped-back product intended to prove viability today, with the future promise of augmentation reserved for tomorrow (subject to demand, resources &amp; budget — to name a few!) While many MVPs successfully meet basic user needs, they often fail to deliver a unique or engaging experience. This ordinary quality makes them bland and easily imitated by competitors, making it difficult for a brand to stand out and become compelling.</p><p>To understand the <strong>gap between function and value</strong>, consider a parallel from the physical world: the newly constructed house. At its core, a new build fulfils a functional requirement, providing essential shelter and space. Yet, without personalisation and decoration, it remains a generic structure, a standard configuration of walls and windows that is often repeated worldwide; We’ve seen it all before. It is a commodity, not a destination.</p><p>A house only becomes truly <em>desirable</em> when it transcends its utility. It requires the texture of life: the specific choice of paint, the curated furniture, and the family photos on the mantle. Without these personal touches, the structure creates no emotional resonance. It lacks the essential ingredients that transform a house into a home.</p><p>In product design, as in architecture, the structure is merely the canvas. It’s not until you apply a layer of craft that the screen turns from a habitable space into a valuable one.</p><p>And so, product teams must go beyond just a bare-bones MVP and strive for something desirable. This means crafting a superior user experience unlike other products that meet &amp; surpass a user’s needs &amp; expectations. This approach is crucial for gaining a competitive advantage and establishing a strong, lasting connection with your customers.</p><figure><img alt=""A joyful hand-drawn illustration, by Ryan Gillet, of a couple seasoning their food."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YcfK92q9XNakNjSlCUT3ZA.png"" /><figcaption>Illustration by Ryan Gillet</figcaption></figure><h3>We need to change our attitudes toward MVPs</h3><p>The real issue, in my opinion, however, isn’t solved by a new acronym (something the tech industry already has plenty of!) [<a href=""https://excited.agency/blog/minimum-lovable-product#:~:text=Conclusion-,What's%20a%20minimum%20lovable%20product%3F,bestselling%20book%2C%20%22Lovability%22"">MLP — Minimum Loveable Product</a>]. The issue is that we often fail to build truly <em>viable</em> MVPs from the start. Henrik Ståhl’s article, <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/minimum-viable-whatever-ae78c5ad1e3d""><em>Minimal Viable Whatever</em></a><em>,</em> earlier this year, made me question my work when throwing about the acronym “MVP”.</p><blockquote>How do we know that the minimum thing we’re doing is viable enough?</blockquote><p>A consumer product, put simply, cannot be viable (from a business perspective) without a strong <strong>brand voice</strong> and a delightful <strong>customer experience</strong>. To further the house metaphor, a family is unlikely to have bought the house in the first place if all the inner services of the building were exposed &amp; its walls laid bare. Typically, a property developer would furnish the space to give it the best chance of a sale and further enhance their ROI. And so, maybe the issue lies with companies shipping half-baked MVPs in a need to generate revenue.</p><p>Building an enjoyable and satisfying product shouldn’t be seen as an additional arduous task to be deferred until after the delivery of an MVP. It’s too late by then; users will have already formed an opinion about the product &amp; the wider brand. It’s hard to change someone’s first impressions. Similar to property developers, tech companies would likely achieve a greater return on investment if they were to delay launch until version one of their product was “finished.”</p><figure><img alt=""A hand-drawn illustration, by Ryan Gillet, of a chef revealling a present otherwise hidden by their chef’s hat."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4n6y3DPJpyAzMD6zDMepbg.png"" /><figcaption>Illustration by Ryan Gillet</figcaption></figure><h3>What do I mean by delightful experiences?</h3><p>If “craft” has established itself as the <a href=""https://trends.uxdesign.cc/"">defining design buzzword in 2024–2025</a> in light of AI assurgence, then “<em>delight</em>” is its emotional predecessor — and perhaps its most crucial outcome. While the two concepts are deeply intertwined, distinguishing them helps us understand what actually elevates a product from “good” to “beloved.”</p><p>To understand delight, we have to look past the code and the pixels. When done well, delight is the bridge that takes a user interaction beyond the baseline requirements of functionality and usability. As UX researcher <a href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327590IJHC1304_07"">Marc Hassenzahl notes</a>, true delight isn’t found in the product’s surface features, but in its ability to satisfy ‘Hedonic’ needs — such as competence and stimulation — while seamlessly handling and optimising ‘Pragmatic’ tasks like time efficiencies.</p><h4>What <em>delights</em> us as Humans?</h4><p>Why do some tools make us feel empowered while others leave us drained? As psychologists Edward Deci and Richard Ryan demonstrated through <a href=""https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/theory/"">Self-Determination Theory</a>, our most meaningful experiences are rooted in how well a tool supports our human needs. They identified three essential drivers that must be met for us to feel truly motivated and ‘delighted’ by an experience:</p><ul><li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> The need to feel in control of one’s own actions and choices.</li><li><strong>Competence:</strong> The need to feel effective, capable, and “smart” while performing a task.</li><li><strong>Relatedness:</strong> The need to feel connected to others or valued within a community.</li></ul><p>In the words of Shipra Kayan in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/medium.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fuxdesign.cc%2Fdelight-is-not-cute-flourishes-2a1ce118ced5""><em>Delight is not cute flourishes</em></a><em>:</em></p><blockquote>Moments of delight can only happen when products help people be smarter, feel fulfilled, and avoid mundane tasks.</blockquote><p>We must stop equating delight with cute decorative florishes. Real delight is the quiet satisfaction of a tool that anticipates and fulfils a user’s needs.</p><p>Here are some nice examples I’ve come across:</p><ol><li>Apple: Helping users when they’re not expecting it</li></ol><figure><img alt=""3 screenshots of Apple’s iphone Wifi sharing flow. The bottom sheet appears when a contact is wanting to join a new wifi router, catching the user by surprise."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*324-MA4fv6Bywm_omyz23A.png"" /></figure><p>2. Duolingo — Welcome back message</p><figure><img alt=""a series of 3 screens detailing Duolingo UI recalling when a user has been inactive for a prolonged period of time.

Monzo — Get paid early</p><figure><img alt=""Monzo’s get paid early flow where users interact by dragging the cash illustration down into a wallet to complete the task."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9kJQjy1kOMSyFBptabj-pw.png"" /></figure><h3>What delight is not…</h3><p>To understand the value of delight, we must first dismantle the misconceptions that have diluted its meaning. There is a tendency in product design to treat delight as the “cherry on top” — the final step to be taken only if the budget and resourcing permit.</p><p><strong>It is not decoration.</strong> Delight is not an expensive afterthought or a superficial layer of polish applied to a finished product. Single UI alone cannot mask a poor experience. If the core functionality is broken, no amount of charming illustrations or witty copy can save it. In fact, applying “delight” to a screen in a frustrating user flow often feels more patronising than enjoyable.</p><p><strong>It is not a gimmick.</strong> True delight is not merely a fleeting “wow” moment. Flashy animations or unexpected interactions that are disconnected from the user’s core needs are distractions, not delight. If an interaction dazzles the user but ultimately slows them down or confuses their progress, it has failed.</p><p><strong>It is not a checkbox.</strong> Perhaps most importantly, delight is not a line item on a product roadmap to be marked “done” and forgotten. It cannot be treated as an optional extra, dependent on whether the team has leftover capacity.</p><p>Instead, real delight is the result of a <strong>holistic and intentional approach</strong>. It is woven into the product's architecture from day one, demonstrating that the designers respect the user’s time, intelligence, and emotional state.</p><h3>Delight only works when basic expectations are met</h3><p><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/theory-user-delight/?source=post_page-----4c96e0bf00f4---------------------------------------"">Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs</a> taught us that basic needs act as a gateway to higher motivations (love, self-esteem, and creativity). Our basic survival needs must be met before any higher motivations can influence behaviour. Put simply, you don’t worry about “creativity” when you’re worried about finding your next meal.</p><p>Product development requires the same discipline. We must ruthlessly prioritise utility first. Until the software runs without bugs and the core problem is solved, emotional design is merely decoration. You cannot charm a user who is struggling to log in…!</p><p>This brings us to the crux of the issue: In an era where AI tools are democratizing development and efficiency, utility is no longer a differentiator — it is a commodity. When any competitor can use an LLM to generate functional code or optimise a workflow, simply “working error-free” becomes the bare minimum requirement for entry. To build a product that is not only commercially viable but truly “sticky,” <strong>utility alone is not a competitive advantage — it’s just the baseline. </strong>To create a commercially viable product, teams must move beyond a product that works to a product that <em>feels right</em>. This is where design craft will continue to be a product differentiator.</p><figure><img alt=""A hand-drawn illustration, by Ryan Gillet, of a giant palm guiding the user through their journey."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aBQ3rfdWcQd9YsWkmZsefw.png"" /><figcaption>Illustration by Ryan Gillet</figcaption></figure><h3>Delight vs User Satisfaction</h3><p>Delight and user satisfaction are not the same thing. While both are positive outcomes in user experience, they represent different levels of emotional engagement.</p><p><strong>User satisfaction</strong> refers to a user’s contentment with a product or service. It’s the feeling of having their needs met by achieving something or having a want met. A user is satisfied when a product works as expected, is easy to use, and fulfils its intended purpose. This is the <strong>non-negotiable prerequisite</strong> for quality.</p><p><strong>Delight</strong> goes a step further. It’s an emotional response that exceeds a user’s expectations. <a href=""https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/delight_1"">Delight is the feeling of great pleasure</a>, joy, or even awe that comes from an interaction with a product or service. It’s what transforms a good experience into a great one. For example, a user is satisfied when a mobile banking app processes a transaction quickly. They are delighted when the app congratulates them on their first successful deposit with a celebratory animation.</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong> plays a pivotal role in this distinction. “Think of delight as a crescendo — a powerful, high-impact climax to an experience. However, not every click and interaction in a user flow is going to generate excitement. And that’s ok, otherwise the experience would be overstimulating and just irritating. User<strong> </strong>satisfaction, on the other hand, operates differently: it may offer a lower perceived value in the moment, but it sustains the product experience through a steady, reliable rhythm.</p><figure><img alt=""A pen-drawn illustrative arrow pointing down"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*h93bIqp-7TQQ-z2_LZE7AA.png"" /></figure><blockquote>That’s great and all but how can we put this theory into practice…?</blockquote><figure><img alt=""A simple flow diagram of a typical product delivery roadmap: First the product is designed &amp; developed, then typically the MVP is shipped &amp; then teams give the product personality &amp; soul via a Minimum Loveable Product."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_r_kCziOcO1U6ButNyb7dA.png"" /><figcaption>Is a product truly ‘viable’ if it doesn’t connect emotionally? We need to rethink why personality is often cut from the MVP.</figcaption></figure><h3>Delight is not at the end of a product roadmap</h3><p>Delight should not be viewed as a nice-to-have garnish or a static end destination, as illustrated above — It’s a Foundation. To treat design as a purely functional ‘Point A to Point B’ exercise is like approaching a first date with zero personality or charisma. You may have technically shown up, but nobody builds a relationship devoid of emotion. Would you expect a second date? Absolutely not — and products are no different. <strong>When we strip away emotion, we strip away the incentive to return. </strong>Crucially, if that first encounter is defined by generic experiences that are indifferent, you aren’t getting a second chance. First impressions are notoriously difficult to rewrite, which is why deferring ‘personality’ until after the MVP is a strategic oversight. By then, the user has already judged the brand; if you didn’t delight them at the start, you’ve likely lost them for good.</p><p>Brands that create emotional experiences with their audiences are the most commercially viable (The proof is in the previous example: Apple, Monzo, and Duolingo have already set the gold standard for this approach). While often relegated to the ‘nice-to-have’ category, designing for delight represents a significant, untapped lever for product performance. Far from being an aesthetic indulgence, designing for delight is a high-impact lever for product performance. It drives the metrics that matter most: long-term retention, stickiness, and Lifetime Value (LTV). Moreover, it turns users into a self-sustaining marketing engine, slashing customer acquisition costs (CAC) through natural, fan-led referrals. In this light, delight is a key component of “viability.” <strong>When build resources are tight, emotional resonance shouldn’t be the first thing we descope — it should be the reason we build in the first place.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Whimsical, hand-drawn illustration, by Ryan Gillet, of a waiter or chef in a tall toque lifting a cloche from a serving tray with a flourish."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iSw4Hxb6nGnOUJR4RpL71Q.png"" /><figcaption>Illustration by Ryan Gillet</figcaption></figure><h3>Let’s build desirable MVPs</h3><p>Successful product teams enhance a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) by focusing on a continuous cycle of building, measuring, and learning. The process is not about launching a single, final product, but rather viewing the product as organic and ever-evolving based on an active user feedback loop. In my opinion, the term delight should be intrinsic to the product’s “viability” as it should be a byproduct of a business and product agenda.</p><h4>Strategies the best teams adopt:</h4><ul><li>Establish a <strong>continuous discovery process</strong>, ensuring that every product/business evolution is anchored in real-world user insights rather than assumptions.</li><li>Let the <strong>data lead</strong>: the best teams prioritise development cycles by weighing features against hard metrics and validated user needs.</li><li><strong>Design for the user, not the workflow: </strong>Create resonant experiences that move past utility and acknowledge the emotional intent behind a task, ensuring that completion feels like a win rather than a digital chore.</li><li>Teams <strong>own &amp; champion emotional design</strong>, acknowledging its commercial benefit.</li><li>View <strong>every release as a hypothesis</strong>: replace guesswork with continual validation to ensure product refinements evolve in tandem with user behaviour.</li><li><strong>Delight cannot exist in a vacuum. </strong>Teams prioritise a functional baseline, ensuring products adhere to the highest accessibility standards before attempting to layer on emotional resonance.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Whimsical, hand-drawn illustration, by Ryan Gillet, of a joyful character in a pillbox hat and jacket, waving enthusiastically with energetic motion lines."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yivYkv7DYHnIiWHYXJHgGw.png"" /><figcaption>Illustration by Ryan Gillet</figcaption></figure><h3>Key principles to adopt</h3><h4>For design &amp; product teams</h4><ol><li><strong>Change product attitudes</strong>: Delight should not be seen as an additive or a nice-to-have; it should be baked into our product design experience.</li><li>Even in an MVP, <strong>delight should be intrinsic</strong> to the product’s “viability”.</li><li><strong>How we communicate:</strong> When presenting our work, we should not frame delight as an add-on or an extra. It is the solution that meets the brief. Without the added delight, the product does not perform as well as it could against its goals.</li><li><strong>Hold ourselves to account:</strong> Designing for delight focuses on delivering an emotive experience &amp; unexpected rewards to users, rather than solely on the products themselves. We should aim to make the experience a pleasure, not a chore.</li><li><strong>Don’t ship half-baked features;</strong> ship fully viable products.</li><li><strong>Experiment!</strong> Designers should foster a culture of experimentation and rapid refinement. Through data collection, we’ll build evidence on the impact of delight through in-app tests.</li><li><strong>Continual active feedback loop:</strong> Many MVPs are released without delight, and without action, we will still be descoping delight going forward. However, if we better analyse MVPs post-release, we’ll have an active feedback loop that will inform us where to make enhancements and create a business case for delightful improvements.</li></ol><h4>For products</h4><p>While the pursuit of deep delight may feel utopian, it forces us to sharpen our craft and further brands' relationships with their customers. Consequently, products must:</p><ul><li><strong>Anticipate and Adapt:</strong> Predict user needs and adjust the interface to the individual.</li><li><strong>Deliver Reliability:</strong> Work as expected (or better), every single time.</li><li><strong>Maintain Consistency:</strong> Unify form, tone, and voice so the product feels like a single entity.</li><li><strong>Promote authentic emotion over artificial celebration.</strong> We must stop using “confetti” for benign tasks. Users don’t need a digital party for simply logging in. For example, we must remember that a user doesn’t want a bank account; they want the financial control that an account offers. True delight doesn’t celebrate the tool; it connects directly to the user’s feelings about what they are achieving with it.</li><li><strong>Don’t mistake a functional product for a successful one. </strong>The real competitive edge isn’t just solving a problem — the most successful products are emotive, proving there’s a person behind the solution.</li></ul><h3>References</h3><p>For more illustrations, please check out the brilliant Ryan Gillet! <a href=""https://www.ryangillett.com/work"">https://www.ryangillett.com/work</a></p><p>Luke Murphy, Zero Heights, Building Delight into Your Design System <a href=""https://webinars.zeroheight.com/register/zeroheight-ds-live-luke-murphy-building-delight-into-your-design-system"">https://webinars.zeroheight.com/register/zeroheight-ds-live-luke-murphy-building-delight-into-your-design-system</a></p><p>Don Norman. 2005.

As much as we love diving headfirst into the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-2026-fashion-beauty-lookbook"">latest fashion trends</a>, there’s no denying the magnetic pull of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-free-people-fp-movement-sets-co-ords"">matching set</a> — from sweatsuits to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/womens-loungewear"">loungewear</a> — especially <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-jackets-for-women"">during the winter</a>. They’re cozy, comfy, cute — and, when made with quality and care,  built to last. Plus, they’re versatile! Toeing the line between <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nyfw-spring-summer-2026-soccer-sport-fashion-trend"">sporty athleisure</a> and polished co-ords, sweatsuits are the ultimate shortcut to looking casual yet put-together. <br /><br />Throw one on when you can't be bothered to style an outfit for running errands, going to workout classes, or attending a football game. Working remotely and need to feel slightly more “dressed” than your pajamas? Problem solved. And on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-travel-pants"">travel days</a>? Sweat sets are an MVP for curling up on chilly flights. (Bonus: You can break up a set and wear each piece separately, unlocking endless mix-and-match potential for those moments when you <em>actually</em> want to plan an outfit.)<br /><br />If you’re ready to retire those ratty, hole-y sweats that have seen you through college and countless days under your duvet (no judgment — we’ve <em>all</em> got <em>that</em> pair), consider yourself covered. Ahead, discover 21 cotton sets, waffle knit co-ords, and fleece layers for indoor hibernation mode <em>and</em> outdoorsy winter activities from retailers we love and trust, like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lululemon-boxing-day-sale"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Lululemon</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/free-people-under-100-gifts"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Free People</a>.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

<p>One of my favorite things about this job is getting to hunt for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-nail-manicure-trends-2025"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">manicure inspiration</a> and call it work. In the past few weeks, I’ve spotted (and promptly booked) <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/polka-dot-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">cat-eye polka-dot nails</a>, not to mention <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/argyle-sweater-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">argyle sweater nails</a>, and even <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nail-manicure-trends-2026"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">deer-print nails</a> — a cute winter alternative to tortoiseshell. But as I’ve been tracking the coolest trends, one color combination keeps coming up. Enter: blue and brown. Actually, I’m calling it blue suede. </p>



<p>I know what you’re thinking: it’s not the most obvious color pairing, and on paper, it shouldn’t work. But judging by Instagram’s nail artists, the duo is surprisingly dynamic, and it’s quickly becoming one of their most requested designs. </p>

<p>In the same way that the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/argyle-sweater-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">argyle pattern</a> has transcended fashion and made its way onto our nails, Griffiths thinks that our obsession with these shades comes from a small tweak we’re making to our closets: “I think recently a lot of people have been replacing black with chocolate brown as a softer wardrobe staple,” she says, adding, “Brown and blue as a nail combo will be trending as it’s a fun way to wear color, but it still somehow feels like you’re wearing neutrals as they match so easily to the clothes that most of us already have in our wardrobes.” It’s further proof that blue denim really does go with everything. </p>

<p>If you want to switch things up, some manicurists are replacing brown tones with rich burgundy, and while seeming like an unusual match, the various creations posted to Instagram prove otherwise.

<p>Plaid print nails aren’t going anywhere, but the 2026 upgrade is keeping things monochrome. Nail artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DQD8X2UE2Zc/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">kiri. wnia</a> has taken inspiration from Pantone’s Chicory Coffee (a smoky brown) and Blue Bell (a powdery pastel blue) and delicately layered them to create this blue and brown set that appears almost jelly-like.  </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11615068.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>I’ve never been the sort of person who <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-journals"">keeps a diary</a>. There was that fluffy padlocked notebook in my tweens, but I only ever occasionally remembered its existence. If I could find it now in the ruins and cardboard boxes of my childhood, it would likely be 85% blank pages, 10% doodles, and 5% “spy notes” about my family (nothing quite like scribbling down all of your loved ones’ movements, eh?).</p>



<p>Still, like countless others, I’ve spent a lot<em> </em>of time watching influencers’ morning and evening routines on social media. A <em>lot</em> of time. And, yes, I’ve noticed that almost all of them include <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ordinary-habit-for-now-wellness-journal-review"">a journaling session</a> or two. It makes a lot of sense: Studies have repeatedly shown that engaging in <a href=""https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentID=4552&amp;ContentTypeID=1"">regular journaling can help reduce stress</a>, manage anxiety and depression symptoms, enhance self-awareness, promote emotional regulation, provide opportunities for positive self-talk, and even strengthen resilience in the face of challenges. If you can stick to it. </p>



<p>Intrigued by all of the above, and keen to see if it could help me get a better handle on my own stresses and worries, I decided to give it a go for myself — but not before consulting with the experts. And, as you’ve likely guessed already, it turns out my snarky tween diary <em>definitely</em> wouldn’t cut it when it comes to reaping the myriad psychological benefits of this popular pastime. </p>



<p>“Journaling is essentially another way of saying ‘putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper,’ giving them a place to exist outside of our heads,” explains mental health advocate, author of <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Therapy-Magic-essential-life-changing-experiences-ebook/dp/B08YD5JLWL""><em>Therapy Is…Magic</em></a>, and trainee psychotherapist <a href=""https://www.jolove.co.uk/"">Jo Love</a>, describing it as a “tool that allows us to process our emotions and creates an opportunity for self-reflection.”</p>



<p>“Its effectiveness varies based on individual preferences and psychological needs,” adds author, psychologist and certified therapist, <a href=""https://www.kalanitbenari.com/about"">Kalanit Ben-Ari</a>, <a href=""https://www.kalanitbenari.com/about"">PhD</a>. “Reflective journaling is particularly beneficial for emotional release, processing feelings and thoughts, and reducing anxiety. It enhances self-awareness; as one writes, reads, and perhaps edits or adds to their entries, they create a psychological space between themselves and their thoughts and feelings. This process allows for framing experiences and opens the door for processing and reframing.”</p>



<p>Reassuring me that there are no set rules for how to journal “properly,” Love notes that “there are thousands of helpful ideas and prompts out there if you find yourself staring fruitlessly at a blank page.” </p>



<p>“The main thing is to ditch the guilt about achieving perfection,” she adds. “Even if all you do is write a single line, then that is totally OK.”</p>



<p>“Personal preference absolutely plays a role,” agrees Dr. Ben-Ari. “Some find it beneficial to write in the morning to set intentions and establish a positive mindset for the day, while others prefer journaling before bed, which helps in reflecting on the day and calming the mind for a good night’s sleep.”</p>



<p>With their advice in mind, I dug an unused notebook out from the back of a drawer, scoured the house for a pen (a fruitless task: I wound up buying a pack of biros at the corner shop), and positioned them artfully beside my bed.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Even if all you do is write a single line, then that is totally OK.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Reader, I won’t lie to you: I found it incredibly difficult to think of anything to write for the first few nights and mornings. The words of my university’s creative writing tutor rang in my ears, however — <em>just start writing, and the words will come </em>— and so that’s what I did. I wrote banal little sentences about my day: about what I’d eaten for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. About how delayed the trains had been. About the <em>weather</em> (how incredibly, painfully British of me). Unsurprisingly, I began to view the journaling as a chore to be ticked off, rather than as valuable time for myself. </p>



<p>This is normal: as humans, we are notoriously bad at <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/01/8903068/how-to-change-habits"">forging new habits</a>. In fact, research shows that 23% of people <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/why-new-years-resolutions-fail"">quit their resolutions</a> by the end of the first week, and <a href=""https://insideoutmastery.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/"">43% quit by the end of January</a>. “Like resolutions, you might start journaling with great intentions and goodwill, but find they often fade within a few weeks,” says Dr. Ben-Ari. “People might find it hard to stick to a journaling schedule, as it doesn’t offer the same benefits for everyone’s mental and emotional health.”</p>



<p>Thankfully, both of my experts had some tips on how to get more out of my tentative journaling experiment — in the hope that I might be able to keep the good habit in place for longer.</p>



<p>“Treat your journal as a private exploration space just for you and no one else,” suggests Love. “Take some time to reflect on your day, important events in your life, or decisions you’ve made. You might want to jot down anything you’re worried or bothered about. It can be helpful, too, to think about what has made you feel good or proud of yourself. And a letter to your past or future self can be a truly powerful experience.”</p>



<p>Dr. Ben-Ari, meanwhile, had another suggestion with regards to what to write. “In my clinic, I encourage clients to keep a dream journal, as dreams, which are easily forgotten, carry messages from our inner wisdom and unconscious,” she told me. “Writing them down serves three functions: remembering the dreams; learning about the dreams narratives and themes; and noticing the psychological shifts they reflect in therapy.”</p>



<p>I began taking a cup of chamomile tea up with me to bed and sipping it as I noted down all of my thoughts and feelings in a bid to make my head — and world — feel that little bit clearer. I’m the sort of socially anxious person who worries over every perceived slight, so I used my journal to explore these fears rather than lying awake obsessing over them. And, as someone whose inner critic is her biggest bully, it was genuinely lovely to take a moment each night to pay attention to the things I’d done well — no matter how small. </p>



<p>As time ticked on, I found myself looking forward to curling up in bed with my journal. And, as someone who usually spends a great deal of time tossing and turning and fretting before eventually plunging headfirst into a series of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/04/9659134/having-vivid-dreams-coronavirus"">anxiety-fueled dreams</a> (dreams which I’m now making a point of committing to paper, I hasten to add), I’m happy to report that I found myself falling asleep more quickly after journaling, too. The dreams have proven as erratic as ever, mind you, but I’m hoping that keeping this habit up will help to improve them over time. <br /><br />If I’m being completely honest, my inner cynic wanted this experiment to prove a failure. I’ve never been fond of elaborate morning and evening routines — especially when they reek of “wellbeing washing” — and all of the “click to buy” links on people’s social media made me assume it was nothing but a cash grab. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>As time ticked on, I found myself looking forward to curling up in bed with my journal. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>I also found that buying myself an extra-special sparkly notebook added a sense of occasion to proceedings, but anything will do the job in a pinch. All you really need is a few minutes each day: Yes, many people aim to write for 15 or 20 minutes, but starting small is honestly the best way to set a habit in motion (and, if you’re anything like me, you’ll find that you wind up writing more and more as the weeks tick by).</p>



<p>If you need some help getting started, Love suggests that you try something like “a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gratitude-journal-prompt-ideas"">‘gratitude journal’</a> and jot down three things you’re grateful for, or a ‘one sentence a day’ approach to help take the pressure off, particularly for those who find writing hard or are out of practice. “Writing about whatever events, thoughts or feelings that came up that day can be another simple entry point to journaling,” she adds.</p>



<p>Just one word of caution: While this activity has proven incredibly beneficial to many people, and while I myself have been won over, it’s important to pay attention to how the activity makes <em>you </em>feel. Everyone is different.</p>



<p>“Reflective journaling, when feeling overwhelmed, offers a space to make sense of experiences and feelings, helping to calm the mind,” says Dr. Ben-Ari. “However, I generally don’t recommend journaling ‘to-do lists’ as they can add stress or distract from deeper issues that need attention. Also, writing that dwells excessively on negative events or feelings, a process known as over-rumination, can lead to increased stress. Concerns about privacy can also impact the honesty needed for reflective journaling.”</p>



<p>Adding that “it’s also important to note that not everyone enjoys writing,” Ben-Ari notes that its benefits can still be reaped “through art, drawing or other creative means as a way to process feelings.” We just need to remember that it is a tool, and use it in a way that works best for us as individuals.</p>



<p>On that note, I’m off to bed — and, yes, you’d best believe I’ll be journaling about the experience of writing about journaling. Things are about to get incredibly meta…</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2021/09/10675277/coolest-tv-characters"">Sophie Turner</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/saltburn-emerald-fennell-interview"">Archie Madekwe’s</a> newest <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/amazon-prime-video"">Prime Video</a> show <em>Steal</em> centers around a major heist where billions of pounds are stolen from a London pension fund. Without giving any spoilers (there’s a <em>lot</em> of twists revealed throughout the show), the series broadly focuses on how much wealth in society is controlled by a small percentage of people, how it affects all of us workers in the capitalist regime, and what lengths people will go to for money.</p>



<p>Turner plays Zara, your regular office worker who barely earns a living wage while working at a swanky office in London’s wealthy financial district. The show depicts the fallout after thieves hold the office workers hostage and steal billions of pounds from people’s pensions. As Zara and her friend Luke (Madekwe) try to solve the mystery, things get complicated, and lives are at stake.</p>



<p>Madekwe tells <em>Refinery29</em> it’s “very dangerous” to have so much wealth controlled by so few people, which he believes <em>Steal </em>conveys well. “It’s incredibly prevalent right now… I think the show kind of explores that in a lot of ways, but of course, it’s awful,” the actor says. “I think people can relate to [the show]. I think everybody is feeling [stuck], you know? And everybody feels helpless, and there are people [who] could change the situation, and don’t… the disparity [in wealth] is huge, and it isn’t fair. And yeah, it’s anarchic.”</p>



<p>Turner adds that <em>Steal </em>shows how desperation, when it comes to money, can push people to the limit. “We’ve got too many billionaires and the cost-of-living crisis [means] the disparity is too big, and the gap’s got to close. I wish I could do something about it, but I just can’t,” she says. “But that’s what I like about the show, as well. It explores why good people do bad things, and it is for reasons like this. So that’s what I love, exploring that.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>We’ve got too many billionaires and the cost-of-living crisis [means] the disparity is too big, and the gap’s got to close.</p><cite>Sophie Turner</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>For Turner, she’s previously played fantasy characters like Sansa Stark (<em>Game of Thrones)</em>, Jean Grey (<em>X-Men: Apocalpyse</em>) and more recently, 1980s character Joan (<em>Joan</em>). It’s no surprise that for a show tackling topics like wealth inequality, her role as Zara in <em>Steal</em> hits closer to home, with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/emma-mackey-jamie-lee-curtis-ella-mccay-trauma"">family trauma</a>, a messy love life, and other relatable traits. But rather than missing an extravagant wardrobe or hours in makeup, she relished the chance to tell a story in a different way. “I don’t think I’ve ever played a character quite as messy as her and it was really fun because I felt like I could just show up.. it’s just very relieving when you don’t have to wear a corset and your shoulders aren’t pulled back, you don’t have to talk in a certain way,” Turner says. “I could just kind of flop about, I don’t know how else to explain it. I felt so free in playing her, I think that’s what I mean,” she adds. “[She’s the] closest to me as any character I’ve played.”</p>



<p>While her character Zara is more ordinary than most others she’s stepped into, being held at gunpoint is anything but. While you’d imagine being put through your paces by masked thieves would be taxing, Turner actually just saw that action-packed day as another day in the office… literally. “I really thrive on days when it is a high-stakes day where it’s a lot of drama and a lot of emotion, and I actually find it quite cathartic,” the actor says. “I go home feeling much better about myself than I did walking in. I think that’s what acting is for me, is therapy. I always feel better going home and it’s easy to step out of it.”</p>



<p>And even though the actors might not take home the anxiety or emotions from set, <em>Steal’s</em> fast-paced show could very well induce it in viewers. But Madekwe notes that’s the reason viewers watch heist shows in the first place. “It’s like fun, escapism,” he explains. “I always love [watching] things that make me kind of physically feel something. And if something gets your heart racing, kind of builds anxiety in that way like a show like this does, and you’re able to create that in your own home, then I think it’s so exciting. And this show, I think, really succeeds with that.”</p>



<p><em><strong>All six episodes of Steal will be able to stream on Amazon Prime Video on January 21, 2026.</strong></em><br /></p>

<p>From <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bob-haircut-trends-2026"">the bob</a> to the bixie, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/01/11843952/pixie-haircut-trends-2025"">short haircuts</a> have become the style of choice in salons up and down the country. Though they all look incredible, they’re also pretty high maintenance. </p>



<p>For those who don’t like the idea of booking in for a monthly trim, a midi, shoulder-length cut might be your best bet. Far from mediocre, the in-between length isn’t only much easier to keep sharp — it’s also being touted as one of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/haircut-trends-2026"">biggest hair trends for 2026</a>. “Mid-length cuts don’t have to feel like a long, grown-out bob,” says <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jordanoliverhair/"">Jordan Jones</a>, stylist and color technician at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/taylor_taylor_london/"">Taylor Taylor London</a>. “This year, we’re being shown that they can be their own style with layers and careful shaping to create volume and movement, or shine and sophistication. If your bob has grown out and your hair has reached that awkward-length stage, or if you’ve got long locks and fancy a change without going super short, a trendy mid-length style is the cut for you.”</p>



<p>On Instagram, London’s most sought-after stylists <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thehairbros/"">The Hair Bros</a> are also championing shoulder-length haircuts with curtain bangs, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/concave-layers-hair-trend"">concave layers</a>, and natural waves. It seems we’ve all got the same idea: Google search for shoulder-length haircuts has risen by 180% recently.</p>

<p>Curtain bangs are going nowhere fast, but according to editorial hairstylist and presenter <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/neilmoodie/?hl=en"">Neil Moodie</a>, you might want to cancel your fringe trim, because it’s increasingly cool to let it grow out a little. “Grown-out curtain fringes are great and can make shoulder-length hair look more interesting,” he says. The more grown out the fringe, the easier it is to blend into the rest of your hair, particularly if you’re interested in getting a handful of layers to enhance volume and texture, like this style by hairstylist <br /><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/nicolasfloreshair/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nicolas Flores</a>.</p>

<p>“As the bob and long bobs have been around for a while, I feel like fringes are making a comeback,” says Moodie. “The type of fringe I mean almost looks a bit homemade and very individual. It’s slightly jagged on the ends and a little uneven.” Take a cue from this choppy cut on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/callandevilliers/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Callan de Villiers</a> by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DOy1sLMjOE1/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cort Bray.</a> </p>

<p>You’ve heard of the wolf cut (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/sachel-haircut-trend-the-rachel"">a variation on the shag</a>, occupying a space between wild and relaxed) but ‘the mane’ is a lot more voluminous. “This is super edgy with lots of texture and a heavy fringe that needs to be worn long and in the eyes so it has plenty of movement,” explains <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jordanoliverhair/"">Jordan Jones</a>, stylist and color technician at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/taylor_taylor_london/"">Taylor Taylor London</a>. “The face-framing layers of this cut make it perfect for adding texture and volume to the hair while defining the face.”</p>



<p>So what should you ask for? “A choppy cut with plenty of layers that frame the face and create soft movement,” says Jones. “Think Billie Eilish and Miley Cyrus’s shaggy ‘dos.” Jones says the look works well with any hair texture. “Sea salt products are a must-have to give an effortless, freshly tousled finishing touch.” Take inspiration from this look by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/frankie_inv/"">Francesca Inverarity</a>.</p>

<p>“Another trend that will continue to be popular is the half-up, half-down style,” says Lorraine, “especially with hair extensions.” She continues: “You can add an ombre hair color to the ends and combine this with a natural, soft, body wave.” <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/gemmamurphyhair/"">Gemma Murphy</a> from <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dylanbradshawdublin/"">Dylan Bradshaw, Dublin</a>, totally nails the cute in-between style here.</p>

<p>“The collarbone cut is so popular right now,” says Tyler Moore, stylist at <a href=""https://livetruelondon.com/"">Live True London</a>. He prefers a blunt edge and no layering, but the look works equally well with a little bit of texture. “This style can be paired with a fringe for an ultra chic look, and it works great on both straight and wavy or textured hair.” We love this look on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DKVl2Isx1dr/?img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jessenia Robayo</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thehairbros/"">The Hair Bros</a> say a shoulder-length cut is its own style and that it’s important not to leave all of the hair one length. “This will end up looking heavy, as if it were a shorter bob. A middy haircut should be full of texture and life and feel fun and playful. It’s great for anyone who wants to cut their long hair short but isn’t quite ready to brave a bob.” Flip your hair to one side for more of a natural, lived-in feel, like this cut on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRkc3d-jAqf/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Alexia Colombo</a>. “As always, just a few products and some air should be enough to style this cut,” added The Hair Bros. </p>

<p>The ’90s lob (aka long bob) is going to be everywhere again this year, says Tyler. “This is a layered, mid-length long bob à la Rachel from <em>Friends</em>. Think of it as a more retro twist on the wolf cut with slightly longer layers and a sleeker texture.” Dreamed up by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/the.labartory?hl=en"">@the.labartory</a> on Instagram, this lob is both glossy and textured.</p>

<p>“Embrace modern glamour with a super blunt cut with clean, sharp lines,” says Jones, like this cut created by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DGCh4ufOwnt/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Emiliano Breit</a>. “This style looks best when cut around the collarbone and is perfectly set off with mirror-shine hair.” This is all about the condition of your hair, so make sure to use hydrating and nourishing conditioners or oils to create a super sleek style. <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fkerastase-elixir-ultime-refillable-hydrating-hair-oil-P511702"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kérastase Elixir Ultime L’Original Hair Oil</a>, is a favorite among stylists.</p>



<p>“If you are a brunette or darker, ask for a gloss color to add depth and shine,” adds Jones. “Even opting for a Brazilian blow-dry or straightening treatment will help to put the finishing touches on this look.”</p>

<p>“Why is shoulder-length hair commonly perceived to be bad?” wrote The Hair Bros on Instagram. “It’s not!” This modern shoulder-length cut by hairstylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/liamrussell.hair/"">Liam Russell</a> on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/didntcatchthat/"">Ruby Tuesday Evers</a> has inspired the Bros’ work in-salon over the past few months. The bedhead texture and mussed-up fringe give the medium length great shape.</p>

<p>The shag, the mullet, the shullet… Whatever you call the ‘00s most popular cut, it always seems to be evolving, as illustrated by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CXn-azRMw9R/"">Emily Kingston</a>, stylist and colorist at <a href=""https://bluetitlondon.com/salons/clapton/"">Blue Tit Clapton</a>. Proving the cut looks just as incredible on curly hair, the trick is to emphasize lots of volume around the top of the head and taper the lengths right down to the bottom so that hair sits just below the collarbone.</p>

<p>The flipped side bang perfectly accentuates a shoulder-length cut, says Jones, like this style on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DGgb_HuORC3/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Billie Brown</a>. “Curtain bangs have moved on, and side bangs from the early ’00s are back. For fringe lovers who want a bit more excitement this year, this style flatters most face shapes and essentially frames the face with disconnected, slightly longer bangs. It’s not dramatic and easy to tuck behind your ear, pin to one side, or sweep across the forehead with a big, bouncy blow-dry.”</p>



<p>Jones says it looks great on wavy, thicker hair in particular, styled as if it’s been casually flipped over. “To keep it on trend, it’s best worn loose and tousled. Add spritzes of dry shampoo on the roots for second-day hair to amplify the volume and add a bit of texture.”</p>

<p>Until a few weeks ago, I was faithfully using a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tretinoin-skin-benefits-risks"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">prescription retinoid</a> recommended by a trusted dermatologist — and my skin had never looked worse. My first mistake was assuming that, having <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glow-recipe-blackberry-retinol-blemish-serum-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">used retinol before</a>, I wouldn’t experience the harsh side effects of a stronger formula. But when my skin wouldn’t stop peeling, my breakouts got worse, and I was almost out of the tube, I knew something was off. So when The Inkey List’s new <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fadvanced-retinol-us-P520381%3F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Advanced 0.2% Retinal</a> landed on my desk, promising a fast yet gentle experience for retinoid users, I knew I had to give it a try. </p>



<h2>What is The Inkey List’s Advanced 0.2% Retinal, and what are the benefits? </h2>



<p>Without getting all lab-coat on you (and before I get into the nitty gritty), it helps to know the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">difference between retin<em>al</em> </a>— the star ingredient in The Inkey List’s new serum — and retin<em>ol</em>. Both are members of the retinoid family, but they work a little differently.  </p>



<p>Esthetician <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/alicia.lartey/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Alicia Lartey</a> previously explained to R29 that when retinol is applied to the skin, it <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">goes through several steps</a> before being converted into retinoic acid, which triggers all the amazing skin benefits, like improving texture and tone, minimizing fine lines by boosting collagen production, and reducing breakouts by renewing skin cells. Retinal, on the other hand, requires fewer steps to become retinoic acid, so it works faster — 11 times faster, according to The Inkey List. It’s the retinal that gives this serum its striking yellow color, but don’t worry — it hasn’t gone bad, and though it’s a little reminiscent of a turmeric face mask, it absorbs instantly and won’t stain your skin. I can vouch for that.  </p>

<h2>What makes The Inkey List’s Advanced 0.2 Retinal special? </h2>



<p>Even better, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP520381"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Inkey List’s retinal</a> is encapsulated, meaning it’s wrapped in tiny moisturizing molecules that release it gradually into the skin. This way, you get all the benefits of a high-powered ingredient with far less irritation — no soreness or painfully dry, flaky patches here.  </p>



<p>Just when I thought this product couldn’t get any smarter, it also features 1% symsitive, a soothing ingredient that supports the skin barrier (the outer layer that keeps moisture in and bacteria out). This is a relief, as retinoids can easily damage the skin barrier if used incorrectly or too often. Plus, there’s 2% sirtalice, an algae-derived ingredient that helps firm the skin in minutes, making it appear juicy and plump.  </p>

<h2>How do you use The Inkey List’s Advanced 0.2 Retinal, and is it worth it?  </h2>



<p>I’ve been using <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP520381"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Advanced 0.2% Retinal</a> for a few weeks now (a pea-sized amount three nights a week, right after cleansing and before a simple moisturizer), and my skin is already much happier. It’s clearer, bouncier, smoother in texture, and more even in tone, thanks to the retinal helping minimize the red marks left behind by breakouts. Here, I’m wearing a light touch of concealer and blush, and can comfortably skip foundation.</p>



<p>With my skin feeling less dry, the fine lines under my eyes and across my forehead have eased up, too. I even bring it down my neck to help zap the occasional hormonal zit. My neck is the first place to feel sensitive when I use retinoids because the skin is thinner here, but so far, I’ve not experienced any irritation. </p>



<p>It’s a lightweight serum, so you’ll want to make sure the moisturizer you apply on top in the evening is fairly simple and doesn’t contain high-strength actives like exfoliating acids. Good options include <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fsos-daily-skin-barrier-redness-recovery-moisturizer-P506470"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tower 28 SOS Daily Skin Barrier Redness Recovery Moisturizer</a> or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fthe-ordinary-deciem-natural-moisturizing-factors-ha-P427414"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + Hyaluronic Acid</a>. I’m also a fan of <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fthe-inkey-list-bio-active-ceramide-repairing-plumping-moisturizer-P509315"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Inkey List’s Bio-Active Ceramide Repairing and Plumping Moisturizer</a>. </p>





<p>My top tip for anyone using this serum is to continue using a high-factor, broad-spectrum sunscreen in the daytime because retinoids make skin more sensitive to sunlight. Yep, even in the fall and winter months. </p>



<p>You can always count on The Inkey List not to leave anyone out, and there’s good news for retinoid beginners, too. Alongside its buzzy new retinal, the brand has also unveiled a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fstarter-retinol-us-P520372"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Starter Retinol Serum</a>, just as affordable at $14. With 1% granactive retinoid (a gentler, also encapsulated form) and 0.01% retinal, it’s kinder on sensitive skin — even for those with rosacea — thanks to additional soothing ingredients like glycerin and symrelief 100 (made from chamomile and ginger root). While it’s pretty new, the five-star reviews speak for themselves. </p>

<p>Hair artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tomsmithhd/?hl=en"">Tom Smith</a> describes the varsity bob as a choppy, chin-skimming cut with subtle layers and a center part. The inspo? <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stxph.h/?hl=en"">Steph Hui</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/milliebobbybrown/?hl=en"">Millie Bobby Brown</a>. “Polished but never prissy, it carries a cool collegiate energy — youthful without being childish and preppy without being stiff,” says Smith. While the movement might look undone, it’s actually intentional and well-maintained, adds Smith, thanks to the invisible layers through the mid-lengths and ends that create that flicky volume.</p>

<p>“Gucci bangs feel very fashion-forward — and powerful,” says celebrity hairstylist and colorist, Dimitris Giannetos. He recalls creating the softly-parted, slightly grown-out look for <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPCbqhRCcFf/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Demi Moore</a> ahead of her role as the fictional character Barbara Gucci in the short film <a href=""https://www.gucci.com/uk/en_gb/ms/short-film/video/?srsltid=AfmBOoqmlK5X6LGynFA07QzQ_cV-MEN9asH5aMoAgw1q-0w5QmEfs8ve""><em>The Tiger</em></a><em>.</em> “To achieve this look, ask for wispy curtain bangs just below the brows with face-framing pieces towards the ears,” recommends Giannetos. The key? “Avoid a blunt cut by adding some variety to the length of the bangs across the face,” he says.</p>

<p>“<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRwqKtLkWkX/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Anok Yai</a>’s striking short bob, complete with a blunt fringe, highlights the boldness of this style,” says celebrity hairdresser <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lorraine_dublin/?hl=en"">Lorraine Dublin</a>. “It’s a sharp, chin-skimming bob paired with a clean fringe, and it’s set to stand out this winter.” Why? It has a strong, modern silhouette, Dublin explains, yet still feels polished and low-maintenance.

The ripped bob, however, is a more interesting, layered take, thanks to softly separated ends created with a texturizing technique where the hair is chopped into vertically.

<p>The shag is set to take on a much gentler image in 2026, according to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/neale.rodger/?hl=en"">Neale Rodger</a>, style director at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stil.salon/reels/?hl=en"">STIL salon</a> in London. “Think soft, feathered layers that build volume and create easy movement,” says Rodger, like this look by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DQ8UfaOEZwa/?hl=en"">Ryenne Snow</a>. Rodger adds that it’s the kind of cut that still looks intentional even as it grows out. “It’s a brilliant choice for medium to thick hair,” continues Rodger, “especially if there’s already some natural wave or texture to play with.” Guiding your stylist is simple: “Ask for feathered layers throughout, soft ends, and a length that sits somewhere between the neck and shoulders,” advises Rodger.</p>

<p>The ’70s have had their time in the sun. Now, it’s 1960’s time to shine, and bangs are leading the resurgence, says <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/rickyandthe64/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ricky Walters</a>, founder and creative director of <a href=""https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/kDPwCAD7OkS1gz3BSGfnFGBjS0?domain=instagram.com"">Salon 64</a>. “The new incarnation is all about boldness: think thick, heavy, statement-making fringes taken surprisingly far back into the crown,” says Walters. He adds, “This isn’t a whisper of a fringe; it’s a full-volume curtain that instantly reshapes the face, adding drama, mystery, and a touch of French-girl rebellion.” Walters says that cutting it with plenty of density — adding bulk through techniques like point cutting and texturizing — prevents it from slipping into anything too dated. Hairstylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRgiqAzkYj5/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Ryenne Snow</a> always nails it.</p>

<p>The power pixie has <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DKC7SdkIV8j/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Florence Pugh</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/glennclose/?hl=en"">Glenn Close</a>, and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lirisaw/?hl=en"">Iris Law</a> to thank for its meteoric rise. “This is a cropped, layered pixie that’s sharp, sculpted, and deliberately androgynous,” says Smith. Its key characteristics? “Enough length and the top and front to allow for versatile styling,” adds Smith, who calls it the ultimate anti-blowout style. “This is great for finer hair types and those who want more lift, as it helps to contour the jawline and cheekbones when long enough to be tucked behind the ears,” says Smith. Asking for it couldn’t be simpler: “Ask for close layering and texture that can shift from matte and punkish by day to polished and glossy at night,” advises Smith — and don’t forget the longer, swooping bangs.</p>

<p>The name sounds complicated, but the result speaks for itself. It’s essentially a soft blowout with rounded, bouncy ends, explains Giannetos, who recently debuted the look on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPfNBxrAm_i/?img_index=1"">Amal Clooney</a>. “It works well on long, layered hair, about 6-8 inches from the shoulder. This look enhances body, adds movement, and makes the blowout feel thicker and more voluminous,” says Giannetos. “I like to take a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbioionic.com%2Fproducts%2Flong-barrel-curling-iron%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOop4ikEqvaTUTaxG4jDAYCjJnatn52afqSSXogJ4hCj1l_BzoThO"">1.25” Bio Ionic Curler</a> to the ends to lock in the rounded shape.”</p>

<p>The shaggy bob is not only effortlessly chic, says Dublin, but it’s practical for winter and spring. “The layers add movement and texture — great under scarves or hats — while still looking polished for work or evening plans,” adds Dublin. Grab a hydrating hair cream like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fpalo-santo-styling-cream-for-curly-coily-hair-P514454"">PATTERN by Tracee Ellis Ross Palo Santo Styling Cream</a> and let your natural texture do its thing.

<p>Mussed-up texture is in this season, says Stenson, and while the classic shag’s layering technique is making a comeback, it’s being reimagined for 2026 with modern softness and volume. “Even better, it’s flexible across hair types,” he adds. “A shag is great for anyone with thick hair because it removes weight and bulk. If you have finer hair, ask for a modern micro-shag or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/07/10604094/wolf-cut-hair-style"">wolf-shag</a> with strategic layering that adds volume and texture without making the hair look sparse,” advises Stenson. This <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/Cs24C3GoX3u/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">cut on Linasha</a> never fails to inspire. </p>

<p>“The textured lob [aka long bob] will continue its quiet takeover,” says Rodger. “It’s mid-length, slightly undone, and effortlessly cool — the kind of cut that behaves beautifully through winter,” he adds. It’s also a seasonal all-rounder, and easy to air-dry in the warmer months, too. “I love how it slips under scarves and coats without losing shape, and it gives hair that natural, lived-in movement,” continues Rodger, who says it’s perfect for wavy and lightly curly hair. “Ask your stylist for a neck-to-shoulder graze with feathered, textured ends, and a soft, natural finish,” suggests Rodger.

<p>The 2026 update is lighter than its previous counterpart, says Walters, and it sits in what he refers to as the magic zone: “Just above the collarbone and never shorter than the jawline,” adds Walters, like this cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DL7RI9nTj3h/?img_index=1"">Miho Mai</a>. “This sweet spot creates a clean, graphic silhouette without sacrificing softness.” What gives it a modern edge is the invisible layering: “These are subtle, sliced-in shorter pieces hidden underneath,” says Walters. “These secret layers act like built-in movement, allowing the bob to swing, breathe, and catch the light in all the right ways.”</p>

<p>If they’re not cut properly, curtain bangs can look blocky and unnatural, failing to blend into the rest of your lengths. That’s why Stenson suggests asking for “texturized” curtain bangs. Texturized bangs are cut with techniques that soften the fringe and remove bulk, so they fall more naturally. “Your stylist will assess the density of your hair to ensure your bangs are proportionate to your face,” says Stenson. “Bangs are especially a great choice for those with fine or thin hair and looking to bring some volume to their look. They’re truly versatile enough to suit all face shapes.” Take inspiration from this cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DHXGOA8RxGH/?hl=en"">@charlottexstyles</a> on Instagram.</p>

<p>The bixie — bob meets pixie — is heading into 2026 with us, and for good reason: it’s soft, wearable, and short enough to feel fresh, says Rodger. “This is a sweet spot between a bob and a pixie, and it’s ideal for anyone tempted to go shorter without committing to a full pixie,” says Rodger. He adds that it works especially well on fine to medium hair, which always benefits from added texture through the mid-lengths and ends. “When you’re asking for it in the chair, think chin length or slightly above, with light, choppy layers and a soft, airy finish.” We love this crop by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DKmqHaSxsQ2/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Chellsie Aiger Serrano</a>.</p>

<p>Rodger is convinced that a “clean, blunt bob” is the answer to feeling polished without the effort, like this cut on STIL client <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DJcGcLqIu_E/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Abbie de Fontaine</a>. “The strong, even line gives you instant structure,” he says. “Plus, it looks incredible peeking out from under winter and spring layers.” He adds that the cut is particularly beautiful on slightly wavy or straight, finer hair, as it lends weight and sharpness. For the best result, Rodger suggests asking for a chin-to-collarbone bob with crisp, blunt ends and minimal layering. “Keep it sleek or lightly textured depending on your hair type,” he says.</p>
