The simple fire pit was one of humanity's earliest spatial devices: a place for warmth, food, storytelling, and ritual. Around it, space took shape through proximity rather than enclosure, through shared presence rather than prescribed use. The fire organized bodies in a circle, fostered alliances, and turned survival into collective life. Today, this ancestral logic persists: architecture has the potential of bringing people together not by commanding how they gather, but by creating the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1037387/architecture-that-shapes-health-lessons-of-design-and-well-being-in-2025?ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=search_result_articles"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">conditions that make togetherness possible</a>.</p>",

<p>Lotus Clubhouse was conceived as a living organism that breathes in harmony with the terrain and surrounding natural environment. Rather than standing as an isolated architectural object, the building appears to emerge from the ground itself, shaped by natural slopes, layers of vegetation, and its orientation toward the lake. From the earliest design stages, the project was defined as a continuous dialogue between architecture, landscape, and local context. As a result, the boundaries between built form and nature gradually dissolve, allowing the clubhouse to exist simultaneously as architecture and landscape, a place of shelter for people and an extended habitat for nature.</p>",

<p>The Porcelain Source Museum is located on the former site of Longsheng Village in Deqing County, Zhejiang Province. To the north of the site are the remains of primitive porcelain kilns dating from the Shang through the Warring States periods, while a small river runs along the southern edge, spanned by the Wukang Shishe Bridge, originally constructed during the Yuan dynasty. Within the site, portions of the original village dwellings have been preserved, reconstructed, or adapted and incorporated into the museum's exhibition spaces, serving as thematic galleries or support facilities, thereby allowing elements of the site's historical fabric to be sustained. The main body of the museum is composed of two parts. One part extends longitudinally along the riverbank, adopting a rectilinear plan while presenting an overall architectural form of an organic character.</p>",

<p>Urban Sparkle transforms a restaurant site in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/ho-chi-minh-city"">Ho Chi Minh City</a> into a luminous urban beacon through an origami-inspired steel roof that captures and refracts light throughout the day. Located along a 30-meter street frontage in Thao Dien, the project sits directly in front of Ho Chi Minh City's first metro line while surrounded by high-rise residential towers. This creates a unique visibility condition where the building is viewed from three distinct elevations—street level, passing trains, and tower windows above.</p>",

<p>Located in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/lagoa-santa"">Lagoa Santa</a>, in the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte, Casa Tangram sits on a gently sloping plot by the edge of a lake. <strong>The house is positioned at the highest point of the lot, so from the street, it appears as a discreet horizontal line, almost blending with the horizon.</strong> Walls, slopes, and the built volume itself form a visual barrier to the outside. Upon entering, one quickly realizes that the street disappears: from inside the house, only trees, the lawn, and water are visible.</p>",

<p>The project concerns the renovation and extension of a townhouse with a basement, two above-ground floors, and an attic. The existing enclosed rear extensions were structurally unsound and obstructed the relationship with the outdoor space, resulting in limited daylight on the rear of the ground floor. The client wished to improve daylight penetration and strengthen the connection with the garden.</p>",

<p>On the southern edge of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/vienna"">Vienna</a>, a cluster of monumental terraces rises above the cityscape, their stepped balconies cascading with greenery and their rooftops crowned with swimming pools. This is the Wohnpark Alterlaa, one of the most ambitious social housing projects in postwar Europe. Designed by Austrian architect Harry Glück and built between 1973 and 1985, the complex was founded on a provocative principle: <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/963912/we-already-have-viable-models-for-quality-affordable-housing"">municipal housing</a> should not only provide affordable shelter but also offer the pleasures and amenities usually reserved for the wealthy.</p>",

<h4>What actually goes into a good prompt, and why most advice skips this</h4><figure><img alt=""Illustration of hands holding binoculars with eyes, looking at a floating photo of a person."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RNqin4edZ02x53nGTpedjw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>If you’re trying to learn how to write good Figma Make prompts, you’ve probably hit the same wall I did.</p><p>Most advice stays abstract.<br /><em>Be clear. Add context. Explain intent.</em></p><p>None of that helps when you’re staring at an empty prompt box wondering what actually needs to go in there.</p><p>What’s missing in the industry right now isn’t more frameworks. It’s <strong>real examples</strong>. <em>Full prompts.</em> End-to-end inputs you can actually read and learn from.</p><p>By the end of this post, you should have a clearer sense of what actually belongs in a Figma Make prompt, based on <strong>real inputs that already work</strong>.</p><p>Instead of inventing yet another framework, I looked at what already exists. I studied real inputs, tested them, and compared the results. This post documents that process using <strong>real prompts, real tradeoffs, and real constraints</strong>.</p><p>If you’re new to Figma Make, this will help you get unstuck. If you’ve already used it, this will help you waste fewer prompts.</p><h3>TL;DR</h3><p>Most Figma Make advice is vague. It tells you to <em>“add context”</em> without showing what a good prompt actually looks like.</p><p>This post breaks down <strong>three real approaches designers are already using</strong> to write Figma Make prompts:</p><ul><li>using a PRD as the prompt</li><li>translating loose inputs into Make-ready instructions</li><li>pressure-testing intent with a simple checklist</li></ul><p>Instead of frameworks, this post shows <strong>full prompts end to end</strong>, including the <em>tradeoffs, time cost, and limitations</em> that come with them. The goal isn’t better prompts for their own sake. It’s <strong>fewer reruns, clearer intent, and workflows that still hold up</strong> as these tools become more constrained and more expensive.</p><p>If you only read one section, read <em>Applying this in practice</em>.</p><h3>Why focus on prompts at all?</h3><p>There are a lot of <a href=""https://youtu.be/9Y2Yz-ir3JM?si=OdP19cX5G_KxycwT"">ways to use Figma Make</a>. You can begin with simple inputs like images or existing files, then move into more advanced options such as the Point-and-Edit tool, connecting a library (organization and enterprise plans only), or editing code.</p><p>This post focuses on <strong>prompt writing</strong> because it offers the most leverage. From a blank canvas, you can create something surprisingly robust, including a <strong>working prototype</strong>. The ability to <em>build from scratch, clearly and intentionally</em>, is going to be in high demand.</p><h3>Three approaches worth studying</h3><p>Each of these comes from a respected voice in the industry and reflects a <strong>real way people are already working with Figma Make</strong>. I’m using them as concrete examples to break down what goes into an effective prompt, then translating those lessons into a <strong>real, actionable prompt</strong> you can study and edit yourself.</p><figure><img alt=""E-commerce cart page prototype generated from a PRD-based Figma Make prompt"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jveEH8DMXsq1KraXCEr0eQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>E-commerce cart prototype generated from a PRD-based Figma Make prompt</figcaption></figure><h3>1. Product requirements document (PRD)</h3><p>This example comes from a <a href=""https://youtu.be/EUPbdk972JI?si=xojfXzYqwVfEFNbe""><strong>YouTube video</strong></a><strong> by Jesse Showalter</strong> of Design Champs and uses a PRD as the prompt itself.</p><p>A PRD, or <strong>product requirements document</strong>, is a written description of what you’re trying to build. It lays out what the screen does, how it behaves, the rough layout, key states, and constraints like responsiveness or accessibility. It’s not a visual artifact. It’s a <em>thinking artifact</em>.</p><p>What makes this example valuable isn’t just the output. It’s the <strong>input</strong>.</p><p>The video doesn’t share the <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1diXC36YL9u1wd2hw40oi4N98gvp5xnjaUe7nOomr_EU/edit?usp=sharing""><strong>full prompt text</strong></a>, but I tracked it down and included it so you can read it end to end. Being able to see the entire prompt makes it much easier to understand <em>why</em> the result works and what kind of detail actually carries weight.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/664cd3ac21e30bb8ce1528cf52f9a374/href"">https://medium.com/media/664cd3ac21e30bb8ce1528cf52f9a374/href</a><p>When I reused that same prompt, it produced a solid, <a href=""https://legal-mosaic-22940652.figma.site""><strong>interactive prototype</strong></a> for a clothing store experience that I could copy back into Figma and continue iterating on. That’s what made the PRD powerful. <strong>It could be reused, and it produced consistent results.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Color palette prototype created from a prompt generated by the Make Prompt Assistant (custom GPT)."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FSXsKlc4qrviP2N1CmxwnQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Color palette prototype created from a prompt generated by the Make Prompt Assistant (custom GPT).</figcaption></figure><h3>2. Make Prompt Assistant</h3><p>The <strong>Make Prompt Assistant</strong> is a <strong>custom GPT available in ChatGPT</strong>, created by <strong>Greg Huntoon</strong>, a Design Manager at Figma.</p><p>What makes this approach useful is how quickly it gets you unstuck. You can start with something loose, like <em>“create a website inspired by coolors.co,”</em> and it will generate a <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wBUKRv7qUtIL2FlhWJjFjHLEgR-xEsVylHdKpFp3itA/edit?usp=sharing""><strong>structured prompt</strong></a> you can hand directly to Figma Make.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/35c2b2c7e3de8eef91a455841b8f49d2/href"">https://medium.com/media/35c2b2c7e3de8eef91a455841b8f49d2/href</a><p>This approach isn’t as robust as writing a prompt from scratch. You give up some flexibility because you’re not explicitly defining every decision. The assistant fills in gaps for you, which means <strong>some intent is inferred rather than specified</strong>.</p><p>The resulting prototype is a <em>solid starting point</em>. It provides structure and momentum, but it still needs refinement. That’s expected. This works best as a <strong>first pass</strong>, not a single, fully defined prompt.</p><p><strong>Core prompt structure</strong>:</p><ul><li>Task: what to build or change</li><li>Context: where it lives in the product</li><li>Elements: literal UI components</li><li>Behavior: interactions, states, logic</li><li>Constraints: device, layout, rules</li></ul><h3>3. TOKEN framework</h3><p>The <a href=""https://medium.com/ux-planet/a-practical-prompting-guide-for-figma-make-eb72f78ff1ce""><strong>TOKEN framework</strong></a> comes from <strong>Nick Babich</strong>, Product Designer and Editor-in-Chief of <strong>UX Planet</strong>, and was originally published on Medium.</p><p>TOKEN is the most explicit about structure. Rather than telling you to <em>“be clear,”</em> it defines what clarity actually means by naming the categories prompts often miss.</p><p>It doesn’t guarantee a good result, but it <strong>significantly reduces the chance that something important is missing</strong> from the first prompt.</p><p>I don’t think of TOKEN as a rigid script. I use it as a <em>pressure check</em> before handing control over to Make.</p><p>TOKEN stands for:</p><ul><li>Task: what exactly do you want the AI to do</li><li>Output: what should the final result look like</li><li>Key design elements: what must be included</li><li>Expected behaviors: how it responds to interaction</li><li>Notable constraints: platform, accessibility, brand, or technical rules</li></ul><h3>What these approaches have in common</h3><p>All three approaches required knowing what you wanted to <strong>build</strong> and having a clear sense of how it should function, what it should look like, and whether there were existing examples to pull from.</p><p>None of them worked well without that clarity up front. Before Make could produce anything useful, the <strong>decisions were already in place</strong>.</p><p>Across all three, prompts improved once these basics were settled:</p><ul><li>what was being built</li><li>what it was for</li><li>how it should behave</li><li>which constraints mattered</li></ul><p>When those decisions weren’t settled, prompts became harder to write and outputs became less predictable. Prompting didn’t resolve that uncertainty. <em>It surfaced it.</em></p><h3>How they differ in structure and intent</h3><p>Where these approaches differ is <strong>how and when those decisions get made</strong>.</p><p>Using a PRD pushes nearly all of the decision-making up front. You define intent explicitly, which gives you the most control and makes it possible for a single prompt to carry a lot of weight. The tradeoff is effort. Writing that level of clarity takes time.</p><p>The Make Prompt Assistant shifts some of that work to the tool. It’s useful when you have a loose idea or reference and want to get moving quickly, but some intent is inferred rather than specified. Refinement happens through iteration rather than a single, fully defined prompt.</p><p>TOKEN doesn’t create intent at all. It acts as a checkpoint. It’s most useful right before you run a prompt, when you want to verify that nothing important has been missed.</p><p>Once a design already exists, <strong>short, targeted prompts tend to outperform any framework</strong>. One change. One target.</p><figure><img alt=""Prototype created by applying a PRD-inspired prompt shaped by the techniques explored in this article."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KOEOPQIVS2zeUMGanM8kuQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Prototype created by applying a PRD-inspired prompt shaped by the techniques explored in this article.</figcaption></figure><h3>Applying this in practice</h3><p>After studying these approaches, I applied them to a real use case to see what actually held up.</p><p>I used a marketplace browsing experience similar to Etsy because it reflects the kind of work many designers deal with day to day. Search, filters, product grids, seller identity, favorites, responsive behavior, and accessibility are all common requirements on real product teams. This wasn’t a demo scenario. It was something I could realistically see a team needing to prototype.</p><p>I set one constraint up front: <strong>one prompt, no edits</strong>.</p><p>The goal wasn’t to keep nudging Make until it behaved. It was to push as much decision-making as possible into the prompt itself and see whether a single input could produce a functional result without follow-up corrections. The prototype mattered, but <strong>the real focus was the prompt</strong>.</p><p>For comparison, a previous <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/i-built-a-game-app-in-figma-make-41c54b89fd7f"">Figma Make game app</a> project I built completely from scratch took around <strong>680 prompts over four days</strong>. This experiment took closer to <strong>40 prompts and about eight hours</strong>. The difference wasn’t UI complexity. It was <strong>how much structure existed before Make ever ran</strong>.</p><p>Getting to a <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LuUpmb4H52zfvORxAH2AQ8fLrxyncsFR2fPT1O-orT8/edit?usp=sharing""><strong>single prompt</strong></a> that could generate a fully functioning prototype without edits was time-consuming. Each prompt run took roughly <strong>10 to 15 minutes</strong>, and as the prompt grew longer, Make would sometimes skip over details that were already written. That meant certain requirements had to be reinforced more than once.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/7a31f61c7fa063786f6175e058325526/href"">https://medium.com/media/7a31f61c7fa063786f6175e058325526/href</a><p>In practice, those gaps were easy to fix by asking Make to review the prompt again and adjust specific areas. But that wasn’t the experiment. The experiment was to see <strong>how far a one-pass prompt could realistically go on its own</strong>.</p><p><em>I didn’t fully reach that goal.</em></p><p>In some runs, the prompt produced exactly what I asked for. In others, small but important things broke or behaved inconsistently. Filters didn’t respond as expected. Menu states worked in one run and failed in another. Hover text occasionally rendered unreadable. None of these issues were hard to fix with additional prompting, but needing to fix them at all was the point. <strong>The variability mattered</strong>.</p><p>Based on this work, I don’t think Figma Make is consistently there yet. It’s close, but <strong>not reliable enough to guarantee that outcome every time</strong>.</p><p>To be honest, this was frustrating. <strong>Figma Make is an innovative tool</strong> and a clear signal of where design workflows are headed, but it still feels closer to a beta product than a finished one. It’s powerful for prototyping and exploration, but there’s work left to be done, especially as it moves toward a <a href=""https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/33459875669015-How-AI-credits-work""><strong>credit-based model</strong></a>. Being charged for prompts that <strong>fail, drift, or ignore requirements</strong> is a real concern.</p><p>At the same time, I don’t think this is a static system. Figma has a strong track record of iterating quickly, and I expect many of these rough edges to improve as Make matures. Even so, the direction is clear. <strong>Prompting is becoming part of day-to-day design work</strong>, and cost will increasingly be tied to <strong>how clearly intent is defined up front</strong>.</p><p>That’s why <strong>understanding how to write clear, effective prompts matters now</strong>. This isn’t about perfection. It’s about being prepared for how design workflows are changing and what that change will cost.</p><p>I wrote this because I couldn’t find the article I wanted when I started. One that showed <em>real prompts, real tradeoffs, and real constraints</em>.</p><p>If this helps you approach prompting with more confidence and intention, it did its job.</p><h3>References</h3><ul><li>Showalter, Jesse. <em>Using Figma Make to Go From Nothing to Interactive Prototypes</em>.

<h4>A story from the field: the day safeguarding became real</h4><figure><img alt=""Laptop, phone and book chained together, symbolising safeguarding and data security in user research fieldwork.

Source: Pexels.</figcaption></figure><p>During a discovery project, I was visiting education settings across England to run in‑person research. That meant working inside real-world constraints: safeguarding processes, visitor protocols, staff availability, young people moving through corridors, rooms that suddenly became unavailable, and the constant awareness that you’re a guest in someone else’s environment.</p><p>At one site, we were told (almost casually) that more than half the staff were off sick with COVID, and another bug was doing the rounds. The cherry on top was that we were crammed into a small basement room that was colder than the rest of the building, so no ventilation, and a very high chance of catching whatever was circulating.</p><p>Two days later, I was ill. I stayed ill for weeks. I couldn’t take sick leave due to tight deadlines and stakeholders picking on any leave taken as “delaying the project”.</p><p>That was my reminder that:</p><blockquote>Safeguarding isn’t only about what happens <strong>in</strong> the session. It’s also about what happens <strong>around</strong> the session: infection risk, travel load, lone working, fatigue, access, and the logistics nobody puts on the Gantt chart, including allowance for sick leave.</blockquote><p>And if you think that’s “just wellbeing” …well, it isn’t. It’s research quality. When researchers are depleted, rushed, anxious about getting to the next site, or taking avoidable health risks, the work gets worse. Decision-making gets shakier, debriefs get skipped, boundaries blur, and the conditions for ethical, high-quality research quietly erode.</p><p>The safeguarding plan template I share with you (at the end of this article) is informed by what I now call “interesting” field notes (though at the time, they were mildly psychosis‑inducing events!). I’m sharing 7 field notes to set the stage for why (and I cannot emphasise this enough) a safeguarding plan really matters.</p><h4>Field note #1: the invisible entrance</h4><p>On one visit, I arrived at what looked like a massive establishment, but couldn’t find the entrance. Construction work, temporary buildings, and exactly zero signposting added to the pain. I spent the first 15 minutes convincing myself I’d come to the wrong place, while my Uber driver (now a distant memory) had left me in what felt like a no-man’s-land.</p><p>I rechecked Google Maps like 50 times, reread my emails and tried contacting the reception by calling but no luck.</p><p>Eventually, a stranger appeared, also going to the same place, pointed me to the entrance like a human “you are here” sign. It was like going through a maze!</p><p>No one had done anything malicious in this case. I’d sent confirmation emails. They’d replied. We’d all behaved like professionals. But nobody had thought to say:</p><blockquote>“Entrance is currently around the back, follow the temporary fencing and come through the metal gates where all the clinical waste bins are lined up, and ignore the sign that lies.”</blockquote><p>It wasn’t their “fault”. It was the assumption that got me. I did not treat basic navigation and access as part of safeguarding. The fix, is boring and brilliant:</p><blockquote>Ask for <strong>photos of the entrance</strong>, a <strong>named contact with a mobile number</strong>, and a plan for what happens if you can’t get in within 10 minutes.</blockquote><figure><img alt=""Building entrance hidden behind construction work (scaffolding) and confusing signage.

Source: Pexels.</figcaption></figure><h4>Field note #2: the lone working</h4><p>When I was a PhD researcher, my office was in what was called “the Pink Building.” A large, light‑pink shed on campus. It had the architectural charm of a storage unit and the safety profile of, let’s say, “optimistic”.</p><p>One evening, we were preparing for a large-scale randomised controlled trial. We were printing and packing hundreds of consent forms, participant information sheets, and supporting documentation (ethical approval, what you need to know etc.). The kind of admin tasks that convinces you that your PhD is mainly an advanced qualification in stapling and packing envelopes.</p><p>Due to the looming deadline, I stayed late. A few others stayed late too.</p><p>At some point, without noticing, I became the last person in the building. And for some reason the main door would not open. I was stuck, and it was way past lone‑working hours. There were no CCTV cameras inside the building, and the dread of my supervisor finding out (and then them getting in trouble) was doing a lovely little duet with my panic response.</p><p>I called a friend who lived nearby. Luckily, they were home and they came and got me out.</p><p>Weeks later, I found out a different office in that same building had caught fire because a student smoked inside a wooden shed and left a still‑lit cigarette butt in a bin full of paper. The fire alarm did its job (thankfully). However, the final-year PhD student’s work couldn’t be rescued.</p><p>I’m sharing this because it’s the most predictable safeguarding lesson in academia (and beyond):</p><blockquote>Lone working isn’t a badge of honour. It’s a risk that needs a plan.</blockquote><h4>Field note #3: the re‑traumatisation</h4><p>Now for the one that still makes my eye twitch.</p><p>There was an opening event for a trial involving eating disorders. An influencer with lived experience was invited (paid to attend by public funding!). A media presence was expected. The senior investigator bragged about having “useful connections” in high places (because nothing says “scientific rigour” like name‑dropping your minister cousin).</p><p>Thank goodness the broadcaster didn’t show up, and neither did the “very important cousin”.</p><p>But what did happen was worse in a quieter way: there were clearly people in the room being impacted by the choices made around food, messaging, and the theatre of it all. It was a masterclass in how a team can be so focused on “PR” that they lose sight of basic emotional safety.</p><p>Putting large quantities of food and drinks in front of people (including the influencer herself) was not thoughtful. It was triggering for many because they were there due to lived experience of battling severe eating disorders that included <strong>anorexia, bulimia and so on</strong>… and then you have staff enthusiastically eating and drinking through it all.</p><p>That experience sharpened a point I now say out loud in project kick-offs:</p><blockquote>You can have all the ethics paperwork in the world. If your team culture treats re‑traumatisation as an abstract risk rather than a real human outcome, you don’t have safeguarding, you have compliance cosplay.</blockquote><p>And if the most senior person is the risk, you need a pre-agreed speak‑up route (not just “be brave”). A stop rule. A named escalation contact outside the immediate hierarchy, and a culture where safeguards are rehearsed, not improvised. In academia, the ethics board that approved the study is one route of escalation.</p><figure><img alt=""Measuring tape wrapped around an apple symbolising diet and eating disorders.

Source: Pexels.</figcaption></figure><h4>Field note #4: the day the institution-to-institution relationship collapsed</h4><p>Here’s a scenario I wish more safeguarding plans covered: governance collapse.</p><p>I once travelled across the country for fieldwork in a healthcare setting. Everything looked “approved” on paper. Then I arrived, and suddenly I had no access. Nobody would speak to me and I was told to wait in reception for hours. Doors that should have opened didn’t. The relationship between the university and the partner organisation had fractured at a senior level, and I’d been left out of the loop.</p><p>So there I was with wasted travel cost, time, energy, preparation and a hard stop. This is safeguarding too.</p><blockquote>Because safeguarding is also about protecting the <strong>work</strong> and the <strong>researcher</strong>. If a breakdown in institutional comms can strand you physically, professionally, and emotionally (and sometimes financially), then it needs to sit in the risk register like any other operational risk.</blockquote><p>The question we rarely ask is who covers what? Before I now travel for fieldwork, I confirm insurance/indemnity and cancellation rules:</p><ul><li>who covers travel costs if access collapses,</li><li>whether professional indemnity/public liability applies (especially if contracting), and</li><li>who has authority to pause/stop fieldwork if safety conditions change.</li></ul><h4>Field note #5: families as a risk variable</h4><p>In social care settings, there’s another layer that rarely makes it into tidy templates:</p><blockquote>Families can be protective and brilliant, and they can also be chaotic, accusatory, and sometimes actively harmful.</blockquote><p>During my time working in social care and in an NHS rehab service, I’ve seen families raise serious concerns that were absolutely legitimate and needed action.</p><p>I’ve also seen families create issues where there were none. And I’ve seen situations where family members were taking money from someone in care, then implying it was the setting’s fault or that the staff “didn’t do their job properly” and attempting to escalate formally.</p><p>As researchers, we don’t prosecute. But we do need to plan for:</p><ul><li>third‑party risk,</li><li>allegations and counter‑allegations,</li><li>reputational volatility,</li><li>and the possibility that “what’s true” is not always clear in the moment.</li></ul><h4>Field note #6: when the VPN and firewall are so safe they break the research</h4><p>In one organisation, we assumed the laptops provided would seamlessly connect to Wi‑Fi on sites being visited. Trust me when I say: they did not. The firewall and VPN were so secure that even the host IT team couldn’t troubleshoot the connection.</p><p>The result was that MS Teams wouldn’t run, recording didn’t work, and there was no built‑in audio recording on the laptop. I also didn’t have a dedicated work mobile, so using my personal phone to capture audio would have breached policy.</p><p>We defaulted to note-taking, but even that became an issue because uploads to the analysis tool kept failing. We ended up with an incomplete dataset and analysis that relied far too much on memory.</p><p>Safeguarding lesson here is that you need a pre‑agreed offline plan (confirming Wi‑Fi access arrangements and device/VPN constraints in advance of the visit, approved recording routes, secure note templates, and a contingency for when tech fails), especially in high-stakes/high-security settings.</p><p>Another important thing to note is that in high-security settings like prisons, secure mental health hospitals, and immigration environments, safeguarding escalates because power imbalance is built into the setting. Recording may be prohibited altogether, device access may be restricted or denied, staff may be present in the session impacting what is said and shared, and “voluntary participation” can be complicated. For such settings, your safeguards need to be even more robust and explicit like having a paired working and no lone-working at all.</p><h4>Field note #7: not everyone is willing to participate</h4><p>One of the biggest lessons I learned is that not everyone will participate, even when your intentions are good and your paperwork is flawless. In some communities, trust is not easy to earn.</p><p>I’ve turned up at settings where I simply couldn’t access the voices I came to hear. Some communities have rational reasons for being cautious: history, extraction, misrepresentation, and previous “research” that didn’t translate into change.</p><p>This taught me that refusal is data too, not a failure. Safeguarding here means:</p><blockquote>Designing for cultural safety and voluntariness which may look like working through trusted community connectors, using culturally appropriate facilitators where needed, offering different modes of participation, and being explicit that saying “no” to participation has no consequences.</blockquote><figure><img alt=""Human holding a banner saying ‘No’ against a yellow background.

They’re pragmatic. They improve safety, choice, and trust, which tends to improve the quality of what people are able (and willing) to share.</p><p>In research terms, a trauma‑informed lens pushes you to design sessions where participants:</p><ul><li>know what’s coming,</li><li>have meaningful control,</li><li>can opt out without penalty,</li><li>and aren’t pushed into disclosure “for the sake of insight”.</li></ul><p>It also forces a professional acknowledgement that researchers can be impacted too by vicarious trauma, fatigue, stress, and the physical reality of operating in high‑pressure systems.</p><h4>2) Factoring in incentives (as a safeguarding decision, not just admin)</h4><p><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9631331/"">Incentives can reduce barriers to participation</a>, but they can also create pressure, bias, or risk.</p><p>I treat incentives as part of safeguarding:</p><ul><li>It must never be framed as “payment for disclosure”.</li><li>It should not be conditional on answering every question or completing the session fully (especially in the digital world where 45 minutes into a 60 minute session, the connection breaks, or a participant faces issues when re-joining the session).</li><li>It must be safe and discreet to deliver (cash can create risk; digital delivery can create privacy issues where emails, bank account details are shared).</li><li>It <a href=""https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/research-and-innovation/research/Assets/Documents/PDF/ethics-incentives-reimbursement-etc-v5.pdf"">should be equitable</a>: if we pay for time, we should consider expenses and participation costs (travel, childcare, food etc.).</li></ul><p>And yes, incentives can attract misrepresentation. People may tell you what they think gets them “into the study”, or what they think will please you. That’s not a reason to remove incentives; it’s a reason to:</p><ul><li>design screening carefully and thoughtfully,</li><li>avoid recruitment through coercive gatekeepers,</li><li>and be clear that incentives are not linked to “performing” as a good participant.</li></ul><h4>3) Consent and assent (done properly, not performatively)</h4><p>This is the part that matters most, especially when vulnerable people are involved.</p><p><a href=""https://www.hra.nhs.uk/planning-and-improving-research/best-practice/informing-participants-and-seeking-consent""><strong>Consent</strong></a><strong> for adults with capacity</strong> must be informed, freely given, specific, and ongoing (reconfirm at key moments).</p><p><strong>Children: </strong><a href=""https://www.hra-decisiontools.org.uk/consent/principles-children.html#:~:text=Consent%20is%20a%20legally%20defined,their%20capacity%20when%20seeking%20assent.""><strong>consent + assent</strong></a></p><ul><li>Parental/guardian consent may be required (depending on policy and age).</li><li>Child assent should still be sought even when an adult has consented on their behalf.</li></ul><p>Assent is not a tick-box. It’s the child’s affirmative agreement, expressed in age-appropriate ways. And here’s what it may look like:</p><ul><li>If the child does not want to take part, verbally or non‑verbally, we stop.</li><li>If the child wants to stop partway through, we stop.</li><li>If the child wants to skip a question, we skip it.</li></ul><p>No negotiation. No persuasion. No “just one more question.”</p><p><strong>Vulnerable adults/adults who may lack capacity: </strong><a href=""https://www.cqc.org.uk/guidance-regulation/providers/regulations-service-providers-and-managers/health-social-care-act/regulation-11""><strong>supported decision‑making + assent</strong></a></p><ul><li>Use supported decision-making (plain language, time, breaks, visuals, accessible formats).</li><li>Check understanding by asking them to explain back (in their own words) what will happen, what will be recorded, and that they can stop.</li></ul><p>If a person cannot understand/retain/weigh the information or communicate a decision even with support:</p><ul><li>you cannot rely on their consent alone,</li><li>you may need a legally authorised representative process (depending on jurisdiction/policy),</li><li>and you should still seek the person’s assent and monitor for distress or dissent.</li></ul><p>And again: if they show they don’t want to continue, we stop.</p><p><strong>Gatekeepers (who protect voluntariness)</strong><br />Teachers, carers, clinicians, managers, and yes, prison staff, can enable access and unintentionally pressure participation. Build in:</p><ul><li>a private opt‑out route,</li><li>clear “no consequence” language,</li><li>and a cooling-off window where appropriate.</li></ul><h3>5 things I now do before I enter any setting (and why)</h3><p>These are the “unsexy” steps that make fieldwork safer, and prevent heroics from becoming the plan:</p><h4>1) Map safeguarding on both sides (and confirm clearance)</h4><ul><li>Identify the host setting’s safeguarding lead and read their safeguarding policy before you arrive.</li><li>Identify your organisation’s safeguarding lead and escalation route.</li><li>Make sure both ends know how to reach each other quickly.</li><li>Confirm clearance requirements early (e.g., enhanced DBS, prison/security vetting, NHS site rules). If clearance won’t land in time: pivot method early.</li></ul><h4>2) Build a fieldwork tracker (treat it like an asset, not admin)</h4><p>Document:</p><ul><li>where you’re going (exact building location),</li><li>photos of the entrance if it’s a complex site,</li><li>who you’re meeting (names where appropriate, roles, agreed contact details),</li><li>a named contact with a mobile number,</li><li>timings, check‑in/out times, contingency routes,</li><li>language requirements (do participants communicate in English; do you need an interpreter).</li><li>Inform the setting that you’ll need to access their network and ask for WiFi and device connectivity early on so you avoid delays on the day.</li><li>Create a separate tracker for your participants where you use participant IDs but keep participant contact details separate.</li><li>Have a tracker for research work where you keep a record of what was recorded, with whom, who conducted the session, who took notes, who observed, what supplementary material was provided, if you upload the material and notes etc. For online research, you can adapt this tracker (links, time zones, backup numbers, “what if the platform fails”).</li><li>For data security, upload to secure storage promptly, and don’t rely on “I’ll sort it later” when you’re travelling.</li></ul><h4>3) Treat public health as part of safeguarding (post‑COVID reality)</h4><p>Before in‑person work:</p><ul><li>ask the site about outbreaks or visitor restrictions,</li><li>confirm PPE expectations (even if “optional”),</li><li>decide in advance what triggers a reschedule or a switch to remote.</li></ul><h4>4) Plan reset capacity like it’s a delivery constraint (because it is)</h4><ul><li>Cap the number of intensive visits per week.</li><li>Build half-day resets into schedules where needed.</li><li>Protect debrief time as non‑negotiable (not a “nice to have”).</li></ul><p>People who haven’t done fieldwork often only see the interview hour. They don’t see the off-stage work: ethics, documentation, travel (and all the drama of delays and connectivity), relationship management, safeguarding alignment, the emotional labour of holding space, and the operational coordination required to get usable data without harming anyone.</p><p>So if your team asks for frequent check-ins or expects you to do additional work, ensure that you set their expectations by walking them through all the off stage work needed.</p><h4>5) Run a dynamic risk assessment on the day (including semi‑public spaces)</h4><p>Conditions change fast: staffing, space, local incidents, illness levels, travel disruption. Your plan needs a mechanism for responding without stress.</p><p>And if you’re observing in semi‑public spaces (corridors, waiting rooms, receptions): plan for bystanders who didn’t consent. Decide what you record, how you protect privacy, and when you pause or reposition.</p><h3>My template (use it and adapt it)</h3><p>I’m sharing the template I now use as a default for discovery projects, user research and service design work across education, health, social care, pharmaceutical, justice, and other high‑stakes environments.</p><p>It’s intentionally written as a template: you’ll need to tailor it to your organisation’s safeguarding policy, ethics process, and the host setting’s local requirements.</p><p>If you’re working with children or vulnerable adults, you should always align the plan with the host organisation’s safeguarding lead and your own organisational safeguarding lead before fieldwork starts.</p><h3>Safeguarding plan template for research (and design)</h3><h3>1.

<h4>We have decades of data proving design’s business value. So why do we still lose every budget fight?</h4><figure><img alt=""Abstract geometric illustration in Mondrian style with overlapping rectangles in red, blue, yellow and black, representing design frameworks and business structure"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_wRdyx0G_yje4RDYTxkNFw.png"" /><figcaption>Generated using Midjourney</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve watched it happen too many times. You spend weeks researching, prototyping, testing. The users love it. The data backs it. Then someone in the room says “I don’t like blue” or “my wife thinks this is confusing” and suddenly everything’s back on the table. Design decisions get discarded like they’re optional decorations, not strategic choices backed by evidence.</p><p>In most companies I’ve worked with, design is an afterthought. Something you add after the important decisions get made. Which means when budget cuts come, when timelines compress, when stakeholders disagree — design goes first. And the worst part? We stand there unable to articulate why that’s a mistake in terms anyone will listen to.</p><p>Here’s what makes this infuriating: <strong>the evidence that design creates business value is unambiguous</strong>. McKinsey studied 300 publicly listed companies over five years and found that top-quartile design performers achieved <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-business-value-of-design"">32% points higher revenue growth and 56% points higher total returns to shareholders</a>. The Design Management Institute tracked design-led companies for a decade and found they <a href=""https://fortune.com/2017/08/31/the-design-value-index-shows-what-design-thinking-is-worth/"">outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 211%</a>.</p><p>Yet design teams get cut disproportionately during layoffs. We lose budget allocation fights. We remain stuck in service organization roles while marketing and product management sit at the strategic table making decisions about what we’ll build.</p><p>The problem isn’t that design lacks value. The problem is that we — as a profession — never learned how to prove it in language that organizations understand.</p><p>And this isn’t about individual designers being bad at business. This is systemic. This is about how design professionalized, how design education evolved, and how the industry systematically failed to build business articulation capability into our DNA from the start.</p><p>John Maeda’s annual <a href=""https://designintech.report/"">Design in Tech reports</a> have tracked design’s rise in Silicon Valley for over a decade, documenting the evolution from “classical design” to “computational design.” His 2024 report carried an urgent warning: “Work Transformation Is Coming FAST” for design careers. Yet even as design’s technical capabilities expanded, its business legitimacy remained precarious.</p><h3>We inherited a philosophy that actively opposed commercial thinking</h3><p>The roots go deeper than you’d think. When Walter Gropius established the Bauhaus in 1919, he deliberately positioned design as an artistic and technical pursuit <em>opposed to</em> commercial concerns. The curriculum emphasized “form follows function” and workshop-based learning, but <a href=""https://novedge.com/blogs/design-news/design-software-history-the-influence-of-the-bauhaus-movement-on-the-evolution-of-design-software-and-its-lasting-legacy-in-modern-design-practices"">explicitly excluded business, history, and commercial context</a>.</p><p>This wasn’t neutral. It established a professional identity centered on craft excellence and creative autonomy — values that positioned designers as separate from commercial enterprise. When László Moholy-Nagy founded the New Bauhaus in Chicago in 1937 and Josef Albers joined Black Mountain College, they carried this DNA into American design education. The pattern replicated through Ulm, RISD, and eventually into the academic design programs that produce most professional designers today.</p><p>Mike Monteiro frames this inheritance bluntly in <a href=""https://www.designisajob.com""><em>Design Is a Job</em></a>: designers must understand they’re “running a business, not a hobby.” Yet this framing contradicts the very foundation of modern design education, which positioned commercial concerns as antithetical to craft excellence. While marketing departments in the 1950s-70s were learning to speak the language of ROI and revenue attribution, design schools were teaching students that commercial thinking corrupted creative integrity.</p><p>Nigel Cross’s influential 1982 paper <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Cross"">“Designerly Ways of Knowing”</a> cemented this separation by establishing design as a “third culture” distinct from both sciences and humanities. While this legitimized design academically, it also reinforced our distance from business disciplines. Cross positioned design cognition as fundamentally different from analytical thinking — valuable insight that inadvertently made cross-functional translation harder.</p><p><strong>Compare this to other professions</strong>. The <a href=""https://www.carnegiefoundation.org/about/who_we_are/our-legacy/"">Flexner Report of 1910</a> transformed medical education by standardizing training and establishing clear professional standards. The <a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1908453"">Carnegie Foundation’s subsequent studies</a> of law, medicine, and engineering identified a pattern: successful professional education combines technical skill with professional identity formation that includes service, responsibility, and yes — business reality.</p><p>Design education never underwent equivalent transformation. There was no Flexner Report for design. No moment of standardization that required business competency as part of becoming a professional designer.</p><p>So we learned to make beautiful things, thoughtful things, user-centered things. But nobody taught us how to defend them when someone asks “What’s the ROI?”</p><p>Design education’s failure to incorporate business competency isn’t new criticism. <a href=""https://jnd.org/why-design-education-must-change/"">Don Norman</a> — former Apple VP and author of The Design of Everyday Things — has spent decades advocating for educational reform. In his influential 2010 essay “Why Design Education Must Change,” Norman observed that designers often lack “requisite understanding” of behavioral sciences, technology, and business: “Design schools do not train students about these complex issues, about the interlocking complexities of human and social behavior.” His 2019 <a href=""https://www.futureofdesigneducation.org/about"">Future of Design Education</a> initiative with IBM’s Karel Vredenburg brought together 600+ volunteers to address the gap between <a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/90669651/inside-don-normans-herculean-quest-to-fix-design-education"">design education</a> and professional demands. Yet as Norman noted, “the vast majority of schools [remain] incredibly resistant, unable to change.”</p><figure><img alt=""Timeline comparing professionalization paths: Marketing (1950s-2010s), Product Management (1931–1998), Design (ongoing gap in business education)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9VCLeyxHTdJjROHLjdWUBw.png"" /><figcaption>Source: Author</figcaption></figure><h3>Meanwhile, marketing and product management learned the language of power</h3><p>Understanding why design gets marginalized requires looking at how other functions earned their strategic seats. The histories of marketing and product management reveal paths we haven’t followed.</p><p>Marketing’s strategic ascent took decades. In the 1950s, marketing existed primarily as advertising coordination. By the 1970s, marketers at companies like Procter &amp; Gamble had assumed profit-and-loss responsibility — a critical legitimizing move that forced financial accountability. The CMO title appeared in the 1990s, and by the 2010s, <a href=""https://hbr.org/2017/07/the-evolution-of-the-cmo"">marketing led digital activities in 92% of companies</a>.</p><p>The key transition? Marketers learned to speak in revenue attribution, customer acquisition cost, lifetime value — the language finance already understood.</p><p>Product management’s rise is even more instructive. The role started with Neil McElroy’s 1931 “Brand Man” memo at Procter &amp; Gamble, defining someone responsible for tracking sales and driving business outcomes. When Bill Hewlett and David Packard adapted this at HP in the 1940s, they created the modern product manager as “voice of the customer internally.”</p><p>But the decisive framing came from <a href=""https://hbr.org/2017/07/the-evolution-of-the-cmo"">Ben Horowitz’s 1998 memo “Good Product Manager/Bad Product Manager,”</a> which positioned PMs as “CEO of the product” — explicitly claiming strategic accountability rather than coordination responsibility.</p><p>Sociologist Andrew Abbott’s “The System of Professions” (1988) provides the framework for understanding these trajectories. Abbott argues that professions compete over “jurisdictions” — claims of ownership over expert knowledge. A profession gains legitimacy through diagnosis (classifying problems), inference (applying knowledge), and treatment (implementing solutions).</p><p>Marketing claimed the customer relationship jurisdiction. Product management claimed product success jurisdiction.</p><p>What jurisdiction has design claimed that executives recognize as strategically essential?</p><p><a href=""https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amr.1995.9508080331"">Mark Suchman’s legitimacy research</a> (Academy of Management Review, 1995) identifies three forms: pragmatic (“What can you do for me?”), moral (normative approval), and cognitive (taken-for-grantedness). Cognitive legitimacy is most powerful but rarest.</p><p>Marketing and product management have achieved cognitive legitimacy in most organizations — their presence at strategic discussions is assumed. Design remains trapped at pragmatic level, constantly having to prove immediate utility.</p><figure><img alt=""Comparison table showing Marketing, Product Management, Engineering, and Design across jurisdiction claims, metrics used, and legitimacy status"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YZA01jEzLvsDqEuM6shK5w.png"" /><figcaption>Source: Author</figcaption></figure><h3>The metrics we use don’t connect to decisions executives make</h3><p>Here’s where the disconnect gets concrete. Designers measure experience quality: task completion rates, System Usability Scale scores, Net Promoter Score, user satisfaction surveys.</p><p>These metrics measure something real. But as <a href=""https://businessofsoftware.org/talks/design-metrics-matter-jared-spool/"">Jared Spool observed</a>: “The metrics out of the box didn’t help us one little bit. They just created confusion.”</p><p>The problem isn’t that NPS or SUS are invalid. It’s that they exist in a different causal chain than executive decision-making.

In other words: design and research teams were disproportionately targeted.</p><p>The UX Collective’s 2024 State of UX report, authored by <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-state-of-ux-in-2024-enter-late-stage-ux-e9b403b67667"">Fabricio Teixeira</a> and <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/why-designers-quit-2023-report-24dae87d7896"">Caio Braga</a>, identified what they call “late-stage UX” — comparing the current industry state to late-stage capitalism. Their analysis of over 1,000 articles from 2023 found design characterized by “market saturation, heavy focus on financial growth, commoditization, automation, and increased financialization.” Designers can now only push so far when advocating for user needs against corporate influence. Matej Latin’s 2023 survey of 293 designers found that 14.3% were laid off — a staggering increase from 2022, when layoffs weren’t significant enough to track.</p><p>Indeed’s job posting data showed UX Research positions decreased <strong>89%</strong> from their 2022 peak to January 2024.</p><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/why-is-the-ux-job-market-such-a-mess-right-now-a-comprehensive-explanation-97d5588696fd"">Jared Spool</a>, in his January 2024 analysis “Why is the UX job market such a mess right now?”, pushed back on the myth that UX was disproportionately targeted: “There’s no evidence to support this. When Meta laid off 21,000 people in 2022 and 2023, a few hundred were UX people… UX people were never more than a small proportion of the total people let go.” Yet this statistical nuance provides cold comfort — whether designers were targeted specifically or caught in broader cuts, the result remains: design teams shrinking, roles disappearing, and a profession unable to articulate why this is strategically catastrophic.</p><p>Google Cloud’s October 2025 layoffs cut 100+ design-related positions, with some design teams reduced by half. The pattern repeats: when cost-cutting pressures intensify, design becomes expendable because its contribution remains unquantified.</p><p>I’ve seen this up close. Talented designers with years of institutional knowledge, cut because nobody could articulate their business value in the thirty seconds it took finance to scan the headcount spreadsheet.</p><p><strong>Intuit’s 2007 Design for Delight launch</strong> illustrates how articulation failures play out even with executive support. Founder Scott Cook invited Intuit’s top 300 managers to an off-site to introduce design thinking. He delivered a five-hour PowerPoint presentation. The result: “Polite, yet unengaged response.”</p><p>Then Stanford’s Alex Kazaks presented for one hour using hands-on exercises.

Design’s strategic position at Apple depended on Jobs’s protection and Ive’s access; remove those, and organizational gravity pulled design back toward service function.</p><h3>We’re speaking different languages and don’t even realize it</h3><p>The communication divide operates at multiple levels. <a href=""https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1671890/FULLTEXT01.pdf"">Carlile’s 2002 research on knowledge boundaries</a> identifies “syntactic boundaries” from differences in vocabulary and protocols between professional groups.

He <a href=""https://designobserver.com/making-change-the-product-phil-gilbert-on-transforming-ibm-from-the-inside-out/"">created internal “brand”</a> by avoiding preconceived terms: “I could either change 400,000 minds, or create a concept that meant nothing at IBM and define it ourselves.”</p><p>He made design services something teams paid for, creating demand rather than mandating adoption. He secured CEO sponsorship (Ginni Rometty).

Kerry Rodden, Hilary Hutchinson, and Xin Fu developed HEART in their 2010 CHI conference paper “<a href=""https://research.google/pubs/measuring-the-user-experience-on-a-large-scale-user-centered-metrics-for-web-applications/"">Measuring the User Experience on a Large Scale: User-Centered Metrics for Web Applications</a>,” specifically to fill the gap between small-scale qualitative observations and large-scale automated measurement.</p><p>Google uses it internally across products. The Gmail “undo send” feature emerged from <a href=""https://www.lyssna.com/blog/google-heart-framework/"">happiness metrics tracking</a>.</p><p>Jared Spool’s outcome-driven metrics, detailed in his famous “<a href=""https://articles.centercentre.com/three_hund_million_button/"">$300 Million Button</a>” case study, focus on “problem-value metrics” — quantifying UX obstacles in dollar terms. An e-commerce company identified checkout failures through usability testing, created a custom metric (“unrealized shopping cart value from password issues”), implemented guest checkout, and recovered $300 million annually.</p><p>The metric framing transformed “registration causes friction” into financial language executives understood. Spool’s principle: “Surface the cost of not removing obstacles — this gives executives a perspective about UX they’ve never had before.”</p><p><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/calculating-roi-design-projects/""><strong>Nielsen Norman Group’s ROI framework</strong></a> attempts direct financial calculation, though they appropriately note that “ROI calculations are strategic exercises to help you conceptualize the relative value of design projects. They are not financial projections.”</p><p>The methodology: identify specific business metrics affected (revenue, cost savings, productivity), establish baseline and target values, calculate investment cost, project time to achieve targets, and compute ROI.</p><p><strong>Les Binet and Peter Field’s advertising effectiveness research</strong> offers lessons from a discipline that solved its measurement problem. Analyzing nearly 1,000 advertising case studies spanning 30+ years, they established frameworks that created evidential infrastructure design currently lacks.</p><p>Advertising’s effectiveness awards, shared databanks for meta-analysis, and common measurement frameworks built the credibility that design needs.</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of Google’s Heart Framework."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*n3gKKb3K2fenolM-jZjUqA.png"" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=""https://www.appcues.com/blog/google-improves-user-experience-with-heart-framework"">https://www.appcues.com/blog/google-improves-user-experience-with-heart-framework</a></figcaption></figure><h3>What needs to change (and who needs to change it)</h3><p>The research points toward structural interventions, not individual heroism. This problem is systemic. Solutions must be too.</p><p><strong>Design education must incorporate business competency as core requirement.</strong> The <a href=""https://carey.jhu.edu/explore-carey-mba/design-leadership"">Johns Hopkins/MICA Design Leadership MA/MBA</a> and <a href=""https://id.iit.edu/graduate-school/master-of-design-mba/"">IIT Institute of Design MDes/MBA</a> programs exist because the market recognizes this gap. But such programs remain exceptions.</p><p>Mainstreaming business literacy into undergraduate and bootcamp design education would address the problem at source.</p><p><strong>Professional organizations must build measurement infrastructure.</strong> Shared databases of design effectiveness case studies, common metrics frameworks, longitudinal research programs would provide the evidential base we currently lack. The <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-business-value-of-design"">McKinsey Design Index</a> and <a href=""https://fortune.com/2017/08/31/the-design-value-index-shows-what-design-thinking-is-worth/"">DMI Design Value Index</a> demonstrate the concept’s power.</p><p><strong>Designers must learn to speak both languages</strong> without abandoning native expertise. This isn’t about becoming business people who do some design. It’s about developing boundary-spanning capability that research identifies as critical for cross-functional influence.</p><p><strong>Organizations investing in design must create structural legitimacy.</strong> IBM’s transformation worked because Gilbert built organizational infrastructure — not just because IBM hired designers. Design Program Offices, certification programs, embedded teams, executive sponsorship.</p><p>And for those of us in the trenches right now?</p><p>Start translating. Every design recommendation you make, every research finding you present — ask yourself: “How would I frame this in terms of revenue, cost reduction, or risk mitigation?”</p><p>It feels reductive at first. It feels like we’re reducing craft to spreadsheets.</p><p>But here’s the thing: the alternative is watching your best work get discarded because someone in the room didn’t like the color blue.</p><h3>The paradox we need to resolve</h3><p>Jodi Rae, when creating the Design Value Index, captured design’s fundamental challenge: “People who are convinced of the value of design are not interested in quantifying it. The CEOs in all of the DVI companies already understand the power of design… Those most interested in quantifying the value of design are the financial people, which shows they don’t really understand the power of design.”</p><p>This paradox isn’t inevitable. It’s the predictable outcome of a profession that built exceptional craft capability while neglecting business articulation capability.</p><p>The good news? This problem is structural, not inherent.</p><p>Marketing learned to prove ROI. Product management learned to claim strategic accountability. HR learned to speak in financial terms. Data science learned to demonstrate decision impact.</p><p>Each discipline underwent professionalization transitions that design has yet to complete.</p><p>The research suggests this transition is achievable — but requires coordinated action: education reform, professional infrastructure, organizational change, individual development.</p><p>We’re not the cause of this problem. But we’re positioned to catalyze its solution.</p><p>Design’s business value is empirically demonstrated. The task now is building the professional infrastructure to articulate it — to translate craft excellence into language that organizational decision-making recognizes and rewards.</p><p>Because the alternative is watching another generation of talented designers get laid off while someone in finance looks at a spreadsheet and decides design is optional.</p><p>It’s not. And it’s time we learned how to prove it.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=79f2e7d59c8b"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/when-your-best-work-gets-tossed-79f2e7d59c8b"">When your best work gets tossed</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>How researchers can define quality, guide prompts, and shape the value of AI outputs.</h4><p>AI agents, synthetic users, deep research, staying relevant as a UX researcher can feel like a challenge that resets every week. Teams across product, design, and engineering are moving faster than ever, often powered by the same underlying AI technologies. <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/human-machine-responsible-ai-workflows-for-ux-research-22a5c39ac0ec"">Prompt engineering and system design have quickly become central topics across disciplines</a>, raising a familiar, and uncomfortable, question: <em>where does UX research fit now?</em></p><p>My experience building LLM-based products over the past two years has led me to a clear conclusion. This moment is not the end of UX research. It is the same work we have always done, understanding people, defining value, but applied to a new class of systems. And for researchers willing to adapt, it creates an opportunity to move upstream and become more strategic than ever. As products become cheaper to build and AI spreads across nearly every workflow, teams now face a new foundational decision: how much AI should this feature contain?</p><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/is-your-ai-use-case-idea-really-going-to-work-7718c695e7c0"">When the answer is “yes”, and it is not always</a>, the work does not stop there. A second, equally important question follows: <em>what form should that AI take?</em> One of the most prescient frameworks in this space comes from <a href=""https://www.emcap.com/thoughts/your-success-with-generative-ai-may-come-down-to-these-ux-decisions"">Jake Saper and Jessica Cohen at Emergence Capital, who describe AI products along a spectrum</a>. On one end are pure chat-based systems that maximize flexibility. On the other are AI-enhanced features that trade flexibility for simplicity. Most production features live closer to the latter. The product defines the prompt, sometimes with light user input, and delivers the output in a predetermined format. Every “summarize,” “rewrite,” or “generate” button we encounter today reflects this tradeoff.</p><p>Delivering value with AI enhanced features means having a solid understanding of what the user is attempting to achieve within the context of their workflow both for the actual output and the design of how it is delivered. Take for example, a summarize feature. A summary can mean many different things depending on where it is being delivered. A “Summarize” button offered in Gmail likely needs punchy and bulleted contents. The same within Adobe acrobat for a large PDF could mean a multi paragraph executive summary. It is all about context and the actual need in the moment. The same we have always been doing but new.</p><figure><img alt=""Adobe buttons for taking AI Actions"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/774/1*lYL-7x1LLVuJ-LBP0ey62w.png"" /><figcaption>Adobe buttons for taking AI Actions</figcaption></figure><p>NotebookLM offers a compelling example of this shift. The product began as a chat-based, retrieval-augmented system. It gained widespread attention with its audio overview feature, which generated a podcast-style summary of a user’s materials, no prompting required. That feature delivered immediate, differentiated value by meeting a specific user need in a novel format. While the initial novelty has faded, subsequent updates have reinforced NotebookLM’s position as a model for AI-enhanced productivity.</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of the NotebookLM feature including sources, the overview page, and the studio feature."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5e0Ox6q7MpceIhZjBBiXBw.png"" /><figcaption>A screenshot of the NotebookLM feature including sources, the overview page, and the studio features</figcaption></figure><p>The Studio feature set within NotebookLM illustrates the pattern particularly well. Users are presented with a set of structured options that guide them toward generating reports, briefs, or analyses. The real power lies not in unrestricted chat, but in the ability to lightly customize a pre-generated prompt. In Emergence Capital’s terms, this is a true copilot: a system that helps users provide the right input in order to receive a valuable output. When a user asks NotebookLM to generate a report, success is not defined by grammatical correctness or factual accuracy alone. Success is whether the output fits the user’s actual need, whether it advances their task, supports their workflow, or deepens their understanding.</p><p>This is where the role of UX research begins to change… not in kind, but in scope.</p><h3>A New Way to Create Value</h3><p>Creating value with LLM-based features is not about writing the cleverest prompt. It is about defining the right instructions so the system produces something that is genuinely useful to the user in that moment. Prompt quality matters, but prompts do not exist in a vacuum. They sit at the intersection of engineering, design, and, critically, research.</p><p>NotebookLM’s opening chat response is a useful example. As a user logs in, the chat window is filled with an overview of all contents that helps users make sense of their materials as soon as they open a notebook, reducing the cognitive cost of re-orienting themselves. Engineering work was required to craft prompts that reliably surface the right insights. Design work was required to decide how that information should appear on the page. But neither of those efforts can succeed without first understanding what users actually need at the moment of entry. That understanding is where research does its most important work, informing both what the system should generate and how that output should be presented.</p><figure><img alt=""NotebookLM opens with a summary of the Notebooks"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Hk912CHJxIPta3jysWeUEg.png"" /><figcaption>NotebookLM opens with a summary of the Notebooks</figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/ai-ux-design-for-intelligent-interfaces-bc966e96107d"">Design guidance for displaying AI-generated content is relatively well covered.</a> <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/search?q=ai+in+product"">Many strong frameworks already exist for structuring text, surfacing key information, and presenting outputs in ways that are readable and actionable.</a> What has received far less attention is the upstream work of shaping the instructions that guide generation in the first place. Ensuring a prompt is directionally correct — aligned to real user needs rather than abstract capabilities, was always important. With LLMs, it becomes foundational.</p><p>This is where UX research creates new leverage. By engaging early, researchers can help teams anchor feature development in what is actually possible given both the state of the technology and the user’s needs in context. In my experience, this approach consistently opens up more promising product directions. Instead of retrofitting research onto an already-defined solution, teams start with a shared understanding of value, giving design and engineering a clearer target to aim for as they build.</p><h3>A New Process for Defining Quality in Outputs</h3><p>For decades, UX research has focused on identifying the user needs a product must satisfy. That part of the work is unchanged. What <em>is</em> new is the nature of the systems we are designing. With large language models, teams no longer have complete control over outputs. These systems are inherently non-deterministic, we can guide them, but we cannot fully dictate what they will produce.</p><p>In traditional product design, many needs could be satisfied with deterministic solutions. When Apple realized people were using their iPhones as flashlights, the solution was straightforward: a single button that produced a single, predictable outcome. One tap, immediate value. No ambiguity, no interpretation required. That model works well when the need is simple and the desired outcome is clear.</p><figure><img alt=""iPhone flashlight buttons that is placed on the Lock Screen for ease of use"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*WDyogOfVTb78FQwo"" /><figcaption>iPhone flashlight buttons that is placed on the Lock Screen for ease of use</figcaption></figure><p>As needs become more complex, so does the solution. Uber faced a different problem: passengers felt anxious while waiting for their ride. The company could not control the behavior of individual drivers, so instead it designed an experience to manage uncertainty. <a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/uber-algorithm-fake/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">A live map showed the driver’s progress (although not always truthfully)</a>. Messaging explained potential delays. Contact options gave users a sense of agency. Each element addressed the same underlying issue, negative sentiment during the wait, even though the core system remained unpredictable.</p><figure><img alt=""A screen grab of a car moving toward a destination on Uber App"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*SrfQbAaDBqm8Gh6H"" /><figcaption>A screen grab of a car moving toward a destination on Uber App</figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://medium.com/ai-ux-designers/ai-is-breaking-free-an-emerging-ai-ux-pattern-26894a915d93"">Working with LLMs is similar, but amplified</a>. An LLM behaves less like a traditional interface and more like a human collaborator: responsive, capable, and inconsistent. It may produce insightful results one moment and confident-sounding nonsense the next. This unpredictability is not a flaw; it is a property of the technology. The challenge, then, is not eliminating variability, but maximizing output quality despite it.</p><p>That challenge requires a different approach. Rather than treating quality as an after-the-fact judgment, teams must define what “good” looks like in advance, and do so in a way that acknowledges uncertainty. This is where UX research plays a central role: translating user needs into clear quality signals that can guide generation, evaluation, and ongoing refinement, even when outputs cannot be fully controlled. Here is how I got about it.</p><h4>Surfacing Quality Signals</h4><p>The first step is establishing a shared understanding of what constitutes a high-quality experience. When a user requests a briefing document in NotebookLM, what are they actually expecting to see? The answer is inherently subjective. Different users bring different expectations, shaped by their goals, context, and prior experience.</p><p>This is why qualitative research is essential. In-depth interviews allow teams to understand not just <em>what</em> users say they want, but <em>how</em> they judge AI-generated outputs in practice. I start by asking users to share what they expect to see as an output. Afterwards, I walk them through examples, either outputs they already use or ones I introduce, and have them describe what they mean when they say something “informs,” “summarizes,” or “provides direction.” These conversations reveal the mental models users bring to AI systems and the tradeoffs they are willing to make.</p><p>As classic Jobs to Be Done research has shown, people are rarely asking for features in the abstract, they are trying to make progress in a specific situation. The same principle applies here. With that mindset, research becomes a game of identifying the main themes in what users are asking for in the output.</p><p>In the case of NotebookLM, early qualitative work might surface themes such as trust, cognitive relief, contextual relevance, and actionability. Users may not articulate all of these dimensions explicitly, but patterns emerge across interviews. A useful heuristic here is the 80/20 rule: a relatively small set of research-derived criteria can account for the majority of users’ expectations.</p><p>For example, a high-quality briefing report in Notebook might be judged on whether it:</p><ul><li>Feels trustworthy</li><li>Demonstrates understanding across multiple sources</li><li>Reflects the user’s current context</li><li>Connects insights to realistic next actions</li></ul><h4>Validation and Refinement</h4><p>Once core quality themes are identified, the next step is validation and refinement at scale. Surveys are particularly effective here. They allow teams to translate high-level themes into more specific, testable factors and to understand how consistently those factors matter across users and contexts. When designing these studies, I ask participants to evaluate outputs that closely resemble what the product would actually generate. Users are then asked to rate and critique those outputs, providing nuance around what makes them useful, or not.</p><p>Take trust as an example. Users frequently say they want AI outputs they can trust, but trust is not a single, universal attribute. At a minimum, it implies factual correctness. Beyond that, trust is shaped by tone, length, structure, and framing, all of which vary by context. <a href=""https://medium.com/%40mariamargarida/designing-with-ai-ux-considerations-and-best-practices-5c6b69b92c4c"">An email summary should be concise and direct. An executive briefing should surface key themes and unexpected insights.</a> A call recap should highlight action items and mention relevant stakeholders. When an output matches what users expect in that situation, trust follows.</p><p>Surveys help teams refine these distinctions. In the NotebookLM case, researchers might explore when users feel a pre-created executive briefing demonstrates contextual awareness and when it does not. For example, users may respond positively when recent meetings or emails are incorporated appropriately, and negatively when outdated or irrelevant documents are surfaced. This level of specificity is critical, it directly informs how prompts should be written and constrained.</p><h4>Creating a Quality Rubric</h4><p>With qualitative depth and survey validation in place, the next step is synthesizing insights into a shared quality rubric. There is an immediate opportunity for the engineering team to create refinement, yet as previously suggested, it is not just about the actual output but how it is designed. As such, this rubric can become the centering focus for the entire team.</p><p>A well-designed rubric defines each quality factor clearly, illustrates what good and poor outputs look like, and makes tradeoffs explicit. It allows designers, product managers, and engineers to align on what success means and how it should be evaluated. Importantly, it translates research insights into something actionable.</p><p>For prompt engineers, the rubric serves as a definition of the <strong>global maximum</strong>, the set of characteristics the system should optimize for overall. Prompt iteration can then focus on finding local maxima within that boundary, confident that improvements are aligned with real user needs rather than proxy metrics.</p><figure><img alt=""Example of Metric Rubric for NotebookLM"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*r0e7MNnSxTo_jHMxDAVlug.png"" /><figcaption>EXAMPLE: NotebookLM Summary Output Quality Rubric</figcaption></figure><h4>Continued Refinement</h4><p>Even with a strong rubric and well-crafted prompts, the work does not end. Many teams now rely on AI-based testing and automated evaluation to refine LLM outputs over time. Companies such as <a href=""https://www.braintrust.dev/"">BrainTrust</a> have built extensive platforms that allow product teams to test the output of their prompts at scale, across models. Leveraging these tools are far more effective when grounded in research-defined quality criteria.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of the Braintrust app, showing evals at scale."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ci85QVqGfpeeBUbeWFYSlw.png"" /><figcaption>Braintrust has an extensive automated evaluation system</figcaption></figure><p>A solid rubric ensures that synthetic user testing, automated scoring, and iterative refinement are anchored in metrics that matter to real people. Rather than optimizing loosely connected signals, teams can focus on outcomes that genuinely improve the user experience.</p><p>This ongoing refinement is especially important in a fast-moving market. User expectations are evolving quickly as the Overton window of what is possible with AI continues to shift. A bullet-point summary that felt impressive yesterday may be table stakes today, replaced by audio, visual, or personalized formats tomorrow. Quality rubrics must be revisited and updated as expectations change, creating a sustained, strategic role for UX research in keeping AI systems aligned with human value.</p><h3>UX Research as the Interpreter of Human Value</h3><p>The science of UX research has not changed. People are still complex, contextual, and inconsistent, and understanding what they need remains the core of the work. The methods have not changed either. UX researchers are still experts at learning from users, identifying patterns, and translating insight into action.</p><p>What <em>has</em> changed is the nature of the systems we are shaping. With LLM-based products, outputs are no longer guaranteed, and a new stakeholder, the prompt engineer, has entered the room. <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/a-practitioners-journal-on-navigating-ux-in-the-age-of-ai-97f0a11e8319"">Research now has a direct line into how AI systems are instructed, evaluated, and scaled.</a> Insights no longer stop at informing interfaces or features; they define the criteria by which machine-generated work is judged as successful.</p><p>This process is not foreign to UX research, but the leverage it creates is new. By defining quality up front, researchers can shape how intelligence itself is tuned, guiding optimization, grounding automation, and ensuring that faster iteration does not come at the expense of human value. In my own work, this shift has made the field feel more relevant and more exciting than it has in years.</p><p>Done well, UX research can become the discipline that defines what people want from AI systems, and holds those systems accountable to real outcomes. AI will continue to do more of the work. That is not changing. What can change is whether that work actually matters. UX research is uniquely positioned to make sure it does.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=36285d007845"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/same-same-but-new-ux-research-in-the-age-of-llms-36285d007845"">Same, but new: UX Research in the age of LLMs</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>From chat to canvas to control panel: Understanding natural language interaction patterns</h4><figure><img alt=""Soft, misty background with a blurred human face profile on the right and the heading “Natural Language Interaction Patterns” on the left, accompanied by pill-shaped labels reading Intent, Action, and Orchestration."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GNkosiM1Eioj63cPsN-qMg.png"" /></figure><p>For much of the history of software, users had to build a mental model of the system before they could use it effectively. You learned where things lived like which menu contained which action, which screen held which information, how different parts of the interface connected to each other.</p><p>Interaction followed a structured pattern: navigate screens by clicking buttons, type into fields, scroll through content, use gestures, menus, or keyboard shortcuts to move between states. Every action required first understanding the system’s organizational logic, then locating the right control, and finally performing the correct interaction on it. Users translated what they wanted into a series of UI interactions the system understood.</p><p>While <em>affordance</em> was explicit, <em>intent</em> was indirect.</p><h3>When systems begin to understand intent</h3><p>As natural language based interaction to machine evolves, they didn’t just change how we express intent, they fundamentally compress entire workflows into single expressions.</p><p>For instance, Google search transformed how we find information precisely because it eliminated the directory-browsing model of early web portals.</p><figure><img alt=""Image comparing two navigation approaches. At the top, a hierarchical categories flow shows stacked panels moving left to right: Technology → Software → Operating System → Linux, with each selection highlighted in blue and arrows indicating deeper navigation. At the bottom, a single search bar labeled “Direct Natural Language Search” shows the query “latest news on linux OS,” illustrating direct access without navigating categories."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4CH_JqrSYUIkVUtYkLu8DQ.png"" /></figure><p>The system becomes responsible for translating that intent into the underlying sequence of actions, queries, and transformations.</p><p>This transformation fundamentally changes the contract between user and tool. Traditional interfaces required users to learn the system’s language, its navigation patterns, its terminology, its organizational logic. Natural language interfaces require the system to learn the user’s language instead.</p><h4>The Agent Shift: From understanding intent to executing work</h4><p>Modern AI interfaces extend this principle even further. Where Google compressed <em>navigation</em>, AI systems compress <em>action</em>, as Ben Shneiderman explores in his work on <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3419764"">bridging the gap between ethics and practice in human-centered AI</a>.</p><p>Plus, typing into a message box in natural language to converse with a system is straightforward, much like sending a text message. This familiarity lowers the entry barrier dramatically, making powerful AI tools immediately accessible to non-experts. And made tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Microsoft Copilot etc achieved mainstream adoption with remarkable speed.</p><h4>The conversation feed overload problem</h4><p>These conversation feed-based AI tools excel at expressing intent and getting relatively straightforward answers with better multi-turn controls. But the conversation feed can become overloaded when tasks involve multiple subsequent actions, require human intervention at various steps, or produce persistent artifacts that need to remain visible or outcomes become duplicative and longer. The linear nature of conversation thread often struggles to accommodate these complexities.</p><figure><img alt=""Animated GIF showing a user scrolling through a ChatGPT conversation feed in dark mode, revealing structured sections with headings, bullet points, and to convey longer message chains."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0vGE_GTPNE1cECtP1Y2xNw.gif"" /></figure><p>Different tools are responding to this tension:</p><ul><li>Some keep everything in the chat thread, treating code and documents as just another message</li><li>Others split the experience entirely, placing all output in a dedicated canvas</li><li>A few blend both approaches, using conversation for steering while the canvas holds the work</li></ul><p>This question of AI placement in UI design, which Sharang Sharma explored in his <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/where-should-ai-sit-in-your-ui-1710a258390e"">article</a>, becomes increasingly critical as these tools mature. The rest of this article covers observations from industry AI tools using different natural language-based interaction patterns, how they align with key aspects of interaction elements, and what we can learn if we want to build natural language-driven features, products, or systems.</p><h3>Natural language as an interaction medium</h3><p>When examining natural language interfaces through the lens of interaction design, Don Norman’s concept of the <a href=""https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262525671/the-design-of-everyday-things/"">Gulf of Execution and Gulf of Evaluation</a> provides a powerful framework for understanding how interaction loop with natural language work in these tools.</p><p><em>The Gulf of Execution</em> represents the gap between what a user intends to do and the actions required to execute it in the interface.</p><p><em>The Gulf of Evaluation </em>represents the gap between what the system does and the user’s understanding of that outcome.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram illustrating Norman’s action cycle with two loops. From “User Goal,” the top execution path flows through Identify Intention → Identify Actions → Execute in Interface → Interface. The bottom evaluation path flows from Interface Output → Interpretation → Evaluation back to User Goal, labeled as the Gulf of Execution (top) and Gulf of Evaluation (bottom)."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jK0bzL1YdrRarBHK55o7nA.png"" /></figure><p>For natural language driven interaction, instead of manually identifying and executing interface actions, users express intent directly through language. The system handles the translation from intention to action to execution. Instead of piecing together what happened from interface changes, users receive feedback in natural language, visual outputs, or a combination of both, making interpretation and evaluation more direct.</p><p>However, the effectiveness of this approach depends on how the interface distributes these interactions across different spaces.</p><p>Across existing tools that I’ve come across, I notice several patterns in how natural language bridges these gulfs. I’ve summarized three of them based on where execution happens and where evaluation takes place.</p><h4><strong>Pattern 1: Natural language interface as primary workspace</strong></h4><p>This pattern makes the <em>conversation itself the main workspace</em>, where the user expresses intent entirely in natural language and the system generates outputs in the same thread. It treats the chat as the central place for input, execution, and results along with persistent message history.</p><figure><img alt=""Four-panel comparison of AI assistant interfaces displayed in a grid, each showing long-form, structured responses in dark mode, including bullet points, headings, tables, and search-based results.

You express what you want in the chat, the system executes, and you evaluate the results all in the same thread. The entire interaction loop lives in the conversation. Your journey can end there, or you move forward into a different tool to continue the work.</p><p><strong><em>Things to be aware of</em>: </strong>Users can express broad intent easily, but they have <em>limited fine-grained control</em> over how outputs are produced, and refining results still relies on more natural language rather than precise edits. Also Piras documents <a href=""https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/02/designing-ai-beyond-conversational-interfaces/"">how conversational interfaces, while seemingly intuitive, introduce usability challenges</a> designers solved decades ago in GUI design. The “blank page problem” remains acute: users often don’t know what to type to get ideal output, and the burden of articulating intent shifts entirely to the user.</p><h4><strong>Pattern 2: Natural language interface as contextual action block</strong></h4><p>Contextual input area, not a full chat interface. A natural language input component appears near your selection or as a menu option</p><figure><img alt=""Four-panel grid showing AI-assisted creation across different tools: Figma with an “Describe your edit” prompt, Notion with inline AI writing suggestions, Photoshop with a generative image fill prompt over a blurred image, and Wispr Flow displaying voice dictation converting speech into text."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*64GJWusQ_N1eIgdBjb3aXw.png"" /><figcaption>AI-assisted workflows across <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7373707174193156096/"">Figma</a>, <a href=""https://www.notion.com/help/guides/notion-ai-for-docs"">Notion</a>, <a href=""https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/generative-fill.html"">Photoshop</a>, and <a href=""https://wisprflow.ai/"">Wispr Flow</a></figcaption></figure><p>Gulf of execution happens through language interface, but gulf of evaluation happens visually on the canvas. There’s typically no conversation history in this space (can be stored and displayed in different interface seciton), each prompt is a fresh, contextual interaction. The canvas remains the primary work surface; natural language is just another input method within your existing workflow. This pattern often references context implicitly, bundling related information into single commands which Tang terms “<a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/emerging-interaction-patterns-in-generative-ai-experiences-8c351bb3392a"">context bundling</a>” to reduce typing burden while preserving</p><p><strong><em>Things to be aware of</em>: </strong>Pattern 2 treats each language prompt as a discrete action command tied to the workspace . For example, “summarize this selection” or “generate chart from this table”. This mean the pattern often reference context implicitly. it often struggles to integrate rich external context (like files, multiple references, or tool chains) and doesn’t naturally support deep follow-up refinement through language alone.</p><h4>Pattern 3: Natural language interface as control panel</h4><p>Having a persistent conversational panel alongside a workspace helps with iterative refinement and visibility of results. This dedicated chat composer provides a full, persistent conversational interface with message history. The system interprets the request, plans a sequence of actions from the converstation panel and executes them in a separate workspace</p><figure><img alt=""Four-panel screenshot showing an AI-assisted development workflow: Cursor AI editing a React/TypeScript codebase with inline suggestions, and OpenAI ChatGPT Atlas in agent mode executing tasks"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aA7XTemjn2iJ5Hzlw80cHg.png"" /><figcaption>Agent-driven workflows using <a href=""https://cursor.com/agents"">Cursor AI </a>and OpenAI <a href=""https://chatgpt.com/atlas/"">ChatGPT Atlas</a></figcaption></figure><p>Gulf of execution and gulf of evaluation are bridged across separate spaces. You execute through conversation in one space, but you evaluate by watching both the external workspace and reading feedback in the chat. This creates a supervisory relationship where the natural language interface is your control mechanism while work happens elsewhere. Users must monitor both spaces to fully understand what happened. Design principle from <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/ai-ux-design-for-intelligent-interfaces-bc966e96107d"">article written by Basu</a> emphasize how to provide clear indicators of what the agent is doing in the background, so users feel in control even when the system is proactive. Interpretation requires synthesizing information from the workspace (seeing what changed) and the chat (reading what the system did and why). The control panel enables iteration that you can refine, redirect, or build on previous turns while the agent continues working.</p><p>Agent Advancements like Anthropic’s <a href=""https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use"">Computer Use</a>, OpenAI’s <a href=""https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/"">Operator</a>, Google’s <a href=""https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-computer-use-model/"">Computer Space</a>, operates an entire computer or browser interface while you supervise from the chat panel. You provide high-level instructions (“book a restaurant reservation for Friday”), and the agent navigates websites, fills forms, and completes multi-step tasks. As these agents become more autonomous, the tension between letting them work and maintaining meaningful control becomes more acute, echoing the classic debate between direct manipulation and interface agents that <a href=""https://pienso.com/blog/direct-manipulation-vs-interface-agents-revisiting-the-classic-debate-decades-later"">Pienso</a> revisited in their 2024 analysis.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram comparing three natural language interface patterns.

These approaches differ fundamentally because they either don’t sustain the interaction (intent capture is just an entry point) or don’t require active natural language input (the instruction is predefined in the button).</p><h3>Reflections: How tools are built today and what’s ahead</h3><p>Looking at tools launched in 2024–2025, most follow a familiar structure: <a href=""https://www.thirteen23.com/updates/the-prompt-box-paradox"">start with an intent capture page</a> (templates, starter prompts), then route users to either Pattern 1 for conversational tasks or Pattern 3 for agent-driven work. Pattern 2 appears as embedded features within existing tools.</p><p>As tools mature, frequently-used prompts get “promoted” into buttons such as “Improve Writing,” “Summarize,” “Translate.” Natural language coexists with traditional UI, reducing friction for common tasks while preserving flexibility for open-ended prompting.</p><p>This structure isn’t entirely new, it mirrors how traditional software has been built for decades. Classic tools also started with an onboarding or template selection page, then moved users into the main workflow interface. The difference now is that within that workflow page, natural language acts as a new control layer, either as a control panel (Pattern 3) orchestrating work, or as an action bar (Pattern 2) augmenting existing canvas-based workflows.</p><h4>What patterns might emerge?</h4><p>As we move through 2026, one interesting question that strikes my mind is that, how will human intervention and interaction loop in these AI tools evolve?</p><figure><img alt=""Animated GIF showing a human finger and a robotic finger reaching toward each other against a cosmic sky background, symbolizing connection between humans and machines."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/0*in9E65KC0ifJVc5V.gif"" /></figure><p>Many tools have started addressing intervention, but few experiences have become overwhelming with multiple pause points, confirmation dialogs, and approval gates. The challenge is making intervention intuitive and natural, not just possible. Also, the users need to develop an strong mental model for when to step in versus when to trust the agent.</p><p>Also supervision isn’t enough. The real challenge is understanding <em>how and why the agent made changes</em>, a concern central to <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/guidelines-for-human-ai-interaction/"">Microsoft Research’s guidelines for human-AI interaction</a>.</p><blockquote>As agents become more capable, we risk creating dependency where users accomplish tasks but don’t understand the underlying work.</blockquote><p>This is critical for people learning new skills</p><p>When an agent generates code or modifies a design, users need to comprehend the reasoning: not just “lines 45–67 changed,” but “here’s why this approach, here’s the trade-off, here’s what else was considered.” Yet there’s a critical gap: agents can provide these explanations, but users still need foundational knowledge to fully grasp them. An explanation of why a particular code structure was chosen doesn’t help if you don’t understand fundamentals.</p><p>Without this understanding, users can’t effectively intervene, correct, or extend the work. They become dependent on the agent to modify its own output.Aubergine (2025) calls this the “<a href=""https://www.aubergine.co/insights/designing-for-ai-agents"">learning arc</a>” problem.</p><p>By designing systems that show learning progression, users experience agents as reliable collaborators that grow alongside them, not opaque black boxes.</p><p>The next generation of interaction model needs to balance efficiency with transparency. The design goal shifts from “make AI do the work” to “help users understand what’s being done and how they could do it themselves,” addressing what researchers at CHI 2020 identified as the <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376301"">unique difficulties in designing human-AI interaction</a>.</p><p>As product builders, our task is to observe how these interaction patterns perform, understand where they succeed and struggle, and continue pushing toward interfaces that make powerful tools that leverages accessibility, learnability and human control.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=8b39ed123c39"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/beyond-conversations-natural-language-as-interaction-influencer-8b39ed123c39"">Beyond conversations: natural language as interaction influencer</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>“The medium is the message” — Marshall McLuhan</h4><figure><img alt=""“How the Tools We Use Change the Products we Design” — banner image."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-H8x4axWhYP0QCL9rRws4w.png"" /><figcaption>Background art by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1876.</figcaption></figure><p>Every era of product design on the web brings with it new design tools, these tools change how we design websites and also influences the next generation of design tools to come.</p><p>I know it seems like a novel idea for some of you reading this, you might think you design the websites you want to design and you’re only limited by your imagination, but you’re only half-right.</p><p>That’s somewhat true but also you’re human and all humans are lazy sometimes and we like to design websites that are easily designed and easily developed, we don’t like friction, as any designer who studied UX already knows.</p><p>So as Marshall McLuhan once said “The medium is the message”, meaning that our ever-changing medium does box us into certain realities as we approach the tools for web design.</p><p>In this article I’ll try to go over the different tools for designing the web as they were used in chronological order, of course some of these tools got used simultaneously so there is no clean cut.</p><p>But I’ll do my best to paint the history of web design tools in stages as I lived through them, so let’s begin.</p><p>First, we had plain HTML.</p><h3>HTML</h3><p>Before any design tool ever existed, there was HTML, it was (and still is) the most fundamental building material of the web.</p><p>When HTML was the only way to design websites we had WYSIWYG interfaces to better move around what was essentially just HTML tags like paragraphs, headings, tables and images.</p><p>CSS didn’t exist yet so all the styling was done inside of the actual HTML itself (remember <em>bgcolor</em>?) and the only way to center anything was to use tables and make their borders invisible.</p><p>In some ways simple HTML styling lives on today in email newsletters and passion projects but the web itself has moved on to better things.</p><p>Websites of this area were made to emphasis the tags and their aesthetics were unique with lots of GIFs, lots or background images that repeated themselves endlessly, and of course some background music to set the mood.</p><p>The most well known offender in this category of early 90s websites was GeoCities, which did offer a WYSIWYG editor for everybody to use for free.</p><figure><img alt=""GeoCities web editor was one of the first publicly available WYSIWYG editors."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/0*YLJ_Xt0xreCr6UIh"" /><figcaption>GeoCities web editor was one of the first publicly available WYSIWYG editors.</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=""Netscape Composer live edits, image from Pier-Luc Brault’s Blog."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*83CyO7vFFtTOROrC.png"" /><figcaption>Netscape Composer live edits, image from Pier-Luc Brault’s Blog (<a href=""https://plbrault.com/blog-posts/i-used-netscape-composer-in-2024/"">Link</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Websites of that era were built for Netscape or later for Internet Explorer, nobody ever tried to make their websites cross compatible and they all just worked sometimes.</p><p>These compatibility issues often occurred while using specific tags (that aren’t in use anymore) like lots of <em>marquee</em> tags, <em>framesets</em>, <em>blink</em> tags and more.</p><p>Those were visually unique but ultimately were deprecated for accessibility and/ or security reasons, so we could only find them in early web design relics.</p><p>Speaking of security concerns, then came Flash</p><h3>Flash</h3><p>When Macromedia Flash (later — Adobe Flash) became the standard tool everyone was both a designer and a developer, Flash had its own scripting language called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript""><em>ActionScript</em></a> and it’s own animation-driven interface.</p><p>As a result people started replacing their entire websites with Flash sites, these sites were very animated and very tailored to their needs, no more templates and no more copying HTML tags from one another (Flash sites were nutritiously closed off — unlike HTML “<em>view source</em>” feature)</p><p>Flash transformed the web more than any other tool, it made the entire web dependent on its proprietary technology, it made us all developers and animators, and sometimes even game designers.</p><p>As a result those sites were often bloated, since optimization was optional, and they were very unfriendly to SEO, since it was all closed off.</p><figure><img alt=""Newgrounds landing page from the early 2000s."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/0*6Uw-fXM3AN3_hkeX.jpg"" /><figcaption>Newgrounds — If you know, you know.</figcaption></figure><p>But the Flash era was the most creative the web had even been, Flash websites could do pretty much anything we could imagine, Flash games were also a big thing in the mid-2000s, see Newgrounds website above.</p><p>Flash is still alive in the form of Adobe Animate, but today it’s less geared towards websites, since the web had moved on — partly since the web moved to a mobile first web.</p><p>Flash websites were bloated and had security issues but above all else: they weren’t responsive enough to survive in the mobile internet era, when screen real estate and battery life were much more scarce.</p><p>I encourage everyone to read “<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20170615060422/https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/"">Thoughts on Flash</a>” by Steve Jobs, it sums the problems with Flash on mobile devices nicely.</p><h3>Photoshop / Illustrator</h3><p>Photoshop and Illustrator are both Adobe products, they weren’t new at this point but the industry defaulted to them when Flash was on its deathbed.</p><p>When Flash was no longer the dominant design tool for the web, nothing could really fill its place, so the industry moved on to the tools that were already proven to stick around.</p><p>This era of web design felt especially static, as designers only designed Desktop and Mobile websites, with often nothing in between, keep in mind that iPads weren’t a thing yet and/ or just came out.</p><figure><img alt=""An Illustrator-designed website, it was never great."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*3aY-7j9JtQ37VdXa"" /><figcaption>An Illustrator-designed website, it was never great.</figcaption></figure><p>Everything was done manually using hard labor, no automation, no tools to make the process any easier, certainly no specialized tools yet.</p><p>Photoshop and Illustrator are general purpose software — Photoshop is for editing images and Illustrator is for editing vector shapes, none of them were made for web design specifically.</p><p>As a result they had many tools that were irrelevant to Product Design and many relevant tools were missing.</p><p>These relevant/ irrelevant tools were the blueprint for the next generation of tools, that built upon the workflow of Photoshop/ Illustrator and decided what tools to include and what tools to exclude.</p><p>Photoshop and Illustrator as web design tools were never great tools for the job, but they were great at being placeholders until some more specialized tools arrived.</p><h3>Sketch</h3><p>Sketch, for many designers, was just that — a new tool built from the ground up for Product Design (or UI Design, as it was called then). Sketch didn’t have the bloat Photoshop and Illustrator had since it was purpose built.</p><figure><img alt=""Sketch circa 2017, image from Newbird"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*LduuUHZW42-rfbQ5.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Sketch circa 2017, image from Newbird (<a href=""https://newbird.com/digital-design-tool-review-sketch-app/"">Link</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The application itself and the tools in it were lean and were exactly what users wanted. I didn’t get into Sketch although a lot of my friends and colleagues did. Sketch was (and still is) a Mac only application so I knew it can’t be the tool of the future.</p><p>There were entire industries built on Windows PCs and the Mac-only Sketch were making a lot of problems in their pipelines, for example: the gaming industry, the data security industry, AR &amp; VR (at the time), the banking industry etc.</p><p>Sketch did a lot of things right but eventually the one thing it did was making the entire design industry reconsider the tools they use.</p><p>Sketch walked so Figma could run.</p><h3>Figma</h3><p>Figma wasn’t just a cross-platform version of Sketch, Figma took the formula that Sketch made of lean and precise design tool specifically made for UI design and expanded upon it.</p><figure><img alt=""Figma in 2019, image from OneSignal"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*bd9eOPG0mhlINjkR.jpg"" /><figcaption>Figma in 2019, image from OneSignal (<a href=""https://onesignal.com/blog/designing-with-figma/"">Link</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>It was a new kind of tool — it was an online first tool, Figma was available from your browser, without any installation (when it did that, it was all new and exciting, I know today it’s more common).</p><p>Since it was all online, Figma files could also be shared and worked on together, Figma had the most advanced “multiplayer” tools I’ve ever seen, which meant designers can work together on the same design file and in the same time, since it was all online.</p><p>Think of Google Docs, you can also edit the same file in Google Docs, or the same code in a Git repository, for example, but Figma brought the same philosophy into a design tool and since then many tools tried to do the same.</p><p>Since Figma tried to be lean (much like Sketch before it), many tools were dropped in the process, no more photo editing tools, limited filters, limited Motion Design tools, no 3D tools etc.</p><p>On the other side many new tools were introduced, responsive design controls for every frame, a prototyping tool and auto-layout controls — just to name a few.</p><figure><img alt=""An example of responsive design in Figma."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/610/0*LTf-cs6mmbWU2up_.png"" /><figcaption>An example of responsive design in Figma.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, Figma was very “flat” looking by design and more detailed work was harder to achieve, many still used Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop for detail design and many just gave up and embraced the flatness.</p><p>Since advanced Motion, Animations or working with 3D elements is virtually impossible in Figma and as a result, those elements are very rare to see in the web today.</p><p>I would argue that to this day, features like Motion Design and 3D work are still missing since they weren’t present in the original catch-all tools Photoshop/ Illustrator and as a result they are still missing from Figma today.</p><p>Just to be clear — I am not against any of it, I like flat design and I think intelligent design can be done in any style and in any medium, regardless of the rendered output, when I say “<em>flat</em>” I don’t mean it as a criticism — just as a visual observation.</p><h3>Closing words</h3><p>From no tools for design, through WYSIWYG and Flash, Photoshop/ Illustrator, Sketch and of course Figma it was quite a ride.</p><p>The tools change not only <strong>how</strong> we design interactive websites but <strong>what</strong> we design as well, including how they look, how they work and how the users experience them. No website is made in a vacuum.</p><p>We can clearly see how the tools of each era influenced the design of the websites below, they are all promotional websites that were designed when the movie released.</p><figure><img alt=""Space Jam official movie website, 1996."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/544/0*oGSAc-WnPMYG5AfQ.png"" /><figcaption>Space Jam official movie website, 1996.</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=""What is The Matrix — official movie website, 1999."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/830/1*vkyS5ePhZTj81kAdPnRkcw.png"" /><figcaption>What is The Matrix — official movie website, 1999.</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=""John Wick official movie website, 2014."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*l9mstz6xGkAUQPbJUKETNA.png"" /><figcaption>John Wick official movie website, 2014.</figcaption></figure><p>The first example (Space Jam) used HTML and WYSIWYG tools and the result is a more fined version of GeoCities websites, with the repeated background image and the secluded elements.</p><p>The Matrix example was done in the era of Flash and it has many TVs showing small clips from the movie, notice how they don’t really design a UI but they design a “world” you can go visit.</p><p>The Last example — John Wick is modern design that was probably done with Figma, it is highly reusable, probably using the same template as any other movie and it is a UI with text, titles, menu and even a video in a rectangular shape, how long have we come indeed.</p><p>It can be said that any creative industry is bound to change, the history of painting and art in general is full of these examples — how the invention of oil colors gave a way to the renaissance masters to shine, how watercolors freed the impressionists from their studio to go paint outside and so on.</p><figure><img alt=""Finally out of the studio and into the bar.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952690.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p>Until a few weeks ago, I was faithfully using a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tretinoin-skin-benefits-risks"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">prescription retinoid</a> recommended by a trusted dermatologist — and my skin had never looked worse. My first mistake was assuming that, having <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glow-recipe-blackberry-retinol-blemish-serum-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">used retinol before</a>, I wouldn’t experience the harsh side effects of a stronger formula. But when my skin wouldn’t stop peeling, my breakouts got worse, and I was almost out of the tube, I knew something was off. So when The Inkey List’s new <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fadvanced-retinol-us-P520381%3F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Advanced 0.2% Retinal</a> landed on my desk, promising a fast yet gentle experience for retinoid users, I knew I had to give it a try. </p>



<h2>What is The Inkey List’s Advanced 0.2% Retinal, and what are the benefits? </h2>



<p>Without getting all lab-coat on you (and before I get into the nitty gritty), it helps to know the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">difference between retin<em>al</em> </a>— the star ingredient in The Inkey List’s new serum — and retin<em>ol</em>. Both are members of the retinoid family, but they work a little differently.  </p>



<p>Esthetician <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/alicia.lartey/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Alicia Lartey</a> previously explained to R29 that when retinol is applied to the skin, it <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">goes through several steps</a> before being converted into retinoic acid, which triggers all the amazing skin benefits, like improving texture and tone, minimizing fine lines by boosting collagen production, and reducing breakouts by renewing skin cells. Retinal, on the other hand, requires fewer steps to become retinoic acid, so it works faster — 11 times faster, according to The Inkey List. It’s the retinal that gives this serum its striking yellow color, but don’t worry — it hasn’t gone bad, and though it’s a little reminiscent of a turmeric face mask, it absorbs instantly and won’t stain your skin. I can vouch for that.  </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fadvanced-retinol-us-P520381"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Inkey List Advanced 0.2% Retinal Serum, $15</a></h2>

<h2>What makes The Inkey List’s Advanced 0.2 Retinal special? </h2>



<p>Even better, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP520381"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Inkey List’s retinal</a> is encapsulated, meaning it’s wrapped in tiny moisturizing molecules that release it gradually into the skin. This way, you get all the benefits of a high-powered ingredient with far less irritation — no soreness or painfully dry, flaky patches here.  </p>



<p>Just when I thought this product couldn’t get any smarter, it also features 1% symsitive, a soothing ingredient that supports the skin barrier (the outer layer that keeps moisture in and bacteria out). This is a relief, as retinoids can easily damage the skin barrier if used incorrectly or too often. Plus, there’s 2% sirtalice, an algae-derived ingredient that helps firm the skin in minutes, making it appear juicy and plump.  </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>What to know about The Inkey List’s 0.2% Advanced Retinal serum</h3>



<p>— Features 0.2% encapsulated retinal, a high-strength ingredient that works faster than retinol with minimal irritation. </p>



<p>— Targets dark spots, rough skin texture, fine lines, and breakouts. </p>



<p>— Designed for evening use: two to three times a week at first. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>How do you use The Inkey List’s Advanced 0.2 Retinal, and is it worth it?  </h2>



<p>I’ve been using <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP520381"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Advanced 0.2% Retinal</a> for a few weeks now (a pea-sized amount three nights a week, right after cleansing and before a simple moisturizer), and my skin is already much happier. It’s clearer, bouncier, smoother in texture, and more even in tone, thanks to the retinal helping minimize the red marks left behind by breakouts. Here, I’m wearing a light touch of concealer and blush, and can comfortably skip foundation.</p>



<p>With my skin feeling less dry, the fine lines under my eyes and across my forehead have eased up, too. I even bring it down my neck to help zap the occasional hormonal zit. My neck is the first place to feel sensitive when I use retinoids because the skin is thinner here, but so far, I’ve not experienced any irritation. </p>



<p>It’s a lightweight serum, so you’ll want to make sure the moisturizer you apply on top in the evening is fairly simple and doesn’t contain high-strength actives like exfoliating acids. Good options include <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fsos-daily-skin-barrier-redness-recovery-moisturizer-P506470"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tower 28 SOS Daily Skin Barrier Redness Recovery Moisturizer</a> or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fthe-ordinary-deciem-natural-moisturizing-factors-ha-P427414"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + Hyaluronic Acid</a>. I’m also a fan of <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fthe-inkey-list-bio-active-ceramide-repairing-plumping-moisturizer-P509315"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Inkey List’s Bio-Active Ceramide Repairing and Plumping Moisturizer</a>. </p>





<p>My top tip for anyone using this serum is to continue using a high-factor, broad-spectrum sunscreen in the daytime because retinoids make skin more sensitive to sunlight. Yep, even in the fall and winter months. </p>



<p>You can always count on The Inkey List not to leave anyone out, and there’s good news for retinoid beginners, too. Alongside its buzzy new retinal, the brand has also unveiled a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fstarter-retinol-us-P520372"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Starter Retinol Serum</a>, just as affordable at $14. With 1% granactive retinoid (a gentler, also encapsulated form) and 0.01% retinal, it’s kinder on sensitive skin — even for those with rosacea — thanks to additional soothing ingredients like glycerin and symrelief 100 (made from chamomile and ginger root). While it’s pretty new, the five-star reviews speak for themselves. </p>

<h2>Best Work Tote Bags</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953190.png?width=806&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=403%3A512"" /></figure>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-tote-bags"">Tote bags</a> have cemented their status as a standout choice for work, and for good reason. The spacious style can carry so much, and, when designed for work, have extra compartments, pockets, pouches, and zippers to help organize your belongings. We’re partial to leather totes because of their chicness and longevity, but less expansive alternatives like nylon and polyester make a case for durability. Whether you opt for a boxy or bucket shape, any of these options will surely become your go-to work companion.  </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Best Work Laptop Bags</h2>

<p>If you really mean business, opt for a laptop bag with handy dividers, sleeves, and compartments. From totes to briefcases, these designs keep <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-designers-fashion-technology"">your tech</a> secure, your accessories perfectly organized, and your on-the-go style sharp. (Many are also available in multiple sizes to fit 13-inch or 16-inch laptops.)  </p>

<p>Looking to get a work bag that’ll last you many years to come? It may be worth investing in a luxe leather style from a designer brand. From Polène’s bestselling Cyme sculptural bag to Mansur Gavriel’s signature <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mansur-gavriel-candy-bag-review-promo-code-deal"">Candy hobo bag</a>, some iconic handbags prove they’re very versatile and can be worn from work to dinner. Seek out oversized styles, high-quality leather, and sturdy straps to ensure you’re getting the most bang for your buck.  </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Best Work Backpacks</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953240.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-lululemon-bags-belt-crossbody-tote-duffle"">Backpacks</a> are our top pick for city commuters, but they don’t have to feel blah or grade-school-inspired. Consider tried-and-true, water-repellant (and washable!) fabrics in streamlined designs or more sophisticated pebbled leather and quilted fabrics to upgrade your look. Features like adjustable shoulder straps, metal hardware, laptop sleeves, and water bottle pockets are the cherry on top of a commuter-friendly and work-appropriate backpack. </p>

<p>When it comes to business trips, bags with suitcase sleeves are a must. And these zippered options — from oversized totes to mini duffle bags — combine organized interiors with travel-smart features, like water-repellant fabrics and tons of compartments. Ideal for navigating terminals and heading straight to meetings, these travel work bags are the perfect blend of style and functionality. </p>

<p>Channel the sophistication of the ’30s to ’60s with structured top-handle bags, curved (trendy) bowling bags, or slim briefcases that blend vintage charm with modern refinement. And thankfully, many of these styles come with detachable straps so you can also wear them as shoulder and crossbody bags. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953299.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p>I’ve always heard that Singapore has one of the most beautiful airports in the world, but what no one told me is that I’d fall in love with everything else, too. From the food and architecture to the people and its overall vibe, Singapore completely <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/portugal-reminded-me-i-deserve-luxury"">exceeded my expectations</a>. When I landed, I was already plotting my return flight. Honestly, I’d go back tomorrow if I could. </p>



<p> But let’s start at the beginning. The most daunting part of my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-travel-pants"">journey was the flight</a>. Eighteen hours nonstop from New York is no joke. It’s the longest nonstop flight in the world. I was nervous, to say the least. But flying Singapore Airlines in business class changed everything. I slept like a baby. No exaggeration, this was the most comfortable I’ve ever been on a plane. The service was flawless, and the food menu felt more like dining at a restaurant than airline meals. If you’re making the trek, I highly recommend splurging on business class. Your body will thank you.</p>



<p>I was also worried about the weather. Singapore is known for its heat and humidity; and humidity and me do not mix. Thankfully, I packed light, breathable fabrics that didn’t betray me when the sweat arrived. Preparation is everything.</p>



<h2><strong>Day 1: First Impressions &amp; Instant Obsession</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953400.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p>After a long but incredibly comfortable flight, we landed in Singapore and headed straight to <a href=""https://www.qthotels.com/singapore/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=gmb""><strong>QT Singapore</strong></a>. The hotel was gorgeously decorated for the holidays, modern, chic, and thoughtfully designed down to every last detail. After a much-needed nap, we kicked things off at <a href=""https://www.marinabaysands.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=GMB&amp;utm_campaign=hotel_info_main""><strong>Marina Bay Sands</strong></a>, which is a hotel, mall, restaurant hub, and convention center all in one. The scale alone is jaw-dropping.</p>



<p>Lunch felt like the right place to start, so we <a href=""https://www.jumboseafood.com.sg/en/home""><strong>went to Jumbo</strong></a>, famously known for its chili crab. We didn’t get to try that dish, but everything we ordered was still a hit. After some light shopping, we wrapped the evening with <a href=""https://www.marcys.sg/""><strong>dinner at Marcy’s</strong></a>, a popular Italian spot where the food was a solid 10/10. For drinks, we ended the night at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sagohouse.sg/?hl=en""><strong>Sago House</strong></a>, where hip-hop and R&amp;B played all night. I was genuinely surprised by how at home I felt.</p>



<h2><strong>Day 2: Tourist Mode (Happily) Activated</strong></h2>



<p>We leaned all the way into sightseeing, starting at <a href=""https://www.visitsingapore.com/neighbourhood/featured-neighbourhood/marina-bay/merlion-park/""><strong>Merlion Park </strong></a>for the iconic photo with the half-lion, half-fish statue. One of my favorite parts of traveling is doing things I’d never do at home. Times Square? Absolutely not. But in Singapore, even locals visit the landmarks and everything is spotless. (Fun fact: littering is illegal.)</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953344.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p>Next up was Chinatown, which exists everywhere in the world and still manages to feel special in every city. It was the perfect place to grab souvenirs. We continued our city tour with a temple visit, matcha stops (very American of us), and dinner at <a href=""https://www.thecoconutclub.sg/""><strong>Coconut Club</strong></a>, where the food was another easy 10/10. I ate a lot of meat and rice but somehow didn’t feel bloated. Back home, I’d be reaching for Tums immediately.</p>



<h2><strong>Day 3: Culture, Food &amp; Feeling Safe</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953347.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p>This day was all about understanding Singaporean culture, starting with a food tour at a local hawker center. Think open-air food courts with multiple vendors serving traditional dishes and here’s the kicker: most Singaporeans don’t cook. Eating at hawker centers is cheaper and more convenient than cooking at home. We tried dish after dish, but my favorite came from a Michelin-starred chef named <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/cheflup_roasted/?hl=en""><strong>Chef Lup</strong></a>. I’m still thinking about that roasted pork.</p>



<p>One of the most fascinating cultural differences I witnessed: Saving seats. People simply leave a personal item on a chair or table, and no one takes it. That would never work in New York. I felt incredibly safe the entire time, which is something that truly stood out as a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-british-women-travel-self-esteem"">Black woman traveling abroad</a>.</p>



<p>That evening, we had dinner at<strong> </strong><a href=""https://sg.celavi.com/""><strong>CÉ LA VI</strong></a>, a rooftop spot with sweeping city views. Between the skyline and the fact that Singapore is 13 hours ahead, it genuinely felt like I was in the future. We were standing in one of the tallest buildings in the world, taking it all in.</p>



<h2><strong>Day 5: Thrills, Screams &amp; R&amp;B</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953348.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p>We spent the day at <a href=""https://www.rwsentosa.com/en/play/universal-studios-singapore""><strong>Universal Studios Singapore</strong></a>, fully embracing our inner kids. I’ll admit, I am not a roller coaster person. But I said yes anyway and immediately regretted it. The Revenge of the Mummy ride had me questioning every life choice I’ve ever made. My boyfriend was having the time of his life while I screamed and held on for dear life. Still, it was worth it just to say I went to Universal Studios on another continent.</p>



<p>That night, we headed to dinner at <a href=""https://www.mamadiamsg.com/menu""><strong>Mama Diam</strong></a>, a speakeasy disguised as a corner store that opens into a sleek, modern space playing R&amp;B all night. I love a speakeasy night out. It’s one of my favorite activities in New York. Singapore really knows how to make you feel at home, even when you’re halfway across the world.</p>



<h3><strong>Day 6: Gin, Spa Bliss &amp; Caribbean Roots</strong></h3>



<p>Our final day might’ve been my favorite. We visited <a href=""https://brassliondistillery.com/pages/gin-school?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=22936484064&amp;utm_content=183877836945&amp;utm_term=gin%20workshop%20singapore&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22936484064&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACcdwB9T2T9MiR5AdB9q73dTtlrAf&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAgvPKBhCxARIsAOlK_EpJnOlG9TFjP426InfGx5mEV29gkCyo0PTXr29KrIngL81tzS87iekaAv42EALw_wcB""><strong>Brass Lion Gin</strong></a>, the first Singaporean gin distillery, where we learned how to make gin from scratch in three hours. I’ve never been much of a gin girl (outside of the occasional French 75), but that changed quickly. I created a floral gin blend that is beautifully sitting on my bar car. And yes, I brought a bottle back to the U.S., where it’s not even sold yet.</p>

<p>After one too many taste tests, it was time to unwind. I booked a spa treatment and got the best massage of my life. The masseuse climbed on the table to get every knot out of my body. I wanted to pack her in my suitcase and bring her home.</p>



<p>We ended the trip on the highest note with dinner at <a href=""https://www.campcaribbean.co/""><strong>Camp Caribbean</strong></a>, a Black-owned Jamaican and Trinidadian restaurant. As a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/09/11116863/nurse-turned-chef-healthy-recipes-boundaries"">Caribbean American</a> woman, seeing my culture reflected in Singapore meant everything. I was very impressed by how good the food tasted. The head chef traveled the world cooking before settling there and it was the perfect full-circle moment to close out the trip.</p>



<h3><strong>Why Singapore Belongs on Your Bucket List</strong></h3>

<p>I’ve traveled to many countries, but Singapore stands out. As a Black woman, it’s one of the safest places I’ve ever visited, and the people are genuinely welcoming. Whether you’re <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/08/11929596/tracee-ellis-ross-solo-traveling-mexico-travel-diary"">traveling solo,</a> planning a baecation, or organizing a group trip, Singapore truly has something for everyone. If you needed a sign to book that flight, this is it.</p>

<p>The moment I stepped into adulthood, my after-school routine of endless dance and drama classes fell entirely by the wayside. Instead, once I started working full time, I’d go to the pub and then head home for my all important <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9889706/social-media-sleep-deprivation"">looking-at-phone-in-bed time</a>. </p>



<p>This summer though, I finally decided to dip my toe back into the world of organized fun by <em>casually</em> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/04/9670512/best-yoga-mat"">taking up yoga</a> with the intention of simply helping myself unwind in a healthy way. My semi-regular relationship with the activity means that I still set up my mat at the back of class, don’t know the proper Sanskrit names for the poses, and mostly copy the person in front of me. But that’s exactly what keeps me engaged with the practice: The blissful, no-pressure, low intensity of it all (especially in January).</p>



<p>For 28-year-old Refinery29 writer Esther Newman, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/embroidery-hobby-coming-out-bisexuality"">taking up embroidery</a> without the pressure to get better at it has been a big plus for her mental health. “I find it really soothing and calming, having something to channel my nervous energy into, especially something that’s physical and not screen related,” she explains. “I like having something creative and artistic that’s all my own and that I don’t have to qualify through its performance or a rating judged by someone else. It’s just me who gets to say whether something works or needs a different approach.” </p>



<p>For many others though, the approach to hobbies is more all or nothing. Research from <a href=""https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/news-from-the-bhf/news-archive/2019/january/britains-hobbies-have-a-shelf-life-of-16-months"">The British Heart Foundation</a> shows that the shelf life of adult hobbies in the U.K. is 16 months, noting that work commitments, busy family lives, and lack of motivation are the main reasons we let them slide. The societal pressure to be instantly great at something is likely a contributing factor in our apathy towards hobbies. How many times have you heard someone saying <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/running-for-beginners-tips"">they want to start running</a>, only for every conversation to become about Fitbits and training for a half marathon? The very idea that you don’t have to be brilliant at everything you do seems to have gotten lost in our never-ending grind culture.</p>



<p>But why can’t our hobbies just be… Fun? In a world where we’re constantly on the clock or our iPhones, measuring our successes to our timelines and group chats, shouldn’t hobbies simply be a space for relaxation? According to therapist and <a href=""https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Counseling Directory</a> member Rose Fisher, engaging in hobbies on a more chilled basis is not only more enjoyable, but it can also be a major win for our minds. “Taking up casual hobbies simply for the joy of it is important for our overall mental health and wellbeing,” she tells Refinery29. The benefits of engaging in an activity for no other reason than fun allows us to achieve what she calls a flow state: That is, engrossed and focused on a single task, according to Fisher, which allows us to be fully present and rid ourselves of self-consciousness.</p>



<p>This, she adds, in turn, helps to calm down our “thinking mind.” “The prefrontal cortex decreases in activity when an individual reaches a state of flow and this reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex enables us to be more creative and also think more freely,” Fisher explains.</p>



<p>While it might seem like a strange concept for our overstimulated brains, it is possible to go back to picking up and putting down hobbies when and if we feel like it. Just because we might have invested time into something, it doesn’t mean we have to force ourselves to continue with an enjoyable routine. The idea of having to commit fully to something, reach goals and engage with it “properly” is exactly what moves us away from the flow state, creating a feeling of unnecessary expectation and guilt if we don’t reach those markers.</p>



<p>Getting back to that source of exploration was something that 27-year-old aerial performer <a href=""https://www.rubylauren.com/"">Ruby Baker</a> has experienced since taking up piano last month. “I love learning something new for the sake of it. There’s no pressure and it allows me to take my mind off all the other things I have to do,” she says. “I’m a bit of a perfectionist so it’s really good for me to try something I’m not good at and have a laugh with it. It takes away any self-criticism and judgment and reminds me that there’s no right or wrong when you’re creating art.”</p>



<p>One of the main reasons that hobbies began to feel so much like work is due in a large part to the evolution of the side hustle. Bolstered by never-ending COVID lockdowns, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/04/10942275/good-interesting-tiktok-accounts"">TikTok feeds</a> where everyone seems to be turning their knitting hobby into cold hard cash, for many the opportunity to make money has come at the price of falling out of love with their chosen activity. “Adding financial pressures to a passion, or setting high goals for a hobby can have a negative impact on our fulfillment, as it takes away the simplicity of engaging with the task just for the pleasure of it,” Fisher explains.</p>



<p>Just because yoga brings me joy by engaging with a hobby in a casual, friends-with-benefits kind of way doesn’t mean I don’t feel the ongoing threat to commit and level up. In <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/no-cost-of-living-raise-paycheck-budget"">a cost of living crisis</a> where extracurriculars are increasingly expensive (my membership is $50 a month), the feeling that activities must be productive to be worth doing has never felt stronger, which is precisely what keeps most of us from taking them up or sticking to them.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>It is very important to have some experiences in life that are not about achieving goals, proving ourselves, or winning at things.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>For 29-year-old radio presenter <a href=""https://www.marymandefield.com/"">Mary Mandefield</a>, this is one of the reasons her recent bouldering hobby has been kept casual. “I’m a big believer in not making money from the things you really love. As soon as something turns into a hustle or a career, it can suck the joy from it. I used to be a dance teacher, and as much as I loved making some extra money from dancing around with my mates, I quickly learnt that having to think about insurance, marketing, and GDPR [general data protection regulation] made it less fun,” she tells Refinery29.</p>



<p>“It is very important to have some experiences in life that are not about achieving goals, proving ourselves, or winning at things,” Fisher explains. “These activities help us to remember that our worth does not depend on what we can do, and we don’t have to prove ourselves to be impressive, valuable, or useful in every aspect of our lives.” </p>



<p>24-year-old designer Georgina<strong>*</strong>, who previously went out running every day, recognizes her relationship with the activity is much better now that it’s more relaxed. “It used to feel like a chore and I believed that if I missed a run then everything would be ruined. Not only my progress… It was more like: okay, that was a wasted day because I didn’t run my five miles,” she says. “Now, I don’t want to run because I ‘planned’ it, but just do it when I feel I need it. I actually enjoy it without the demand of getting better and I really don’t want to spoil that magic. It’s so comforting to do something just for yourself without any kind of pressure, whether that be internal or external.”</p>



<p>While it might take some mental reframing to break free of our overachieving mindsets, seeing hobbies as less of a routine-orientated practice and more as a source of play is a start. According to therapist and Counseling Directory member <a href=""https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/counsellors/rosalind-miles"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Rosalind Miles</a>, the social aspect is also incredibly important. “Hobbies often bring people together who share similar interests,” she says. “Joining clubs or participating in group activities related to your hobby can foster a sense of community and provide opportunities for people to get out and about and make new friends.”</p>



<p>As January brings with it unending conversations about what we want to “achieve” this year, giving ourselves permission to engage with activities we like on a “when we feel like it” basis seems like one way to actually keep going with them. The inherent shame of being average at something is stopping us from engaging with anything — when really we all know that doing a little bit of something that we find fun is better than avoiding it entirely for fear of not being able to achieve anything of significance. Stepping out every so often to take part in something is a win in itself and it’s time we were all reminded of it. </p>



<p>My next venture for the new year? Roller skating. Here’s hoping for more laughs than broken bones.</p>

<p>One of my favorite things about this job is getting to hunt for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-nail-manicure-trends-2025"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">manicure inspiration</a> and call it work. In the past few weeks, I’ve spotted (and promptly booked) <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/polka-dot-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">cat-eye polka-dot nails</a>, not to mention <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/argyle-sweater-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">argyle sweater nails</a>, and even <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nail-manicure-trends-2026"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">deer-print nails</a> — a cute winter alternative to tortoiseshell. But as I’ve been tracking the coolest trends, one color combination keeps coming up. Enter: blue and brown. Actually, I’m calling it blue suede. </p>



<p>I know what you’re thinking: it’s not the most obvious color pairing, and on paper, it shouldn’t work. But judging by Instagram’s nail artists, the duo is surprisingly dynamic, and it’s quickly becoming one of their most requested designs. </p>

<p>In the same way that the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/argyle-sweater-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">argyle pattern</a> has transcended fashion and made its way onto our nails, Griffiths thinks that our obsession with these shades comes from a small tweak we’re making to our closets: “I think recently a lot of people have been replacing black with chocolate brown as a softer wardrobe staple,” she says, adding, “Brown and blue as a nail combo will be trending as it’s a fun way to wear color, but it still somehow feels like you’re wearing neutrals as they match so easily to the clothes that most of us already have in our wardrobes.” It’s further proof that blue denim really does go with everything. </p>

<p>If you want to switch things up, some manicurists are replacing brown tones with rich burgundy, and while seeming like an unusual match, the various creations posted to Instagram prove otherwise.

<p>Plaid print nails aren’t going anywhere, but the 2026 upgrade is keeping things monochrome. Nail artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DQD8X2UE2Zc/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">kiri. wnia</a> has taken inspiration from Pantone’s Chicory Coffee (a smoky brown) and Blue Bell (a powdery pastel blue) and delicately layered them to create this blue and brown set that appears almost jelly-like.  </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11615068.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>I’ve never been the sort of person who <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-journals"">keeps a diary</a>. There was that fluffy padlocked notebook in my tweens, but I only ever occasionally remembered its existence. If I could find it now in the ruins and cardboard boxes of my childhood, it would likely be 85% blank pages, 10% doodles, and 5% “spy notes” about my family (nothing quite like scribbling down all of your loved ones’ movements, eh?).</p>



<p>Still, like countless others, I’ve spent a lot<em> </em>of time watching influencers’ morning and evening routines on social media. A <em>lot</em> of time. And, yes, I’ve noticed that almost all of them include <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ordinary-habit-for-now-wellness-journal-review"">a journaling session</a> or two. It makes a lot of sense: Studies have repeatedly shown that engaging in <a href=""https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentID=4552&amp;ContentTypeID=1"">regular journaling can help reduce stress</a>, manage anxiety and depression symptoms, enhance self-awareness, promote emotional regulation, provide opportunities for positive self-talk, and even strengthen resilience in the face of challenges. If you can stick to it. </p>



<p>Intrigued by all of the above, and keen to see if it could help me get a better handle on my own stresses and worries, I decided to give it a go for myself — but not before consulting with the experts. And, as you’ve likely guessed already, it turns out my snarky tween diary <em>definitely</em> wouldn’t cut it when it comes to reaping the myriad psychological benefits of this popular pastime. </p>



<p>“Journaling is essentially another way of saying ‘putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper,’ giving them a place to exist outside of our heads,” explains mental health advocate, author of <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Therapy-Magic-essential-life-changing-experiences-ebook/dp/B08YD5JLWL""><em>Therapy Is…Magic</em></a>, and trainee psychotherapist <a href=""https://www.jolove.co.uk/"">Jo Love</a>, describing it as a “tool that allows us to process our emotions and creates an opportunity for self-reflection.”</p>



<p>“Its effectiveness varies based on individual preferences and psychological needs,” adds author, psychologist and certified therapist, <a href=""https://www.kalanitbenari.com/about"">Kalanit Ben-Ari</a>, <a href=""https://www.kalanitbenari.com/about"">PhD</a>. “Reflective journaling is particularly beneficial for emotional release, processing feelings and thoughts, and reducing anxiety. It enhances self-awareness; as one writes, reads, and perhaps edits or adds to their entries, they create a psychological space between themselves and their thoughts and feelings. This process allows for framing experiences and opens the door for processing and reframing.”</p>



<p>Reassuring me that there are no set rules for how to journal “properly,” Love notes that “there are thousands of helpful ideas and prompts out there if you find yourself staring fruitlessly at a blank page.” </p>



<p>“The main thing is to ditch the guilt about achieving perfection,” she adds. “Even if all you do is write a single line, then that is totally OK.”</p>



<p>“Personal preference absolutely plays a role,” agrees Dr. Ben-Ari. “Some find it beneficial to write in the morning to set intentions and establish a positive mindset for the day, while others prefer journaling before bed, which helps in reflecting on the day and calming the mind for a good night’s sleep.”</p>



<p>With their advice in mind, I dug an unused notebook out from the back of a drawer, scoured the house for a pen (a fruitless task: I wound up buying a pack of biros at the corner shop), and positioned them artfully beside my bed.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Even if all you do is write a single line, then that is totally OK.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Reader, I won’t lie to you: I found it incredibly difficult to think of anything to write for the first few nights and mornings. The words of my university’s creative writing tutor rang in my ears, however — <em>just start writing, and the words will come </em>— and so that’s what I did. I wrote banal little sentences about my day: about what I’d eaten for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. About how delayed the trains had been. About the <em>weather</em> (how incredibly, painfully British of me). Unsurprisingly, I began to view the journaling as a chore to be ticked off, rather than as valuable time for myself. </p>



<p>This is normal: as humans, we are notoriously bad at <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/01/8903068/how-to-change-habits"">forging new habits</a>. In fact, research shows that 23% of people <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/why-new-years-resolutions-fail"">quit their resolutions</a> by the end of the first week, and <a href=""https://insideoutmastery.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/"">43% quit by the end of January</a>. “Like resolutions, you might start journaling with great intentions and goodwill, but find they often fade within a few weeks,” says Dr. Ben-Ari. “People might find it hard to stick to a journaling schedule, as it doesn’t offer the same benefits for everyone’s mental and emotional health.”</p>



<p>Thankfully, both of my experts had some tips on how to get more out of my tentative journaling experiment — in the hope that I might be able to keep the good habit in place for longer.</p>



<p>“Treat your journal as a private exploration space just for you and no one else,” suggests Love. “Take some time to reflect on your day, important events in your life, or decisions you’ve made. You might want to jot down anything you’re worried or bothered about. It can be helpful, too, to think about what has made you feel good or proud of yourself. And a letter to your past or future self can be a truly powerful experience.”</p>



<p>Dr. Ben-Ari, meanwhile, had another suggestion with regards to what to write. “In my clinic, I encourage clients to keep a dream journal, as dreams, which are easily forgotten, carry messages from our inner wisdom and unconscious,” she told me. “Writing them down serves three functions: remembering the dreams; learning about the dreams narratives and themes; and noticing the psychological shifts they reflect in therapy.”</p>



<p>I began taking a cup of chamomile tea up with me to bed and sipping it as I noted down all of my thoughts and feelings in a bid to make my head — and world — feel that little bit clearer. I’m the sort of socially anxious person who worries over every perceived slight, so I used my journal to explore these fears rather than lying awake obsessing over them. And, as someone whose inner critic is her biggest bully, it was genuinely lovely to take a moment each night to pay attention to the things I’d done well — no matter how small. </p>



<p>As time ticked on, I found myself looking forward to curling up in bed with my journal. And, as someone who usually spends a great deal of time tossing and turning and fretting before eventually plunging headfirst into a series of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/04/9659134/having-vivid-dreams-coronavirus"">anxiety-fueled dreams</a> (dreams which I’m now making a point of committing to paper, I hasten to add), I’m happy to report that I found myself falling asleep more quickly after journaling, too. The dreams have proven as erratic as ever, mind you, but I’m hoping that keeping this habit up will help to improve them over time. <br /><br />If I’m being completely honest, my inner cynic wanted this experiment to prove a failure. I’ve never been fond of elaborate morning and evening routines — especially when they reek of “wellbeing washing” — and all of the “click to buy” links on people’s social media made me assume it was nothing but a cash grab. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>As time ticked on, I found myself looking forward to curling up in bed with my journal. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>I also found that buying myself an extra-special sparkly notebook added a sense of occasion to proceedings, but anything will do the job in a pinch. All you really need is a few minutes each day: Yes, many people aim to write for 15 or 20 minutes, but starting small is honestly the best way to set a habit in motion (and, if you’re anything like me, you’ll find that you wind up writing more and more as the weeks tick by).</p>



<p>If you need some help getting started, Love suggests that you try something like “a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gratitude-journal-prompt-ideas"">‘gratitude journal’</a> and jot down three things you’re grateful for, or a ‘one sentence a day’ approach to help take the pressure off, particularly for those who find writing hard or are out of practice. “Writing about whatever events, thoughts or feelings that came up that day can be another simple entry point to journaling,” she adds.</p>



<p>Just one word of caution: While this activity has proven incredibly beneficial to many people, and while I myself have been won over, it’s important to pay attention to how the activity makes <em>you </em>feel. Everyone is different.</p>



<p>“Reflective journaling, when feeling overwhelmed, offers a space to make sense of experiences and feelings, helping to calm the mind,” says Dr. Ben-Ari. “However, I generally don’t recommend journaling ‘to-do lists’ as they can add stress or distract from deeper issues that need attention. Also, writing that dwells excessively on negative events or feelings, a process known as over-rumination, can lead to increased stress. Concerns about privacy can also impact the honesty needed for reflective journaling.”</p>



<p>Adding that “it’s also important to note that not everyone enjoys writing,” Ben-Ari notes that its benefits can still be reaped “through art, drawing or other creative means as a way to process feelings.” We just need to remember that it is a tool, and use it in a way that works best for us as individuals.</p>



<p>On that note, I’m off to bed — and, yes, you’d best believe I’ll be journaling about the experience of writing about journaling. Things are about to get incredibly meta…</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2021/09/10675277/coolest-tv-characters"">Sophie Turner</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/saltburn-emerald-fennell-interview"">Archie Madekwe’s</a> newest <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/amazon-prime-video"">Prime Video</a> show <em>Steal</em> centers around a major heist where billions of pounds are stolen from a London pension fund. Without giving any spoilers (there’s a <em>lot</em> of twists revealed throughout the show), the series broadly focuses on how much wealth in society is controlled by a small percentage of people, how it affects all of us workers in the capitalist regime, and what lengths people will go to for money.</p>



<p>Turner plays Zara, your regular office worker who barely earns a living wage while working at a swanky office in London’s wealthy financial district. The show depicts the fallout after thieves hold the office workers hostage and steal billions of pounds from people’s pensions. As Zara and her friend Luke (Madekwe) try to solve the mystery, things get complicated, and lives are at stake.</p>



<p>Madekwe tells <em>Refinery29</em> it’s “very dangerous” to have so much wealth controlled by so few people, which he believes <em>Steal </em>conveys well. “It’s incredibly prevalent right now… I think the show kind of explores that in a lot of ways, but of course, it’s awful,” the actor says. “I think people can relate to [the show]. I think everybody is feeling [stuck], you know? And everybody feels helpless, and there are people [who] could change the situation, and don’t… the disparity [in wealth] is huge, and it isn’t fair. And yeah, it’s anarchic.”</p>



<p>Turner adds that <em>Steal </em>shows how desperation, when it comes to money, can push people to the limit. “We’ve got too many billionaires and the cost-of-living crisis [means] the disparity is too big, and the gap’s got to close. I wish I could do something about it, but I just can’t,” she says. “But that’s what I like about the show, as well. It explores why good people do bad things, and it is for reasons like this. So that’s what I love, exploring that.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>We’ve got too many billionaires and the cost-of-living crisis [means] the disparity is too big, and the gap’s got to close.</p><cite>Sophie Turner</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>For Turner, she’s previously played fantasy characters like Sansa Stark (<em>Game of Thrones)</em>, Jean Grey (<em>X-Men: Apocalpyse</em>) and more recently, 1980s character Joan (<em>Joan</em>). It’s no surprise that for a show tackling topics like wealth inequality, her role as Zara in <em>Steal</em> hits closer to home, with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/emma-mackey-jamie-lee-curtis-ella-mccay-trauma"">family trauma</a>, a messy love life, and other relatable traits. But rather than missing an extravagant wardrobe or hours in makeup, she relished the chance to tell a story in a different way. “I don’t think I’ve ever played a character quite as messy as her and it was really fun because I felt like I could just show up.. it’s just very relieving when you don’t have to wear a corset and your shoulders aren’t pulled back, you don’t have to talk in a certain way,” Turner says. “I could just kind of flop about, I don’t know how else to explain it. I felt so free in playing her, I think that’s what I mean,” she adds. “[She’s the] closest to me as any character I’ve played.”</p>



<p>While her character Zara is more ordinary than most others she’s stepped into, being held at gunpoint is anything but. While you’d imagine being put through your paces by masked thieves would be taxing, Turner actually just saw that action-packed day as another day in the office… literally. “I really thrive on days when it is a high-stakes day where it’s a lot of drama and a lot of emotion, and I actually find it quite cathartic,” the actor says. “I go home feeling much better about myself than I did walking in. I think that’s what acting is for me, is therapy. I always feel better going home and it’s easy to step out of it.”</p>



<p>And even though the actors might not take home the anxiety or emotions from set, <em>Steal’s</em> fast-paced show could very well induce it in viewers. But Madekwe notes that’s the reason viewers watch heist shows in the first place. “It’s like fun, escapism,” he explains. “I always love [watching] things that make me kind of physically feel something. And if something gets your heart racing, kind of builds anxiety in that way like a show like this does, and you’re able to create that in your own home, then I think it’s so exciting. And this show, I think, really succeeds with that.”</p>



<p><em><strong>All six episodes of Steal will be able to stream on Amazon Prime Video on January 21, 2026.</strong></em><br /></p>
