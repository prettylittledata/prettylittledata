<p>Since the military coup of February 2021, Housing NOW has developed a modular bamboo housing system engineered for emergency and conflict-affected contexts in Myanmar. The country has hundreds of bamboo species in all shapes, colors, and forms. Conventionally, the largest-diameter species are used for construction, while smaller culms are employed for farming or fencing. The larger culms go for higher prices on the market; by contrast, small-diameter bamboo is extremely abundant and inexpensive because its traditional applications demand it in large quantities. This affordability presents an architectural opportunity: by bundling and reconfiguring these small culms into structural frames, Housing NOW has repurposed a low-value material into a groundbreaking construction system.</p>",

<h4>What Genie taught us about customer-centric innovation — and how those lessons still shape great products today</h4><figure><img alt=""Two early mobile phones, Nortel Orbitor and Nokia 7110, displayed on either side of a white Genie Internet mug, symbolising the pioneering era of mobile internet innovation in the late 1990s."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JTf1Dgh1CU79G8F3Bm4-ow.png"" /><figcaption>The tools of a mobile revolution — early handsets and the original Genie Internet brand that helped shape the first era of mobile experiences.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Long before apps and app stores, this is how a small team out-paced global giants to design one of the world’s first mobile internet portals — and shape the future of connected experiences.</em></p><p>In the late 1990s, the global giants of tech and telco bet billions on mobile internet architecture. We anchored ourselves to a single principle: that the future of the internet would be <em>personal, mobile, and woven into every moment</em>. This is the story of how our small team, Genie, out-paced those giants with $100 million less — by starting with the experience, not the platform. And crucially, we weren’t just thinking differently — we were moving faster.</p><p>Even more remarkable, Genie’s first public alpha launched as early as 1997, more than three years before Vodafone and Vivendi unveiled Vizzavi in June 2000. When it came to WAP — the technology that made mobile web experiences possible — Genie’s services went live in January 2000, a full six months before Vodafone entered the market. By the point Vizzavi was preparing for launch, Genie already had 900,000 registered users. While much of the industry was still debating what “mobile internet” meant, BT Cellnet had already shipped a working prototype — so innovative that <em>The Guardian</em> noted that “BT Cellnet has been an innovator and launched the mobile [WAP] version of its Genie web portal in January.” That early advantage — measured in years, not months — shaped how we approached every decision that followed.</p><p>This core conviction led to the creation of Genie, one of the UK’s first mobile internet portals. It also set us directly against the largest corporate forces in Europe. While incumbent telco giants spent hundreds of millions trying to force massive, integrated platforms onto the market — such as the Vodafone/Vivendi Vizzavi joint venture — our small team had to achieve more with roughly 1/20th of the capital.</p><p>This case study compares those two radically different innovation strategies: the Architecture-first approach of the incumbent and our Experience-first approach. It is a story about how sequencing — starting with the customer experience and working backwards to the technology — transformed an idea into market impact, and why those same lessons still define the gap between product failure and breakthrough success today.</p><h3>When the internet learned to move</h3><p>Having worked on some of the world’s earliest smartphone prototypes at BT Cellnet — including Nortel’s pioneering Orbitor/Europa concept — I went on to co-found Genie, the UK’s first mobile internet portal and one of the first anywhere in the world. I served as head of music, games and entertainment, receiving a BT Recognition Award as a co-founder.</p><p>This is the story of what we built, how we did it, and what it taught us about designing products and services that people genuinely want. It’s also a reflection on the choices that made the difference—the strategic calls, cultural decisions and customer-centred design principles that transformed ideas into impact.</p><p>Most importantly, it’s a story about <em>how strategy really works</em> when technology, experience and organisational change collide, and why those same lessons still matter for startups and product teams today.</p><h3>The set-up: two very different bets on the “mobile internet”</h3><p>This case study compares two radically different approaches to innovation during the first mobile-internet wave — Genie<strong> </strong>(BT Cellnet/BT) and Vizzavi (Vodafone + Vivendi) — and distils what those choices mean for two audiences:</p><ol><li>Early-stage startups searching for product-market fit.</li><li>Large organisations trying to think and ship like startups.</li></ol><p>My aim is to show, with evidence, how decisions around strategy, business-model innovation and value-proposition design can either accelerate ideas into reality, or quietly stop them from ever getting there. This is because in my role today mentoring startups, I still see the same patterns we lived through repeating themselves today.</p><h3>Personal context (1996–1997)</h3><p>I joined BT Cellnet in 1996 as Business Development Manager for smartphones, coming from a user-centred design and customer-experience background inside BT. Even before the word “smartphone” existed, we were already proving how mobile devices could deliver real services, not just calls and texts.</p><figure><img alt=""A BT Cellnet Alcatel mobile phone from the mid-1990s featuring a dedicated “B” button for checking Barclaycard balances, an early example of integrated mobile services before smartphones."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/718/1*6mXcu9NM7BbE6XUG_LVn2A.png"" /><figcaption>A BT Cellnet handset launched in partnership with Barclaycard in the mid-1990s, offering customers 20 % off calls and a dedicated “B” button to check credit card balances — a pioneering example of mobile services before the smartphone era.</figcaption></figure><p>One of the most significant projects I worked on was a collaboration with Alcatel and Barclaycard on a handset that offered customers 20 % off their call costs and included a dedicated “B” button to check credit card balances, all powered by over-the-air menu updates (SOAP). The strength of the idea lay in its simplicity, and usability was intentionally built in from the beginning. My role was to help shape the vision into something tangible: defining the user experience, scoping how the service would work, and building the partnerships needed to bring it to life. That experience deeply shaped my thinking when we went on to build Genie, showing how a clear value proposition and seamless experience could change customer behaviour at scale.</p><p>By 1997 we were already building client–server mobile services. BT Cellnet was among the most innovative operators in Europe at the time, and handset manufacturers selected us as their development-partner network, giving our small team hands-on experience with device–service integration long before it was mainstream.</p><p>Even at this early stage, we were exploring bold visions of what a connected, mobile future might look like. As Business Development Manager for smartphones, my role was to identify these emerging opportunities and translate them into real partnerships, prototypes and product concepts.</p><figure><img alt=""A 1995 Nortel concept illustration showing a person holding an early smartphone prototype with a headset device, representing one of the first visions of mobile internet interaction."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*geKCuQShABLh75VFRjlD_w.jpeg"" /><figcaption>A Nortel concept image from 1995 imagining the future of mobile communication — an early vision of the smartphone era that inspired the Orbitor/Europa prototype and informed Genie’s design approac</figcaption></figure><p>That background gave us an edge over Vodafone. We treated design as strategy, embedding user experience, service design and customer insight into product and partnership choices, rather than relying on traditional corporate levers like mergers, acquisitions or joint ventures. This was design thinking in its original sense: putting the customer and the end-to-end experience <em>inside</em> strategy, not simply layering it on top.</p><p>(For context, 1997 was also the year Steve Jobs famously contrasted Java’s “cross-platform” vision with Apple’s integrated approach — a debate that shaped how we thought about platforms and apps.)</p><h3>Experience-first vs. architecture-first</h3><p>Jobs also argued that you must “start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology.” That principle became our north star. We began with the end-to-end experience and the value proposition we wanted to deliver, then built the enabling stack and partnerships around it.</p><p>By contrast, Vodafone and Vivendi started with <strong>a </strong>joint-venture architecture, trying to reconcile brands, organisations, technology and content <em>before</em> they had a clear, validated customer experience. That difference in sequencing shaped everything that followed.</p><p>The contrast in sequencing also reflected a profound difference in risk appetite. Genie’s approach embraced the calculated risk of rapid iteration and low-cost failure — shipping simple services quickly and learning from real user behavior within the constraints of the technology. By contrast, Vizzavi chose the traditional corporate risk: massive capital outlay and structural integration <em>before</em> validating a clear customer value proposition. This structural difference determined not only their speed but their ultimate financial viability.</p><p>Genie’s playbook emphasised shipping services that people could actually use on 2G/WAP; making them network-agnostic to maximise audience; pricing them to encourage exploration rather than meter usage; and iterating fast with content partners. The public record shows key Genie milestones: the UK’s first free-access mobile ISP, the first commercial pre-pay WAP service, and later the UK’s first unmetered 24/7 mobile internet service for £20/month.</p><p>Vizzavi’s playbook, meanwhile, focused on building one pan-European portal and brand, backed by heavy investment and exclusive content. The joint venture ultimately cost hundreds of millions, struggled operationally (including a botched email-platform upgrade), and was folded into Vodafone live! by late 2002, having spent £500 million building the brand.</p><p>The outcomes highlight the failure of the architecture-first approach. Vizzavi focused on consolidating assets and capital, but the platform was never truly designed around solving a fundamental customer job-to-be-done. In contrast, Genie’s success proved that agile execution and genuine customer value beat billions in misaligned capital — a lesson that remains universally true for any startup facing large incumbents.</p><h3>What a mobile internet portal was (and where WAP fits)</h3><p>In the late 1990s, a “portal” meant a curated front door to online services. AOL and CompuServe served as dial-up destinations on PCs — but there was no equivalent on mobile. Genie was created to fill that gap, set up as an Internet Service Provider, a web portal and a suite of mobile information services, initially delivered via SMS to build habitual use before WAP was ready. On handsets, we were starting from scratch: tiny screens, 2G bandwidth, high latency, limited memory and a brand-new software stack.</p><figure><img alt=""Vintage BT Cellnet Pay &amp; Go phone bundle with Genie software CD — an early example of how mobile internet services were distributed before app stores existed."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/730/1*kNvmRpzy-fLK5jXJQOtdNg.png"" /><figcaption>In the pre-app era, Genie distributed its mobile internet software via CDs and bundled services directly with BT Cellnet handsets — transforming phones into a channel for innovation.</figcaption></figure><p>Distribution was equally experimental. Before app stores existed, we shipped our software on physical CDs and partnered with BT Cellnet to bundle services directly through pre-pay phones. Handsets weren’t just devices; they became a channel to market — a way to deliver the mobile internet experience directly into users’ hands.</p><p>Long before software updates were a tap away, distribution was part of the design challenge. By bundling our services with physical devices and using CDs as delivery mechanisms, we weren’t just marketing a product , we were shaping the entire user journey from the moment someone unboxed their phone. It taught us that when the platform doesn’t yet exist, you have to build the ecosystem around it yourself. Designing not just the product, but the pathway it travels is a mindset that still applies today in emerging technologies, from spatial computing to AI-driven services.</p><h4>WAP’s role</h4><p>As part of BT’s delegation, I was a member of the WAP Forum, where we helped define the early standards that made mobile web experiences possible on constrained devices. WAP provided a shared way to render simple pages and trigger actions (like messaging and look-ups) on phones — a pragmatic bridge between the open web and the real-world limitations of mobile hardware.</p><h4>Genie alpha: from web-to-SMS to information services</h4><p>Our first public experiment was a simple Genie alpha site that allowed anyone to register for free and send an SMS from a web page to a mobile device. It was the first such service in the UK, and arguably the first commercial, public web-to-SMS service globally, launched in beta in 1998, before the official Genie Internet launch in March 1999.</p><p>As BBC coverage at the time noted, Genie already had thousands of text-message users before the official launch. Initially, it operated as a BT Cellnet web portal and value-added service. We then layered on basic information services — football scores, weather updates, news headlines — because they aligned with people’s daily habits.</p><h4>Device partnerships shaped the portal</h4><p>The client–server work we had begun with Nortel, Nokia, Motorola and Ericsson fed directly into our service ideas. We weren’t simply publishing WAP pages; we were designing interactions that devices could realistically deliver and aligning with manufacturers’ roadmaps wherever possible.</p><h3>Speed to market mattered</h3><p>Genie launched in beta in 1998, with the official launch in March 1999 — well ahead of Vodafone and Vivendi’s Vizzavi, which wasn’t announced until May 2000. Shipping something simple rather than waiting for perfect gave us a head-start and helped us build an early-adopter base. As the audience grew, major content brands (MTV, EMI, Dotmusic, Ministry of Sound) and gaming partners approached us to develop their first mobile services.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/1c7568ab2485ac932e3afd9b70c41358/href"">https://medium.com/media/1c7568ab2485ac932e3afd9b70c41358/href</a><p>The UK’s first WAP advert, created by BT Cellnet together with Genie, showing how we first introduced the idea of mobile internet to the public in the late 1990s.</p><h3>What we Shipped (and why it mattered)</h3><h4>1. Network-agnostic content (before micropayments)</h4><p>We deliberately made services accessible on any UK network, not just BT Cellnet. That widened our reach and created a powerful acquisition loop: customers who discovered Genie elsewhere often returned to BT Cellnet for better pricing, devices or support. The press at the time explicitly noted that <em>Big Brother</em> mobile services were available across all networks.</p><figure><img alt=""Presentation of Genie’s early mobile internet service for Channel 4 in the late 1990s, with a demonstrator showing how mobile devices could access online content on screen."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ayGXkayw0kkZ3BxX-myooQ.png"" /><figcaption>Demonstration for Channel 4 of Genie’s pioneering mobile internet service in the late 1990s, showing early content services for mobile phones during a product presentation.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>What we learned:</strong> Without mature billing rails inside the portal, attention and habit were the currency. Openness grew usage, and usage reduced churn for the host network.</p><h4>2. Pricing that Unlocked Behavior: The Customer R&amp;D Model</h4><p>In November 2000, Genie launched the UK’s first unmetered mobile internet plan at £20 per month — a bold move designed to drive mass adoption and exploration.</p><p>This pricing decision was, in effect, a subsidy for customer research and development. At the time, mobile internet was universally billed on a terrifying per-minute or per-kilobyte basis, which paralyzed users with “fear of the bill” and prevented experimentation. The metered approach actively killed the very behavior we needed to discover.</p><p><strong>What we learned</strong>: People cannot discover what a new medium is <em>for</em> under a metered plan. The flat-rate, “all-you-can-eat” model was a strategic call to remove that financial barrier, letting users experiment, fail, and develop sticky habitswithout punishment. For product builders today, the lesson is simple: your monetization model must encourage the desired user behavior, not restrict it.</p><h4>3. G Live Music — Reimagining How Fans and Artists Connect</h4><p>By the late 1990s, the music industry was waking up to the fact that the internet would radically change how artists reached their audiences, and that mobile could become the most important channel of all. Major labels were already experimenting: Danny van Emden returned to Virgin Records to establish the UK’s first New Media department, ensuring that every artist had an online presence and launching <em>The Raft</em>, one of the earliest label websites. EMI, Virgin’s parent company, quickly followed suit, with Fergal Gara and Eric Winbolt leading a dedicated new media team.</p><p>What they understood, and what many others missed, was that the next generation of fans might never experience the web primarily through a computer. Mobile, not desktop, was going to be the dominant way they discovered, consumed, and interacted with music. That made Genie a natural partner.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/a6c0323b4c475f694d22d7da6c8f06a8/href"">https://medium.com/media/a6c0323b4c475f694d22d7da6c8f06a8/href</a><p><em>At the top of the BT Tower, G Live Music launched with artists like Atomic Kitten on hand — marking a breakthrough moment when record labels, artists and Genie teamed up to connect directly with fans through their phones, long before the era of Twitter and streaming.</em></p><p>BT Retail had already been exploring voice-based services, while Genie was leading the market for SMS. The breakthrough idea was to combine the two into a hybrid experience, G Live Music<strong>, </strong>where EMI could send text alerts to fans that included not only headlines and updates, but also a phone number they could call to hear more.</p><p>To make the service engaging, I designed four distinct channels — <em>Stars</em>, <em>Guitars</em>, <em>Heartbeats</em> and <em>Breakbeats</em> — covering rock, indie, pop and dance music. Virgin hired BBC Radio 1’s Jo Wiley as the voice of the service, and record labels including Virgin, EMI, Chrysalis and Parlophone arranged for the artists themselves to record exclusive personal messages. This was more than a content feed . It was a direct line from band to fan, offering the kind of personalised access that would only become mainstream a decade later with platforms like Twitter.</p><p>G Live Music launched with major publicity at the top of the BT Tower, signalling a new direction for how artists and audiences could connect. It was an early example of how mobile services could go beyond delivering information — they could build <em>relationships</em>, turning devices into channels for authentic, human connection.</p><p><strong>What we learned:</strong> Personalisation and proximity are powerful drivers of engagement. When artists’ voices reached fans directly — literally in their pockets — the emotional connection was far stronger than any banner ad or website visit. The project showed that successful mobile experiences are not just about content delivery, but about creating <em>intimacy</em> and <em>community</em> at scale.</p><h4>4. Interactive Formats at Scale — From Big Brother to a Global Games Platform</h4><p>One of the most powerful proofs of Genie’s approach came through our work on interactive entertainment, not just as content, but as a new category of mobile experience.</p><p>The <em>Big Brother: Lifestylers</em> project is often remembered as one of the first large-scale interactive mobile games in Europe, giving users the chance to shape virtual characters and influence outcomes on their phones. But the real story wasn’t the gameplay itself. It was the platform behind it.</p><p>When BT decided not to build a dedicated gaming platform in-house, the consultant I had been working with, Kevin Bradshaw, founded a startup to take the idea forward. That company — Digital Bridges — would go on to become one of the world’s top three mobile multiplayer gaming platforms, powering many of the early titles that defined the mobile games industry in the early 2000s.</p><p>By integrating the Digital Bridges platform into Genie, we were able to scale quickly and support a new wave of interactive formats. <em>Big Brother: Lifestylers</em> alone generated around 2.5 million play-minutes from roughly 60,000 players in just five weeks — a clear sign that people were willing to invest time and attention in mobile experiences when they were designed for the medium. And crucially, the service was available on all UK networks, reflecting Genie’s belief that reach and behaviour-building were more valuable than short-term exclusivity.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Genie’s Big Brother: Lifestylers WAP game, an early mobile entertainment service built on the Digital Bridges platform."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8vZeuZSCUL31swang_pJig.png"" /></figure><p><em>The Big Brother: Lifestylers WAP game, launched by Genie in partnership with Picofun and Channel 4, showcased the potential of interactive entertainment on mobile and helped accelerate the rise of Digital Bridges, which became one of the world’s leading multiplayer gaming platforms.</em></p><p>This phase of Genie’s evolution wasn’t just about a single hit. It was about building the infrastructure and partnerships that made new kinds of engagement possible. The success of Digital Bridges proved that mobile could support complex, multi-player, interactive formats long before app stores existed, and that those experiences could play a central role in shaping customer habits and expectations.</p><h4>5. Device-level ambition (and why we pulled back): Nortel “Orbitor”</h4><p>We explored integrating Genie-style services into Nortel’s Orbitor — a touchscreen, voice-recognition smartphone concept (1998).</p><figure><img alt=""Close-up of an early Nortel Orbitor smartphone prototype showing a stylus-based interface and contact list, illustrating one of the first Java-powered attempts to combine voice, messaging, touchscreen and internet services on a single mobile device."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oxT6hwXA94-W7B7Efkh6Sw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>An early prototype of the Nortel “Orbitor” smartphone concept from the late 1990s — a bold attempt to integrate voice, touchscreen and internet services using Java, years before such functionality became standard.</figcaption></figure><p>The idea was right, but the technology was too early. Public museum records document both the ambition and the limitations of the device.</p><p>Working on Orbitor reinforced a lesson that would guide us throughout Genie’s development: visionary ideas are only as powerful as the technology that enables them. The device itself was remarkable — it combined voice, messaging, touchscreen navigation and over-the-air services, all running on Java long before that was standard in mobile environments. Even though the hardware and networks weren’t yet ready to support such ambitions at scale, the experience we were aiming for became a north star — shaping how we approached service design, interfaces and the broader future of mobile interaction.</p><p><strong>What we learned:</strong> Vision needs timing. A decade later, iPhone-class hardware and OSs finally caught up with the idea.</p><h4>6. GenieMobile — Extending the Portal Beyond the Phone</h4><p>Genie Internet was also one of the earliest examples of what we would now call a virtual mobile operator. It operated entirely digitally, with no physical retail presence, building its brand, acquiring customers and delivering services exclusively online. That approach, radical for its time, allowed us to move quickly, experiment with new propositions and scale without the overhead of traditional mobile infrastructure.</p><p>While Genie was conceived as a mobile-first service, we knew from the start that the experience couldn’t end at the handset. Most users were still accessing the web from desktop computers, and they needed a simple way to manage their accounts, discover services and prepare content before going mobile. That insight led to GenieMobile, a companion desktop application designed to extend the value of the portal far beyond the small screen.</p><figure><img alt=""Promotional advert for GenieMobile showing a free Nokia 3330 mobile internet phone offer from BT Cellnet’s Genie service."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/120/1*RrzXCvEKqksTMk64sufb6Q.gif"" /><figcaption>Promotional campaign for GenieMobile offering a free Nokia 3330 internet-ready handset to new users.</figcaption></figure><p>GenieMobile allowed users to manage and personalise their mobile internet experience before they even picked up their phone. Among its most popular features were:</p><ul><li>SMS alerts, delivering breaking information directly to a user’s handset as it happened.</li><li>Email on WAP, providing free access to services like BT Internet, Talk21, Freeserve and Genie email accounts from anywhere in the UK.</li><li>A personalised WAP menu, letting users select favourites on the Genie website and have them appear automatically on their phone for easier navigation.</li><li>GenieOne, a unified inbox that brought together emails, faxes and voice messages in one place, accessible from either a PC or a mobile device.</li></ul><p>At a time when over-the-air delivery was expensive and limited, GenieMobile acted as a seamless bridge between desktop and handset. It was one of the earliest attempts to synchronise services and preferences across devices, paving the way for the companion app model that would later become standard in the smartphone era.</p><p>GenieMobile’s web-to-handset portal liberated users from the nightmare of GenieMobile’s web-to-handset portal freed users from the hassle of configuring finicky ISP settings on clunky Nokia or Ericsson phones, enabling seamless SMS forwarding and address book management from any browser — a proto-cloud lifeline for professionals juggling work PCs and early mobiles. By cutting setup friction, it doubled daily engagement for power users, cementing loyalty and outpacing rivals stuck in mobile-only complexity. This experience-first innovation, despite primitive network limits, laid groundwork for the cloud era before 3G arrived</p><p><strong>What we learned</strong>: A great mobile experience doesn’t start on the phone — it starts wherever the user is. GenieMobile showed that extending the journey across devices could deepen engagement and reduce friction, years before companion apps became the norm.</p><h3>Building for a 3G Future — and Inventing the Cloud Before It Had a Name</h3><p>That shift in perception created the foundation for what came next — a move beyond 2G services toward a future shaped by 3G networks, cloud storage, and entirely new kinds of mobile experiences.</p><p>While much of Genie’s early innovation focused on creating compelling services within the limits of 2G — like short-form entertainment, mobile radio, and interactive formats — we were already thinking well beyond those constraints. Inside the team, our discussions and prototypes increasingly centred on what would be possible once 3G networks, Java-enabled devices, and always-on connectivity became the norm.</p><p>The ambition was bold: to create a fully integrated content ecosystem that could support music, games, messaging, ringtones, and even personal media — all underpinned by payment infrastructure, digital rights management (DRM), and a personal digital locker. We wanted people to be able to download content directly to their devices, store it in the cloud (though we didn’t yet use that word), and access it seamlessly across multiple touchpoints: phones, PDAs, and even desktop browsers.</p><p>Central to this vision was the idea of openness and interoperability. The platform would expose APIs that allowed third-party developers and content providers — including early partners like Digital Bridges, mp3.com, Vitaminic and Club Nokia — to plug their services directly into Genie’s ecosystem. This was a radical idea for its time: instead of a closed, operator-controlled platform, Genie aimed to become a value store — a distribution hub where customers could browse, purchase, and manage all their digital experiences from a single interface.</p><p>The diagram below, taken from one of our internal architecture documents, shows how advanced this thinking already was. It envisioned a system capable of provisioning content, handling payments, and enforcing usage permissions, in other words, a blueprint for the modern app store and cloud service model.</p><figure><img alt=""A flow diagram showing Genie’s proposed content management and payment system for games, music and MP3 downloads, including third-party integrations, an API interface, and early plans for cloud-style storage and delivery."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/950/1*EHSHtVEvq0N8bwWV1-r-1w.png"" /><figcaption><em>An internal Genie architecture diagram from the early 2000s outlining one of the first end-to-end visions for cloud-based content delivery — integrating payments, digital rights management, and third-party media into a unified mobile experience.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Even with the concept fully mapped out, one major challenge stood in the way: rights management and legal complexity. Delivering music, games and other premium content required navigating a labyrinth of contracts, distribution deals and licensing agreements. For a startup-scale venture inside BT — even one as ambitious as Genie — that proved difficult to resolve.</p><p>It’s telling that Vodafone, despite its scale and its deep partnership with Vivendi, ran into similar roadblocks. The ecosystem was simply too fragmented, and the legal and commercial incentives too misaligned, for anyone to solve the problem within the constraints of early-2000s mobile infrastructure. In the end, it took Apple’s vertically integrated approach — hardware, software, content, payments and rights all controlled under one roof — and the launch of the iPhone in 2007 to finally make the seamless mobile content model viable.</p><p>But even if we couldn’t deliver it at scale, the vision itself was prophetic. Genie’s platform work was one of the earliest serious attempts to combine content distribution, DRM, payment, storage, and developer integration into a single, customer-centric service. Seen with hindsight, it was a glimpse of the future, one that would eventually define the smartphone era.</p><h3>Taking WAP to the Mainstream — and Telling a New Story</h3><p>For all the innovation we were doing inside Genie, none of it would matter if people didn’t actually use it. The late 1990s mobile landscape was still defined by calls and texts, and the idea of browsing the internet on a phone was, for most people, more science fiction than reality. To succeed, we had to make the concept not only technically possible but emotionally compelling — and that meant changing the story around what a mobile phone <em>was for</em>.</p><p>One of the most significant milestones was the launch of the UK’s first pre-pay WAP phones, developed by Genie in partnership with BT Cellnet. This was the moment when mobile internet shifted from being an expensive, niche add-on to something anyone could access for under £100. The service connected people directly to news, music, sport, and entertainment — and, crucially, to a growing ecosystem of content partners such as EMI, BSkyB, Freeserve and The Guardian.</p><p>The launch was headline news. Sky News covered it as a turning point for mobile technology, highlighting how consumers could now go online without a computer for the first time. As Peter Erskine, Managing Director of BT Cellnet, explained in the report: <em>“Suddenly, instead of buying a thousand-pound computer, people can access the internet just by buying a £99 phone. So suddenly people want the content that they can get.”</em></p><p>I followed by describing how quickly user behaviour would change once richer content became available: <em>“People have a mobile phone and a Sony Walkman. By next year, people will just have their mobile phone and will be listening to their music on their mobile phone. They won’t need two cumbersome devices.”</em></p><p>This shift wasn’t just about hardware, it was about behaviour. Once people experienced the convenience of checking headlines, sending messages, or browsing music on a device they carried everywhere, the mental model of what a phone could do changed forever. And once that shift happened, the demand for more sophisticated services—richer media, better usability, deeper integration — accelerated dramatically.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/a0eedc8be53180bb40916e6239012f7b/href"">https://medium.com/media/a0eedc8be53180bb40916e6239012f7b/href</a><p><em>Sky News report on the launch of the UK’s first pre-pay WAP phones, with commentary from Simon Robinson and BT Cellnet MD Peter Erskine on how mobile content and services were about to change consumer behaviour.</em></p><p>Looking back, this was more than a launch event; it marked a decisive turning point in customer perception. It showed that adoption depends as much on storytelling and value proposition as on technology, a lesson that would shape our thinking throughout Genie’s evolution.</p><h3>How the market likely valued Genie (1999–2001)</h3><p>In the dot-com era, portals and mobile data platforms were valued primarily for their <strong>strategic option value</strong> rather than present-day profits. Genie sat inside BT Cellnet as the face of future data revenue, with millions of registered users and nine-figure monthly WAP page views by mid-2001, and it was already expanding internationally across parts of Europe and Asia.</p><h3>Comparables to anchor the range</h3><ul><li><strong>Vizzavi (Vodafone + Vivendi, 2000–2001):</strong> Launched with an investment plan of ~€1.6 bn, later described as worth £2.5 bn+ at its peak narrative (and higher in some analyst commentary). This shows that credible, pan-European mobile portals attracted billion-scale valuations on strategy alone.</li><li><strong>mmO2 flotation (Nov 2001):</strong> On demerger from BT, mmO2, which absorbed Genie’s assets into O2 Online/O2 Active, opened with a market cap between £6.5 bn and £7.3 bn, depending on the reference price. Genie was not listed separately, but its users, services and brand equity were part of that story.</li></ul><h3>A cautious, internal-style valuation</h3><ul><li><strong>Conservative (“cost-plus + scarcity”):</strong> £0.5 bn–£1.0 bn — reflecting accumulated build and marketing cost for a functioning, growing portal, plus a scarcity premium in a pre-3G market with few credible assets.</li><li><strong>Strategic (“option value vs. Vizzavi”):</strong> £1.0 bn–£2.0 bn — benchmarked against Vizzavi’s billion-euro scale and the idea that Genie could become a primary gateway for messaging, entertainment and games across BT’s European footprint.</li></ul><p>There is no public filing that states “Genie was worth £X.” These figures synthesise comparable valuations, mmO2’s flotation, and Genie’s strategic role within BT Cellnet/BT — a realistic view of how a strategic finance team in 2000–2001 might have valued Genie internally.</p><h3>Results that moved the needles</h3><ul><li><strong>Engagement &amp; growth:</strong> By June 2001 Genie reported ~5.5 million registered users and ~103 million monthly WAP page impressions (BT listing documents).</li><li><strong>Lower churn / higher spend:</strong> In December 1999, BT Cellnet MD Peter Erskine told <em>The Independent</em> that Genie users spent more, were less likely to disconnect, and were expected to grow significantly.</li><li><strong>Industry recognition:</strong> <em>Campaign</em>’s 2001 Marketing Awards (Connections) named Genie <em>Best Use of Mobile Phones/WAP</em>.</li></ul><p>None of this meant we had it all figured out — we didn’t. But the metrics suggested we were pulling the right levers for that era’s constraints.</p><h3>Meanwhile at Vizzavi: brand scale without customer clarity</h3><p>Vizzavi launched as a high-stakes Vodafone–Vivendi joint venture to unify web and mobile portals across Europe, combining Vivendi’s content (music, film, games) with Vodafone’s distribution. The bet: centralise the platform, push a premium brand, and own the customer front door. And their marketing budget was many times higher than Genie’s.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/33c94f6e1c1c808e7f284c972af8b9e3/href"">https://medium.com/media/33c94f6e1c1c808e7f284c972af8b9e3/href</a><p><em>The sales film that was played in Vodafone stores across the UK. Directed and produced by David Goodwin, it featured The Beatles’ Day in the Life with altered lyrics</em></p><p>Here’s how it played out:</p><ul><li><strong>Operational fragility:</strong> A widely reported email outage during a core upgrade in December 2000 eroded user trust.</li><li><strong>Economic misalignment:</strong> Vivendi’s model relied on selling content; Vodafone bundled access, leaning toward “free to users” to drive network adoption — undercutting content margins.</li><li><strong>Strategic endgame:</strong> By August 2002 Vodafone bought out Vivendi’s stake, dropped the Vizzavi brand, and folded services into Vodafone live! (launched October 2002).</li></ul><p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Scale is not a strategy. Without a clear customer job, a mega-portal becomes a cost centre looking for a purpose.</p><h3>Side-by-side: the two playbooks</h3><p>It’s easier to see the underlying patterns when you compare them directly. The table below shows how Genie and Vizzavi diverged across six critical dimensions — and how those choices determined their success or failure.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rfbp3Bm3BKX4_DKclp2dYQ.png"" /></figure><p><em>Figure 1 — A side-by-side comparison of Genie and Vizzavi across six strategic dimensions.</em></p><h3>A brief postscript: the giffgaff echo</h3><p>Years later, giffgaff would demonstrate a similar mindset: community-centred, online-only, and operating with a lean, agile model (launched in 2009 as an MVNO on O2). It was a different era, but the same bias toward simplicity and direct customer connection.</p><h3>Seeing Genie Through the Lens of Customer Centricity</h3><p>To understand why Genie succeeded where others stumbled, it helps to view the story through the structure of the <a href=""https://medium.com/@srerobinson/a-new-framework-to-elevate-customer-centric-strategy-9e8dc8f99627"">Customer Centricity Strategy Framework</a> — a way of thinking developed by Maria Moraes Robinson and I that grew directly out of this work.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram of the Customer Centricity Strategy Framework, showing how organisations can align vision, value propositions, design, and delivery around the customer lifecycle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tmi5KrZpN8G5_8y0naDi-g.jpeg"" /><figcaption>The Customer Centricity Strategy Framework — a model born from Genie’s approach to building products, services and experiences around the customer lifecycle.</figcaption></figure><p>At the time, we didn’t set out to “create a framework.” We were simply trying to build something that mattered to people. But over time, the logic behind those decisions became clear: we were designing intentionally around the <em>customer lifecycle</em> — not treating it as a marketing funnel, but as the central driver of strategy.</p><p>Every choice we made — from the earliest prototypes to our pricing model — was aimed at influencing that lifecycle: attracting users, building habits, deepening engagement, reducing churn and extending lifetime value.</p><h4>1. Scanning future horizons</h4><p>Genie’s origins lay in horizon-scanning. Even before the portal existed, we were exploring prototypes and scenarios for early smartphones, anticipating how connectivity, devices and user expectations would evolve. The goal was not to predict the future but to <em>prepare for it</em>.</p><h4>2. Crafting a clear value proposition</h4><p>Our value proposition was unambiguous: mobile phones were changing. They were no longer just for calls or texts — now, you could <em>surf the BT Cellnet</em>. This wasn’t about listing features; it was about reframing what a mobile phone <em>was</em>and what it <em>could do</em>.</p><h4>3. Leading organisational change</h4><p>Transformation is never purely technical — it’s organisational and cultural too. We faced significant tensionstransitioning from a small team inside BT Cellnet to an independent startup. Our solution was deliberate: wemoved to our own office in Richmond-upon-Thames, a strategic firewall against head-office politics andcorporate bureaucracy. While the Vodafone-Vivendi joint venture slowed under the weight of reconciling brands,budgets, and bureaucracy, Genie operated with the velocity of a startup, maintaining a rapid, agile decision cycle — the essential prerequisite for breakthrough innovation. In today’s tech race, this same agility drives customer-centric wins. For example, it means aligning teams to prioritise user-friendly AI outputs over model complexity — think Grok’s conversational clarity over raw compute.</p><h4>4. Designing strategy across people, processes and partners</h4><p>We didn’t just set product targets — we mapped our strategy holistically across <em>people</em>, <em>processes</em>, <em>marketing</em> and <em>partnerships</em>. We built agile development cycles to release updates rapidly. We forged pioneering partnerships, such as the XY Network, that brought cultural relevance and fresh content. And we designed marketing around behaviours we wanted to encourage — not just around campaigns.</p><h4>5. Putting experience before technology</h4><p>Perhaps the most important principle was sequencing. We started with the experience we wanted to create and worked backwards to the technology required to deliver it. Vizzavi did the reverse — building a platform first and then searching for a purpose. That difference shaped everything: culture, speed, adoption and, ultimately, outcomes.</p><h3>Practical Takeaways for Today’s Builders</h3><p>The story of Genie offers enduring lessons that apply far beyond the mobile industry. These principles, drawn from what we learned two decades ago, are just as relevant whether you’re designing an AI-driven service, launching a SaaS product, or leading change inside a large organisation.</p><ul><li><strong>Mindset Trumps Money: Capital is not Strategy.</strong> Don’t be intimidated by the war chests of large incumbents. Genie achieved superior results with roughly 1/20th of the funding Vizzavi commanded, proving that agility, a superior experience model, and focus on customer habit are far more valuable than a massive, misdirected investment.</li><li><strong>Make it Open by Default.</strong> Openness maximizes your surface area for learning, feedback, and growth — long before a final monetization model is ready. Don’t build walls unless they are essential for your core value proposition.</li><li><strong>Price to Encourage Exploration.</strong> Just as we used flat-rate plans to encourage mobile browsing, your pricing model should act as customer R&amp;D, revealing real jobs-to-be-done rather than punishing early experimentation or metered usage.</li><li><strong>Program the Medium, Not Your Aspirations.</strong> Design services that work <em>with</em> the fundamental constraints of the underlying technology, not against them. In the age of Generative AI, this means recognizing an LLM’s propensity to hallucinate and designing the customer experience to manage verification, rather than forcing the model to act as a perfect, verifiable knowledge base.</li><li><strong>Ship Habits, Not Platforms.</strong> Focus on delivering ten real, sticky user behaviors quickly. This iterative approach creates more cumulative value than waiting years to launch one grand, perfect platform vision.</li><li><strong>Treat Timing as a Feature.</strong> If the enabling technology or market is not ready for the full vision, don’t kill the idea — change the plan. Adapt your scope and scale until technology adoption or infrastructure can catch up to the original vision.</li><li><strong>Align Incentives in Partnerships.</strong> Misaligned business models or conflicting partner incentives will tear even the best product apart. Ensure every partner — and every internal team — is motivated by the same measure of customer success.</li><li><strong>Let Results Speak for You.</strong> In a saturated market, adoption metrics, behavioral data, and organic growth speak louder than marketing adjectives. Focus on building something so valuable that the usage itself proves the strategy.</li><li><strong>Design for Real Behavior, Not Assumed Demand.</strong> Usage data and observed real-world customer actions must be the ultimate guide for your roadmap. Internal assumptions about what customers <em>should</em> want are the fastest path to irrelevance.</li></ul><h3>Looking Forward — Lessons That Still Matter</h3><p>The story of Genie isn’t just a piece of telecoms history — it’s a blueprint for how transformative innovation happens. Every major technological shift — from mobile to cloud to AI — begins with a change in how we think about customers, value and organisational agility. We were experimenting with behaviours that hadn’t yet formed, building services for devices that didn’t quite exist, and designing for a future that was only just becoming possible.</p><p>That mindset — exploratory, adaptive and deeply customer-centred — remains the key to navigating today’s most complex innovation challenges. As the next wave of transformation unfolds, from AI-driven services to spatial interfaces, the opportunity is the same: to build not just technology, but meaningful experiences that people truly care about.</p><p>The future is never invented in theory. It’s built step by step — through experimentation, iteration and a relentless focus on real human needs. And it’s shaped not by technology itself, but by the experiences we design around it.</p><p><strong>So the challenge for today’s builders is this:</strong> don’t just launch products — shape possibilities. Start with the experience, keep the customer at the centre of every decision, and you might just build the breakthrough the future has been waiting for.</p><h3>References</h3><h4>Core Genie milestones &amp; context</h4><ul><li>The Guardian (Jul 2000) <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/jul/04/internet.efinance"">Upwardly mobile commerce: The arrival of wireless internet access is breeding a second wave of web portals</a> (Genie launch, subscriber numbers)</li><li>BBC News (Feb 1999). <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/285508.stm""><em>Cellnet dials up Internet first</em></a><em>.</em> (Genie launch; “wireless Internet” and “killer applications”).</li><li>WAP Forum / Yahoo!

The point was to learn through repetition, and copying helped these aspiring artists understand what good looked like.

Now that we have tools that help us produce faster than ever, we’ve failed to teach what good work looks like along the way.</p><p>When something feels like it was produced with AI, we discount its quality.

(Public Domain)</figcaption></figure><h3>Barbauld and the practice of imitation</h3><p>In the late 1700s, Anna Laetitia Barbauld was writing poems and essays. She also was teaching at a time when few women had access to formal intellectual training.</p><p>She taught at Warrington Academy, a progressive school in England that served students excluded from elite institutions. Many of her pupils had never been taught how to write with structure or style.</p><p>Her method was simple: Start by copying existing essays and poems. Over time, that helped students develop a sense of their own style by first understanding others’.</p><blockquote>“The mind must be fed by imitation before it can create.”</blockquote><p>To Barbauld, imitation was the path to originality.</p><figure><img alt=""Engraved portrait of Richard Bentley, an 18th-century English classical scholar.

His most famous takedown was <em>The Letters of Phalaris</em>, a widely admired collection of ancient Greek writings once believed to be authentic. Bentley read them and disagreed.</p><p>When the syntax didn’t match, he realized the voice of the piece was all wrong. The references were off and the structure lacked consistency with the rest of the canon. Bentley could hear when something didn’t belong. He didn’t need proof in reference materials and records. Instead, he looked for a pattern he could follow.</p><p>He treated style as evidence and voice as something you could trace.</p><h3>Why it matters</h3><p>When you replace the process of developing expertise with productivity tools, you stop teaching people how to build their voice. Instead, you hand them Mad Libs, templates and mandates like “use AI” but never define how, how much or to what end.</p><p>And then, when the work feels too clean or too unlike the person who wrote it, we don’t ask what the person was trying to say.</p><p>We ask if they cheated.</p><p>That kind of suspicion kills growth. It tells people: Try this, but only in exactly the right way (whatever that means). And when they get it wrong, they don’t get coached. They get judged.</p><p>If AI becomes a source of shame, I think a lot of people will stop using it. They’ll avoid new opportunities, hide their process and aim for ‘safe and small’ outcomes.</p><h3>What to do instead</h3><p>This problem doesn’t fix itself. If we want people to use AI well, we have to define what that means, not just urge adoption and <em>hope</em> for the best. That means setting clear boundaries, offering real feedback and helping people grow into a voice that’s theirs (which can’t happen in a vacuum).</p><p><strong>Barbauld gave us a blueprint for that kind of growth.</strong><br />She showed that imitation, when guided, builds fluency. It helps people understand how ideas flow, how style works and how meaning holds together.</p><p><strong>Bentley gave us the tools to listen.</strong><br />He showed that voice isn’t invisible. It leaves a trail that can be studied, taught and refined (if we care enough to notice it).</p><p>Together, their teaching offers something AI tools can’t:<br /><strong>A path for learning how to sound like yourself.</strong></p><p>We need less suspicion and more systems that help people build toward authorship.</p><p>Voice and style matter. Put in the work to develop your own.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=fc145f3f3a31"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/is-imitation-theft-or-apprenticeship-fc145f3f3a31"">Is imitation theft or apprenticeship?</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Skip Figma and prototype where your product already lives</h4><p>Prototyping and testing new product features or concepts usually means starting from scratch with a blank design canvas. The workflow looks a little like this: UX designers build product screens in Figma, pass the designs for feedback, then developers recreate the same screens in code. Though this is the traditional design and development process we’re used to, the workflow can be slow and redundant.</p><p><strong>Not only does this established process cause inefficiency in product development, but it’s disconnected from the actual product, losing context and real user-interaction behavior.</strong></p><p>But what if you can adapt your design and development workflow to skip the unnecessary rework and keep the user’s context? Being able to prototype directly on your live website’s product pages, like tweaking layouts or exploring features, allows you to cut the time and resources needed to implement and test new ideas.</p><figure><img alt=""Vibe coding with Anima’s “Web-to-code” feature with the AI chat on the left and code preview on the right"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yF0WH6JRq6nAnWjpMQisWg.png"" /><figcaption>Vibe coding with <a href=""https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-to-code-by-anima/paddhneaanoeljlmdepnheehdkaegblo"">Anima’s “Web-to-code”</a> feature</figcaption></figure><p><strong>By vibe coding straight from your website, you keep the design process realistic to the user’s experience, and keep design and implementation in sync from the start.</strong></p><p>You may be thinking of ways you can streamline your own design-development process or if vibe coding is right for you and your team. To answer these questions, let’s explore vibe coding’s benefits and limits when using live websites, demo tools that enable this workflow, and review use cases to determine where this process can be integrated within the design process.</p><h3>Benefits and limits of vibe coding with your website</h3><p><strong>Instead of starting the vibe code process from Figma or Sketch designs, you can cut straight to your live product.</strong> Vibe coding directly on your website avoids duplicate effort (e.g., creating the same UI mockup with slight variations), and keeps the user’s context that gets lost in design tools. This results in prototypes that not only look realistic, but behave like the actual product — making them easier to validate with both users and stakeholders.</p><blockquote><em>For more of an introduction to vibe coding and how it fits in the UX process, check out this article: </em><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/testing-your-ux-ideas-with-vibe-coding-8302620c17af""><em>“Testing your UX ideas with vibe coding.”</em></a></blockquote><h4>Benefits to your website</h4><ul><li><strong>Speed</strong>: By modifying spacing, colors, or users flows right on your site, you eliminate the extra steps of remaking your product screens in any design tool — cutting hours (or even days) from the iteration cycle.</li><li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: Vibe coding in your website keeps behaviors like hover states, responsiveness, and navigation (typically lost in design tools), so the prototype reflects real user interactions with the product.</li><li><strong>Testing confidence</strong>: Because changes are made on top of real product flows, usability testing offers reliable feedback (which you don’t get from artificial prototypes in Figma or Sketch).</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Patagonia’s home page at a mobile breakpoint from Chrome’s dev tools on a desktop screen"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4Ew1U1pkaYa1Bs2Hlq72iQ.png"" /><figcaption>Using a site to vibe code allows you to view mobile and desktop breakpoints; via <a href=""https://www.patagonia.com/home/"">Patagonia</a></figcaption></figure><h4>Limits with vibe coding</h4><ul><li><strong>Messy code</strong>: Depending on the tool, vibe coding can generate code that’s great for exploration but is not production-ready; developers will need to evaluate and possibly rebuild the code.</li><li><strong>Security risks</strong>: When working with live sites or sites with required user sign-in, you need to be careful about exposing sensitive data like user info, tokens, or private content.</li><li><strong>Not scalable for large systems</strong>: Vibe coding works well for small tweaks and user flows, but is not a replacement for building complex features or keeping consistency across platforms.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Slack’s login page to sign in with a company email"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5F12b9_n-luEuqBcDO0byQ.png"" /><figcaption>Vibe coding with authenticated sites can pose security issues; via <a href=""https://slack.com/get-started#/createnew"">Slack</a></figcaption></figure><h3>How to start vibe coding with your site</h3><p>There are plenty of vibe coding tools out there today, but not many let you vibe code directly from your live website. Most focus on creating one to multi-page user flows from a few design mockups from Figma or from AI prompts. These prototypes and the AI-generated code can be helpful, but keep you one step removed from your actual product.</p><p>Let’s get into Anima’s “web to code” feature and Chrome extension to demo how you can vibe code directly from your (or any public) website, then look into other similar tools that offer vibe coding from your live site.</p><h4>“Web to code” demo</h4><ol><li>Copy your website’s URL and paste it into <a href=""https://dev.animaapp.com/?framework=react&amp;language=typescript&amp;styling=tailwind&amp;l2cEngine=auto&amp;importType=link"">Anima’s web to code tool</a></li><li>Choose your preferred framework, language, and styling (or keep the default options), then select the “arrow” icon button</li></ol><blockquote>Note<em>: Anima automatically recognizes your Design System’s UI components; when it creates additional pages, it will reuse the components to maintain consistency.</em></blockquote><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AIExuPUd4fhrx-oZ5ICf6g.png"" /><figcaption>Copy and paste any public website URL into Anima to generate design and code</figcaption></figure><p>3.

Vibe coding speeds up specific points in the workflow where product teams usually get stuck. For instance, designers can generate and test small design tweaks from their existing website without remaking each UI mockup, as well as validate ideas with prototypes that provide real interactions.</p><p>By integrating vibe coding into your design-development process, you can cut unnecessary steps while gaining the output from traditional prototypes. Let’s look into where product teams can most benefit, then look at when vibe coding shouldn’t be used.</p><h4>For designers</h4><ul><li><strong>Ideate with user context</strong>: Instead of designing mockups on static canvases or creating artificial prototypes, you can generate changes on your actual product pages and see how they behave.</li><li><strong>Validate with users</strong>: Using vibe-coded prototypes for user testing gets more realistic feedback versus clickable prototypes made in Figma or Sketch (also prevents “glitchy” prototypes).</li><li><strong>Avoid design tool integration</strong>: Many vibe coding tools are integrated with only Figma (excluding other design tools); with live-site prototyping, designers without Figma can still vibe code.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Builder.io’s home page asking designers to submit a Figma file to start using the tool"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZO6lPrS9ZOQ5SwIVgmQLxg.png"" /><figcaption>Builder.io requires designers to start with a Figma file</figcaption></figure><h4>For developers</h4><ul><li><strong>Experiment faster</strong>: Vibe coding lowers the barrier to testing since developers can make edits without creating a new dev environment each time; so you can validate the change before committing code.</li><li><strong>Prototype without damage</strong>: Since developers are working in a “playground” environment, they can try new things without worrying about breaking the main repository (or anything else).</li></ul><h4>For product teams</h4><ul><li><strong>Close the handoff gap</strong>: Since designers and developers are working from the same context, there are fewer misinterpretations compared to developers implementing from design files and specs.</li><li><strong>Condense design cycles</strong>: Vibe coding eliminates redundant steps, like recreating the same UI mockup over and over again, so ideas can move from concept to testable prototype in a day or two instead of weeks.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Modified Eventbrite prototype generated with Anima including changes requested in the demo"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*S4RkOzydArhP-KfN6jNvfA.png"" /><figcaption>Modified Eventbrite prototype generated with Anima</figcaption></figure><h4>When not to use vibe coding</h4><ul><li>​​<strong>Brand new features</strong>: When there is no existing product page or user flow to build from in the existing website, you need to start with wireframes in design tools instead of vibe coding.</li><li><strong>Complex user journeys</strong>: For multi-step user flows or branching paths, traditional prototyping helps you map everything clearly because vibe coding may miss important context.</li><li><strong>Design Systems</strong>: Design libraries require structured, reusable foundations to create UI components and patterns that are better defined and used in tools like Figma.</li><li><strong>High-level concepts</strong>: When you need to present and communicate abstract ideas or early-stage concepts to stakeholders, low-fidelity wireframes or static user journeys are often more effective.</li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Vibe coding directly on your live website changes how teams can explore new ideas. This process reduces the redundant work in traditional design-to-dev workflows, while keeping user interactions accurate and in-context.</p><p>Not only is vibe coding from your website a workflow shift, it aligns design and implementation from the start of any iteration cycle — balancing quality, speed, and collaboration while building a better product experience.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ce52eef25d95"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/vibe-code-straight-from-your-website-ce52eef25d95"">Vibe code straight from your website</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

In recent months it feels like another seismic shift is underway with agentic AI. So what exactly is this wave, and how is it reshaping the landscape we thought we knew?</p><p>I lead the product design team at <a href=""https://www.datarobot.com/"">DataRobot</a>, an enterprise platform that helps teams build, govern and operate AI models and agents at scale. From this vantage point, I’m seeing these changes reshape not just how we design, but also many long-held assumptions about what products <em>are</em> and how they’re built.</p><h3>What’s actually changing</h3><p>Agents are a fundamentally different paradigm to predictive and generative AI. What sets them apart, aside from being multimodal and capable of deep reasoning, is their <em>autonomous</em> nature. It sounds deceptively simple, but when software has agency — the ability to make decisions and take actions on its own — the results can be quite profound.</p><p>This creates a fundamental challenge for companies integrating AI software, which is traditionally built for <em>deterministic</em>, predictable workflows. Agentic AI is inherently <em>probabilistic</em> — the same input can produce different outputs, and agents may take unexpected paths to reach their goals. This mismatch between deterministic infrastructure and probabilistic behavior creates new design challenges around governance, monitoring, and user trust. These aren’t just theoretical concerns, they’re already playing out in enterprise environments. That’s why we partnered with <a href=""https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtc25-S72261/"">Nvidia </a>to build on their AI Factory design and delivered as agentic apps embedded directly into <a href=""https://www.datarobot.com/solutions/partners/sap/"">SAP</a> environments, so customers can run these systems securely and at scale.</p><p>But even with this kind of hardened infrastructure, moving from experimentation to impact remains difficult. Recent<a href=""https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/""> MIT research</a> found that 95% of enterprise generative AI pilots fail to deliver measurable impact, highlighting an industry-wide challenge in moving from prototype to production. Our ‘AI Expert’ service — where specialised consultants work directly with customers to deploy and run agents — delivers outstanding results through personalized support. To extend this level of guidance to a broader customer base, we needed to develop scalable approaches that could address complexity barriers at scale.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of the DataRobot homepage"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rmSUGY7cXdvQpzrUk-UHwQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.datarobot.com/"">Datarobot</a> homepage</figcaption></figure><p>Moving from AI experimentation to production involves significant technical complexity. Rather than expecting customers to build everything from the ground up, we decided to flip the offering and lead instead with a series of <a href=""https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/workbench/wb-apps/app-templates/index.html"">agent and application templates</a> that give them a head start.</p><p>To use a food analogy, instead of handing customers a pantry full of raw ingredients (components and frameworks), we now provide something closer to ‘HelloFresh’ meal kits: pre-scaffolded agent and application templates with prepped components and proven recipes that work out of the box. These templates codify best practices across common customer use cases and frameworks. AI builders can clone them, then swap out or modify components using our platform or in their preferred tools via API.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration showing an architectural diagrm of DataRobot agentic application templates on one side, with sample front-end interfaces on the other side, to illustrate what’s included in these application templates."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*37NA6kRGLHFwuJeKZTwtVQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Use case specific </em>Agentic Application Templates</figcaption></figure><p>This approach is changing how AI practitioners use our platform. One significant challenge is creating front-end interfaces that consume the agents and models — apps for forecasting demand, generating content, retrieving knowledge or exploring data.</p><p>Larger organisations with dedicated development teams can handle this easily. But smaller organisations often rely on IT teams or our AI experts to build these interfaces, and app development isn’t their primary skill.</p><p>We mitigated this by providing customisable <a href=""https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/workbench/wb-apps/app-templates/index.html"">reference apps</a> as starting points. These work if they are close to what you need, but they’re not straightforward to modify or extend. Practitioners also use open-source frameworks like Streamlit, but the quality of these often falls short of enterprise requirements for scale, security and user experience.</p><p>To address this, we’re exploring solutions that use agents to generate dynamic applications — dashboards with complex user interface components and data visualizations, tailored to specific customer needs, all using the DataRobot platform as the back-end. The result is that users can generate production-quality applications in days, not weeks or months.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/1c5c875292b4c38002fa61e15fab4140/href"">https://medium.com/media/1c5c875292b4c38002fa61e15fab4140/href</a><p>This shift towards autonomous systems raises a fundamental question: how much control should we hand over to agents, and how much should users retain? At the product level, this plays out in two layers: the infrastructure AI practitioners use to create and govern workflows, and the front-end apps people use to consume them. Our customers are now building both layers simultaneously — guidance agents configure the platform scaffolding while different generative agents build the React-based applications that sit on top.</p><p>These aren’t prototypes — they’re production applications serving enterprise customers. AI practitioners who might not be expert app developers can now create customer-facing software that handles complex workflows, rich data visualization, and business logic. The agents handle React components, layout and responsive design, while the practitioners focus on domain logic and user workflows.</p><p>We are seeing similar changes in other areas too. Teams across the organisation are using new AI tools to build compelling demos and prototypes using tools like<a href=""https://v0.dev/""> V0</a>. Designers are working alongside front-end developers to contribute production code. But this democratization of development creates new challenges; now that anyone can build production software, the mechanisms for ensuring quality and scalability of code, user experience, brand and accessibility need to evolve. Instead of checkpoint-based reviews, we need to develop new systems that can scale quality to match the new pace of development.</p><figure><img alt=""Animated GIF showing an example of a DataRobot front-end application for forecasting talent attrition in a fictional company."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*B-SiD2yK-cUbOq8t-_hkvA.gif"" /><figcaption><em>An example of an app built by our field team using </em><a href=""https://v0.dev/""><em>V0</em></a><em> that leverages agent-aware design system docs.</em></figcaption></figure><h3>Learning from the control paradox</h3><p>There are lessons from our AutoML (automated machine learning) experience that apply here. While AutoML workflows helped democratize access for many users, some experienced data scientists and ML engineers felt control was being taken away. We had automated the parts they found most rewarding — the creative, skilled work of selecting algorithms and crafting features — while leaving them with the tedious infrastructure work they actually wanted to avoid.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of the DataRobot user interface from approximately 2012, showing data uploded an a ‘start’ action button."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LGiOcy4h1eOCe6MHiFmaiA.png"" /><figcaption><em>Earlier version of the DataRobot UI that focused on democratizing access to machine learning</em></figcaption></figure><p>We’re applying this lesson directly to how we build agentic applications. Just as AutoML worked when it automated feature engineering but not always model interpretation, our customers will succeed when agents handle UI implementation while AI/ML experts retain control over the agentic workflow design. The agents automate what practitioners don’t want to do (component wiring, state management) while preserving agency over what they do care about (business logic, user experience decisions).</p><p>Now, with agentic AI, this tension plays out at a much broader scale with added complexity. Unlike the AutoML era when we primarily served data scientists and analysts, we now target a broader range of practitioners including App developers who might be new to AI workflows, along with the agents themselves as end users.</p><p>Each group has different expectations about control and automation. Developers are comfortable with abstraction layers and black-box systems — they’re used to frameworks that handle complexity under the hood, but they still want to debug, extend, and customise when needed. Data scientists still want explainability and intervention capabilities. Business users just want results.</p><p>But there’s another user type we’re designing for: the agents themselves. This represents a fundamental shift in how we think about user experience. Agents aren’t just tools that humans use — they’re collaborative partners that need to interact with our platform, make decisions, and work alongside human practitioners.</p><figure><img alt=""Visual representation of the different DataRobot practitioner archetypes, mapped along a vertical axis of ‘code maturity’ and a horizontal axis of ‘AI/ML maturity’."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xnKXPra7MJxuwjYOzHsKPg.png"" /><figcaption><em>Overview of the users who interact with the DataRobot platform</em></figcaption></figure><p>When we evaluate new features now, we ask: will the primary user be human or agent? This changes everything about how we approach information architecture, API design, and even visual interfaces (if required). Agents need different types of feedback, different error handling, and different ways to communicate their reasoning to human collaborators.</p><p>Looking ahead, it’s possible agents may emerge as primary users of enterprise platforms. This means designing for human-agent collaboration rather than just human-computer interaction, creating systems where agents and humans can work together effectively, each contributing their strengths to the workflow.</p><h3>From designing flows to architecting systems</h3><p>These changes challenge fundamental assumptions about what a product <em>is</em>. Traditionally, products are solutions designed to solve specific problems for defined user groups. They usually represent a series of trade-offs: teams research diverse user needs, then create single solutions that attempt to strike the best balance of multiple use cases. This often means compromising on specificity and simplicity to achieve broader appeal.</p><p>Generative AI has already begun disrupting this model by enabling users to bypass traditional product design and development processes entirely. Teams can now get to an approximation of an end result almost instantaneously, then work backward to refine and perfect it. This compressed timeline is reshaping how we think about iteration and validation.</p><p>But agentic AI offers something more fundamental: the ability to generate products and features on demand. Instead of static experiences that try to serve a broad audience, we can create dynamic systems that generate specific solutions for specific contexts and audiences. Users don’t just get faster prototypes — they get contextually adaptive experiences that reshape themselves based on individual needs.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of different product development processs, such as waterfall, agile and AI, using vehicles as an analogy for how they work."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*F5vDEkRuurvkLcRVen8jxQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>How the product development process is evolving with AI. Credit unknown.</em></figcaption></figure><p>This shift changes the role of design and product teams. Instead of executing individual products, we become architects of systems that can create products. We curate the constraints, contexts, and components that agents use to generate experiences while maintaining brand guidelines, product principles, and UX standards.</p><p>But this raises fundamental questions about interaction design. How do affordances work when interfaces are generated on demand? Traditional affordances — visual cues that suggest how an interface element can be used — rely on consistent patterns that users learn over time. Interestingly, AI tools like <a href=""https://cursor.com/"">Cursor</a>, V0, and Lovable address this challenge by leveraging well-established UX frameworks like Tailwind and ShadCN. Rather than creating novel patterns that users need to learn, these tools generate interfaces using robust, widely-adopted design systems that provide familiar starting points. When agents generate interfaces contextually using these established frameworks, users encounter recognizable patterns even when the specific interface is new.</p><p>At DataRobot, we’ve approached this challenge by systematizing our design process and standards as agent-aware artifacts. We’ve converted our Figma design system into machine-readable markdown files that agents can consume directly. Using Claude, we translated our visual design guidelines, component specifications, and interaction principles into structured text that can be dropped as context into AI tools like Cursor, V0, and Lovable.</p><figure><img alt=""Visual represetnation titled  ‘agent aware artifacts’ showing a figma design system on the left, with an arrow pointing to a ‘claude ai’ icon and another pointing to a screenshot of a coding tool with a markdown file loaded, titled ‘design-system.md’ to communicate how design artifacts are being translated into formats for agent consumption."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HVd30Uc-MS7DzkxPATxsHg.png"" /><figcaption><em>Translating design files into agent-aware artifacts like markdown files.</em></figcaption></figure><p>This approach allows us to maintain design quality at scale. Instead of manually reviewing every generated interface, we encode our design standards upstream, ensuring that agents generate consistent, accessible, and brand-appropriate experiences by default.</p><p>We’re already seeing this in action within DataRobot itself. Our AI Experts use these agent-aware design artifacts when building agentic applications, maintaining design consistency through our systematized guidelines while focusing on the unique business logic and user workflows.</p><h3>What this means for product &amp; design leaders</h3><p>I previously wrote about how the <a href=""https://john-moriarty.medium.com/the-future-of-ai-design-navigating-challenges-and-opportunities-2170c92d80bd?source=friends_link&amp;sk=cfcc997fa7c1de3641bbe6194356f9bf"">boundaries between disciplines are blurring</a>. What shape the product triad will take, or if it remains a triad at all, is unclear. While it’s likely that design will absorb many front-end development tasks (and vice-versa), and some PMs will take on design tasks, I don’t think any roles will disappear <em>entirely</em>. There will always be a need for specialists; while individuals can indeed do a lot more than before, there is only a certain amount of context that we can all retain.</p><p>So while we might be able to execute more, we still need people who can go deep on complex problems along with a level of craft that becomes increasingly valuable as a differentiator. In a world where anyone can create anything, the quality of execution and depth of understanding that comes from specialization will be what separates good work from exceptional work.</p><blockquote><strong>The companies that are going to distinguish themselves are the ones that show their craft. That they show their true understanding of the product, the true understanding of their customer, and connect the two in meaningful ways.</strong></blockquote><p>— <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaDsk4iH1aw"">Krithika Shankarraman</a> (Product, OpenAI)</p><figure><img alt=""Animated gif showing the traditional product triad of product, engineering and UX design that blurs in and out, suggesting the boundaries between these roles are blurring."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LcnWd3ZVITmmmsVBgGvAfQ.gif"" /><figcaption>The blurring boundaries of the product triad.</figcaption></figure><p>As these boundaries blur and new capabilities emerge, it’s worth remembering what remains constant. The hard problems remain hard:</p><ul><li>Understanding people and their needs within complex contexts. <br /><em>What unmet needs are we addressing?</em></li><li>Building within interdependent systems and enterprise constraints. <br /><em>Will this work with existing architectures?</em></li><li>Aligning technical capabilities to business value. <br /><em>Is this solving a problem that matters?</em></li></ul><p>Our role as design leaders is evolving from crafting individual experiences to architecting systems that <em>generate</em> experiences. We’re evolving from designing screens to designing systems that can make contextual decisions while maintaining design integrity.</p><p>This changes our methodology fundamentally. Instead of designing for personas or generalised scenarios, we’re designing systems that adapt to individual contexts in real-time. Rather than creating single user journeys, we’re building adaptive frameworks that change pathways based on user intent and behavior.</p><p>User research also evolves: we still need to understand human needs, but now we must translate those insights into rules and constraints that agents can interpret. The challenge isn’t just knowing what users want, but encoding that knowledge to maintain design quality across infinite interface variations.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/0adf05b68982681f7579e5f9734e2af3/href"">https://medium.com/media/0adf05b68982681f7579e5f9734e2af3/href</a><p>This fundamental truth doesn’t change — but our methods for translating human understanding into actionable systems do. The uniquely human work of developing deep contextual understanding becomes more valuable, not less, as we learn to encode that wisdom for AI systems to use effectively.</p><h3>Design quality in an agent-first world</h3><p>This shift toward agent-generated experiences creates new design challenges. If agents are creating interfaces on demand, how do you maintain coherence across an organisation? How do you ensure accessibility compliance? How do you handle edge cases that training data didn’t capture?</p><p>We believe that part of the answer lies in creating foundational artifacts that both humans and agents can consume. At DataRobot, we are currently exploring:</p><ul><li>Making documentation agent-aware using formats like <a href=""https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol"">MCP</a>, <a href=""https://agents.md/"">agents.md</a> and <a href=""https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/llms-txt-overview/"">llms.txt</a>.</li><li>Converting our design system into foundational markdown files that codify principles and patterns, for use in AI development tools.</li><li>Creating automated checks for UI language, accessibility standards, and interaction patterns.</li></ul><p>This approach enables others in our organisation to build compelling applications with AI tools while adhering to our design system and brand consistency. But here’s the crucial insight: while these AI-generated applications might look impressive, the polish can mask underlying UX challenges. As Preston notes:</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/1deda45b93d917a65c099af08ac55b7e/href"">https://medium.com/media/1deda45b93d917a65c099af08ac55b7e/href</a><p>AI tools excel at execution, but they don’t replace the difficult UX work required to ensure you’re executing <em>the right thing</em>.</p><p>This creates a new challenge for design teams: when everyone is a builder, how do we ensure we build the right things and ensure we meet quality standards? We’ve struggled with knowing when to lean in. There are times, like creating demos or throwaway prototypes, when it’s fine for design to be less involved. But there are critical moments when our involvement <em>is</em> important, otherwise poor quality experiences can ship to production. Our customers don’t care about how or who created the products they interact with.</p><p>The key is catching issues as far upstream as possible. This means the documentation and enablement materials that guide how people use and customise our templates have become the new ‘products’ our design team is responsible for. By creating thorough agent-aware guidelines and design system documentation, we can ensure higher quality output at scale.</p><p>But we still need quality checks without slowing down the process too much. We’re still learning how to balance speed with standards — when to trust the system we’ve built and when human design judgment is a must have.</p><h3>Riding the wave</h3><p>The last few years have felt like a rollercoaster because they have been. But I believe our job as designers is to lean into uncertainty, to make sense of it, shape it, and help others navigate it.</p><p>Like Cooper in Interstellar, we’ve recognised that what seemed like distant mountains are actually massive waves bearing down on us. The question isn’t whether the wave will hit, it’s already here. The question is whether we’ll be caught off guard or whether we’ll have prepared ourselves to harness its power.</p><p>Here’s what we’ve learned so far at DataRobot, for anyone navigating this transition:</p><ul><li><strong>Embrace the change &amp; challenge orthodoxies</strong><br />Try new tools and workflows outside your traditional lane. As roles blur, staying relevant means expanding your capabilities</li><li><strong>Build systems, not just products</strong> <br />Focus on creating the foundations, constraints, and contexts that enable good experiences to emerge, rather than crafting every detail yourself</li><li><strong>Focus on the enduring hard things</strong><br />Double down on the uniquely human work of understanding needs, behaviours, and contexts that no algorithm can fully grasp.</li><li><strong>Exercise (your) judgment</strong> <br />Use AI for speed and capability, but rely on your experience and values to decide what’s right.</li></ul><p>AI doesn’t make design irrelevant. It makes the uniquely human aspects of design more valuable than ever. The wave is here, and those who learn to harness it will find themselves in an incredibly powerful position to shape what comes next. This isn’t about nostalgia for how design used to work, it’s about taking an optimistic stance and embracing what’s possible with these technologies, doing things and going further than we ever could before. As <a href=""https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/adapting-episode-3-intel"">Andy Grove</a> put it perfectly:</p><blockquote><strong>Don’t bemoan the way things were, they will never be that way again.

<h4>Why the better AI gets at conversation, the worse we get at questioning it</h4><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a magic 8 ball used as a crystal ball"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1Hye8aYVK6-cw367zTTNDg.png"" /><figcaption>illustration by author</figcaption></figure><p>How do we know when to trust what someone tells us? In person conversations give us many subtle cues we might pick up on, but when they happen with AI system designed to sound perfectly human, we lose any sort of frame of reference we may have.</p><p>With every new model, conversational AI sounds more and more genuinely intelligent and human-like, so much so that every day, millions of people chat with these systems as if talking to their most knowledgeable friend.</p><p>From a design perspective, they’re very successful in the way they feel natural, authoritative and even empathetic, but this very naturalness becomes problematic as it makes it hard to distinguish when outputs are true or simply just plausible.</p><p>This creates exactly the setup for misplaced trust: trust works best when paired with critical thinking, but the more we rely on these systems, the worse we get at it, ending up in this odd feedback loop that’s surprisingly difficult to escape.</p><h3>The illusion of understanding</h3><p>Traditional software is straightforward — click this button, get that result. AI systems are something else entirely because they’re unpredictable as they can make new decisions based on their training data. If we ask the same question twice we might get completely different wording, reasoning, or even different conclusions each time.</p><p>How this<em> thing</em> thinks and speaks in such human ways, <a href=""https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/01/why-artificial-intelligence-often-feels-like-magic.html"">feels like magic</a> to many users. Without understanding what’s happening under the hood, it’s easy to miss that those “magical” sentences are ‘simply’ the most statistically probable chain of words, making these systems something closer to a ‘<a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/9029cc1c-4a3f-42ca-9939-f3ef8e8336ae"">glorified Magic 8 Ball</a>’.</p><p>Back in 2022 when ChatGPT opened to public, I was also admittedly mesmerised by it, and after it proved useful in a couple of real-world situations, I started reaching for it more and more, even for simple questions and tasks.</p><p>Until one day I was struggling with a presentation segment that felt flat compared to the rest and asked <a href=""https://claude.com/product/overview"">Claude</a> for ideas on how to make it more compelling. We came up with a story I could reference, one I was already familiar with, but there was this one detail that felt oddly specific, so I asked for the source.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot from a conversation with Claude"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xmUNlpXiOUKjKpgrEXoyMQ.png"" /><figcaption>Part of the conversation with Claude (screenshot by author)</figcaption></figure><p>You can imagine my surprise when Claude casually mentioned it had essentially fabricated that detail for emphasis.</p><p>How I could have so easily accepted that made-up information¹ genuinely unsettled me and became the catalyst for me to really try and understand what I was playing with. What I didn’t know at the time was that this behaviour represents exactly what these systems are designed to do: generate responses that sound right, regardless if they’re actually true or not.</p><h3>Human-like, but not human</h3><p>The core problem when it comes to building trust in AI is that the end goal of these systems (utility) works directly against the transparency needed to establish genuine trust.</p><p>To maximise usefulness, AI needs to feel seamless and natural — nobody wants to talk to a robot, its assistance should be almost invisible. We wouldn’t consciously worry about the physics of speech during conversation, so why should we think about AI mechanics? We ask a question, we get an answer.</p><p>But healthy scepticism requires transparency, which inevitably introduces friction. We should pause, question, verify, and think critically about the information we receive. We should treat these systems as the sophisticated <em>tools</em> they are rather than all-knowing beings.</p><p>The biggest players seem to be solving for trust by leaning into illusion rather than transparency.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot from Claude’s interface showing “Gathering my thoughts, be right there…”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*U3eHtyXa_507Z5yFS_1HwA.png"" /><figcaption>Claude thinking indicator (screenshot by author, Sept 2025)</figcaption></figure><p>One key technique is anthropomorphising the interface through language choices. For example, the many “thinking” indicators that appear while actually just preparing a response, it’s a deliberate attempt at building trust. This works brilliantly because these human-like touches make users feel <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/anthropomorphism/"">connected and understood</a>.</p><p>However, giving AI qualities like these thinking indicators, conversational tone, personality, and “empathy” creates two subtle yet critical problems:</p><h4>#1</h4><p>Giving AI human-like qualities, makes us lose the uncertainty signals that would normally help us detect when something is off. Humans naturally show <em>knowing what they don’t know</em> through hesitation, qualifying statements (like “I think…” “maybe…”), or simply by admitting uncertainty. These are very <a href=""https://medium.com/personal-growth/epistemic-humility-dont-expect-to-know-enough-to-be-sure-of-anything-b9db217d0299"">helpful signals</a> that let us know when to be more careful about trusting what someone is saying.</p><p>AI systems however, rarely do this — they can sound equally confident whether they’re giving you the population of Tokyo (which they probably know) or making up a detail about a case study (which they definitely don’t know). That’s why detecting a mistake or a “lie” in these cases can be extremely hard.</p><h4>#2</h4><p>On top of this, users <a href=""https://crestresearch.ac.uk/comment/emotional-over-trust-in-ai-technology/"">are more likely to assume the AI will perform better</a> while feeling a deeper connection to it. So we end up trusting it based on how it <em>feels</em> rather than how well it actually works.</p><p>The industry calls this <a href=""https://pair.withgoogle.com/chapter/explainability-trust/"">trust calibration</a>, which is about finding the right level of trust so that users rely on AI systems appropriately, or in other words, in just the right amount based on what those systems can <em>actually</em> do. This is no easy feat in general, but because AI often sounds confident while being opaque and inconsistent, getting this balance right is extremely challenging.</p><p>So how are companies currently attempting to solve this calibration problem?</p><h3>The limits of current solutions</h3><p>As a solution, there’s a lot of talk around <a href=""https://pair.withgoogle.com/chapter/explainability-trust/"">explainability</a>. This refers to turning AI systems’ hidden logic into something humans can make sense of, helping users decide when to trust the output (and more importantly, when not to do so).</p><p>Yet, this information only appears spontaneously in scenarios like medical or financial advice, or when training data is limited. In more routine interactions — brainstorming, seeking advice — users would need to actively prompt the AI to reveal the reasoning (as I had to do with Claude).</p><p>Imagine constantly interrupting a conversation to ask someone where they heard something. The chat format creates an illusion of natural conversation that ends up discouraging the very critical thinking that explainability is meant to enable.</p><p>Recognising these challenges, companies <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-are-ai-guardrails"">implement various other guardrails</a>: refusal behaviours for harmful tasks, contextual warnings for sensitive topics, or straight up restriction of certain capabilities. These aim to prevent <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/brycehoffman/2024/03/10/automation-bias-what-it-is-and-how-to-overcome-it/"">automation bias</a>: our tendency to over-rely on automated systems.</p><p>These guardrails, tho, have significant limitations. Not only are there <a href=""https://futurism.com/researchers-discover-chatgpt-jailbreak"">known workarounds</a>, but they fail to account for how these tools are actually used by millions of people with vastly different backgrounds and technical literacy.</p><p>The contradiction becomes obvious when you notice where warnings actually appear. ChatGPT’s disclaimer that it “can make mistakes. Check important info” sits right below the input field, yet I wonder how many people actually see it, and of those who do, how many take that advice. After all that effort to anthropomorphise the interface and create connection, a small grey disclaimer hardly feels like genuine transparency.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot from Claude’s interface showing that Claude can make mistakes"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*a5BFiRLHdhtP7f_sODIvLA.png"" /><figcaption>Although tiny, Claude’s disclaimer appears more contextually within the last reply provided (screenshot by author, Sept 2025)</figcaption></figure><p>Companies invest heavily in making AI feel more human and trustworthy through conversational interfaces, while simultaneously expecting users to maintain critical distance through small warnings and occasional guardrails. The result is that these become another form of false reassurance allowing companies to claim plausible deniability while essentially paying lip service to transparency and trust.</p><h3>Scaffolding over crutches</h3><p>This reveals a fundamental flaw in the current approach: they’re asking users to bear the weight of responsible use while providing tools designed to discourage the very scepticism they require. This, not only contradicts established UX principles about designing for your users’ actual capabilities and contexts, but also ignores how trust is actually formed.</p><p>In fact, trust isn’t built through one single intervention, but rather systematically across many touchpoints. So how might we approach this problem differently?</p><figure><img alt=""Black and white photograph of scaffoldings"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*s_UHoBZqO5j9rTxy"" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=""https://unsplash.com/@rgaleriacom?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Ricardo Gomez Angel</a> on <a href=""https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>A first step, I believe, would be ditching the seamless approach and rethinking friction. What if, instead of treating transparency as friction to reduce, design treated it as a capability to build upon? Instead of hiding complexity to fast-track utility, interfaces could gradually build users’ ability to work effectively with AI systems — eventually teaching them not only how to use them responsibly, but when to trust them as well.</p><p>As a parallel, think scaffolding versus crutches. Current AI systems function more like crutches — they provide so much support that users become dependent on them. Users lean on AI for answers without developing the skills to evaluate them, and much like actual crutches, this helps in the moment but prevents underlying capabilities (critical thinking, in this case) from getting stronger over time.</p><h3>Designing transparency as scaffolding</h3><p><a href=""https://odettejansen.nl/scaffolding-as-a-ux-method-for-designing-better-products/"">In a scaffolding model</a> instead, AI systems could be much more flexible and adaptable so to surface transparency and guidance based on the user’s developing skills and the stakes of the decision.</p><p>For example, we could imagine having different modes. A “learning mode” could surface uncertainty more explicitly within responses — alerts prompting users to verify claims the AI cannot back up directly, or inviting users to take answers with a grain of salt. This could happen in expandable sections so as not to intrude on the conversation flow, and as users interact with these components, the interface could gradually reduce explicit prompts while maintaining the underlying safeguards.</p><figure><img alt=""Interface explorations on how a learning mode could look like"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WWrWy5pc5syiXJEPP-risg.png"" /><figcaption>Quick and dirty explorations of a “learning mode” (by author)</figcaption></figure><p>For high-stakes decision, the interface could default to maximum transparency, like for example requiring users to verify factual claims with external sources before accessing final outputs. Visual indicators could distinguish between trained knowledge, recent search results, and generated examples, helping users understand where information comes from.</p><p>This approach would treats AI as temporary support that builds user capabilities rather than replacing them, and instead of optimising for immediate task completion, scaffolding design would help fostering long-term competence by helping users develop verification habits and critical thinking skills.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot from Gemini showing an inline tip on how to refine images"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2WR2u7ct_2J1649QW4g5Bg.png"" /><figcaption>Google’s Gemini offers inline tips while images are being generated and then persist them on screen. This type of content is clearly distinguishable from the rest of the conversation and provides useful and contextual information based on the task the user is performing (screenshot by author, Sept 2025)</figcaption></figure><h3>A trade-off worth making</h3><p>Much of this goes against conventional product design principles around maximising ease of use. Adding these steps and indicators might seem like deliberate obstacles to user engagement… because they are, but that’s the point.</p><p>The friction introduced in this case, would serve a different purpose than arbitrary barriers — it’s protective and educational rather than obstructive. If designed mindfully, friction can help users treat AI tools as scaffolding rather than crutches, by developing the judgment skills needed to work safely with these systems.</p><p>That conversation with Claude taught me something crucial about the gap between how these systems are presented and what they actually are. <br />We face a choice between immediate utility while undermining our critical thinking, or building people up rather than making them dependent by accepting some friction as the price of maintaining our ability to think independently. The path forward isn’t avoiding AI, but demanding better design that teaches us to use these tools wisely rather than depending on them entirely.</p><p><strong>Footnotes<br /></strong>¹ <em>I’m aware that my example here is a pretty silly one compared to the amount of misinformation, bad advice and just factually incorrect tidbits people are potentially exposed to everyday through these interactions.

<figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gsgg-nvGihveBtvYa0v6UQ.png"" /></figure><p>Lan Johnson is a Senior Product Designer at Square. We met over 10 years ago in 2014 in Dallas, at Tekzenit where we both worked as user experience designers.</p><p>Lan is a military brat and grew up in Japan and South Korea, and Guam. Lan’s father retired in Las Vegas and then they eventually moved to Dallas.</p><p>Lan currently lives in Seattle, Washington with her boyfriend and their dog.</p><p>You can find Lan on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/lanjhnson/"">LinkedIn</a>.</p><p><strong>What was your journey getting into product design?<br /></strong>I actually started out thinking I wanted to be a graphic designer. I was really into anime as a kid, and when I got my hands on a (very outdated and pirated) copy of Photoshop 6 at around age 11, I was hooked. In high school, I also taught myself how to code, which opened the door to doing small freelance jobs here and there while I was still in school.</p><p>Eventually, I joined a startup in New York, before moving back to Dallas to finish my degree. From there, I spent about 10 years in consulting, working across different agencies and design shops. That period was fun and full of variety, but I found myself missing the feeling of being deeply connected to a single product.</p><p>In 2020, just a few weeks before the pandemic hit, I made the leap to go in-house. I stayed almost two years in that role, and now I’m continuing my journey at Square.</p><p><strong>For better or worse, how do you think your parents, family, or friends influenced how you approach problem solving in your day to day work?<br /></strong>I had to learn how to problem-solve on my own from a young age, which made me very independent. My family moved around a lot, so I was constantly rebuilding my support system and adapting to new cultures. That experience shaped the way I work today — it taught me how to be flexible, resilient, and comfortable walking into unfamiliar environments.</p><p>Those skills came in handy when I moved into consulting. I had no trouble starting conversations, building relationships quickly, and feeling at ease in different rooms. In high school, I went to a Department of Defense school in East Asia with only about a thousand students total from kindergarten through senior year. With so few people, it felt like being in a small startup — you had to be resourceful, self-sufficient, and figure things out because there weren’t always obvious answers. That mindset has carried through into my approach to design and problem-solving today.</p><p><strong>How would you describe your background at Capital One, Project202 and Tekzenit?<br /></strong>Each place was really different and shaped me in unique ways. At Tekzenit, I was just starting out. It was in the telecom space, and honestly, I was still figuring out how to navigate the corporate world while learning an industry that didn’t end up being directly relevant to me later. But it was an important first step.</p><p>At Project202, I had the chance to work across a wide range of industries and clients. For example, I worked with Southwest Airlines, learning how they assign pilots and cabin crew, which gave me insight into complex scheduling and logistics. I also helped JCPenney retrofit their site to be mobile and desktop friendly, back when responsive design was still a big shift. That variety really sharpened my ability to adapt quickly and problem-solve across different domains.</p><p>Capital One was especially interesting because of how structured and unionized their systems were. They had this massive scheduling platform that auto-generated crew schedules, but it always had to be corrected by hand. Once a year or so, pilots and crew reps from the union would come in to review and debate the schedules, approving what worked and pushing back on what didn’t. It gave me a fascinating look into how large-scale systems intersect with human needs and negotiations.</p><p><strong>How would you describe your current role and experience at Square?<br /></strong>Stepping away from management, I joined Square as an individual contributor, and I’m really happy with that shift. At my last four jobs I was in management, so it feels good to be back in the weeds, hands-on with the work again.</p><p>Previously, I worked on identity verification, so moving into printers recently has been a big jump, but a good one. I think what I missed most in management was the craft. In consulting especially, so much of the role was about selling the work and managing stakeholders, rather than actually building. I enjoyed mentoring and growing talent, but I often felt pulled away from the fun of shipping products with a team.</p><p>At Square, I feel like I’ve come full circle. I get to contribute directly, push projects over the finish line, and rediscover the parts of design that made me love this work in the first place.</p><p><strong>What are the biggest challenges you are currently facing at work?<br /></strong>Right now, my biggest challenge is onboarding into the world of printers. There are so many nuances I didn’t anticipate, especially since I focus on food and beverage, where every kitchen has very specific needs for how things run. Navigating those requirements has been a steep but interesting learning curve.</p><p>Another challenge is balancing engineering costs, business priorities, and what’s ultimately best for the end user. Like all teams, we’re constantly deciding whether to patch immediate issues or invest in longer-term fixes that will pay off later. We’re making progress, but it’s definitely a journey.</p><p><strong>What are some ways that you leverage AI in your workflow?<br /></strong>AI is a big focus for us. Our CEO, Jack Dorsey, is very forward-looking when it comes to future technologies like Bitcoin and decentralized identity, so adopting AI has become a company-wide initiative. We use a tool called Goose that allows us to automate some tasks. It saves me from having to wait on a data team to pull stats I can access the information I need instantly, which is incredibly helpful.</p><p>Personally, I also use ChatGPT for writing tasks since it’s just more efficient, and I’ve been experimenting with v0 to prototype. That tool can be a little frustrating at times, but it’s also fun and pushes me to think about design workflows in new ways.</p><p><strong>What are parts of your job where you find using AI unnecessary or inefficient?<br /></strong>AI is mostly useful as a baseline. I don’t rely on it heavily in my day-to-day design work, since it can’t really handle more sophisticated tasks. Where I do find it helpful is when teammates who aren’t as design focused, like PMs, use it to get their ideas across. Even if the output isn’t perfect, it gives us something concrete to react to.</p><p>Recently, I organized a V0 prototyping workshop where participants used AI to create solutions for the same problem. None of the prototypes were perfect, but I was able to pull useful pieces from each. So while AI isn’t my main tool, it does provide a good starting point.</p><p><strong>What are the most important aspects of pitching your design work to stakeholders?<br /></strong>For me, the most important part is setting the right context. I’ve found that when I take the time to explain the problem, why it matters, and the broader landscape we’re working within, stakeholders are naturally more aligned with my design decisions. Jumping straight into the solution can leave gaps, but grounding the conversation in the “why” builds trust and clarity.</p><p>I often include a few introductory slides or notes at the beginning of my Figma files for this reason. It gives everyone a shared foundation and makes the actual design discussion more productive.</p><p><strong>Where do you get your design inspiration from?<br /></strong>I use Dribbble a lot, but lately I’ve been really inspired by the resurgence of 90s aesthetics. I especially love 35mm film because it feels so raw and honest. Square has been leaning into that vibe too, with a stronger focus on photography and visual storytelling that highlights our sellers. I’m excited to see our design move more in that direction.</p><p><strong>What’s one failure or misstep that taught you something invaluable?<br /></strong>I learned a lot during my time at AT&amp;T, which often felt like trial by fire. The work environment was chaotic, and I made the mistake of pushing myself too hard, working while sick, putting in extra hours, and sacrificing balance. In hindsight, none of that effort really mattered, because it wasn’t appreciated and didn’t change the outcome. That experience taught me the importance of work-life balance and setting boundaries.</p><p>I also got my first crash course in corporate politics. I had to learn how to navigate different personalities, especially difficult ones. For example, there was a teammate who constantly needed to feel important, and if you didn’t give him that, he could make things unnecessarily difficult. I eventually figured out how to work through a proxy to get what I needed. As frustrating as it was, it taught me how to manage around egos and still get work done, something I carry with me today.</p><p><strong>When you start on a new design team, where do you spend your time and energy?<br /></strong>When I join a new team, the first thing I do is dig through all the files I can get my hands on: org charts, Figma files, documentation, anything available. That exploration helps me form better questions and makes my one-on-ones more productive.</p><p>I also schedule 1:1s with my core team, partners, and anyone I’ll be working closely with. A lot of those conversations are informal, just getting to know each other on a personal level, which I find really valuable. But when it comes to PMs or engineering leads, I’ll bring specific questions based on what I’ve already uncovered. That way, instead of a vague chat, I walk away with concrete answers or more resources to dive into.</p><p><strong>Do you work on any side projects outside of work?<br /></strong>Lately, I’ve been struggling to enjoy my hobbies the way I used to, but I’ve been trying to make space for them again. Drawing has always been a big part of my creative life; it’s actually what led me into design in the first place. I’m especially drawn to food illustration, and I’ve been experimenting with watercolors, alcohol markers, and colored pencils to get back into it.</p><p>I’ve also been getting into photography. I recently picked up a film camera and I’m looking forward to bringing it with me on upcoming trips to New York and San Francisco. For me, these side projects are less about output and more about reconnecting with the creative activities that inspire me outside of work.</p><p><strong>What are the most important qualities you look for in a design leader?<br /></strong>Humility is the big one. Of course, a good leader should know their craft and be able to guide a team, but at this level those qualities are often a given. What really stands out to me is whether they can say no and whether they can admit when they’re wrong. If a leader can do those two things, chances are they’re strong in the other areas that matter too.</p><p><strong>How do you balance business goals with design integrity when they’re at odds?<br /></strong>I think about it the same way I think about relationships. Compromise alone doesn’t really solve anything. If one side simply gives in, it often leads to resentment. Instead, I try to collaborate closely with the team to understand the trade-offs and find a solution that works for everyone. There are usually many ways to slice an experience: some features can be a fast follow, or we can plan milestones that eventually reach the same outcome in a more balanced way.</p><p>Of course, there are cases where trade-offs are unavoidable, like when legacy code ties everyone’s hands. In those situations, it’s about recognizing the limitation and planning for the larger migration effort that will ultimately make better solutions possible.</p><p><strong>What skills do you find relevant to product design that are not taught in school?<br /></strong>One of the biggest lessons I had to learn early on was how to protect myself in the workplace. As a younger designer, I often felt taken advantage of, and no one had prepared me for that. I always encourage people to read up on employment laws and understand their rights. Ideally, you’ll also have a manager or senior teammate who can help you navigate those situations.</p><p>Another important skill is knowing when not to overwork. In product design, we’re rarely saving lives, so putting in constant overtime doesn’t necessarily create better results. In fact, protecting your peace and maintaining balance makes you a better creative, because good decisions and strong design work come from clarity and energy, not burnout.</p><p><strong>What are the most common aspects in designer portfolios that bother you?<br /></strong>One thing I’ve noticed is that many portfolios still lean on process checklists, showing every step of the design process without really explaining the thinking behind it. What I’m really looking for is decision-making: why you chose a certain methodology, what you learned, where you failed, and the trade-offs you had to make along the way. Every project involves trade-offs, and understanding those is often more valuable than a polished checklist.</p><p>I’ll admit, writing case studies is tough, and I don’t always enjoy it myself. One tip I picked up at Square is to keep a “hype doc,” a running log of your accomplishments, metrics you moved, and decisions you influenced. If you spend even an hour a month updating it, you’ll have a backlog of material that makes writing case studies so much easier later. I struggle to keep it up myself, but it’s an invaluable habit.</p><p><strong>Do you have any tips for designers trying to break into the product design world?<br /></strong>When you’re starting out, the biggest challenge is building work you can actually show in applications. My advice is to pick a problem you personally care about and design a solution end to end. Avoid random problem generators; when the problem is real to you, your work will feel more authentic. You can even use tools like V0 to prototype without needing engineering support, which makes it easier to bring your ideas to life.</p><p>I’ve seen great examples of this. At Tekzenit, one intern designed an app to help their sister manage diabetes. It wasn’t just a design exercise; it was personal and meaningful. Projects like that stand out.</p><p>Beyond the work itself, do your homework. Learn about your rights as an employee, research salary ranges so you can advocate for yourself, and come prepared to interviews. And don’t underestimate the power of networking. Reach out to people on LinkedIn who work at companies you admire and ask for 15–30 minutes of their time. Even better if they’re local, because those connections can turn into ongoing mentorship.</p><p><strong>Have you gotten your jobs through referrals or cold applications?</strong></p><p>Almost every job I’ve had has come through a referral. The one exception was early in my career when I cold-applied to an agency that focused on lawyers. I only stayed there for a few months because the environment was really toxic.</p><p>After that, I started leaning on my network more. I ended up working at the same company as my brother, who needed a WordPress developer, and then moved on to Tekzenit after a referral from JK (our mutual friend), who I had almost hired at my previous role. Later, I joined Project202 by following Andy and Ryan, who I knew from Texas. Building those connections made each transition much smoother than applying cold.</p><p><strong>How do you see the product designer role evolving in the next few years?<br /></strong>I think product design will continue to shift beyond just creating visuals and flows and move more toward empathy and problem-solving. In many ways, our role already overlaps with product management, but we bring a different lens by championing the user. That perspective is still something many organizations struggle to fully embrace.</p><p>AI will likely take on more of the executional work, but I believe the real value of designers will be in weaving stories, framing decisions, and making sure user needs stay at the center. That is the part of the role I do not see being automated anytime soon, and hopefully what will keep us not just relevant but essential.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=530d9054fde6"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/interview-with-lan-johnson-senior-designer-at-square-530d9054fde6"">Interview with Lan Johnson, Senior Designer at Square</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<p><em>Welcome to</em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/money-diary""><em> </em>Money Diaries</a><em> where we are tackling the ever-present taboo that is money. We’re asking real people how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period — and we’re tracking every last dollar.<br /><br />Today: a senior PR and communications manager who has a $220,000 joint income and who spends some of her money this week on a stitch crochet kit that was an impulse buy.</em></p>



<p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Senior manager, PR and communications<br /><strong>Industry:</strong> Retail<br /><strong>Age:</strong> 35<br /><strong>Location:</strong> Brooklyn<br /><strong>Salary:</strong> $112,128<br /><strong>Joint Income/Financial Setup:</strong> ~$220,000. My partner A., freelances so his income varies around $60,000-$120,000 depending on how busy he stays. We split most things 50/50. We are domestic partners and he is on my company’s health insurance plan, so he also pays me back the additional deduction and taxes taken out of my paycheck to cover him.<br /><strong>Assets:</strong> 401(k): $74,513; Roth IRA: $14,841.<br /><strong>Debt:</strong> $5,015 on credit cards.<br /><strong>Paycheck Amount (Bi-Weekly):</strong> $2,518 after taxes and deductions + $222 from my partner.<br /><strong>Pronouns:</strong> She/her<br /><br /><strong>Monthly Expenses<br /><br />Housing Costs:</strong> $1,660 for my half of a one-bedroom.<br /><strong>401(k): </strong>5% contribution with 4% employer match.<br /><strong>Transit Deductions:</strong> $50, pre tax.<br /><strong>Pet Insurance:</strong> $26 for my half.<br /><strong>Gym: </strong>$19<br /><strong>Phone: </strong>$75<br /><strong>Utilities: </strong>Varies anywhere from $150-$250.</p>



<p><strong>Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?<br /></strong>Yes, college was always expected. I come from an immigrant family, and everything my parents did was to set my siblings and myself up for a future. I was a high-achieving student at a competitive public school, and attended a top state university. My parents participated in a 529 plan and pre-purchased my in-state tuition when I was around 8 years old, making it considerably inexpensive. I believe they paid $22,000 for all four years, which I was extremely grateful for.<br /><br /><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?<br /></strong>We were middle class but my parents were very frugal, since they both grew up poor in their home countries. Since arriving in the US, it’s always been very important for them to have a great credit score, so they never missed a payment and saved every penny. We hardly ever ate out and only went on a vacation maybe every other year. However, my mom was also able to retire early, and I know they will also leave a comfortable inheritance for my sibling and myself.<br /><br /><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?<br /></strong>My first job was a hostess at a restaurant when I was 15. I mainly got the job to start earning pocket money for myself. I worked for a few years in the restaurant industry throughout high school and saved enough to buy a used car (my parents’ old car), as well as for a solo trip to Europe when I turned 18 and graduated. I had only been to Canada and Mexico previously.<br /><br /><strong>Did you worry about money growing up?<br /></strong>A bit: we could afford all the essentials but never had “fun” money. I got used to shopping for things on sale or thrifting, which is something I still carry with me to this day. There were lots of times in high school when I would wish we had money to buy the trendy things I saw other girls wearing. I do remember one time in elementary school, we were going on a “Little House on the Prairie” field trip, and we had to buy these old-fashioned costumes, but they were pricey and my mom couldn’t afford them. I tried to tell the teacher I was going to skip the field trip but she insisted on it. We ended up finding something at Goodwill, even though it was not the exact style. However, I’m glad my parents instilled a frugality mindset in me now, because it helps me budget an average salary in an expensive city.<br /><br /><strong>Do you worry about money now?<br /></strong>Yes, more so now. Even though I can split expenses with my partner A., we are both victims of lifestyle creep from time to time. Most of our disposable income goes towards going out, eating out, and traveling. I admit I do also have a bit of a shopping problem (especially working in fashion!) which has accumulated a bit of credit card debt.<br /><br /><strong>At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?<br /></strong>At 22, when I graduated. I worked part time throughout college but my parents still helped out with certain things like my car insurance. I don’t have a financial safety net right now, which is something I am going to work towards once I pay off my credit cards. Technically, I could use my 401(k) in an emergency, and both A. and I have supportive parents who would help us out if absolutely needed. But I prefer to be independent and have my own funds.<br /><br /><strong>Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.<br /></strong>Yes, last year my parents started my Roth IRA and contribute the max $7,000 every year, as I did not want to contribute beyond my 401(k). This is partially a hobby of my mother’s, who has been playing with the stock market since she retired early. She likes to “play” with my retirement money but will give any earnings to me. Win-win.</p>



<h3><strong>Day One: Wednesday</strong></h3>



<p>7:30 a.m. — I wake up slightly earlier than usual since I have a meeting at 9 a.m. on the dot, and we are in office most days now. I take my morning probiotic and drink a cup of water: I have a sensitive stomach and find taking probiotics and eating a healthy, mostly non-processed diet helps. Afterwards, I start getting ready: Too Faced mascara, Anastasia brow gel, NARS tinted moisturizer/sunscreen, Charlotte Tilbury bronzer, and Merit blush balm. I keep this routine to 10 minutes max. I pack some pre-made boiled eggs, my za’atar chicken and rice pilaf lunch (which was the leftovers from last night’s dinner) and take the subway to work (which is covered by my prepaid transit card).</p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — On the way, one of my friends texts in a group chat about a trip coming up. We are all going to France for a wedding, and then planning a day trip to a vineyard afterwards. We each owe $47 for the bus round-trip. I venmo her since she will pay in Euros for all of us. <strong>$47</strong></p>



<p>9 a.m. — I peel my eggs and make Earl Grey tea at work (I stopped drinking coffee during the pandemic). I also take some fiber gummies my mom sent me (she sends me a lot of vitamins and supplements).</p>



<p>12:30 p.m — Work is mainly uneventful, as it’s quiet during the summer. I eat the lunch I bought. There were visitors for a meeting, and they had leftover pasties, so I also have a mini croissant as my dessert. I hardly ever eat sweets, but I’ve been good at eating healthy and cooking almost all my meals lately, so I allow myself this treat.</p>



<p>5:15 p.m. — I leave the office a bit early and head to the gym. There are massive train delays due to the rain so it takes me nearly an hour to get to my home station, near where the gym is. </p>



<p>7 p.m. — On the way home from the gym, I stop in at the Walgreens next door, since I am out of toner. I buy Thayer’s Witch’s Hazel ($14.99) and some cotton balls ($4). It’s amazing how much things are inflated — the same toner was always $9.99 before COVID-19!! <strong>$19.24</strong></p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — I quickly down an Oath Nutrition Clear Whey protein shake in Frosty Lemonade and start dinner. I make a soup with shrimp, mushrooms, and tomatoes, using Maesri Thai Tom Yum Soup paste. I love to cook and hate spending money on eating out unless it’s with friends or for a special occasion. I read a lot of cooking blogs and have found Maesri to be one of the most cheap and authentic Thai brands. The soup is yummy, and my partner A. and I eat two-thirds of it for dinner. I have a work lunch tomorrow, so the leftovers will be A.’s lunch. Afterwards, we relax and watch <em>Sorry, Baby</em>. A. is a big cinephile and pays for all our streaming subscriptions and any movie rentals. Before we dated, I only had Netflix and watched everything on my laptop. He was quite horrified by this and now we have a 75-inch screen tv and a Sonos surround-sound system.</p>



<p>10:30 p.m. — I walk the dog and prepare for bed. Double-cleanse with Aprilskin cleansing balm, Eminence daily exfoliating cleanser, Thayer’s toner, Glow Recipe blackberry retinol, and Farmacy honey halo moisturizer. This is a bit early for me, but I’m tired and fall asleep quickly!</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $66.24</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Two: Thursday</strong></h3>



<p>6:30 a.m. — I wake up early for some reason, maybe because I did go to bed early. I lay in bed for nearly an hour and then get up. I take my probiotic and go through my makeup routine. Today for breakfast, I pack a Chobani 2% mango Greek yogurt since I’ve eaten hard-boiled eggs three days in a row now. I do love my eggs though!</p>



<p>9 a.m — Arrive at work and it’s another quiet day. We were three days a week for a long time and just went up to four days. A lot of people are really unhappy about this, especially as not everyone is following the mandate. </p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — Head to my work lunch. It’s at a trendy steakhouse and the vendors I’m meeting order a bunch of apps to share. I go with a butter salad salad with grilled steak as my main since I indulge a bit on the apps. They pay.</p>



<p>7 p.m. — Home and thinking about what to eat as we are mostly out of groceries. A. says he is meeting up with the boys at a new taco spot. I’m invited but he warns me it’s a boys night. I decide a quiet night by myself sounds much more appealing. I make a Costco salmon burger we had in the freezer and alternate between reading <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> and playing with my dog until bedtime.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $0</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Three: Friday</strong></h3>



<p>8:30 a.m. — I sleep in because I’m WFH today! I didn’t used to sleep so much but ever since COVID-19, I became a deep sleeper and must get at least seven or eight hours every night. I lay in bed since I don’t really have a morning routine during WFH. I chat with A. about needing to go on our weekly grocery run today or this weekend. He is not enthused. I know I will need to wait until he is hungry to bring it up again.</p>



<p>9:30 a.m. — It’s payday, so I make a $500 payment to my credit card that has the highest interest rate (I also paid $1,500 the last payday, aggressively trying to pay this down). The rest I will need for rent next week and extra cash coming up for my trip next month. I check on some work emails but it’s mostly quiet. We have summer Fridays so around 1 p.m. I start logging off. <strong>$500</strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — Since we skipped breakfast this morning due to sleeping in, I decide to make us a big brunch. I make bacon, Birch Benders vegan protein pancakes, fried eggs, and leftover sourdough I got from the farmers’ market last week.</p>



<p>4 p.m — I suggest taking the dog to the park to enjoy the nice day (the last couple of days were rainy). I am also trying to up my step count to hit 10,000 a day because I keep hearing it’s an underrated way to get fit. We walk to the park and decide to make it a longer walk and end up going to Greenpoint to try their fabulous restaurant scene. Neither of us are super hungry so we get happy hour drinks first. We stop by a Mexican restaurant that has bar stools outside on a lively street. I get a rosé and my boyfriend gets a beer. He pays (I am not a big drinker so he tends to pay for my drinks).</p>



<p>7 p.m. — The restaurant next to us has outdoor diners eating an amazing-looking panzanella salad. We go for it and it’s delicious. I get a filet mignon with side salad for my main and he gets a pesto pasta with lamb ragu. We also both get Guinness — it’s so rare to see this on a menu outside of Irish pubs! We discuss going on a day trip upstate tomorrow to take advantage of the nice weather all weekend. <strong>$72.50</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $572.50</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Four: Saturday</strong></h3>



<p>8:30 a.m. — Apparently my body likes routine: I could not sleep in until 9 a.m. A. is still asleep so I take the dog out for his morning walk. I make some bacon and eggs because I want to save our appetite for when we are upstate.</p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — After a bit of a slow start, we head out to Grand Central to catch an 11:55 a.m. train to Cold Spring. We get there early so we can grab seats. <strong>$15.25</strong></p>



<p>1:17 p.m. — Arrive in Cold Spring. It’s late and we still need to eat lunch, so we do a short loop that is right on the river and has a small outlook trail. A. wants oysters so we go to a quaint seafood restaurant with outdoor seating and river views. We share oysters and I also get two glasses of rosé and a seafood pasta. A. gets two beers, gazpacho, and a big bowl of mussels. It’s cash only, so he goes to the ATM. (The meal was $80. We’ll split the expenses later, as we have a shared tracker.)</p>



<p>3:45 p.m. — We walk around the small downtown and shop at the local boutiques. We go to a candle shop (I love candles), but A. decides he wants to buy a diffuser to have a nice scent 24/7. I buy a stitching crochet kit with a funny message. <strong>$19.51</strong></p>



<p>5:00 p.m. — We still have 30 minutes until we have to catch the train home, so we find a wine bar and have a quick drink. He gets a beer and I get an orange wine. I put down my card since he paid for lunch. <strong>$16.82</strong></p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — Buy train tickets quickly on the app and catch the train back to the city! <strong>$15.25</strong></p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — Back in the city and we have dinner plans to catch up with a friend. We drop the dog off at home and meet her at a Michelin-starred Vietnamese restaurant. I am still so full from lunch so I just order an appetizer and a salad, while A. orders a huge plate. I have one glass of wine while they both have two drinks. My friend and I didn’t eat much, so we pay a bit then A. covers most of the bill. <strong>$48</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $114.83</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Five: Sunday</strong></h3>



<p>8:30 a.m. — Feeling slightly hungover from the couple of drinks I had yesterday, and not sleeping quite enough. We lounge in bed for a couple more hours and finally get up to make breakfast before grocery shopping. We go to a specialty shop nearby to get fresh Shewolf bakery bread and also pick up some ’nduja (Italian spreadable salami) and boquerones (Spanish anchovies) to snack on later. A. makes poached eggs to go with the bread and the nduja. <strong>$23</strong></p>



<p>1 p.m. — Weekly Trader Joe’s run. We get two bouquets of flowers, jasmine rice, tofu, cut butternut squash, green beans, cilantro, parsley, tomatoes, shredded carrot, edamame, avocado oil, arugula, lemons, limes, chicken breasts, tuna, olives, tea, oat creamer, oven roasted turkey, white cheddar corn puffs, frozen shrimp rolls, and frozen chicken wontons. <strong>$77.65</strong></p>



<p>2:00 p.m. — When we get home I realized I forgot canned coconut milk. I go to a nearby grocery store and pick up a can, as well as a couple of Chobani and Fage 2% Greek yogurts. I hate fat-free yogurt and also don’t want full-fat, so these are a happy medium. I don’t bother adding this to our shared expense sheet since it’s not much. <strong>$10.37</strong></p>



<p>4 p.m. — I had made an appointment to get a haircut at a Chinatown salon that I saw on TikTok that does $40 haircuts which includes a nice head/scalp massage. I am skeptical but I have naturally straight hair and I just need a trim, so I figure they can’t mess it up that bad. The head massage was more like a scalp scratching, not relaxing at all. But the haircut is pretty decent! I get a good trim and some face-framing layers. I like my hair stylist and her English is good. I tip $10. <strong>$50</strong></p>



<p>6 p.m. — Home and time to make dinner. I make a Thai red curry with the groceries we got today and a can of curry paste I had. It’s delicious and our leftovers will be lunch tomorrow. We watch some random movie and pass out early.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $161.02</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Six: Monday</strong></h3>



<p>8:30 a.m — Morning routine and head to the subway. Because we were three days in office for a long time, I only opted to load $50 per month on my prepaid transit card this year. This lasts me half the month, so I just end up paying with my card the rest of the time. <strong>$2.90</strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — Eat my leftovers lunch and go for a 30-minute walk to help with digestion and get steps in.</p>



<p>3:30 p.m — Browse the Abercrombie sale online as I am thinking about getting some barrel pants for the fall. I add four things to my cart to meet the $100 free shipping minimum and plan on returning most things to the store. I do have quite the shopping problem (hence the credit card debt), so I decide to think about it overnight and wait until tomorrow to order.</p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — Leave work and go to the gym. Tap credit card to pay for the metro card. <strong>$2.90</strong></p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — Dinner is tom yum fried rice with the leftover paste I had from last week. It’s an open package so I’m trying to use it up. Fairly tasty, but not much different than Thai fried rice I’ve made and had before. Packed the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $5.80</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Seven: Tuesday</strong></h3>



<p>8:30 a.m. — Morning routine and head to subway, another tap to pay. <strong>$2.90</strong></p>



<p>10:30 a.m. — I see items in my Abercrombie cart have an extra 15% off. That’s a sign, right? I spend $160 but plan on only keeping one thing and returning the rest. <strong>$160</strong></p>



<p>3 p.m. — My coworker remarks how she needs more work clothes now that we are in the office more days. We browse Uniqlo’s JW Anderson collab and decide to make a quick run to the Uniqlo store across the street from us to check it out. I end up buying a boxy Oxford, straight-leg jeans, and a bra tank top that was on sale. All great basics that I’m super excited about. <strong>$90</strong></p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — Leave work and go to the gym. Tap to pay again. <strong>$2.90</strong></p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — Spend the rest of the evening trying on outfits and starting to plan for our trip soon! </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $255.80</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>“I went out to eat more than usual this weekend, because we went upstate. I didn’t realize how much I would spend if I ate out all weekend, even with breakfast at home! I think I will be more conscious that this can’t happen every weekend, as I’m trying very hard to pay down my debt.”</p>

<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-wedding-guest-dresses-summer"">""Wedding season”</a> is often associated with summer, but the most popular months to say “I do” <a href=""https://www.theknot.com/content/is-there-an-off-season-for-weddings"">actually fall later in the year. </a>Maybe it’s the foliage or the welcome relief from the heat, but fall weddings are definitely a <em>thing</em>. While the colorful leaves make for stunning wedding photos, finding fall wedding guest dresses can be tricky. The goal: something elevated, seasonally appropriate, and comfortable enough to carry you through hours of celebrating (and dancing).<br /><br />Ahead, we’ve rounded up 24 statement-making fall wedding guest dresses that work for dipping temperatures (think: maxi lengths, long sleeves, and rich fabrics) and every kind of venue (think: luxe halls, breweries, or lakeside). Expect autumnal florals, sweet puff sleeves, and slinky satin picks. Whether you need an elegant gown for a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-tie-wedding-guest-dress"">black-tie affair</a> or are craving a trendy <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/arrange-asos-brand-plus-size-review"">plus-size dress</a> for a casual ceremony, your perfect look is just a click away.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

<p>I’ll be honest: I’ve never been a big fan of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hair-mask-conditioner-trend"">hair masks</a>. For starters, I don’t have the patience to wait for a mask to sit for anywhere from five to 15 minutes. But mostly, I’ve never found one that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fable-and-mane-shine-hair-mask-review"">hydrates my hair</a> without weighing it down. I have extremely thick, long hair that is prone to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-conditioners-for-frizzy-hair"">frizz</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/09/10655215/dyson-supersonic-flyaway-attachment-review"">flyaways</a>, and I rely on hair oil and dry oil mists to help add shine and moisture. But when <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/igk-mistress-hydrating-hair-balm-review"">IGK</a> — one of my most <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/smoky-brunette-hair-color-trend"">tried-and-true hair brands</a> —announced a limited-edition version of its <a href=""https://www.igkhair.com/products/antisocial-dry-hair-mask?pr_prod_strat=jac&amp;pr_rec_id=d095e4954&amp;pr_rec_pid=7125454651436&amp;pr_ref_pid=7903988809772&amp;pr_seq=uniform"">Antisocial Dry Hair Mask</a>, I was immediately intrigued.</p>



<p>A <em>dry</em> hair mask? Sounds like a beauty juxtaposition to me — but I’ll admit that the concept was genius: Weightless, shine-boosting hydration that works overnight? Sign me up.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/antisocial-midnight-silk-mask-P517733"">Antisocial Midnight Silk Dry Hair Mask</a>, $38</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11934808.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Taking inspiration from another overnight beauty sleep MVP — <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/silk-pillowcase-hair-skin-benefits"">silk pillowcases</a> — <a href=""https://www.igkhair.com/products/antisocial-midnight-silk-time-release-bond-building-dry-mask"">IGK’s Midnight Silk</a> version of Antisocial features extra-special packaging and a light, subtly sweet scent. Per the instructions, I tried it on clean, dry hair and brushed it throughout before securing in a loose braid – my preferred bedtime hairstyle. The next morning, I woke up with loose waves and touchably soft, smooth hair. I still had some rogue flyaways at the top — nothing I couldn’t fix with a little hairspray — and my hair looked visibly shinier and my highlights brighter, somehow. And best of all, I loved not having to rinse anything out — just spray, brush, and wake up to silky, shiny hair.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11935082.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Ingredients like vegan silk protein (another nod to the name), plus a bond-building peptide complex mean that this stuff doesn’t just hydrate on a surface level to temporarily tame frizz; with continued use (including mid-day refreshes or even on second-day hair), I actually could see and feel a difference in my hair health. </p>



<p>Much like skincare, the best hair care is the kind you’ll actually use regularly — and now that I no longer have to deal with the inconvenience and heaviness of traditional hair masks, taking care of my length has never been easier. (Also, I finally get the hype surrounding Antisocial — she’s sold out eight times ever since launching. NBD!) At $38, it’s a luxury product, but the rare one that is worth every penny, in my opinion. (Also, I have a <em>lot</em> of hair, and I’m still on my first one after nearly a month of use.) Antisocial may be her name, but this is one beauty product I’m happily sharing with anyone and everyone.</p>

<p>This past summer, I was presented with an amazing opportunity to tour New York’s Garment District, and what I saw as a Black creative wasn’t just beautiful or innovative — it was affirming. I witnessed other Black creatives who are not only at the forefront of technological advancement, but using that to completely reshape the fashion landscape. </p>



<p>Our first stop was the New York Embroidery Studio — a nondescript building from the outside, but on the inside, houses one of the most ​​​​​advanced ​​​​​tools ​​​​​in ​​​​​fashion ​​​​​tech ​​​​​right ​​​​​now: the ​​​​​Stratasys ​​​​​J850, ​​​​​a ​​​​​​printer ​​​​​that ​​​​​uses ​​​​​lenticular ​​​​​printing, ​​​​​or ​​​​​a ​​​​​type ​​​​​of ​​​​​3D ​​​​​printing, ​​​​​to ​​​​​apply ​​​​​holographic, ​​​​​raised, ​​​​​or ​​​​​shifting ​​​​​visuals ​​​​​directly ​​​​​onto ​​​​​fabric (think ​​​​​layers, ​​​​​gradient, ​​​​​photo ​​​​​realism, ​​​​​or ​​​​​textures ​​​​​that ​​​​​appear ​​​​​to ​​​​​move ​​​​​when ​​​​​you ​​​​​do). This is ​​​​​how ​​​​​sketches ​​​​​become ​​​​​sculpture, ​​​​​and ​​​​​fabric ​​​​​becomes ​​​​​an ​​​​​engaging ​​​​​and ​​​​​fun interactive ​​​​​experience.</p>



<p>This ​​​​​tour, which was led by Lenese Griffin, a seasoned apparel production manager with a wealth of experience in product development, opened my eyes to the massive, complicated world of fashion. The industry is so much more than aesthetics and seasonal trends — it’s an intricate system that’s evolving into something ​​​​​more ​​​​​intelligent, inclusive, ​​​​​immersive, ​​​​​and ​​​​​intentional. ​​​​​And we’re at the intersection ​​​​​between ​​​​​high ​​​​​design ​​​​​and ​​​​​high ​​​​​tech, ​​​​​and ​​​​​Black ​​​​​designers ​​​​​like ​​​​​LaQuan ​​​​​Smith, ​​​​​Anifa ​​​​​Mvuemba, ​​​​​and ​​​​​Madison ​​​​​Maxey ​​​​​are ​​​​​leading ​​​​​some ​​​​​of ​​​​​the ​​​​​boldest ​​​​​work ​​​​​in ​​​​​that ​​​​​space. ​​​​​</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>LaQuan Smith</h2>



<p><a href=""https://laquansmith.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">LaQuan ​Smith</a>’s ​spring/summer 2025 ​show ​featured ​a ​sleepwear ​capsule “Lucid Dream,” ​co-created ​with ​Samsung, that drew design inspiration from the sleekness of the ​Galaxy ​Ring. ​The ​sleepwear ​arrived ​in ​vivid ​chartreuse ​silk ​organza and it served as a contrast against other designs, like ​trench ​coats ​made ​of ​a ​new ​material ​Smith ​calls ​“transparent ​horse,” ​made ​by ​his ​Italian ​mills. He described the look as perfect for when “a ​woman, ​on ​a ​rainy ​night, ​goes ​to ​her ​man’s ​house ​to ​have ​makeup ​sex.” It’s sensual luxury with a futuristic edge. </p>



<p>The New York-based designer used “AI Atelier” on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, where AI tools like sketch-to-image helped with the design process, and “Now Brief,” which supported things like organizing fabrics, scheduling fittings, and making communication with his team more efficient. </p>



<h2>Anifa Mvuemba </h2>



<p>Congolese born and DMV-based Anifa Mvuemba is the designer behind <a href=""https://hanifa.co/?srsltid=AfmBOopY2D4vaIZ-GhEgvdx1nxq3Sa7oHvPrTZDNcdsW6bG5g0pqANK_"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hanifa</a>, a brand that draws on her cultural background, resulting in bold silhouettes and inclusive sizing. In May 2020, she presented Pink Label Congo, a collection that honored her Congolese roots while raising awareness about issues like the exploitation that’s tied to coltan mining, as a digital runway show using invisible 3D avatars on Instagram Live. It was immediately celebrated for its innovation and cultural commentary, proving that technology can be used to amplify a message and unite the community instead of diluting it. </p>



<p>Since then, Hanifa has continued to evolve, balancing innovation with intentional craft. Mvuemba uses digital tools, like CLO, Procreate, and Blender in her design process, reducing waste while refining her vision of how clothes should move on the body. Her philosophy is clear: Fashion should be inclusive, technologically forward, and deeply connected to heritage. </p>



<h2>Madison Maxey </h2>



<p>Imagine buying a jacket that not only keeps you warm, but also senses how often you wear it, keeps track of how many times it’s been washed, and even helps a brand understand how its product moves through your life. That’s what <a href=""https://www.loomia.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Loomia</a> is doing right now. The tech — Loomia Electronic Layer (LEL) — is a flexible circuit sheet that bends, sketches, and survives in fabrics while carrying functions such as heating, lighting, or pressure detection. And yes, the layer holds up when stretched or handled; its electrical performance stays stable, unlike older “smart fabrics.” </p>



<p>And the woman behind Loomia is: Madison Maxey, who started it out of a desire to make electronics disappear into clothing, so the fabric does the work without feeling like gear. Before Loomia, she experimented with conductive inks, computational design, and patterning electronics with designers and engineers. LEL is now mostly used in medical, outdoor, automotive, and wellness fields, proving that wearable tech can be something that’s used, lived in, and trusted every day, by everyone. Case in point: A recent collaboration with L.L. Bean, where LEL was sewn or attached inside of outdoor gear to report wear behavior: temperature, wash, count, and usage patterns. The versatility of the technology shows how seamlessly it can be folded into existing brand identities and products. Loomia isn’t just for Loomia —  it’s scalable and transferable, and that’s its real strength.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<p>These designers are writing the next chapter of what fashion looks like. ​​​​​They’re ​​​​​building ​​​​​new ​​​​​systems, ​​​​​new ​​​​​fabrics, ​​​​​new ​​​​​languages, and ​​​​​doing ​​​​​it ​​​​​on ​​​​​their ​​​​​terms. We ​​​​’re ​​​​​entering ​​​​​a ​​​​​new ​​​​​era ​​​​​of ​​​​​fashion, ​​​​​and it ​​​​​values ​​​​​identity, ​​​​​innovation, ​​​​​and ​​​​​equality that leaves an impact — and ​​​​​I ​​​​​can’t ​​​​​wait ​​​​​to ​​​​​see ​​​​​what’s ​​​​​next.</p>

<p>When I received my flights and itinerary for a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/friendship-milestone-anniversary-trip"">besties’ trip</a> to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/digital-nomad-full-time-traveler-chiang-mai-thailand-money-diary"">Thailand</a>, I immediately called my other half to go over the plan. As <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/05/232968/long-distance-friendship-tips"">long-distance BFFs</a>, we wanted to make every moment together count. On the phone, we revised the schedule, slotting in activities during our six-hour layover at Changi Airport in Singapore and any free days we had in <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expedia.com%2FHotel-Search%3Fdestination%3DKoh%2520Samui%252C%2520Surat%2520Thani%2520Province%252C%2520Thailand%26regionId%3D6035013%26latLong%3D9.501394%252C99.995619%26flexibility%3D0_DAY%26d1%3D2025-10-08%26startDate%3D2025-10-08%26d2%3D2025-10-09%26endDate%3D2025-10-09%26adults%3D2%26rooms%3D1%26pwaDialog%3Dfee-inclusive-pricing-sheet"">Koh Samui</a>, an island on the southeastern coastline of the Gulf of Thailand that Expedia recently named “Best for Affordable Luxury” on its <a href=""https://www.expedia.com/see/islandhotlist"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">2025 Island Hot List</a>. It was the first time either of us was headed to Asia, and we wanted to see as much as we could and do as much as possible. We had five days — 120 hours — and we were determined not to waste a single minute.</p>



<p>But as the first several hours of our adventure together failed to go according to plan, I began to learn an important lesson about time: that the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/03/10332829/why-does-time-feel-weird-covid-pandemic"">idea of time</a> as something we can structure and control is an illusion, mostly because time, itself, doesn’t actually exist in the way I thought it did.</p>



<p><strong>Day 1 — We Can’t Control Time</strong></p>



<p>Twenty-four hours into our travels, when we made it from Orlando, to San Francisco, to Changi Airport — where we had scheduled a free tour of the city, waterfall gazing at the Rain Vortex, a photoshoot at the Sunflower Garden, a playful walk along Canopy Park, and, of course, a meal at the Michelin-starred Kam’s Roast — we ended up adjusting our overambitious schedule by finding a comfortable place to rest before grabbing a quick bite. What felt like an hour somehow turned into five, and we ultimately jetted to our Bangkok Airways flight to Koh Samui without crossing off a single item from the list we’d meticulously built.</p>



<p>About an hour and a half later, when we arrived at our final destination, we were still spooked by the mysterious speed of time. But we laughed it off and were determined to return to scheduled programming. It was morningtime in Koh Samui, and we were ready to dip into the pale jade waters of Chaweng Beach and take photos in flowy dresses at the jungle-themed Songbird Lounge at our resort, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expedia.com%2FKoh-Samui-Hotels-Anantara-Lawana-Koh-Samui-Resort.h3131654.Hotel-Information%3Fchkin%3D2025-10-08%26chkout%3D2025-10-09%26x_pwa%3D1%26rfrr%3DHSR%26pwa_ts%3D1758721984916%26referrerUrl%3DaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXhwZWRpYS5jb20vSG90ZWwtU2VhcmNo%26useRewards%3Dtrue%26rm1%3Da2%26regionId%3D6035013%26destination%3DKoh%2520Samui%252C%2520Surat%2520Thani%2520Province%252C%2520Thailand%26destType%3DMARKET%26selected%3D3131654%26latLong%3D9.501394%252C99.995619%26sort%3DRECOMMENDED%26top_dp%3D268%26top_cur%3DUSD%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjwrc7GBhCfARIsAHGcW5VBLzRw9rRHeaCGOunCIQpr2i0CqLaFCoWPea-iuW3yXFOgccIEc5kaAqgwEALw_wcB%26semcid%3DUS.UB.GOOGLE.PT-c-EN.HOTEL%26semdtl%3Da115095931062.b1128773544346.g1kwd-297287725106.e1c.m1Cj0KCQjwrc7GBhCfARIsAHGcW5VBLzRw9rRHeaCGOunCIQpr2i0CqLaFCoWPea-iuW3yXFOgccIEc5kaAqgwEALw_wcB.r155ea443aba8fb20a6b16868a6f0ab3ce1aca4e3140cc92f6afa62889c1fbd11b.c1.j19011784.k1.d1558748078076.h1p.i1.l1.n1.o1.p1.q1.s1anantara%2520lawana%2520koh%2520samui%2520resort.t1.x1.f1.u1.v1.w1%26userIntent%3D%26selectedRoomType%3D448130%26selectedRatePlan%3D382653233%26searchId%3D8e57e978-cc7a-4345-89b8-cd5f1b021a07"">Anantara Lawana Koh Samui</a>, where scenes from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/08/10640659/the-white-lotus-review-the-limits-of-white-self-critique""><em>White Lotus</em></a> Season 3 were filmed. Except my friend’s checked luggage didn’t make it with us. Apparently, her suitcase was stuck somewhere in Singapore and we were told it would be located and delivered to our resort by the end of the day. But by then, we’d have lost the sunlight for the beach and the photos. </p>



<p>Once again, our first few hours in Asia — the precious, never-to-return time — would be “wasted,” or so we thought. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Growing up in the U.S., time often feels like currency, and as a Latina raised in a frugal home, I was taught to not squander anything of value.

<p>Growing up in the U.S., time often feels like currency, and as a Latina raised in a frugal home, I was taught to not squander anything of value. So, like money, I spent my time “wisely:” Every hour had a purpose and every day took me closer to a goal. At the time of my besties’ trip, I had already been feeling like I had mispent my time. That summer, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/solo-midlife-birthday-trip-mexico"">I turned 35 years old</a>, and I realized my life was not where I had thought it would be. Sure, I had crossed most items off of my adulthood to-do list, but I had never been able to scratch off motherhood, and it started to feel like time for this milestone was running out. And unlike cash, there was no way I’d get that currency back. On this trip, I was beginning to feel that anxiety again, the feeling that days spent off schedule were days missed and misused. </p>



<p>When we finally arrived at our resort, anxious and exhausted, my thoughts about time began to shift. In Thailand, time doesn’t necessarily move according to the clock. Things begin when they’re meant to. The focus is more on readiness and less on the actual minute hand. This idea showed up from the moment we stepped into our resort. The concierge staff welcomed us with a smile, walked us over to a large ceremonial gong, and invited us to strike it three times. It was a symbolic way of marking our arrival and the beginning of our stay. But it also made something click: whatever time we’d “lost” stressing about luggage or sleeping through layovers didn’t matter. That time had passed, and in that sense, it no longer existed. And now we had time to do what our bodies actually needed us to: freshen up, relax on the king-sized bed in our villa, and beat jet lag so we could actually enjoy the days ahead of us.</p>



<p><strong>Day 2 — We All Experience Time Differently</strong></p>



<p>On the second day, once my friend finally had her suitcase of essentials, we jumped back into our itinerary, which was still patiently waiting for us. It didn’t matter which day we did what, just that we were doing it. Over breakfast at Ocean Kiss, the resort’s breezy beachfront buffet restaurant, we had fresh watermelon juice, Thai iced coffee, tropical fruit, noodles, pastries, and made-to-order omelets. Afterwards, we wandered the resort for some light cardio, passing koi ponds, checking out the tree house restaurant, <a href=""https://www.treetopsrestaurantsamui.com/"">Tree Tops,</a> we’d booked for later in the week, and stumbling into a rooftop boxing gym with the most stunning island views. Back at our villa, we cooled off in our private pool, enjoying deep catch-ups and hilarious photoshoots. That evening, we also watched a traditional Thai light show on the beach. The performer, barefoot and dressed in a bright red and gold costume, danced ram Thai, a slow movement that’s hundreds of years old and was originally performed in royal courts and religious ceremonies.</p>



<p>That night, I noticed my phone said the year was 2568. The month and day were correct, but the year was 543 years ahead. I was confused, so, naturally, I looked into it. I learned that Thailand uses the Buddhist calendar, which is five centuries ahead of the Gregorian calendar most of the world uses. What we call 2025 is 2568 in Thailand. That’s because their year zero is tied to the death of the Buddha rather than the birth of Christ. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Time isn’t fixed. It’s cultural and, thus, made up.

<p>While I joked to my family back home that I was both 12 hours ahead of them and hundreds of years in the future, it also reminded me that time isn’t fixed. It’s cultural and, thus, made up. We mark it based on what we value, whether that’s religious figures, harvest seasons, fiscal years, school schedules, or birthdays. But it’s still just a framework. The calendar we use, the milestones we aim for, and the pace we’re told to keep aren’t universal. It’s just one way to move through life, meaning there must also be other ways to do so. </p>



<p><strong>Day 3 — Time Is Cyclical, Not Linear, So It Can’t Run Out</strong></p>



<p>The next morning, we went on a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expedia.com%2Fthings-to-do%2Fnull.a1460577.detalles-actividades%3Frid%3D6307515%26location%3DMuelle%2520Haad%2520Rin%26swp%3Doff%26startDate%3D2025-09-24%26endDate%3D2025-10-08"">“Best of Samui” city tour</a> with a local guide who drove us to several cultural and spiritual sites around the island. Our first stop was Wat Plai Laem, a colorful, modern temple that blends Thai, Chinese, and Hindu iconography. We saw a striking statue of Guanyin, the 18-armed goddess of compassion; a Laughing Buddha representing abundance and joy; and intricate depictions of Hindu deities like Ganesha, the remover of obstacles.</p>



<p>After that, we headed to Wat Phra Yai, better known as the Big Buddha Temple. We climbed 73 steps to reach the massive seated Buddha, which stands about 40 feet tall and overlooks the island from a raised platform. After paying our respects, praying, and taking in the gold-plated statue surrounded by lotus blossoms and prayer bells, our guide struck up a conversation about the Thai calendar, noting that it was the year 2568 and that, for many Thai people, especially practicing Buddhists, time is seen as cyclical instead of linear. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11935020.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>He explained that in Western culture, time is often thought of as a straight line: you’re born, you grow up, you hit certain milestones, and eventually you die. It’s forward-moving and goal-oriented. But in Thai Buddhism, time isn’t something you race through. It moves in cycles: life, death, rebirth, and spiritual progress. Basically, you don’t have to accomplish everything in one lifetime, so there’s no sense of being “too late” or “running out of time.” There’s just where you are now and where you’re headed, eventually. As two women in our mid-30s who had been feeling the pressure of time, this concept felt both comforting and freeing.</p>



<p>Next, we visited Hin Ta and Hin Yai Rocks, famous for looking like male and female genitalia (yes, really). It was a quick stop and a very popular photo op, but our guide told us that the rocks had taken on these shapes naturally and slowly by wind and sea erosion over thousands of years. It was another reminder that time, when left alone, unrushed, and without a deadline, creates its own beautiful and worthy story. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“In Thai Buddhism, time isn’t something you race through. It moves in cycles: life, death, rebirth, and spiritual progress. Basically, you don’t have to accomplish everything in one lifetime, so there’s no sense of being ‘too late’ or ‘running out of time.'”</p><cite>raquel reichard</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Finally, our last stop was Wat Khunaram, where the body of a mummified monk named Loung Pordaeng is displayed in the same seated meditation position he died in decades ago. His body has barely decayed, and his hair and teeth are still intact. For Buddhists, death isn’t an endpoint. It’s just another phase. The emphasis is on how you live rather than on how long you lived. According to our guide, the monk had told his followers that if his body remained preserved, it would be a sign that he had reached enlightenment, the Buddhist state of Nirvana, where suffering ends and the cycle of rebirth breaks, leaving behind only clarity, compassion, and spiritual liberation. I appreciated seeing death presented as something still unfolding rather than an end.</p>



<p><strong>Day 4 — I Am Exactly Where I Need To Be at This Time in My Life</strong></p>



<p>The next day, we learned that the full-day snorkeling trip we had planned for Koh Tao and Koh Nangyuan had been canceled due to an incoming storm. Normally, this would’ve felt like a wasted day. But by then, after three days in Thailand both learning and witnessing how differently time is experienced, I didn’t panic. Instead, my friend and I had a long breakfast and then walked down to Chaweng Beach. </p>



<p>She hiked along the rocks, and I stayed behind to meditate in the still waters. Around me, tourists enjoyed each other’s company: a British family of three played “Marco Polo” and a large group of Arab relatives laughed during what seemed like a family reunion. At one point, I noticed a little girl drifting too far into the water and waded in to carry her back to her father. He thanked me for being at the “right place at the right time.” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“For most of my life, I’ve treated time like something to be managed, maximized, and spent. But moments like that reminded me that I’m always exactly where I need to be, even when things don’t go as planned, maybe especially then.”</p><cite>raquel reichard</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>There was that word again. For most of my life, I’ve treated time like something to be managed, maximized, and spent. But moments like that reminded me that I’m always exactly where I need to be, even when things don’t go as planned, maybe especially then. If something doesn’t happen when I thought it would — whether it’s a trip, a relationship, or a phase of life — it’s not that time is running out but that it just wasn’t time yet. </p>



<p><strong>Day 5 — Time Is Meant to Be Experienced, Not Rushed Through</strong></p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11935022.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>On our last day, my friend and I participated in <a href=""https://www.expedia.com/things-to-do/thai-cooking-class-organic-micro-farm-experience-farm-to-table-since-2015.a2595376.activity-details?location=Koh+Samui%2C+Surat+Thani+Province%2C+Thailand&amp;startDate=2025-09-24&amp;endDate=2025-10-08&amp;rid=6035013&amp;AID=11552045&amp;PID=100062354&amp;SID=30283X879131X958c566ec844ad51a37b52f31bfc80c3&amp;URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expedia.com%2Fthings-to-do%2Fthai-cooking-class-organic-micro-farm-experience-farm-to-table-since-2015.a2595376.activity-details%3Flocation%3DKoh%2520Samui%2C%2520Surat%2520Thani%2520Province%2C%2520Thailand%26startDate%3D2025-09-24%26endDate%3D2025-10-08%26rid%3D6035013&amp;affcid=network.cj.100062354&amp;cjevent=78eb5893995911f0803c00950a82b82c&amp;affdtl=CJ.78eb5893995911f0803c00950a82b82c.11552045.30283X879131X958c566ec844ad51a37b52f31bfc80c3&amp;button_referral_source=other"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chef Lat’s Island Organic Farm Thai Cooking Class</a>, the first farm-to-table cooking class on Koh Samui. The four-hour experience started with a guided tour of Chef Lat’s lush organic micro‑farm, where she cultivates more than 70 varieties of Thai herbs, vegetables, and fruits, including galangal, kaffir lime, lemongrass, and moringa. With freshly picked produce in hand, we moved to our stations in the open‑air Thai cookery kitchen and got to work. We started with a refreshing butterfly pea flower herbal drink, followed by four classic Thai dishes: Pad Thai Prawn, Tom Yum Prawn, Penang Chicken, and Som Tum (papaya salad).</p>



<p>Even in the comically high-pressure kitchen, there was another lesson about time. As Chef Lat reminded us, we wouldn’t rush the layering of flavors in the curry or speed up the pounding of herbs in the mortar and pestle. Thai cooking, like much of Thai life, demands time and presence. It’s not about finishing quickly but rather about being deliberate, staying focused, and honoring each step in the process. Just like in life, slowness isn’t inefficiency. It’s care, presence, and intention. It’s less about squeezing as much as we can into an hour and more about actually being in the hour.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“If time is relative, then it’s not absolute. And if it’s not absolute, then it can’t really run out.”</p><cite>raquel reichard</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>With that, my bestie and I returned to our resort for a 60-minute full-body massage followed by a 30-minute Indian head massage. We locked our phones in a safe, leaving the 24-hour clock behind with them. A gong was struck when we began and again when we were finished. But for the time in between — when our therapists used warm coconut oil to smooth out the tension in our shoulders, backs, and scalps — we were fully present.</p>



<p>I grew up believing time was linear, fixed, and constantly slipping away. It was something I had to beat, never fall behind from, or catch up to. But Thailand reminded me that time is a human invention. It’s experienced differently across cultures and even across seasons of life. But if time is relative, then it’s not absolute. And if it’s not absolute, then it can’t really run out. With that, maybe I haven’t missed anything. Maybe I’m not behind at all. Maybe, like everything else on this trip, I can trust that I will arrive exactly when I’m meant to.</p>

<p>When the person <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dating-coach-single-women-find-love-relationship"">I’d been dating</a> for a few months told me that he was getting back together with his ex-girlfriend, effectively <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/situationships-dating-fulfilling-2"">ending our situationship</a>, I went a bit light-headed. It did not help that it was at my favorite bar on a Saturday night, I hadn’t had much sleep and we’d had six double G&amp;Ts between us. Passersby stubbed their cigarettes out in the ashtray on our table as he emphasized how gutted he was because I had been “so much fun<em>“</em>. He told me I was so cool, so pretty, so smart, so funny. “You’re sexy,” he added for good measure, “I really rate you.” To my brain, the subtext was obnoxiously clear: <em>I like fucking you</em> <em>but I don’t like YOU</em>. If the ground had split in two and swallowed me up in that exact moment, I would’ve been thankful. </p>



<p>After I broke up with my boyfriend of four and a half years, I convinced myself that nothing could rival that discomfort, especially not something that by its very nature was intended to be fleeting. Somehow, this pain eclipsed it. With the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10772596/sad-girl-autumn-adele-taylor-swift-mitski"">relationship breakup</a>, I felt an ache for almost a year. It would flare occasionally. This pain was red-hot and restless. I tried my best to put it aside but it was constantly on my mind, even days later. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>The spontaneous, undefined nature of a situationship can mean that you go quickly from speaking to each other every day to being unfollowed, ghosted or blocked without another word.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>When I went out onto the balcony of my new apartment, I found myself glaring at the limp cheese plant he’d bought me and debating whether to toss it onto the driveway below. It all came to a head a week later, when my flatmate chirpily relayed the details of her own similar situationship and to my surprise (and embarrassment) I burst into tears – howling, hyperventilating, headache-inducing tears. I was mortified. I knew I didn’t love this person, even care for them the way I’d cared for my ex, so how could this hurt so much? The next day I relayed my confusion to my best friend, who nodded understandingly and said: “I’ve seen a TikTok about this.”</p>



<p>In the <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@robbiesmoonmusic/video/7155899687747489070?is_from_webapp=v1&amp;item_id=7155899687747489070&amp;web_id=7158040017917560326"">TikTok in question</a>, a woman asks the camera if anyone can explain why the breakdown of her three-month situationship hurt more than getting out of her five-year relationship. It was a question that seemed to come up time and time again, in comment sections, Twitter threads and conversations among friends. I was reassured to know it wasn’t quite the phenomenon I first thought it was but, like many others, I was desperate to know the answer.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/oloni/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Oloni, sex and relationships expert</a> and author of <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/oloni-the-big-o-talking-about-masturbation"">The Big O</a>, </em>explains that the reason why a situationship breakup can hurt more than a relationship breakup is because usually, one person doesn’t see it coming. “With situationships, it’s fun, it’s full of fireworks – you never really know what’s gonna come from it,” she says. “You never know if it’s gonna turn into a relationship or if it’s just something that’s for the now. With relationships, you kind of know where it’s heading.” The unpredictability is part of the situationship appeal. Oloni explains that with a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/getting-comfortable-in-relationship"">long-term relationship</a>, typically there is an awareness, even if it’s subconscious, when it’s coming to an end. There could be a discussion (or several) before the breakup actually happens. You might even get back together several times before you definitively call it quits. “Because you have that preparation, it doesn’t hurt as much… It’s a bit more of a slower burn.” </p>



<p>The spontaneous, undefined nature of a situationship can mean that you go quickly from speaking to each other every day to being unfollowed, ghosted or blocked without another word. Spotify Blend playlist removed; iMessage thread deleted. There’s a natural desire to know exactly why they didn’t choose you, what you did wrong and what you could’ve done better. Simultaneously, there is a belief that you aren’t within your rights to ask because that person was never officially yours. “I feel like we’re in this culture, if I can’t call you my boyfriend or girlfriend, you don’t really have a right to question my feelings or question my authenticity or question where I [saw] this relationship going,” says Oloni. </p>



<p>After he broke the news, the person I was in a situationship with asked tentatively if I had any questions but I, worried about appearing too bothered (pedantic, crazy even), especially in a public setting, said no. In reality I had several. He eventually admitted that he had been seeing his ex-girlfriend the whole time he was seeing me. Was I simply a placeholder until she was ready to take him back? Did he ever actually like me? Without warning and without clarification, the dissolution of the situationship fed into my insecurities. Even though he insisted that it was nothing to do with me, I still had a lurking feeling that my actions had caused this. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>For people who lack a secure attachment style, a situationship breakup can feel especially painful because it confirms a fear that is developed during early childhood: that someone they care about might unexpectedly one day abandon them, or cannot be depended on.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>There are ways to try and mitigate this kind of spiralling, which is all too common when it feels like any semblance of control has been yanked from our hands. “I suggest creating a pie chart. What are all the reasons why it hasn’t worked out?” says clinical psychologist <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/counselling/lola-olukotun-london-eng/926883"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dr Omolola Olukotun</a>. “People probably put 80% of themselves in there, [the rest] might be because something hasn’t worked out for some other reason. Then we would say take yourself out and actually, by taking themselves out, they can think of more reasons why it might have ended.”</p>



<p>Dr Olukotun also explains that for people who lack a secure <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dating-anxious-avoidant-attachment-style-switch"">attachment style</a>, a situationship breakup can feel especially painful because it confirms a fear that is developed during early childhood: that someone they care about might unexpectedly one day abandon them, or cannot be depended on. Long-term relationships that were once secure don’t typically evoke the same level of anxiety. “If you were with someone for a longer time and you’ve both identified that I am yours and you are mine, [breaking up] doesn’t activate that sense of abandonment or the sense of fear of dependence per se.” </p>



<p>Having an attachment style that is not secure can mean you are instinctively attracted to the insecure nature of a situationship and the person who comes with it, even if it leaves us perpetually anxious. Dr Olukotun encourages people who find themselves in these situationships to examine what makes them feel safe and comfortable. “So working out actually, what do I want? And is the person I keep trying to go for, do they make me feel safe? Or do they remind me of early life experiences?” Once you know what you need to feel comfortable in a situationship, communicate this and establish clear boundaries so that you aren’t taking the situationship further than either of you are prepared for. “Opening up [outside of these established boundaries] can run the risk of emotional dependency which is not what a situationship is actually for,” says Dr Olukotun.</p>



<p>For it to stop hurting, I needed to forgive myself for being so upset that it ended. I had to (albeit reluctantly) admit that I had genuinely liked this person and that I had simply not anticipated that he would choose someone else, even though he was entitled to do so. I had to speak to my own therapist about it, get into my best friend’s bed and cry about it, write about it. </p>



<p>Are situationships always bad, relationships always good? No. A situationship can be a lot of fun and allow you to discover what you can tolerate in a potential partner or relationship. But it’s important to remember that while you might not want to label it a ‘real’ relationship, the people who enter it are real and so are the emotions that come with them. </p>

<p><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-movie"">The Summer I Turned Pretty</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-movie""> </a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-movie"">(TSITP)</a></em> fever has swept across the world, and viewers of all ages are incredibly <em>invested</em> in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/09/11934126/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-ending"">Jenny Han’s YA drama</a>. There’s something about a combination of dreamy summer Cousins Beach and extreme teenage angst that becomes irresistible. But why do fictional characters draw us in so much? For some people, they may not understand why fans get to the point where they’re fighting over pomegranate margaritas about whether <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-conrad-jeremiah"">Team Conrad or Team Jeremiah</a> is the right choice <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/tsitp-belly-engagement-ring-wedding-trends"">for Belly</a>.</p>



<p>Carly Dober, principal psychologist at <a href=""https://enrichinglivespsychology.com.au/about"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Enriching Lives Psychology</a>, tells <em>Refinery29 Australia</em> that teenage stories can evoke emotions that we love to cling to. “Most people can clearly recall their teenage years where the highs were very high and the lows were very low due to the hormonal peaks and troughs of adolescence and early adulthood,” Dober says. “It also makes us feel nostalgic for when things felt easier, as for some, retrospectively, their lives became far more complex in their adult years.”</p>



<p>The love triangle and heavily character-driven plot of <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em> also prove addictive, as fans drink up the drama and intrigue. “A love triangle [may leave] us deeply curious and rooting for particular people. Often, people find that who they are rooting for in the love triangle may change throughout a series,” Dober notes. “People can become heavily invested in characters, their stories, and what this represents to them. Maybe someone has been in the character’s shoes before, and we also align our identities with how we want to be seen, and what traits or behaviours we find permissible.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>We also align our identities wtih how we want to be seen, and what traits or behaviours we find permissible.</p><cite>Carly Dober, Psychologist</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Karen-Dill-Shackleford, PhD, a media psychologist based in Santa Barbara, CA, also says it’s natural to find these characters important. She explains that because storytelling is a way to touch on ideas that are important to us, connecting to a story and its characters is important — and often, we might even feel more empathy for a story than we do for things and people in our daily lives.</p>



<p>Dr. Dill-Shackleford describes our relationships to characters as parasocial relationships, or one-sided relationships that we have with the media that we consume. Even if a character can’t talk back to you or otherwise engage with you, it makes sense that if you get home at night and spend an hour or two (or more, we don’t judge) watching a TV show, you might get really attached to them because they bring you joy or cheer you up after a rough day. And feeling so much affection for these characters could be a sign that you’re capable of a lot of empathy. “You have to engage in a real human way in order to feel that connection,” Dr. Dill-Shackleford says. “That’s probably a sign that you are capable of certain social things that you are willing to let yourself go and really feel something in the story.”</p>



<p>There’s not a lot of hard science out there to explain why some people tend to be incredibly passionate fans while others are more casual (i.e., <em>Westworld</em> Reddit theorists vs. people who prefer to just watch the show and let it unfold), but Debra Kissen, PhD, a member of the <a href=""https://adaa.org/"">Anxiety and Depression Association of America</a>, says it might have something to do with how deeply we probe into things in our lives in <em>general</em>.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>You have to engage in a real human way in order to feel that connection.</p><cite>Karen Dill-Shackleford, PhD</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“People who have more of a tendency to dive deep into things might have more of a tendency to be specialists and dive deep while others take more of a wide view,” she says. “Part of that would then show up in <em>anything</em> you do — you do it fully and thoroughly.” But even if you’re not the all-or-nothing type, Dr. Dill-Shackleford says that characters are often avatars for us, and we let ourselves feel feelings through them even if we can’t relate to <em>everything</em> they’re going through.</p>



<p>That attachment and parasocial relationship can also happen with celebrities, who, in a way, are arguably fictional characters to us: We know the image they present in public, which may or may not 100% align with who they really are, and we guess at the rest. “[With] someone who you’ve followed over a career or long periods of your life, you <em>do</em> feel like you know them,” Dr. Dill-Shackleford says. “You see them in these intimate situations and they’re probably already a beautiful person because they’re an actor, and they’re compelling.”</p>



<p>And, well, the power of attraction is strong. “You can’t underestimate the fact that these stars are very attractive,” she adds. “Most people, unless you live in Hollywood or something, you don’t see that level of physical attractiveness. Like Chris Hemsworth, he’s like a <em>god</em>. So of course it’s a biological cue to us, we’re supposed to find someone to mate with, and it’s a message to us that this person is really valuable because they’re that attractive.”</p>



<p>So it’s normal to be extremely attached to a fictional character or celebrity, so long as it doesn’t become an obsession that takes over your life. If, say, you spend so long thinking about Chris Hemsworth that you’re not dating anyone else because of that attraction, that’s when it might be unhealthy. For the most part, though, Dr. Dill-Shackleford says that most people probably aren’t obsessed to that degree.</p>

<p><em>Welcome to</em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/money-diary""><em> </em>Money Diaries</a><em> where we are tackling the ever-present taboo that is money. We’re asking real people how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period — and we’re tracking every last dollar.<br /><br />Today: a freelance writer who is currently unemployed and who spends some of her money this week on a bunch of flights within Europe at one time.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Editor’s Note:</em></strong><em> Prices converted from GBP to USD; conversion rates correct at time of writing.</em></p>



<p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Freelance writer (formerly a social media manager).<br /><strong>Industry:</strong> Media<br /><strong>Age:</strong> 30<br /><strong>Location:</strong> Portland, Oregon<br /><strong>Salary:</strong> $0 (previously $74,649). My maximum amount payable on unemployment is $13,104.<br /><strong>Joint Income/Financial Setup:</strong> I do not have a joint income, but my long-distance boyfriend T. does support me with little things when needed, such as Uber rides, gym memberships, and groceries. This has worked for us. He is a generous partner, especially when I lost my main source of income. I know he can pick up the slack and is happy to do so.<br /><strong>Assets:</strong> I have two high-yield savings accounts. One has $26,637 and the other has $64,218. I also have a brokerage account that fluctuates but is currently roughly $3,000, a Roth IRA ($6,061), a rollover 401(k) ($34,829), and an HSA ($1,258). I contribute to the emergency fund when possible and don’t fully touch all of my unemployment money, moving $100 to my higher savings account. When I got laid off in June, I took all the steps necessary to go through my subscriptions and any unnecessary spending.<br /><strong>Debt:</strong> $1,073 (credit card); $7,539 (student loan). <br /><strong>Paycheck Amount (Weekly):</strong> $453 net on unemployment (previously $1,751 net, biweekly).<br /><strong>Pronouns:</strong> She/her<br /><br /><strong>Monthly Expenses<br /><br />Housing Costs:</strong> $935. I rent a one-bedroom in a duplex. I don’t have any roommates.<br /><strong>Loan Payments:</strong> $91.35 for student loans. I don’t have a car or any car payments. <br /><strong>Everything Else: </strong>When I got laid off, my boyfriend and I went through all my expenses and shifted as much as possible to what he could cover or what we could share. I also contacted my internet provider and signed up for a cheaper plan ($60 a month). I also paid off the remaining $130 on my phone to lower my monthly bills. I pay $40 a month for my phone bill (I’m on my dad’s phone plan). For utilities, I pay $30-$100 (depending on the season). My landlord pays for water and gas. I also pay $10 for Disney+. When I was working full time, I used to contribute around $600 a month to my savings. Now, I contribute about $100 a month when possible and let it earn interest.</p>



<p><strong>Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?<br /></strong>Growing up, there was always an expectation that I would go to university. While my mom encouraged me to consider the community college down the street, I wanted to study out of state. I had thought about taking a gap year but ultimately went straight to university. Thankfully, I received both housing and academic scholarships, which helped with the costs. My parents split part of the tuition through loans, and I took out a loan to cover my final year. During the pandemic, I paid off more than $4,000 of my student loans, but later requested a refund in hopes that student loan debt would eventually be canceled, so I could use the money for other emergencies I had at the time.<br /><br /><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?<br /></strong>I didn’t really understand the importance of money until high school. My parents never talked much about it, though I could tell we didn’t have a huge amount. We were comfortable. My mom especially didn’t want me to worry and even discouraged me from getting a job as a teenager. We never discussed things like investing or ways to earn money beyond a traditional salary. It wasn’t until I took a finance class in high school that I learned the basics, like how to balance a checkbook and create a budget.<br /><br /><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?<br /></strong>My first job was in a bridal shop when I was 17. I worked as a sales associate, helping girls shop for prom dresses and brides find their wedding gowns. I also stocked dresses and ran errands on the floor. I earned minimum wage, which was about $8.25 an hour in Illinois at the time, and mostly worked weekends since my weekdays were packed with high school commitments. I stayed there through the end of high school. My mom didn’t want me to have a job, but I insisted so I could earn my own money.<br /><br /><strong>Did you worry about money growing up?<br /></strong>I’m sure my parents did struggle, but I didn’t feel it directly. I grew up in a single-parent household and wasn’t the type of kid who asked for much. I noticed it more when I joined activities in high school and needed funds for competition, Secret Santa parties, equipment, etc. My mom always found a way to cover them, but I could tell she was caught off guard at first. That said, I never felt like I didn’t know where my next meal would come from or that I wouldn’t have a place to live. And when it came to big-ticket items, like a phone or computer, she would surprise me on Christmas or my birthday.<br /><br /><strong>Do you worry about money now?<br /></strong>Yes. I’ve always had a survivalist, frugal mentality, and especially so since being laid off. I often struggle with the feeling that I don’t deserve to spend the money I earn. I’ve spent so much time saving that when I need those funds, I don’t want to touch them. Even when I have the money and want to use it to invest in myself or take a vacation, it takes me a long time to decide. I’ve been working on shifting that mindset, reminding myself that money is always available in some form, and that if it’s not, I have an incredible community of friends and family who would support me if I needed it. Freelancing hasn’t helped those nerves — most days, I’m unsure when the next paycheck will arrive. Still, whenever I’ve needed money, it has found its way to me through a project, a friend, or an unexpected check. I do worry about whether I’ll ever be able to retire or if my money will last in the long run. I’m naturally spontaneous and love to disappear off the grid for weeks “for the plot”, but I can just as easily go an entire week spending only $20. Often, spending money feels wrong — what if something happens? — but I know that mindset comes at the expense of enjoying life and truly investing in myself.<br /><br /><strong>At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?<br /></strong>As soon as I graduated from college, I became financially independent. During school, I worked two on-campus jobs, at the library and in security, and used my student loan refunds to help cover living expenses. After graduation, I left home, took an unpaid internship, found a part-time job, and rented my first apartment. From time to time, if money was especially tight, I’d ask my mom or dad for help — never more than $500. I cover all my own bills, but it brings me comfort knowing that even in a worst-case scenario, I’d have a safety net and wouldn’t end up on the street.<br /><br /><strong>Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.<br /></strong>Starting my junior year of high school, my aunt rewarded me with money for every A and B I earned. By the time I graduated from college, I had saved $1,425.38 to use however I wished. Aside from that, I haven’t received any inherited income.</p>



<h3><strong>Day One: Monday</strong></h3>



<p>8 a.m. — I wake up before my alarm and lie in bed a bit. I’m not much of a morning person and have no huge plans for the day. I answer some potential work emails from my bed and finally get up around 10 a.m. I wash my face, brush my teeth, and eat a kiwi in the living room. It’s a sunny day and not as gloomy as the past couple, so I decide to go to a coffee shop to do some more personal work. It’s nice to have a change of scenery, and it makes me more productive. I hop on the local streetcar into downtown Portland.</p>



<p>1 p.m. — I arrive at Never Coffee and order an iced vanilla matcha, settling at one of their outdoor tables. I love that it’s so close to home, and the sunshine makes it the perfect spot to work for a bit. I pull out my laptop to answer emails and create social media posts on Canva about a recent trip to Brazil. With my trip to London coming up in a few days, I spend some time working on an itinerary of things to do there and even make a quick video on UK visa applications to share online. <strong>$5.75</strong></p>



<p>5 p.m. — A friend of mine sends me a text and asks if I want to go to happy hour. I suggest Solo Club, a cocktail bar in northwest Portland. I haven’t eaten much and am starving. I jump on the streetcar to head straight over to the bar. </p>



<p><br />5:30 p.m. — I give my mother a quick call. She’s stuck in Atlanta trying to get back to Chicago. I arrive at Solo Club at the same time as my friend. We find a seat right away outdoors and spend time talking over a non-alcoholic drink and a glass of orange wine. We order a bunch of food to share, from crab Rangoon to Parmesan truffle fries. We split the bill down the middle ($47.50 for my share, including tip) and head next door to Fifty Licks to get some ice cream. I settle on the mini scoop of the lavender salted caramel, which is so delicious, I wish I had gotten a bigger size ($4). I walk with her for about 30 minutes, eating our ice cream, before our walking paths split up, and I continue for another 15 minutes on my own to home. <strong>$51.50</strong></p>



<p>7 p.m. — I arrive home and immediately get into comfortable clothes and turn on the TV to watch <em>Bridgerton</em>, my favorite comfort show, and make myself a passionfruit and lychee tea to wind down for the evening. <br />10 p.m. — My partner T. lives in London and calls me during his morning. We spend time talking about my day and his morning as he is on his way to work, while I brush my teeth, wash my face, and get into bed.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $57.25</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Two: Tuesday</strong></h3>



<p>1 a.m. — I’m still awake thinking about a solo travel idea I want to create for social media. I quickly put it together on Canva. While working, I’m also thinking about my upcoming vacation to Malta and Italy in a few weeks that I’ve had planned for months. I notice that the flight prices have dropped, so I decide to take advantage and book three out of the four flights I need, using my money from my savings, before finally going to sleep. It feels good to check off such an important part of my trip. <strong>$520</strong></p>



<p>9:30 a.m. — I have a bit of a late start, but I jump right out of bed knowing I have a meeting with a public relations firm representative at 10 a.m. to discuss potential client work for stories and content. I’m terrible at eating breakfast, so I fast-forward to lunch, making myself a smoothie and some japchae I picked up from Trader Joe’s. I also take the time to get dressed for the day. <br />10:30 a.m. — The meeting goes really well. The representative is excited to connect me with a client in London, giving me a new opportunity to explore while I’m in town.</p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — I leave the house and head across town for my nail appointment, a 30-minute bus ride to the salon. I get magenta gel nails and a pedicure in preparation for my trip to London in two days. I pick the color to transition slightly into fall tones while still holding on to the last hints of summer. T. is sweet enough to cover the cost as a little self-care treat. <strong>$2.80</strong></p>



<p>3 p.m. — Nails are done, and I’m feeling a little thirsty, so I decide to treat myself. I walk down to Ding Tea and grab a lavender boba. Refreshed, I hop on the bus to head back home. <strong>$6</strong></p>



<p>3:50 p.m. — I get off the bus and make my way to the park on the Portland State University campus. I love spending time here on a sunny day, basking in the warmth while diving into a good book. I have 100 pages left of <em>The Life Impossible</em> by Matt Haig and am determined to make progress before the evening. </p>



<p>5 p.m. — After a couple of hours of reading, I’ve made a dent in the book and now have 60 pages left. Feeling accomplished, I pack up my things and walk back home.</p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — For dinner, I decide to keep things simple and make a margarita pizza from Trader Joe’s. I settle in on the couch, watch <em>Bridgerton</em>, and let the comfort of the show and the warm pizza close out the day.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $528.80</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Three: Wednesday</strong></h3>



<p>10 a.m. — I start my day pretty late, after a night of drifting in and out of sleep, occasionally answering emails with one eye half-open. I finally muster the energy to get out of bed and make a small breakfast of a kiwi and some water with Liquid IV for extra hydration. Feeling a bit more awake, I set up my tripod in the living room, preparing to film a TikTok video I plan to post later in the week.</p>



<p>11:50 a.m. — I leave the house and hop on the streetcar to my Barre3 class. This is the last session on my current membership, which feels a little bittersweet. It’s a signature 45-minute class that always leaves me feeling strong and centered, and I’ve really come to love the routine. Normally, I’d renew my membership, but since I’ll be traveling soon, I decide not to.</p>



<p>1:15 p.m. — Class is over, and I feel grounded and grateful for the morning. I set up my tripod near the gym to film a quick video, taking advantage of the perfect lighting, before walking across the street to my favorite boba shop for a little treat. I go for a vanilla rose boba, savoring each sip as a small reward for the morning’s effort. Before heading home, I make a quick stop at the central library to pick up a new book I’ve been wanting to read, <em>Only for the Week</em> by Natasha Bishop. <strong>$7.50</strong></p>



<p>5 p.m. — My friend comes to pick me up, and we head to Kaya Bar, a Black-owned spot in the city known for its delicious cocktails. We both travel frequently, so it’s rare to get a proper catchup, and tonight feels like the perfect opportunity to reconnect and share months’ worth of life updates. We settle in with shrimp tacos, margaritas, and fries, laughing and talking over the food and drinks. The music sets a great vibe, and it feels good to just be present with a friend after a busy day. <strong>$31.86</strong></p>



<p>7 p.m. — My friend drives me home, and I spend the next little while cleaning up my apartment in preparation for my upcoming trip. I start with the bathroom, then tackle the last bit of laundry I have left. Finally, I vacuum the entire apartment, leaving it feeling refreshed and ready for my absence. </p>



<p>10 p.m. — T. has an early start tomorrow, so we don’t get a chance to talk on the phone. I curl up with my book and read the last 40 pages (verdict: It was good!) before going to sleep. The book explores finding joy in life despite discomfort and embracing change and the uncertainty that life brings, which honestly made it the perfect book for me to read at this point in my life.<br /></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $39.36</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Four: Thursday</strong></h3>



<p>10 a.m. — Wake up to the sound of my phone ringing. One of my best friends was calling to check in on me before my flight to London tonight. She’s also going to London, and we found out we’d be landing at a similar time to each other. After lying around for a little bit, I get up and use the last of the food in the fridge. I make a smoothie and cook some scrambled eggs.</p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — I spend some time checking my suitcase over and over again, taking out some pieces of clothes that I don’t think I’ll get to wear. I also answer some emails and schedule some emails for later in the day. I talk to T. before the flight since he will be asleep while I’m flying. He tells me he will be waiting at the airport to pick emem up.</p>



<p>4:30 p.m. — I call an Uber to come pick me up to head to the Portland International Airport. I’m normally not a person who goes to the airport very early, but I don’t normally check a bag and I don’t want any issues. Plus, traffic has gotten worse in the city, and they were previously doing construction by the airport. I pay for the Uber ($50) but T. generously pays me back for the ride, which makes the start of this trip feel a little easier and more relaxed.</p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — I arrive at the airport and drop off my bags with British Airways. I have about an hour until boarding, so I go upstairs to Loyal Legion, where they have a speakeasy cocktail bar called Aurora. It’s a colorful bar behind a coded door. I order a Silver Ceiling that had a rum blend, passionfruit, and lime. <strong>$17</strong></p>



<p>7:25 p.m. — I arrive at the gate just as boarding starts. I settle into my seat on the plane to London, relieved to finally have a moment to breathe. However, our flight ends up being delayed until 8:25 p.m., and we aren’t given any explanation for the holdup. I end up watching 50 minutes worth of <em>Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy</em> before we finally take off.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $17</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Five: Friday</strong></h3>



<p>1:30 p.m. — I land in London about 30 minutes later than originally planned, which honestly isn’t too bad considering how unpredictable flights can be. As soon as I get off the plane, I brace myself for long lines at customs, but surprisingly, it’s a total breeze, I’m through in what feels like no time. The only real wait comes at baggage claim: My checked bag seems to take forever to appear, and I find myself glancing at my phone and people-watching to pass the time.</p>



<p>2:30 p.m. — As soon as I step out into the arrivals hall, I spot T. waiting for me. We walk toward each other and immediately hug. With my luggage in tow, we make our way outside toward the taxi area so we can call an Uber back to his place. The ride takes us through a mix of London neighborhoods, some new to me and others that stir up memories of the last time I was here. T. covers the Uber, and I just settle back waiting to arrive.</p>



<p>4:45 p.m. — We finally make it to T.’s house, and I can’t wait to shake off the plane. I immediately jump into the shower. We decide to head out to Aldi to pick up some groceries and anything I felt like having for the next few days. The store is fairly quiet, and I wander the aisles, picking out fresh fruit, snacks, and a few treats I’d been craving, including a bottle of wine. T. covers the groceries.</p>



<p>7 p.m. — The jet lag is really hitting me now, and I’m fighting to keep my eyes open. After a long day of travel, grocery shopping, and settling back in, I finally decide there’s no point in resisting. I brush my teeth, slip into comfortable pajamas, and crawl into bed.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $0</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Six: Saturday</strong></h3>



<p>5 a.m. — I wake up super early thanks to jet lag and, no matter how hard I try, I can’t fall back asleep. I scroll on my phone for a bit, check some emails, and let myself just lounge under the covers while the sun slowly brightens the room. Eventually, T. gets up and heads to the kitchen. I can hear the blender going, and soon enough, he brings me a smoothie along with some eggs.</p>



<p>3 p.m. — T. and I head out to All Points East Festival in east London. The sun is shining, and the energy is electric. We decide to take an Uber to the festival grounds in Victoria Park, and T. covers the ride. We immediately get a drink once arriving and head to the VIP area to meet with a few of his friends. As soon as we arrive, we can hear the music pulsing from inside the park, and we’re greeted by a wave of energy. We waste no time and grab a drink right at the entrance. With drinks in hand, we make our way over to the VIP area, where there’s more space to relax, shorter lines, and a slightly calmer vibe. We met up with a few of T.’s friends who are already there, lounging at one of the picnic tables. Everyone is in high spirits, and we catch up quickly before getting pulled right back into the music to listen to Cat Burns.</p>



<p>6:25 p.m. — We can’t find the Casamigos tent that we loved last time, so after wandering around for a bit we give in and head to the regular bar. The lines aren’t too bad, and I decide to grab the drinks this round (two raspberry daiquiris). With drinks in hand, we make our way back into the growing crowd, buzzing with anticipation as everyone waits for Nao’s set to begin. Nao appears, unexpectedly, right in the middle of the crowd, only a few steps away from us, performing her first song. The entire section erupts in excitement, people raising their phones, screaming, singing along. Somehow, in the middle of it all, we catch ourselves on the big screen flashing across the side of the stage. <strong>$23.71</strong></p>



<p>10 p.m. — Back at the main stage, we’re watching Raye perform the most amazing set, but I start getting really, really tired, so we leave the festival in the middle of her set. The air is thick with dust kicked up from thousands of feet, people streaming in every direction, the festival lights glowing in the distance behind us. We walk for what felt like forever, weaving through streets packed with other festivalgoers, before finally finding a spot to call an Uber. T. covers the ride.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $23.71</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Seven: Sunday</strong></h3>



<p>12 p.m. — I wake up feeling a little groggy and spend some time just lying in bed, trying to catch up on the sleep I missed earlier in the week. The sunlight is streaming through the window, and it feels nice to have a slow start for once. T. is already in the kitchen and makes me a smoothie with banana, strawberry, cherry, and coconut water, along with scrambled eggs on the side. We sit at the table, sipping and chatting, not in a rush at all. It’s one of those mornings where the day feels wide open, and I actually have time to enjoy it.</p>



<p>2 p.m. — It’s my first time at Notting Hill Carnival, and I can already feel the buzz from the moment we leave the coffee shop. We grab a couple of iced matchas to keep us refreshed on the way ($5), and I sip mine slowly as we wait for the train. The ride to London Bridge takes about 30 minutes. At London Bridge, we switch to another tube line heading straight for Notting Hill ($5.42). The carriage is packed with people carrying flags, wearing colorful costumes, and blasting music from portable speakers. It’s loud, chaotic, and electric all at once. I can smell the mix of street food from nearby stalls as the train pulls into each station, making my stomach rumble with anticipation. <strong>$10.42</strong></p>



<p>3:45 p.m. — T. and I haven’t eaten all day. We find a Caribbean food stand in the middle of carnival and order jerk chicken. The jerk chicken is quite good, but there isn’t a lot of meat, mostly skin. I also run into one of my best friends and she stays with us while we finish eating. We see a stall that’s selling alcoholic slushies and order a few flavors. I had an orange and passionfruit one with rum. The music is lively and we spend time walking around and dancing to the beat. <strong>$12</strong></p>



<p>7 p.m. — After the festivities start winding down, we begin the trek to the nearest open tube station. The streets are still buzzing with energy, but it’s calmer now compared to earlier. On the way, I spot an Asian market and I head inside, hoping they might have my favorite drink, lychee juice, that I usually can only find overseas. The shelves are stocked, and I grab six cans to stock up for the week. We head back to the tube station and navigate the crowds to head home. By the time we get home, I’m ready to drop into comfortable clothes and unwind. <strong>$11.12</strong></p>



<p>10 p.m. — I realize I have one more flight to book for my upcoming Europe trip. I notice the price has gone up since I last checked, so I scramble to find a deal. I spot the previous fare on a third-party site and decide to snag it before going to bed. Ticket secured, I finally let myself relax. <strong>$130</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $163.54</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>“I think I did pretty well this week. Recording my spending made me really aware of where my money is going and highlighted a few little leaks I hadn’t noticed before. The process was surprisingly fun. It felt like keeping a mini diary of my life choices. In the future, I might be a bit more intentional about categorizing purchases as ‘needs’ versus ‘wants’, and maybe set aside a small daily treat budget so I don’t feel guilty about enjoying myself.”</p>
