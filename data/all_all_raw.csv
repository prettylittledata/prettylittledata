<p>As <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/country/syria"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Syria </a>is emerging from over a decade of conflict at the time of writing, it is an opportunity to rediscover its architectural gems.

<p>Villa Zai is a boutique seaside hotel designed primarily for full-property private group stays. It serves guests who wish to spend time together as a close group, as well as couples seeking a complete wedding venue that supports both the ceremony and reception. With only nine units (eleven bedrooms), the accommodations are intentionally limited to the bride, groom, and their closest family and friends. Additional guests may stay at the owner's nearby sister properties located within a short distance from the main site.</p>",

<h4>AI didn’t create the craft crisis in design — it exposed the technical literacy gap that’s been eroding strategic influence for over a decade.</h4><figure><img alt=""Dylan Field at Figma 2024 Config"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RUyj6Nw2PozgI2F1o8ToIA.avif"" /><figcaption>Dylan Field at Figma 2024 Config (Source: <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/whats-happening-at-config-2024/"">Figma blog</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>At <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/whats-happening-at-config-2024/"">Figma’s Config 2024</a>, CEO Dylan Field stood before 10,000 designers and typed a simple prompt: <em>“A personal portfolio website for a sustainable Middle Earth architect.”</em> Seconds later, a complete UI layout materialized on screen. The crowd watched as Figma’s AI generated wireframes, layouts, and design systems from text prompts.</p><p>Field’s pitch was seductive: “In a world where more software is being created and reimagined because of AI, designing and building products is everyone’s business.”</p><p>Everyone’s business. The democratization promise we’ve heard before — this time powered by GPT-4o and Amazon’s image generators. Some features got huge reactions. The Rename Layers tool earned cheers. But on social media after the event, a different story emerged.</p><p>Designer <a href=""https://sdw.space/figma-ai-and-lost-jobs/"">Sebastiaan de With wrote</a> what many were thinking: “Figma AI will kill most — if not all — of these entry-level design jobs… if someone can simply get that poster (and 10 more like it) generated in a click, people will opt for that most of the time.” The anxiety wasn’t about the technology. It was about what the technology revealed: if AI can do your job with a text prompt, what exactly is your job?</p><p>Then came <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/02/figma-disables-its-ai-design-feature-that-appeared-to-be-ripping-off-apples-weather-app/"">the Apple Weather app incident</a>. Within days of launch, someone noticed Figma’s AI was generating designs that looked suspiciously like Apple’s Weather app. Not inspired by. Actually resembling. Field disabled the feature and admitted the company had rushed to hit a Config deadline. The feature relaunched months later as “First Draft,” with better guardrails.</p><p>But the damage was philosophical, not just technical. The promise of AI democratizing design ran headlong into a paradox nobody wanted to say out loud: these tools don’t make design accessible to everyone. They make design accessible to people who already understand what they’re looking at.</p><h3>The Paradox Nobody Mentions</h3><p>Here’s what actually happened when non-technical users got their hands on AI design tools.</p><p>In May 2025, accessibility expert <a href=""https://adrianroselli.com/2025/05/do-not-publish-your-designs-on-the-web-with-figma-sites.html"">Adrian Roselli tested Figma Sites</a> — the company’s new publish-to-web feature that promised to turn Figma designs into live websites. He ran automated tests on Figma’s own flagship demo sites. The results were brutal: <strong>210 WCAG violations</strong> on one demo site. Another had 107 violations. Images with no alt text. Contrast ratios failing basic accessibility standards. The HTML output was what Roselli called “div soup” — everything rendered as generic container elements, even headings and navigation.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot showing 210 WCAG accessibility violations detected in Figma Sites demo, with critical errors highlighted in red including missing alt text and contrast issues"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*u1udQD4giE_5_j7PMPHSBw.png"" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=""https://adrianroselli.com/2025/05/do-not-publish-your-designs-on-the-web-with-figma-sites.html"">Adrian Roselli</a>’s blogpost on Do Not Publish Your Designs on the Web with Figma Sites…</figcaption></figure><p>The technical implementation was worse. Drop caps were created using background-colored underscores, a technique that belonged in 1974 typewriter manuals, not modern web development. One commenter created a satirical video called “Introducing: Webbed Sites.” Another posted a reaction titled “Figma’s New Horrific DIV Generator.”</p><p>This wasn’t an AI training problem. This was an expertise problem masquerading as a democratization tool. Figma Sites generated technically valid HTML that was utterly inappropriate for actual use. If you don’t know why that’s a problem, the tool won’t help you. If you do know why it’s a problem, you probably wouldn’t use the tool.</p><p>The pattern repeated across every AI design tool that launched in 2024–2025. V0 by Vercel produced code that stopped mid-generation. Users reported the AI losing context and forgetting previous work. Bolt.new earned a 1.5-star rating on Trustpilot, with users reporting they spent over a thousand dollars in tokens just trying to fix code problems. One developer burned through 20 million tokens on a single authentication issue. Critical files went missing. Projects deployed with blank screens.</p><p>Claude Code, despite being one of the more capable AI coding tools, experienced performance degradation so severe that GitHub users reported 30–40% drops in development speed. Tasks that previously took one day required two or three. The most telling detail: Anthropic had to publish an official postmortem admitting infrastructure bugs caused the AI to produce broken code with odd characters.</p><p>And then there was <a href=""https://techstartups.com/2025/05/24/builder-ai-a-microsoft-backed-ai-startup-once-valued-at-1-2-billion-files-for-bankruptcy-is-ai-becoming-another-com-bubble/"">Builder.ai</a> — the cautionary tale everyone should study. Valued at $1.5 billion with backing from Microsoft and Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, Builder.ai promised AI-powered app development. The company employed over 1,500 people and raised $445 million. In May 2025, it filed for bankruptcy. The reason? The “AI” was actually 700 Indian engineers manually coding everything. The Wall Street Journal had exposed this back in 2019, but the company limped along for six more years. Enterprise clients experienced apps crashing under basic user loads. A former employee later joked that the “AI” stood for “Another Indian.”</p><p>The paradox crystalizes: tools marketed as democratization require <em>more</em> technical knowledge than traditional workflows, not less. You need to understand prompt engineering, debug AI-generated output, recognize when the AI is hallucinating, and know enough about technical constraints to evaluate whether what the AI produces is actually feasible.</p><p>We told ourselves AI would level the playing field. Instead, it raised the floor. If you can’t tell the difference between functional code and broken code, between accessible design and inaccessible design, between scalable architecture and technical debt, these tools just let you fail faster.</p><h3>How We Got Here</h3><p>The craft crisis didn’t start with AI. AI just made it impossible to ignore.</p><p>Somewhere in the early 2010s, the design industry made a collective decision: designers don’t need to code. <a href=""https://mralancooper.medium.com/should-designers-code-cde3ef9d6621"">Alan Cooper</a>, the father of Visual Basic and interaction design pioneer, wrote definitively that coding wasn’t necessary for top-notch designers. Design Thinking became the dominant framework, emphasizing empathy and process over technical craft. Design bootcamps proliferated with promises of career changes in six months, explicitly advertising that no coding knowledge was required.</p><p><a href=""https://designlab.com/blog/google-ux-design-certificate-on-coursera-is-it-worth-it"">Google’s UX Certificate</a> on Coursera states clearly: “UX design requires no knowledge of coding.” For $300 and six months at 10 hours per week, you could become a UX designer. Bootcamps charged $10,000 for 12-week programs focused on wireframing, prototyping, and user research — not technical implementation.</p><p>This wasn’t gatekeeping by engineers. This was the design industry telling itself a story about what designers needed to know. The story went like this: designers focus on users, empathy, and problem-solving. Engineers focus on implementation, code, and technical constraints. Clean separation of concerns. Everyone stays in their lane.</p><h3>What we lost wasn’t the ability to code. What we lost was the ability to participate in technical conversations.</h3><p>Understanding why an API limitation makes a feature infeasible. Recognizing when performance constraints should influence design decisions. Knowing enough about technical debt to engage in build-versus-buy discussions. Being able to evaluate whether AI-generated code actually works or just looks like it works.</p><p><a href=""https://rogerwong.me/2025/07/design-talent-crisis"">Roger Wong</a>, analyzing the design talent crisis in 2025, put it bluntly: entry-level designers at Big Tech now represent just 7% of all hires — a 50% drop from 2019. How do designers develop taste, craft, and strategic thinking without doing the foundational work? The industry created a pipeline that produces designers who can talk about empathy but can’t evaluate technical trade-offs.</p><figure><img alt=""Bar chart showing tech industry layoffs from 2020–2024, with peak layoffs of 167,000 in Q1 2023 and 150,000+ layoffs continuing through 2024"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dkXedIBWDnc8-94nlUD-Kw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=""https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-the-major-tech-layoffs-in-2024-so-far/"">https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-the-major-tech-layoffs-in-2024-so-far/</a></figcaption></figure><p>The consequences show up everywhere. <a href=""https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/10-ways-to-improve-design-to-development-handoff/"">UXPin research</a> found that 62% of developers spend significant time redoing designs due to communication breakdowns. Not because designers made bad aesthetic choices. Because designers proposed things that were technically nonsensical, or missed constraints that would have changed the entire approach.</p><p>A designer proposes a feature without understanding that it requires a new API endpoint, which requires backend changes, which requires database migrations, which means a three-month timeline instead of a three-week timeline. The feature gets de-scoped or killed. The designer learns their proposals aren’t strategic input — they’re suggestions engineers will simplify into whatever is actually buildable.</p><p>This happened so many times, in so many companies, that it became the pattern. Designers create mockups. Engineers override them based on technical constraints the designer didn’t know existed. The designer spends days in “alignment meetings” trying to advocate for the user, but can’t speak the technical language needed to actually influence the decision. Business stakeholders step in to make product calls because they can at least understand the technical constraints, even if they don’t understand users.</p><p><a href=""https://designsystems.international/ideas/product-design-is-lost/"">Rune Madsen</a>, in his essay “Product Design Is Lost,” captured this perfectly: designers found themselves “in a place between strategy and implementation, yet they are not fully empowered to influence either.” We’re filling our time with checklists instead of focusing on the very thing that makes designers relevant. We’ve been painted into a corner.</p><p>The industry did this to itself. And we called it progress.</p><h3>Why This Matters Now</h3><p>Here’s the part that makes designers defensive: we lost influence long before AI showed up. AI just exposed the gap.</p><p>The “Great Design Handoff” wasn’t a single event — it was a slow erosion of strategic control. Growth teams took over conversion optimization. Algorithms dictated layout and personalization. Business stakeholders made product decisions. Design leaders found themselves defending the existence of their teams rather than shaping product strategy.</p><p>The evidence is everywhere. <a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/90976682/design-giant-ideo-cuts-a-third-of-staff-and-closes-offices-as-the-era-of-design-thinking-ends"">IDEO</a> — the company that popularized Design Thinking — lost half its headcount between 2020 and 2025. Revenue dropped from $300 million to $100 million. Google laid off over 100 designers in November 2024, cutting some cloud design teams in half. IBM eliminated its chief design officer position entirely. Autodesk cut 1,350 employees in December 2024. Across tech, <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3816662/tech-layoffs-in-2024-a-timeline.html"">150,000+ jobs disappeared in 2024</a> alone.</p><p>But here’s the telling detail: only one major company hired a chief design officer in the second half of 2023. PayPal. That’s it. Executive-level design roles are disappearing across corporate America, and it’s not because AI replaced them. It’s because the roles stopped delivering strategic value.</p><p><a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/91027996/the-big-design-freak-out-a-generation-of-design-leaders-grapple-with-their-future"">Fast Company reported</a> on a March 2024 conference where design leaders from P&amp;G, Ford, Verizon, GE Healthcare, and other Fortune 500 companies confronted the question directly: “Is Design Dead?” The consensus wasn’t about AI. It was about business priorities. Design has been deprioritized during a business cycle championing technology and marketing.</p><p>Netflix provides the clearest case study. Eighty percent of all viewing hours come from algorithmic recommendations. The homepage layout, row ordering, and even the thumbnails users see are determined by algorithms, not designers. Netflix’s personalization saves over a billion dollars per year in subscriber retention. When the business case is that strong, design becomes an execution function serving algorithmic strategy.</p><p>Growth teams present a similar challenge. <a href=""https://andrewchen.com/how-to-build-a-growth-team/"">Andrew Chen</a>, a prominent growth expert, notes that growth teams work best when they can run lightweight experiments quickly. Design-conscious companies resist this because their incentives reward large, complex projects rather than many small changes. So growth teams route around design, making decisions that move metrics even when they compromise user experience. Princeton found that <a href=""https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/dark-patterns-examples"">1 in 10 of 11,000 shopping sites</a> used dark patterns. Zurich University found 95% of popular Android apps had at least one dark pattern. The European Commission found 97% of apps used by EU consumers contained dark patterns.</p><p>These aren’t isolated bad actors. These are systemic outcomes when growth imperatives override design principles, and designers lack the technical fluency to advocate effectively in those conversations.</p><p>The root cause is simple: most product decisions are fundamentally technical. They involve technical constraints, technical trade-offs, technical debt, and technical feasibility. If you can’t participate in technical conversations, you can’t influence product strategy. You can’t influence product strategy, you end up in alignment meetings explaining user needs to people making technical decisions you don’t fully understand.</p><p>This is why the handoff happened. Not because AI replaced designers. Because designers couldn’t articulate why technical decisions should consider user impact in language that resonated with the people making those decisions.</p><h3>This Isn’t About Coding</h3><p>Let me be crystal clear: this is not an argument that designers should learn to code production software.</p><p>This is about strategic literacy. Understanding enough about technical systems to make informed design decisions and advocate effectively for users when those decisions are being made.</p><p>There’s a difference between writing production code and understanding what code does. Between implementing a database schema and knowing why data models influence user workflows. Between configuring a build pipeline and recognizing when technical debt is accumulating in ways that will limit future design possibilities.</p><p>Strategic literacy means you can:</p><ul><li>Evaluate whether AI-generated code is functional or broken</li><li>Understand API constraints well enough to design features that are actually feasible</li><li>Recognize when performance implications should influence interaction patterns</li><li>Participate in technical debt conversations because you understand what’s being traded off</li><li>Spot when “technical constraints” are actually implementation choices masquerading as limitations</li></ul><p>The design engineers who maintained influence through the 2024–2025 crisis weren’t necessarily writing backend services. But they understood technical systems deeply enough to design with constraints in mind, advocate for users in technical conversations, and ship work that didn’t require wholesale engineering rewrites.</p><p><a href=""https://vercel.com/blog/design-engineering-at-vercel"">Rauno Freiberg at Vercel</a> describes his role as providing “the Design team with Engineering firepower to lead and ship our own projects end-to-end.” <a href=""https://ui.land/interviews/paco-coursey"">Paco Coursey at Linear</a> says design and code don’t feel separate to him. These aren’t people who abandoned design for engineering. They’re people who refused to treat design as separate from implementation.</p><p>The counter-argument is always gatekeeping: requiring technical knowledge excludes people from design. But what actually excludes people is creating a professional track that leads to strategic irrelevance. Roger Wong’s research shows entry-level hiring has collapsed. Matt Ström warns that if we don’t train junior designers now, we’ll have no senior designers for complex work AI can’t do. Design Week points out that students aren’t being equipped with essential technical skills.</p><p>We told designers they didn’t need technical knowledge. Then we eliminated their jobs when they couldn’t influence technical decisions. That’s not inclusion. That’s malpractice.</p><p>The question isn’t whether designers should code. The question is whether designers should understand the medium they’re designing for. Whether they should be able to evaluate their own work. Whether they should have enough technical fluency to advocate for users when technical decisions are being made.</p><p>That’s the baseline for strategic relevance.</p><h3>What Changes</h3><p>The opportunity here is clearer than the design industry wants to admit: technical understanding is learnable, and the designers who develop it will have influence that others don’t.</p><p>Look at what technical literacy enables. <a href=""https://www.bbva.com/en/airbnb-design-thinking-success-story/"">At Airbnb</a>, a designer studying the star rating system realized replacing stars with hearts could feel more personal. That design change increased bookings by more than 30%. Not because the designer had great visual taste. Because the designer understood the technical system well enough to identify a high-leverage intervention.</p><p>At <a href=""https://medium.com/@broccolini/design-systems-at-github-c8e5378d2542"">GitHub</a>, designers contribute production code to the Primer design system. They don’t do this because they want to be engineers. They do it because understanding the technical implementation makes them better designers. They can prototype with real constraints, collaborate with engineers as peers, and ship work that actually functions.</p><p>Vercel’s design engineering team operates with “aesthetic sensibility with technical skills,” which allows them to “deeply understand a problem, then design, build, and ship a solution autonomously.” This isn’t a replacement for traditional design — it’s an expansion of what design can influence.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Vercel’s design engineering"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3IIzfKxMtEWgJwU93GFyaw.png"" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=""https://vercel.com/blog/design-engineering-at-vercel"">https://vercel.com/blog/design-engineering-at-vercel</a></figcaption></figure><p>The technical skills that matter most:</p><ul><li>Understanding data models and how they constrain user workflows</li><li>Knowing enough about APIs to design technically feasible features</li><li>Recognizing performance bottlenecks that should influence interaction patterns</li><li>Evaluating AI-generated outputs for technical correctness</li><li>Understanding how design systems map to component libraries</li><li>Participating in build-versus-buy discussions with actual technical context</li></ul><p>None of this requires a computer science degree. It requires curiosity about how things actually work and a willingness to learn technical fundamentals.</p><p>The designers maintaining strategic influence through 2024–2025 aren’t the ones with the best Figma skills. They’re the ones who can participate in technical conversations, evaluate trade-offs, and advocate for users in language that resonates with engineers and product leaders.</p><p>This is the path forward. Not back to “designers should code” debates from the 2010s. Forward to “designers should understand the systems they’re designing for” as a baseline professional expectation.</p><h3>The Reckoning</h3><p>When Figma’s AI generated Apple Weather app clones, it revealed that many designers couldn’t articulate what made a design original beyond surface aesthetics. When Figma Sites produced <a href=""https://adrianroselli.com/2025/05/do-not-publish-your-designs-on-the-web-with-figma-sites.html"">210 WCAG violations</a>, it showed that accessibility knowledge wasn’t widespread enough to catch obviously broken output. <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/ai-generated-ux-and-the-growing-accessibility-debt-how-to-fix-it-8109fda7d9d5"">Research shows</a> that 81% of homepages have low-contrast text, and when AI trains on this data, it perpetuates systemic exclusion. When Builder.ai collapsed after six years of pretending AI was doing what engineers actually did, it demonstrated how easy it is to fake technical competence in an industry that stopped valuing technical craft.</p><p>The designers who maintained influence through this period share one thing: technical depth. Not necessarily coding ability, but deep understanding of technical systems. They can evaluate AI output. They can participate in architecture discussions. They can advocate for users in technical terms that actually influence decisions.</p><p>The designers who lost influence — and there were many, given 150,000+ layoffs — often shared a different trait: they treated design as separate from implementation. They created mockups for engineers to “build.” They relied on tools without understanding outputs. They couldn’t evaluate technical trade-offs or participate meaningfully in technical conversations.</p><p>The question facing the industry isn’t whether AI will replace designers. It’s whether designers will develop the technical literacy needed to remain strategically relevant in a world where most product decisions are fundamentally technical.</p><p>Some will argue this sets the bar too high. That requiring technical understanding excludes people. But what actually excludes people is creating a professional track that leads to irrelevance. Entry-level hiring has collapsed. Design leadership roles are disappearing. The “Great Design Handoff” already happened, and it wasn’t to AI — it was to growth teams, algorithms, and business stakeholders who could at least speak the technical language of trade-offs and constraints.</p><figure><img alt=""A venn diagram showing what is design engineering."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pQ35G-p558gX5yK0L8l1gQ.avif"" /><figcaption>Image Source: <a href=""https://maggieappleton.com/design-engineers"">https://maggieappleton.com/design-engineers</a></figcaption></figure><p>The industry told designers they didn’t need to understand implementation. Then eliminated their influence when they couldn’t participate in implementation discussions. That’s not AI’s fault. That’s ours.</p><p>The technical reckoning is here. The designers who face it with curiosity about how systems actually work will have opportunities the industry hasn’t seen in years. The designers who keep insisting technical knowledge isn’t their job will find that strategic influence isn’t theirs either.</p><p>The choice, as always, is ours to make.</p><p><em>What technical knowledge do you think designers need most?

<h4><em>WCAG color contrast is more than just text</em></h4><p>Most designers know the basics of web accessibility and color contrast. We’ve memorized that “normal text” (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html#dfn-large-scale"">24 CSS pixels and below</a>) needs to meet a 4.5:1 contrast ratio with its background, and “large text” (greater than 24 CSS pixels) needs to meet a 3:1 ratio.</p><p><strong>But WCAG (</strong><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/""><strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</strong></a><strong>) color contrast requirements don’t stop at text.</strong> There are lesser known WCAG success criteria (or “rules”) that are still very important for inclusive design; these ensure interfaces are usable to users with low vision or color blindness.</p><figure><img alt=""Viewing YouTube’s homepage with different vision simulations, like red-green color blindness and sun-glare"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-l5gevfqLDE88Ha5TisA6g.png"" /><figcaption>Viewing YouTube’s homepage with different vision simulations, like red-green color blindness</figcaption></figure><p>Some of these forgotten requirements circle around UI components, inline links, and data visualizations, which all have color contrast rules of their own. When these details are overlooked, users can’t tell what’s interactive, what’s linked, or what the data is actually saying (even if all the text uses accessible colors).</p><p>And these accessibility gaps aren’t edge cases. They show up in mature Design Systems, enterprise products, and well-intentioned designs because they live outside the accessibility standards designers tend to learn and adopt.</p><p>To avoid these gaps for the future, let’s go over 3 ongoing color contrast issues, how WCAG applies beyond text, and who exactly is impacted by color contrast.</p><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: I reference WCAG 2.1, Level AA standards. If your product needs to comply with Level AAA, required color contrast ratios increase (i.e., </em><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-enhanced.html""><em>normal text needs a 7:1 ratio</em></a><em> with its background).</em></blockquote><h3>UI components that look accessible (but aren’t)</h3><p>WCAG criteria: <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html"">SC 1.4.11: Non-Text Contrast (Level AA)</a></p><p>In plain english, this WCAG criteria requires that non-text UI elements that are interactive or communicate meaning have a <strong>minimum of 3:1 contrast ratio</strong> against adjacent colors (like the UI background).</p><p>But what is covered by “UI elements”? Basically, anything that a user can interact with or needs to see to use; such as:</p><ul><li>Buttons and button states</li><li>Form fields and their borders</li><li>Checkboxes, radio buttons, and toggles</li><li>Focus indicators</li><li>Icons that convey meaning or affordance</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Spirit includes text fields that do not meet contrast requirements with a 1.6:1 ratio"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mzlbjZWOHK27EOSS3N1QaQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.spirit.com/flight-status""><em>Spirit</em></a><em> includes text fields that do not meet contrast requirements with a 1.6:1 ratio; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong>Important note</strong><em>: If color contrast fails WCAG standards from the Design System level, the failure is replicated across all product adopters; it’s critical to check system UI component’s color contrast.</em></blockquote><h4>What designers miss and why it matters</h4><p>This is where many designs that are intended to be accessible quietly fail. Since these UI elements don’t contain text, they’re excluded from color contrast checks. And yes, text is very important to check, but so are the UI elements that provide any product its functionality.</p><p><strong>Common gaps within UI elements include:</strong></p><ul><li>Input borders that blend into the product background</li><li>Custom focus indicators that rely on subtle color shifts instead of high-contrast</li><li>Icon-only controls (like buttons) that don’t meet contrast on their own</li></ul><p><strong>When UI elements lack minimum contrast, users can’t reliably:</strong></p><ul><li>Identify what’s interactive or understand UI component states (like hover)</li><li>Navigate interfaces using only their keyboard</li><li>Complete forms without repetitive errors</li></ul><figure><img alt=""BBC includes a primary CTA that meets contrast requirements with a 4.58:1 ratio"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9lBpa8t8UhfH8HfsgOkvOQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.bbc.com/""><em>BBC</em></a><em> includes a primary CTA that meets contrast requirements with a 4.58:1 ratio; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><h4>Who are the users impacted?</h4><p>Though low-contrast UI elements affect everyone at some capacity (you might have to do some squinting), they make products unusable to people like:</p><ul><li>Users with low vision who need distinct visual styling</li><li>Keyboard users who depend on focus indicators that stand-out on the UI</li><li>Older users experiencing reduced contrast sensitivity</li><li>Users in low-contrast environments (i.e., sun-glare, small screens, fluorescent lights)</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: To check a UI component’s contrast (or any element that needs contrast), you can also use </em><a href=""https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-disability-simulator/olioanlbgbpmdlgjnnampnnlohigkjla?hl=en&amp;pli=1""><em>Web Disability Simulator</em></a><em> on any web page to simulate how it looks for users with color-blindness or cognitive disabilities.</em></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Red-green color blind simulation on YouTube with the Web Disability Simulator Chrome extension"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QWZyIWC5rf7neuUBx-RhKQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Red-green color blind simulation on </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/""><em>YouTube</em></a><em> with the </em><a href=""https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-disability-simulator/olioanlbgbpmdlgjnnampnnlohigkjla?hl=en&amp;pli=1""><em>Web Disability Simulator</em></a><em> Chrome extension</em></figcaption></figure><h3>Data visualizations with low contrast</h3><p>WCAG criteria: <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html"">SC 1.4.11: Non-Text Contrast (Level AA)</a></p><p>This accessibility gap references the same WCAG standard as UI components from above. But though data visualizations (data viz) may not always be interactive, they’re communicating meaningful information.

But color contrast issues are frequently found in charts and heatmaps that use the brand’s color palette rather than accessibility-tested colors.</p><p><strong>Common issues with data viz include:</strong></p><ul><li>Chart colors that are distinguishable in isolation but fail 3:1 contrast when touching one another</li><li>Data series using colors that aren’t distinguishable for color-blind users (i.e., red-green)</li><li>Thin gridlines with low contrast that disappear against the background</li><li>Charts that use multiple colors without secondary text indicators</li><li>Legends that depend on matching colors instead of labels or patterns</li></ul><p><strong>When data viz lack contrast and use color alone, users can’t:</strong></p><ul><li>Clearly and quickly understand trends in the data set</li><li>Confidently compare data without the feeling of guessing</li><li>Lose access to critical insights (especially when the data isn’t provided in another way)</li></ul><h4>Who are the users impacted?</h4><p>Again, all users are affected on some level by low contrast data viz.

Designers typically think that since a paragraph of text meets the 4.5:1 color ratio requirement, any inline link using the same text color within the paragraph also passes. Since links are interactive elements, they have additional guidelines other than passing the color requirements for text.</p><p><strong>Frequent issues with inline links include:</strong></p><ul><li>Links that are differentiated only by an underline when the link receive mouse hover or keyboard focus</li><li>Link colors that meet contrast against the background, but not against adjacent text</li><li>Underlines removed for aesthetic or simplicity reasons</li></ul><p><strong>When inline links aren’t clearly distinguishable, users can’t:</strong></p><ul><li>Easily comprehend what’s interactive (especially when hidden in body copy)</li><li>Efficiently navigate a website or product page</li><li>Find important actions or information they need to complete a task</li></ul><h4>Who are the users impacted?</h4><p>I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again… this affects all users at some capacity. Inline links are not as recognizable to any user when the underline affordance or high contrast color is taken away. But for some users, it becomes impossible to identify links that could lead the user to information or product pages they need.</p><p>Users to consider when designing inline links include:</p><ul><li>Color-blind users who may not perceive color differences</li><li>Users with low vision who require visual affordances with high contrast</li><li>Users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from consistent patterns</li><li>All users scanning content quickly</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: A simple rule of thumb is to make a link look like a link for optimal usability and accessibility.</em></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Gov.UK includes inline links that meets contrast requirements with a 3.81:1 ratio AND are underlined"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3rOPtaAXaJBwGlfl3wKXcg.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid""><em>Gov.UK</em></a><em> includes inline links that meets contrast requirements with a 3.81:1 ratio AND are underlined; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>UI components, inline links, and data visualizations often fall outside the mental checklist of color contrast and accessible design.</strong> WCAG covers these elements, but it’s often overlooked when focusing on adequate contrast for text. This leads to websites and interfaces that look high contrast, but are near impossible to use for some user groups.</p><p>By spreading awareness to these accessibility gaps, we can expand how we define color contrast and better apply ideal accessibility practices. When these requirements are built into components, patterns, and Design Systems from the start, accessibility stops being a last-minute fix (or remediation plan) and becomes part of the design process.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=68cc224735b3"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/3-color-contrast-mistakes-designers-still-make-68cc224735b3"">3 color contrast mistakes designers still make</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Our brain is a prediction machine that can’t be stopped. No matter how hard we try, it will still build expectations.</h4><p>If you’re reading this, you’ve probably asked yourself the same question I always have: What exactly makes users subconsciously follow <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279871278_Color-in-Context_Theory"">Color Psychology</a>, <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles?srsltid=AfmBOopi3ws2HhTLq5t9k-4j8DcE9Ef_W6XddNvGAqidJSuDQZDW4XU4"">Gestalt principles</a>, and behavioral patterns like <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/hicks-law/"">Hick’s law</a>? Why does all of this work? Is there a way to understand the true nature of our brain and not just how it reacts, but why it predicts, expects, and perceives the world the way it does?</p><p>Now it’s time to go one level deeper — into the core of how our brain actually works. In this article, we’ll touch on one of the fundamental theories that helps me personally answer these questions, and I would love to share it with you. Buckle up, we’re shifting into nerd gear!</p><h3>The Free Energy Principle</h3><p>In 2010, in his paper <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2787"">The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_J._Friston"">Karl Friston</a> formally introduced a theory stating that every system, including living organisms, strives to minimize free energy. Simple enough: we don’t like surprises. But let’s take a closer look at what that really means.</p><figure><img alt=""Portrait of neuroscientist Karl Friston, author of the Free Energy Principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*SSE0hdbj4PtpTqh7.jpg"" /><figcaption>Karl Friston, Photo by Kate Peters (<a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/karl-friston-free-energy-principle-artificial-intelligence/"">WIRED</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The brain’s main task is to minimize the gap between expectation and reality. This gap is what the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle"">Free Energy Principle</a> defines as free energy. When the brain encounters unpredictable input, its stress level rises. And it’s crucial to understand: this isn’t about you as a person or a “user”, it’s about your brain. It’s not something we consciously control, but it’s something we can use.</p><p>After all, as humans, we don’t always chase predictability or comfort. Many people enjoy physical exercise, even though it’s technically stress for the muscles. We love movies with unexpected plot twists, and even comedy works by placing us in a familiar setup and then adding an unpredictable punchline.</p><p>That’s because we’re more than just our brains. The human organism and our consciousness is a complex system of subsystems, including our hormonal system, which can reward the brain with the right chemistry under stress, or reinforce behavior when we act in line with its internal “program.”</p><p>So, the Free Energy Principle is actually quite a complex theory, and there are different mathematical interpretations of it. But for simplicity and convenience, today we’re going to look at a more accessible formula:</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram of the free energy equation with each variable labeled."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OltXx93fAkWg9_8i2HvACw.png"" /></figure><p>We can break it down into several key variables:</p><ul><li><strong><em>F</em> </strong>— variational free energy: this is the result of our brain’s calculations. For the brain (or any predictive system) to remain in a stable, low-stress state, F should approach zero. The higher the free energy, the greater the stress or uncertainty in the system. This idea directly connects to the concept of entropy, the natural tendency toward disorder which both we and our brains constantly try to resist.</li><li><strong><em>s</em></strong> — sensory input: everything we receive from the external world — sounds, tactile sensations, visual images, etc.</li><li><strong><em>m</em></strong> — internal model: our internal representation of how the world works. Essentially, our expectations about external reality or specific aspects of it.</li><li><strong><em>P</em></strong><em> </em>— probability: represents the likelihood of a certain sensory input given our internal model (it’s defined by what’s in the parentheses but not part of the main operation). The result ranges from 0 to 1, since it’s a probability.</li><li><strong>−ln</strong> — natural logarithm: this function converts probabilities (values between 0 and 1) into a scale from 0 to infinity, making the difference between expectation and reality mathematically measurable but not limited.</li></ul><p>The higher the probability, the smaller the resulting value. In other words, our brain is “happy” when the probability of our expectations matching what we actually perceive equals 1 (maximum probability) — in that case, F=0. The lower the probability (P), the greater the amount of free energy (F): 1 = 0; 0.5 = 0.69; 0.1 = 2.3; 0.01 = 4.6.</p><p>Let’s look at an example. A user moves the cursor over something that looks like a button: text on a bright blue rectangle.</p><figure><img alt=""Interface example of a button with active cursor"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*idKF4TdvSkphrORSln-aGg.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p>m — the user expects that the button will somehow change its state, what we usually call a hover state.</p><p>s — nothing happens to the button itself, but the cursor changes.</p><p>Technically, the user’s expectations were violated. But since our internal models are more complex than a single visual reaction, the additional input (the cursor change) helped complete the picture. When the button eventually responds to a click, the user almost immediately forgets the odd interaction.</p><p>Their P might have dropped slightly, perhaps to 0.95, meaning the probability that their mental model still matches the incoming input remains very high. The amount of free energy is close to zero. The brain is calm, the user is satisfied, the product is sold.</p><p>Now let’s take a negative example. The user moves the cursor over the same button: the same text, the same blue rectangle. The user once again expects that clicking it will initiate a purchase, that’s our m (the internal model).</p><p>But the response is nothing: no color change, no cursor change, not even an error message. The user clicks repeatedly. Their P (probability) that their mental model matches the actual input, drops close to zero.</p><figure><img alt=""Interface example of a button with no hover feedback."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SN8vFhrI6J4EoE0zb1jFCA.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p>The brain starts trying to reduce the growing amount of free energy, sending out emotional signals. In this case, the button, the site, the entire interaction become irritants. Almost unconsciously, the user begins performing a series of random actions, trying to fix the problem.</p><p>And if we’re lucky, they eventually scroll up and notice that the email field is outlined in red with a message saying it’s required. They enter the email, click Buy again, and finally succeed.</p><p>Not as happy, but at least with a product on the way. All of this happened simply because the button had no disabled state, no visual communication that it couldn’t yet be pressed, forcing the user to waste five tense seconds clicking into nothing.</p><p>This is a fairly simple example that directly illustrates the relationship between our expectations and our perception of reality. But there are many others that you, as designers, already know well.</p><p>Take the Gestalt principles, for instance. We don’t just see a random collection of shapes but we instinctively try to group them and assign meaning. It’s something our brain does automatically, without conscious effort. That’s exactly why, at the beginning of this section, I emphasized that this principle isn’t about us as individuals. It’s about our brain itself.</p><p>Our brain constantly relies on its internal model, comparing it with the incoming sensory input we receive. And when the amount of free energy becomes too high, the brain automatically tries to fix the problem.</p><p>It starts to create new categories or groups, sending the necessary emotional signals to push us toward resolving the discrepancy. Sometimes, it adjusts the internal model itself, modifying m in the formula to reduce the gap between expectation and reality. That’s actually how we learn something new and this, in fact, can explain the very nature of our neuroplasticity.</p><p>But the brain can also go the other way distorting perception, effectively altering s in the formula, the sensory input itself. And that’s where we enter the territory of cognitive biases and perceptual illusions, an entire field in itself, and one that truly deserves the attention of us designers.</p><h3>Abduction is the key to humanity</h3><p>I’m confident in saying that almost every well-known principle we are using in design can ultimately be explained through the Free Energy Principle. But that doesn’t mean we, as designers, need to consciously apply it in our daily work. Good and even excellent designers usually operate within the beginner and intermediate levels of design psychology, and that’s more than enough to create meaningful, functional products.</p><p>For me personally, it has always been and still is fascinating to understand why things, principles, and rules work the way they do. That’s why I try to find explanations and new perspectives through different sciences. And psychology is one of them.</p><p>With this article, I’d like to invite you to look at the familiar design dogmas we follow from a slightly different angle and to try broadening our perspective.</p><p>In a world where AI already knows all these rules and can even create interfaces based on them, what may soon remain truly ours is our human curiosity, the desire to reach for truth, to question what we take for granted, and to look at problems from new angles, expanding the boundaries of any given task.</p><p>In the language of philosophy, specifically the branch of logic we, as humans and users, most often rely on deduction and induction.</p><p>Deduction is deriving consequences from established rules. When we build our hypotheses based on principles and patterns. All clickable elements should change their state on hover → This button changes its state on hover → Therefore, this button is a clickable element.</p><p>Induction is generalizing from experience. When we conduct direct user testing. Our user clicked 100 different buttons, and each time the button changed its state on hover → The user now expects that all buttons should change their state when hovered over.</p><p>But we, as designers, are expected to bring new ideas into the world.</p><p>So I’d like to invite you to look at another type of reasoning — abduction. It is the process of forming a hypothesis that could best explain an observation.</p><figure><img alt=""Triangular diagram showing the relation between abduction, deduction and induction with text descriptions."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/850/1*cLJYu98iQ0ogbr6iNisEuw.png"" /><figcaption>The relation between abduction, deduction and induction. <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Fig-A1-The-relation-between-abduction-deduction-and-induction-Several-alternative_fig1_48326326"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>We notice that users often close the payment page without clicking the button → What if the problem isn’t the button’s state but the emotional context — the anxiety or distrust triggered by the act of payment? → Let’s change “Pay” to “Secure Payment” and add the logos of trusted payment providers below the button to increase confidence.</p><blockquote>Abduction is the process of forming explanatory hypotheses. It is the only logical operation which introduces any new idea.<br /><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce""><em>Charles S.

It’s how we were able to achieve such heights of science and technology out of nothing.</p><p>And this ability appeared in us precisely because our brain tries to get rid of free energy. That’s why I believe this principle is important not only to try to explain user behavior, but it is fundamental for us, as creators, thinkers, and engineers.</p><h3>Final thoughts</h3><p>And as for the practical application of today’s topic, I suggest you the following approach as an experiment just for yourself: if you’re facing a tough problem or one you’ve solved a hundred times, try ignoring all design principles for a moment. Approach it as if you only had abduction to generate hypotheses and the Free Energy Principle to evaluate them.</p><p>Take a specific user and the situation they’re in, then sketch several alternative solutions you can score with the formula F = −ln P(s∣m).</p><p>Fill in the variables: m (what the user expected) and s (what the user actually saw). Then estimate which solution “minimizes free energy”, meaning yields the highest probability that perception will match expectation. And that’s your leading candidate.</p><p>And remember, psychology gives us the lens, design provides the tools, but the final verdict always belongs to the human being whose subjective perception can overturn any formula. That’s why theory is only valuable as long as it remains flexible, ready to yield to real observation, to the living unpredictable experience of the people we design for.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=0e557d122b81"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/lower-the-surprise-applying-the-free-energy-principle-to-ux-0e557d122b81"">Lower the surprise: Applying The free energy principle to UX</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4><strong>What product designers can learn from how they design intelligence flows.</strong></h4><p>Everyone thinks Perplexity and NotebookLM succeed because they use “better AI.”</p><p>They don’t. <strong>They use the same models as everyone else.</strong></p><p>I spent three months deconstructing both — not just as a user, but as an architect. I mapped where intelligence lives, traced where humans direct and where AI executes.</p><p><strong>Here’s what they actually did differently.</strong></p><p><strong>The answer isn’t in the AI models. It’s in how they architect the flow of work between human and AI.</strong></p><p>This is what I call <strong>Intelligence Flow Architecture</strong> — the design of HOW cognitive work flows between human and artificial intelligence. Not what the AI can do, but how the collaboration is structured. Where does intelligence live? Who does what work? How do they hand off tasks?</p><p>This is a design discipline most product teams don’t know exists.</p><figure><img alt=""The essence of Intelligence Flow Architecture: Same models, different flows, completely different results.

Visualization created with Gemini AI.</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>What I mean by “architecture”:</strong> I’m not talking about software architecture (microservices, backend systems) or information architecture (navigation, content structure). I’m talking about <strong>architecting the “how”</strong> — the flow of cognitive work between human and AI. Who does what? Where does intelligence live? How do they collaborate? This is the discipline of designing intelligent systems, not just intelligent features.</p><p>Let me show you exactly how Perplexity and NotebookLM do it — and what you can apply to your own products.</p><h3>The architecture difference</h3><p>Here’s what people miss:</p><p>Both products run on the same foundation — large language models, vector embeddings, search APIs, retrieval-augmented generation.</p><p><strong>Same ingredients. Completely different results.</strong></p><p>Why? Because they architected different <strong>intelligence flows</strong> — different answers to these critical questions:</p><ul><li>WHERE does AI work autonomously?</li><li>WHERE does human provide direction?</li><li>HOW do they hand off work between them?</li><li>WHAT intelligence lives in which layer?</li></ul><blockquote><strong><em>In his </em></strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ""><strong><em>June 2025 keynote at Y Combinator</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Andrej Karpathy — former director of AI at Tesla and OpenAI co-founder — described this exact shift:</em></strong><em> </em>“LLMs aren’t just tools anymore. They’re becoming operating systems. The LLM is the CPU, the context window is the memory, and the real design work is architecting how this new computer orchestrates problem-solving.”</blockquote><p>That’s exactly what Perplexity and NotebookLM understood.</p><p><strong>Watch what happens:</strong></p><p>When you ask <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/"">Perplexity</a> a question, AI doesn’t give you search results to click. It searches, synthesizes, answers, and cites sources — all autonomously.</p><p><strong>Flow:</strong> You direct → AI discovers → You evaluate</p><p>When you upload documents to <a href=""https://notebooklm.google.com/"">NotebookLM</a>, AI doesn’t just “chat about your docs.” It analyzes, maps relationships, and generates insights — without waiting for instructions.</p><p><strong>Flow:</strong> You curate sources → AI orchestrates knowledge → You explore</p><p>These are different architectures of collaboration.</p><p>Let me deconstruct both — layer by layer.</p><h3>Perplexity’s intelligence flow architecture: Real-time discovery</h3><p>What makes Perplexity feel different from Google isn’t better search. It’s a different distribution of cognitive work.</p><h4><strong>THE DESIGN DECISIONS:</strong></h4><p>Someone architected this. Someone decided:</p><ul><li>AI executes search autonomously (you don’t click 10 tabs)</li><li>AI synthesizes while streaming (you don’t wait for batch results)</li><li>AI handles citations in real-time (you don’t copy-paste sources)</li><li>Human directs through conversation (you don’t fill search forms)</li></ul><p><strong>Cognitive split: ~20% Human (direction + evaluation) / 80% AI (discovery + synthesis)</strong></p><p><strong>What this feels like to you as a user:</strong></p><p>You ask a question. Seconds later, you’re reading a synthesized answer with sources — without opening ten browser tabs. It feels like the system “just knows” what you meant and found the answer for you.</p><p>That feeling isn’t magic. <strong>It’s architecture.</strong></p><p>The intelligence lives in the synthesis layer, orchestrating search and combining sources in real-time.</p><figure><img alt=""Perplexity’s 5-layer architecture showing the 20% human / 80% AI cognitive split.

Document understanding.</p><h4><strong>THE DESIGN DECISIONS:</strong></h4><p>Someone architected this. Someone decided:</p><ul><li>AI works only with YOUR documents (not the entire web)</li><li>AI builds knowledge graph invisibly (you experience results, not structure)</li><li>AI generates multiple formats from same knowledge base</li><li>Human curates sources and exploration direction</li></ul><p><strong>Cognitive split: ~30% Human (curation + direction) / 70% AI (analysis + orchestration)</strong></p><p><strong>What this feels like to you as a user:</strong></p><p>You upload research papers. Within seconds, the system “understands” them — not just text search, but conceptual understanding. It finds connections you hadn’t seen. It can explain your own documents back to you in different formats.</p><p>That feeling isn’t magic. <strong>It’s architecture.</strong></p><p>The intelligence lives in the knowledge processing layer, building invisible structure that enables multiple interaction modes.</p><figure><img alt=""NotebookLM’s 5-layer architecture showing the 30% human / 70% AI cognitive split.

Note Layer 4’s gradient — it’s collaborative, where human and AI work together in the interaction loop. </em>Visualization created with Gemini AI.</figcaption></figure><h4>The pattern they both reveal</h4><p>Both succeed because they architected intelligence flows with clear principles.</p><p>(If you look back at the hero infographic at the top, you’ll see the contrast: Traditional AI = features bolted onto existing UIs. Intelligence Flow Architecture = intelligence embedded in the system’s core.)</p><h4><strong>The four principles</strong></h4><h3>Principle 1: Design backward from autonomous execution</h3><p>Don’t start with: <em>“What interface should we show?”</em></p><p>Start with: <em>“What will the system DO autonomously?”</em></p><ul><li>Perplexity: Search + synthesize + cite</li><li>NotebookLM: Analyze + map + generate formats</li></ul><p>Then design everything else to enable that autonomy.</p><p>This inverts traditional software design. Traditional products started with the interface — buttons, menus, workflows — then built backend systems to support them. Intelligence-first architecture starts with autonomous execution and works backward.</p><blockquote><em>The shift is profound: from </em>“How will users accomplish this task?” to “What can the system accomplish autonomously?” <em>As </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_RjOhCkhvQ""><em>Satya Nadella</em></a><em> noted, we’re moving business logic from the application tier to the intelligence tier. The execution layer defines your system’s value — everything else exists to enable it.</em></blockquote><p>Without this inversion, you end up with “AI features” bolted onto traditional interfaces. The intelligence feels like an add-on because it IS an add-on. True intelligence-first architecture means intelligence is embedded as fundamental structure, not added as features.</p><h3>Principle 2: Embed intelligence in specific layers</h3><p>Don’t bolt AI on as features.</p><p>Architect where intelligence lives:</p><ul><li>Perplexity: Intelligence in synthesis layer</li><li>NotebookLM: Intelligence in knowledge processing layer</li></ul><p>The intelligence isn’t visible as “AI feature” — it’s structural.</p><p>The test for embedded intelligence: Can you remove the AI and still have a functional product? If yes, intelligence is bolted on. If no, it’s embedded.</p><p>Perplexity without its synthesis intelligence doesn’t exist — it’s not “Google with AI added,” it’s a fundamentally different architecture where intelligence IS the product. NotebookLM’s knowledge processing layer isn’t a feature you can toggle off; it’s the system’s foundation.</p><p>This architectural embedding happens in specific layers of your five-layer stack. Intelligence doesn’t float everywhere — it concentrates where transformation occurs. In Perplexity, that’s Layer 2 (synthesis orchestration). In NotebookLM, it’s Layer 2 (knowledge graph construction). Identify where YOUR system’s intelligence must live, then build everything to support that layer.</p><h3>Principle 3: Design clear human/AI boundaries</h3><p>Define precisely where AI works autonomously and where human provides direction:</p><ul><li>Perplexity: Human directs → AI discovers → Human evaluates</li><li>NotebookLM: Human curates → AI orchestrates → Human explores</li></ul><blockquote><strong><em>Think of this as creating control maps — the new journey maps for AI experiences.</em></strong><em> Instead of mapping what users do, you map who is in control (user, AI, or both) and when that control shifts. As </em><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/from-journey-maps-to-control-maps-17aac58b9dd9""><em>Rob Chappell</em></a><em> notes, </em>“The question is no longer ‘What is the user trying to do?’ The more relevant question is: ‘Who is in control at this moment, and how does that shift?’”</blockquote><p>This is the evolution from traditional user journeys to human-AI collaboration flows.</p><p><strong>This pattern is becoming so clear that in June 2025, Karpathy dedicated his Y Combinator keynote to it.</strong> He calls it “partial autonomy” — systems where AI generates and humans verify in a continuous loop.</p><p>The architectural insight: <strong>The fastest generation-verification loop wins. Not the most autonomous AI.</strong></p><p>That’s why <a href=""https://cursor.com/"">Cursor</a> (coding), Perplexity (search), and NotebookLM (research) are succeeding — they optimized the loop, not the autonomy.</p><h3>Principle 4: Optimize for cognitive distribution</h3><p>Not: “Can AI do this task?”</p><p>But: “SHOULD AI do this, or SHOULD human?”</p><ul><li><strong>Human strengths:</strong> Goal definition, judgment, creative direction, evaluation</li><li><strong>AI strengths:</strong> Discovery, synthesis, pattern recognition, execution</li></ul><p>Both products make this mapping explicit in their architecture.</p><p>This requires mapping cognitive strengths systematically. From your Hybrid Cognition Map: Humans excel at goal definition, context understanding, judgment calls, ambiguity resolution, ethical decisions, creative direction, and stakeholder intuition. AI excels at information retrieval, pattern recognition, rapid iteration, consistency, tedious execution, multi-source synthesis, and 24/7 availability.</p><p>The magic happens at the intersection — not human OR AI, but human AND AI working in complementary strengths. Perplexity distributes: human defines information need (judgment), AI discovers and synthesizes (execution). NotebookLM distributes: human curates sources (context), AI processes and orchestrates (synthesis).</p><p>Poor cognitive distribution creates friction. If you ask humans to do what AI does better (tedious data processing), or ask AI to do what humans do better (strategic judgment), the collaboration fails. Design explicitly for strengths, not just capabilities.</p><figure><img alt=""The complete framework: Four principles that define how Perplexity and NotebookLM architect human-AI collaboration.

I took photos of the worksheet, showed them to an AI, and asked it to generate similar exercises. Seconds later: a new practice set, perfectly matched to her level.</p><p>She finished it. Asked for another. I already had everything loaded — another set appeared in seconds.</p><p><strong>This wasn’t impressive because the AI was smart.</strong> It was impressive because I’d designed the <strong>how</strong>: Photo → Parse → Generate → Verify → Iterate.

The Tesla lesson</h3><p>Before we dive into what this means for product teams, let’s address the obvious question: <strong>Why design for partial autonomy instead of full autonomous agents?</strong></p><p>In his June 2025 keynote, Karpathy shared a telling story from his five years building autonomous systems at Tesla:</p><p>In 2013, he took a perfect self-driving ride in a Waymo — zero interventions, flawless. He thought: “Self-driving is imminent.”</p><p><strong>That was 12 years ago.</strong> Even now, <a href=""https://waymo.com/"">Waymo vehicles</a> that appear driverless still require significant human teleoperation and oversight.</p><blockquote><strong><em>His warning applies directly to product design:</em></strong><em> When AI generates massive outputs — 10,000 lines of code, complete research reports, fully redesigned interfaces — you haven’t saved time if verification takes hours. </em>“When I see things like ‘oh 2025 is the year of agents,’ I get very concerned. This is the <strong>decade</strong> of agents.”</blockquote><blockquote><strong>“We have to keep the AI on the leash,”</strong> <em>Karpathy emphasized. Not because AI isn’t capable, but because </em><strong><em>verification speed determines actual productivity.</em></strong></blockquote><p>This is why Intelligence Flow Architecture prioritizes the generation-verification loop over full autonomy. The goal isn’t to remove humans from the loop. <strong>The goal is to make the loop spin as fast as possible.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Karpathy’s lesson from 12 years at Tesla: Fast generation-verification loops beat pursuing full autonomy.

Loop speed determines productivity, <em>not autonomy level. </em>Visualization created with Gemini AI.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>A note for designers:</strong> You might be thinking “I’m not a system architect. Can I actually apply this?” Yes. Intelligence Flow Architecture isn’t about backend engineering — it’s about design thinking applied to human-AI collaboration. Start small: Pick one workflow. Map where human directs vs where AI executes. That’s architecting intelligence flows. You’re already doing this thinking — now you have language for it.</p><h3>What this means for product teams</h3><p>Here’s what changes when you adopt Intelligence Flow Architecture:</p><h4><strong>BEFORE (AI Features):</strong></h4><ul><li>PM says: “Let’s add AI to this workflow”</li><li>Designer asks: “What should the AI button look like?”</li><li>Engineer builds: API call to GPT → show response</li><li>Result: Feature that feels bolted on</li></ul><h4><strong>AFTER (Intelligence Flow Architecture):</strong></h4><ul><li>PM asks: “What cognitive work should AI handle autonomously?”</li><li>Designer maps: Human direction → AI execution → Human evaluation</li><li>Engineer architects: Intelligence layer + orchestration layer + execution layer</li><li>Result: System that feels intelligent</li></ul><h3><strong>The pattern</strong></h3><p>Perplexity and NotebookLM didn’t ask “How do we add AI?”</p><p>They asked: “How do we architect collaboration between human and artificial intelligence?”</p><p>That’s the difference between an AI feature and an intelligent system.</p><p>That’s Intelligence Flow Architecture.</p><p>And that framework — deciding where intelligence lives, how work distributes, when systems execute autonomously — <strong>that’s intelligence-first architecture.</strong></p><p><strong>Same AI models.</strong><br /><strong>Different architecture.</strong><br /><strong>Completely different experience.</strong></p><p>Now you know why.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ace59eeda531"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/perplexity-and-notebooklm-dont-use-better-ai-they-use-better-intelligence-flow-architecture-ace59eeda531"">Perplexity and NotebookLM don’t use better AI—they use better intelligence flow architecture</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<p><strong>Spoilers ahead. </strong>Is it actually possible to recover from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/inner-child-healing"">childhood trauma</a>, or will the effects linger forever? That’s the question <em>Ella McCay </em>asks, the new film from three-time Academy Award winner James L. Brooks (<em>Terms of Endearment</em>, <em>As Good as It Gets</em>). Following Ella McCay, played by Emma Mackey (<em>Barbie</em>, <em>Sex Education</em>), the 34-year-old lieutenant governor juggles the grief of her mother’s death as well as a strained relationship with her father, with help from her caring Aunt Helen, played by <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/freakier-friday-movie-fashion-costumes"">Jamie Lee Curtis (</a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/freakier-friday-movie-fashion-costumes"">Freaky Friday</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/freakier-friday-movie-fashion-costumes"">, <em>Everything Everywhere All At Once</em>)</a>. </p>



<p>Ella exhibits signs of people-pleasing behaviour in both her work and personal life after watching her father repeatedly cheat on her mother. She seems doomed to repeat the cycle, trying her best to have a “normal” marriage with her husband Ryan (Jack Lowden), which results in her overcompensating to make him happy. Principal psychologist <a href=""https://enrichinglivespsychology.com.au/about"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Carly Dober from Enriching Lives Psychology</a> tells <em>Refinery29</em> this could be due to a need to “establish a false sense of safety” and notes it’s a common trauma response. “People-pleasing can also be linked to emotional dependency. [This] occurs when someone has unmet psychological needs that they may try to satisfy within close interpersonal relationships,” Dober says. “[It] is a pattern of behaviours people may engage in to get others to like them, and to avoid rejection, criticism, or embarrassment. It’s linked to traits such as depression, anxiety and low self-esteem.”</p>



<p>Mackey confirms that <em>Ella McCay </em>is a study of the “human condition”, and tells us that’s partly what drew her to the role. “The film is very much about cycles and cycles being broken, or not in a few cases, and about what you decide to make of yourself,” Mackey tells <em>R29</em>. Throughout the film, her Aunt Helen acts like a driving force in her life, and calls out the behaviour of Ella’s husband. Mackey notes it can be “unsettling” to have somebody by your side pointing out flaws or truths you want to avoid, but in some ways, there’s a “comfort” to it as well. “She’s the truth sayer, and says the uncomfortable thing when I don’t want to hear it, and it’s absolutely spot on every time,” Mackey says. “And we all need one of those people in our lives just to bring us back to what’s real and to make us think about it… and then we’ve got to work with it, work through it.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>We all need one of those people in our lives just to bring us back to what’s real and make us think about it… then we’ve got to work with it, work through it.</p><cite>Emma MackeY</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>There’s one particular line in the family that gives audiences a closer look into Ella’s psyche, and that’s when she admits she adores her husband because he comes from a “normal family”. She deems it “normal” because his parents are still married, unlike Ella’s own experience. It’s telling that she prioritizes this above other traits he possesses, such as his manipulative tendencies. By making choices rooted in trauma, she’s ended up in the midst of another unhappy cycle. Curtis says these family dynamics and trauma portrayed in <em>Ella McCay</em> are what make this film feel so rooted in reality. “That’s what makes movies so relatable, and particularly family movies, is that you can sit there and watch a movie as a family and realise your family is different from the family you’re watching on screen, but there are a lot of similarities,” Curtis explains. “Hopefully, families have an Aunt Helen, that person in your life who champions you even though you’re getting battered.” </p>



<p>As difficult as it is to see Ella’s life crumble around her during the film, Mackey says it’s important to stumble at times so you can succeed in the future. “Unless you [stumble], you have no perspective, and you don’t know what’s important,” Mackey says. “You don’t want to seek or search what you’re curious about if you don’t stumble a couple of, or a lot of times.”</p>



<p>And while the drama-comedy tugs at the heartstrings, Curtis says she wants audiences to take away one thing. “There is no opposite word for trauma, but hope comes close,” she says, quoting the film. “That, to me, is where you understand that even with traumatic experiences, hope for the future, hope for your family, hope for the world, hope for potential. All of it comes pretty close to being a counterpoint to the bad things that have happened.”</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11869365.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/led-face-mask-red-light-skin-benefits"">LED face masks</a> are everywhere these days, but many seem more alike than not. It’s as if we have a <em>Devil Wears Prada</em> blue belt situation on our hands. So, when Shark Beauty unveiled its first foray in the skin tech space, I was intrigued — not only because I’m a fan of the brand, but because this wasn’t just <em>any</em> LED mask. </p>



<p>As the name suggests, the <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/cryoglow-tm-cooling-led-face-mask-P515543"">CryoGlow™ Cooling &amp; LED Face Mask</a> offers red and blue light therapy to help brighten, firm, and clear skin. However, it’s also equipped with cooling pads to depuff and wake up tired eyes. If that sounds like some seriously souped-up beauty tech, it’s because it is. Could this be the game-changer my routine needs? I set out to find out.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/P515543"">Shark CryoGlow Under-Eye Cooling+LED Face Mask</a>, $349.99</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11869244.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=756&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=256%3A189"" /></figure>



<h2><strong>What is Shark’s CryoGlow mask, and how do you use it?</strong></h2>



<p>Per the brand, the <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/P515543"">CryoGlow face mask</a> was developed with dermatologists and clinical trials to back its claims of reducing the appearance of fine lines and reducing breakouts within weeks. It features something called iQLED Technology™ (aka, derm-developed treatment cycles of red, blue, and deep infrared light) distributed evenly throughout the inside of the mask. But as I hinted at earlier, perhaps the biggest point of differentiation is the Cryo-inspired cooling mechanism, which claims to visibly depuff the under-eye area post-use.</p>



<h2><strong>What makes Shark’s CryoGlow mask special?</strong></h2>



<p>My CryoGlow mask is a pretty shade of powder blue (it also comes in a muted lilac), with a matching satin pouch for storage. I love that it powers up via a remote control instead of an app. (Call me old school, but I miss the days when we didn’t have an app for <em>everything</em>.) You can cycle through four different treatments for various concerns  — acne, fine lines, a four-min express treatment, and one focused on tightening and brightening the under-eye area — which combine infrared light and red and blue LEDs (plus those cooling pads, which feel like heaven for tired, puffy eyes), so you can tailor your session based on what your skin is craving that day. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951829.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Is Shark’s CryoGlow mask worth it?</strong></h2>



<p>At $350, it’s among the more affordable LED masks I’ve seen —  it’s still expensive but solidly less so than other popular ones on the market. (For comparison, <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/spectralite-faceware-pro-P435378?skuId=2109718&amp;icid2="">Dr. Dennis Gross’ version</a> retails for $455, <a href=""https://us.currentbody.com/products/currentbody-skin-led-light-therapy-mask?variant=41833057157217"">CurrentBody’s Series 2</a> is $470, and <a href=""https://www.revolve.com/therabody-theraface-mask/dp/TRAG-WU16/"">Therabody</a>’s is $650. Hollywood aesthetician <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/shani-darden-by-deesse-pro-led-light-mask-P502216"">Shani Darden</a> launched an LED mask that retails for a whopping $1900.) The full-face mask feels durable but is shockingly lightweight, making it among the most comfortable ones I’ve tried, too. </p>



<p>I first started testing this mask out as part of my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/doing-own-wedding-bridal-makeup-advice"">wedding skin prep</a>, and now that I’m six months post-wedding (and almost an entire year into testing this out), I have to say: It’s still one of the most effective steps in my entire beauty routine. My biggest skin goals right now are keeping acne flareups at bay, enhancing my overall glow, and reducing inflammation. In the past, I’ve struggled with consistency in using LED masks, so they didn’t do a whole lot for me. My consensus now is that they can be a great addition to your skincare routine — but only if you commit. (It’s like sunscreen, in that sense: The best one is the one you’ll use everyday.) </p>



<p>Another unexpected benefit of LED masks that I don’t think gets talked about enough has nothing to do with skin. After weeks of carving out time at the end of my day for some LED therapy, I realized that it had become something I genuinely looked forward to, just to get a few minutes of not doing anything else. Sure, sometimes I’d scroll through Instagram while sitting through an eight-minute treatment, but most days, I’d just lay on my couch cuddling my dog (he doesn’t mind one bit that I’m giving <em>Iron Man</em>), or even close my eyes for a little meditative moment. The fact that I have healthier, happier skin to show for it? Simply a (really good) bonus.</p>

<p>Rejoice! The last days of 2025 bring the onset of Capricorn season. On December 21st, the sun officially enters Capricorn and it’ll be a potent moment of contemplation, meditation, deliberation, and aspiration. The reason is that we are entering the coldest time of the year, as the Winter Solstice marks the beginning of a new season on the same day the sun enters Capricorn. The start of Yule connects us with friends and families to celebrate the past year and look forward to the future. At this juncture, we can start <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/manifest-goals-2025-zodiac-signs"">manifesting our dreams</a> by expressing our heartfelt intentions, which catapult us into the place and space we wish to be. </p>



<p>Since Capricorn energy is associated with working hard to make our desires come to fruition, we often put our best foot forward to seize the day at the office. Usually, we become rigid in our efforts to become the next CEO, get the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/salary-story-flight-risk-job-promotion"">promotion we deserve</a>, or elevate our status. Capricorn energy climbs the corporate ladder with ease, skipping steps or resorting to manipulative tactics to win. Success is due to our tenacity in evolving and our desire for accolades. The goal of the month is to take charge and be a boss. Working hard is a must, but so too is playing hard. </p>



<p>With Capricorn season coinciding with a new year, we have hope and the incentive to start anew, recognizing that we can refine structure to improve situations and relationships. As a result of this thinking, we begin to discuss the concept of time and how much we can accomplish in the weeks ahead to leave a lasting legacy over the twelve months. It’s not that the vibe makes us competitive per se, it’s that we want to prove our power to the world to gain accolades and respect from those we care about. Building an empire and committing to projects that speak to our spirit define our lives — so grab your inner sea goat by the horns! </p>



<p>Capricorn is one of the most sensitive signs of the zodiac. They are the watery part of the Earth because they reside in both the ocean and on land. The sea goat has a very tender heart and will go to bat for anyone in their inner circle. They have an austere reputation due to their no-nonsense and mature attitude. Capricorn energy can be highly intuitive because it helps us align more closely with our gut feelings. In the weeks ahead, we will be able to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-intuition-gut-instinct-personal-safety"">trust our opinions and instincts</a>, knowing that we are choosing the right path for ourselves, even when we are torn between options. After a moment of reflection, we will be able to find guidance within.</p>



<p>This year, Capricorn season brings us face-to-face with our last chance to learn from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/saturn-retrograde-in-aries-and-pisces-horoscope-july-2025-meaning-effects"">Saturn in Pisces</a>. The karmic planet is going to be changing signs during Aquarius season, which is coming up, so we need to wrap up the story that we’ve been perpetuating over the past three years. Being that Saturn is the planetary ruler of Capricorn, it’s for us to see how we’ve grown since March 2023. When Saturn leaves Pisces for the next 27 years on February 13th, 2026, it will bring a major vibe shift. Consider how we can cultivate our spirituality, establish firmer boundaries with others, and commit to what we genuinely love. </p>



<p>The overall energy is quieter than in previous years, allowing us to heal and relax. Finding peace and solace in our hearts and lives will allow us to find serenity. It would be great to have a calm entrance into the new year, so we can take the proper steps to propel our passions forward. </p>

<p>Of all the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charlotte-tilbury-makeup-skincare-review"">makeup brands</a> — and there are far too many to count — only one consistently dominates beauty editor conversations. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/merit-beauty-tinted-mineral-sunscreen-spf-50-review"">Enter: Merit.</a></p>



<p>If one of us has impossibly <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tatcha-dewy-milk-moisturizer-review"">dewy skin</a>, plumper lips, or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-lash-curl-finisher-review"">longer lashes</a> than usual, the question is always the same: Is it Merit? I even know one editor who insisted her makeup artist use entirely Merit products on her <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/doing-own-wedding-bridal-makeup-advice"">wedding day</a>, and for good reason. It’s one of the few brands that makes makeup look like it’s simply part of you — like you’re wearing it, not the other way around. </p>



<p>Think of the brand as a step above <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/summer-makeup-trends-2025"">no-makeup makeup</a>. It keeps things natural with sheer textures and effortless sticks, yet everything can be layered for a bolder, more striking look. But with both editors and TikTok beauty enthusiasts singing its praises, which Merit products are actually worth your money? </p>



<p>I put $380 of Merit makeup and skincare to the test, and here’s my honest verdict.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-uniform-spf-45"">Merit The Uniform Tinted Mineral Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 45</a></h2>

<p>In May, I called this the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/merit-beauty-tinted-mineral-sunscreen-spf-50-review"">best tinted sunscreen</a> I’d ever tried, and months later, I still stand by that. In fact, I’ve been using it ever since I discovered it. Unlike others, which can feel thick or chalky, this goes on and absorbs like a lightweight moisturizer, with medium coverage that’s enough to conceal my breakouts and dark circles. The finish sits somewhere between matte and dewy. Most tinted sunscreens fade after a few hours, but not this one. Its staying power is impressive for something so featherlight, and it always feels comfortable. That said, I don’t rely on it for sunscreen alone — I always layer it over a dedicated SPF.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-minimalist"">Merit The Minimalist Perfecting Complexion Stick</a></h2>

<p>I’ll be honest: I didn’t think I’d enjoy using this, but it’s quickly become my go-to concealer. As someone with acne-prone skin, I’ve always been told to avoid creamy stick products because they often contain pore-clogging waxes. While this does have some waxes on the ingredient list, it remarkably doesn’t break me out. I usually use it to spot-conceal, tapping it in with my fingers, and I’m always impressed by the coverage and how well it tucks away redness. When I’m feeling too lazy for “proper” makeup, I scribble it all over my face and blend with a dense, fluffy brush. The result feels like a light tint with the pigment of a foundation, but it always looks like my skin, and never like a mask.</p>

<p>I’ll admit I wasn’t a big fan of Flush Balm the first time I tried it — but that was because I had the completely wrong shade. My advice: go slightly darker than you think. Since the product is pretty sheer, it needs to be built up if you want a bolder blush look. Here, I’m wearing Le Bon Bon, a stunning fuchsia pink, and I’m starting to think I’ll never go back to the other blushes in my makeup bag. It gives my cheeks the most natural, just-come-in-from-the-cold flush. My partner even noticed and complimented my makeup. Thanks to the creamy texture, it doesn’t last quite as long as I’d like, but a quick layer of translucent powder fixes that. If you don’t want to swipe it directly onto your foundation (I hate transfer!), tap a dense brush over the dome of the product and apply it that way.</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised by how effortlessly this glided onto my skin and how quickly it blended — the texture is that silky. Sometimes foundation can flatten my features, but this product brings depth back in. I use it in the hollows of my cheeks to define my bone structure, down the center of my nose, and across my temples for a sun-kissed glow, and even on my eyelids as a natural-looking eyeshadow. It layers beautifully under Flush Balm, though if you want it to last all day, a setting powder is a must.</p>

<p>I usually skip highlighter, but the marbled look of this domed stick was so mesmerizing, I had to try it — and I’m glad I did. It literally looks and feels like dewy skincare, thanks to moisturizing squalane and skin-healing vitamins and amino acids. It contains ultra-fine pearl pigments but never looks dusty or glittery. Instead, it gives a gorgeous, natural gloss that only improves as your skin’s oils blend with it throughout the day. Here, I applied some in the inner corners of my eyes, and I’m convinced it makes me appear more awake. </p>

<p>Ok, this is my new favorite eyeshadow. I can never be bothered with two or three shades, and smoky eyes are absolutely not my skill set, but a single wash of color can take my makeup from meh to next level, tying together blush, bronzer, and lips in perfect harmony. Here, I’m wearing Studio, which the brand calls a “cool taupe.” It leans slightly bronze without any orange, so it looks like it belongs on my eyes. The best part, though, is how effortlessly it applies. You could use your finger, but I go with a fluffy brush — the blend is seamless, and it takes just 10 seconds to create this look. Even better? It lasts much longer than other cream eyeshadows I’ve tried, and because it dries down to a soft powder, it barely creases.</p>

<p>I wasn’t sure how I’d get this pencil through my thick brows — it’s that fine — but it’s exactly what I needed. Using it actually made me realize how bad the pencil I was using before really was. Because it’s so precise, you can fill in the gaps, mimicking the finest, softest brow hairs without anything looking blocky. The spoolie on the end lets you feather it out if you go a little heavy. Just don’t press too hard, or you’ll snap the nib in half and lose it down the sink.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrow-1980%3F_pos%3D1%26_psq%3Dbrow%26_ss%3De%26_v%3D1.0%26variant%3D43975772405946"">Merit Brow 1980 Volumizing Pomade</a></h2>

<p>Brow pomades are usually too wet and messy, but this one is just right. My brows are naturally quite dark, but this adds the perfect finishing touch after the pencil, locking my thick hairs in place without making them feel stiff or greasy like others. On lazy days, I’ll just run the brush through, and it instantly gives my brows more volume. I also love that the tapered brush lets you define the inner and outer corners without any smudging.</p>

<p>Because this lip liner is so sheer, it doesn’t stick around for very long. That said, it’s so moisturizing that reapplying is easy. Sometimes I don’t even bother looking in the mirror; I just scribble it on and smudge it out with my fingers. My lips are chronically dry, and most liners only make that worse, but this one glides on beautifully, thanks to the jojoba oil. Most days, I use this as my lipstick, enlisting a fluffy brush to blend it out and blur the edges. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip"">Merit Signature Lip Lightweight Lipstick</a></h2>

<p>To me, this feels more like a tinted lip balm than a true lipstick — the name says it all, I guess! It glides on easily, giving a satin-like veil of color that feels moisturizing, thanks to squalane and sunflower seed oil. It only lasts a couple of hours on me, but because it’s so soft and lightweight, I just swipe it on like a balm. Here I’m wearing Slip, though I tend to prefer the pinker shades on my olive skin. I also wish the packaging felt a bit more luxe. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fclean-lash"">Merit Clean Lash Lengthening Mascara</a></h2>

<p>This mascara takes a bit of work — three to four coats in my experience — but the result is the most naturally fluttery lashes. It has an old-school bristle brush that requires slow, deliberate combing to build up layers, rather than a silicone brush that deposits product instantly. That actually worked in my favor, because it didn’t leave any clumps. Instead, my lashes looked long and fluffy, almost like falsies. The best part is that it’s a tubing mascara that comes off with just warm water. Tubing formulas are also less likely to smudge or flake, and this one never does. I’m already on my third tube.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fshade-slick"">Merit Shade Slick Tinted Lip Oil</a></h2>

<p>Most lip oils I’ve tried feel like a lip gloss in disguise, but this one is different. It isn’t sticky at all, so you don’t have to worry about it trapping hair when you step outside. Quinoa seed oil is the star ingredient, acting like skincare for your lips by deeply moisturizing and supporting the skin barrier — the outer layer that keeps moisture in and bacteria out. The tint is subtle but lovely, and I like layering it over lipstick for a soft, glossy boost. Because it’s an oil rather than a gloss, it sinks in fairly quickly, so to pop in your purse for touch-ups.</p>

<p>This is such a quenching moisturizer, and even though it’s designed to prime skin for makeup, I often wear it on its own for a glow boost. Moisturizing glycerin and hydrating hyaluronic acid are the stars, while skin-strengthening peptides support healing, and collagen and elastin help keep skin supple. It doesn’t contain any reflective pigments, but you wouldn’t guess that, considering the natural dew it gives dry skin. Even better, it’s non-comedogenic, so it’s much less likely to clog pores or cause breakouts. When I use this, my makeup lasts noticeably longer than it does over other moisturizers. </p>

<p>I’ve wanted <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/perms-in-style-trend-types"">a perm</a> for years now, but with the amount of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/igk-antisocial-midnight-silk-mask-review"">damage my hair</a> went through with multiple bleaching sessions (I had a pastel pink phase), I had to wait until I had a full head of virgin hair. When I told one of my best friends I was finally about to get a Korean digital perm, she was horrified and said I would probably regret it. Look, I get it. The perm is controversial. You probably instantly think of giant fluffy ’80s hairdos or tight ringlets. But unlike traditional perms, the Korean style uses heat technology to create softer curls, which appear more natural. </p>



<p>My hair is naturally straight with a slight wave that becomes more obvious the shorter it is. I also have incredibly thick and heavy lengths, so when I use a curling iron, I have to douse my hair in hairspray to ensure the curls don’t fall out. As somebody who’s always wanted curly hair, getting a Korean digital perm was an easy decision. Both my older brother and sister have perms, so I was confident going in. I went to my hairstylist Chloe Choi at <a href=""https://www.chloehair.com.au/"">Chloe Hair &amp; Beauty</a>, but Korean perms are becoming more popular in salons worldwide. Together, we discussed what could be done while looking at some photos I’d brought along for inspiration. She confirmed that my hair type is frizzy with a slight natural wave, and we settled on a direct digital perm to create some tighter curls. </p>

<p>There are a handful of benefits to a Korean perm: “Normal perms mean sometimes you can’t see definition in the curls, but with digital perms you can,” said Choi, who used to work at a salon in Myeong-dong, South Korea, before moving to Sydney. Before we started with my perm, Choi recommended starting with a Japanese Tokio Treatment, which helps repair hair from the inside out. By replenishing it with keratin, it strengthens, moisturizes, and smooths each hair strand. “A lot of people really like this brand,” Choi explained. “It’s a repairing treatment, and it adds moisture to your hair. Some people will come back after their perms get dry and then have another Tokio Treatment,” she told me.</p>



<h2>What is a Korean digital perm?</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11947860.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>

<p>Choi started by washing my hair and applying the Tokio Treatment, before setting up an additional hot steam treatment to help hydrate each strand of hair. The steam “opens” up the hair cuticle, allowing moisture and products to absorb. After getting a small trim where Choi enhanced my layers, my hair was rewashed with a pH-balancing shampoo. She then followed this with a Korean product that protects the hair from the typically harsh perming chemicals used to break and reset the protein bonds in the hair. It’s this which results in a curl or wave. </p>



<p>Next, Choi placed the digital perm lotion directly onto my hair and rolled sections tightly into curlers to take shape, then plugged each curler in, allowing them to be set by heat. Choi told me that my hair was “strong”, so we had to wait over 20 minutes before it started to set. Then we headed back to the basin where my hair was washed with a neutralizer, snapping the protein bonds back into place. Et voilà! I was now a member of the curly hair club.</p>



<h2>How do you style a Korean digital perm?</h2>



<p>To style my hair, Choi gave me a slight side part, which created a more voluminous look from the scalp. She added some curl cream to define the waves and recommended investing in some good products. Her top tip? “If you have frizzy hair and you want to style it while it’s dry, mix curl cream with a little bit of water in your palms before using it on your hair,” she said. “This helps get rid of the frizz and also hydrates it.”</p>



<p>Styling a digital perm at home isn’t too difficult, either. I have a sensitive scalp, so I’ve purchased some sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. Sulfate-free products will also prolong the perm’s results. I wash my hair with lukewarm water in the shower before scrunching up the curls with a microfiber towel. Next, I add curl cream to define my curls and continue to scrunch them upwards, before using my <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.laifentech.com%2Fproducts%2Flaifen-se-2-high-speed-hair-dryer"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Laifen Hair Dryer</a> (a Dyson dupe) with a diffuser to blow-dry the perm in place. </p>

<h2>How long do you have to wait after a Korean perm to wash your hair?</h2>



<p>Your stylist will let you know how long you should go without washing your perm à la <em>Legally Blonde</em>. For me, I had to wait a minimum of 48 hours before washing my hair after getting my digital perm.</p>



<h2>Can a Korean digital perm cause damage to your hair?</h2>



<p>A digital perm uses chemicals that alter your hair structure and heat to set it in place, so most hairstylists recommend doing it on virgin hair. They also recommend steering clear of perms if your hair is bleached, chemically straightened, or very fine. Bleach in particular weakens the hair by breaking its bonds, which means perm solutions don’t interact well with it. Ultimately, the hair often lacks the strength to hold a set shape, making the process more likely to fail.</p>



<h2>How do you take care of your Korean perm?</h2>



<p>Getting a perm might increase frizz if your hair is prone to it. This is because when the chemical process weakens the hair, it also lifts the cuticle. I’d recommend investing in a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fslip-pure-silk-pillowcase%2F4186794%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopqmzmVbIIqoypAqEzT6eEntgnIoFgt2xwHEu4gn-JL76f3n-bF"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">silk pillowcase</a> or a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fwomens-mulberry-silk-bonnet-with-long-ribbons%2F8701502%3F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">silk bonnet</a> to help keep the frizz to a minimum.

<p>Doing your research and choosing a properly qualified expert is key. I would also recommend bringing reference photos so your stylist can see which kind of curl you are after. It’s also important to discuss your hair health and type, and whether a perm will cause extra frizz or breakage for you. </p>



<p>I can safely say that having a digital perm has led to more conversations about my hair than I’ve had in years — and it looks <em>much</em> healthier than my pastel pink or purple-silver combo. I’m able to wake up with voluminous hair ready to go, and if I need to style it a little bit, I can just use some curl cream, which also helps hydrate my hair. It’s less maintenance than colored hair, so I’m convinced I’m a perm girl for life. </p>

Given their <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-petite-workwear-ann-taylor"">petite size</a>, you can easily stack them to climb your ear or wear them solo. From twisted tubes to diamond accents, there’s a huggie for every sartorial vibe.</p>

Best of all, brands have designed just as many options in white gold as they have in the metal’s yellow-gold counterpart, including classic small and large hoops, as well as textured and bubbled designs.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Chunky Gold Hoop Earrings</h2>

<p>Make a statement with a pair of go-to large gold hoops. How big you go in circumference is up to you, of course. An oversized pair made from a single thin wire is a classic, while others feature sculptural details begging for a double-take. Continuous circles and open-ended backs both bring just the right amount of drama to everything from a black turtleneck to a tailored blazer — and require little other jewelry. </p>

<em>This holiday season, we’ve found the gifts that feel great to get and even better to give. Shop our collection of editor-approved holiday gift guides <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-art-of-giving"">here</a>.</em><br /><br />‘Tis the season for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-makeup-looks"">holiday parties</a>, and we’ll be remiss if you show up to these celebrations empty handed. It’s also time for visiting family (and perhaps over-staying your welcome) so it’s thoughtful to offer up some goodies as a “thank you.” Or maybe you have someone on your shopping list who just moved into a new place (or is the self-proclaimed homebody of your friend group). In any of these cases, we’ve curated a list of host and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-housewarming-gifts"">housewarming gifts</a> that’ll elevate your giftee’s spaces.<br /><br />Depending on your budget (and how generous you’re feeling this holiday season), this guide features a range of products between $20 and $200 for white elephant exchanges and holiday soirées. For homebodies, consider luxe Quince robes, artsy Piecework puzzles, and eclectic Fellow tea kettles. For the new resident, opt for a smart Hatch alarm clock, viral Anthropologie glassware, and money plants. And for the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hosting-friends-at-home-socializing"">holiday party host</a>, you can cart up sweet treats, unsuspecting board games, non-alcoholic drinks. <br /><br />And maybe it’s no surprise that a majority of these gifts deal with gathering around the table — from Le Creuset mini cocottes and Lenox cream and sugar sets to Caraway bar accessories and BonBon candy boxes — because food is universally the way to the heart.<br /><br />Be sure to also check out our related gift guides, like for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-luxury-gifts-under-50"">luxury gifts under $50</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gifts-for-woman-who-wants-nothing"">for the woman who wants nothing</a>, for suggestions on more home décor and cooking gifts) Just get to shopping, because most retailers' shipping cutoffs are <strong>December 18</strong> for Christmas arrivals.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.
