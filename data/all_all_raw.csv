<p>Across Europe and North America, pedestrianisation is increasingly being deployed as a context-specific urban strategy shaped by distinct economic, social, and spatial pressures. As cities continue to reassess the role of streets in the wake of economic shifts, climate pressures, and changing mobility patterns, pedestrianisation is emerging as a tool in current urban transformation efforts. Across <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/london"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">London</a>, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/new-york"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">New York</a>, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/houston"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Houston</a>, and <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/stockholm"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Stockholm</a>, ongoing pedestrian-first projects are testing different pathways toward more resilient and walkable cities, ranging from statutory planning and capital construction to research-driven visioning. London's Oxford <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/street"">Street</a> is advancing through consultation and governance reform to address retail decline; New York's Paseo Park is moving from a temporary pandemic intervention into permanent infrastructure; Houston is accelerating the pedestrianisation of its downtown core in preparation for a global sporting event; and Stockholm's Superline is using design research to rethink the future of an inner-city motorway. These initiatives reveal how pedestrianisation is being actively negotiated, designed, and built today, adapting to local motivations while converging on a shared objective of streets that perform as resilient public spaces rather than traffic conduits.</p>",

<h4>Designing trustworthy AI for healthcare products.</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BPMSzNXvppl613yAsV2cgw.png"" /><figcaption>User holding a phone using an AI healthcare assistant</figcaption></figure><p>AI is entering one of the most human domains: healthcare. It helps people track sleep, manage chronic conditions, monitor mental health, and navigate loneliness. It listens, advises, and sometimes comforts. Yet despite these advances, hesitation remains, not because the algorithms are weak, but because the experience does not always feel reliable.</p><p>In this context, <strong><em>trust</em></strong> is not just an emotional response. It is about system reliability, the confidence that an AI assistant will behave predictably, communicate clearly, and acknowledge uncertainty responsibly. In healthcare, that reliability is not optional. Even when AI performs well, people still hesitate. They ask: <em>Can I rely on this? Does it really understand me? What happens if it’s wrong?</em></p><p>Patients will not act on guidance they do not trust, and clinicians will not adopt tools they cannot interpret. Yet most discussions about healthcare AI focus on accuracy, regulation, or data quality. The lived experience of reliability, the part users actually engage with, often remains underdesigned.</p><p>Trust is not built by algorithms alone. It is shaped by clarity, empathy, and predictable behavior. Micro-decisions matter, how an AI care assistant expresses uncertainty, the tone it uses when discussing symptoms, and how transparently it explains its limits. These design choices determine whether people rely on a system when it matters most.</p><p>For healthcare designers, the role extends beyond usability. We design for psychological safety, ensuring technology does not confuse, mislead, or cause harm. <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/the-role-of-ux-in-ai-driven-healthcare-2ed0ffc15801""><strong>Roxane Leitão (2024)</strong></a> describes this shift as UX moving from interface design to <strong><em>risk mediation</em></strong> in AI-driven healthcare.</p><h3><strong>Trust is a design problem, not an AI problem</strong></h3><p>Conversations about trust in AI often drift toward technical questions: <em>How accurate is the model? How clean is the data? How fair is the output?</em></p><p>These questions matter, but they miss a core truth: users do not experience algorithms. They experience interfaces. Jakob Nielsen’s observation that <a href=""https://www.uxtigers.com/post/ai-new-ui-paradigm""><strong>AI is the first new UI paradigm in 60 years</strong></a> underscores this shift: intelligence is now expressed through interaction, not screens alone.<strong> </strong>People engage with tone, timing, and transparency. They form mental and emotional models of a system based on how it behaves under uncertainty.</p><p>Take AI-powered symptom checkers. Many rely on similar clinical models and datasets, yet users trust some far more than others. The difference is rarely accuracy alone. It lies in how uncertainty is framed, when human escalation occurs, and whether the system explains its reasoning.</p><figure><img alt=""Symptom checker demo from ADA Health"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZPMhikb0CCQDaIj3tHrMgA.gif"" /><figcaption>ADA Health © Symptom checker demo</figcaption></figure><blockquote><em>When a chatbot says, </em><strong>“Based on what you shared, this could be consistent with a mild infection,”</strong> <em>versus</em> <strong>“You might have an infection and should seek care immediately,”</strong> <em>the underlying model may be identical. The experience is not. One response supports informed judgment; the other triggers anxiety. That shift affects behavior, follow-up, and long-term trust.</em></blockquote><h3><strong>The emotional layer of accuracy</strong></h3><p>Healthcare AI is becoming more precise, but precision alone does not drive trust. What matters is whether people feel they can rely on the system in practice.</p><p>In its reporting on AI and chest X-ray diagnosis, The New York Times<strong> </strong>described a recurring pattern: AI systems performed well in benchmarks, yet experienced radiologists made better decisions in real clinical settings. The story emphasized that the problem was not technical failure, but what happens when AI moves from controlled environments into everyday medical practice. Radiologists explained that they interpret images in context, weighing patient history, ambiguity, and uncertainty. By contrast, <a href=""https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/ai-nhs-tests-radiologist-lung-disease-diagnosis-jl5h3t59w?id=17515457033&amp;gad_source=1""><strong><em>the AI systems featured in the article</em></strong></a> could detect patterns but struggled to explain why a finding mattered or how confident it was. Clinicians did not reject AI; they stressed that it worked best as an assistant, not an authority. When conclusions arrived without context or visible uncertainty, hesitation followed, not because the AI was wrong, but because it was difficult to rely on safely.</p><p>Interfaces that feel inconsistent, cold, or evasive undermine confidence, even when the model is strong. Conversely, systems that communicate clearly, behave consistently, and acknowledge uncertainty support reliable decision-making, even when answers are imperfect.</p><p>As AI becomes part of daily health routines, designers play a key role in:</p><ul><li>Turning complex care flow into clear signals users can trust and act on</li><li>Deciding when the system should sound confident, cautious, or humble</li><li>Communicating risk and uncertainty without creating unnecessary fear</li></ul><h3><strong>Designing the micro-interactions of reliability</strong></h3><p>Reliance is built through micro-interactions:</p><ul><li>How the AI care assistant responds to “<strong><em>I’m tired”</em></strong></li><li>Whether it remembers prior concerns or treats every interaction as new</li><li>How it communicates limits or inability to help</li><li>Whether it sets realistic expectations instead of overpromising</li></ul><p>These signals accumulate, creating either a sense of dependable consistency, or its absence.</p><figure><img alt=""The Fitbit App Is Turning Into an AI-Powered Personal Health Coach"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*igRBOAa4hzdnKyBvBRbBaA.png"" /><figcaption>Julian Chokkattu for Wired © «The Fitbit App Is Turning Into an AI-Powered Personal Health Coach »</figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://youtu.be/9Az-rDDEuT8?si=Jsc4H8XaVA4EI28k""><strong>Fitbit’s AI Coach</strong></a> offers a useful example. As Julian Chokkattu described in <a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/fitbit-app-ai-personal-health-coach/""><strong><em>Wired</em> (2025)</strong></a>, Fitbit’s shift toward an AI-powered health companion focuses less on prediction and more on explanation. It does not diagnose or claim medical authority, yet millions rely on it daily for sleep insights, recovery guidance, and activity suggestions. Its credibility comes from consistency, data grounding, and clear boundaries. By explaining why it makes suggestions, for example, “<em>Here’s a breakdown of what your data tells us</em>…” and framing guidance as optional rather than prescriptive, the system informs rather than instructs. Credibility, here, is designed, not declared.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9YCpC1hQKHz4or0a5om7Dg.png"" /><figcaption>Fitbit AI Health coach using Gemini ©</figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://ouraring.com/blog/oura-advisor/?srsltid=AfmBOoqA5zX5G67vLW5h-GqgPToLWFdkdumhxP55SWiGVnEo8iXqdQED""><strong>Oura</strong></a><strong> © </strong>provides another example. Its AI-generated readiness and sleep insights frame daily scores as directional signals, grounded in trends across sleep, heart rate variability, and recovery data. The interface consistently explains why a score changes and emphasizes context, reminding users that readiness fluctuates and should inform decisions, not dictate them. By avoiding absolutes and making uncertainty visible, Oura © supports sustainable, informed behavior. <strong><em>Trust</em></strong> emerges from predictable, transparent guidance, not precision alone.</p><figure><img alt=""Oura’s AI-Powered Personal Health Companion, 2025"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nPP7QfNd8hOMXqQ5S3g47Q.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Oura ©’s AI-Powered Personal Health Companion, 2025</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>The design paradox of healthcare AI</strong></h3><p>Healthcare AI operates in a space that is both deeply human and highly regulated. Users expect empathy, yet systems must remain factual. They want guidance, but AI cannot diagnose. They seek simplicity, but transparency introduces complexity.</p><p>Balancing these tensions is where UX becomes strategy. Design is no longer about polish or delight. It defines the relationship between humans and technology in moments of vulnerability. As <a href=""https://www.g-co.agency/insights/healthcare-ux-design-transforming-patient-journeys-for-better-care""><strong><em>G &amp; Co. (2025)</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong>describe, healthcare UX increasingly functions as care choreography, aligning emotional, informational, and clinical layers. Trust in healthcare AI is not a technical output, it is a design outcome.</p><h3><strong>Designing for trust: three core principles</strong></h3><h4><strong>Progressive transparency</strong></h4><p>The AI care assistant explains its actions without overwhelming users. It communicates what it knows, what it does not, and how it reached its conclusions.</p><blockquote><em>For example, instead of saying, </em>“<strong>This application does not provide medical advice,</strong>”<em> the system might say, </em><strong>“I’m not a doctor, but I can help you understand your symptoms and decide whether to speak with a healthcare professional.”</strong><em> Making uncertainty visible, such as indicating “70% confident,” while offering next steps reassures users and preserves agency</em>.</blockquote><h4><strong>Calibrated empathy</strong></h4><p>The AI care assistant adjusts its tone to the user’s context, acknowledging emotion and uncertainty without amplifying anxiety. AI mental-health products like Wysa © and Woebot © exemplify this approach, guiding users toward coping strategies or human support without emotive excess.</p><p>If a user says, <strong>“<em>I’m feeling anxious</em>”</strong> a helpful response might be, <strong>“<em>Here are a few techniques that may help”</em></strong><em>, or </em><strong><em>“I can help you find professional support</em>”</strong> rather than a generic emotional reaction like, “<em>I’m sorry you’re feeling that way </em>❤️.”</p><p>Active listening cues such as <strong><em>“It sounds like…”</em></strong>, avoiding overly friendly avatars, and maintaining emotional consistency make empathy functional: it recognizes feelings while guiding toward clear next steps.</p><h4><strong>Consistent reliability</strong></h4><p>The AI care assistant behaves predictably across interactions, so users know what to expect. Consistency appears in voice, style, context awareness, privacy considerations, and responsiveness. Making the system’s actions visible reduces confusion from sudden silences or unexpected behavior. Holistic consistency also limits AI hallucinations <strong><em>(</em></strong><a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01670-7""><strong><em>npj Digital Medicine, 2024</em></strong></a><strong><em>)</em></strong> and prevents misleading outputs. Predictable systems reduce cognitive load, letting users focus on health rather than interface interpretation.</p><p><a href=""https://www.hingehealth.com/fr/fr/about/our-approach-to-ai/""><strong><em>Hinge Health</em></strong></a> illustrates these principles in practice. Its AI-driven programs integrate clinician oversight to maintain progressive transparency, guide interactions with calibrated empathy, and deliver consistent, predictable feedback. This approach reinforces trust, human judgment, and patient agency simultaneously.</p><h3><strong>DesignOps and collaborative design</strong></h3><p>In healthcare, a good user experience must also be safe and accountable. DesignOps plays a critical role; key design decisions, ethical, clinical, and psychological, should be documented and defensible. Alignment across UX, product, data, and clinical teams creates shared accountability.</p><p>High-performing teams involve clinical co-design early, run cross-disciplinary reviews, and treat user research as validation, measuring trust as a real outcome. When trust becomes a shared goal, the product shifts from tool to <strong><em>companion.</em></strong></p><h3><strong>Measuring the UX of trust</strong></h3><p>When users interact with AI care assistants, clicks and retention are not enough. Emotional insight matters. Beyond engagement metrics, teams increasingly track:</p><ul><li><strong>Perceived reliability:</strong> <em>Does this assistant give credible answers?</em></li><li><strong>Transparency recall:</strong> <em>Do users understand its limits?</em></li><li><strong>Emotional safety:</strong> <em>Did the experience reassure or confuse?</em></li></ul><p>These measures reflect a growing shift toward <strong>trust as a design KPI</strong>, supported by qualitative research and sentiment analysis.</p><h3><strong>Design as a layer of safety</strong></h3><p>Safety in healthcare AI is not only technical or clinical; it is experiential.</p><ul><li><strong>Clear disclaimers</strong> reduce misuse</li><li><strong>Timely reassurance</strong> reduces anxiety</li><li><strong>Predictable care flows</strong> reduce cognitive load</li></ul><p>The design system, therefore, is not just aesthetic, it’s behavioral infrastructure. It shapes how people feel in moments that matter. That’s a responsibility, not just a craft. In healthcare, good design can literally make people feel safer, and act safer.</p><figure><img alt=""Heidi Health is an AI scribe for clinical documentation that incorporates clinician review to refine outputs, adding a layer of reliability that automation alone cannot provide."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0NC8tqa_GAcYv8k4bFwNuQ.png"" /><figcaption><strong>Heidi Health ©</strong> An AI scribe for clinical documentation that incorporates clinician review to refine outputs, adding a layer of reliability that automation alone cannot provide.</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Human-in-the-loop as a design choice</strong></h3><p>Visible human oversight is a strong trust signal. On <a href=""https://huma.com/products/huma-intelligence""><strong><em>Huma Therapeutics</em></strong></a> ©’s platform, generative AI synthesizes data and drafts insights, but clinicians review every output. AI supports care without replacing accountability. Making human oversight visible transforms AI from an invisible authority into a transparent assistant. Trust becomes tangible because responsibility remains clear.</p><figure><img alt=""Huma Intelligence automates health data summarization to streamline administrative workflows."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Il_jS0VxSV-b5qBg5ijOcw.png"" /><figcaption>Huma Intelligence (Hi) © automates health data summarization to streamline administrative workflows.</figcaption></figure><blockquote>What’s powerful about this example isn’t the brand or the technology itself; it’s the design choice to make human oversight visible, intentional, and reassuring. That’s how trust moves from being an abstract value to something tangible in the experience.</blockquote><h3><strong>Closing thought</strong></h3><p>Designing AI for healthcare means designing for trust, vulnerability, and agency, simultaneously. <strong><em>Trust</em></strong> is not abstract. It can be designed, documented, measured, and protected. The goal is not to make machines appear human, but to make technology worthy of human reliance. In digital health, <strong><em>trust</em></strong> is not a luxury; it is a prerequisite.</p><p>When we build a health AI assistant or companion, we’re inviting vulnerability. People share their symptoms, their fears, their habits. They’re stepping into a space where mistakes, misunderstandings or miscommunications really matter. Our responsibility as designers is to make that exchange safe, by showing limits, guiding with care, and behaving consistently enough that users know what to expect.</p><p>Ultimately, the next frontier is agency: empowering people with control, not just information.</p><p><strong>I hope this article sparks new ways of thinking about design in AI healthcare.

<h4>Generative AI and the long history of artistic automation</h4><figure><img alt=""An AI-generated image in the style of a Renaissance drawing. The drawing features a Renaissance era studio but with futuristic elements such as robot arms and mechanical computers"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qtSUcZMRdCQn9eZJtfBeyg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Image generated via Google Nano Banana</figcaption></figure><p>The discourse surrounding generative AI in the creative arts is frequently characterised by a sense of historical rupture, a seismic shift unlike any that has come before. Critics often frame the emergence of Large Language Models and diffusion-based image generators as an unprecedented existential threat to the ‘soul’ of human expression, a black swan event that may signal the end of human creative sovereignty. However, when we look back over the history of Western art and technology, it becomes clearer that this anxiety is not a new phenomenon but rather a recurring structural feature of the relationship between human intent and technical innovation. Whenever a new tool emerges that threatens to lower the barrier to entry or automate a process previously governed by arduous manual labour, the established artistic class has responded with a mixture of moral panic, accusations of ‘soullessness,’ and a retreat into essentialist definitions of <a href=""https://daily.jstor.org/when-photography-was-not-art/"">what constitutes ‘true’ art</a>.</p><p>To understand this moment, we must contextualise AI within the history of artistic tools and conceptual shifts, while simultaneously confronting the very real socio-economic and ethical challenges it poses to the creative ecosystem.</p><h3>Deconstructing the toupee fallacy</h3><p>Early criticism of generative AI focused on the poor quality of its output. GenAI was not yet a threat because it could not compete with human creative output on quality or believability.</p><p>The visceral reaction against early GenAI perhaps stemmed from a hypersensitivity to anomalies that break the illusion of human authorship. The ‘uncanny valley’ describes a revulsion response to humanoid representations that are almost, but not quite, human — a phenomenon observed in robots, animatronics, and increasingly, AI-generated imagery. When an AI image displays six fingers or background incongruities, the viewer immediately labels it as ‘artificial’ and files it away as evidence that AI is easily detectable and low-quality.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/eb1dab60a0821709bef73c934e03b92c/href"">https://medium.com/media/eb1dab60a0821709bef73c934e03b92c/href</a><p>This creates a false impression of the technology’s overall capabilities through several reinforcing psychological biases. <a href=""https://gregrobison.medium.com/fooled-by-fakes-how-the-toupee-fallacy-blinds-us-to-high-quality-ai-content-a41e6b16b998"">The Toupee Fallacy</a> ensures that only the most noticeable (and typically worst) examples are identified, leading to the belief that AI is inherently detectable and of low aesthetic value. Flawless AI-generated images pass by unnoticed and unquestioned, creating a survivorship bias where only the failures are used to judge the entire category. This mental machinery is further fueled by the uncanny valley, where minor glitches like extra fingers are perceived as deep moral or spiritual failures rather than technical ones. Finally, anchoring bias causes us to fixate on these first ‘bad’ impressions, leading to a resistance to recognizing that these models improve exponentially over time.</p><p>This desire for authenticity can be observed in the ‘Invisible CGI’ phenomenon in the film industry. To guard against a backlash toward CGI in cinema, studios frequently market films by claiming “No CGI was used,” despite employing thousands of digital artists to composite scenes, remove safety rigs, and enhance environments. This practice was the subject of a video essay by Jonas Ussing titled <a href=""https://youtu.be/7ttG90raCNo?si=-FBLjvFtoqSpG8VI""><em>“NO CGI” is really just INVISIBLE CGI</em></a>.</p><p>When the CGI is ‘invisible,’ the public credits the ‘practical’ mastery of the director; when it is ‘bad,’ the technology is blamed. Direct experience becomes an unreliable guide to overall quality, as the viewer samples from the bottom of the distribution while remaining oblivious to the top performers.</p><h3>The mechanization of vision: from Vermeer to the silicon brush</h3><p>The most persistent argument against GenAI is that it removes the skill of the artist, allowing an amateur to produce high-quality work without the arduous training traditionally associated with mastery. Yet, the history of the Old Masters suggests that ‘skill’ has always been a fluid concept, frequently augmented by hidden technical aids. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockney%E2%80%93Falco_thesis"">Hockney-Falco thesis</a>, proposed by artist David Hockney and physicist Charles Falco, argues that the dramatic rise in naturalism in Western art from the early Renaissance was not due solely to improved talent, but to the widespread use of optical devices such as the camera obscura, camera lucida, and curved mirrors.</p><figure><img alt=""An illustrated diagram of the function of a camera obscura"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UE8Pr5R_ZtcI2ioTCIRrhw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Illustration of a “portable” camera obscura studio in Kircher’s Ars Magna Lucis Et Umbrae (1645).</figcaption></figure><p>Johannes Vermeer is often cited as the archetype of this intersection between art and technology. Analysis of Vermeer’s work reveals ‘circles of confusion’ (pointillés) — optical artifacts that are physically impossible for the human eye to perceive but are characteristic of the ‘imperfect lenses’ of 17th-century camera obscuras. These halations of light on reflective surfaces, such as polished wood or glass, suggest that Vermeer was not ‘eyeballing’ his scenes but was instead ‘transcribing the intensities of light’ projected onto his canvas. Furthermore, the maps hanging in the background of Vermeer’s interiors have been found to be cartographically precise, a level of accuracy that <a href=""https://www.americanscientist.org/article/camera-obscurities"">strongly supports the use of a projection device</a>.</p><p>The historical trajectory of these aids directly parallels modern AI capabilities. The camera obscura, used by Vermeer and Canaletto, functioned by projecting a real-world scene onto a flat surface for tracing–a process mirrored by modern tools like Stable Diffusion’s ControlNet, which provides a structural ‘sketch’ for a model to fill. Similarly, the camera lucida, a prism device allowing an artist like Ingres to see the subject and canvas simultaneously, parallels current ‘image-to-image’ techniques that transform a base composition into a polished work.</p><p>Critics of the Hockney-Falco thesis, much like critics of AI, argue that such tools take away from the greatness of the masters. They maintain that a ‘man of genius’ should not require mere mechanism to achieve realism. However, experiments by Tim Jenison demonstrated that an individual with no formal training as a painter could reproduce a Vermeer-like image using a system of lenses and mirrors available in the 17th century (see Penn &amp; Teller’s documentary <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3089388/?ref_=nm_knf_t_1""><em>Tim’s Vermeer</em></a>). Jenison’s work proved that Vermeer’s genius was not necessarily found in the manual dexterity of his hand, but in his choice to use technology to capture light in a way that was previously unthinkable.</p><p>Critics might argue that Vermeer still required the manual dexterity to apply the paint, whereas AI automates the image creation itself. This highlights the first major ‘shade of grey’: the transition from the handcrafted image to the ‘mechanically assisted’ image is centuries old, but the <em>degree</em> of automation in AI represents a quantum leap that challenges our definition of artistic labor.</p><h3>The human algorithm: the atelier system and the ‘broken pipeline’</h3><p>A secondary critique of AI-generated art is that it is ‘dehumanised’ because a machine performs the labour. This argument relies on the romantic myth of the ‘lone genius’ labouring in solitude, an image that has long permeated art history but rarely reflects the reality of major historical commissions. From the Middle Ages through the 19th century, artistic production was organised through <a href=""https://serenademagazine.art/were-the-old-masters-really-working-alone-inside-the-renaissance-atelier/"">guilds and the atelier (workshop) system</a>.</p><p>In the studios of masters like Raphael and Peter Paul Rubens, the master functioned more as a creative director than a solo laborer. Raphael presided over a ‘hive of activity’ in Rome with more than fifty assistants. He would provide the ‘cartoons’ (preparatory drawings), while the actual brushstrokes were often executed by pupils who specialized in specific tasks: one might paint the drapery, another the clouds, and a third the architectural backgrounds. <a href=""https://serenademagazine.art/were-the-old-masters-really-working-alone-inside-the-renaissance-atelier/"">The master would reserve for himself only the most critical elements</a> (faces and hands) before signing the final work.</p><figure><img alt=""A engraving print showing a bustling Antwerp atelier: at centre the master paints Saint George and the Dragon, while an assistant mixes oil pigments, a youth copies a sculpture, and other hands grind colours and paint portraits."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*eGZNn9jArnSh27NBXLG4sA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Invention of Oil Painting, by Philip Galle, c. 1580–1605. Showing a bustling Antwerp atelier: at centre the master paints Saint George and the Dragon, while an assistant mixes oil pigments, a youth copies a sculpture, and other hands grind colours and paint portraits. Source: Royal Museums of Greenwich, London</figcaption></figure><p>Generative AI functions as a digital extension of this atelier system. The prompter acts as the ‘master,’ handling conceptualisation and curation, while the algorithm acts as the Apprentice or Journeyman, taking on the labour of pigment grinding (data preparation), underpainting, and the execution of complex backgrounds or environmental details. Even the specialists of the Renaissance, who focused solely on flesh or water, find a modern equivalent in Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) models trained to reproduce specific styles or objects with high fidelity.</p><p>This system reveals that the ‘master’s signature’ represented a brand and a vision, not necessarily the manual labour of the signer. A painting signed ‘by Raphael’ fetched more than one painted by an unknown journeyman, even if the journeyman performed 90% of the manual labour. Generative AI is the latest iteration of this ‘operational elevation,’ allowing the artist to focus on strategy, decision-making, and leadership instead of routine monitoring or manual repetition.</p><p>Yet, here lies a profound contemporary downside: the <a href=""https://people-work.io/blog/junior-hiring-crisis/"">Junior Hiring Crisis</a>. In the traditional atelier, the apprentice performed ‘grunt work’ (grinding pigments, stretching canvases) in exchange for training and a pathway to mastery.</p><figure><img alt=""A graph showing the change in senior and junior employment rates after the launch of ChatGPT. Senior employment continues to rise post-ChatGPT but junior employment is shown to be declining."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*azsnHgpU4d5kWox-yMkUmQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5425555"">A study from Harvard</a> published in October 2025 cites that early-career employees from 22–25 years old are experiencing greater unemployment while senior hiring remains stable or even growing.</figcaption></figure><p>AI is likely to continue ‘eating the bottom of the career ladder.’ By automating the entry-level tasks that once served as a rite of passage, such as proofreading copy, resizing layouts, or simple coding, the technology is dismantling the traditional apprenticeship model. Recent data indicates a sharp contraction in early-career roles; UK tech companies, for instance,<a href=""https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/16/uk_tech_grad_jobs/"">cut graduate roles by 46%</a> in 2023–2024. This broken pipeline suggests that, while AI may offer ‘operational elevation’ for senior professionals, it threatens to leave the next generation without the foundational experiences required to develop professional judgment.</p><h3>The Luddite misunderstanding: wages, not aesthetics</h3><p>The term ‘<a href=""https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/luddite"">Luddite</a>’ is frequently weaponised in modern discourse to dismiss critics of AI as technophobic. However, the actual history of the Luddite movement provides a more nuanced lens. The original Luddites were skilled textile workers in the early 19th century who objected to the use of machinery to circumvent standard labour practices and undermine the livelihoods of skilled craftsmen.</p><p>This historical legacy is reflected today in three distinct ways. The original Luddites of 1811 fought against mechanization as a tool to lower wages and hire unskilled labour, just as modern professional artists fear market saturation by AI-assisted ‘amateurs’. The Neo-Luddite movement of the 20th century expanded this into a philosophy of distrust toward technology as a system of social control, paralleling modern critiques of AI as an ‘alienating’ force that separates art from nature. Finally, the Romantic Movement’s reaction against industrialisation, which celebrated the ‘lone genius’ and ‘sublime nature’, underpins the current ‘soul in art’ argument that AI lacks genuine human feeling.</p><p>The Luddites were reacting to a shift from a domestic system, where craftspeople were paid usual price, to a factory system that prioritised efficiency. They were not against technology per se (many were skilled operators); they were against its inappropriate application to lower wages and de-skill the workforce. When applied to the arts, this argument is often misunderstood as a claim that AI makes ‘bad art.’ In reality, the fear is socio-economic: that AI will make cheap art that devalues human labour. Just as the power loom did not destroy the concept of clothing, AI is shifting art from a manual-labor economy to a conceptual-curation economy.</p><h3>The intellectual divorce: conceptual art and the ‘idea as machine’</h3><p>The move toward conceptualism in the 20th century fundamentally challenged the requirement for an artist to possess manual technical skills. Marcel Duchamp’s invention of the ‘<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readymades_of_Marcel_Duchamp"">readymade</a>’ in the 1910s declared that the creative act resided in the choice of the object, not its manufacture. By taking mass-produced objects like a urinal (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(Duchamp)""><em>Fountain</em></a>) or a snow shovel (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Advance_of_the_Broken_Arm""><em>In Advance of the Broken Arm</em></a>) and placing them in a gallery, Duchamp argued that art should <a href=""https://www.thecollector.com/marcel-duchamp-readymades/"">‘serve the mind’ rather than the ‘retinal’ sense</a>. This perspective validates curation as the primary creative act in generative art.</p><figure><img alt=""The sculpture ‘Fountain’ by Marcel Duchamp – a found urinal which the artist signed R. Mutt"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*L2l9k4a1MTGbQRe8lhTQ2Q.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Marcel Duchamp Fountain, 1917, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz</figcaption></figure><p>Sol LeWitt famously extended this in 1967, stating: “The idea becomes a machine that makes the art”. For LeWitt, <a href=""https://infiniteimages.toledomuseum.org/essay/coded-nature"">the execution is a “perfunctory affair”</a>. He often provided loose instructions for <a href=""https://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/"">Wall Drawings</a> that were then executed by assistants. Because the planning and decisions are made beforehand, the artist is free even to surprise himself. This is a verbatim description of generative art, where the prompt acts as the machine that executes the work.</p><figure><img alt=""A picture of ‘Wall Drawing 11’ by Sol LeWitt – it features lines applied to a wall which is divided horizontally and vertically into four equal parts. Within each part, three of the four kinds of lines are superimposed."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/487/1*1EaGFycbyNzUsOuAJ5gtug.jpeg"" /><figcaption><em>Wall Drawing 11</em> by Sol LeWitt — ”A wall divided horizontally and vertically into four equal parts. Within each part, three of the four kinds of lines are superimposed.”</figcaption></figure><p>Yoko Ono’s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapefruit_(book)""><em>Grapefruit</em></a> (1964) furthered this by offering ‘instruction pieces’ that could be realised by anyone in their imagination or as an action. She viewed her work as a “recipe for creating reality,” where the artist relinquishes control to the audience. In this framework, the artist is the architect of a possibility space, a role shared by Joseph Kosuth, whose “<a href=""https://www.moma.org/collection/works/137438"">idea as idea</a>” prioritized the conceptual premise over the physical manifestation.</p><p>The modern AI user who explores the ‘latent space’ of a model is the modern heir to this tradition. However, in outsourcing much of our thinking to machines we risk ‘cognitive atrophy.’ While we may increase efficiency, we may lose the creative trial-and-error, the messy process that is essential to creative growth and identity.</p><h3>The evolutionary remix: jazz, sampling, and the laws of culture</h3><p>A central ethical argument against GenAI is that it ultimately steals from human artists. The training of AI models requires large-scale ingestion of copyrighted material, often without consent or compensation. Critics describe the process as ‘strip-mining’ human expression. From an ethical standpoint, many creators feel that using their life’s work to build a product that might eventually replace them is a fundamental violation of creative rights.</p><p>This assumes that human creativity is <em>ex nihilo</em> (springing from nothingness) rather than being a recursive process of transformation. Kirby Ferguson’s <a href=""https://youtu.be/nJPERZDfyWc?si=OFgCxW97n2QFFKb0""><em>Everything is a Remix</em></a> philosophy argues that all creative work is built on three pillars: Copy, Transform, and Combine.</p><p>This recursive process is visible across various media. In jazz, ‘standards’ serve as a foundational language for musicians to improvise upon, turning popular melodies into exploratory pieces of free jazz. Hip-hop sampling utilizes the ‘copy, transform, combine’ method using turntables and samplers to recontextualize existing beats into new lyrical meanings. Folk music relies on the passing down and <a href=""https://heretakis.medium.com/everything-is-a-remix-the-myth-of-originality-and-the-truth-about-creativity-inspired-by-kirby-94259048fb17"">altering of melodies over generations to evolve cultural narratives</a>.</p><p>The legal landscape in 2025 remains a ‘law unmade.’ While some judges have ruled that AI training is highly transformative and qualifies as fair use, others have rejected this defense when training data is sourced from shadow libraries of pirated books such as LibGen. Futurist Jaron Lanier has proposed ‘<a href=""https://theaiinsider.tech/2025/02/26/vr-pioneer-jaron-lanier-on-data-dignity-and-elevating-human-innovation/"">Data Dignity</a>’ as a solution, a system that moves away from the black-box model to one where the most unique contributors to a model’s output are acknowledged and compensated via data trusts or ‘Mediators of Individual Data’ (MIDs).</p><p>Generative AI represents the digital culmination of a generations-long chain of inheritance. It functions by predicting outcomes based on latent space weights, effectively synthesising billions of artistic ‘quotations’ into a new expression. Roland Barthes’ <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author""><em>Death of the Author</em></a> argued that a text is a “tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centers of culture”. AI models are the most sophisticated intertextual looms ever created; they do not ‘steal’ in the sense of removing an object, but rather presuppose and embed prior expressions into new contexts. The liberation of ‘remix thinking’ frees us from the impossible burden of originality and gives us permission to start where others left off. The question of the legal permission to train and make use of all prior links in the chain of inheritance still remains to be solved for now.</p><h3>The false equivalence: craft vs. art and the amateur’s dilemma</h3><p>A common critique of AI is that it creates a false equivalence between the professional and the amateur. This debate mirrors the historical reaction to photography. Critics in the 19th century argued that photography was a “<a href=""https://daily.jstor.org/when-photography-was-not-art/"">thoughtless mechanism for replication</a>” that lacked the “refined feeling” of a human genius. However, the history of art shows that manual craft does not always equal high art.</p><p>This spectrum of production is well-documented. Bob Ross used an instructional, ‘wet-on-wet’ manual technique to promote a democratic form of craft that, while widely popular, was often excluded from the high art canon. Conversely, Thomas Kinkade utilised an assembly-line factory model where original paintings were digitally transformed into lithographs and ‘enhanced’ by technicians. Kinkade was commercially professional but critically labeled as kitsch.</p><figure><img alt=""A photograph of the tv artist Bob Ross holing a paint palette and brush in front of one of his canvases"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/278/1*yV7-8STcOx4tzhDHj45nrQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Bob Ross at his easel</figcaption></figure><p>Prompt engineering via natural language represents a similar shift. While the tool allows high variance, professional output requires the same iterative curation and historical dialogue used by traditional masters who spent years training to guard their status. The tool does not confer professional status; the consistency and depth of the vision do. AI makes everyone an image generator, but becoming an artist still requires the intellectual labor of curation and thematic depth. GenAI has the ability to uplevel creatives at every level of expertise. Yes, it can enable the novice or amateur but when harnessed by the experienced professional it has the potential to lead us to new and exciting horizons.</p><h3>The unsynthesised truth: synthesisers and the “no bullshit” backlash</h3><p>The musical world offers a direct historical parallel to the visual AI controversy through the introduction of the synthesiser. In the early 1970s, <a href=""https://www.vice.com/en/article/synthesizers-impact-heavy-metal/"">the synthesiser was viewed with intense suspicion by the rock establishment</a>. The band Queen famously included “No Synthesisers” declarations on their album liner notes up until 1980. This was not a rejection of electronic sound itself, but a ‘commitment to the unsynthesized’ intended to prove their ‘technical prowess’ as musicians who could create complex sounds using only guitars and overdubbed vocals.</p><p>Critics of that era, such as those at <em>Melody Maker </em>magazine, often mistook Brian May’s innovative guitar harmonizing for synthesizers. The band used the ‘no synths’ policy as a marketing hook to separate themselves from disco groups and to assert a hierarchy of ‘real’ music over electronic devices.</p><figure><img alt=""A photograph of the liner notes to Queen’s ‘A Night at the Opera’ album. It features a list of performers on the album as well as the disclaimer ‘No Synthesisers!’"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zn3SAEYmk0GhOpn5Jua2Ig.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Liner notes from Queen’s <em>A Night at the Opera</em> album</figcaption></figure><p>However, by the mid-1980s, the ulterior motives of even the staunchest holdouts were revealed. Iron Maiden, who had proclaimed “No synthesisers” on their 1983 album <em>Piece of Mind</em>, heavily embraced guitar synthesisers just three years later on <em>Somewhere in Time</em>. They found that the technology allowed them to explore “conceptual themes such as robotics and artificial intelligence” in a way that traditional instruments could not</p><p>The transition from “no synths” to “synths as standard” highlights the recurring pattern: technology is initially rejected as a ‘detriment to technical prowess,’ then used as a ‘special effect,’ and finally integrated as a ‘more complex musical layer’. Today’s AI tools are in the ‘special effect’ stage, facing the same backlash that once targeted the Moog and the Fairlight CMI.</p><h3>Toward a new synthesis of creative agency</h3><p>The systematically refutable arguments against generative AI in the arts are almost entirely rooted in a misunderstanding of both art history and cognitive bias. When we peel back the layers of Romantic mythology, we find that the history of art is a history of technological integration. Perhaps Vermeer’s genius was his mastery of the camera obscura; Raphael’s genius: his management of a human algorithm; Duchamp’s genius: the conceptual choice that liberated art from the hand.</p><p>Generative AI does not represent a break from this tradition, but its most democratic evolution. By acting as a digital atelier, a conceptual machine, and an intertextual loom, AI allows for an ‘operational elevation’ where humans can focus more on the ‘what’ and the ‘why’ of creation, rather than the ‘how’. Physical craft will not disappear, it may even be elevated in value within this new creative context.</p><p>The future of art is, as it has always been, intelligent and powered by people. The ‘soul’ of the work resides in the intent of the creator, the curation of the expert, and the historical dialogue that no machine can engage in without a human partner. AI is not the end of art; it is the beginning of the most complex atelier in human history, one that requires us to be more human, not less.</p><h3>Further reading from UX Collective</h3><ul><li><a

Velocity is shown as a car moving in a straight line with an arrow, representing motion with direction.

Velocity tells you how fast you’re moving — and in which direction.</strong></p><p>A car travelling at 100 mph in circles has tremendous speed but zero velocity. It goes nowhere. It only burns fuel, overheats the engine, and eventually becomes a hazard to everything nearby.</p><p>As <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Covey"">Stephen Covey</a> put it more bluntly: “Speed is irrelevant if you are going in the wrong direction.”</p><p>Sam Altman reportedly <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2025/12/02/altman-code-red-memo-urges-chatgpt-improvements-amid-growing-threat-from-google-reports-say/"">issued</a> an internal “code red” at OpenAI in December 2025 — an emergency directive to focus resources on improving ChatGPT whilst delaying initiatives like advertising or Pulse triggered by Google’s launch of <a href=""https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/#gemini-3"">Gemini 3</a>. The flagship product that triggered the current AI frenzy, deployed to hundreds of millions of users, needed an internal alarm bell. Not because it had fundamentally failed. But because in the race to stay ahead, the product itself required urgent consolidation before it could bear the weight of continued competition.</p><p>This isn’t an isolated corporate moment. It’s the logical endpoint of what researchers <a href=""https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/njtip/vol18/iss2/1/"">Houser and Raymond</a> identified in their 2021 analysis: an AI race that “lacks definition, a goal, or even an aspirational dream” — yet we keep selling the emotional story of “winning” without ever crossing a finish line.</p><h3><em>Motion</em> is not progress</h3><p>We measure “leadership” in the AI race through release dates, funding rounds, model sizes, benchmark wins. These are metrics of <strong><em>motion</em></strong>, not <strong><em>progress</em></strong>. They tell us who is accelerating — not who is steering.</p><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll"">Lewis Carroll</a> understood the danger: “If you don’t know where you are going, any road will get you there.”</p><p>And when steering disappears, two failures cascade: products become the strategy — you ship because you can, not because you should. <br />And users become raw material — queries as data, confusion as engagement, vulnerability as conversion.</p><p>We’ve seen this pattern before. Facebook’s “move fast and break things” contributed to outcomes such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal"">Cambridge Analytica</a>, the amplification of ethnic violence in <a href=""https://systemicjustice.org/article/facebook-and-genocide-how-facebook-contributed-to-genocide-in-myanmar-and-why-it-will-not-be-held-accountable/"">Myanmar</a>, <a href=""https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/news/the-myth-of-metas-free-speech-places-democracy-at-risk/"">algorithmic radicalisation</a>. The company <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-on-facebooks-new-motto-2014-5"">changed</a> its motto — but only after harming democracies. That’s speed without velocity: motion that creates value for shareholders whilst externalising catastrophic harm onto societies.</p><p>The advertising rumours around OpenAI matter not as scandal, but as signal. When a product loses strategic clarity, monetisation stops being a consequence of direction and becomes a substitute for it. This is profitable aimlessness.</p><h3>The speed trap</h3><p>The real divide between the United States and Europe is no longer “regulation versus innovation.” It is <strong>speed versus velocity</strong>.</p><p>America has chosen speed. Deploy faster, scale bigger, monetise quicker. Ask forgiveness later — if anyone is still empowered to ask. This is innovation as extraction: build, break, capture, repeat. Humans become datasets. Long-term damage becomes acceptable externality. Consent becomes a legal checkbox rather than an ethical foundation.</p><p>Europe has chosen velocity. Not mere movement, but movement <em>towards something</em>: a society where rights don’t evaporate when a model improves, where consent is not a checkbox, where accountability has a name, a process, and an enforcement mechanism.</p><p>Europe isn’t slow. Europe is choosing direction.</p><p>Critics argue — rightly so — that European regulation has slowed deployment. That whilst Brussels debated AI Act provisions, Silicon Valley shipped products to hundreds of millions of users. That market leadership matters, and hesitation costs.</p><p>True. But incomplete.</p><p>Because the question isn’t “who shipped first?” It’s “who shipped something that can scale without collapsing and who can articulate why it needed to exist at all?” <br />Speed means nothing if you cannot answer what problem you’re solving.</p><p>The OpenAI code red memo is an existence proof: shipping fast doesn’t guarantee shipping well. And when trust collapses, market leadership becomes a liability, not an asset.</p><p>The GDPR didn’t slow European innovation — it prevented European companies from building on foundations of exploited data that would later crumble. <br />The AI Act isn’t delaying deployment — it’s preventing deployment of systems that would later require expensive retrofitting or complete abandonment.</p><p>Europe isn’t slow. Europe is avoiding the expensive mistake of building systems that cannot scale with trust.</p><h3>Guardrails are compasses</h3><p>The European regulatory framework is doing something more sophisticated than restriction. It is building infrastructure.</p><p><a href=""https://gdpr-info.eu/"">GDPR</a> doesn’t prohibit data usage — it demands transparency: what you collect, why you collect it, how long you keep it, who you share it with, and what rights people retain. That is not restriction. That is direction.</p><p>The <a href=""https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/"">AI Act</a> doesn’t ban artificial intelligence — it categorises AI systems by risk level and mandates transparency, human oversight, and accountability proportional to potential harm. High-risk systems affecting employment, education, healthcare, law enforcement must meet minimum standards before deployment. This is infrastructure for trust.</p><p>The <a href=""https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-act"">Data Act </a>ensures that data generated by connected devices remains accessible to users and can be shared across services, preventing monopolistic data hoarding. It creates foundations for competitive markets and genuine user agency.</p><p>But the real power of European regulation lies not in what it prohibits, but in what it insists upon:</p><p><strong>1. Accountability means someone can answer when things go wrong.</strong> Not “the algorithm decided.” Not “the model optimised for engagement.” But a named human being who can explain the logic, justify the outcome, and bear responsibility for the consequences.</p><p><strong>2. Transparency means systems can be understood.</strong> Not just by engineers who built them, but by citizens affected by them. If we cannot understand how decisions are made, we cannot contest them. And if we cannot contest them, we have abdicated governance to machines that cannot be held responsible.</p><p><strong>3. Responsibility means consequences attach to choices.</strong> When an AI system fails, when it discriminates, when it causes harm — there is a legal pathway for redress. This is the foundation that allows innovation to scale with trust rather than collapse under its own externalities.</p><p>Consider <a href=""https://e-estonia.com/estonia-and-automated-decision-making-challenges-for-public-administration/"">Estonia’s</a> digital governance <a href=""https://loti.london/blog/estonia-insights/"">framework</a>. Every government algorithm that touches citizen data requires human approval, logging, and audit trails. The result? One of the world’s most digitalised societies — and one of the most trusted. Speed of deployment matched by clarity of accountability.</p><p>Or think about the <a href=""https://iapp.org/news/a/digital-welfare-fraud-detection-and-the-dutch-syri-judgment"">Netherlands</a>’ court ruling against the government’s welfare fraud detection algorithm. The <a href=""https://www.asser.nl/news/interview-curtailing-the-surveillance-state-anticipating-the-syri-case-judgment"">system</a> was fast, efficient, and… discriminatory. The court demanded transparency and accountability. The ruling didn’t stop innovation. It redirected it towards systems citizens could actually trust.</p><p>This is velocity: movement with direction, protected by accountability.</p><h3>The race makes cooperation impossible</h3><p>Here is the danger that few acknowledge: <strong>the race narrative makes global cooperation impossible.</strong></p><p>Not difficult. Not unlikely. Structurally incompatible<em>.</em></p><p>When nations frame AI development as existential competition, every shared standard becomes potential weakness. Every regulatory alignment becomes strategic vulnerability. Every moment of cooperation risks exploitation by adversaries who might be moving faster in the shadows.</p><p>As Houser and Raymond observed: an AI race can keep selling the emotional story of “winning” without ever crossing a finish line. The race narrative fractures the possibility of building AI systems grounded in shared values, mutual accountability, and collective benefit.</p><p>Without cooperation, we do not get faster innovation. We get incompatible systems, fragmented standards, and a technological landscape where human rights are jurisdiction-dependent accidents rather than universal guarantees. We get a world where the same AI system can respect privacy in Brussels, ignore it in San Francisco, and weaponise it in Beijing.</p><p><strong>The future of AI depends on cooperation, infrastructure, and uniform standards</strong> — on shared definitions of harm, shared accountability mechanisms, shared ethical foundations. But velocity requires shared bearings. Speed doesn’t. Speed just requires a competitor.</p><p>This is not speculation. This is happening now. And the window for choosing differently is closing.</p><h3>The architecture of endurance</h3><p>The Renaissance was not built in haste. It was intentional. European cathedrals took generations to complete. Their builders knew they would not see the finished work. Yet they built with precision, with vision, with responsibility to those who would inherit what they created. Ideas were allowed to mature. Beauty was given time to emerge. Architecture was designed for endurance, not obsolescence.</p><p>Contrast this with structures built for speed: temporary, disposable, optimised for immediate utility. They served the moment. Then vanished, leaving nothing worth preserving.</p><p>We face this choice now. Build fast and disposable, or build to last. Optimise for quarterly returns, or generational impact. Compete for market share, or create foundations worth inheriting.</p><p>Europe remembers this lesson. America seems determined to forget it.</p><h3><strong>Choosing direction</strong></h3><p>If you are responsible for AI strategy, governance, or risk management, velocity requires three shifts:</p><p><strong>First, reframe your metrics.</strong> Speed metrics — deployment velocity, time-to-market, model performance — must be balanced by direction metrics: clarity of purpose, user safety outcomes, accountability pathways. If you cannot measure direction, you cannot manage it.</p><p><strong>Second, build </strong><a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/when-deepware-meets-wetware-the-uncomfortable-truth-about-responsible-ai-245842121749""><strong>accountability</strong></a><strong> chains.</strong> Every AI system needs a named human who can explain, justify, and take responsibility for its decisions. If you cannot identify that person, you cannot deploy the system responsibly. These chains cannot be retrofitted — they must be designed from day one. There’s an old IBM memo from 1979 worth remembering: “<em>A computer can never be held accountable. Therefore a computer must never make a management decision</em>.”</p><p><strong>Third, treat compliance as architecture.</strong> European regulations aren’t restrictions to work around — they’re scaffolding for building systems that can scale globally. If your system can meet GDPR and AI Act requirements, it can operate anywhere. If it cannot, you’re building for a fragmenting market.</p><p>The organisations that understand this now will have structural advantages when markets consolidate around trustworthy systems.</p><h3>Beyond the finish line</h3><p>The choice isn’t “Europe versus America.” That’s the race story trying to recruit you.</p><p>The choice is speed without accountability, or velocity with direction.</p><p>Europe’s bet: innovation scales only when trust scales with it. Real progress requires more than computational power — it demands wisdom.</p><p><a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmddnge9yro"">America’s</a> bet: trust can be retrofitted later. Speed creates its own legitimacy. Winning justifies the means.</p><p>The code red memo is what it looks like when “later” arrives.</p><p>Every algorithm, every neural network carries within it the echoes of human decision-making. Our challenge is not to fear these technologies, but to consciously shape their ethical foundations. Our deepest innovations emerge not from machines, but from the human capacity to reimagine possibility.</p><p>The question before us is whether we’ll exercise that capacity — or surrender it to the illusion that speed equals progress.</p><p><strong><em>Author’s Note:</em></strong><em> The thinking, research, and arguments in this article are entirely human.

<h3>AI will kill most startups — and that’s a good thing</h3><h4>When anyone can build the product, only authority differentiates the outcome.</h4><figure><img alt=""Close-up of a computer keyboard with “COPY” and “PASTE” written on large keys, symbolizing digital duplication. The tone is straightforward and technical."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_ED9TlTScNeTb0W2Rdh1Sg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Image source: Adobe Stock</figcaption></figure><p>Picture an ordinary person working in tech — a designer, developer, or product manager — who stumbles onto a genuinely good idea. Not a moonshot. Not a revolution. Just something that solves a real problem.</p><p>In the past, bringing that idea to life required capital, a team, and time. Today, it requires a laptop and a collection of AI tools. With AI filling the gaps, a working prototype can be <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/vibe-coding"">vibe coded</a> in weeks, if not hours. The product is tested, refined, and launched, and for a brief moment it appears successful.</p><p>Then reality intervenes.</p><p>Within months, near-identical products emerge, <a href=""https://medium.com/@skooloflife/99-of-ai-startups-will-be-dead-by-2026-heres-why-bfc974edd968"">copied and shipped at machine speed</a>. What began as a solo effort quickly becomes a crowded category, and any early differentiation disappears. Soon after, a large technology company notices the pattern. Without meaningful distribution or a loyal audience to defend it, <a href=""https://www.webpronews.com/perplexity-ceo-big-tech-will-copy-ai-startups/"">the idea is absorbed into an existing platform as a feature</a>. A few months later, the startup is effectively gone.</p><p><a href=""https://futurism.com/future-society/ai-startups-vibe-coding"">This outcome is no longer unusual. It is becoming the norm.</a></p><p>What this reveals is uncomfortable but important. AI does not kill startups. It exposes ideas that never earned credibility. If a product can be imagined, built, and shipped by almost anyone, it can also be copied by almost anyone. That is not a failure of innovation so much as a stress test — one that reveals how thin many ideas were to begin with.</p><p>I saw this firsthand early in my career.</p><p>My first startup experience was at a publishing company building a new journal and news platform for <a href=""https://jadpro.com/"">advanced practitioners in oncology</a>. On paper, it was an extremely narrow niche. But the niche alone was not what made the product work. Plenty of people could have identified the same market and built a similar platform.</p><p>During that time, I watched multiple medical-content startups with solid ideas fail, even though the problems they were trying to solve were real and obvious.</p><p>We had a well-established advanced practitioner in oncology serving as editor-in-chief — someone deeply respected in the field, with years of lived experience and professional trust behind their name. That changed everything. It shaped how the content was framed, how the platform was perceived, and whether practitioners were willing to engage with it at all.</p><p>What mattered was credibility.</p><p>The product succeeded not simply because it existed, but because people trusted who it came from. That distinction is where many modern startups will fail. AI makes it easy to build products—it does nothing to establish why anyone should trust them.</p><p>What will survive in this new AI environment are <a href=""https://productify.substack.com/p/the-complete-guide-to-product-moats"">products with real moats</a>. And a moat is not clever functionality, a polished interface, or speed to market. It is whatever does not collapse under replication — distribution, trust, proprietary data, embedded workflows, regulatory friction. AI has a way of <a href=""https://strategeos.com/blog/f/defensive-moats-in-the-age-of-llms-when-ai-commoditizes-your-ip?blogcategory=Business+Consulting"">stripping away the illusion</a> and revealing which products actually possess these advantages.</p><p>This dynamic feels brutal, but it is ultimately corrective. AI eliminates products that existed largely because building used to be hard. In doing so, it creates space for work rooted in context, relationships, and accumulated judgment. The bar has not necessarily been raised — it has been clarified.</p><p>Some of the most durable moats are not technical at all. They are human. Trust earned over time. Expertise in a narrow, underexplored domain. Lived experience that shapes how a problem is understood. Perspective refined through accountability. Features can be copied. Credibility cannot.</p><p>AI excels at reproducing outputs. It struggles to reproduce identity, reputation, and judgment. Products that are extensions of who someone is, rather than just what they have built, are far harder to erase.</p><p>So what does a viable strategy actually look like?</p><p>It is not building faster, shipping more features, or out-executing competitors. AI has already neutralized those advantages. Competing on speed or efficiency is no longer a strategy when <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2024/02/07/as-ai-rapidly-becomes-a-commodity-time-to-consider-the-next-step/"">execution itself has been commoditized</a>.</p><p>The real shift happens upstream. Founders must stop asking what they can build and start asking what they are uniquely positioned to justify. That justification does not come from novelty. It comes from credibility accumulated long before the product exists. From being embedded in a domain deeply enough that the solution reflects judgment, not just capability.</p><p>In practice, this means fewer generic products and more opinionated ones. Products that make tradeoffs. Products shaped by experience rather than tooling. AI can help build them, but it cannot supply the authority behind them.</p><p>It also means that trust, reputation, and distribution are no longer problems to solve after launch. They are part of the product itself. If an idea can be detached from its creator and absorbed by a platform without resistance, it was never defensible to begin with.</p><p>The startups that survive this era of AI will not look like traditional startups. They will resemble institutions, disciplines, or professions — things with continuity, authority, and accountability. Their advantage will not be speed. It will be standing.</p><p>AI is not ending startups. It is forcing them to justify their existence. That correction, however uncomfortable, is overdue.</p><p><strong><em>Don’t miss out! </em></strong><a href=""https://micbuckcreative.medium.com/subscribe""><strong><em>Join my email list</em></strong></a><strong><em> and receive the latest content.</em></strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=73dbd8198825"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/ai-will-kill-most-startups-and-thats-a-good-thing-73dbd8198825"">AI will kill most startups — and that’s a good thing</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Leveraging AI-driven exploration to build stronger, clearer product specifications</h4><figure><img alt=""The image depicts a collaborative workshop where a woman gestures toward an AI “Spec Brief Coach” on a laptop while a colleague reviews a “Provocative” prototype variation on a tablet. The workspace is scattered with sticky notes for “Vibe Coding” and “CUJs,” alongside a background note reflecting the goal that every digital workshop board should become a persistent AI Gem."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WASSXH85BShj6FpOXhx_3Q.png"" /><figcaption>Generated by Nano Banana Pro based on the article.</figcaption></figure><p>It can be tempting to think our job as Product Managers is to provide the team with absolute certainty. We want the “perfect” plan before we share it. But if you’ve ever felt like a blank page was staring back at you, you know that absolute clarity is often the enemy of a great idea.</p><p>I recently ran a workshop called <strong>“Writing Clear Requirements for Humans and AI”</strong> that explored a different path: using “Vibe Coding” (rapid prototyping) not to build a final product, but to explore the messy, conceptual space where the best ideas live.</p><p>Here is how you can use three specific Gemini Gems to move from a vague “vibe” to a battle-tested requirement.</p><h3>1. Embrace the “Just Enough Confusion”</h3><p>In a recent post, I wrote about how <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/creativity-requires-just-enough-confusion-eecb6c720130"">creativity requires just enough confusion</a> to actually work. We need to be a little surprised to find something new.</p><p>Vibe coding for PMs is exactly that. It isn’t about becoming an engineer; it’s about making your thinking much stronger earlier in the process. It’s about “rubber ducking” your decisions, externalizing your thinking so you can look at it in a more objective way, with a machine before you bring it to your team.</p><p>Instead of staring at a template, start with the <a href=""https://gemini.google.com/gem/1y8nq4XH7FCB3dj-nY4wp0vZDD4TZd5_a?usp=sharing""><strong>Spec Brief Coach</strong></a>. This Gem acts like a consultant, interviewing you to extract the “what” and “why” of your project.</p><ul><li><strong>Step-by-Step:</strong> It guides you through sections like Goals, Critical User Journeys (CUJs), and “Moments That Matter” — those key points of high emotion where the experience is won or lost.</li><li><strong>Fill the Gaps:</strong> If you’re stuck, it can even suggest content to help spark your thinking.</li><li><strong>The Artifact:</strong> You end up with a structured markdown spec that serves as the “context” for everything else you do.</li></ul><h3>2. The Power of the “Bad” Idea</h3><p>We usually try to hide our bad ideas. But in the exploration phase, a “bad” idea is a gift because it helps you define what is actually good.</p><p>The <a href=""https://gemini.google.com/gem/1MwUzwm6OMCFNhd9SFdulMImqsV4IwcvU?usp=sharing""><strong>Spec Variation Tool</strong></a> takes your initial spec and generates four different ways to realize it to open the aperture of what you are considering.</p><ul><li><strong>Variation Axes:</strong> It tests different assumptions by varying factors like automation levels or interaction paradigms.</li><li><strong>The Provocative Spec:</strong> One of these is intentionally a “provocative” or “bad” version designed to highlight anti-patterns and what <em>not</em> to do.</li><li><strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong> By quickly prototyping these in tools like Google AI Studio, you can see where a concept falls apart. This helps broaden the aperture of exploration rather than just meandering through a single conversation.</li></ul><h3>3. Stress-Testing with a “Rude Engineer”</h3><p>You don’t want the first person to find a flaw in your logic to be your VP during a review. You want to find it yourself, in the privacy of your own AI chat.</p><p>The <a href=""https://gemini.google.com/gem/1xWCiskHjI_wyXtHdIRIGvKq4FlMwYUqp?usp=sharing""><strong>Viewpoint Simulator</strong></a> pressure-tests your spec from multiple, highly biased perspectives.</p><ul><li><strong>The Panel:</strong> It simulates voices like a Product Designer, a Privacy Expert, and even a “Rude Senior Engineer”.</li><li><strong>The Benefit:</strong> The “Rude Engineer” is blunt and skeptical about ambiguity or over-engineering. Because it’s a machine, the feedback isn’t personal. It’s just a tool to help you find your own blind spots.</li></ul><h3>The Future: From Static Boards to “Living” Gems</h3><p>One of the most exciting shifts I’ve been thinking about is the change in how we workshop. We’ve all seen Miro boards full of sticky notes that never get looked at again.</p><p>I believe every Miro should be a Gem. The future of workshopping is a system that collects and keeps distributed context up to date. This allows us to distribute context not only about how to do the workshop later but notes from the workshop itself can become distributed context to be used when needed. Almost like a workbench to create future docs based on everything discussed so far.</p><p>Instead of a static summary, we need a system that creates constantly updated drafts or “views” for different stakeholders, whether that’s for engineering, design, or legal review. This system of drafts is always in flux as the context is updated, we learn new things, and we make hard decisions.</p><h3>Conclusion: Taking it Back to the Team</h3><p>Prototypes and specs are both necessary conversation pieces. The prototype gives the “vibe,” but the spec captures the complexity and nuance that a prototype alone cannot.</p><p>When you take these artifacts back to your team, here are the next steps to keep in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Set Clear Expectations:</strong> Make it crystal clear that these prototypes are tests to aid in decisions, not the final product to be built.</li><li><strong>Use Tools Live:</strong> Try using these Gems live in meetings. Hearing how an engineer or designer interprets the AI’s feedback can spark valuable discussions.</li><li><strong>Don’t Replace, Collaborate:</strong> These tools aren’t meant to replace designers or engineers; they are meant to spark discussion. Use them to say, “Here is what I care about; here is some stuff to look at if it’s helpful”.</li><li><strong>Keep a Decision Log:</strong> Document what you decided <em>not</em> to do. This path of exploration helps others understand exactly how you arrived at your final direction.</li><li><strong>Help Write Agent Specs:</strong> PMs can better integrate into the development process by helping write the specs that AI agents will use to do work.</li></ul><p>Next time you’re starting something new, don’t aim for immediate clarity. Use these Gems to find that “just enough confusion” that leads to a breakthrough.</p><p><em>This article was crafted by the author, with help from Gemini, which drew from the author’s engaging workshop transcript and related materials.</em></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=11faeedb5274"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-pms-can-vibe-code-to-build-stronger-requirements-11faeedb5274"">How PMs can vibe code to build stronger requirements</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11922291.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings, we’ve made it to January 2026. And this isn’t just another new year…it’s a true reset. Numerologically, 2026 adds up to a 1, the number of beginnings, initiation, and fresh cycles. On a collective level, this is the kind of year astrologers talk about decades later. Saturn and Neptune both re-enter Aries this year — Saturn for two years, Neptune for over a decade. Aries is the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">very first sign of the zodiac</a>. This is the ignition point. The spark. And by February, we’ll also enter the Year of the Fire Horse, amplifying this sense that something powerful is waking up in the collective.</p>



<p>But here’s the thing: this doesn’t automatically make 2026 “easy.” It makes it <em>potent</em>. Saturn is in the final moments of wrapping its long journey through Pisces, the final sign of the zodiac. That means every sign has completed a wisdom initiation. We’ve all been stretched, softened, disillusioned, and re-sensitized over the last few years. Even if things still look chaotic (and yes, they are — Uranus remains in Taurus until July, and Pluto is only just settling into Aquarius for its 20-year stay), what’s actually happening is a massive soil-turning. Old systems are breaking down so something more fertile, more alive, and more sustainable can grow.</p>



<p>That’s why one of the biggest themes of January, and honestly, all of 2026, is<em> tending to your own garden.</em> Focus your energy where it can actually grow something. This January begins emotionally, intentionally, and intuitively with the Cancer New Moon on January 3rd, a powerful culmination of everything we processed in the last six months of 2025. That chapter taught us that even our pain can be transmuted into power. It’s a tender, feeling-forward start to the year — one that invites us to listen more deeply to our intuition instead of overriding it.</p>



<p>At the same time, we’re firmly in Capricorn Season until January 19th, with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars in Capricorn</a> for most of the month and Venus also moving through Capricorn. This grounds all that emotion into something practical. Every zodiac sign is being asked the same question: <em>What actually matters?</em> Financially, this is a strong month for getting yourself together: reviewing your budget, canceling subscriptions you don’t use, and daring to plan the next quarter from abundance rather than scarcity. This is boss energy, but the mature kind. The kind that builds something that lasts.</p>



<p>There’s also a noticeable shift in our collective healing story. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Chiron retrograde ends this month</a>, and that matters. The healing journey we’ve all been on isn’t disappearing… it’s becoming lighter, more creative, more joy-oriented. Healing doesn’t have to be endless excavation. It can be playful. It can be life-giving. And you’ll feel that shift early in the year.</p>



<p>Mid-month, the energy begins to pivot outward. Venus enters Aquarius on January 17th, reminding us that while Capricorn Season may have had us focused on survival and structure, we’re not meant to do this alone. Community matters — but Saturn has taught us discernment. Not everyone gets access to you. Venus in Aquarius isn’t about small talk or performative connection. It’s about people you can build new worlds with. Mutual care, mutual vision, mutual respect.</p>



<p>Then comes the full Aquarius activation. The sun enters Aquarius on January 19th, Mercury follows on January 20th, and Mars enters Aquarius on January 23rd. This is a powerful stellium for community-building, collective dreaming, and unconventional collaboration. If you’ve been thinking about starting a co-op, a startup, a mutual aid project, a community garden — this is your cosmic green light. The weirder, more innovative, and more future-focused, the better. This energy is preparing us for the Aquarius eclipse coming in February, which will further accelerate collective shifts toward equity and shared power. We’re already seeing the ripple effects of this Aquarius momentum worldwide, as communities demand systems that actually serve people.</p>



<p>And just when you think January couldn’t get any more electric, Neptune enters Aries on January 26th. This is huge. Neptune, the planet of dreams, ideals, and imagination, forming supportive connections with Mars and Mercury in Aquarius brings inspired action online. Vision meets movement and hope meets strategy.</p>



<p>Yes, Aquarius energy can bring stubbornness or power struggles if ego gets involved, but the deeper message of this month is simple and radical: <em>you don’t have to do everything alone anymore</em>. January asks us to breathe more easily, to let support circulate, and to extend that same relief to others — especially those with less access or privilege. That’s the real beginning. And that’s what makes this one of the most meaningful fresh starts of our lifetimes.  </p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, January opens on an emotional note with the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, illuminating your home, family, and inner foundation. This is a deeply personal reset. You may feel more sensitive than usual, nostalgic even, as memories, family dynamics, or questions about where (and with whom) you truly feel safe come to the surface. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-new-moon-in-sagittarius-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">This Full Moon</a> asks you to tend to your roots before charging ahead. You’re starting the year by acknowledging that strength doesn’t come from constant motion… it comes from having somewhere solid to land. Give yourself permission to feel it all, especially if the past six months stirred up emotions you didn’t have time to fully process.</p>



<p>At the same time, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars remains in Capricorn</a> for most of the month, activating your career, reputation, and long-term legacy sector. This creates an interesting contrast: emotional sensitivity at home, paired with serious ambition in public. You’re being asked to grow up in some way professionally: to take your goals more seriously, even if that means making tough, disciplined choices. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is especially potent for setting intentions around your work life, leadership, and the mark you want to leave behind. This is about playing the long game. You’re not just chasing success, you’re defining what success actually means to you.</p>



<p>Then the energy shifts noticeably. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars entering Aquarius on the 23rd, moving your focus from individual achievement to collective impact. Suddenly, you’re energized by community, technology, collaboration, and future-facing ideas. You may feel called to host, organize, share your insights, or step into a more visible role within a group or network.</p>



<p>And just days later, Neptune enters your sign on January 26th, where it will remain for over a decade. This is huge. It marks the beginning of a new era of dreaming, creating, and becoming for you. Your intuition sharpens, your imagination expands, and your presence becomes magnetic. This is your time to shine — not by shrinking yourself to fit expectations, but by fully embodying the bold, visionary, brilliant Aries you were born to be. The dreams you begin to believe in now have the power to become real.  </p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831459.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, January begins with the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your communication, learning, and creative expression sector. This is a moment of culmination tied to the last six months, especially around how you speak up, share your ideas, write, teach, or tell your story. Conversations may come full circle, a message finally lands, or you realize how much your voice has evolved since mid-2025. At the start of the year, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-new-moon-in-sagittarius-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this Full Moon</a> invites you to honor your growth as a communicator and to trust that your words actually carry weight now. You’re not just talking… you’re transmitting something meaningful.</p>



<p>In the background, Mars moves steadily through Capricorn for most of the month, energizing your sector of higher learning, philosophy, long-distance travel, and big-picture thinking. This is productive, purposeful fire. You may feel motivated to commit to a course, apply for something abroad, plan a meaningful trip, or finally take an idea seriously that once felt too far off or impractical. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is especially supportive for setting intentions around expansion that’s sustainable; travel with purpose, learning that leads somewhere, or spiritual growth that’s actually integrated into daily life. This isn’t escapism; it’s evolution.</p>



<p>Then the tone shifts dramatically in the final third of the month. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, lighting up your career, public image, and long-term direction. Suddenly, visibility increases. People notice you. Opportunities arise that ask you to step up or stand out in a new way — especially through innovation, leadership, or unconventional paths. At the same time, Neptune enters Aries on January 26th, activating your spirituality, healing, and subconscious realm. The magic of this month is learning how to merge both: ambition <em>and</em> inner alignment. You’re being asked to build a life that honors your calling without abandoning your soul. It’s an exciting shift… one that reminds you that success hits different when it’s rooted in meaning. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831461.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, January begins with the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your money, values, and self-worth sector. This is a culmination tied to the last six months around income, stability, and how you value your time, energy, and talents. You may receive clarity around what’s sustainable and what’s draining you financially or energetically. At the very start of the year, this Full Moon asks you to get emotionally honest about security — not just what you earn, but what actually makes you feel safe. There’s a strong message here: your worth is no longer negotiable.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars spends most of January in Capricorn</a>, moving through your sector of shared resources, debts, investments, and deep emotional entanglements. This is intense but productive energy. You may be actively restructuring finances that involve other people: taxes, loans, inheritances, subscriptions, or business partnerships. Emotionally, this can also stir up questions about trust, power, and reciprocity. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is an ideal moment to set intentions around financial cleanup, long-term investments, or releasing attachments that feel too heavy to carry into this new cycle. This is about taking responsibility for your future… not fearfully, but strategically.</p>



<p>The final third of the month brings a noticeable lift. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, with Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, activating your sector of higher learning, travel, publishing, and expanded perspective. Your curiosity reignites. You may feel pulled toward teaching, studying, sharing your ideas publicly, or planning a trip that changes how you see the world.</p>



<p>Then, Neptune enters Aries on January 26th, illuminating your community, friendships, and long-term dreams for the next decade. This is where hope returns. You’re reminded that you don’t have to figure everything out alone… your people, your collaborators, your future allies are finding you. January ultimately shifts you from survival mode into vision mode. And that’s a powerful way to begin a year of one.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831462.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, January is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/being-boring-is-good"">your personal reset</a>. Your annual New Moon arrives early, on January 3rd, in your sign, marking one of the most important moments of your entire year. This is a rebirth point, emotionally, energetically, and intuitively. The past six months have likely asked you to release old identities, patterns, or versions of yourself that no longer felt safe or true. Now, you get to choose who you’re becoming. You may feel more sensitive, reflective, or inward at the start of the year, but that’s because your intuition is loud and clear. This New Moon asks you to trust your instincts and set intentions that honor <em>how you want to feel</em>, not just what you want to achieve.</p>



<p>At the same time, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars spends most of January in Capricorn</a>, directly opposing your sign and activating your partnership sector. Relationships — romantic, professional, and personal — are front and center. This can bring clarity around commitment, boundaries, and shared responsibility. You may be asked to meet others halfway, even if that feels uncomfortable at first. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th deepens this theme, offering a moment to reset agreements, redefine expectations, or make a serious decision about who you’re building with long-term. This is about choosing relationships that can support the version of you that’s emerging now.</p>



<p>The energy lightens and expands in the final third of the month. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, shifting your focus toward intimacy, healing, and shared resources. You’re encouraged to have honest conversations about money, trust, and emotional exchange. Then, on January 26th, Neptune enters Aries, beginning a long-term chapter in your career and public life. Over the next decade, you’re learning how to align your work with your intuition and compassion. January ends by reminding you that when you honor your emotional truth, you don’t just feel safer… you become more powerful. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831463.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, January begins quietly with the Cancer New Moon on January 3rd, activating your sector of rest, healing, and subconscious processing. This is not your usual spotlight moment… and that’s intentional. The start of the year invites you to slow down, go inward, and release emotional weight you’ve been carrying since mid-2025. You may feel more introspective, more tired, or more aware of what needs to end rather than begin. This New Moon is about closure, forgiveness, and making peace with the past so you don’t drag it into the next chapter. Think of it as energetic decluttering before the glow up.</p>



<p>At the same time, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars moves through Capricorn</a> for most of the month, activating your work, health, and daily routine sector. While emotionally you’re in a reflective space, practically you’re being asked to get your life together. This is prime energy for committing to healthier habits, refining your schedule, or taking your responsibilities more seriously, especially if you’ve been running on autopilot. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th offers a powerful moment to reset your routines and make sustainable changes that support your long-term vitality. Small shifts now can have major ripple effects.</p>



<p>The energy shifts dramatically in the final third of the month. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, activating your partnership sector. Suddenly, other people matter more, romantically, creatively, and professionally. Conversations get real, and decisions about commitment, collaboration, or boundaries come into focus. And then, Neptune enters Aries on January 26th, opening a long-term chapter of spiritual growth, faith, and expanded perspective. January ends by reminding you that rest is not a retreat… it’s preparation. You’re clearing space so <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/being-boring-is-good"">your next era</a> can arrive fully formed.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831464.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, January opens with the Cancer New Moon on January 3rd, activating your sector of friendships, community, and long-term goals. This marks a meaningful culmination connected to the last six months, especially around who you’ve been building with and which dreams are still worth your energy. You may feel a shift in your social circle, a renewed sense of belonging, or clarity about which visions you want to commit to in this new cycle. At the start of the year, this New Moon asks you to stop doing everything alone and to trust that aligned support exists.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars spends most of the month in Capricorn</a>, moving through your creativity, romance, and passion sector. This is productive, focused fire… less about fantasy, more about commitment. You’re being encouraged to take something you love seriously, whether that’s a creative project, a romantic connection, or your relationship with joy itself. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is especially potent for setting intentions around pleasure that’s sustainable, creative work that has structure, or dating with clearer standards. This is about showing up consistently for what lights you up.</p>



<p>The final third of the month brings a noticeable pivot. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, shifting your attention to work, wellness, and daily systems. You may feel motivated to streamline your schedule, adopt new tools or technologies, or rethink how you manage your time and energy.</p>



<p>Then, Neptune enters Aries on January 26th, beginning a long-term chapter of emotional healing and deeper intimacy. January ends by reminding you that when your routines support your passions — and your boundaries support your heart — you don’t just function better, you thrive.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831465.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, January begins with the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, spotlighting your career, visibility, and public life. This is a culmination moment connected to the last six months of effort, especially around leadership, recognition, or a role you’ve been growing into since mid-2025. You may receive feedback, validation, or clarity about where you stand professionally and what no longer feels emotionally sustainable. Starting the year this way can feel intense, but it’s also empowering. You’re being asked to define success on your own terms, not just perform it for others.</p>



<p>At the same time, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars moves through Capricorn</a> for most of the month, activating your home, family, and inner foundation sector. While your outer life is visible, your inner life is under construction. You may be dealing with family responsibilities, a move, home projects, or emotional patterns rooted in the past. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is a powerful reset point for your private world, setting intentions around stability, boundaries with family, or creating a living situation that actually supports your nervous system. This is about building a base that can hold you as your ambitions grow.</p>



<p>The final third of the month brings a shift toward joy and connection.

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, January opens with the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, illuminating your sector of belief, higher learning, travel, and meaning. This is a culmination tied to the last six months of growth around your worldview: what you believe, what you stand for, and what feels worth your devotion. You may have a realization that changes how you see your future, or you could finally release an old philosophy, plan, or story that no longer fits who you’re becoming. Starting the year this way feels expansive and emotional at once. You’re being reminded that growth isn’t just about doing more… it’s about aligning with a truth that actually sustains you.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars spends most of January in Capricorn</a>, activating your communication, thinking, and daily movement sector. This is sharp, productive energy for writing, speaking, teaching, negotiating, or making concrete plans. Your mind is focused, strategic, and direct. Conversations carry weight now, especially ones you may have been avoiding. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is a powerful moment to set intentions around how you communicate, what you commit to mentally, and how you manage your time and energy day to day. This is about discipline in thought, not obsession — choosing clarity over noise.</p>



<p>The final third of the month brings an inward but grounding shift. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, activating your home, family, and emotional foundation. You may feel called to reorganize your space, redefine family dynamics, or spend more time nesting and grounding yourself.</p>



<p>Then, Neptune enters Aries on January 26th, beginning a long-term chapter of healing through work, wellness, and daily rituals. Over the next decade, your relationship with your body, your labor, and your purpose evolves in a more intuitive, compassionate direction.

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, January begins with the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your sector of intimacy, shared resources, and energetic exchange. This is a culmination tied to the last six months around trust: who you merge with emotionally, financially, or spiritually, and where power dynamics have needed healing. You may gain clarity around a financial arrangement, a deep relationship, or an emotional attachment that’s ready to transform. Starting the year this way can feel intense, but it’s also clarifying. You’re learning that vulnerability isn’t a loss of freedom… it’s a different kind of strength.</p>



<p>At the same time, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars moves through Capricorn</a> for most of the month, grounding your focus in money, self-worth, and material stability. This is about taking responsibility for your resources and recognizing your value in very real, tangible ways. You may feel motivated to increase income, tighten your budget, or commit to a long-term financial plan that supports your independence. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is especially powerful for setting intentions around earnings, pricing your work fairly, or building security without sacrificing joy. This is practical ambition that actually supports your freedom.</p>



<p>The energy lightens and speeds up in the final third of the month. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, activating your communication, learning, and local connection sector. Conversations spark ideas. Writing, teaching, pitching, or sharing your perspective feels energizing again.</p>



<p>Then, Neptune enters Aries on January 26th, beginning a long-term chapter of creative and romantic awakening. Over the next decade, joy becomes more intuitive, love more inspired, and creativity more fearless.

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, January begins with the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your partnership sector and bringing relationship themes front and center. This is a culmination tied to the last six months around commitment, collaboration, and emotional reciprocity. You may receive clarity about who’s truly showing up for you, and where imbalance has lingered too long. Starting the year this way asks you to soften without losing your edge. This Full Moon reminds you that strength doesn’t mean carrying everything alone; it means choosing connections that meet you in the middle.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mars spends most of January in your sign, giving you drive, momentum, and a sense of personal authority that’s hard to ignore. You’re more decisive, more visible, and more willing to take up space. This is a powerful time to initiate personal goals, redefine your identity, or step into leadership in a way that feels embodied rather than forced. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is especially important for you — it’s a personal reset. Set intentions around how you want to move through the world this year, what version of yourself you’re committing to, and what you’re no longer willing to tolerate. This is about conscious self-definition.</p>



<p>The final third of the month shifts your focus outward. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, activating your money, values, and resource sector. Conversations around income, pricing, and long-term security come into focus, but in a more innovative, future-oriented way.</p>



<p>Then, Neptune enters Aries on January 26th, beginning a long-term chapter centered on home, emotional healing, and inner belonging. Over the next decade, you’re learning that true stability isn’t just built externally… it’s cultivated from within. January ends with you standing taller, clearer, and more aligned with the life you’re intentionally creating.</p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, January begins with the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your work, wellness, and daily life sector. This is a culmination tied to the last six months around how you manage your energy, time, and responsibilities. You may feel emotionally aware of what’s been sustainable, and what absolutely hasn’t. Starting the year this way brings clarity around burnout, boundaries, and the need to care for your body as much as your vision. This Full Moon asks you to stop sacrificing yourself for productivity and to build routines that actually support your long-term health.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars spends most of January in Capricorn</a>, moving through your sector of rest, healing, and subconscious processing. This is quieter but powerful energy. You may feel called to slow down, work behind the scenes, or release habits and patterns that have been draining you for years. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is a potent moment for intention-setting around rest, spiritual practices, and emotional closure. You’re clearing space — consciously or not — for something new to enter. Trust that what’s dissolving now is making room for your next era.</p>



<p>And then, everything shifts. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering your sign on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, launching you into visibility, momentum, and renewed confidence. You’re sharper, bolder, and more expressive: ready to initiate ideas, lead conversations, and be seen as yourself without editing. This is amplified even more when Neptune enters Aries on January 26th, activating your communication and thought sector for the next decade. Your voice becomes visionary. Your ideas carry inspiration. January ends with you stepping fully into your power, reminding you that when you honor rest first, your brilliance lands even louder.</p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, January opens with the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, illuminating your creativity, romance, pleasure, and self-expression sector. This is a culmination tied to the last six months around joy: what lights you up, who makes you feel alive, and where you may have dimmed yourself out of obligation or exhaustion. Emotions run deep, but in a beautiful way. You may feel more expressive, more romantic, or more connected to your inner child at the start of the year. This Full Moon reminds you that joy is not frivolous… it’s medicine, and it’s essential to your healing.</p>



<p>At the same time, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars moves through Capricorn</a> for most of the month, activating your friendships, community, and long-term goals sector. This brings a grounded, purposeful energy to collaboration. You may feel motivated to commit to a group project, take a leadership role within your community, or get serious about a dream that requires teamwork. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is a powerful moment to set intentions around the future you want to build, and who you want beside you as you do. This is about choosing aligned allies and releasing connections that no longer feel reciprocal.</p>



<p>The final third of the month brings a subtle but meaningful shift. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, encouraging rest, reflection, and behind-the-scenes work. You may feel called to step back slightly, recharge, or prepare quietly for something new. Then, Neptune, your ruling planet, enters Aries on January 26th, beginning a long-term chapter focused on self-worth, resources, and embodiment. Over the next decade, you’re learning to ground your dreams in reality, to value yourself more boldly, and to build stability without sacrificing your magic. January ends with a gentle but powerful message: your sensitivity is your strength, and this year, it’s meant to support you, not drain you.</p>

<p>Happy New Year! It’s fair to say we are all ready to move on from 2025, which is why it’s fantastic that the horoscope for the last night of the year <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">is giving positivity</a>. </p>



<p>The moon sets the vibe, as it moves from indulgent Taurus to witty Gemini on December 31st. On New Year’s Eve, the moon will be in Gemini, allowing us to communicate freely and be our most authentic selves. </p>



<p>December 31st is a time of mixed energies, due to the Gemini Moon, in which we may start the night with one idea in motion and end up at another party. Prepare yourself for the unexpected and go with the flow. Mercury shifts from Sagittarius to Capricorn on New Year’s Day, immediately aspecting the Nodes of Destiny. This cosmic change motivates us to get on track ASAP. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/budgeting-tools-spending-diary"">Our goals for 2026</a> start faster than we can even process them, so let’s go!</p>

<h2>Aries</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Aries</a>, rather than doing the same thing you’ve always done, you’ll find you’re in the mood for different activities. Check if anyone in your circle is hosting a party and attend the gathering. It’ll be nice not to have to host and deal with the cleanup. Now, your primary focus is on socializing and having fun. </p>

<h2>Taurus </h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Taurus</a>, the only thing holding you back from balling around town with friends is your lack of funds to support this endeavor. Even if it means having to live on a budget and cutting back for the next few weeks, you won’t want to miss out on the good vibes and times that New Year’s Day brings.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>

<h2>Gemini </h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Gemini</a>, you’re feeling more like the social butterfly that you are, which means that you’ll be party hopping all night long. The caveat to this plan is that you might meet a stranger who will bring butterflies to your stomach, making you want to stay longer at one event than the others to connect with them.</p>

<h2>Cancer</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Cancer</a>, you’re longing for a low-key New Year’s Eve, which means spending time at home with a few close friends. Invite them over for a chilled out dinner and game night. You’ll have fun celebrating the new year, playing games that bring everyone together, and laughing all night long. The bond you create will bring you closer.</p>

<h2>Leo</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Leo</a>, New Year’s Eve will definitely be one of those nights where you end up singing karaoke at a dive bar. You’ll be surrounded by your squad, who will encourage you to cut loose and sing your own rendition and remix of Taylor Swift’s songs. The results are iconic and worthy of a social media post.</p>

<h2>Virgo</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Virgo</a>, You might get caught up in some serious professional drama if you don’t log out of your email account. Even though it’s a holiday, there is a chance that an issue needs to be addressed before the year wraps up. Put the matter on ice before it consumes your evening. Don’t be in the work zone.</p>

<h2>Libra</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Libra</a>, heading out of town for a unique New Year’s Eve experience is the best choice you’ll ever make.

<h2>Scorpio</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio</a>, you may not be able to stay up until the ball drops, but you’ll try. Therefore, you must put on your pajamas when watching the final episode of <em>Stranger Things</em>. Your significant other/crush won’t mind holding you close and tight during the scary moments of the show and having you fall asleep in their arms. </p>

<h2>Sagittarius</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Sag</a>, put your spirited ways aside this New Year’s Eve and focus on romance. Go out for an intimate dinner for two and come back to a warm, loving home. You’ll be glad that you took the time to be alone with your significant other on the momentous evening. Take photos to crystallize the night together. </p>

<h2>Capricorn</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Capricorn</a>, you might overdo it with the champagne on your leaving, resulting in an intense hangover the next day. If you’re abstaining from alcohol, then you might just be exhausted and in need of relaxation on New Year’s Day. All in all, try to keep the vibe cool and not take it to the extreme.</p>

<p>Cosmic beings, we’ve made it to the final week of 2025, and the threshold of 2026. And honestly? This doesn’t feel like a light, glittery end-of-year moment. This week carries weight. We’re closing out a year of nine, a numerological cycle of completion, karmic closure, and spiritual awakening — often delivered through loss, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/05/11382835/time-management-makeover-productivity-trap"">surrender, and rebirth</a>. On top of that, we’re nearing the end of the Year of the Snake, a long initiation marked by shedding skin slowly, deliberately, sometimes painfully. Even if the letting go happened in baby steps, it still counts. This is the end of a very long cycle, and the body knows it.</p>



<p>Astrologically, the seriousness is unmistakable. Capricorn Season dominates the sky, with a growing stellium that includes Mars, the sun, Venus, and soon Juno entering Capricorn on December 29th, followed by Mercury entering Capricorn on January 1st. This isn’t party energy — it’s legacy energy. Yes, festivities may still happen, especially early in the week, but the collective mood is more reflective than performative. What people really want right now is clarity around purpose, direction, and what they’re building next. And that clarity may not arrive instantly. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Capricorn teaches us</a> that some truths only come through patience, discipline, and showing up even when the answers aren’t fully formed yet.</p>



<p>This is also <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-new-moon-in-sagittarius-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">a Full Moon week</a>, with the emotional intensity building as early as December 29th, leading to the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd. A Capricorn stellium paired with a Cancer Full Moon is a powerful polarity: ambition versus emotion, structure versus sensitivity, duty versus care. This combination brings up deep questions about what we’re working toward, and <em>why</em>. It asks us to feel what we’ve been pushing through, to acknowledge the emotional cost of growth, and to decide what’s actually worth carrying forward. Adding to this intensity, Chiron, the asteroid of our core wounds and healing, stations direct on January 2nd at 9:38 a.m. EST, amplifying the emotional release of this lunation. We’re not just feeling things… we’re transmuting them.</p>



<p>When 2026 officially begins, there’s no room left for self-pity. With Mercury in Capricorn and Chiron moving forward in Aries, the message is clear: we rise again. We’re the warrior who gets back up after being knocked down — not because it’s easy, but because we’ve learned how. The Cancer Full Moon allows us to feel everything, fully and honestly, so we can move forward unburdened. And the fact that the week <em>after</em> this Full Moon is astrologically quiet is no accident. It’s an integration period, a sacred pause to embody the new version of ourselves stepping into a Year of One, the year of initiation and fresh beginnings. We end 2025 with emotional clarity, not illusions. And that, cosmic beings, is a blessing.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, the year doesn’t end quietly for you… it ends with a résumé review and an existential pop quiz. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury enters Capricorn on January 1st, the final days of 2025 and the first moments of 2026 are dominated by serious Capricorn energy in your career and legacy sector. This isn’t just about what you do for work, it’s about what you want to be <em>known</em> for. Reputation, impact, authority, and long-term influence are on your mind. You might catch yourself thinking less “what’s my next move?” and more “what am I building that actually matters?” It’s giving CEO energy, but also philosopher. The upside: you feel powerful, focused, and clear-eyed about your potential. The shadow? Taking yourself a little <em>too</em> seriously — overworking, micromanaging, or forgetting that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bed-rotting-trend-tiktok"">you’re allowed to rest</a>. The move here is to embody leadership without turning life into a performance review.</p>



<p>Then comes the emotional release. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in your sign, and just one day later, the Cancer Full Moon lands in your home and foundation sector. This is big. After months of revisiting old wounds around identity, confidence, and self-trust, Chiron moving forward feels like a quiet but undeniable shift: <em>I’ve survived this, and I’m stronger for it.</em> The Cancer Full Moon invites you to feel everything you’ve been holding together with duct tape: family stuff, inner child stuff, the pressure of always having to be “the strong one.” Let it move through you. Cry if you need to. Clean your space. Have a real conversation. This isn’t weakness… it’s integration. You’re ending the year with emotional clarity and starting the next one grounded in who you actually are, not who you thought you had to be.</p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, the year wraps up with big “zoom out” energy for you. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury enters Capricorn on January 1st, Capricorn energy dominates your beliefs, purpose, and long-term vision sector. You’re less interested in the day-to-day grind and more focused on the <em>why</em> behind it all. This can look like questioning old goals, rethinking a path you once assumed you’d take, or realizing you’ve outgrown a belief system that no longer reflects who you are. It’s giving “I need my life to make sense, actually.” The upside is clarity and maturity… your worldview is evolving. The shadow? Becoming a little rigid or self-righteous about what’s “right.” Stay open. Expansion doesn’t have to come with a superiority complex.</p>



<p>Then the emotional download hits. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your subconscious and communication sectors. You may feel old fears, insecurities, or unspoken truths rise to the surface, especially ones you’ve buried because they felt inconvenient or messy. This is a release moment. Conversations can be healing, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/01/11636388/daily-journaling-mental-health-benefits"">journaling can be cathartic</a>, and rest is non-negotiable. Let yourself name what you’ve been avoiding. This full moon helps you clear mental clutter so you can step into 2026 lighter, calmer, and more emotionally honest. You’re not losing stability… you’re redefining it from the inside out.</p>

<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, the year ends with you doing emotional math you can’t spreadsheet your way out of. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury (your ruler) enters Capricorn on January 1st, the final days of 2025 and the opening of 2026 activate your intimacy, shared resources, and power sector. This is about money you share, energy you exchange, and the unspoken contracts in your closest relationships. You may find yourself asking some very Capricorn-coded questions like: <em>Is this sustainable? Am I giving more than I’m getting? Who actually has access to me like this?</em> The upside is maturity and discernment. The shadow is overthinking or emotionally detaching instead of feeling what’s there. Just because you can intellectualize something doesn’t mean you should avoid processing it.</p>



<p>Then things get real in the best way. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, and on January 3rd, the Cancer Full Moon lights up your money and self-worth sector. Translation: the healing work around belonging, friendship, and feeling “chosen” starts moving forward, and it shows up in how you value yourself. This Full Moon asks you to stop underpricing your time, your labor, and your emotional availability. You may realize you’ve been saying yes out of habit or guilt instead of alignment. Let it go. This is a clearing moment that helps you step into 2026 knowing your worth without needing external validation to confirm it. Less explaining. More embodying.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, the year ends with the spotlight firmly on your relationships and commitments. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury enters Capricorn on January 1st, Capricorn energy continues to activate your partnership sector, making the final days of 2025 and the first moments of 2026 feel serious, clarifying, and no-nonsense. This isn’t about romance alone… it’s about who you’re building life with, who shows up consistently, and who’s actually aligned with your long-term vision. You may find yourself thinking less “do I like this?” and more “can this last?” The upside is emotional maturity and clarity. The shadow is being overly guarded or testing people instead of trusting what you already know. Not every connection needs to prove itself under interrogation.</p>



<p>Then comes the emotional crescendo. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, and on January 3rd, the Full Moon lands in your sign, opening 2026 with undeniable intensity. This is <em>your</em> annual Full Moon — an emotional release, a rebirth, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eat-pray-love-era-generational-appeal"">a reset all in one</a>. After months of pressure around visibility, responsibility, and proving yourself, you’re finally allowed to feel everything you’ve been holding together so gracefully. This Full Moon helps you shed old identities, outdated expectations, and emotional armor you no longer need. You’re not the same person you were at the start of the year… and that’s the point. You enter 2026 softer, clearer, and deeply grounded in what you need to thrive.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, the year wraps up with a very unglamorous but extremely necessary reality check, and honestly, it’s doing you favors. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury enters Capricorn on January 1st, Capricorn energy continues to activate your work, health, and daily life sector. Translation: routines, responsibilities, and the systems holding your life together are under review. You might find yourself reflecting on how you actually spend your time versus how you <em>say</em> you do. Legacy questions come up, but in a grounded way: <em>What kind of life am I sustaining day after day? Is this pace even healthy?</em> The upside is clarity and discipline. The shadow is being overly critical of yourself or turning productivity into self-worth. You’re allowed to be human, not just efficient.</p>



<p>Then comes the emotional release valve. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your rest, healing, and subconscious sector. This is a deep exhale moment. Old fears, grief, or exhaustion you’ve been pushing through finally surface so they can be released. You might feel more tired than usual, more introspective, or in need of solitude — and that’s not a flaw, it’s integration. Let yourself slow down. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/01/11636388/daily-journaling-mental-health-benefits"">Cancel plans. Sleep. Journal</a>. This Full Moon is clearing emotional residue from 2025 so you don’t carry it into 2026. You’re not disappearing… you’re restoring. And that’s how the next chapter actually gets to shine.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, the year closes with you taking joy seriously, and not in a cheesy way. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury (your ruler) enters Capricorn on January 1st, Capricorn energy continues to activate your creativity, romance, and self-expression sector. This isn’t about chasing fun for fun’s sake; it’s about asking what actually nourishes you. You may find yourself reflecting on which passions are worth committing to, which relationships feel aligned with your future self, and where you’ve been treating pleasure like a reward instead of a necessity. The upside is clarity and devotion to what truly matters. The shadow? Over-curating your happiness or putting pressure on yourself to “optimize” joy. Let it be real, not perfect.</p>



<p>Then the emotional shift lands. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your community, friendships, and long-term goals sector. This is a release moment around belonging — who you feel safe dreaming with and where you’ve outgrown certain circles. You may realize that some connections were season-long, not lifetime ones, and that’s okay. The Full Moon helps you let go of people-pleasing and step into more emotionally honest alignment. You enter 2026 clearer about who’s on your team and what future you’re actually working toward. Less obligation, more intention.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, the year closes with you getting extremely honest about what “home” actually means. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury enters Capricorn on January 1st, Capricorn energy continues to activate your home, family, and emotional foundation sector. This isn’t just about your physical space… it’s about what (and who) grounds you when no one’s watching. You may find yourself reflecting on family dynamics, living situations, or emotional patterns you’ve outgrown. It’s giving “I love you, but this setup no longer works for me.” The upside is maturity and self-respect. The shadow is feeling guilty for wanting stability on <em>your</em> terms. Reminder: prioritizing your nervous system is not selfish, it’s necessary.</p>



<p>Then comes the emotional peak. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your career and public life sector. This is a big moment around visibility and self-trust. Old wounds tied to approval, partnership dynamics, or fear of being judged may surface — especially if you’ve been shrinking yourself to keep the peace. Let it rise so it can release. This Full Moon helps you reclaim authority over your path and redefine success in a way that feels emotionally sustainable. You’re stepping into 2026 clearer about where you’re going, and more importantly, who you no longer need permission from to get there.</p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, the year ends with your mind in full executive mode. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury follows on January 1st, Capricorn energy continues to activate your communication, thinking, and decision-making sector. You’re not in the mood for vague plans, emotional spirals, or conversations that go nowhere. This is about clarity, boundaries, and saying exactly what you mean, with fewer disclaimers. You may find yourself reflecting on how you’ve been using your voice all year: what you’ve said, what you’ve withheld, and where silence was strategic versus self-sabotaging. The upside is sharp focus and authority. The shadow? Becoming overly blunt or emotionally armored. Precision doesn’t require coldness, just intention.</p>



<p>Then comes the perspective shift. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your beliefs, purpose, and long-term vision sector. This is a moment of emotional truth around what you actually believe in, and whether your life reflects it. Old wounds tied to burnout, over-responsibility, or “doing everything yourself” come up so they can finally move forward. The Full Moon may bring a realization that changes how you see your future, your faith, or your next chapter entirely. Let it land. You’re ending 2025 with mental clarity and entering 2026 with emotional alignment. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/being-boring-is-good"">No drama… Just evolution.</a></p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, the year closes with your attention firmly on money, value, and sustainability. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury enters Capricorn on January 1st, Capricorn energy continues to activate your income and self-worth sector. This isn’t about restriction, it’s about reality. You’re taking a long, honest look at what you earn, what you spend, and what your time is actually worth. Legacy questions come up here too, but in a very tangible way: <em>How do I support the life I say I want?</em> The upside is clarity and empowerment. The shadow is spiraling into “ugh, capitalism” energy instead of making practical moves. You don’t have to sell your soul… you just have to stop winging it.</p>



<p>Then the emotional release lands. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your creativity, joy, and intimacy sectors. This is a powerful moment around healing wounds tied to pleasure, romance, and feeling chosen, while also releasing emotional or financial entanglements that have felt heavy or unclear. You may realize you’ve been over-giving, over-merging, or carrying responsibility that isn’t actually yours. Let it go. This Full Moon helps you reset boundaries around energy and trust so you can enter 2026 lighter, freer, and more emotionally honest. Stability doesn’t <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/being-boring-is-good"">have to feel boring</a>, and this week proves it.</p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, this is your week… and you feel it. As Juno enters your sign on December 29th and Mercury enters Capricorn on January 1st, the end of 2025 and the beginning of 2026 revolve squarely around <em>you</em>. Identity, commitments, boundaries, and self-definition are front and center. This isn’t about proving anything anymore — it’s about deciding who you’re willing to be accountable to, including yourself. You may feel more serious, more focused, and more intentional about how you show up in the world. The upside is authority and clarity. The shadow? Carrying the weight of the world like it’s your job. Reminder: leadership doesn’t mean self-erasure. You’re allowed to be powerful <em>and</em> human.</p>



<p>Then the emotional truth hits. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your home, family, and partnership axis. This brings deep feelings around belonging, emotional safety, and the roles you’ve played for others, sometimes at your own expense. Old wounds tied to family dynamics, vulnerability, or letting others support you may surface so they can finally move forward. Let yourself feel it without turning it into a to-do list. This Full Moon helps you soften the armor just enough to start 2026 emotionally aligned, not just externally successful. You’re not losing control… you’re gaining balance.</p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, the year ends with you in low-battery-but-high-awareness mode. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury enters Capricorn on January 1st, the Capricorn pile-up activates your rest, retreat, and subconscious sector. Translation: you’re done explaining yourself, done overextending, and done pretending you’re not tired. This is a deeply reflective moment where legacy questions surface privately, not publicly. Instead of asking <em>what am I building?</em> You’re asking <em>what needs to end so I can build anything at all?</em> The upside is profound clarity and emotional maturity. The shadow is isolation or ghosting instead of communicating needs. You don’t have to disappear to protect your energy. Quiet boundaries work too.</p>



<p>Then the reset arrives. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your work, wellness, and daily life sector. This is a release around burnout, obligation, and the pressure to always be useful. You may finally admit that a routine, job, or responsibility has been costing you more than it’s giving. Let that truth land. This Full Moon helps you clear emotional residue from 2025 so you can enter 2026 with healthier systems, and less resentment. You’re not here to martyr yourself for the future. You’re here to build it sustainably.</p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, the year closes with you getting very selective about your future and the people in it. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury follows suit on January 1st, Capricorn energy activates your community, friendships, and long-term vision sector. You’re not interested in vague dreams or feel-good group chats anymore. This is about asking real questions: <em>Who am I building with? Who actually shows up? What future do I want to commit to?</em> You may feel less tolerant of flaky dynamics and more drawn to people who match your effort and integrity. The upside is discernment and maturity. The shadow is cynicism and assuming no one can meet you where you are. Stay open, but stay real.</p>



<p>Then the emotional release arrives. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your creativity, joy, romance, and inner child sector. This is a powerful moment of healing around worthiness, especially the belief that joy has to be earned or justified. Old wounds tied to money, self-esteem, or being chosen soften and begin to move forward. Let yourself feel happiness without overanalyzing it. Create something. Laugh. Rest. This Full Moon reminds you that pleasure is not a distraction from your purpose — it’s part of it. You enter 2026 lighter, clearer, and more emotionally aligned with what actually makes life feel worth living.</p>

<p>2026 is poised to be a highly productive year. Numerologically, 2026 is a number one year, promising <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/08/11504131/practical-classic-outfits-styling-ideas"">a fresh start</a>, which is exactly the kind of energy we all need.

<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Here are the key astrological takeaways  </h3>



<p>Two out of the four eclipses occurring this year are a result of the Nodes of Destiny’s entrance into the Aquarius and Leo lunar axis on July 26th. This is a time of unique thought, charity, and compassion. The eclipses are:  </p>



<p><strong>February 17th:</strong> the annular solar eclipse in Aquarius </p>



<p><strong>March 3rd:</strong> a total lunar eclipse in Virgo  </p>



<p><strong>August 12th:</strong> a total solar eclipse in Leo </p>



<p><strong>August 28th:</strong> a partial lunar eclipse in Pisces </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<p>Mercury retrograde occurs three times this year. Since Mercury is moonwalking in the water signs, we will <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/healed-too-much-self-work-romantic-relationships"">get reflective and heal</a>.  Take note of: </p>



<p><strong>February 26th to March 20th:</strong> Mercury retrogrades in Pisces  </p>



<p><strong>June 29th to July 23rd:</strong> Mercury retrogrades in Cancer  </p>



<p><strong>October 24th to November 13th:</strong> Mercury retrogrades in Scorpio  </p>



<p>Venus retrograde spin in Scorpio and Libra happens between October 3rd and November 13th. Relationships might stall and be full of theatrics and intensity. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<p>These are the main planetary ingresses of 2026:  </p>



<p><strong>January 26th:</strong> Neptune re-enters Aries, taking us back to the spring of 2025, pushing us to unconditionally love ourselves  </p>



<p><strong>February 13th:</strong> Saturn moves into Aries again, bring back the authoritative vibe from last spring  </p>



<p><strong>April 25th:</strong> Uranus flies into Gemini again, having transitioned into Gemini in the past summer, consuming the internet with questionable information  </p>



<p><strong>June 30th:</strong> Jupiter enters Leo, boosting our rizz  </p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, your willingness to learn, regardless of your age, is such an empowering and refreshing quality. Your dedication proves to be an undeniable asset that is quite admirable. The year ahead provides you with time to work on and consider your own emotional and mental wellness for the future. You’re trying to make wise decisions right now, with Saturn and Neptune connecting with your sun (they form an exact conjunction on February 20th). Uranus in Gemini gives you the confidence to take action, even if you are unsure of the full effect it will have. The impact that Uranus will have on your chart is exhilarating. Because of your passionate nature, you’ve picked up multiple skills, making Jupiter’s time in Leo a critical time to take part in hobbies that speak to you. Mark your iCal for June 30th to celebrate your gifts, even if the eclipses on Friday, August 17th, aren’t making you feel like the vibrant ram you are. </p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, there has been a lot of changes in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/getting-comfortable-in-relationship"">your intimate relationships</a>, resulting in a feeling of unpredictability, which you’re not a fan of. As the planets move forward, you’ll feel a sense of calm and relief on April 25th, when Uranus releases you from the seven-year topsy-turvy transit on your sun. As a result, being more structured in your life will result in a chain of beneficial events, like an expansion of your home on June 30th, when Jupiter enters Leo. The only thing that weighs on your shoulders is that Venus’s backward spring, which commences on October 3rd and lasts until November 13th in Scorpio and Libra, plus Mercury retrograde from October 24th to November 13th in Scorpio, might bring the drama back into your orb by reigniting a former flame. Do not make the same mistakes and recreate similar patterns you’ve evolved from — no more recycling exes. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, Uranus’s seven-year switch is serving as rebranding for your aura, when it begins its epic transit on your sun. You had a little taste of its change last year, when Uranus first entered Gemini in the summer. Now, as the wild planet moves forward, you’re having a spring awakening that begins on April 25th. The revolutionary planet is allowing you to take a new stance on older views. You’ll feel that everything that you once believed in is now evolving, which is a wonderful thing. The retrogrades of 2026, particularly February 26th’s Mercury rewind in Pisces, will prompt you to revitalize your goals to get a step ahead. In the process of achieving success, you will need to reassess your plan and make adjustments to refine your vision. At times, life can become chaotic, but it is a natural part of the journey. This is your moment to ignite your truth and become the real version of yourself. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>

<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, this is your year to shine. Jupiter is riding high on your sign until June 30th, bringing success in your endeavors. Your social life will be thriving as a result. However, Saturn and Neptune’s conjunction on February 20th is going to make you question your goals. Don’t stress because you’ll be able to figure out your path by reflecting over the summer when Mercury backstrokes on your sun from June 29th to July 23rd. A new version of a former dream is going to stimulate your mind. It could be professional, romantic, or travel coded. You should go for it and not look back. Embrace the notion and rise to the occasion, wherever it takes you. July 26th’s nodal ingress into Aquarius and Leo is going to help you boss up to be the strongest and most efficient version of yourself. Overall, 2026 is the year of the crab. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, intimacy stems from the willingness to express vulnerabilities. As someone who has a prideful demeanor, this can be challenging. Fortunately, 2026 urges you to lean into relationships. The eclipses on February 17th and August 12th, combined with Jupiter’s entrance into your sun sign on June 30th and Pluto’s continuing transit through your seventh house of personal connections, glow up your vibe and desire to commit. Even if you’re in a partnership, you’ll want to work through the insecurities and vulnerabilities you encounter. Being open and honest with your partner and friends when Uranus swings into Gemini on August 25th can help create a better dynamic and ease your daily stresses. The ability to trust your significant other during Venus and Mercury retrograde in the fall, when you’re not around, will prove crucial and beneficial for the future. You won’t have to worry about them doing the right thing — you’ll know that they are. </p>

<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, the eclipses of 2025 straddled between your first and seventh house. The juxtaposition in these sectors prompted you to take a closer look at the people you’re drawing near to you. They are mirroring your actions and reflecting the energy you’re projecting. As 2026 begins, you are going through similar eclipses and experiences on March 3rd and August 28th. The silver lining is that you are wiser to the game and are going to be vigilant about who has access to your energy to ensure you’re not losing in love. You will never let yourself be put in similar situations. However, you might be tested during Mercury’s moonwalk in Pisces from February 25th to March 20th. The key is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/casual-relationship-rules-boundaries"">to create boundaries</a> to ensure that they don’t find their way back into your heart. The good news is that your team is going to support you throughout the year and offer you valuable advice.  </p>

<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, the Saturn and Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th centers around partnerships and contracts for you. Before signing any documents, ensure that you have a third-party review the contracts. You don’t want to give anyone authority over you, especially when it comes to financial decisions. The flip side is that it could be a time when you DTR. The Nodes of Destiny move into the Aquarius and Leo axis on August 26th, starting a new year and a half cycle, encouraging you to be free from the artistic constraints that have been holding you back. The caveat is that Pluto’s presence in your fifth house of creativity is going to make you more competitive in your field. Venus’s retrograde in Scorpio and Libra from October 3rd to November 13th escalates the desire to be number one; it doesn’t matter how the world views you, but what matters is how you feel about yourself. </p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, just when you thought things were beginning to quiet down a plot twist occurs. The eclipses on February 17th and August 12th, along with Pluto’s transit in the ancestral and foundational sector of your chart, urge you to maintain a healthy balance between your career and home life. With the Nodes of Destiny moving into Aquarius and Leo on July 26th for the next 18 months, you’re going to have to make professional sacrifices to assist your family. The frustration begins to weigh on you when Venus and Mercury retrograde, starting on October 3rd and October 24th. Both planets clear their moonwalk on November 13th, giving you a sigh of relief and the ability to transcend, as you shed your energy and integrate newness into your thinking and living. Shutting down the past will be easier to do at this time because you’ll have a clear direction about where you’re meant to be in the year. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, the Saturn and Neptune alliance on February 20th in Aries, is going to have a sobering effect on you. It’s not that you’re not going to want to go out and have fun, but you’re going to change your approach to what constitutes a good time. Instead of drinking or engaging in frivolous conversations, you will focus your energy on activities that are meaningful and enriching to your life. Your planetary ruler, Jupiter, switches signs from Cancer to Leo on June 30th, urging you to transform your innermost philosophies. While this is something you usually do, you’ll find that the focus is more on spiritual endeavors, since the South Node of Destiny triggers Jupiter. You may even feel called to take a class on a topic that you previously excelled in to gain a different understanding and appreciation of the subject. Broaden your mind in 2026 to enhance your knowledge and world. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, 2026 is a year for you to take a step back from the daily grind. With Saturn and Neptune joining forces in your fourth house of home and family on February 20th, you’ll have a patient attitude that allows you to focus on the here and now. Of course, you might get caught up in your emotions and drift away into fantasies every so often, but for most of the year, you’re going to be redefining your value system. Uranus’s re-entrance into Gemini on April 25th will help you to really see progress if you allow yourself to slow down. Appreciating the little things can lead to new ideas. Taking a playful approach to life, for once, will keep you motivated. These ventures will be fortuitous, especially since Jupiter in Cancer is lighting up your relationships and bringing fabulous people into your sphere for the first six months of the year. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, have you put others’ needs before your own? This is a year when you reclaim your authority and vigor. The North Node of Destiny links up with your sun sign on July 26th, heightening your sense of self and admiration from others. The eclipses on February 17th and August 12th offer you a chance to diversify your success by helping others. However, they may not accept it, since Jupiter in Leo is making them prideful. Pay close attention to who exits your life because they may be a secret hater. Pluto’s allegiance with your sun sign reveals your shadow side and allows you to choose a different story for yourself. If you’ve been accepting the lower form of the package, you have no choice but to confront your passions right now. There is no more settling for the lesser of the deal during this time. This is a life-changing metamorphosis at an exponential rate. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, Neptune’s reemergence in Aries on January 26th gives a false sense of confidence, making you appear braver than you are or need to be. You’ll need to temper your ego to avoid coming across as arrogant and strive to remain grounded. The eclipses on March 3rd and August 28th are pushing you into the spotlight and giving you a chance to reflect on how your actions are affecting others. It’s terrific to be popular and liked. Still, you shouldn’t take the people who have been with you from the beginning for granted. Mercury’s backward spin on your sign, which commences between February 26th and March 20th, is going to let you see just that; however, with Uranus in Gemini rolling into your fourth house on April 25th, you may get sidetracked by home renovations and familial issues. Likely, you might not see the big picture until Jupiter enters Leo on June 30th. </p>

<p>2025 was a standout year for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/spring-skincare-trends-2025"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">skincare trends</a>. In the spring, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/autumn-winter-skincare-trends-2024"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">polynucleotides — DNA derived from salmon</a> or trout — took off, with experts using them in facial treatments to repair skin and boost hydration. By summer, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/led-face-mask-red-light-skin-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">LED face masks</a> were everywhere, praised for their ability to reduce acne and stimulate collagen. Fall then marked the megawatt return of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pat-mcgrath-glass-skin-fetish-mask-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">glass skin</a>. But with another year on the horizon, you can bet that it’ll be packed with even more skincare innovations to try. </p>



<p>Whether your main goal is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-sulfur-10-powder-to-cream-concentrate-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">clearing up your skin</a> or investing in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-beauty-led-face-mask-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">skincare tech</a>, here are the five trends experts say will reign supreme in 2026 — and there’s something for everyone, no matter your skin type or budget. </p>



<h2>The next wave of Korean skincare </h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/miamiapark/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mia Park</a>, founder of New York–based K-beauty brand <a href=""https://stay-lazy.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lazy Skincare</a>, says we’ve only seen the beginning of what <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/is-korean-skincare-better-expert-advice"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Korean skincare</a> can achieve. “The next wave of innovation is already emerging as Korean labs push boundaries in texture science, botanicals, and multifunctional formulas,” says Park. Lazy’s <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstay-lazy.com%2Fproducts%2Fdouble-duty"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Double Duty</a> — a serum-moisturizer duo — is an example of how brands are combining effective plant-based ingredients (think red camellia and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bakuchiol-natural-retinol-alternative"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">bakuchiol to target uneven skin tone</a>, and silver ear mushroom to boost moisture) with skin-strengthening, fast-healing peptides and oil-controlling niacinamide.  </p>



<p>K-beauty treatments are set to make their way into skincare clinics, too. Local Dynamic Micro-Massage, or LDM, utilizes dual-frequency ultrasound to stimulate collagen and elastin — key proteins that provide skin with structure and strength. A 20-minute session can also reduce inflammation and support the skin barrier, the outermost layer that locks in moisture and keeps out bacteria. LDM should always be performed by a qualified dermatologist or esthetician. </p>



<h2>Slow-release skincare </h2>



<p>If you’ve fallen into the “more is more” trap — overloading your skin with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">high concentrations of retinoids</a>, exfoliating acids, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vitamin-c-alternatives-sensitive-skin"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">antioxidants like vitamin C</a> — advanced facialist <a href=""https://mariamabbas.co.uk/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mariam Abbas</a> says that the slow-release skincare trend is for you. She points out that many brands are now “encapsulating” their formulas, wrapping potent ingredients in tiny moisturizing capsules for controlled release. They reach the skin a little more slowly but still deliver results — without irritation. </p>



<p>Take <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinkeylist.com%2Fproducts%2Fstarter-retinol"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Inkey List’s new Starter Retinol Serum</a>, which features encapsulated retinol. The encapsulated ingredient acts like a cushion, targeting uneven skin tone, texture, and fine lines while minimizing the risk of sore, sensitive, dry, or flaky skin. If you’re a seasoned retinoid user, try the brand’s <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinkeylist.com%2Fproducts%2Fadvanced-retinal"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Advanced 0.2% Retinal Serum</a>. Not to be confused with retinol, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">retin<em>al</em> works faster</a> because it requires fewer steps to convert into retinoic acid on the skin — the active ingredient that actually gets to work. The retinal in this product is also encapsulated, which helps make dry, sensitive skin much less of a concern. </p>



<p>If you prefer exfoliating acids, opt for a leave-on formula that works gradually, rather than a high-strength flash mask that can leave skin feeling parched. Try <a href=""https://www.timeline.com/skincare/products/resurfacing-exfoliator"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Timeline Skincare’s Mito-Biotic Resurfacing Exfoliator</a>, which uses a balanced trifecta of acids — including gentle salicylic, lactic, and mandelic acids — to help prevent breakouts while improving skin texture and tone.</p>





<h2>Skin wellbeing </h2>



<p>“A cultural shift is underway, and living well is replacing the need to appear busy,” says Park, adding, “This mindset is reshaping beauty,” specifically, skincare. Bloomberg recently proclaimed that “<a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-09/wellness-is-the-new-nightlife-as-young-people-drink-less"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">wellness is the new nightlife</a>,” Park points out, and she says that in 2026, the skincare products that will succeed are those that support “calm, recovery, and low-stress routines.”  </p>



<p>Lazy’s <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstay-lazy.com%2Fproducts%2Fdouble-duty"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Double Duty Serum Moisturizer Duo</a> features squalane, glycerin, hyaluronic acid, and peptides to hydrate, moisturize, and support the skin’s natural healing response. Skincare packed with vitamins is another option — like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fdermalogica-biolumin-c-night-restore-serum-with-pro-vitamin-d-complex-P512961%3F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dermalogica Biolumin-C Night Restore Serum with Pro-Vitamin D Complex</a>, which brightens and strengthens the skin barrier overnight. <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP455365"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Inkey List’s Vitamin B, C, and E Moisturizer</a> helps control excess oil, shields against environmental aggressors such as pollution, and provides deep hydration in one go. </p>



<p>We’ll also see more products spotlighting matcha and green tea as hero ingredients, helping to protect skin from urban stressors thanks to their antioxidant properties. Try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.timeline.com%2Fskincare%2Fproducts%2Ffirming-serum"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Timeline Skincare Mito-Biotic Firming Serum</a>, infused with green tea, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fmatcha-calming-cream-pimprod2055952%3Fsku%3D2651317"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">TirTir Matcha Calming Cream</a> to help quell redness. Park makes a great point: “You can’t out-serum an exhausted nervous system, but beauty products that make space for rest is the future.” </p>





<h2>Underspending on the basics </h2>



<p>Dermatologist <a href=""https://www.dropheliaveraitch.co.uk/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Ophelia Veraitch</a> has noticed that many patients assume the more expensive a product, the better the results. “That’s rarely true,” she says. In fact, she recommends sticking to the basics for cleansers and moisturizers. There are plenty of excellent, affordable options for all skin types, including <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP505274"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary Glucoside Foaming Cleanser</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fhydrating-facial-cleanser-xlsImpprod4190255%3Fsku%3D2241933"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser</a>, and <a href=""https://www.target.com/p/byoma-blemish-acne-clearing-creamy-cleanser-5-91-fl-oz/-/A-94468810"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Byoma Blemish Clearing Creamy Cleanser</a>.  </p>



<p>When it comes to moisturizers, simple is often best, especially if you’re layering serums with active ingredients like retinol, vitamin C, or exfoliating acids. Our favorites include <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fhydro-boost-hyaluronic-acid-water-gel-moisturizer-xlsImpprod12041835%3Fsku%3D2284291"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fholy-hydration-daily-moisturizer-xlsImpprod14481069%3Fsku%3D2500311"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">e.l.f. Holy Hydration Moisturizer</a>, and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FCetaphil-Daily-Oil-Free-Hydrating-Lotion-with-Hyaluronic-Acid-3-fl-oz%2F55092626"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cetaphil Daily Hydrating Lotion</a>. </p>



<p>Dr. Veraitch recommends investing in high-quality active ingredients suited to your skin type and concerns, for example, niacinamide for oily or acne-prone skin, or hyaluronic acid for dry, dehydrated skin, along with a reliable, high-factor broad-spectrum sunscreen. “This matters far more than price,” she says. </p>







<h2>Minimalism is the new luxury </h2>



<p>“In 2026, the most desirable routines won’t be the longest,” says Park, “they’ll be the smartest.” With budgets tightening and dermatologists noting that multi-step skincare routines can sometimes be counterproductive, Park predicts we’ll favor fewer products, clearer choices, and formulas that truly multitask. </p>



<p>Think moisturizers packed with active ingredients that can replace toners and serums. R29 recommends <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fmajor-fade-active-seal-dark-spot-vitamin-c-gel-moisturizer-P510561"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Idriss Major Fade Active Seal Moisturizer</a>, which features brightening vitamin C and eliminates the need for a dedicated serum. Also worth trying are <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fsuperactive-mattifying-oil-pore-control-moisturizer-spf-50-pimprod2050402%3Fsku%3D2635510"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Murad Superactive Mattifying Oil + Pore Control Moisturizer SPF 50</a>, a high-factor SPF with oil-reducing niacinamide, and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbyoma-blemish-acne-control-moisturizer-1-69-fl-oz%2F-%2FA-94468812"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Byoma Blemish Acne Control Moisturizer</a>, which uses salicylic acid to prevent new breakouts while providing deep hydration. </p>



<p>Park says that minimalism isn’t about doing less for your skin. “It’s about guiltlessly skipping what doesn’t matter and prioritizing what does.”  </p>

<p>In his recent cold-weather trend report, hair artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tomsmithhd/?hl=en"">Tom Smith</a> predicted that muted mid — essentially “soft, neutral-warm shades that sit between blonde, brunette, and copper” — will reign supreme. “It’s a fusion of all the recent trends, but intentionally subtle and noncommittal,” says Smith. Think Hailey Bieber, Taylor Swift, and Madelaine Petsch — or content creator <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DDsFPXUNEPd/?hl=en"">Zoe Hayes</a> here. Shades like this are low-maintenance, versatile, and chic, adds Smith. “Simply ask for a natural earthy undertone to your shade of choice and maintain it with glossing treatments to keep the finish refined and the color looking shiny and intentional.” We swear by <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fglazehair.com%2Fcollections%2Fsuper-gloss"">Glaze’s Supergloss</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/seanmichaelhair/?hl=en"">Sean Michael</a>, a Boston-based balayage specialist and owner of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thesalonbeau/?hl=en"">Salon Beau</a>, identifies “cherry cola brunette” as the brooding shade to watch this winter. “It’s all thanks to the rich depth and understated hint of cherry tone,” explains Michael, much like this shade on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DMYY3uhofIy/?img_index=1"">Alice x T</a>. “It gives dark hair a moody, polished glow without tipping into a full red, making it a great choice for brunettes who want something new.” Fortunately, cherry cola brunette suits everyone. “Ask your stylist for a deep brunette base enhanced with soft violet-red lowlights or a cherry-toned gloss to create that cola-inspired richness,” advises Michael.</p>

<p>“Honey butter blonde is poised to dominate winter because warm, creamy shades are finally taking the spotlight again,” says Michael. This shade is defined by a “soft candlelit glow” that adds brightness and shine to hair during an otherwise moody season. “To get the look, ask your colorist for a warm-neutral blonde with subtle golden dimension and a glossy finish to enhance that buttery warmth,” Michael says. We love this look on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPoeddQCPeU/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Fatima Ezzahrae Najib</a>.</p>

<p>In his trend report, Smith describes gothic brunette as an “ultra-dark, almost inky brunette with intense depth and shine,” like this color posted to Instagram by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DROY7h_Ebg4/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Ryenne Snow</a>. This shade works best for those with a naturally dark base, he explains, suggesting you ask your colorist for an espresso- or black cherry-toned gloss to take your natural color a shade or two deeper. The darker the hair, the glossier it appears as it catches the light. Look to Margaret Qualley, Kendall Jenner, and Nicola Peltz Beckham for inspiration.</p>

<p>Gonzalez pinpoints golden strawberry blonde as the hair color to watch, thanks to its luminosity and sunshine vibes — something we seriously lack in the drab winter months. “This shade combines the brightness of blonde with copper warmth, creating a glowing look that feels fresh,” explains Gonzalez, adding that it’s great for blondes who want warmth and depth, or brunettes ready to go a little lighter. “Just ask for a warm honey base with golden copper undertones or face-framing pieces,” says Gonzalez. This shade created by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DFFMyfGST6U/"">Sophie Malic</a> is beautiful.</p>

<p>“This hair color technique involves low-commitment demi-permanent glosses that deepen your natural base by one or two levels, while keeping your existing highlights visible,” says <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/treehousehair/?hl=en"">Travis Ogletree</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.moroccanoil.com%2F"">Moroccanoil</a> colorist ambassador. He notes that many of his clients flirt with the idea of going darker but don’t want to lose the effortless, lived-in dimension they’ve built. “An all-over gloss is the perfect middle ground,” says Ogletree. “It adds shine, tone, and depth without feeling heavy.” In the salon, Ogletree reaches for the <a href=""https://moroccanoilprofessionals.com/products/color-calypso-demi-permanent-gloss-cream/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Moroccanoil Color Calypso Demi-Permanent Color</a>. “The Gloss and Cream options are both perfect for this.” Look to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DN-ytYcDZbg/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Rachel Redd</a>’s post on Instagram for inspiration. </p>

<p>“At some point, most of us have said that our hair looked its best when we were kids,” says Ogletree, “so ‘born blonde’ is more of an ideology than a trend because it’s based on what naturally suited you — whether that was bright blonde, sandy tones, or soft pops on the ends.” All you need to do? Bring in a photo of yourself as a child. “Those small details help your stylist recreate a version that feels authentic and flattering,” says Ogletree, who turns to Moroccanoil’s Blonde Voyage portfolio of lighteners, specifically Clay and Cream, to lighten clients’ hair. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPo9gyigrgF/?hl=en"">Marco Gilento</a> nails this shade here.</p>

<p>Schwartz describes light suede blonde as a “luminous,” bright shade that frames the face and adds soft depth through the lengths — think of the way a suede bag subtly glistens in winter sun. “It’s setting the tone for one of the season’s most coveted blondes,” he says.

<p>Michael touts this earthier shade as a “cool-neutral blend” that adds dimension and gives brunette hair an expensive look — much like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DGuKJk4v6TN/"">this creation by @a_knack_yuna</a>. It’s all about the soft, smoky gradient, Michael says. “This flatters a wide range of skin tones and grows out seamlessly, making it perfect for anyone who wants low-maintenance color that still feels modern.” Michael recommends asking your colorist for a neutral brunette base with ashy balayage throughout. “This will create that seamless mocha-toned transition,” he says.</p>

<p>This hair color trend draws from eras past. “It’s a honeyed but muted blonde that feels retro and nostalgic, yet still fresh,” says Smith in his trend report. Perfect for colder months, it adds a subtle warmth. “This works best for natural blondes or brunettes looking to add warmth in a mature, elegant way while keeping depth and medium contrast,” he explains. Smith recommends asking your colorist for a “muted golden balayage” or a warm gloss after highlights to bring richness back into your strands.

<p>Greige occupies a cozy space between grey and beige, says Smith, adding, “It honors natural silver while brightening and warming the complexion.” Greige is a perfect middle ground for those who want to embrace, rather than cover, their natural hair, he notes, while the added richness from blonde highlights keeps it feeling fresh and dimensional.

<p>“Muted blonde sits between bright blonde and light brunette,” says Gonzalez. “Think soft beige, sandy, or mushroom shades of blonde rather than high-lift platinum. It balances warm and cool undertones for a gentle ‘lived-in’ effect.” If you have light-to-medium blonde hair or light brown lengths and want to soften your color a bit, Gonzalez says a simple salon gloss can get you there. This color by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DFehTNpzQbw/?hl=en"">Diane Gorgievski</a> is stunning.</p>

When the leaves have left the trees, the air turns cold and misty, and the temperature stays 50 degrees (or below), there’s only one thing to do. Tuck yourself under a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cozy-season-essentials-editors-picks"">toasty blanket</a> for as long as socially acceptable with a collection of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/12/186063/cheesy-christmas-movies-on-netflix"">comfort movies</a> right by your side.<br /><br />There’s no shortage of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/11/217808/christmas-movie-tropes"">good Christmas films</a>. Classics like <em>Elf </em>or <em>Rudolph: Red Nose Reindeer </em>are perfect comedies and low-stakes dramas to watch with your friends and families. But they’re not the most snug and soul-warming flicks out there. Yes, they’re all about the holiday cheer (which is an element of coziness), but they’re more funny and entertaining than anything. <br /><br />No, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/07/163987/best-feel-good-movies"">perfect cozy film</a> has a story that’ll tug at your heartstrings but will also make you ugly laugh. <br /><br />To ease your quest for the coziest film, we searched far and wide (aka the libraries of most major streaming services) for the best cozy movies the internet has to offer this holiday season. Some are new, some are oldies but goodies; some have absolutely nothing to do with the holidays at all. Regardless, these are the most heartwarming films to watch by yourself (or with friends and family) on the sofa by the crackling fire with a cup of cocoa and a tray of Snickerdoodles.  Merry streaming.  <figure><figcaption><strong><em><h2>The Wrong Paris (2025)</h2></em></strong><em>The Wrong Paris</em> makes for the ultimate comfort movie when you’re over holiday movies but still want that feel-good buzz. On the surface, it’s a breezy Netflix rom-com about Dawn (Miranda Cosgrove), an aspiring artist who joins a Bachelor-style reality show thinking she’s headed to Paris, France — only to land in Paris, Texas instead, thanks to an outrageous producer twist. What follows is a lighthearted mix of reality-show antics, cowboy charm (hello, Trey, played by Pierson Fodé), and the kind of predictable but satisfying romantic beats that make you sigh with relief rather than eye-roll with exhaustion.<br /><br /><strong>Stream it on <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/81700163"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Netflix</a></strong>.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><strong><em>The Best Man Holiday</em> (2013)</strong></h2><br /> <br />A rare sequel that’s better than the original, <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sanaa-lathan-interview"">The Best Man Holiday</a> </em>is a must-watch every holiday season (though, we argue it’s a great film to watch all year round). Similar to its predecessor, it follows a group of college friends gathering again, this time for the holidays.

<p>Cosmic beings, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-planners"">2026 is the money year</a> many of us have been preparing for without even realizing it. In numerology, 2026 adds up to 1, the number of beginnings, boldness, and unfiltered potential. And because it carries the purity of initiation, it asks us to step into the frontier of our lives with intention. Layer that with the fact that 2026 is the Year of the Fire Horse in Chinese astrology, and suddenly the collective energy becomes unmistakable. Fire Horse years do not whisper… they gallop. They set the air ablaze with courage, momentum, and manifestation. So financially this means we aren’t thinking small in 2026. We’re thinking fast, wide, brave, and new.</p>



<p>Astrologically, this rebirth is echoed by Saturn and Neptune both entering Aries, the first sign of the zodiac. Saturn, the planet of responsibility, structure, and mastery, joins Neptune, the planet of dreams, intuition, and surrender. Aries is the flame that says “go,” even when you’re shaking. So we enter a year where dreams demand structure… and structure demands imagination. Fire and faith are learning to coexist. We’re collectively remembering that discipline is sacred, that courage is spiritual, and that starting over is a portal, not a punishment. This is a year of initiation that doesn’t wait for your confidence before giving you the opportunity. It gives you the opportunity so your confidence can rise to meet it.</p>



<p>By contrast, 2025 was the Year of the Snake, a numerology 9 year, and a cycle of closures, purging, and spiritual composting. Many of us spent 2025 confronting the roots of our money stories… the fears we inherited, the habits we unconsciously upheld, the emotional knots tied to worth, earning, and receiving. We learned that money isn’t just currency, it’s spiritual energy… a mirror of our subconscious relationship with safety, sovereignty, and expansion. 2025 loosened the soil. It forced us to acknowledge where we shrink, where we self-abandon, and where we avoid our deepest desires. Those realizations were not meant to break us. They were meant to prepare us.</p>



<p>Now, in 2026, the universe says: apply it. This is a year of experimentation, risk-taking, courage, and embodied learning. The best way to integrate what we healed in 2025 is to <em>become</em> the version of ourselves we kept envisioning. Many of us will feel the pull toward entrepreneurship or creative independence — not out of pressure, but out of alignment. Jupiter’s entrance into Leo (on June 30th) and the ascent of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/pluto-retrograde-in-aquarius-may-2025-meaning-effects"">Pluto in Aquarius</a> until 2044 is accelerating this shift. Pluto transforms whatever it touches, and Aquarius rules innovation, digital futures, alternative paths, and self-liberation. I predicted last year that we’d collectively turn toward entrepreneurship, and now we’re entering the phase where that prediction becomes undeniable.</p>



<p>And the energy intensifies: Saturn and Neptune in Aries form harmonious aspects to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/pluto-retrograde-in-aquarius-may-2025-meaning-effects"">Pluto in Aquarius</a>, helping us translate ideas into systems, visions into strategies. Then in July 2026, Uranus enters Gemini, creating a rare triad of Fire and Air that electrifies communication, creativity, and financial flow. Suddenly money comes more easily from simply being yourself: from speaking your truth, showcasing your gifts, sharing your weird, unfiltered magic with the world. Throat chakras open, creative channels widen, and opportunities meet you halfway. But this acceleration comes with a challenge: the temptation to move too fast, burn too quickly, and forget the foundations needed to sustain your success.</p>



<p>Because with all this Fire and Air dominating the cosmos in 2026, many of us will feel the urge to leap without looking: to quit the job, impulsively start the business, launch the product, change the career, monetize the art, reinvent every aspect of our lives overnight. And while that instinct is part of the collective medicine, it only works if it’s paired with grounding. True wealth is built through rhythm, through containers, through systems that can hold your expansion. Your task this year isn’t just to dream or to leap; it’s to <em>architect</em>. To create sustainable frameworks for your passion. To invest in the future self you’re becoming through education, mentorship, coaching, real estate, stocks, creative tools, business infrastructure, or values-aligned ventures. Every investment in 2026 echoes for the next decade.</p>



<p>This year’s eclipses deepen the storyline with fated financial and professional turning points. The February 17th New Moon Solar Eclipse in Aquarius (28°) may bring a major opportunity to join or build community. Your digital presence might expand. Your work may reach more people. Yet because it squares Uranus in Taurus, you’ll need to check in with your values and avoid spaces that don’t fully resonate. Then on March 3rd, the Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo pushes you out of your comfort zone professionally, revealing where you’ve been settling, playing small, or overworking. Many will quit jobs, request raises, restructure workflows, or choose rest to reclaim balance.</p>



<p>Later in the year, the August 12th Total Solar Eclipse in Leo arrives as a creative rebirth, especially potent for artists, performers, and entrepreneurs. This is the moment to launch, to reveal, to be seen. And finally, the August 28th Partial Lunar Eclipse in Pisces delivers emotional, intuitive, serendipitous blessings… the kind of blessings that feel like miracles. This is where dreams break through the material realm.</p>



<p>But perhaps the most important theme of 2026 is this: authenticity becomes currency. Pluto in Aquarius and Uranus in Gemini harmonize throughout the second half of the year, inviting us to embrace our eccentricities, our quirks, our rare inner genius. The world is saturated with imitation. What people crave — and pay for — is truth. Your weirdness is your wealth. Your originality is your open door. This is the year where posting that unfiltered IG dump, sharing the opinion no one else dares to say, or releasing the art only you could create becomes the catalyst for financial and spiritual expansion. When you stop hiding your true self, the opportunities meant for your true self finally find you.</p>

<h2>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Aries, 2026 is literally <em>your</em> era. Like, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/02/11280107/main-character-trend-tiktok-aesthetic-lifestyle"">main-character-walks-in</a>-and-the-crowd-goes-silent energy. With Saturn and Neptune both in your sign, you’re stepping into a cosmic bootcamp that’s half discipline, half dream alchemy. Saturn, the planet of responsibility, is teaching you how to build structures that actually protect your fire instead of dimming it. Neptune, the planet of compassion and creativity, is reminding you that money comes when your heart is in the room. The secret to your financial growth this year is the fusion: fun and consistency.</p>



<p>If your creativity felt stale or if your finances dipped last year, it wasn’t because you lost your magic — you were in spiritual hibernation, healing things nobody saw. Now Saturn wants you to create a rhythm, a workflow, a “don’t-burn-yourself-out-this-time” container. And Neptune wants you to actually enjoy what you’re building. Think: turning your passion project into a real business, but doing it in a way that feels like play. Aries is discovering that “grown-up money” doesn’t have to feel boring… it can feel like freedom.</p>



<p>Starting July 7th, Uranus in Taurus leaves your financial sector (since 2018 it was giving “one month I’m up, next month I’m down, next month I’m manifesting rent from thin air”), and enters Gemini, your communication zone. Translation: your <em>voice</em> becomes a revenue stream. The more you speak, write, teach, post, present, or share your unfiltered Aries takes… the more money finds you. This is “launch the Substack,” “start the podcast with your bestie,” “post that TikTok even if your hair isn’t ‘ready’,” “finally write the ebook,” and “accept that panel invitation you think you’re not qualified for.” Uranus in Gemini is literally begging you to diversify your income like a bold entrepreneur. You’re suddenly generating ideas faster than you can type them. And the best part? People actually listen. Your words hit, your humor lands, and your authenticity magnetizes opportunities you used to pray for. This is the year where an Aries rant goes viral and changes your life.</p>



<p>The plot thickens on March 3rd with the Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo, activating your work, routine, and health sector. This eclipse is basically your cosmic intervention. Something in your day-to-day workflow has been draining you… unhealthy pacing, lack of boundaries, doing everything alone, micromanaging every detail, eating lunch at 4pm because “you forgot” (Aries… <em>please</em>).</p>



<p>The eclipse pulls the curtain back and forces you to see what you’ve outgrown. It may look like quitting a job that’s low-key been shrinking your spirit, delegating tasks you’ve  been gatekeeping, switching industries, taking a sabbatical, or simply restructuring your routine so you’re not sprinting through your life every day. It’s uncomfortable but liberating, and it clears the path for actual abundance. Then the August 12th New Moon Solar Eclipse in Leo enters like the grand finale of a Beyoncé concert, activating your creativity, your romance, your fame sector. Something you create within six months of this eclipse could skyrocket your visibility. A passion project becomes a revenue stream. A hobby becomes a brand. A “just for fun” idea becomes the thing that makes everyone say, “Wait… you did THAT?”</p>



<p>And through all of this, remember: you’ve earned this era. Saturn and Neptune spent years in your spirituality and closure sector, dragging you into self-reflection mode, forcing you to heal wounds you never had time to acknowledge. That wasn’t punishment… it was preparation. Now they’re in your sign saying, “Rise.”</p>



<p>Aries is one of the zodiac’s biggest winners in the Fire Horse year and the numerology One year. The universe is literally asking you to initiate the life you’ve been imagining, not in a reckless way, but in a <em>visionary warrior</em> way. You are the hero of your story in 2026, and money flows where courage meets consistency. When you stop playing small with your gifts and start structuring your brilliance, everything changes for the better. This is your year to build the foundation of a life that feels both prosperous and true. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828721.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Taurus, 2026 is the year the universe lovingly pushes you out of your comfort zone and into your calling. With Saturn and Neptune in Aries activating your spirituality and healing sector for the next two years (and Neptune for over a decade), your relationship to money becomes more soulful, more intuitive, and more values-driven. You’re realizing that your financial expansion is directly tied to your spiritual alignment. Many Tauruses will feel called toward work that heals, guides, restores, or uplifts, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2022/05/10982731/too-much-therapy"">whether that’s therapy</a>, astrology, Pilates teaching, Reiki, intuitive coaching, wellness work, or even starting a “soft-life” content platform rooted in emotional wisdom.</p>



<p>And if you’re already in these fields, Saturn blesses you with the discipline to structure your offerings, raise your rates, and stop apologizing for charging what your gifts are worth. Neptune meanwhile whispers: “It’s okay to be spiritual <em>and</em> well-paid.” And if you’re in a corporate path that feels spiritually dead, you may feel an unmistakable urge to leave — like your soul is tapping you on the shoulder saying… “We’re done here.”</p>



<p>And then comes the cosmic plot twist: Uranus finally leaves your sign in July after eight roller-coaster years that rocked your identity, finances, relationships, and stability. Many Tauruses went through job losses, career pivots, moves, breakups, breakthroughs, glow ups, and reinventions during Uranus in Taurus… the universe basically sent you through “unstable earth sign bootcamp.” But on July 7th, 2026, Uranus enters Gemini, activating your money and income sector, and suddenly the pressure eases. You start feeling… lighter. More curious. More open to experimenting with new streams of income.</p>



<p>Uranus prefers the airiness of Gemini, so this shift feels like the universe finally cutting you a break. BUT, the catch is: you cannot control your money flow the way you used to. Uranus in Gemini makes money feel like a game of cosmic ping-pong: ideas flying everywhere, inspiration hitting at random times, unexpected deposits, unexpected opportunities, unexpected collaborations. The more flexible you are, the more fun you have with it, the more wealthy you become. Taurus’ biggest challenge will be letting go of rigidity and letting your money breathe. Treat it like play, not punishment.</p>



<p>Financial blessings begin early, though, particularly around the Full Moon in Sagittarius on May 31st, which activates your wealth, investments, and shared resources sector. Something you initiated or dreamed about during Sagittarius Season 2025 could manifest in a major way. This is prime energy for payouts, inheritances, scholarships, royalties, business investments bearing fruit, or finally getting approved for something you’ve been waiting on. It’s also a good period for debt reduction or consolidation, financial healing, and calling in support from outside sources without shame.</p>



<p>Then, the August 8th Partial Lunar Eclipse in Pisces lights up your community, technology, and networks sector, meaning one online moment could change everything. A post goes viral. A connection leads to funding. A collaboration expands your audience. A LinkedIn update brings job offers. Or you join a community that ends up opening doors you didn’t even know existed. This eclipse is loud about the importance of being seen and sharing your art, your wisdom, your story, your gifts — especially online.</p>



<p>And yes… all of this becomes so much easier once Uranus leaves your sign. The first half of 2026 still carries that “final exam” energy — the kind where the universe asks, “Did you learn how to adapt or nah?” But by the second half of the year, you genuinely feel like your head breaks above water for the first time in years. You’re calmer, clearer, more intuitive, and more confident in your worth. You stop clutching your money out of fear and finally begin circulating it with trust. You stop hiding your gifts and start monetizing them with integrity. And above all, you surrender your tight grip on control and let abundance come the way it wants to. 2026 is the year where Taurus finally exhales and says… “Wow. My time really has come.”</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828722.jpg?width=852&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=213%3A256"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Gemini… 2026 feels like someone finally opened the window and let the light pour back into your life. With Saturn and Neptune in Aries entering <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/age-gap-friendship-benefits-different-generations"">your friendship, networks</a>, and tech sector, you’re stepping into an era where your connections, your community, and your ability to “just show up and play” become your greatest financial assets. The professional fog of the past few years finally lifts. Saturn in Pisces had you second-guessing your purpose, doubting your abilities, and working behind the scenes in ways that didn’t always offer immediate results. Now Saturn in Aries gives you structure through collaboration, and Neptune gives you soul through community.</p>



<p>Your money this year is directly tied to networking, sharing your gifts publicly, being seen, and letting your natural charisma circulate. Healing modalities, community organizing, digital platforms, group projects, and social-media-based entrepreneurship explode for you. You’re not meant to do 2026 alone… your revenue streams literally expand through your relationships.</p>



<p>The first major breakthrough arrives around the February 17th Aquarius Solar Eclipse, lighting up your expansion, travel, and higher-learning sector. This is the eclipse that could put you on a plane, in a classroom, on a stage, or in an entirely different timezone. Whatever intentions you set around this eclipse — studying something new, launching a business, traveling for work, relocating, applying for visas, accepting opportunities abroad, pursuing entrepreneurship, enrolling in a certificate — will directly link to your income over the next six months. Think “international checks,” “global clients,” “remote work upgrades,” or “publishing something that reaches way more people than expected.”</p>



<p>You’re not meant to think small this year… Aquarius energy demands liberation. And then Jupiter stations direct in Cancer on March 10th, unblocking money flows, dissolving limiting beliefs about earning, and helping you trust your value again. This is when you stop undercharging, under-selling, or underestimating yourself. Money begins moving again.</p>



<p>But the real spotlight moment arrives when Jupiter enters Leo on June 30th, lighting upyour communication sector and saying, “We can’t let you hide anymore.” Jupiter in Leo amplifies your voice, your humor, your content, your aesthetic, your intelligence, and your creative output. People notice you. They want to hear you speak, read your writing, buy your products, or engage with your work. Opportunities come from podcasts, panels, TikToks, Instagram reels, newsletters, courses, vlogs, workshops… basically anything that allows you to share your brain and your brilliance.</p>



<p>Jupiter in Cancer had you stacking coins behind the scenes. Jupiter in Leo puts you center stage. And it harmonizes beautifully with Gemini energy — so shining feels natural instead of forced. There’s also massive financial potential through media, publishing, presentations, collaborations, and anything that involves your voice or visibility. You are literally being asked to take up space.</p>



<p>The most powerful awakening arrives during the August 28th Partial Lunar Eclipse in Pisces, activating your career sector. This is the culmination of something you began six months prior, around the Pisces New Moon. And unlike the last few emotional Pisces eclipses, this one comes with clarity — thanks to the full moon being ruled by Jupiter in Leo (your communication sector) and Neptune in Aries (your tech and community sector). Your creative desires, your public image, and your community support suddenly click together like puzzle pieces. You may land a dream role, launch a major project, go viral, receive recognition in your industry, or pivot into a career that aligns with the childlike version of you who always knew what you were meant to do.</p>



<p>This eclipse can push you forward <em>even if you’re not ready</em>, because your soul is ready. The shadow of this year? Uranus in Gemini brings genius downloads, but also unpredictability. Your mind changes fast, your plans shift suddenly, and people may struggle to keep up. Your task is to check in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10751082/should-you-trust-your-gut-instinct"">with your intuition</a> before making promises or financial commitments. As long as you don’t over-promise, you’ll thrive. With the right balance of freedom plus consistency, 2026 becomes one of the most exciting and lucrative years Gemini has had in a long time.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828723.jpg?width=852&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=213%3A256"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Cancer, 2026 begins with the universe practically spoiling you. With Jupiter, the planet of luck and expansion, in your sign for the first six months, you’re walking around with a cosmic spotlight on your gifts. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10751082/should-you-trust-your-gut-instinct"">Your intuition is sharper</a> than ever, and your money magnetism is off the charts. Anything rooted in your identity — your story, your culture, your softness, your nurturing, your humor, your aesthetic, your home — becomes a business opportunity. Home-based businesses thrive. Careers involving children, healing, cooking, interior design, real estate, food content, wellness, and lifestyle influencing thrive. If you’ve ever wanted to be a conscious influencer, write a book, launch a podcast, lead circles, teach something, or build a brand around the way <em>you</em> move through the world… this is the year. Because here’s the secret: your authenticity is your currency.</p>



<p>The more you let previously hidden parts of yourself express themselves, the more abundance arrives. Don’t overthink it. Share what you love and let people see you. Then, the plot twist: Saturn and Neptune join forces in Aries, activating your career sector for the next two years — and Neptune stays over a decade. This is huge. Saturn in Pisces had you drifting, daydreaming, doubting, waiting for “signs” or “perfect timing,” and often being too passive about your ambitions. But Saturn in Aries? That’s a whole new era. It’s saying, “You’re done playing small.” Neptune in Aries reawakens your childhood dreams about what you wanted to be. Saturn then gives you the discipline, structure, and stamina to <em>actually</em> pursue them. Leadership roles, public speaking, creative direction, entrepreneurship, management, becoming the face of something, stepping into authority you didn’t think you were ready for — all of this becomes available. You will feel seen in ways that feel both thrilling and a little uncomfortable. But uncomfortable doesn’t mean wrong. It means growth.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Uranus in Taurus continues shaking up your community, friendships, and technology sector until July 7th — which explains why networking, job applications, referrals, and social connections have felt inconsistent or unpredictable these past seven years. People drifted out. People appeared suddenly. Collaborations dissolved or transformed. When Uranus enters Gemini, your spirituality and subconscious sector awakens dramatically. You may uncover financial fears, scarcity beliefs, ancestral money wounds, or internal narratives that have been quietly running the show. But instead of spiraling, you reinterpret wealth as a multidimensional experience: health, family, safety, joy, creativity, nourishment, emotional fulfillment. Ironically, the moment you stop chasing traditional versions of success and start embracing this spiritual definition of abundance… actual material abundance increases. Your aura softens. Your voice strengthens. People trust you more. Money follows authenticity.</p>



<p>And then comes the financial fireworks. Jupiter enters Leo on June 30th, staying for 13 months, blessing your finances, self-esteem, and earning ability. And topping it all off, the August 12th New Moon Total Solar Eclipse in Leo supercharges a six-month financial rebirth. This is a full-on Leo stellium in your money zone, making Cancer one of the most prosperous signs of 2026. Raises, new jobs, brand partnerships, speaking gigs, real estate wins, viral moments, sold-out offerings, unexpected checks… it’s all on the table.</p>



<p>But here’s the catch: you must stop hiding. Jupiter in Leo wants you center stage. Saturn and Neptune in Aries want you leading. If you retreat into your shell during the biggest glow up of your career, you block blessings. The life hack? Every time you want to shrink, ask yourself: What’s one small step out of the cocoon I can take today? Slowly expand your capacity to shine. Fall in love with the money journey, not just the outcome. Abundance wants you — and for once, you’re fully ready to want it back.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828724.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Leo… this year was practically written for you. A numerology 1 year, a Fire Horse year, and the arrival of Saturn and Neptune in Aries, a fellow Fire sign? This is cosmic synergy. Saturn gives you discipline, structure, and long-game strategy, while Neptune gives you imagination, purpose, and dream-blueprints — and both are activating your expansion, education, and exploration sector. Translation: life wants you to stretch, to risk, to evolve, and to invest in your next level. You’re no longer meant to coast on natural talent alone… you’re being asked to deliberately sharpen your gifts, develop your craft, study what excites you, and say yes to opportunities that expose you to people, places, and possibilities you once thought were “too big.” The fire energy of 2026 (plus Uranus entering Gemini later in the year) lights you up with inspiration, but Saturn keeps you grounded in what actually works. You’re stepping into a year where your ambition is finally matched by cosmic support — but consistency is the key that unlocks it.</p>



<p>Before the spotlight finds you, though, there is a sacred preparation happening. For the first six months of 2026, Jupiter is in Cancer, activating your spiritual, intuitive, and healing sector. This is your incubation period… your chrysalis. You may feel quieter, more reflective, more inwardly focused, and more <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-protect-your-peace"">protective of your peace</a> and energy. Old fears around visibility, self-worth, or deservingness may rise to the surface so they can be released. Jupiter in Cancer shows you the parts of your identity you’ve been hiding, dimming, or underestimating.</p>



<p>All of this emotional groundwork becomes crucial, because when Jupiter enters Leo on June 30th for a 13-month stay… everything accelerates. Suddenly, you’re magnetic. Booked. Center stage. Abundance comes from simply being yourself — boldly, colorfully, unapologetically. What you learned in your quiet season prepares you to receive, hold, and manage the Golden Era that’s coming. Jupiter in Leo is a financial glow up, but it’s also a soul glow up. The more you know who you are, the more the universe can amplify you.</p>



<p>Then comes the moment that changes everything: the August 12th New Moon Total Solar Eclipse in Leo: your cosmic rebirth. This eclipse is your personal reset button, a full-on identity upgrade. Reinvention is not just allowed; it’s inevitable. If you’ve been craving a rebrand, a new creative direction, a shift in industry, a move, or a change in how you present yourself to the world, this eclipse opens the door. Many Leos will start the year making money one way and end the year making it through a completely different, more aligned avenue. Eclipses don’t ask for permission; they accelerate what your soul already chose. If you’ve been secretly wanting to pivot from corporate to creative, from artist to entrepreneur, from behind-the-scenes to center stage, this eclipse is the ignition. With Jupiter in your sign, you’ll have the confidence, charisma, and visibility to make it happen.</p>



<p>But the real anchoring energy of the year comes from Virgo. First, the March 3rd Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo highlights your money, values, and self-worth sector, revealing the financial habits, insecurities, or patterns that need to shift for your wealth to stabilize. Then, on September 10th, we get the first non-eclipse Virgo New Moon in over a year. This is the moment everything clicks. After months of expansion, opportunities, attention, and abundance from Jupiter in Leo, this Virgo New Moon gives you the practical clarity to organize your finances, budget wisely, build systems, and protect your wealth.</p>



<p>Remember Leo: Jupiter expands everything — including spending, indulgence, lifestyle inflation, impulsive purchases, and diva moments. The shadow of your 2026 is thinking you’re unstoppable and forgetting to manage your money. The cure? Virgo discipline. If you take this Virgo New Moon seriously, you end the year not just wealthier… but <em>wealth-stable</em>. Leo’s biggest lesson of 2026 is this: you’re allowed to shine, but you must also steward the light.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828725.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Virgo, 2026 is the year your spirit finally exhales. The March 3rd Total Lunar Eclipse in your sign — on the ascension portal of 3/3 — is the continuation of a cycle that has relentlessly reshaped your relationship with yourself. These Virgo–Pisces eclipses have pushed you to release identities, habits, roles, and financial dynamics that were draining you. They forced you to confront the places where you were over-giving, undercharging, overworking, or tolerating responsibilities that weren’t yours to carry.</p>



<p>This penultimate Virgo eclipse brings clarity, closure, and reclamation. Suddenly, the rejections, delays, endings, and redirections of the past two years start making sense. Jobs that are draining you end. Financial agreements without reciprocity dissolve. And most importantly, you finally outgrow the “comfort zone income ceiling” you unconsciously created for yourself. This eclipse shows you how much more you’re capable of earning — and how deeply you deserve it. Asking for raises, charging more, setting boundaries, leaving unfulfilling roles… it all becomes easier.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Saturn and Neptune enter Aries, joining forces in your shared resources, investments, and generational wealth sector. Neptune will stay for over a decade, Saturn for two years, meaning you’re entering a profound money-mastery era. Saturn gives structure to your long-term financial plans; Neptune gives intuitive guidance and imagination. Together, they ask you to stop downplaying your potential and start building real wealth.</p>



<p>This is the perfect time for Virgos to explore conscious investing, real estate, entrepreneurship, high-yield savings accounts, grants, accelerators, stock or bond portfolios, crowdfunding, or even collaborative income partnerships. You are being initiated into the world of financial expansion… not through hustle culture, but through strategy and alignment. If you’ve ever dreamt of building long-term security, passive income, or generational wealth, Saturn and Neptune are saying “Now.” The only requirement is that you stop being shy about wanting abundance. You’re meant to have more.</p>



<p>The energy shifts dramatically in the second half of the year with Jupiter entering Leo on June 30th and the August 12th Solar Eclipse in Leo, both activating your spirituality, closure, and subconscious sector. This may seem confusing at first… just when you’re gaining confidence, the cosmos asks you to go inward again. But this is essential.</p>



<p>Jupiter in Leo illuminates where your ego, fear of judgment, or longing for external validation may have been steering your financial decisions. Are you pursuing something because it looks good on paper, or because your soul wants it? Are you chasing visibility, or peace? The Leo eclipse encourages a deep reinvention of your motivations. If your money goals are rooted in self-love rather than proving yourself, then the abundance that comes in the second half of 2026 will feel effortless. If they’re rooted in comparison or insecurity, the universe will gently redirect you back to your inner truth. This is a heart-centered recalibration.</p>



<p>And then comes the biggest plot twist: Uranus enters Gemini on July 7th, activating your career sector for more than seven years. If you’ve been craving change, creativity, or a career that feels alive… buckle up. Uranus brings unpredictability, yes, but also genius breakthroughs, unexpected opportunities, nonlinear trajectories, and reinventions you didn’t even know you wanted. You may get multiple offers at once, switch industries, take on roles you never imagined, or build a career path with no precedent. For a Virgo, this can feel like a nervous-system roller coaster, but in truth, it’s the liberation you’ve been quietly praying for. You’ve been bored. You’ve been ready for more. Now “more” arrives in the form of surprise. If you treat 2026 like an adventure instead of a test, you will discover new income avenues you never would’ve considered. This year is not about control, it’s about trust. And deep down, Virgo, you are more ready than you realize.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828726.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Libra, 2026 is the year your relationships become your greatest financial portal. With Saturn and Neptune in Aries in your partnership, collaboration, and contract sector, you’re entering a long-term cycle where your abundance is directly tied to who you build with, who you trust, and who you choose to walk beside. Saturn will be here for two years, refining your standards, boundaries, and commitments. Neptune will remain for over a decade, helping you attract soul-aligned collaborators, clients, partners, and supporters.</p>



<p>Some Libras may literally <em>marry into wealth</em>, join forces with a romantic partner financially, start a business with someone, or find that the right professional ally completely transforms their income. Others will discover that setting boundaries in draining partnerships instantly shifts their money flow. You’re learning that relationships are not just emotional ecosystems… they’re also energetic and financial ones. When your partnerships are aligned, your wealth expands.</p>



<p>At the same time, Scorpio energy becomes a quiet but powerful money-making ally this year. Any Scorpio transit — Scorpio Moon days, Mercury in Scorpio, Venus in Scorpio, Mars in Scorpio, and of course Scorpio Season — activates your income and self-worth sector. Translation: Q4 may be your strongest financial quarter of the year, even if the first two or three feel more preparatory. But before the rewards arrive, you must move through the final initiation of Uranus in Taurus, which stays at 29 degrees until July 7th.</p>



<p>Uranus has been shaking your shared resources, inheritances, debt, grants, loans, investments, and generational wealth sector since 2018, bringing wild fluctuations, unexpected payments, unpredictable expenses, financial awakenings, and deep fears to the surface. These final months are the “exam” phase: releasing scarcity programming, renegotiating debt, restructuring financial agreements, letting go of survival mode, and stabilizing your money foundation. Once Uranus leaves Taurus, the turbulence stops. But you must consciously close the chapter.</p>



<p>On July 7th, Uranus enters Gemini, activating your expansion, publishing, travel, and higher learning sector, and suddenly, life becomes wide again. Uranus in Gemini is an Air sign blessing, giving you wings. After years of financial shadow work, you finally feel energized enough to travel, study, teach, write, publish, relocate, return to school, or broadcast your ideas. And here’s the magic: these expansion moves directly increase your wealth. Courses you take pay off. Content you publish brings opportunities.</p>



<p>Traveling puts you in rooms with people who hire or invest in you. Teaching, writing, lecturing, coaching, creating, or launching digital products becomes profitable. But there’s a shadow: Gemini energy can overwhelm you with options. You might say yes to too many opportunities, overbook yourself, take on too many subscriptions, or accidentally live beyond your means because life finally feels exciting again. You’ll have to practice discernment — something you’re capable of, but only when they slow down.</p>



<p>And then the glow arrives. Jupiter enters Leo on June 30th, followed by the New Moon Solar Eclipse in Leo on August 12th, activating your friendship, tech, and community sector for 13 months. This is one of the luckiest transit combos Libras have had in years. Your social circle expands, your online presence grows, and friendships bring financial opportunities. Networking becomes natural during this transit and your content is more likely to go viral.</p>



<p>The second half of 2026 is overflowing with invitations, ideas, and possibilities…almost too many. Your task is to choose the few that actually align with your values, bandwidth, budget, and long-term vision. Libra’s financial superpower this year is selectivity. The life hack: <em>sometimes less is more.</em> Ground yourself during the Earth seasons (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) to stay anchored while the Air and Fire energies sweep you into expansion. If you protect your peace, honor your limits, and trust your intuition, 2026 becomes the year your partnerships elevate you into a completely new income bracket.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828727.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Scorpio, 2026 is the year you come back to life with fire in your eyes. After Neptune and Saturn spent the past few years in Pisces activating your pleasure and romance sector, you were deep in emotional renovation mode: healing wounds, shedding karmic spending patterns, dissolving creative blocks, and confronting the extremes you sometimes swing between (either clutching onto every penny or impulse-spending like money grows on Pluto). But this year is a Fire Horse year, a numerology 1 year, and Saturn and Neptune move into Aries, activating your sector of work, routine, health, and daily mastery. Aries is ruled by Mars, your planetary ruler. This is a cosmic caffeine shot to your system.</p>



<p>Saturn gives discipline. Neptune gives vision. Together, they pull you out of your hibernation and say: <em>“It’s time.”</em> Time to work differently, lead differently, earn differently, and show up in a way that aligns with your highest self. Your financial growth this year comes directly from acting more like an Aries: bold, unapologetic, experimental, and willing to try again even if you change your mind. No more hiding.</p>



<p>No more waiting until you feel “ready.” The universe wants you moving — imperfectly, passionately, consistently. The year opens with a massive turning point: the March 3rd Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo, an ascension gateway occurring in your community, collaboration, and networking sector. This eclipse reveals how much wealth is tied not just to what you do, but who you do it <em>with</em>. Scorpio is often fiercely independent, but this eclipse makes it undeniable: community is currency. Digital workshops, in-person retreats, healing circles, online courses, speaking opportunities, group programs, co-led offerings — these are your gold mines. People want to learn from you and be guided by you.</p>



<p>People trust your insight, your leadership, your spiritual authority. As you invest in nurturing community, you’ll notice a direct increase in income. And only one week later, Jupiter stations direct in Cancer on March 10th, activating your expansion, entrepreneurship, media, and travel sector. From March through June 30th, entrepreneurial ventures stabilize. Educational projects gain traction. Publishing, teaching, writing, creating online content, or running your own business from home all become surprisingly lucrative.</p>



<p>The May 1st Full Moon in Scorpio is your personal wake-up call: a moment of “Okay…I’m done blocking my own blessings.” This full moon activates your identity and purpose, pushing you to embrace your brilliance instead of hiding it out of fear or perfectionism. Then, on June 30th, Jupiter enters Leo for 13 months, and your career becomes the hottest, brightest zone of your chart. Jupiter in Leo demands visibility: public roles, leadership positions, creative projects, management responsibilities, bold new titles, and industry recognition.</p>



<p>And the August 12th New Moon Total Solar Eclipse in Leo only amplifies this. Within six months of this eclipse, many Scorpios hit a major milestone: launching a dream project, getting promoted, going viral, receiving funding, or reinventing their public identity entirely. It’s a fiery, high-stakes, high-reward era — and yes, it can feel overwhelming after years of softness and introspection. But you asked for transformation. You asked for momentum. And now the universe is delivering it at full force.</p>



<p>The final act of the year brings both shadow and reward. On October 3rd, Venus retrogrades in your sign, temporarily slowing your money flow so you can examine your deeper relationship with receiving. Scorpio is a master giver but can struggle with letting abundance in without suspicion, fear, or guilt. Venus retrograde helps you soften those defenses. Then, on November 13th, Venus shifts direct, just in time for Sag Season to activate your money sector. This is your harvest period. Everything you built during the first half of the year, everything you stabilized during Jupiter’s shift direct in Cancer, everything you dared to reveal under the Leo eclipse… comes back to you multiplied.</p>



<p>By the end of 2026, you understand that sustainable wealth is built like Scorpio magic itself: through devotion, depth, passion, and repeated practice. Saturn and Neptune in Aries remind you that showing up consistently is what creates prosperity. This isn’t the year you hide your power… this is the year you <em>own</em> it. The year your work becomes aligned, your confidence becomes unshakeable, and your abundance becomes inevitable.</p>

<h2>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Sagittarius, 2026 feels like finally running at full speed after years of feeling like you were jogging through molasses. Saturn and Neptune are joining forces in Aries — a Fire sign like you — during a Fire Horse year, a numerology 1 year, and you’re <em>literally</em> a centaur. This is cosmic power stacking. Saturn gives you the discipline to harness your fire, and Neptune gives you the vision to direct it with purpose. Aries energy ignites your creativity, courage, entrepreneurial sparks, and willingness to take action instead of waiting for “the perfect moment.” This is a year of unapologetic momentum for you. You’re thinking bigger, taking risks, and betting on yourself. And unlike the past few years when timing felt off or the universe seemed to slow you down, 2026 finally puts wind behind your arrows. You’re being pushed into your next era of financial mastery… not through force, but through fiery alignment.</p>



<p>Before the explosion of opportunity arrives, the first six months come with an intimate, profound money lesson. Your ruler Jupiter is in Cancer, activating your shared resources, intimacy, and generational wealth sector. This is about the inner healing that allows you to truly hold abundance. Jupiter here helps you release fears around inconsistency, past financial wounds, and patterns of overgiving or undercharging. You may restructure debt, renegotiate financial partnerships, or become more intentional with investing and long-term planning.</p>



<p>The year’s visionary turning point arrives early: the February 17th New Moon Solar Eclipse in Aquarius, activating your communication, ideas, voice, and values sector. This eclipse, combined with Pluto in Aquarius, is your radicalization era — in the best way. It asks you to stop watering down your truth in order to be palatable. Your money this year is tied to how boldly, honestly, and rebelliously you express your values.</p>



<p>Sagittarius is already known for truth-telling, but in 2026, your authenticity becomes your brand. Whether you’re pitching a business, creating content, speaking publicly, or negotiating your worth, the more you show up in your realness, the more the universe aligns opportunities that match who you <em>actually</em> are. This eclipse sets off a six-month storyline of breakthrough communication, but because the Aquarius eclipse cycle continues into 2027, the values you claim now will become the foundation of your long-term financial path. And the June 29th Full Moon in Capricorn — in your income sector — brings the mid-year payout you’ve been building toward quietly. Something slow, steady, and grown-up you’ve been working on finally pays off.</p>



<p>And when Jupiter enters Leo on June 30th for a 13-month cycle, everything changes. This activates your expansion, travel, entrepreneurship, and publishing sector — your home turf. Suddenly, the world opens up. You feel bolder, brighter, and more willing to put yourself out there. Asking for more money becomes easier. Accepting leadership roles becomes natural. You stop settling for anything that undervalues your skills, your brilliance, or your range. Jupiter in Leo turns you into the version of yourself who says:“If I desire it, why can’t I have it?”</p>



<p>The second half of the year is fiery and fast thanks to Jupiter in Leo, but with fire comes temptation: burnout, overcommitment, overspending, or chasing external validation disguised as success. Capricorn Season arrives like a grounded exhale. Starting in late December 2026 — after Venus retrograde shadow periods have cleared and eclipse intensity settles — you gain clarity on what truly matters. Capricorn energy helps you refine your systems, budget with intention, streamline your workload, and realize that you don’t need to do the absolute most to earn the absolute most. Sagittarius often equates “more effort” with “more outcome,” but 2026 teaches you the opposite: less is more. Rest is strategy. Alignment is efficiency. The universe is saying: <em>You can chill and still be blessed.</em> The end of the year is where you recognize that your abundance grows when your actions are values-led rather than validation-led. And that shift is what makes 2026 one of your most transformative financial years to date.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828729.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Capricorn… 2026 is a year of profound recalibration — the kind that only happens when your chart ruler shifts signs. Saturn, your cosmic boss and anchor, leaves Pisces and enters Aries, activating your sector of roots and values. Saturn stays here for two years, while Neptune joins for over a decade, blending practicality with visionary intuition. This is a major energetic shift: Pisces had you drifting, dissolving, dreaming, healing, grieving, and letting go. Aries puts fire back in your system. Suddenly there’s urgency, clarity, initiative, and a desire to rebuild your foundation with a different level of intentionality.</p>



<p>With Saturn in Aries, you stop procrastinating. You stop tolerating mediocrity (internally or externally). You begin building new habits that are actually sustainable. And Neptune helps you lead with inspiration rather than obligation. It’s a “reconstruct your life from the ground up” year — not from fear or scarcity, but because you’ve outgrown the old version of yourself.</p>



<p>The first major turning point arrives early: the February 17th New Moon Solar Eclipse in Aquarius, activating your income sector — the start of a brand-new eclipse cycle that continues for the next two years. And with Pluto in Aquarius now settled in your money zone for nearly 20 years, your entire financial philosophy is transforming. This is the year you stop relying solely on traditional, linear, “safe” routes to wealth. Aquarius wants innovation, disruption, experimentation. Think: New currency, new tools, new industries, new ways of earning and thinking.</p>



<p>You may surprise yourself by wanting to invest in cryptocurrency, explore stocks and bonds, back someone’s startup, join an accelerator, pivot careers, learn coding, adopt AI tools, or build a digital asset you never thought you’d feel comfortable with. Aquarius energy activates your inner strategist <em>and</em> your inner rebel. And the eclipse may force your hand by dissolving an outdated income source or revealing something misaligned. The universe is saying: “The old structure won’t sustain you anymore — build the new one.”</p>



<p>Then comes the shift you’ve both dreaded and needed: Uranus leaves Taurus on July 7th, ending eight years of unpredictable, karmic lessons in love, pleasure, fate, and creative purpose. That transit shook your sense of identity, security, romantic patterns, and artistic voice. But when Uranus enters Gemini, it activates your work, service, and routine sector for the next 7-plus years. Your daily life becomes more flexible, surprising, unconventional, and mentally stimulating. Your income may come from multiple streams instead of one stable source. Work hours may shift, job roles evolve, and your relationship with consistency changes entirely. This can feel disorienting at first… as you love stability, but Uranus also opens your world. With Uranus in Gemini, you’re invited to align your money mindset with your curiosity instead of duty. It’s a cosmic permission slip to loosen your grip.</p>



<p>For the first six months, Jupiter is in Cancer — boosting your partnerships and professional alliances. Money comes through people, through agreements, through teamwork, through shared visions. Then on June 30th, Jupiter enters Leo, lighting up your shared resources, investments, inheritance, loans, grant funding, venture capital, and generational wealth sector for 13 months. This is a wealth-generation portal, especially with the August 12th Leo New Moon Solar Eclipse also activating this part of your chart. If you ask for money this year, people say yes. Investors say yes. Banks say yes. Clients say yes. Collaborators say yes.</p>



<p>This is the time to pitch yourself boldly, ask for raises, negotiate salaries, restructure debt, apply for funding, or strategically expand your financial ecosystem. But the  deeper spiritual lesson is trust. In 2026 you’re learning that controlling everything doesn’t create safety… <em>alignment does</em>. When you release your need to micromanage every outcome, synchronicities multiply. When you stop gripping, blessings land easily. 2026 is the year you learn that wealth is not just a plan, it’s a divine collaboration with the universe.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828730.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Aquarius, 2026 is the year the universe hands you the mic and says, <em>“Your era starts now.”</em> The February 17th New Moon Solar Eclipse in your sign officially opens the Aquarius–Leo eclipse axis for the first time in nearly a decade, and because Pluto is in your sign for 19 more years, this isn’t just an eclipse… it’s a coronation. Your identity, your voice, your authenticity, your weirdness, your genius — <em>that</em> is your currency now. All you really have to do to attract more wealth this year is show up as yourself and keep exploring who that self is becoming.</p>



<p>But the New Moon will square Uranus in Taurus, your modern ruler, which may trigger a feeling of instability as you attempt to choose a financial path. You may not want to choose. You may want to reinvent. You may have sudden changes at work, sudden shifts in direction, sudden realizations about what no longer fits. That’s okay. This eclipse is clearing the slate so you can write a new, innovative financial script — one only an Aquarius could dream up.</p>



<p>But before the reinvention stabilizes, you must navigate the final stretch of Uranus in Taurus, which remains in your home, roots, and emotional foundation sector until July 7th. Uranus at 29° Taurus shakes the ground beneath your feet one last time: housing transitions, family dynamics shifting, unexpected changes in living arrangements, or emotional instability that makes it difficult to focus on money. The message? <em>Your home has to evolve for your wealth to evolve.</em> Create stability where you can: simplify your space, strengthen your routines, anchor your nervous system, because the external may continue to fluctuate. Once Uranus enters Gemini in July and activates your creativity, dating, and pleasure sector for 7+ years, everything changes. You stop trying to force stability through seriousness and realize your abundance is directly tied to joy. As you play more, you profit more. As you say yes to what excites your inner child, money flows in through the side door. Your ruler in a fellow Air sign feels like oxygen after eight years underwater.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Jupiter is doing major heavy lifting for your partnerships and your wealth. For the first half of the year, Jupiter in Cancer activates your work and service sector, which makes you more emotionally sensitive at work and easily overwhelmed by routines. But on June 30th, Jupiter enters Leo for 13 months, lighting up your partnership, collaboration, and connection sector. This is not a solo year. Your wealth increases when you align yourself with people who hype you up, empower you, challenge you, or amplify your voice. Whether romantic or professional, collaborations become gold mines.</p>



<p>Jupiter in Leo dissolves your lone-wolf tendencies and says, “Work with people who make you feel more confident, not less.” And the August 12th Leo New Moon Solar Eclipse seals this truth: you may meet a divine collaborator — a soulmate client, a creative partner, a romantic partner, or a benefactor — who boosts your wealth within six months. This is the first Leo eclipse in nine years, and it reactivates a deep destiny around who you share your energy, time, and resources with.</p>



<p>Then we reach the grand finale: the August 28th Pisces Full Moon Lunar Eclipse in your income sector. This is the last Pisces eclipse for years, and a culmination of intentions set around the March 18th Pisces New Moon earlier in the year, especially if you started or expanded a home-based business at that time. This eclipse could bring a major payout, your first large client, a viral moment, a grant, a raise, a royalty check, or an unexpected windfall. It’s not logical — it’s magical. Pisces eclipses bring blessings you dream of before they appear.</p>



<p>Your task in 2026 is to stop fixating on <em>how</em> money will come and start embodying the version of yourself who already has it. Wealth is not just currency; it is frequency. Gratitude, joy, ease, creativity, softness, imagination — these are your financial tools now. Make a mood board of your wealthiest self. Listen to the music they would love. Dress the way they would dress. Play the way they would play. The more you embody abundance, the more easily it finds you. 2026 is the beginning of your Pluto Era — and that means your power, your voice, and your wealth are only going up from here.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828731.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Pisces, 2026 begins with a sacred exhale. For years, you’ve had both Saturn and Neptune in your sign — a once-in-a-lifetime transit that forced you to confront your identity, your boundaries, your purpose, your fears, your softness, and your sensitivity. From 2023 to early 2026 you were reshaped, rebuilt, rebirthed. And in January and early February, as Neptune leaves Pisces on January 26th and Saturn follows on February 13th, you integrate the <em>final degree lessons</em>: emotional maturity, energetic discernment, self-worth, and spiritual clarity. The first month of the year isn’t about money at all… it’s about shedding the old version of yourself. You’re clearing illusions, releasing martyr tendencies, and renouncing the idea that you have to suffer or sacrifice to be deserving. But then February arrives, and everything changes.</p>



<p>As soon as Saturn and Neptune enter Aries, your money, self-worth, and financial stability sector lights up like a switch being flipped. Suddenly, you stop seeing money as something “worldly” or “impure,” and start seeing it as a <em>spiritual ally</em>. Pisces realizes they can be abundant, ethical, generous, and powerful — all at once. Saturn brings structure so you don’t get swept away by unrealistic optimism; Neptune brings imagination, intuition, and a deep trust that the more aligned you become, the more supported you are.</p>



<p>This combo births a new financial identity: the Pisces who invests, who saves wisely, who builds systems, who negotiates confidently, who no longer undercharges, who believes they can be a benevolent billionaire if they choose. And when Jupiter, your planetary ruler, stations direct in Cancer on March 10th, your intuitive knowing around money decisions becomes crystal clear. What felt blocked for months now starts flowing again: creative income, entrepreneurial ideas, financial momentum, and self-trust.</p>



<p>The next major shift comes mid-year when Uranus leaves Taurus and enters Gemini on July 7th. For eight years, Uranus in Taurus activated your communication and erratic spending tendencies, sometimes scattering your focus or creating unexpected financial fluctuations. Now, Uranus moves into your home, family, and domestic sector, bringing surprises: moves, relocations, home renovations, family expansions, or sudden household expenses. This requires a budget, emotional boundaries, and clear financial planning, because your generous Pisces heart could easily be pulled into rescuing family or giving beyond your means during this transit.</p>



<p>At the same time, Jupiter enters Leo on June 30th and begins a 13-month journey through your health, routine, and service sector. This is when you realize <em>wealth without</em> <em>wellness isn’t worth it.</em> 2026 asks Pisces to take their physical health seriously — movement, rest, appointments, nutrition, grounding practices. Jupiter in Leo also encourages you to hire support: a money coach, a financial planner, a mentor, or someone who can teach you the systems you never learned. You don’t have to figure everything out alone.</p>



<p>And then comes your quantum leap. The August 12th Leo New Moon Solar Eclipse invites you to commit to a new era of financial responsibility and self-respect. Then, on August 28th, the year’s final eclipse — a Pisces Full Moon Partial Lunar Eclipse — becomes your liberation moment. This eclipse reveals how you’ve been standing in your own way: holding onto past money mistakes, believing outdated narratives about scarcity, letting fear slow you down, or waiting for perfect clarity before taking action. This is your release and rebirth. By the September 26th Full Moon in Aries, you feel ready to launch something major, claim opportunities you once felt unworthy of, or receive blessings you prayed for years ago. 2026 is your financial renaissance — not because you hustle harder, but because you believe in yourself more deeply than ever before. You’re no longer rebuilding your identity… you’re expressing it, confidently, abundantly, and unapologetically.</p>

<p>I watch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/entertainment"">a lot of TV.</a> It’s my job. And in all my years of b<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/binge-watching-habit-meaning-psychology"">inge-watching shows</a> for a living, I have never seen so many viral videos of people <a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-season-3-watch-party-blue-haven-nyc-scene-report"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">gathered together in bars simultaneously yelling</a> in reaction to major TV moments than I have this year. In the age of streaming, appointment TV was back and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/love-island-usa-watch-parties-community"">watch parties were bigger</a> than ever. Whether it was <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@loveislandusa/video/7520444252002848055?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nicolandria’s Soul Ties kiss</a> (IYKYK), the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11934118/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-finale-ending-explained-review-belly"">king of yearning Conrad Fisher</a> finally getting his happily ever after, or a <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSe15yhDuu1/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">grand gesture from a gay hockey player</a> no one saw coming, TV lovers came together this year to obsess over their fave ‘ships and root for their beloved characters. And it was beautiful to witness. </p>



<p>In a year that felt endlessly chaotic and packed with horrific headlines, TV stepped up as our most reliable emotional support system. 2025 gave us shows that made us scream-text the group chat, cancel plans for<em> just one more episode</em>, and rethink everything from love, to friendship, to what counts as a satisfying finale. Whether you were into <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/07/203712/best-2000s-shows-platinum-age"">prestige dramas</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cozy-christmas-movies"">comfort watches</a>, or genre shows that completely rewired the formula, this year’s best TV did not disappoint. Below are the series that defined our screens, our moods, and cured our collective cultural brain rot.</p>



<p>These picks come straight from the watchlists (and our unhinged yet professional Slack chats) of Refinery29 editors. The criteria isn’t “high-brow only,” it’s <em>did this show fully consume us?</em> From series that demanded our full attention to reality TV that went from chaotic to comforting to culturally essential, we’re honoring the full spectrum of what great TV looks like. If it sparked a debate, delivered a meme, or made us feel something unexpectedly real, it earned its spot. </p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq8x47ky2Tw"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Pitt </a></em></strong></h2>







<p>For some reason, I was never into Grey’s Anatomy, Scrubs, ER, or any of the popular hospital dramas even during their streaming resurgences. But after everyone from family to strangers recommended watching <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11936018/the-pitt-season-2-characters-storyline-release-date"">The Pitt</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11936018/the-pitt-season-2-characters-storyline-release-date""> </a>(starring and executive-produced by ER’s very own Noah Wyle) and being bombarded with interviews of Wylie talking about how his nurse mom influenced the storyline for more accurate depictions of what it’s actually like to work in a hospital, I finally gave in. And wow, was I stunned. </p>



<p>Each of the 15 episodes represent one hour of a consecutive 15-hour emergency room shift. It’s fast-paced and chaotic but has moments of levity, and manages to dive deep into each of the doctors, nurses, and residents’ eccentricities and back stories. I found myself instantly hooked and invested into the core doctors and incoming patients, no matter how likeable, unlikeable, long, or short their storylines were. The heavy, high-strung, high-stakes series is a must-watch. But to warn you, it is certainly not a show to wind down to after a hectic day!<em> <strong>– Victoria Montalti, Senior Fashion Writer</strong></em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.peacocktv.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Love Island USA</a> </em>Season 7 </strong></h2>







<p>When an Irish friend first introduced me to <em>Love Island </em>via the show’s original UK iteration in 2022, I was equally horrified and intrigued by the sheer logistics of it all. The idea of committing to a show that airs a new episode six nights a week for two and a half months straight — featuring a revolving door of 30-or-so contestants and their constantly recalibrating romances — was a lot to wrap my head around. But, as someone who deeply appreciates lowbrow reality TV both as a form of sociological fieldwork and, obviously, for pure eye candy, I was up for the task. </p>



<p>This year, <em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hZpwgKjOkY"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Love Island USA</a></em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hZpwgKjOkY"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> season 7</a> brought the country together in ways seldom seen before, becoming a full-blown cultural phenomenon that revived the glory days of participatory reality TV. My roommate and I grew closer as we watched and voted together each night (and shrieked in horror at the show’s absolutely unhinged challenges). My colleagues and I raced to our Slack channels each morning to share hot takes. Even in New York City, where people famously mind their business, I’d find myself talking about the show with a friend on the street or subway, only to have strangers jump in mid-conversation to share their opinions.</p>



<p>What ultimately made season 7 feel like a classic was (most of) the cast’s emotional vulnerability. It gave us a hero’s arc in Amaya Papaya (née Espinal), who brought a rare level of authenticity and sensitivity to reality TV, a friends-to-star-crossed-lovers romance in Olandria and Nic, healthy debates about what it really means to be “a girls girl,” and enough memes to last a lifetime (Mamacita, anyone?). <em><strong>– Lia Tabackman, Senior Social Media Manager </strong></em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@hbomax/video/7583017214677241119"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Heated Rivalry</a></em></strong></h2>







<p>I’m going to start with a quote from <em><a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/heated-rivalry-hbo-max-gay-drama-hockey-players-hit-women-1236456083/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Heated Rilvarly’s</a></em> creator, writer and showrunner, Jacob Tierney: “Putting queer sex on the screen in a celebratory and sexy way is not common at all… people were clearly craving that kind of thing,” <a href=""https://theankler.com/p/i-think-heated-rivalry-deserves-emmys"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tierney told The Ankler</a>. “They wanted to see sexually alive, queer people in a way that we kind of self-censor and don’t always do. I don’t think the show is popular despite the horniness; I think it’s popular because of the horniness.” Exactly. Recently, TV and film have been oddly sexless, seemingly scared to show erotism on screen and convinced audiences don’t want to see pretty people kissing. I beg to differ.</p>



<p>I’ve been pushing the horny TV agenda for years and finally, here comes a show to match my freak. But it’s not just about the beautifully tender, explicit, real, and <em>hot </em>sex scenes, <em>Heated Rivalry </em>contains some of the most heartfelt and romantic storytelling I’ve ever seen on TV. And that’s only after five episodes! I am already unhealthily obsessed with this show and I can’t wait for more. As someone who belongs to multiple romance book clubs, I’m so happy that a show based on a romance novel (written by Rachel Reid) is getting the love it deserves. Plus, a show about gay hockey players airing in 2025 — when male athletes would still face so much prejudice, homophobia, and an extremely hard time if they came out IRL — is not only bold and brave, it’s revolutionary. – <em><strong>Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Senior Content Director, Entertainment </strong></em><br /></p>

<p>I admittedly didn’t watch much TV this year, but there was one show that had me in a chokehold: Season 3 of <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty.</em> To be honest, I didn’t particularly enjoy this season. As Team Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno), a lot of it was insufferable, mostly because Conrad (Christopher Briney) remains an unbearable character to watch. He’s going to talk down to Belly (Lola Tung) and make her feel crazy for years AND do his brother like that, and they still want me to believe he’s not the villain in this show? (You ain’t gaslighting me, Connie Baby!). I also couldn’t stand the way the writers seemed determined to assassinate Jeremiah’s character. Still, to paraphrase a Taylor Swift lyric, Jenny Han really puts narcotics into all of her episodes, because no matter how much I wanted to look away, I just couldn’t. <em>– <strong>Raquel Reichard, Director of Somos</strong></em></p>

<p>When I first started <em>The Hunting Wives</em>, I wasn’t prepared for what I signed up for. I assumed I would be watching a show about wives getting back at their cheating husbands. I was right, but also so wrong. I spent most of the time being mad at the main character Sophie (Brittany Snow), literally rolling my eyes at the screen at her antics. That said, I will be back for Season 2. –<em> <strong>Dawnie Jefferson Production &amp; Editorial Coordinator</strong></em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/secretlivesonhulu/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives </a></em></strong></h2>







<p><em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSky3regZqi/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives</a> </em>was my favorite TV show of 2025 because it didn’t just understand the assignment, it overdelivered. TWO seasons in one year? Bravo could never. By breaking the fourth wall and letting the off-screen drama (hello, Fruity Pebbles) bleed into the show, it captured the same raw magic as early Vanderpump Rules seasons, back when the cast wanted fame at any cost and didn’t know, or care, to hold anything back.</p>



<p>Season 3 was filmed before Season 2 even premiered, giving us something almost unheard of in reality TV: reunions being taped, press tours unfolding, and cast dynamics shifting in real time as they reacted to public opinion. The timeline was messy, but for reality fans, that level of transparency was all we’ve ever wanted.</p>



<p>We watched marriages implode, secret affairs surface, and learned way too much about their sex lives. Not every storyline worked (the sexual assault allegations were uncomfortable and difficult to watch), but the drama was balanced by something real: raw, unprocessed trauma shared in a way that genuinely resonated.</p>



<p>Taylor Frankie Paul becoming the Bachelorette only cemented the show’s chokehold on pop culture, while Whitney Leavitt started the year as the ultimate villain and ended it as the main character of<em> Dancing with the Stars </em>and getting cast as Roxie Hart on Broadway. The range! And all of this unfolded in the hyper-specific, endlessly fascinating playground of Swig sodas, Utah curls, and Mormon culture—proof that you don’t need alcohol for reality TV gold.<em> – <strong>Taylor Loren, Social Strategist </strong></em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/81418639"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Forever</a> </em></strong></h2>







<p>Mara Brock Akil’s <em>Forever</em> feels like it was made specifically for me — for the 16 year old version of me who needed to see herself, who longed for stories that reflected Black girlhood and humanity and the complexity of being a Black kid in a white space — and that’s only partially why I loved it so much. For the teenager in me who was messily figuring out her sexuality, Keisha and Justin would have been my fictional best friends. For the thirty-redacted grownup who needed an escape and just loves romance, <em>Forever</em> delivered in-depth, nuanced explorations of how sex can be absolutely everything and sometimes nothing at all. </p>



<p>Listen, I’m too grown to believe that representation will save us, but it does matter. And what this show represents (Black kids falling in love and finding themselves) is portrayed in such a caring, thoughtful way that as you fall in love with Keisha and Justin, as a Black person, you can’t help but love yourself more. This show loves us. It finds beauty in Blackness, in the nuances and flaws of youth. It lets Keisha be complicated and messy and Justin be introspective and vulnerable; two things that Black girls and boys aren’t typically allowed to be on TV. This show is my wildest dreams come true. It’s the show I wish I had when I was a teenager and I’m so grateful that Black teens get this show now. <strong>– </strong><em><strong>Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Senior Content Director, Entertainment </strong></em><br /></p>

<p><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/01/10828529/abbott-elementary-show-review-quinta-brunson"">Abbott Elementary</a></em> is my comfort show when I want to just laugh and <em>not have to think</em>. I can usually jump into any episode in the season or binge several of the 22-minute episodes and still understand what’s happening. In the same style as cult-favorite comedies like<em> The Office</em> and <em>Parks &amp; Rec,</em> this workplace “mockumentary” follows the staff of a Philadelphia elementary school and captures all the drama and antics you’d expect to happen during everyday life—in and out of school. The show is currently in the middle of season five and we see teachers Janine and Gregory’s relationship continue to develop. A few of the recent episodes have taken the setting out of the school, but my favorites are usually when the teachers and staff, especially Principal Ava Coleman and teacher Ms. Melissa Schementti, are just trying to get through the school day. For me, it’s easy sitcom watching. <strong>–</strong><em><strong> Lisa Dionisio, Newsletter Director</strong></em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/81427733"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Beast In Me</a></em></strong></h2>







<p>If I were putting together a dream team of prestige TV, I would immediately call up Claire Danes and Matthew Rhys for my starting five. Danes proved in <em>Homeland</em>, and throughout her storied career, that she can do a chin quiver like no other, and that there is no emotion she can’t convey through the careful crumpling of her face. And Rhys, along with his real-life wife Keri Russell, showed on <em>The Americans</em> that he can make even the most ethically-questionable character someone you can’t help but be intrigued by. In <em>The Beast In Me</em>, these two heavyweights come together for some of the best TV of the year. </p>



<p>Both Danes and Rhys are so compelling in <em>The Beast In Me, </em>you won’t be able to look away for all eight episodes. Danes brings her signature emotional precision, playing every flicker of doubt and defiance like a controlled burn, while Rhys does what he does best: make moral ambiguity feel devastatingly human. Together, they create a push-pull dynamic that’s an unsettling dissertation on good versus evil and what happens when the lines between the two start to blue. Their chemistry isn’t flashy; it’s claustrophobic, simmering, and kind that makes silence feel louder than dialogue and turns every shared glance into a threat. It’s prestige acting without the self-importance, and it’s exactly why the show gets under your skin and stays there. – <em><strong>Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Senior Content Director, Entertainment </strong></em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaDFty5ipEg"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Buccanneers</a> </em>Season 2</strong></h2>







<p>This past summer, I was indulging in some YA love-triangle drama and watching <em>TSITP</em> and<em> The Buccaneers</em> Season 2 on Apple TV. If you’re not familiar with The Buccaneers, it’s a period drama set in 1870s England following five gorgeous American women trying to find titled husbands and independence. Season 2 tries to resolve a love triangle set up in Season 1 between Nan, Guy, and Theo. New affairs and betrayals between the couples develop, and it’s guilty-pleasure watching, especially for period romance fans. Spoiler warning: season two ends in another cliffhanger but the show’s already been greenlit for a season three.<em> <strong>– Lisa Dionisio, Newsletter Director</strong></em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://tubitv.com/series/300014710/the-z-suite"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Z Suite </a></em></strong></h2>







<p>I know Tubi gets a bad rep for its content, but do NOT sleep on them. I loved everything about the Z Suite! The characters were fun. The plots were full of shenanigans. It fueled the Gen Z vs. Millennial fire in a way that leaves you with the idea, “we are more alike than different”. It had a sense of true comedic whimsy, while many other shows are just too serious. I am unsure if it will be renewed for another season, but I sure hope so! –<em> <strong>Dawnie Jefferson Production &amp; Editorial Coordinator</strong></em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.disneyplus.com/en-ca/browse/entity-2b4b8988-50c9-4097-bf93-bc34a99a5b4f"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Paradise </a></em></strong></h2>







<p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jan/28/paradise-review-disney-a-whodunnit-with-wit-heart-and-sterling-k-brown""><em>Paradise</em></a> is a mystery series starring Emmy winner Sterling K. Brown about a secret service agent whose president is murdered and it’s so good, it got renewed for a <a href=""https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/a64208545/paradise-season-2-news-date-cast-spoilers/"">second season</a> halfway into its first. So I’m just going to quote myself from March writing about <em>Paradise</em> just after it was renewed: “We’re in an age where a show with a Black lead gets written off by online trolls as ‘<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/02/11253627/woke-meaning-co-opted-politics"">too woke</a>’ or full of ‘<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/03/11844306/hollywood-dei-rollbacks-black-actors-cast-reboots-racism"">DEI hires</a>’ and anything that makes us feel our feelings gets denigrated as ‘silly.’ But the absurdity and sincerity of <em>Paradise</em> is its strength. And its hero? A Black man, the descendent of a Tuskegee airman and Black pilot, who took a bullet for the president, may feel a bit too nationalistic for the current moment, but it also harkens back to a time when that guy was the hero everyone welcomed, and the one TV wanted. Right now, Sterling K. Brown as Xavier Collins is the hero we need.” – <em><strong>Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Senior Content Director, Entertainment </strong></em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.cbs.com/shows/ghosts/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ghosts</a></em></strong></h2>







<p>This year marked Season 4 and 5 of <em>Ghosts</em>, and it is consistently one of my favorite comfort watches. I literally force anyone who comes to my house to watch it with me. Season 4 gave the characters so much more backstory. Season 5 adds to that. If you want a good, wholesome chuckle, you should definitely watch this show. –<em> <strong>Dawnie Jefferson Production &amp; Editorial Coordinator</strong></em></p>
