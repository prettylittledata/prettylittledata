The rooms were expanded towards the original courtyard, and a covered, wooden outdoor playground was added in the front.

Its rules are as simple as they are intelligent: simple openings alternate with box-type windows set at different depths in the concrete structure. The elementary moments of the architecture are realised in this way: rhythm, plasticity and self-chosen order come together to form a façade that gives the address and the ""Grande Armée - l1ve"" project a strong physiognomy.</p>",

His head is tilted slightly forward, and the background is plain and light, keeping the focus on his face."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jIlOmpINB0KlHodPMK5CZg.png"" /><figcaption>James Baldwin</figcaption></figure><p><strong>What’s the balance between protection and control?</strong></p><p>Early on, the difference is hard to see. A rule tightens, choices narrow, and it still feels like someone watching out for us. But the moment we’re told which questions are acceptable, the story stops being something we believe and becomes something we’re permitted to follow.</p><p><em>I’m </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/natesowder/""><em>Nate Sowder</em></a><em>, and this is </em><strong><em>unquoted, installment 14</em></strong><em>. This week, we’re looking at</em><a href=""https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-Baldwin""><em> James Baldwin</em></a><em> and the dynamics of controlling systems.</em></p><h3>Baldwin before Baldwin</h3><p>James Baldwin grew up in Harlem in the 1930s, in a neighborhood where the church was often the only institution offering structure, identity and a sense of direction. His stepfather was a preacher… strict, volatile, convinced the world was dangerous and that discipline was the only defense against it. Baldwin was taught early that love and fear could sound the same from the pulpit, and that protection could arrive in a tone that felt indistinguishable from control.</p><p>By adolescence, he was already <a href=""https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/james-baldwin"">writing</a>, already watching, already noticing how authority behaves when it’s anxious. He saw how parents and pastors tightened their grip (not because they were strong, but) when they were afraid… afraid of the world outside, afraid of losing their children to it, afraid of questions that didn’t have answers prescriptively laid out.</p><p>The punchline is that Baldwin left the church, but he never stopped studying its logic: the way belief gets inherited, the way fear gets institutionalized (let that sink in), and the way people learn to live inside systems that claim to protect them while shaping them into something… relatively insignificant.</p><p>What made Baldwin, <a href=""https://press.princeton.edu/ideas/james-baldwins-reckless-idea?srsltid=AfmBOoq3aGh7HlIOybdMwX47r4Ou62HOfMIWk2vdBNKZ2AiU4RtFowoI"">Baldwin wasn’t doctrine or theory. </a>Instead, it was his ability to see how systems (families, churches, nations, etc.) reveal their deepest insecurities in how they try to keep people “safe”. And how, in doing so, they confuse protection with control until the two become nearly indistinguishable.</p><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white photo of James Baldwin standing in a dim room with one hand on his hip. He faces the camera directly, framed by a cluttered mantel on the left and a stacked bookshelf on the right. Drawings, books, and papers fill the space around him, giving the room a lived-in, intellectual feel. The light casts his shadow across the wall behind him."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nSgJEuyNPhgi6gSGa3mJAg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>James Baldwin in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France, in 1979. Photo: Pierre Boulat/Cosmos</figcaption></figure><h3>What Baldwin saw</h3><p>What Baldwin carried out of that childhood was clarity about how authority behaves when it feels uneasy. He noticed that the strictest rules often appeared when the people enforcing them felt threatened. When grips tightened, it wasn’t because the world required it; it was because the adults in charge didn’t know what to do with their own uncertainty.</p><p>He grew up watching beliefs passed down without examination, repeated out of habit, fear, or duty. Questioning them didn’t feel dangerous because of the ideas themselves, it felt dangerous because of what those questions exposed: How fragile the underlying certainty really was.</p><p><a href=""https://theconstitutionalist.org/2021/08/19/learning-to-love-like-james-baldwin/"">Baldwin learned that control often exposes the very vulnerability it intends to hide.</a></p><p>This became the thread running through his work. Whether he was writing about families, churches, or nations, he kept returning to the same observation: Systems that depend on obedience are rarely confident in their foundations. They appeal to safety, stability, or virtue, but what they are really protecting is the comfort of not having to reconsider themselves.</p><p>Baldwin didn’t need to catalogue every rule or doctrine. It was sufficient enough studying what people do when they’re afraid to face their own reflection.</p><h3>When fear becomes policy</h3><p>The dynamics Baldwin observed in the church weren’t confined to pulpits or families. You can see the same architecture anywhere a system confuses order with virtue and obedience with stability. Some cultures call it tradition, others morality, and some simply call it policy. But the structure is identical: fear becomes the rationale, and protection becomes the excuse.</p><p>You see it in countries where dissent is treated as contamination. The state offers “safety” in exchange for silence, promising harmony while making independent thought feel hazardous. Citizens learn to measure their words before they measure their ideas. Over time, people don’t become loyal; they become cautious. And while caution is easy to manage, history has shown this isn’t a foundation for stability.</p><p>You see it in religious movements convinced the world is deteriorating and that only strictness can save the next generation. Rules multiply. Curiosity becomes a liability. Children are raised not to understand their beliefs, but to repeat them as if conviction can survive without the capacity to question. It looks devout from the outside, but inside, it’s a culture afraid of the very people it claims to shepherd — held together by the oldest tool available: shame.</p><p>And you see it in political strategies designed to produce dependency. Systems remove options not because citizens can’t handle them, but because the system can’t. Policies become tight, resources shrink and the message becomes unmistakable: trust us, not yourself. The promise sounds like protection or worse: Equality. The effect feels more like containment, and the longer someone stays inside it, the harder it becomes to imagine leaving.</p><p>Across these contexts, fear has the opposite intended effect. It organizes around compliance rather than unity.</p><p>And compliance, once internalized, becomes something far more difficult to undo than force: <strong>it becomes normal.</strong></p><h3>Why control feels necessary</h3><p>Controlling systems (and people buying into it) rarely see themselves as controlling. They see themselves as managing risk. Uncertainty becomes the problem to solve, and predictability becomes the measure of whether the solution is working. Once that logic takes hold, the system begins to interpret any deviation (any question, new idea, independent choice, etc.) as evidence that the threat hasn’t been contained.</p><p>This is how control becomes rationalized.<br />Not moral, not ideological… <em>rational</em>.<br /> <br />A system anxious about its own stability starts treating unpredictability as danger, even when nothing dangerous is happening. Order becomes a proxy for safety. Obedience becomes a proxy for belonging, and the more fragile the system feels internally, the more rigid its rules become externally.</p><ul><li>In families, this shows up as an insistence that “good choices” are the ones that avoid discomfort.</li><li>In organizations, it shows up as leaders mistaking silence for alignment.</li><li>In societies, it shows up as policies built to prevent change rather than manage it.</li></ul><p>The irony is always the same: The tighter a system tries to hold things together, the more it reveals how afraid it is of letting people grow.</p><p>Control is a thing because a system doubts it can survive… not because a system is strong.</p><p><strong>In the end, control survives not on strength, but on the fear of what might happen without it.</strong></p><h3>The stories avoidance hands down</h3><p>Oddly enough, avoidance isn’t neglect. Avoidance is the explanation of which questions are allowed and which ones should never be asked. Every controlling system depends on stories that make it feel responsible. These are stories inherited so early and repeated so often that questioning them starts to feel like a breach. To Baldwin, these weren’t ideas or lessons. These were boundaries.</p><p>You can probably see where this is going.</p><p>The first layer is <strong>tradition</strong>. It hands us practices and expectations framed as stability. But tradition often survives because it saves people from having to examine what might change if they let themselves reconsider… well… tradition. Avoidance hides neatly inside continuity.</p><p><strong>History</strong> is next. Not as a record, but as a curated reassurance. A society (in power) decides which parts of its past are useful, and arranges them <strong>(or deletes them, as you might notice)</strong> accordingly. Once that arrangement feels authoritative, uncertainty becomes harder to entertain. Questioning the narrative reads as destabilizing, even when the narrative was assembled to prevent destabilization in the first place (if you can believe it).</p><p>Then <strong>morality</strong> steps in to seal the deal. Guidance becomes doctrine, doctrine becomes obligation, and obligation becomes a performance of virtue that relies on predictability rather than understanding. Baldwin saw how easily morality can be drafted into the service of avoidance. <strong>What I mean here, is how often systems reward people not for being thoughtful, but for being steady and compliant.</strong></p><p>And now we have a pattern. Avoidance becomes normal. The stories people inherit teach them to not ask questions. They close the space in which doubt can occur, and treat uncertainty as a sign of <strong>personal failure</strong>. The more these habits embed, the less the system needs to enforce anything. People maintain the limits themselves.</p><p>Baldwin’s clarity cuts cleanly here: O<strong>bedient systems train people to fear questions until avoiding them starts to feel like character.</strong></p><p><strong>If this feels like the moment everything clicks… good. We’re not done.</strong></p><h3>What control really creates</h3><p>Once avoidance becomes the operating logic of a system, something predictable happens to the people inside it: They stop developing the instincts they would need to live without the system’s protection. For Baldwin, this was the tragedy of control. It doesn’t just limit what people can do. It limits what they believe themselves capable of understanding.</p><p>When questions are treated as disruptions, people learn to ignore the parts of their lives that don’t fit the approved story.</p><p>People stop examining their assumptions. They stop trusting their own judgment and stop exploring ideas that might complicate the version of themselves the system prefers.</p><p>You know the consequences better than me. People grow uncomfortable with uncertainty. They choose predictability. They confuse obedience with maturity because obedience is the only behavior the system ever rewarded. And when faced with something that requires imagination, or skepticism, or self-direction, they hesitate…</p><p>I don’t think they hesitate because they lack intelligence. I think they hesitate because of a horrible failure that has taken a really long time to take effect.</p><p>Baldwin’s warning was never about the severity of limits. It was about their effect. <strong>Control produces people who expect someone else to name boundaries for them. </strong>Once that expectation settles in, the system doesn’t need to impose its authority. It simply waits for people to stay inside the lines on their own.</p><h3>The cost of making obedience a virtue</h3><p>The longer a system depends on avoidance, the harder it becomes to see the trade-off being made. Over time, people forget that their certainties were handed to them. They begin to speak as though they reached those conclusions on their own. That’s how avoidance starts looking like conviction.</p><p>This is where I think the damage shows up. Systems built on obedience don’t need to enforce much. People begin to manage themselves long after the original authority fades off. They sidestep questions that would be unsettling to the story they inherited. They’re able to seek out and maintain a stability they never chose and participate in their own containment because the alternative (actual examination) feels disloyal to the world that taught them not to question.</p><p>Baldwin leaves us with a hard truth:<br /><strong>Control doesn’t secure a system; It reduces the scale of the people inside it.</strong></p><p>Once that reduction feels normal, the system has very little to maintain. Avoidance passes from one generation to the next, each one repeating the scripts that make obedience sound eerily similar to maturity.</p><p>We tell ourselves we’re protecting what matters.</p><p>But protection without examination is something else entirely. It’s the refusal to imagine what someone might become if they were trusted with their own questions.</p><p><em>Unquoted is a series about the people and their ideas we can’t afford to forget.</em></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=b1eac97329cd"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-stories-that-keep-us-obedient-b1eac97329cd"">The stories that keep us obedient</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

When I asked, “What problem do these features solve?” silence followed. They could describe what they’d built and how they'd built it. But they couldn’t articulate why any of it mattered to customers.</p><p>It wasn’t incompetence, but rather a loss of clarity in the rush to deliver — a failure of judgment, not execution. I’ve been in that room before — on the other side. I’ve watched teams I led ship features that solved problems no one had previously identified. The hard lesson: executing speed without clear judgment gets you to failure faster. Of course, timely execution remains vital, but discovery judgment has become the actual constraint.</p><p>Teams emphasize that judgment can’t be automated. Yet, AI clearly performs tasks that resemble judgment, such as identifying patterns, flagging contradictions, and synthesizing insights across dozens of interviews. So what’s the distinction that matters?</p><p>AI excels at <strong>pattern-based reasoning</strong>: recognizing correlations in data, clustering similar themes, and optimizing within defined parameters. Humans provide <strong>meaning-based judgment</strong>: interpreting what patterns signify about real needs, deciding which correlations reveal causation, and determining what’s worth pursuing given purpose and values.</p><p>The Discovery Judgment Framework helps teams systematically develop this capability. This article focuses on the framework’s first component: the 19 judgment points where meaning-based judgment — not just pattern recognition — determines whether teams build the right things.</p><h3>The Discovery Judgment Framework</h3><p>If you’re skeptical about “yet another framework,” that skepticism is earned. You’ve probably worked with Lean, Agile, Design Thinking, Jobs-to-Be-Done, OKRs, and dozens of others. Each contributes value — improving alignment, efficiency, and collaboration. But even the best frameworks cannot substitute for the quality of judgment applied within them. Framework fatigue typically occurs when teams adopt them without developing the judgment to use them effectively.</p><p>The <strong>Discovery Judgment Framework</strong> is different. It makes invisible judgment visible and systematically developable through four integrated components:</p><ol><li><strong>Judgment Points (Diagnostic)</strong>: Where judgment matters across the discovery-delivery-learning cycle.</li><li><strong>Quality Dimensions (Measurement)</strong>: How to assess judgment quality.</li><li><strong>Core Practices (Development)</strong>: How to strengthen judgment systematically.</li><li><strong>Maturity Model (Progression)</strong>: How judgment capability evolves.</li></ol><p>This doesn’t replace your existing discovery frameworks; it makes them more effective by revealing the quality of judgment they apply.</p><h3>Why These Judgment Points Matter Now</h3><p>As AI makes execution radically faster and cheaper, teams can now build the wrong things at unprecedented speed. What once took six months of misguided effort now takes six weeks, or with AI, six days.</p><p>As Teixeira and Braga (2025) warn in UX Collective’s State of UX in 2025 report, we’re witnessing “a fundamental shift in responsibilities and a transfer of design control from designers to a complex network of algorithms, automated tools, and business stakeholders.” The troubling trend? Teams are “slowly swapping user research for automated A/B tests, and gradually letting the data make decisions on our behalf.” This abdication of human judgment is precisely the problem.</p><p>Judgment density increases as AI accelerates delivery — the number of consequential decisions teams face per week skyrockets. Improving judgment quality isn’t optional; it’s the only scalable control mechanism for preventing algorithms from deciding what to build.</p><p>Teams committed to better discovery still struggle with a fundamental question: Where exactly do you apply judgment? Which decisions actually determine success or failure?</p><p>AI can now synthesize interviews in minutes, but only humans provide the judgment to interpret what patterns signify and decide what’s worth pursuing. Each judgment point is a moment where AI can either accelerate good judgment or amplify bad judgment. When humans interpret AI-generated insights, bias creeps in — we tend to confirm what we already believe and selectively interpret patterns.</p><p>Consider a typical moment where AI accelerates pattern recognition — but judgment still decides what matters.</p><p>A team building project management software conducts eighteen customer interviews. AI analysis flags that thirteen participants mentioned “estimates are always wrong.”</p><p>The team noticed what AI couldn’t: nine engineering managers were frustrated that their teams underestimated technical complexity, while four product managers were frustrated that stakeholders underestimated scope. Same symptom, opposing causes — one group needs better bottom-up estimation tools, the other needs better top-down scope definition.</p><p>Their decision: Interview three people from each group separately to understand the distinct jobs before proposing any solution.</p><p>AI accelerated pattern recognition from days to minutes. Only humans can judge that identical complaints mask fundamentally different problems that require separate discovery paths. As Gecis (2021) emphasizes in the Jobs-to-Be-Done framework, understanding the underlying “job” customers are trying to accomplish — not just surface-level feature requests — is essential for meaningful product decisions.</p><h3>The 19 Critical Judgment Points</h3><p>I’ve mapped the moments where discovery judgment determines outcomes. These judgment points will continue to evolve as practice deepens. Understanding them gives teams a way to see their reasoning, not just results. Discovery isn’t one decision — it’s a cascade of 19 interconnected judgment calls organized into four domains:</p><p><strong>Framing Judgment</strong>: defining the right problems to solve. Focuses on <em>what</em> and <em>why</em>: identifying customers, uncovering unmet needs, clarifying desired outcomes, mapping assumptions, and aligning on the opportunity worth pursuing.</p><p><strong>Solution Judgment</strong>: exploring and choosing how to solve them. Centers on <em>how</em> to generate and evaluate alternative approaches, balancing feasibility and value, sequencing risks, and deciding what to test first.</p><p><strong>Validation Judgment</strong>: interpreting evidence and learning from experiments. Addresses <em>what’s true</em>: setting confidence thresholds, interpreting results objectively, and deciding when to pivot, persist, or stop.</p><p><strong>Post-Delivery Judgment</strong>: learning from what happens after launch. Closes the loop: selecting which signals to track, recognizing emerging patterns, interpreting success or failure, and feeding insights back into discovery cycles.</p><figure><img alt=""A visual diagram showing 19 critical judgment points organized into four domains: Framing Judgment (purple), Solution Judgment (blue), Validation Judgment (green), and Post-Delivery Judgment (orange). Arrows show how judgment cycles continuously from discovery through delivery and back through post-delivery learning. Each domain contains 4–5 specific judgment points where human reasoning has the most significant influence on product outcomes."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*QXnk5BOUTqwAxF49Yowvjw.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>This diagnostic map illustrates where human reasoning has the most significant influence on product outcomes across four domains: Framing, Solution, Validation, and Post-Delivery. The arrows illustrate how judgment cycles: decisions feed forward through discovery and delivery, and loop back through post-delivery learning.</p><p>Teams don’t always apply all 19 judgment points in practice, but being aware of each one is essential — what’s unseen can’t be improved.</p><p>Here’s how this plays out in real product work.</p><h3>Two Example Judgment Points in Action</h3><p><strong>Scenario</strong>: A cross-functional product team is developing a Team Handoff Tracker — a tool designed to mitigate the chaos that occurs when work “falls between teams.” They’ve heard complaints about tasks “disappearing into a black hole” and assume the main problem is a lack of visibility across departments.</p><h4>1. Assumption Identification &amp; Risk Assessment</h4><p><strong>The judgment</strong>: What assumptions are you making, and which are riskiest?</p><p><strong>Poor approach</strong>: Treat “visibility” as an obvious need. Jump to dashboards and progress indicators without testing whether users actually value visibility.</p><p><strong>Strong approach</strong>: List assumptions explicitly: “Users lack visibility into task ownership,” “A dashboard will solve that,” “Teams will update it regularly.” Test the riskiest first. Result: Users don’t want more visibility — they want more transparent accountability.</p><p>As Krawczyk (2022) notes in his article on identifying product assumptions, teams are susceptible to confirmation bias (the longer it takes to test an assumption, the more we want it to be true) and commitment bias (the more effort we invest, the harder it is to pivot). Making assumptions explicit and testing the riskiest ones first protects against these biases.</p><h4>2. Evidence Interpretation</h4><p><strong>The scenario continues</strong>: Three months later, early pilot feedback appears promising. Users rate the tool “very helpful” and mention “clarity.”</p><p><strong>The judgment</strong>: What does this feedback actually mean?</p><p><strong>Poor approach</strong>: Interpret positive feedback as validation of the visibility hypothesis. Plan feature expansions. Miss that “clarity” meant something different — users valued knowing who to contact, not seeing every task’s status.</p><p><strong>Strong approach</strong>: Review qualitative comments line by line. Ask: “When you say ‘clarity,’ what kind?” Discover that the real need is accountability, not visibility. Pivot to emphasize ownership cues and handoff confirmations.</p><p><strong>Lesson</strong>: If those two judgment points seem small, consider what happens when even one goes wrong.</p><h3>How Judgment Errors Compound</h3><p>These judgment points don’t exist in isolation — they ripple across the system like dominoes.</p><p>A SaaS company interviews only enterprise clients, despite SMBs accounting for 70% of its revenue. This Customer Selection error cascades through Problem Framing, Solution Judgment, Feature Prioritization, and Evidence Interpretation — accumulating $315K over 10 months. The real need could have been validated in three weeks for under $10K.</p><figure><img alt=""A flowchart showing how a single poor judgment decision cascades through multiple stages. Starting with “Customer Selection” error (interviewing only enterprise clients), the diagram shows dominoes falling through Problem Framing, Solution Judgment, Feature Prioritization, and Evidence Interpretation. Each stage shows increasing cost and time investment, ending with $315K spent over 10 months to solve the wrong problem when the real solution could have been validated in 3 weeks for under $10K."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*bJm6WJGE0uzRp6pehjP3GQ.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>Now consider AI’s impact: With AI-powered development, that same cascade might occur in five months instead of 10 months — you fail twice as fast, yet at the same total cost. AI doesn’t make bad judgment cheaper or less damaging — it just accelerates how quickly those judgment errors compound.</p><p>The same cascade works in your favour when early judgment is sound. A clear problem definition shortens solution cycles, tightens validation loops, and compounds learning.</p><p>This is why cross-functional judgment matters — different perspectives catch different errors. Diverse perspectives help teams identify flaws in assumptions and uncover alternative interpretations. A user researcher identifies Evidence Interpretation issues. An engineer identifies Technical Approach problems. A designer notices Problem Framing gaps. A customer success rep recognizes Opportunity Selection misalignment. Each perspective is a checkpoint against cascading failure.</p><p>(In smaller teams, these roles may overlap or not exist as separate positions — one person might play multiple roles. What matters isn’t the org chart, but ensuring these different perspectives inform decisions. The 19 judgment points remain critical regardless of team size or structure.)</p><h3>Discovery as Continuous Practice</h3><p>Most teams treat discovery as a phase; the best treat it as a habit. Discovery doesn’t stop at launch. It’s continuous: discover → deliver → learn → discover again.</p><p>After shipping, teams face a flood of signals. The challenge isn’t finding feedback — it’s making sense of it. Each post-delivery judgment point informs the next discovery cycle: Signal Selection shapes Customer Selection, Pattern Recognition refines Problem Framing, and Learning Extraction improves Evidence Interpretation.</p><p>As Beyer (2025) demonstrates in his guide to Teresa Torres’ Opportunity Solution Trees framework, continuous discovery requires ongoing customer touchpoints and systematic experimentation. Teams that treat discovery as continuous develop judgment faster. Every cycle sharpens judgment for the next cycle’s 19 judgment points. Over time, teams that make these decision points visible move from individual judgment to shared judgment — a collective sensemaking muscle that compounds learning.</p><h3>Assessing Your Team’s Judgment</h3><p>Use this quick self-assessment to identify where your team’s judgment most often falls short.</p><p>Many teams skip several judgment decisions, letting process and habit decide by default. This assessment makes them visible.</p><h4>Framing Judgment</h4><ul><li>Do we validate the problem before building solutions?</li><li>Can we articulate the job our customers are trying to do?</li><li>Have we explicitly mapped assumptions?</li><li>Do we know which customer segments we’re serving and why?</li></ul><h4>Solution Judgment</h4><ul><li>Do we test the riskiest assumptions first?</li><li>Can we explain why we rejected alternatives?</li><li>Do we prioritize based on risk and learning?</li><li>Have we generated multiple solution approaches before committing to one?</li></ul><h4>Validation Judgment</h4><ul><li>Do we interpret evidence objectively?</li><li>Do we have explicit confidence thresholds?</li><li>When we pivot, can we articulate what evidence prompted the change?</li><li>Do we distinguish between what users say and what they mean?</li></ul><h4>Post-Delivery Judgment</h4><ul><li>Do we track the right signals after launch?</li><li>Do we extract learning systematically from outcomes?</li><li>How quickly do we incorporate post-launch insights into the discovery process?</li><li>Can we explain what success or failure taught us about our reasoning?</li></ul><p>Many teams find they’re stronger in some domains than others, and that balance shifts over time. The goal isn’t perfection — it’s visibility and deliberate improvement.</p><p>Focus on the domain that most needs strengthening. For <strong>Framing judgment</strong>: understand the underlying progress customers seek, not just what they say. For <strong>Solution judgment</strong>: generate three distinct approaches before committing. For <strong>Validation judgment</strong>: make confidence thresholds explicit and, as Nousis (2019) demonstrates, systematically test your biggest unknowns. For <strong>Post-Delivery judgment</strong>: track the right signals, extract insights, and feed them back into the discovery process.</p><p>Knowing which parts of your judgment need strengthening is the first step toward improvement — and self-awareness is where progress begins.</p><h3>Your Next Move</h3><p>You now have a diagnostic tool. You can:</p><ul><li>See where your team’s judgment is strong versus where it needs strengthening</li><li>Identify which judgment points you’re skipping entirely</li><li>Trace which judgment points have caused your biggest failures</li><li>Map how poor decisions early cascade later</li></ul><p>Here’s your three-step action plan:</p><ol><li><strong>Review the 19 judgment points with your team.</strong> Identify which points you’re skipping and which have caused your biggest failures.</li><li><strong>Pinpoint the three judgment points that most need strengthening.</strong> Use the assessment questions to diagnose where judgment breaks down most often.</li><li><strong>Choose ONE judgment point to address in your next sprint.</strong> Don’t try to fix everything.

How can we cut through the static to see the real picture?</p><p>Enter academia.</p><p>Over the past five years, numerous academic journal papers have been published about AI and UX design. While the wheels of academia turn slowly, we get a significant trade-off for its glacial pace: objectivity and methodical rigour.</p><p>In other words: a healthy dose of perspective.</p><p>The goal of this article is to summarise academic findings relating to four questions:</p><ol><li>Where is AI being used in the UX design process?</li><li>What are the advantages and drawbacks of using AI in UX design?</li><li>How do UX design practitioners feel about using AI?</li><li>What are the takeaways for future use of AI in UX design?</li></ol><p>The key sources for this article are two <a href=""https://library.leeds.ac.uk/info/1404/literature-searching/15/systematic-reviews"">systematic reviews</a> from 2025: one <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/ahci/3869207"">published in <em>Advances of Human-Computer Interaction</em></a>, and another <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04469"">available on the open-access scholarly platform ArXiv</a>. In total, this article summarises findings from 17 academic sources which are referenced at the end. Typically, these studies base their findings on surveys, interviews, focus groups and other research methods to collect insights from UX and HCI practitioners.</p><p>So forget everything you’ve read from LinkedIn hype merchants, ‘thought leaders’ or doom-mongers.</p><p>Let’s summarise what the science says.</p><h3>1. Where AI is used in the design process</h3><p>The highest usage of AI in UX design is in the <strong>testing</strong> phase, suggests <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/ahci/3869207"">one of our 2025 systematic reviews</a>. According to this paper, 58% of studied AI usage in UX is in either the testing or discovery stage. This maybe shouldn’t be surprising, considering generative AI for visual ideation and UI prototyping has lagged behind text generation.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram showing number of studies looking at AI usage in UX design"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*68bsGgzn3STeRh1mRsJtEA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>AI usage in the UX design process (Luo, 2025)</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s what AI’s commonly being used for in each design stage:</p><h4>Discovery</h4><ul><li>Identifying design problems</li><li>Understanding user needs and behaviours</li><li>Creating user personas</li></ul><h4>Ideation</h4><ul><li>Co-creating solution concepts</li><li>Exploring design alternatives</li><li>Predicting product values</li></ul><h4>Prototyping</h4><ul><li>Generating UI designs</li><li>Converting sketches to prototypes</li><li>Checking for GUI guideline violations</li></ul><h4>Testing</h4><ul><li>Predicting user experience</li><li>Identifying usability issues (e.g. heuristic evaluations)</li><li>Planning and analysing user testing</li></ul><p>In terms of what AI tools UX practitioners are using, here’s a breakdown which is both informative but already slightly out of date:</p><figure><img alt=""Graph showing AI usage in UX design with ChatGPT leading the way"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*prI1D36s13QeOnnQG-taug.png"" /><figcaption>Frequency of AI models used across UI/UX design studies (Ahmed and Imran, 2025)</figcaption></figure><h4>Summary</h4><p>UX practitioners are clearly making use of AI across the design process, with ChatGPT being the most popular tool.</p><p>However, while ideation and prototyping with AI gains a lot of attention, it’s the <em>testing</em> phase where the most studies have examined utilising AI — and it’s also significantly studied in the discovery phase. This disparity may even out as AI continues to improve at generating UI designs.</p><h3>2. Advantages and drawbacks of using AI in UX design</h3><p>I’ve grouped these insights from academic papers into broad themes. You can see that for every benefit of using AI in the UX design process, there are risks and pitfalls to avoid.</p><h4>Speed, cost and quality</h4><p><strong>Advantages: </strong>AI can speed up UX design in numerous ways, from research and ideation to prototyping and testing. For example, it can <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3658619.3658628"">accelerate concept iteration</a> in the early stages of the design process compared to traditional UX methods. This has obvious implications in terms of <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10115412"">reducing delivery timeframes and project costs</a>.</p><figure><img alt=""Seahorse design concept generated by the AI tool Midjourney"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AJ0q0Q62hV8bx5KL984ECQ.png"" /><figcaption>Concept co-creation with Midjourney (Maceli, Smith and Bhakta, 2024)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Drawbacks:</strong> AI generated design ideas can be <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642114"">homogeneous, generic and lacking in consistency</a>, meaning the time and cost of human input must be considered to ensure the final designs are sufficiently distinct and cohesive. (That is, if we care about designing better — or simply good — solutions, and not just <em>faster </em>solutions.)</p><h4>Efficiency versus innovation</h4><p><strong>Advantages: </strong>The use of AI can <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642114"">relieve UX designers from mundane and tedious tasks</a>, allowing them to concentrate on activities that require more critical thinking and emotional engagement. Essentially, there are huge opportunities to offload a lot of grunt work to AI systems. But designers need to be careful about this, because…</p><p><strong>Drawbacks: </strong>Over-reliance on AI designs could lead to <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3409120.3410638"">fixation on minor optimisations rather than out-of-the-box thinking</a>. This means designers need to find a balance between efficiency and innovation — by avoiding dependence on AI where human creativity and agency would add value leading to better solutions.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram showing what AI can and cannot do in the design process"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kAEQ1IPqJKQJX2eDBMU65g.png"" /><figcaption>What AI can and can’t do (Li et al., 2024)</figcaption></figure><h4>Skills and development</h4><p><strong>Advantages: </strong>There’s clear <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3404983.3405506"">potential for AI to lower the skill threshold required for designers</a> in UX. Which makes sense, as prompting is easier to learn than all the features and functionality of Figma. This change allows a wider range of people to contribute design ideas without traditional visual design tool skills.</p><figure><img alt=""Series of sketched, designed and generated UI screens"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1007/1*lKKQRvtXf8KGR-nH2anUPQ.png"" /><figcaption>Sketched input versus manual design and generated AI output (Buschek, Anlauff and Lachner, 2020)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Drawbacks: </strong>Over-dependence on generative AI tools might impede development for UX novices, as <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3615335.3623035"">repetitive tasks help cultivate UX design skills and judgement</a>. Junior designers might be at higher risk of negative cognitive effects from AI generally, as <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/15/1/6"">young people exhibit higher dependence on AI tools and lower critical thinking skills</a>.</p><h4>Summary</h4><p>It’s a mixed bag, basically. For all the opportunities that AI brings to UX design, there are plenty of challenges and traps practitioners can fall into. Some of these issues will be solved by technology improving, but others require skilful and mindful integration of AI into UX design processes.</p><figure><img alt=""Bar chart showing challenges using AI in UX design with hallucinations at the top"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kmOGmOvjO0jbcZVAOwLvGQ.png"" /><figcaption>AI challenges in UX design (Ahmed and Imran, 2025)</figcaption></figure><h3>3. How UX practitioners feel about using AI</h3><p>These are reflections from UX professionals about their experiences of using AI in the design process. I’ve categorised them as either positive or negative sentiments, adding a few comments of my own (in parentheses).</p><h4>Positives</h4><ul><li>Using AI in the design process can make <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/ahci/3869207"">UX practitioners feel both more effective and efficient</a>. (I hesitate to use the phrase ‘super-powered’, as The Incredibles tells us: when everyone’s super, no-one is.)</li><li>Designing with AI helps develop skills in prompting, which is <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04469"">emerging as a core design skill</a>. (It’s surely only a matter of time before we start seeing <em>Prompting is Designing</em> UX books hitting the shelves.)</li><li>Generating design variants with <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3643834.3661624"">AI avoids the ‘blank page’ problem</a>, where UX designers struggle to get started. (Even for professionals, the blank canvas of a design file can sometimes be intimidating.)</li><li>Collaboration with AI can<em> </em>feel like a <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/ahci/3869207"">complementary partnership between human cognition and AI technology</a>. (Similar to a senior designer guiding a junior designer.)</li><li>Using <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3643834.3660703"">AI helps facilitate collaboration with stakeholders</a> by streamlining idea sharing and exploration. (Basically, AI can help make the sometimes arcane practice of UX clearer and more accessible to stakeholders.)</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Four photos from a design focus group on AI, showing people with colourful sticky notes"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1012/1*zmWAQEFMce3Ca1vsl6AkyQ.png"" /><figcaption>Focus group on AI and UX collaboration (Wang et al., 2024)</figcaption></figure><h4>Negatives</h4><ul><li>Designing with AI can also feel like being a <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2024.1404647/full"">client commissioning a contractor rather than <em>designing</em></a>. (In other words: designers can feel like the AI is doing the fun, creative bits while they write the brief.)</li><li>When UX designers feel like they’ve outsourced creative tasks, it can lead to <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3491101.3503564"">diminished sense of ownership over the results</a>. (How invested can you be if you didn’t even draw a single rectangle?)</li><li>Creating an effective prompt can be a <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04469"">time-intensive process with a high cognitive burden</a>. (Although in future this could be mitigated by refining prompting templates and support resources.)</li></ul><h4>Summary</h4><p>The positives outweigh the negatives, but there are clear issues to resolve. This includes UX practitioners’ sense of identity as designers, as well as the time and mental effort required to craft effective prompts, generate outputs and carry out continual refinements.</p><h3>4. Takeaways for future use of AI in UX design</h3><p>I’ve tried to categorise these suggestions into meaningful themes. They typically crop up in the discussion and conclusion sections of academic papers.</p><h4>AI increases efficiency, but people still matter</h4><p>The biggest impact of AI in UX design is the <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/ahci/3869207"">increased efficiency across the design process</a>. However, AI cannot replace human interpersonal communication, collaboration, creativity or originality; therefore it’s important to <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642114"">balance pursuing efficiency while preserving the human-centred nature of UX design</a>.</p><h4>Humans need to remain in the loop</h4><p>UX designers should adopt a <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/discover/human-in-the-loop"">human-in-the-loop</a> approach to validate AI output, improve model performance and <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10034833"">avoid overreliance on automated systems</a>. However, designers should be mindful that <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3512943"">AI tools could potentially <em>reinforce</em> their existing biases</a> instead of challenging them. This is an area where critical thinking skills are absolutely, well, critical.</p><figure><img alt=""Word cloud with prompt engineering, real-time feedback and modular design featuring prominently"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/980/1*RurZhxCwxTpuUlk--9Yg1w.png"" /><figcaption>Word cloud of best practices for AI and UI/UX design (Ahmed and Imran, 2025)</figcaption></figure><h4>AI policies are needed for ethical practice</h4><p>Adoption of AI <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04469"">must be ethical and inclusive as well as efficient</a>. To alleviate concerns about ethics, data privacy, ownership, and accountability, organisations should <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3643834.3660720"">set up and communicate policies on AI usage</a>. Too many UX practitioners are still driving ahead, often alone, without clear internal strategies or policies for generative AI.</p><h4>UX designers need specific AI training</h4><p>To successfully integrate AI into design team processes and workflows, UX practitioners would <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10382802"">benefit from training to develop proficiency</a> in crafting and refining prompts, assessing and criticising AI-generated output, and accounting for AI intricacies and limitations. There’s a world of difference between dabbling with AI in design and using it as effectively as possible.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>So what’s the story? How <em>is</em> AI impacting UX design?</p><p>Well, it’s clear from the academic studies that traditional design methods are being innovated: UX practitioners are harnessing AI, leading to efficiencies and lowering costs for organisations in the process. The benefits are undeniable. UX design has fundamentally changed in the past 2–3 years, and it’s probably career suicide to deny that.</p><p>In fact, more UX designers might need to let go of conventional design stages and activities to <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/ahci/3869207"">allow for even <em>more</em> innovative processes empowered by AI</a>. For example, strictly adhering to established workflows and handover processes ignores the potential to go from concept to functional, testable solution rapidly with AI.</p><p>However, there are potential drawbacks if AI usage in UX design is over-relied on, and used mindlessly. Without sufficient critical thinking, we can easily end up with generic, biased designs that don’t actually solve user problems. In some cases, we might even spend too much time on prompting and vibing with AI when we could have simply sketched or prototyped something ourselves — creating more sense of ownership in the process.</p><p>Many of these findings might feel obvious to a lot of people. But of course the point of rigorous research is often to validate what you <em>think </em>you already know. This deep dive into academia shows us what we really <em>do </em>know, for sure. For now.</p><h3>Sources</h3><p>Ahmed, A. and Imran, A. S. (2025) ‘The role of large language models in UI/UX design: a systematic literature review’, <em>arXiv</em>.

<h4>Is design standing in the way of me showing up in community?</h4><figure><img alt=""A screenshot from TheNapMinistry Threads that says ““Hey, here to say you don’t have to start a project, club, new invention or initiative as we focus on community, connection and the analog world. You can just hang out with your friends, say hello to your neighbor and spend more time offline.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*C7FlVluvY4cAD69gy3ui3g.jpeg"" /><figcaption>A screenshot from <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPkNek0ke20/?hl=en"">https://www.instagram.com/p/DPkNek0ke20/?hl=en</a></figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPkNek0ke20/?hl=en"">I recently saw a post</a> from The Nap Ministry that said:</p><blockquote><em>“Hey, here to say you don’t have to start a project, club, new invention or initiative as we focus on community, connection and the analog world. You can just hang out with your friends, say hello to your neighbor and spend more time offline.”</em></blockquote><p>The post struck a chord in me. I’m often the first to create a themed party or a logo for an event. I love a well-designed gathering with intentional activities and plans. But reading the post, it also made me think about all the times where I got stuck in the planning phase and never got to actually “doing” the thing I was planning in detail because I ran out of time or energy.</p><p>As much as curated spaces, planned interactions, crafted products, and intentional takeaways can enhance experiences and deepen connection, could too much design also stand in the way of us building and engaging in real communities?</p><p>What really happens when we overly design our communities?</p><h3>When we overly design, planning halts action.</h3><p>Planning the perfect event or building the perfect structure can feel productive, but it often becomes a stall. We wait until the idea is polished, until the branding feels right, until the schedule lines up, until we can justify gathering people around something that looks “enough.”</p><p>We often say that design is about iteration, but in practice, the planning and polishing can take over. The more we perfect something, the further we drift from the natural rhythms that actually allow community to form. Real connection needs space to unfold in ways we can’t predict. We don’t know what will happen — and that’s the point.</p><p>Community doesn’t usually grow from perfection. It grows from proximity. It grows from repetition. It grows from the very ordinary act of being around each other without needing a grand reason.</p><p>Sometimes a simple “want to grab a coffee?” is more powerful than a six-part series with a mission statement. Sometimes sitting on the couch while someone cooks dinner does more than any beautifully crafted activation. Sometimes an unplanned walk with a neighbor teaches us more about connection than a structured meetup ever could.</p><p>Starting small keeps the door open. It lowers the stakes. It reminds us that community isn’t something we architect; it’s something we practice. And the more we practice, the easier it becomes to move from idea to action without needing the perfect design as permission.</p><p>If we want more community, the answer is often simple: start where we are, with what we have, and with whoever is already nearby.</p><h3>When we overly design, ordinary engagements can become exclusive clubs.</h3><p>There’s a difference between creating supportive structure and shaping something so tightly that only certain people feel welcome. Over-designing can quietly turn everyday engagements into exclusive clubs, even when the intention is inclusivity.</p><p>I recently read the article <a href=""https://www.notion.so/Designing-or-not-for-community-289649f8ce0b80ff94ede7742537e55e?pvs=21""><em>We’ve Squeezed the “Life” Out of Civic Life</em></a> by Sam Pressler for Connective Tissue, which explores how professionalism can stand in the way of true civic life. He writes:</p><p><em>“When we create ‘spaces’ or build ‘fields’ — as we’ve done throughout the social sector — we end up professionalizing and specializing sets of activities. And when we professionalize and specialize these activities, we signal that these activities are only for some people and not for everyone else. Professionalization and credentialization can help increase the ‘quality’ of practice within a field, but this is done by intentionally erecting barriers to that practice. These barriers show up through the training and credentialing activities themselves, and through the creation of insider cultures, languages, and networks.”</em></p><p>Pressler describes this as “professionalized management,” but it’s also another way of thinking about overly designed community spaces. We build structures to optimize and make things efficient, but when it comes to relationships, those same structures can quietly become obstacles for the dedicated people who were showing up and putting in time from the start.</p><p>He continues:</p><p><em>“The creeping professionalization of civic life has shifted the everyday democracy responsibilities of community membership and participation to the domain of nonprofit management. As credentialed managers assume the roles once held by ordinary citizens and neighbors, formal programs take the place of informal groups and activities, and participation and membership become experiences that are channeled and controlled rather than seen as holistic ways of being.”</em></p><p>When we professionalize or overly design the spaces meant to bring us together, we risk losing the informal, everyday participation that community depends on. Work shifts from ordinary neighbors to credentialed managers. We move from organic connection to structured programs and in the midst of it all, we loose sight on the natural rhythms of relationships. To keep engagement open and alive, we have to leave room for the unpolished, the unplanned, and the people who show up simply because they care.</p><h3>When we overly design, we limit surprise and magic.</h3><p>Many social clubs now have robust brands and curated activities that look more like shopping experiences than the social gatherings we used to know. In the article <a href=""https://grouphug.substack.com/p/what-we-lose-when-optimizing-community""><em>What We Lose When Optimizing Community</em></a>, community builder Elise Granata explores what we lose when we “Shopify” our social lives.</p><p>Run clubs, social retreats, and book clubs use polished online presences to attract members and entice participation. These experiences are meant to support us in the loneliness epidemic, but Granata highlights how their branded, tightly designed nature can create a barrier. We start to feel like we need to know exactly what we’ll get out of something before we go. We scan social accounts and websites to decide if it’s for us. The element of surprise disappears, and we show up expecting an outcome — or as Granata says, <em>“We lose the feeling that comes with a little mystery and a healthy amount of risk.”</em></p><blockquote><em>“When we don’t know exactly what’s going to happen, you know what happens? We get to be surprised.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>— Elise Granata</em></blockquote><p>This focus on expectation can get in the way of simply being with what is and letting curiosity and surprise guide our next moves.</p><p><a href=""https://www.priyaparker.com/the-new-rules-of-gathering"">Priya Parker</a> says every gathering needs a purpose. While I agree in some ways, there’s also a magic in the unplanned spaces that emerge from the natural <strong>rhythms of relationships.</strong> Reading a book while a friend watches reels. Crafting while someone is cooking. “Time together” might be the purpose, but does it really have to be predetermined?</p><p>Sometimes the purpose only emerges after the event has already happened. The people who show up create the purpose together rather than blend into a pre-determined one. Pre-determined purposes can end up placing expectations on what something is and isn’t.</p><h3>Finding the balance</h3><p>One of my guiding practices in design these days is to not only ask <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/from-how-might-we-to-at-what-cost-b635a595afd2""><em>how might we</em> but also <em>at what cost</em>.</a> This helps mitigate unintended consequences. Sometimes the thing we want to design for becomes the very thing we design against if we’re not careful.</p><p>Community, relationships, and connection are messy, unpredictable, and unpolished — and that’s where the magic happens. If we want real connection, we have to leave space for magic to unfold as we just hang out with our friends, say hello to our neighbors, or spend more time offline.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=2b5abca0046a"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/designing-or-not-for-community-2b5abca0046a"">Designing (or not) for community</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>AI for Non-Techies</h4><p>I spent my first week diving headfirst down the Lovable rabbit hole while building my course for<a href=""https://www.moonlearning.io/""> moonlearning.io</a> for non-technies.</p><figure><img alt=""no hype beginner tips"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xMWfpyD76-3hExUc-fUdOg.png"" /></figure><blockquote>Spoiler: I didn’t ship a unicorn before breakfast, but I did come out with a grounded beginner guide to get you started right.</blockquote><p>From the outside, Lovable looks almost too simple: type a prompt, boom, full-stack app.<br />Inside? A whole different ecosystem nobody prepares you for.</p><p>This first week taught me far more than I expected. No hype, no “SaaS in 10 minutes” screenshots, just the parts that genuinely helped me move, build, and understand how the tool actually is set up and behaves.</p><p>Here’s the beginner’s map I wish I had on day one:</p><h3>1. Your first prompt quietly decides your fate</h3><p>Your first prompt matters more than people think. It sets the tone for the entire build. Write it like a mini blueprint:</p><figure><img alt=""promting"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zQFhLxBP7bxN0HOmh_oQOQ.gif"" /></figure><p><strong>What I’m building =</strong> project overview<br /><strong>Who it’s for =</strong> target users<br /><strong>Main pages</strong> <strong>=</strong> app structure + future flow<br /><strong>Key feature</strong>s <strong>=</strong> core functionality + what’s coming later (login, payment…)<br /><strong>Design vibe =</strong> visual direction<br /><strong>What not to do = </strong>guardrails + exclusions<br /><strong>Ask for help = </strong>Tell Lovable to review the prompt and ask questions before building.</p><p>Fill this out with your vision and plan, then ask another LLM, like ChatGPT, to improve it for Lovable use.</p><p>📌 <strong>Extra Tip:</strong> If the first result feels messy or off, <strong>don’t try to rescue it</strong>. Start fresh with a cleaner prompt. It saves time and sanity.</p><h3>2. The Custom Knowledge file is the project’s brain!</h3><p>It's a bit hidden inside your settings, but it's fantastic! You drop in the rules and context you want, and Lovable carries them through everything it builds. You don’t need long essays, just a few sharp lines. Anything you’re sick of repeating goes here, and Lovable remembers it for the whole project. It’s not code. It’s guidance.</p><figure><img alt=""custom knowledge"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pg15n6Oj9xe-LH51nzoLtw.png"" /></figure><h3>3. Learn the modes, or you’ll go in circles</h3><p><strong>Agent Mode → </strong>Builds, refactors, and gets things done.<br /><strong>Chat Mode → </strong>A space to think out loud without touching your code.<br /><strong>Code Mode → </strong>The raw editor when you want full control.<br /><strong>Visual Edit → </strong>Make quick, intuitive changes right on the screen.</p><figure><img alt=""modes"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1oK5UdpohUvQX60OpmFCeg.png"" /></figure><p>The moment you understand when to switch, your stress level drops by half. And yes, it’ll save you some money too, since you’re not burning tokens on accidental work.</p><h3>4. Version history will save your sanity</h3><p>Jump back. Preview. Restore.<br />Edit old messages to explore a different path without trashing your current work. This is the closest Lovable gets to emotional support.</p><figure><img alt=""histiry"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0CO2mUOaGu2tAe8Nzabd3A.png"" /></figure><h3>5. Designers, breathe</h3><p>Visual Edit is not Figma.<br />You’ll get “functional Tailwind energy,” not pixel poetry.</p><p>Good enough to ship is where we’re at.<br />I’m going down the rabbit hole on how to improve this, plus working on a Figma Make course, so make sure you subscribe to my <a href=""https://www.moonlearning.io/newsletter"">newsletter</a>, and I'll be happy to keep you posted.</p><h3>6. Security is surprisingly handled well</h3><p>This used to be my loudest anxiety.<br />Lovable runs a pre-publish health check: exposed keys, weird logic, risky pages… all flagged with explanations and fixes.</p><figure><img alt=""error"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qO9fwumn_NNSnuETcKATaA.png"" /></figure><p>You still need to care, but you don’t start from zero.<br />Dev friends: I’d love your take here, since security isn't my superpower and it matters. So please DO comment!</p><h3>7. Cloud without fear</h3><p>Lovable Cloud runs on Supabase, but you never touch Supabase directly.<br />No dashboards. No wiring. No random SQL from StackOverflow.</p><figure><img alt=""cloud"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uSmw-ispL_jxQN4iOvAJfw.png"" /></figure><p>You just say “Add login” and it sets up the database, auth, tables, storage, and security.<br />Non-tech builders finally unclench here.</p><h3>8. Use AI features with zero setup</h3><p>Summaries, chatbots, translations, sentiment checks, document Q&amp;A — already wired in. (You only pay extra for the LLM usage.)</p><figure><img alt=""integrated API"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Gnch_TKIeCYQuuGLRShD5A.png"" /><figcaption>Ready-to-use APIs in Lovable</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Stripe →</strong> Handles payments for your app.<br /> <strong>OpenAI →</strong> Adds AI features using OpenAI models.<br /> <strong>Anthropic →</strong> Adds AI features using Claude models.<br /> <strong>Resend →</strong> Sends emails through a modern email API.<br /> <strong>Clerk →</strong> Manages users, auth, and identities.<br /> <strong>Three.js →</strong> Builds interactive 3D graphics.<br /> <strong>D3.js →</strong> Creates data-driven visualisations.<br /> <strong>Highcharts →</strong> Produces polished charts and dashboards.<br /> <strong>p5.js →</strong> For creative coding and interactive visuals.<br /> <strong>Runware →</strong> Generates images from text.<br /> <strong>ElevenLabs →</strong> High-quality text-to-speech.<br /> <strong>Make →</strong> Visual tool for automating workflows.<br /> <strong>Replicate →</strong> Runs and fine-tunes open-source AI models.<br /> <strong>Stability AI →</strong> Open-model image generation and more.<br /> <strong>Twilio →</strong> Adds SMS and communication features.<br /> <strong>n8n →</strong> Visual workflow automation with integrations.</p><p><strong>And if Lovable doesn’t support an API yet, you can drop the docs into the chat, and it still hooks it up!</strong><br />As someone who used to fear API integrations… this felt like witchcraft.</p><h3>9. Learn prompting! It changes everything</h3><p>Use <strong>location + behaviour + guardrails</strong>.<br /> “On /settings, add X. It should do Y. Don’t touch Z.”</p><p>Break tasks into small pieces — max three at a time.</p><p>📌 <strong>Magic trick:</strong> add this to your main prompts: <br /><em>“Ask me anything you need to understand this prompt fully.”</em>Lovable slows down, asks questions, and builds what you <em>meant</em>, not what you accidentally wrote. SOOOOOO GOOD!</p><h3>10. Working on it!</h3><p>Any good list has 10 points, right? Well, this is a work in progress!</p><h3>My honest summary after week one</h3><p>A full rollercoaster.<br />At first, it feels like magic.

<h4><strong>As AI mirrors how we design and learn, our role evolves from creating interfaces to defining the signals that shape intelligent experiences.</strong></h4><blockquote>A quick note before we dive in. This essay continues the thinking I introduced in <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/from-design-to-direction-bridging-product-design-and-ai-thinking-1d372707472d""><em>From design to direction: bridging product design and AI thinking</em></a>. While it is not required reading, it might give helpful context as I build on some of the ideas from that earlier exploration. Do not worry, I will be here when you return.</blockquote><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a signal plus a robot element representing AI will lead towards more targeted generative experiences."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*RMLNlIo1dX8HPoHTnndtPQ.png"" /><figcaption>Illustration for how signals will be key in a more generative experiential future.</figcaption></figure><p>In my first thought piece, I discussed how AI concepts overlap with the work of product designers as we optimize across three key levels: the interfaces we aim to make frictionless, the journeys that help users find value, and the connection to the business outcomes we hope to achieve.</p><p>That work is becoming even more important today. As AI-driven and generative tools move into our day-to-day workflows, the experiences we design no longer stop at the interface. Interfaces can now generate, adapt, and learn from what users do next. The quality of those learning loops depends on the quality of the signals we build into them.</p><p>As we move from static interfaces to generative ones, understanding the signals produced by our experiences and how those signals tie back to a user’s intent becomes foundational. These signals help generative systems reduce model loss, meet expectations, and continue doing what we care about most: helping people make progress in ways they find meaningful.</p><p>In this essay, I will share an approach for connecting instrumentation efforts to high-level business goals and how that prepares us to map signals to intent in ways that shape iterative optimization loops for generative experiences.</p><h3>Understanding what to measure: defining meaning before data</h3><p>There is a lot of writing out there about instrumentation and telemetry, so I will only touch on the basics here. Many of us have heard terms like attrition, cart abandonment, or error rate. We usually hear them through conversations with product managers who reference these numbers as indicators of progress or where improvements are sought after. But I would ask you if you truly know terms like these mean when thinking about the bigger picture?</p><p>Let’s start simple and work out from there by settling on two things. First, let’s define t<a href=""https://www.intercom.com/blog/finding-the-metrics-that-matter-for-your-product/"">elemetry as the raw data we collect.</a> Instrumentation, on the other hand, is the act of deciding which of those data points matter.</p><figure><img alt=""Image illustrating websites with numerous signals causing confusion for AI."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*_UH2OjwJE7okOjG565EFBQ.png"" /><figcaption>Imagine signals as a bunch of news stations all going at once at the same time with the same volume. Just like how we would be unable to focus intelligently, the same can be said for AI.</figcaption></figure><p>We could instrument every single action in a product, but without knowing what is <em>truly</em> meaningful, all we have is noise. The same challenge applies to AI systems, believe it or not. A model trained on large amounts of similar data might recognize correlations, but without context or intent, it cannot know where to focus.</p><p>Deciding what matters does two things. It guides our analysis toward insight instead of noise, and it makes our systems more efficient. Over-instrumentation, taught to me by my data and analytics partners at a prior role, increases storage and processing costs and makes it harder for both humans and machines to understand what users are trying to do.</p><p>By deciding what to focus on before we collect data, we can curate meaningful signals. These signals connect behavior to intent and intent to organizational outcomes. That is the foundation of this framework: shaping experience data so it becomes direction for both product teams and intelligent systems. Bare with me and let’s talk business.</p><h3>Defining what matters</h3><figure><img alt=""Illustration depicting certain telemetry signals being selected for instrumentation efforts to educate our teams and AI tools."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*xlEncsYKVieJ1yf2Zia9_A.png"" /><figcaption>When we contextualize signals around what is meaningful, both our teams and AI can start to make sense of all the noise.</figcaption></figure><p>When we design digital experiences, countless events occur on the front end and back end. Some happen autonomously, some because of user actions. Each is a potential signal, but we need a structured way to interpret them. One useful lens is <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/personas-jobs-be-done/""><em>Jobs to Be Done</em></a> (JTBD).</p><figure><img alt=""Framework illustration listing, from top down, company goal, organizational goal(s), Measurement objectives/OKRs, KPIs, and Signals to show how these support one another."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*aDjnFLyYqaFkBQOawVNIIw.png"" /><figcaption>Each row, from the bottom, should ladder up and support the goals above them to create a stable structure connecting in product signals up to company goals.</figcaption></figure><p>To start, most companies, no matter their size, are fundamentally trying to create value and generate revenue. If we acknowledge that end goal, we can place it at the top of our framework. You may already be familiar with terms like <a href=""https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/pricing-strategies-and-sales-proposals/get-to-know-your-revenue-model""><em>Average Contract Value</em> (ACV) or <em>Average Order Value</em> (AOV)</a>. These are common ways organizations measure growth and understand how customers perceive the value they offer.</p><figure><img alt=""Image illustrating overall framework with AOV filled in at top for company goal conveying all subsequent elements support this high-level goal."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*L59_F2lwhp5oHu-wNIHPhQ.png"" /><figcaption>We always need to identify the reason we do what we do, and typically it involves money.</figcaption></figure><p>Within companies, different groups support the business in different ways. For example, a large online store might have a website team focused on the digital shopping experience and a customer support team helping customers resolve issues. If increasing AOV is a company priority, the website team may set a goal like:</p><blockquote><strong>Improve cross-sell or upsell effectiveness.</strong></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Illustration of framework with example organizational goal."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*Adbi0dEL7_2z-nH_oUf97Q.png"" /><figcaption>Various internal organizations will have their own goals typically created at executive levels.</figcaption></figure><p>From there, we next have the <em>Measurement Objective</em>. This is where we identify the type of behavior we want to influence to support the organizational goal. It is common for multiple measurement objectives to exist for the same goal, especially in larger companies.</p><p>In our online store example, one measurement objective might be encouraging users to add additional items before checking out. To make this meaningful, we can express it as an OKR. Atlassian has a helpful overview of<a href=""https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/okr""> how OKRs function</a> in cross-functional teams if the concept is new.</p><p>A possible OKR might be:</p><blockquote><strong>Increase average items per cart from 1.6 to 1.9.</strong></blockquote><p>This is still fairly high-level, usually tied to a quarter or fiscal year, but it moves us closer to meaningful, measurable work.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of framework with example measurement objective added."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*fW7-KK5eZrBE0Y1H_WikAQ.png"" /><figcaption>Remember OKRs are not KPIs and sit at a higher level.</figcaption></figure><p>Below this sits the <em>Key Performance Indicator </em>(KPI) layer. KPIs are the specific metrics we can directly influence through design and iteration. They give us the levers we can adjust and monitor as we learn. If KPIs feel a little abstract, Asana has a <a href=""https://asana.com/resources/key-performance-indicator-kpi"">great explanation</a> of how teams use them as measurable signals of progress.</p><p>A related KPI might be:</p><blockquote><strong>Increase add-to-cart rate for recommended items by fifteen percent this quarter.</strong></blockquote><p>This gives teams something concrete to experiment with, design for, and measure.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of framework with example KPI filled in."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*muzWF_MjqtyjYKFjUOB4-w.png"" /><figcaption>KPIs can rotate quarterly (common) and still leave room for teams to ideate on how to meet that particular goal.</figcaption></figure><p>With all of this in place, we now have a path from:</p><blockquote><strong>AOV → organizational goal → measurement objective → OKR → KPI</strong></blockquote><p>Now we can move closer to the design layer: understanding user intent and determining the right signals to collect.</p><h3>Connecting signals to intent</h3><figure><img alt=""Illustration with signal section of framework filled in, directing audience to review table of examples below."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*ER93jIm8Wc3a22hlA9sWfg.png"" /><figcaption>As alluded to, there is no one end-all signal. It will take a critical look and collaboration across product and data and analytics teams to capture the right signals for your org.</figcaption></figure><p>Let’s assume our KPI example from before aligns with a JTBD that looks like this:</p><blockquote><strong>When I am shopping for something I need, I want to easily discover related or complementary items so my order feels complete.</strong></blockquote><p>To understand whether users are making progress toward that job, we need to collect telemetry data from key activities. Not every event will matter, but the right ones reveal intent.</p><figure><img alt=""Table of sample signal categories which related to overarching shopper Job detailing how they potential signal various intents AI could pick up on."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*v1HviC_KmaYp-a9xFEhkYQ.png"" /><figcaption>Examples of signals related to the core Job and their connection to identifying a shopper’s intent.</figcaption></figure><p>Signals help us see not only what users are doing but whether they are moving in the direction that represents meaningful progress. Positive signals show alignment. Negative signals reveal friction or mismatched intent.</p><p>This creates a full path from business outcomes down to the behaviors that reflect real value.</p><h3>How the framework extends into generative AI</h3><p>Everything up to this point applies to traditional products where designers create fixed interfaces. Generative experiences change the structure of the work. Instead of designing every step, we are designing the conditions a system uses to decide what to show, what to emphasize, and how to adapt.</p><p>Generative systems do not follow pre-built screens. They follow patterns, predictions, and signals.</p><p>In generative experiences, intent can surface explicitly through a question, a prompt, or a choice, or implicitly through behavior. <a href=""https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/"">Google’s PAIR guidebook</a> talks about this distinction between explicit intent and intent inferred from behavior, which forms the basis for how AI predicts what comes next.</p><p>Once the system infers intent, it predicts what the user needs next. That prediction determines what gets generated, whether that is a layout, a set of recommendations, content variations, or the next step in a flow. Even so, we still need a way to understand whether the prediction was correct. <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/guidelines-for-human-ai-interaction/"">Microsoft’s Human-AI Interaction Guidelines </a>reinforce this by encouraging systems to make their reasoning visible and understandable, so people can verify whether predictions make sense.</p><p>This is where the framework becomes essential. Organizational goals, OKRs, KPIs, and JTBDs give us a standard for what “good” looks like. They describe the journey and the progress that represent value for users. The signals we instrument become evidence of whether the generated experience actually supported that progress.</p><p>Even when a generative system produces something entirely new, we can still evaluate it. We are not comparing the UI to a previous layout. We are comparing behavior to expected signals. If users are moving forward, the inference was correct. If users hesitate, ignore content, or abandon, the system has made the wrong assumption. <a href=""https://openai.com/index/learning-to-summarize-with-human-feedback/"">OpenAI describes a similar idea</a> in their work on learning from human feedback, where systems compare predicted outcomes to desired ones.</p><p>This gives designers two places to focus optimization efforts. We can refine the experience that was generated, or we can refine how the system infers intent. Sometimes this means improving interface patterns. Sometimes it means strengthening the signals we collect. Sometimes it means giving users clearer ways to express what they want.</p><p>Either way, the work becomes the same. We check the signals produced by a generative interface against the expected signals tied to a JTBD, and we use that comparison to guide how the system adapts.</p><p>This is how designers contribute to AI-driven experiences. We are not only designing what users see. We are designing the understanding the system relies on to generate it.</p><h3>Where we go from here</h3><p>All of this sets up the next step. Generative systems cannot rely on signals alone. They also need to understand our components, patterns, and design systems in deeper, more semantic ways. <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/the-future-of-design-systems-is-semantic/"">Figma has written about this shift</a> in their guidance on semantic design systems, emphasizing that AI needs component meaning, not just component visuals, to generate interfaces responsibly.</p><p>In the next article, I will explore how semantic design systems help shape what generative systems create, and how that connects to the broader ideas of encoding, pattern representation, and meaning within AI models.</p><h3>Further reading</h3><p>If you would like to explore some of the ideas mentioned in this article, here are a few helpful starting points:</p><p><strong>Instrumentation and product measurement</strong><br /> • What is a KPI? — Asana<br /> <a href=""https://asana.com/resources/key-performance-indicator-kpi"">https://asana.com/resources/key-performance-indicator-kpi</a><br /> • How OKRs work — Atlassian<br /> <a href=""https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/okr"">https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/okr</a></p><p><strong>AI, intent, and prediction quality</strong><br /> • People + AI Guidebook — Google PAIR<br /> <a href=""https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/"">https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/</a><br /> • Learning from human feedback — OpenAI<br /> <a href=""https://openai.com/index/learning-to-summarize-with-human-feedback/"">https://openai.com/index/learning-to-summarize-with-human-feedback/</a><br /> • Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction — Microsoft Research<br /> <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/guidelines-for-human-ai-interaction/"">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/guidelines-for-human-ai-interaction/</a></p><p><strong>Design systems and meaning</strong><br /> • The future of design systems is semantic — Figma<br /> <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/the-future-of-design-systems-is-semantic/"">https://www.figma.com/blog/the-future-of-design-systems-is-semantic/</a></p><p>These pieces reflect similar themes around intent, signals, and how intelligent systems learn.

<h4><em>A shift towards token-first and AI-assisted systems</em></h4><p>Figma releases updates at a pace that feels pretty overwhelming. A new feature drops, you learn about the feature, then integrate it into your workflow. But soon after, more features are released and your workflow feels outdated again…like it’s an endless enhancement cycle.</p><p>For many designers, especially ones who manage large Design Systems, it’s hard to find time (and energy) to understand which features actually matter and how each Figma update affects your day-to-day work.</p><figure><img alt=""Figma features shown with component slots, Figma MCP, and extended collections"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HRFlQZdzrw0vNPHuxFgVIQ.png"" /></figure><p>But <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/schema-2025-design-systems-recap/"">Figma’s last few rounds of updates</a> focus on a token-first, structured, and AI-assisted workflow. Instead of circling around convenience features or quality of life updates, Figma is reshaping how Design System teams think about variables, code alignment, and how AI can expedite the process.</p><p>So which features should you focus on and what does each update actually mean for Design Systems? Let’s break down 3 critical updates recently rolled out with variables, component slots, and Figma MCP.</p><h3>Variables</h3><p>Variables have been at the forefront in supporting token-first systems. Figma recognized the common use case of multi-brand Design Systems, and its latest updates makes variables even more scalable. Let’s look at the new extended collections, new mode limits, and exporting variables.</p><h4>Extended collections</h4><p>There have been issues with multi-brand systems not meeting their adopter needs due to the limitations of Figma variables. Product teams would create hacks by copying variable collections into their own files, recreating themes, or even rebuilding token structures from scratch… meaning system updates and governance became broken across adopters.</p><p><strong>But with extended collections, Design System teams can support multiple brands/ products that require their own custom theme, while keeping variables in sync with the core system.</strong></p><p><strong>How extended collections work:</strong></p><ul><li>A Design System team publishes a core (parent) variable collection</li><li>Designers across the company can extend the core collection with their own brand-specific themes (overriding only the values they need)</li><li>The extended collections stay linked to the parent collection (and will inherit updates like new variables or token updates)</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Example of the extended collection’s modal for Figma variables"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DYlDw55gSnH-5KKWtZ_ymg.png"" /><figcaption>Extended collections allow multi-level branching</figcaption></figure><p><strong>But there are still limits of extended collections:</strong></p><ul><li>You cannot edit the variable’s alias name, scope, or mode in extended collections</li><li>Extended collections still require strong naming conventions and structure</li><li>Product designers may struggle to understand which token is pulling from where unless documentation is clear</li><li>They require more governance and a review process must be established for Design System members to ensure correct usage</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: Extended collections are only available for full seat users on Enterprise plans. I know many Organization plans also need this feature, so it’s disappointing it’s only available to premium accounts (please don’t shoot the messenger).</em></blockquote><h4>Increase in mode limits per plan</h4><p>Many Figma users have been personally victimized by how many modes were given to Professional and Organization plans. For instance, if a Design System supports 5 breakpoints (between X-Small and X-Large), they would not have been able to use variables to represent proper responsiveness. So the increase in how many modes you can use within each variable collection is better suited for team needs.</p><ul><li><strong>Professional:</strong> 10 modes per collection (up from 4)</li><li><strong>Organization:</strong> 20 modes per collection (up from 4)</li><li><strong>Enterprise:</strong> Unlimited modes with extended collections (up from 40)</li><li><strong>Starter:</strong> Not eligible (variables aren’t included in this plan)</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Figma variables showing many modes for a collection named “Breakpoints”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6n7IZQAtbtFR3ENo9SLh9g.png"" /><figcaption>Figma increased the amount of modes given to each plan type</figcaption></figure><p><strong>By increasing the capacity for modes, Figma is encouraging teams to move more variation into variables rather than building larger, heavier component libraries</strong>. Instead of teams finding “hacks” around the mode limitations, Design Systems can now have fewer overrides and duplicated components.</p><h4>Import and export as JSON</h4><p>Figma must have noticed many plugins were created to allow designers to import and export variables, like the <a href=""https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1256972111705530093/export-import-variables"">Export/Import Variables plugin</a>, because now they’ve introduced a built-in feature to serve this purpose.</p><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: Some accounts that should have this feature may still not have access (I still do not as of December 2025.)</em></blockquote><p><strong>Though it seems like a less significant update, it has huge implications for the maturity and governance of Design Systems</strong>. This helps teams adopt a “source of truth” mentality due to tokens from the design tools syncing with version-controlled repositories.</p><figure><img alt=""Demo of the import and export variables feature in Figma"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*X2y0XiNElF6zMr5bxZEziw.png"" /><figcaption><em>Image of import/ export variables feature from </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFjIaN_wlWg&amp;t=1313s""><em>Figma Schema</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Not only that, importing and exporting directly from Figma supports easier migration with fewer mistakes, automated updates of tokens, and a possible future of continuous integration between design and code.</p><h3>Component slots</h3><p>Figma components are powerful, but can also be rigid. If a designer needs to customize a component instance, they often have to find workarounds like detaching the component… a big “no-no” to Design System teams.</p><p><strong>But slots offer greater component flexibility without detaching. Basically, slots are placeholder containers inside components that let designers edit and customize content within an instance.</strong> And instead of relying on the Design System team to create product-specific components and increase library complexity, designers can insert the layer themselves.</p><p>Slots also allow Design Systems to specify which components are allowed inside a slot. So while designers have flexibility, they’re still working within system-approved patterns.</p><figure><img alt=""Demo of the component slots feature in Figma"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4wMiSfcsEahJHZmROX2NTQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Image of component slots’ demo from </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFjIaN_wlWg&amp;t=1313s""><em>Figma Schema</em></a></figcaption></figure><h4>Benefits and limits of slots</h4><p><strong>Some more “pros” of slots used in Design Systems are:</strong></p><ul><li>Slots mirror how components work in frontend frameworks so they align closer with code implementation</li><li>Components are simplified and clean by avoiding common flexibility workarounds</li><li>Complex components like cards and modals become easier to adapt across product teams due to slots’ scalability</li><li>System compliance improves due to slots’ design freedom within guardrails</li></ul><p><strong>Now let’s talk about the “cons” of slots:</strong></p><ul><li>Slots instances require careful planning to avoid overly complex or vague component designs</li><li>Slots are not ideal for strict system patterns, like notification and messaging usage</li><li>System adopters have a learning curve to understand how to use slots without breaking away from the Design System</li><li>Slots increase Design System maintenance because slots instances must be defined, documentation must be written, and code must be aligned</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: Slots are only available by early access sign-up for paid plans (no starter plan). </em><a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeaZNBEWTahxSYh4FDpUNzQlwM3HKw_Eg0U-hwgXETCtAxm8A/viewform""><em>You can apply for access through Figma’s Google form</em></a><em>, but your plan’s admin must complete the form on your team’s behalf.</em></blockquote><h3>Figma MCP (model context protocol) server</h3><p>Figma’s MCP allows AI tools, like Claude or Cursor, to access information from your Figma files.

<h4>An exploration of causes, costs and competitive advantages connected to design maturity in product organisations</h4><figure><img alt=""A dark-themed slide titled “Design Maturity: Moving beyond usability to strategic advantage.” Below the title are three neon-style icons: a document labelled “FAQ” in orange, a central flowchart with the word “GOAL” in blue, and an “Opportunity Service Map” diagram in orange showing connected nodes."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HcVcbXVTWcub1SJiaQPbNA.png"" /></figure><p>High‑performing product organisations depend on maturity across all disciplines — design, product management, engineering, data, editorial, architecture. When one discipline is not being fully utilised, the whole organisation suffers, because maturity is systemic. But design maturity is sometimes misunderstood as a craft issue. Sometimes design is equated with usability. But true design maturity expands an organisation’s capacity to work well in uncertainty. So if you want to create the future, rather than just predict it, you need to find ways to achieve design maturity.</p><h3>Design maturity is more than usability</h3><p>I’m a design leader, so this matters to me personally. But a lack of understanding and investment in design maturity matters to everyone in a product organisation. When one function is underutilised, the entire system suffers. IDEO defines design as “sensemaking + imagination”. It’s the reason design is such a valuable partner to product management — <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/the-value-of-design-in-a-product-organisation-850661d1b22f"">design extends sense-making into difference-making</a>. Product management excels at sense-making. It synthesises data and combines analytical skills with empathy to make decisions and provide direction — ultimately holding accountability for the success of the product. But without design maturity, an organisation can lose out on the creativity and divergent thinking strengths of design. This comes with costs. <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20design/our%20insights/the%20business%20value%20of%20design/mckinsey-bvod-art-digital-rgb.pdf"">McKinsey’s <em>Business Value of Design</em> (2018)</a> found that design maturity correlates directly with financial and product performance.</p><p>But many organisations unconsciously define design too narrowly. The dominance of UX has led many non-designers to conflate and confuse the value of design with interaction design, usability and surface-level detail. Even <a href=""https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/"">Cagan’s model, for example, places design chiefly in the usability domain</a>. This framing is not wrong for managing delivery risk. But it reduces the perceived scope of design’s contribution. We’ve seen this in the past, when <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/"">Jakob Nielsen’s early usability heuristics</a> became the <em>default</em> definition of design work in low-maturity organisations.</p><p>But thinking of design as solely delivering “usability” within this context is limiting. “Usability” is necessary but not sufficient for an organisation to make the most of design. The result is a reduced role focused on UI, interaction flows, accessibility compliance and removing usability risks. This is all important, but it’s table stakes. When design gets trapped here, the organisation is often limited to incremental change. Organisations that use design only as a mechanism for managing usability risks do deliver safe, predictable, incremental improvements. But they might miss category-shifting ideas. They may also find themselves falling back to stakeholders for direction-setting or executing a <a href=""https://psychsafety.com/the-hippo/"">HIPPO’s vision</a>, because they’re underpowered in the skills needed to generate, communicate and manage diverse insights and ideas effectively. They’re likely to be limited to communicating vision in logic-biased prose rather than category shifting poetry that design-enabled product management is capable of.</p><h3>Climbing the ladder…</h3><p>When a product organisation is immature, design is equated with wireframes, flows, accessibility checks or research to eliminate risk. This work is necessary but insufficient for value creation. <a href=""https://ddc.dk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Design-Delivers-How-design-accelerates-your-business.pdf"">The Danish Design Ladder</a> describes how organisations evolve through:</p><ol><li><strong>Non-design</strong> — Design is absent or decorative.</li><li><strong>Design as styling</strong> — Form-giving, surface-level.</li><li><strong>Design as process</strong> — It’s an integrated element of development.</li><li><strong>Design as strategy</strong> — It’s a tool for shaping business models and futures.</li></ol><p>Most product‑influencer narratives peak at level 3 at best. But mature design can go further: into strategy, systems, and the shaping of opportunity itself.</p><p>The Danish Ladder says design will have the biggest impact when it’s deeply embedded in the strategic planning of an organisation. This is because design is a process of translation. Through artefacts, design translates ideas into value-generating products and services. As design undertakes this “translation” it also inevitably transforms ideas, manipulating constraints and capabilities to optimise the design. Design is therefore most effective when it’s able to influence both problem-framing and solutioning at the strategy level. Design isn’t art. It’s a process for solving real problems for real people by understanding them and getting creative to make progress and a positive difference.</p><p>When design is only allowed to operate at surface levels, or even when it’s called on to “execute” a strategy, you’re missing out on potential value. To non-designers this point might feel like “discipline inflation.” I get it, we all want to feel important. We all want a seat at the table. We all want to argue that we’re the secret to competitive advantage and need to “hold the pen” on the strategy. I don’t think that’s true for design in every context. The sense-making, convergent tendencies of product management mean that in most cases design shouldn’t be the dominant decision-maker in a product organisation. But they should be included in strategic work — and work that is most ambiguous — for the simple reason that designers are brilliant at having and managing ideas.</p><h3><strong>Idea management: The missing discipline?</strong></h3><p>Design is a systematic, creative, opportunity-generating discipline. When organisations misunderstand it as only enabling usability risk-management, they prevent themselves from operating at higher maturity. Organising around risk (value, usability, feasibility, viability) is sensible. But risk management isn’t the whole job. If you only reduce risk, you only reduce possibility.</p><p>Designers are trained to expand possibility and enable delivery by moving fluidly between divergence and convergence. A mature design practice surfaces new possibilities from research, signals, or anomalies. It looks across journeys, systems, and time — not just features. It detects patterns that suggest new value. It turns weak signals into opportunity areas. All of these core competencies of a skilled product designer are powerful and valuable — but so far, they’re not particularly unique to design. In some cases, they may even be more naturally suited to the convergent mindset of a product manager. But design does bring something extra. Design is a structured discipline for managing ideas. It doesn’t just detect patterns — it invents new ones. And it turns weak signals not just into opportunity areas, but into articulated opportunities that other disciplines can experience and understand quickly and cheaply to collaborate. Design done well looks like:</p><ul><li>Divergence (exploring many possibilities)</li><li>Convergence (narrowing to the strongest)</li><li>Visualisation (making intangible futures and assumptions visible and testable)</li><li>Iteration (enriching ideas through critique)</li><li>Integration (seeing relationships as systems and experiences emerge)</li></ul><p>Let’s look at the impact that this can have in practice…</p><h4><strong>Three hypothetical approaches</strong></h4><p>Imagine three different approaches to the same project. The context is high in ambiguity. The market context is highly competitive. To operate effectively the organisation needs to combine multiple talents, each with their own levels of maturity and different cultures. Likewise, the technical landscape is complex with a mixture of technical debt and emerging technologies that few in the team have experience of using. We step into the multiverse and see how three teams might approach the task:</p><p>Team A starts their discovery and execution by a PM creating a strong, detailed PRFAQ. It places users right at the centre of a story of the future. This sharpens the narrative across disciplines. It’s an inspiring picture that teams can get behind, so it<strong> a</strong>ligns stakeholders around a single vision. The FAQ section answers the questions that are front of mind. But the document imagines an end‑state rather than discovers one. It privileges linear, verbal thinkers who love prose. It’s like a piece of rhetoric, so it also risks a false certainty.</p><p>Team B create a detailed and comprehensive Opportunity Solution Tree (OST). It allows them to multi-track, exploring data and customer conversations to build an abstract map of opportunities. The team attaches data to branches to help prioritise the biggest opportunities and they work along branches, logically validating opportunities and bringing design skills in to generate possibilities. The team works on it together, collaboratively, sharing perspectives and having rich conversations amongst themselves and with users. It encourages exploration before convergence. And it helps the team track evidence and hypotheses together. But it’s weak at representing lived experience or systemic relationships — it’s an abstraction of a problem space. Sometimes the team struggles to navigate the structure of the ever-expanding tree. And it’s hard to hold the whole structure in your head at once. It makes systems thinking, journey‑based context, understanding time and flow harder, because it’s natively hierarchical rather than relational.</p><p>Team BBC is led by a skilled leader, experienced in multidisciplinary collaboration including design. They like the multi-tracking divergence and evidence-based decision-making of the OST, but they think that can make it even stronger. They create an Opportunity Service Map. It’s a shared artefact that still operates at an abstract level but brings the product landscape to life — it helps the team visualise experiences before, during and after customers interact with the product. It helps teams understand the experience and the backstage systems that power it. They talk to users, feeding in insight and operating with empathy. The team works collaboratively, as they do with the OST, but now they overlay opportunities directly onto a service blueprint. They’re curious, so they sidestep the “<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/teresatorres_continuousdiscoveryhabits-curseofknowledge-activity-7203470831937613825-vXO8/"">curse of knowledge</a>.” They start with problems and “why” questions, then they move to lo-fi ideation. They work collaboratively using techniques like <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/learn-how-to-use-the-best-ideation-methods-scamper?srsltid=AfmBOoqX9Jcf5a_86yRXxXxYHI2rBgB0r09EfY6vqnIzHcjoUEV84eb0"">SCAMPER</a> to explore and refine ideas. Then they prototype — they select the method depending on the concept and what assumptions they need to investigate. They regularly create cheap sacrificial concepts and test with users. Because the Opportunity Service Map shows frontstage, backstage, enablers, time, friction, confidence and impact it connects ideas and assumptions to the reality they operate in. This keeps exploration broad yet situated.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LzNFN2DEfGWpjG6c3stA2w.png"" /><figcaption>Limiting the impact of design to usability and execution is risky business. Divergence and convergence and a cocktail of multidisciplinary collaboration will usually lead to better results. But the top performing teams understand where and how design can add most value.</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Immaturity in one discipline hurts the whole system</strong></h3><p>The best teams I’ve ever worked in operate more like Team BBC. Teams A and B exhibit many strengths of an effective product team. But Team A’s design immaturity forces them to execute a vision that is handed to them. When a team uses a PRFAQ to translate customer obsession and insight into action, it’s a brilliant way to ensure decisions in delivery align with a coherent user outcome. But teams first need to be able to generate this insight and have invented a vision of how to meet it. A PRFAQ is evidence of the synthesising power of product management. It can boost accountability and provide a single-threaded leader with a contract to fulfil. But it won’t help you create.</p><p>Product management isn’t about managing a static thing — we’re managing not only what the product is and how it’s performing now, we’re often managing what it can and should become in the future. Product teams are responsible for delivery and discovery. Design maturity is so powerful because it introduces comfort and competence in dealing with the ambiguity of invention.</p><p>OSTs are therefore a signal of increased design maturity because they help encourage teams to work “outwards as well as backwards” — diverging and multitracking. This looks more like design — moving forwards <em>and</em> backwards, diverging and converging across multiple tracks, iterating to refine and optimise. Once you add in creating artefacts that act as experiments as you make progress, you see how and where design adds value.</p><p>Design helps teams explore from the present into multiple plausible futures before committing to one. An organisation without maturity in design might only ever develop the competence to work backwards from a chosen future or execute with an inherited or fixed set of constraints. With design maturity an organisation is much more likely to be able to blend the talents of product management and engineering with design to work forwards and backwards, manipulating problem-framing and solution-making to help the organisation find the most valuable future, no matter their context.</p><figure><img alt=""A side-by-side graphic comparing the Stacey Matrix and the Cynefin Framework. The left panel shows the Stacey Matrix with four zones — Simple, Complicated, Complex and Chaotic — arranged along axes of agreement and certainty. The right panel shows the Cynefin Framework with its five domains — Clear, Complicated, Complex, Chaotic, and Confused — displayed as a cross-shaped diagram with brief guidance on how to act in each domain."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ydkg8peuMaITWGYW_0e2Fw.png"" /><figcaption>Both the Stacey Matrix and Cynefin describe the different contexts a product organisation is likely to operate in — and they suggest how process might need to flex to increase the chance of team success.</figcaption></figure><p>Modern organisations operate across multiple contexts. Mature product teams know that some work is simple or complicated and work through it accordingly. The most mature teams can also identify and operate in complexity and chaos. To work well in complex domains you need strong, confident disciplines, distributed decision-making and a willingness to explore unknowns.</p><p>When design maturity is low, the whole organisation becomes less capable of operating in uncertainty. Product management might end up filling the gap — but you’re likely to have fewer, weaker ideas. Not because product managers and other disciplines can’t have ideas, but because design as a discipline has evolved to manage them most effectively. Each discipline has a core strength and purpose. This is why you need design — because it adds unique and valuable skills and because immaturity in one part becomes immaturity everywhere, as everyone is forced to generalise to fill the gap.</p><p>We can look at two helpful models to understand this further. Robert Kegan’s theory of adult development describes how people evolve in their “mental complexity” — their ability to reconcile ambiguity and competing truths. At the Socialised Mind, identity and direction are shaped by the expectations of others. Decisions are anchored in fitting in, meeting external standards and aligning with prevailing norms.</p><p>At the Self-Authoring Mind, individuals develop an internal compass. They can understand and appreciate the expectations of others while also generating their own frameworks for judgement and action.</p><p>A smaller group shift further into the Self-Transforming Mind, where they can integrate multiple frames at once and work flexibly in paradox, ambiguity and change. Kegan talks about individuals. But I think you can use these stages to describe teams.</p><figure><img alt=""A diagram showing Robert Kegan’s three stages of adult development — Socialised Mind, Self-Authoring Mind, and Self-Transforming Mind — mapped along a horizontal timeline. Each stage includes traits such as reliance on external expectations, developing an internal compass, and integrating multiple perspectives. The diagram also includes brief labels describing how leaders operate at each stage. Kegan talks about these levels in the context of personal development in his book An Everyone Culture."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kUuz2i-GCGtp-gfyfEXscg.png"" /></figure><p>A multidisciplinary team mirrors these stages. A Socialised-level team performs competently within the dominant discipline’s worldview (often PM or engineering). They optimise for alignment and predictability — they “organise to execute”. A Self-Authoring team begins to define its own integrated way of working across disciplines by co-creating a shared approach grounded in collective purpose and context — they’re empowered to solve problems. A Self-Transforming team goes further: it can switch modes depending on the problem space — convergent when needed, divergent when needed, exploratory in uncertainty, decisive in clarity — they’re <strong>empowered to find problems</strong> and invent the future.</p><p>Operating in ambiguity demands high maturity across disciplines. The lowest common denominator of people playing multiple roles or the over-dominance of a single discipline won’t work. Strength and maturity in each discipline is required, so that the organisation and its teams aren’t trapped by any one discipline’s identity but can metabolise all of them to meet the moment. When teams mature to this point, they stop behaving as a collection of functions and start operating as an adaptive system capable of solving harder, more ambiguous problems than any discipline could manage alone.</p><p>Kegan’s developmental lens pairs naturally with Amy Edmondson’s work on psychological safety and teaming. Edmondson argues that in environments of high uncertainty and high interdependence teams perform best when members can speak up, question assumptions, surface risks, and integrate diverse perspectives without fear. That’s only possible when individuals move beyond the Socialised Mindset and when the team behaves at a Self-Authoring or even Self-Transforming level — able to adapt how it works together.</p><h4>Building maturity</h4><p>When design is strong, every discipline benefits. In simple or complicated contexts, disciplines can operate independently and with lower levels of maturity. Product management can set a goal, engineering can implement with rigour, design can ensure usability. But as complexity increases, the future stops being something you predict and starts being something that emerges from interaction. At a certain point, predicting becomes riskier than designing. No discipline has the full picture. You need the exploration, translation and reframing muscles that design brings — finding gaps and opportunities, making ideas tangible, and helping the team update its understanding of the problem, the constraints and what’s possible. At its best, design surfaces opportunities before they calcify into problems, synthesises research into multi-level insights, prototypes to explore strategy (not just UI), and connects journeys, systems and stories into experiences that actually matter. It helps shape direction alongside PM, engineering, editorial, data and architecture — but only when it’s included early enough, high enough and meaningfully enough.</p><p>Maturity rarely develops evenly across an organisation. But you can accelerate the maturity of design by involving and empowering designers where ambiguity, opportunity and risk are highest. These are the areas where linear planning breaks down, expertise alone stops being enough, and teams need experimentation, creativity and distributed judgement.</p><p>Simple shifts can bring greater design maturity to an organisation:</p><ul><li>investing in framing as well as solving</li><li>intentionally cycling through divergence and convergence</li><li>mapping opportunities into the systems they live within</li><li>critiquing ideas to sharpen, not to narrow — and to build rather than diminish creative confidence</li><li>pairing narrative tools (PRFAQ) with experiential ones (prototypes) and making richer abstractions of opportunity spaces — finding ways to show, not just tell people what the future should be like.</li></ul><p>Importantly, these shifts don’t weaken other disciplines — they strengthen them. They help PM and engineering build design literacy without forcing those teams to compensate for an underpowered design function.</p><p>Design maturity isn’t about risk reduction; it’s about strategic advantage. It helps organisations spot new value early and gives teams the confidence to pursue it. If you expect your organisation to shape the future, not just survive it, your teams need the maturity to discover, deliver <strong><em>and</em></strong> design what comes next. The future we prefer won’t arrive ready-made — it will be built by the organisations that design it.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9f45fd4e20c3"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/why-you-need-design-maturity-in-a-product-organisation-and-how-to-get-it-9f45fd4e20c3"">Why you need design maturity in a product organisation, and how to get it</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

You might still be processing all the mental breakthroughs, communication revelations, and identity shifts last week’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-super-cold-moon-in-gemini-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Gemini Full Moon</a> brought up. As we enter this week, the energy shifts dramatically. Starting Monday, the moon enters Leo, and suddenly we’re revved up and ready to go. This fiery lunar transit wants us confident, creative, and taking action on everything we just learned about ourselves. The Leo energy is basically the universe saying “okay, you had your revelations, now let’s DO something  about them,” which feels empowering after days of emotional and mental processing. </p>



<p>Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th at 7:23 A.M. EST, marking the final time this planet will be retrograde in Pisces in our lifetime. If everything’s felt foggy, confusing, or like you’re living in a rom-com where you can’t tell fantasy from reality for the past five months, Neptune retrograde is why. The planet of dreams and collective  consciousness has been reviewing lessons since July, forcing us to distinguish between what’s real and what’s wishful thinking in our lives. When Neptune shifts direct, that fog starts lifting.  </p>



<p>On a collective level, this final Neptune in Pisces chapter (since 2011!) means we’re  wrapping up a 14-year cycle of learning to balance spirituality with reality, creativity with practicality, and compassion with boundaries. We might finally stop being so easily brainwashed by media narratives, romanticizing red flags, or escaping into fantasy when reality gets hard. Stay hydrated this week (Neptune rules water and our bodies will feel the shift), get grounded through movement or time in nature, and  journal your dreams. The subconscious is downloading final wisdom before this cosmic chapter closes. </p>



<p>Adding to the forward momentum, Mercury enters Sagittarius on December 11th, joining the sun, Venus, and Mars already in this Fire sign for one powerful final week of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Sagittarius Season energy</a>. After Mercury’s long stay in Scorpio (thanks to the retrograde), this shift into Sag has our minds craving adventure over analysis. With four major planets in Sagittarius, this is the most positive, forward-moving energy we’ve felt in months, perfect for manifesting, saying yes to invitations, spending time outdoors, and having more fun.  </p>



<p>But here’s the shadow: with all this Sag fire, we can easily spread ourselves too thin, overcommit because everything sounds exciting, or lose focus jumping between seventeen different opportunities. Take advantage of the action-oriented vibes without burning yourself out trying to do absolutely everything at once. Be bold, be honest, be adventurous, but also be intentional about where you’re directing all that energy.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ </p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, your inner world is about to get a whole lot clearer, but first, are you ready for what’s coming? Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th in your spirituality and closure sector, and honestly, the fog in your subconscious is finally starting to lift after five months of retrograde confusion. This marks the last time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, which is significant because your inner world,  dreams, and spiritual practice have been under cosmic renovation since 2011. The direct motion brings clarity about which healing practices actually work versus which ones were just spiritual bypassing, and what closure you still need before Neptune enters <em>your </em>sign on January 26th for over a decade. Use these final weeks of Neptune  in Pisces to finish the inner work, release what’s been lurking in your subconscious, and solidify your spiritual foundation because once Neptune hits Aries, your entire identity is going to get the foggy, transformative, confusing-but-magical treatment. </p>



<p>This is also the final full week of Mars (your ruler!) in Sagittarius lighting up your expansion sector, plus Mercury enters Sag on December 11th, making your mind and actions aligned on adventure, learning, and growth. The fire energy is peak levels right now… you’re motivated, optimistic, and probably saying yes to everything that sounds  exciting. But here’s the cosmic tension: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars in Sagittarius</a> is squaring Neptune in  Pisces this week, creating friction between your desire for bold action and your need for spiritual rest. This square might manifest as wanting to book spontaneous trips  while also feeling called to meditate for hours, or pushing forward aggressively while your subconscious is screaming that you need to slow down and process. The lesson? You can be both adventurous and spiritually grounded, but only if you’re intentional about balancing the two. </p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, Neptune shifts direct in Pisces on December 10th and suddenly your  friendships are about to make a lot more sense. For five months, Neptune retrograde  had you questioning which communities were real versus which ones were just  comfortable illusions, and now direct motion brings clarity about who actually deserves  your energy. This is the final time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime,  marking the end of a 14-year cycle of learning to distinguish between genuine  connection and codependent loyalty in your social circles. You might suddenly feel ready to post again, curate your timeline without guilt, mute people who <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=peace+refinery29&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">drain your peace</a>, or simply have peaceful detachment from friendships that no longer align with who you’re becoming. With Uranus also wrapping its final tour in your sign, this double dose of clarity about community is helping you trust your discernment… if someone feels off, they probably are, and you don’t owe anyone access to your evolution just because they knew the old you. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, this is the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius activating your  transformation and shared resources sector, plus Mercury enters Sag on December 11th, making conversations about money, intimacy, and depth way more direct. Things might have felt tumultuous around wealth-building and joint finances, but this Mars energy is pushing you to finally take action on investments, partnerships, or healing work you’ve been contemplating. Mars in Sag is squaring Neptune in Pisces this week,  creating tension between your desire to hustle independently and your need to lean on  community support. This square might show up as wanting to do everything yourself financially while your friends are literally offering help, or being overly generous with your resources because someone’s sob story pulled on your heartstrings. This transit’s about learning when to receive support from your community versus when to set  financial boundaries so you’re not depleting yourself trying to save everyone. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th and your career sector is  finally getting some forward clarity after months of professional fog. Neptune  retrograde had you questioning whether your ambition was authentic or just what you  thought success should look like, and now direct motion helps you see which  professional path actually aligns with your soul versus which one just looks impressive. This is the last time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, completing a 14-year cycle of learning that reputation without authenticity is exhausting. Use these final weeks of Neptune in Pisces to make any last professional adjustments, solidify your authentic career direction, and prepare for Neptune entering Aries in January,  which will shift the collective fog from your career to your community, giving you even more clarity about your public path. </p>



<p>This is also the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius activating your partnership sector, and Mercury joins the party on December 11th, making relationship conversations and collaborative projects move quickly. You’re feeling bold about what you need from partnerships and finally saying it out loud instead of just adapting to what others want. Mars in Sag also squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating friction between your desire for direct, honest partnerships and the confusion still lingering in your career ambitions. This square might manifest as wanting clarity in relationships while your professional life feels foggy, or pushing partners to be decisive when you’re still figuring out your own path. The lesson? You can demand honesty in your connections while also admitting you don’t have everything figured out professionally.  </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, Neptune shifts direct in Pisces on December 10th in your expansion sector and suddenly your beliefs about what’s possible are getting clearer. For five months, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/neptune-retrograde-in-aries-pisces-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Neptune retrograde had you</a> questioning your entire worldview, spiritual practices, and whether your optimism was genuine or just denial, and now forward motion helps you see which philosophies actually serve your growth. This is the final time Neptune will  be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, wrapping up 14 years of learning the difference between faith that empowers and fantasy that enables. You might feel ready to commit to spiritual practices that work, book travel that’s been calling you, or simply trust your intuition about what expansion looks like now. Use this time to embody the wisdom you’ve gained instead of just philosophizing about it. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, this is the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius lighting up your wellness and daily routine sector, plus Mercury enters Sag on December 11th, making your mind and body aligned on creating sustainable habits. You’re motivated to optimize your health, work routines, and self-care practices with enthusiasm instead of just grinding through  obligation. Mars in Sag also squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating tension between your desire for structured routines and your need for philosophical  exploration. This square might show up as wanting to meal prep and stay disciplined while also feeling called to spontaneously book a spiritual retreat, or pushing yourself  hard physically while your beliefs are saying rest is sacred too. Remember that  wellness and expansion aren’t enemies… you can have daily discipline and spiritual freedom simultaneously. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th in your transformation and  intimacy sector, and the fog around your shadow work is finally clearing. Neptune  retrograde had you processing depth, shared resources, and vulnerability in ways that felt confusing… were you healing or just talking about healing? Now direct motion brings clarity about which transformation has been authentic versus performative. This is the last time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, completing 14 years of learning the difference between real intimacy and curated vulnerability designed for maximum impact. You might suddenly see which financial partnerships are solid, which intimate connections are worth the investment, or where you’ve been using depth as another role to play instead of actual healing. Use these final weeks of  Neptune in Pisces to solidify the transformation that’s been happening beneath your spotlight: the real work, not just the highlight reel. </p>



<p>This is also the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius activating your creativity, romance, and pleasure sector, and Mercury joins on December 11th, making your self-expression bold, unfiltered, and honestly unstoppable. You’re creating from inspiration, loving with passion, and expressing yourself without apologizing — peak Leo energy backed by  cosmic fire. But here’s the tension: Mars in Sag squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating friction between your desire to be seen boldly and the quiet transformation still happening in your depths. This square might manifest as wanting to perform your growth publicly when some of it still needs private processing, or creating art about your shadow work before you’ve fully integrated the lessons. The lesson? You can be both visible and still becoming, but make sure your external expression is backed by  internal authenticity. </p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, Neptune shifts direct in Pisces on December 10th and your partnership sector is getting the clarity you’ve been desperately craving. Neptune retrograde had you  questioning which connections were genuinely reciprocal versus which ones only  worked because you did all the emotional labor, and now forward motion helps you see  the difference clearly. This is the final time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, ending 14 years of learning that not everyone you try to fix actually wants to be saved. You might suddenly have peaceful detachment from relationships that were draining you, see which partnerships are built on authentic alignment, or simply trust your standards without guilt. Use this time to honor connections that actually meet you halfway and release the ones that were always one-sided. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, this is the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius lighting up your home and family sector, plus Mercury enters Sag on December 11th, making domestic conversations and foundation shifts move quickly. You’re ready to take bold action on your living situation, set boundaries with family, or simply make your private life match your public evolution. But here’s where it gets interesting: Mars in Sag squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating tension between your desire to revolutionize your foundation and the relationship clarity still integrating. This square might show up as  wanting to make big home changes while your partnerships are still finding balance, or having family drama triggered by the new standards you’re setting in relationships. The lesson is that changing your foundation and changing your partnerships happen simultaneously — they’re connected.  </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th in your wellness sector and  suddenly your daily routines are making more sense. For five months, Neptune  retrograde had you questioning which self-care practices actually worked versus which  ones just looked spiritual, and now direct motion brings clarity about sustainable  wellness. This is the last time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, completing 14 years of learning that optimization without intuition is just exhausting perfectionism. You might suddenly see which health habits serve your actual body versus which ones you maintain because they’re trendy, or realize that rest is productive even when it doesn’t look like anything. Use these final weeks of Neptune in Pisces to commit to routines that honor both your need for structure and your body’s need for flexibility: wellness that’s sustainable, not just Instagram-worthy. </p>



<p>This is also the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius activating your communication sector, and Mercury joins on December 11th, making your voice bold, direct, and maybe a little too honest if you’re not careful. You’re saying what you mean without diplomatic editing, which is liberating but could also burn bridges if you’re not intentional. Mars in Sag also squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating friction between your desire to speak bluntly and the wellness clarity still integrating. This  square might show up as saying yes to everything because direct communication feels good, then crashing physically because you overcommitted. Or being so honest in  conversations that you forget your body needs gentle energy too. The lesson is that your voice and your wellness are connected… speaking your truth should energize you, not deplete you. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, Neptune shifts direct in Pisces on December 10th and your creativity, romance, and pleasure sector is finally getting forward momentum. Neptune retrograde had you seeing your patterns in love and art clearly… were you creating from authenticity or performing depth? Now direct motion helps you express and connect from the real place instead of the romanticized ideal. This is the final time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, wrapping up 14 years of learning the difference between destiny and delusion in romance. You might suddenly have clarity about which creative projects deserve your energy, which romantic connections are actually a match (not just full of potential), or where you’ve been using intensity as a substitute for  genuine intimacy. Use this time to express yourself authentically and choose connections that are real, not just promising. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, this is the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius activating your money and self-worth sector, and Mercury enters Sag on December 11th, making financial conversations and value declarations bold and unapologetic. You’re ready to charge what you’re worth, invest in yourself confidently, or simply stop undervaluing your resources because of old scarcity programming. But Mars in Sag also squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating tension between your financial ambition and the  romantic/creative clarity still settling. This square might manifest as wanting to spend money on creative projects or romantic gestures while you’re still figuring out if they’re  aligned with your authentic expression, or being overly generous financially because someone’s potential pulled on your heartstrings. This is teaching you that your resources should support your genuine passions and connections, not the fantasy versions. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th in your home and family sector, and the fog around your foundation is finally lifting. Neptune retrograde had you questioning what home even means and whether your emotional roots were solid or just familiar, and now forward motion helps you see which domestic patterns actually support you. This is the last time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your  lifetime, completing 14 years of learning that not all family dynamics need to be understood or fixed. You might suddenly have clarity about living situations, peaceful  detachment from family patterns that no longer serve you, or simply trust that home can look different than you thought it should. Use these final weeks of Neptune in  Pisces to solidify your foundation with intention; create the sanctuary that actually grounds your expansive nature instead of trying to force roots where they don’t fit. </p>



<p>This is also your final full week of Mars in your sign, plus Mercury enters Sag on December 11th, making your energy, communication, and confidence absolutely  unstoppable. You’re on fire — motivated, optimistic, saying yes to everything, and honestly probably overcommitting because it all sounds exciting. But here’s where the cosmic tension comes in: Mars in your sign squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating friction between your desire to charge forward boldly and the home/family clarity still integrating. This square might show up as wanting to book spontaneous  trips while your foundation feels unsteady, or being so focused on external adventure that you’re ignoring emotional needs at home. Use this final Mars in Sag week to take bold action on your goals, but don’t ignore the voice asking you to also tend to your emotional foundation before you sprint toward the next horizon. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, Neptune shifts direct in Pisces on December 10th and your communication  sector is getting the clarity you didn’t know you needed. For five months, Neptune  retrograde had you questioning how you express yourself and whether your words  were connecting or just filling space, and now forward motion helps you speak with both emotional depth and actual clarity. This is the final time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, ending 14 years of learning that vulnerability in communication doesn’t mean weakness. You might suddenly feel ready to have conversations you’ve been editing into safety, express emotions without needing  perfect delivery, or simply trust that your words land even when they’re not perfectly composed. Use these final weeks of Neptune in Pisces to solidify the emotional intelligence you’ve developed in how you communicate… you can be both practical  and tender with your words. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, this is the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius activating your spirituality and closure sector, and Mercury joins on December 11th, making your inner work and private processing move quickly. You’re motivated to finish healing that’s been  lingering, release what’s been hiding in your subconscious, or simply take action on closure you’ve been contemplating. Mars in Sag squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating friction between your desire to aggressively heal and the communication  clarity still settling. This square might show up as wanting to process everything alone when you actually need to talk it through, or being so focused on spiritual bypassing that you’re not having the practical conversations necessary for real closure. Use this final Mars in Sag week to take action on your inner work, but don’t forget that speaking your truth is part of the healing process. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th in your money sector and suddenly your financial fog is clearing. Neptune retrograde had you questioning  your relationship with abundance and whether your manifestation practices were  actually building wealth or just making you feel better temporarily, and now forward motion brings practical clarity. This is the last time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, completing 14 years of learning the difference between spiritual abundance and actual financial strategy. You might suddenly see which income streams are sustainable, where you’ve been spending emotionally instead of  intentionally, or how to merge your idealism with actual money management. Use these final weeks of Neptune in Pisces to get honest about your finances; you can be both  spiritual and strategic about abundance, but only if you’re willing to look at the numbers. </p>



<p>This is also the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius lighting up your friendship and community sector, and Mercury enters Sag on December 11th, making your social life and collaborative projects move at lightning speed. You’re ready to connect with your people, launch group projects, or simply show up boldly in communities that celebrate your evolution. Mars in Sag squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating tension between your social ambitions and the financial clarity still integrating. This square  might show up as wanting to invest heavily in community projects while your personal finances need attention, or being so generous with friends that you’re depleting your own resources. Use this final Mars in Sag week to build collaborative projects and authentic community, but set financial boundaries so you’re not funding everyone else’s dreams while neglecting your own stability. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, Neptune shifts direct in your sign on December 10th and honestly, who even are you after this retrograde? For five months, Neptune had you reviewing your entire  identity, and now forward motion helps you actually be the person you’ve been  discovering instead of just contemplating them. This is the final time Neptune will be  retrograde in your sign in your lifetime, meaning 14 years of identity dissolution and spiritual evolution are wrapping up. You might suddenly feel clearer about who you are (boundaries and all), less apologetic about your sensitivity, or simply ready to define yourself instead of being everything to everyone. These final weeks of Neptune in your  sign before it moves to Aries in January are crucial: solidify the boundaries, own the  identity, trust the evolution. You’ve spent over a decade being cosmically dissolved and rebuilt; now it’s time to actually live as the person who emerged from the fog. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, this is the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius activating your career sector,  and Mercury joins on December 11th, making your professional ambitions and public communication bold and unapologetic. You’re ready to go after career goals, pitch yourself confidently, or simply be seen professionally as the evolved version of yourself instead of who people expect. But Mars in Sag squares Neptune in your sign this  week, creating friction between your career ambition and your still-integrating identity.  This square might show up as pushing yourself professionally while your sense of self is still settling, or being so focused on external success that you’re ignoring the internal clarity still forming. The lesson is that career and identity work together… your professional path should reflect who you’re becoming, not who you previously were. </p>

Books are always a great gift and if you’ve got a friend whose love language is physical touch but they haven’t exactly cuffed this cuffing season yet, I’ve got the steamy literature that’s going to keep them warm. These two books by Nigerian-British <a href=""https://www.bolubabalola.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">author Bolu Babalola</a> are hot and spicy and go together like fried yam, plantain and eggs (Nigerian fam, did I get that food combo, right?).

<em>This holiday season, we’ve found the gifts that feel great to get and even better to give. Shop our collection of editor-approved holiday gift guides <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-art-of-giving"">here</a>.</em><br /><br />‘Tis the season for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-makeup-looks"">holiday parties</a>, and we’ll be remiss if you show up to these celebrations empty handed. It’s also time for visiting family (and perhaps over-staying your welcome) so it’s thoughtful to offer up some goodies as a “thank you.” Or maybe you have someone on your shopping list who just moved into a new place (or is the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/areaware-gift-guide"">self-proclaimed homebody</a> of your friend group). In any of these cases, we’ve curated a list of host and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-housewarming-gifts"">housewarming gifts</a> that’ll elevate your giftee’s spaces.<br /><br />Depending on your budget (and how generous you’re feeling this holiday season), this guide features a range of products between $20 and $200. For homebodies, consider luxe Quince robes, artsy Piecework puzzles, and eclectic Fellow tea kettles. For the new resident, opt for a smart Hatch alarm clock, viral Anthropologie glassware, and cozy Outdoor Fellow candles. And for the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hosting-friends-at-home-socializing"">holiday party host</a>, you can cart up olive oil dipping sets, unsuspecting board games, non-alcoholic drinks. <br /><br />And maybe it’s no surprise that a majority of these gifts deal with gathering around the table — from Le Creuset mini cocottes and Lenox cream and sugar sets to Caraway bar accessories and BonBon candy boxes — because food is universally the way to the heart.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11947454.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=768&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=4%3A3"" /></figure></div>



<p>It’s a Sunday afternoon. I’m sitting in a quiet Queens cafe, stirring my coffee across from the man I love when he says, calmly and rehearsed, <em>“I’ve never truly loved you. And I don’t think I ever will.”</em></p>



<p><em>Ouch. </em>Safe to say, blueberry pancakes will never taste the same again. </p>



<p>What followed was every <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2019/11/8894605/stages-of-breakup"">stage of heartbreak</a> you can imagine. Remorse, regret, rumination. I was moving through the world carrying the weight of loving someone who, if I’m being honest, didn’t even like me most days. Crying on the subway became a routine and <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/0l8zYqoUeBYg47Gmevq9HZ?si=zWdALid9QeaRFRvp2IB-JQ"">Olivia Dean’s <em>The Art of Loving</em></a> became my lifeline. </p>



<p>Just when I thought the world had shrunk to the size of my grief, life threw me a bone — a random, unexpected invitation to Club Med in the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dominican-republic-adventures"">Dominican Republic.</a> I didn’t know it yet, but this was the plot twist my heart so desperately needed.</p>



<p>A few days later, I was on a plane to the DR with five nights ahead at the all-inclusive <a href=""https://www.clubmed.us/r/punta-cana/y?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=SEA_BR_ALL_Google_US_EN_Multi-Product_LH_Multi-resort&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=19311535181&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD5uxODXrDAIWhxBxghEmlVF6ni1O&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAlrXJBhBAEiwA-5pgwp8yNRnmlZJS6fLh022jduivzrsivPRIKjdz7kmlzNfD-LCZ53IUUBoCK8AQAvD_BwE"">Club Med Punta Cana</a> and <a href=""http://utm_source"">Club Med Michès</a>. I’d never been to the Dominican, but after hours of Googling, I was convinced I’d found the perfect escape. After all, nothing heals a heartbreak faster than an open bar, right?<br /><br />Not quite.</p>



<p>To no one’s surprise, I spent the first few nights at the resort broken. As Black women, we don’t always feel held in our relationships. The breakup felt like a generational curse. Most days, I felt like I was screaming into the void to be truly seen, accepting half-hearted apologies, and enduring comments meant to make me feel small. Somebody call Madea and tell her to get <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@jellydivinti/video/7258625800293862699?lang=en"">the grits ready!</a></p>



<p>Then it clicked. Black women deserve luxury. We deserve softness. And dammit, we deserve an all-inclusive resort! So, I would become my ancestors’ wildest dreams. I was going to have a love story worth writing, even if the prince charming was me. </p>



<p>So the next day, I dragged myself out of bed, threw on my swimsuit, and decided I was going to become the best boyfriend I ever had.</p>



<p><strong>Spa Time: Luxury Lifts The Soul</strong></p>



<p>My first few days were spent at<a href=""https://www.clubmed.us/r/punta-cana/y""> Club Med Spa: Punta Cana</a>, where I discovered just how much luxury can lift the soul. Mornings started with an Aperol Spritz overlooking the Atlantic from the Buena Vista Lounge. The sun wrapped around me, giving me the warmth I’d been craving for weeks. The lounge also offered a buffet selection from every corner of the globe, Italian, Asian, Mediterranean, you name it. And did I mention I’m an emotional eater? I shut that buffet down.</p>



<p>Every evening, I attended one of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMiH_bZIpfN/"">Club Med’s classic parties</a>. Their iconic all-white party gave me the perfect excuse to put on heels and feel like myself again. Live bands and circus shows pulled me out of my head and I ended up meeting women who spanned across multiple generations each sharing their own chaotic stories about men. And suddenly, I didn’t feel so alone. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11947455.jpeg?width=803&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=803%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p><strong>Self-care As The Ultimate Breakup Cure</strong></p>



<p>Of course, the self-care didn’t stop there. I dove into<a href=""https://www.clubmed.us/l/wellness-fusion""> Club Med’s Wellness Fusion program</a>, attending yoga classes and guided meditation led by resident experts. I realized reclaiming my peace of mind wasn’t just about escaping heartbreak. It was about actively choosing to nurture myself in every way possible.</p>



<p>The last couple of days were spent at <a href=""https://www.clubmed.us/r/miches-playa-esmeralda/y?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=SEA_BR_ALL_Google_US_EN_Multi-Product_LH_Multi-resort&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=19311535181&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD5uxODXrDAIWhxBxghEmlVF6ni1O&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAlrXJBhBAEiwA-5pgwleHQUK6O-JvQBLBM1YN1ErnyPfAbI4camT0OkMvB9I0XW5SrRTL5RoCZNAQAvD_BwE"">Club Med Michès</a>, and let me tell you, this resort was a dream. The two resorts aren’t close to each other, Michès is about a two-hour drive east, tucked away in the El Seibo province, surrounded by lush palm groves, rugged mountains, and secluded beaches. The property stretches across 93 acres, offering everything from treetop yoga to Zen pools, making it feel like its own private world.</p>



<p>The buffet at Michès felt gourmet and fresh and I happily sampled everything, for research purposes, of course. </p>



<p><strong>Dancing It Out &amp; Letting The Sun Set On Heartbreak</strong></p>



<p>And then there was Miches’ all-white party. I drank with new friends from all over the globe, screamed <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kffacxfA7G4"">Justin Bieber’s “Baby”</a> at the top of my lungs. It was a moment of pure, chaotic joy and a reminder of how big the world really is.</p>



<p>And last but not least, the beach. This was my favorite part. The sun danced across the turquoise waves and to no one’s surprise, I cried. Not from sadness, but appreciation for being alive. To be able to love and to feel. Honestly, I could have stayed there forever. </p>



<p>With sunsets on horseback, spa treatments, and yoga flows as part of Club Med’s Wellness Fusion program, I realized Michès wasn’t just a vacation, it was a masterclass in reclaiming peace, indulgence, and joy.</p>

<p>Listen, men suck. And they have since the beginning of time. The trip didn’t completely erase my heartbreak, but it reminded me there’s so much more to life than one person’s opinion. There’s joy, connection, and peace waiting to be found. You don’t need an all-inclusive resort to heal, but sometimes it helps to step away, tend to your spirit, and let the world slow down. As I continue this journey of self-discovery, I hope to carry this sense of wonder and ease wherever I go.</p>

<p>As a major fan of the original <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/05/110716/best-fresh-prince-of-bel-air-episodes""><em>The Fresh Prince of Bel Air</em></a>, I was hesitant but eager to see what its <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/07/11752424/adrian-holmes-bel-air-season-3-uncle-phil-interview"">reboot <em>Bel Air</em> </a>would bring to the characters I hold very dear to my heart. In 2022 when the show premiered, I loved it instantly. Recently, we’ve seen so many reboots come and go, but <a href=""https://www.peacocktv.com/stream-tv/bel-air"">Peacock’s <em>Bel Air</em></a><em> </em>has succeeded where others have failed . By taking a beloved 30-minute sitcom and turning it into a compelling &amp; layered one-hour drama, <em>Bel-Air</em> brought something fresh and exciting to the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/02/10874708/bel-air-carlton-fresh-prince-reboot-backlash""><em>Fresh Prince </em>franchise</a>. The storylines and character arcs were so detailed and nuanced that it felt similar but brand new. While the show is indeed a drama that gets the heart pumping — looking at you, Geoffrey — it still has the warm feeling of a family truly showing what it means to show up for one another. For three seasons, I’ve laughed and even cried while watching <em>Bel Air</em>, and trust me, Season 4 will continue to take us on a rollercoaster of emotions. I was heartbroken when it was announced that this would be<em> Bel-Air’s</em> last season, </p>



<p>What started as a concept on YouTube <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAfJpyBgcgA"">six years ago by Morgan Cooper</a> has since flourished into Peacock’s longest running <em>and</em> most streamed original series. The execution of this show from start to finish is a testament to Black ingenuity and a reminder that art is for <em>all</em> of us. As <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/cassiedamsel/"">Cassandra Freeman</a>, who plays Aunt Viv told me over Zoom, “Your vision is not trite, it is worthy.” She continued: “The greatest artistic expression is [that] you were born to change other people’s lives with your vision..” A word.</p>



<p>Ahead of the <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@peacock/video/7576291076558851341"">Season 4 premiere</a>, I was able to share some laughs and get insight from <em>Bel-Air’s</em> cast on how they feel about the series’ final season, the growth of  their characters,  and the legacy they think <em>Bel Air </em>will leave.</p>



<p><strong>Refinery29: Congrats on the final season!  How do you feel about the growth of your characters over four seasons?</strong></p>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/02/10869393/coco-jones-bel-air-hilary-colorism""><strong>Coco Jones</strong></a><strong> (Hilary Banks): </strong>I feel pretty satisfied with my growth. I think that Hilary started off [more] surface.  She’s this influencer, this cute girl with sickening outfits. It was very lighthearted at the beginning and then you get to unravel the plights that she goes through and it’s real life. [Now, she’s] feeling like she doesn’t have a seat at the table and wanting to be the chef and people wanting to downplay her recipes, like they’re too spicy. This girl comes from this zip code, this net worth, but it didn’t buy her this easy life. It doesn’t buy her self-discovery. She still has to go through the highs and lows to figure out who she is. I’ve enjoyed really playing her, her arcs and her peaks and valleys.</p>



<p><strong>Akira Akbar (Ashley Banks):</strong> I feel really satisfied with Ashley’s growth among these seasons. We really got to see a teenage girl and what she goes through. When I was a younger teenager, I fully didn’t know who I was. I was still trying to figure out myself. I was exactly like Ashley. I think the writers really did a great job of portraying that on screen.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11947337.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>BEL-AIR — “Soulmates” Episode 407 — Pictured: (l-r) Akira Akbar as Ashley, Coco Jones as Hilary — (Photo by: Anne Marie Fox/PEACOCK)</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Cassandra Freeman (Aunt Viv):</strong> [Viv] started off as a politician’s wife, and by the end of this, she becomes a self-expressed artist. It’s been an amazing journey to play her. She’s trying to figure out how to speak her truth and take care of other people and [she] realizes the best way to take care of other people is to take care of yourself first. Take care of your passions first. Tell people the truth first. It’s been an honor to play her storyline.</p>



<p><strong>Olly Sholotan (Carlton Banks):</strong> I’ve never been happier. I think that the beautiful thing that these writers have done is they’ve taken such good care of our characters’ journeys, and I just know that by the time you get to the very end, fans are gonna be so proud of Carlton’s growth.</p>



<p><strong>Jabari Banks (Will Smith):</strong> I was gonna say proud. Proud of the people that our characters have become. Proud of their journeys and proud of where they’re going next. </p>



<p><strong>Jimmy Akingbola (Geoffrey Thompson):</strong>  We started very gentle with Geoffrey. It was a lot of sitting in a mystery and not resting on the wave of nostalgia. I’m an actor that loves to get my hands dirty. [I’ll roll] up my sleeves, gimme the ball, let me play. So I was very happy when we got into Season 3, where we got to see behind the layers of Geoffrey. I think Season 4 is the perfect way to sort of wrap things up because again, his past comes through the door. My key word for this season for Geoffrey is fracture. He fractures everything that he built with the Banks family. And I think it teaches you that there are consequences to every action you do in life. And this is the first time that Geoffrey is not in control… He’s under pressure. </p>



<p><strong>Jordan L. Jones (Jazz):</strong> Just the growth of my character in general has just been a blessing because when we first get the roles, it’s like you’re just cool with whatever. I’m playing Jazz. I’m not a part of the family, but my character has layers and layers and layers and layers. Coming up to Season 4, I think one of the main themes is about Jazz’s evolution [and] unconditional love. And just being strong enough to tell your significant other, or the person that you love, how you actually feel no matter what the circumstances are. As men too, we need to do that more often instead of trying to be hard all the time. That’s one thing that my character definitely has taught me. Some of the things that sound weak or feel weak or seem like what you shouldn’t do, [aren’t like that at all]. It feels like don’t express your feelings this way, but no, actually, instead of thinking <em>that’s weak</em>, I think that it actually takes a very strong person to do that.</p>



<p><strong>Adrian Holmes [Uncle Phil]:</strong> Philip Banks started out being that pillar for the family and over time, we start to see cracks in that pillar and just how  life has weighed on him and the pressures of being perfect. I think that the theme for him is legacy and building legacy is not what we leave behind for the next generation. It’s what we leave within the next generation — the impact, the lives we change, you know. I think that Philip has done a great job over the arc of this series in just empowering Will, empowering Carlton, and the family, and just letting them know that they are enough and they have all the tools they need and just really building them up to be the best versions of themselves. Also just embracing the simple things in life and inner peace. I think he’s just been so busy outside, looking outside that he hasn’t been able to really focus on the inside and over the time where we see him in this season, he starts to really look within more and appreciate the little things.</p>



<p><strong>What mark or message do you think<em> Bel Air </em></strong><strong>will leave once it is over?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Coco: </strong>If I had to say it would be to stay close to the people who love you back. You know, at the end of the day, they will be your support system. And you can have great accomplishments, but don’t forget the people who love you back and who really, truly know you because there’s always seasons and things change. And you wanna have the people that will always support you as close to you as possible.</p>



<p><strong>Cassandra: </strong> Titles change, positions fade, great successes get forgotten. But family is why they say charity starts at home.That’s the first one. And then the second thing is outside of the show, just the birth of it. I hope people realize if you have a great idea, you too can be Morgan Cooper and drop your thesis for an idea on YouTube. And your platform is how many people agree with you. And you not only will change your life, you’ll change everyone else’s life. That’s the greatest artistic expression. You were born to change other people’s lives with your vision. Your vision is not trite, it is worthy. </p>



<p>​​<strong>Akira:</strong> I think the biggest takeaway from <em>Bel Air</em> is family over everything. You can have all the friends in the world. They can come and go, but your family is always there</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11947339.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>BEL-AIR — “The Maybes” Episode 401 — Pictured: (l-r) Adrian Holmes as Philip, Cassandra Freeman as Vivian — (Photo by: Anne Marie Fox/PEACOCK)</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Simone Jones:</strong> I feel like it’s the ability to reinvent yourself and love yourself while you do it. And, also to really take care of your community because we’re gonna mess up. I feel like relationships now have become very temporary and very fragile. And so to watch,even just as a cast, we go through like our teens together in LA and something you’ve never seen before, and watching these characters kind of mirror a similar turbulent time. I think I want people to leave with, like, your community is really important to yourself and also everybody else.</p>



<p><strong>Olly:</strong> Man, Simone really took the words just kind of right outta my mouth. So everything she said, but put it in a slightly deeper voice.</p>



<p><strong>Jabari:</strong> She said something that  really stuck me there too. The reinvention, uh, you know, reinvention and, not being afraid to reinvent yourself. Not being afraid to reinvent in general. You know we’ve shown the world that just ’cause you know, you reinvent something doesn’t mean that it has to be corny or it doesn’t mean that it has to, you know what I’m saying? It can be a totally different thing, you know?  We are the living proof of that. </p>



<p><strong>Jordan:</strong>  I think for me, I think for our theme has been constant throughout four seasons, where like we’re just showing, all aspects of the Black experience. What I love about our show is that each one of our characters is going through a different black experience. We got me like the hustler. That’s like, I’m not broke, but I ain’t, I ain’t Uncle Phil, you know? Uncle Phil’s like the leader of the household. And then we, then we got Geoffery, who’s black 007. We got Will fish outta water. We got Carlton, who is very privileged. So it’s like I can, I can go down the line, but we’re showing that the black experience, </p>



<p><strong>Adrian:</strong> We’re not a monolith.</p>



<p><strong>Jordan:</strong> The black experience is not just one experience, like, come over here we’re black this is what we do. It’s not like that, you know? </p>



<p><strong>Adrian: </strong>Absolutely. We’re not defined by our trauma or our struggle.  You know, our joy is something to be celebrated. Our joy is our superpower. It’s our fuel, and that’s what keeps us resilient. I always say, we can bend, but don’t break. Our black joy is what prevents us from, from breaking and always surviving no matter how difficult the situations are. The issue is we always find a way to prevail. Our show, Bel Air has done a fantastic job of really showcasing that, you know?. We’re not a monolith. We are redefining what the black experience looks like on television.We need more of that narrative moving forward.  And hopefully there’s not a huge void after our show. </p>



<p><strong>All right, we’re going to end on a game called Bothered or Unbothered. I’m gonna throw you some rapid-fires questions and your answer is either Bothered or Unbothered. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Keeping family secrets. Bothered or Unbothered?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Coco:</strong> Hmm. Bothered. I [like to] get everything out in the open. I really love therapy and I can’t with a secret. It’s like mold. It’s just going to get everywhere.  Plus, I can’t remember everything I done said. Now I gotta keep up with the lies. I don’t know what I just said to you.</p>



<p><strong>Cassandra:</strong> I’m kind of unbothered because I’m starting to realize that if I am interested in what you’re cooking up all the time and in your pot, it just steals my joy. You can live your whole life knowing everybody’s secrets and never even deal with your own. So if it’s my secrets, I’m bothered. I’m gonna get it out. If it ain’t bothering me in my house, listen, you go over there. I ain’t got time for that. It’s too much, I’m unbothered.  </p>



<p><strong>Akira:</strong> My secret, I feel like I’ll be bothered and I’ll be like, I need to tell somebody, but someone else’s I don’t care.</p>



<p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Unbothered by that.</p>



<p><strong>Jimmy:</strong> Unbothered!</p>



<p><strong>Adrian:</strong> Unbothered.</p>



<p><strong>Jordan: </strong>Everybody don’t have to know what your family is going through.</p>



<p><strong>Jabari:</strong> It depends on the secret.</p>



<p><strong>Olly:</strong> Yeah. Like keeping family [secrets] in the family? Bothered. But I’m OK with keeping family secrets from outside people. I ain’t trying to tell our business. </p>



<p><strong>Jabari:</strong> Sometimes you gotta keep a little secret. Sometimes you have to. It’s best for the family. Mom don’t need to know that. Mom don’t need to know what Cuzzo did when we went out. Mom don’t need to know that. Keep it secret.</p>



<p><strong>Olly:</strong> I think what’s in the dark will always come to the light, so I don’t know about this one.</p>



<p><strong>Simone:</strong> Oh no. I feel I’m a big fan of everybody having all the information and then doing what you will with it.</p>

<p>As a beauty director for 10 years, I’ve tried enough <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charlotte-tilbury-exaggereyes-mascara-review"">Charlotte Tilbury products</a> to conclude that if all makeup production stopped and it were the only brand left, I’d be perfectly happy. I’m not the only one — my beauty editor peers and fellow R29 staffers praise the brand for its inclusive <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charlotte-tilbury-unreal-skin-sheer-glow-tint-review"">foundation shades</a> and campaigns featuring people of all skin tones and ages, Instagram-worthy packaging, dreamy textures, top-notch quality, and that you’re never left wanting. From blush to skincare and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charlotte-tilbury-perfume-fragrance-collection-of-emotions"">even fragrance</a>, there isn’t a product that Charlotte Tilbury hasn’t put her name on.</p>



<p>But with so many in the range, how do you know which ones are worth your hard-earned money? Luckily, I’ve been wearing a full face of Charlotte Tilbury for months, putting everything through its paces at weddings, during workouts, and at work. Here’s everything I’d recommend if you’re looking to expand your makeup collection.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>

<p>So many brands use the word “airbrush” to describe their products, but few actually live up to the hype. <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fairbrush-flawless-foundation-shade-4-neutral"">This one does</a>. I vividly remember applying it for the first time and being blown away by how well it blurred my large pores, hid leftover acne marks, and minimized my dark circles — and that was just one pump. It’s so packed with pigment that one pump is really all you need to cover your entire face. <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fbeautiful-skin-foundation-2-neutral"">Unlike Charlotte’s Beautiful Skin Foundation</a>, which has a dewy finish, this one is matte, but it eliminates the need for powder. I’m always impressed by how well it lasts without sliding off or settling into creases, and even with its impressive staying power, it still feels comfortable and skin-like. That’s thanks to the clever “Aircool” technology, which the brand says helps it withstand sweat and humidity. Even better, it’s non-comedogenic, so it’s unlikely to cause breakouts. Here, I’m wearing shade 5 Cool, but there are 44 shades to choose from.</p>

<p>As you can tell, I use this setting spray religiously. Even on days when I’m just wearing a tap of blush and a tinted moisturizer, it keeps everything in place for so much longer — and I’m constantly touching my face. Other setting sprays make my face and brows feel rock-hard, like my skin might crack, but not this one. It lets your face move and doesn’t leave behind any chalky residue. I also love that the nozzle is wide, so it covers your whole face in one or two spritzes — no waiting around for droplets to dry. It keeps my makeup looking and feeling fresh all day, but if you have very oily skin, you might prefer upgrading to the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fmini-airbrush-flawless-matte-setting-spray"">Airbrush Flawless Setting Spray Matte</a>.</p>

<p>This is the only matte lipstick that doesn’t leave my lips parched — and trust me, I’ve tried my fair share. Instead, it’s comfortably creamy without skimping on pigment. One swipe on my bottom lip, then pressing my lips together, is enough for me. The square-shaped bullet makes application so crisp and precise you could skip lip liner altogether. The nude shades don’t last as long as the bolder reds, obviously, but they still hold up surprisingly well. I can drink multiple cups of tea, eat a full meal, and still find it hanging on. Here, I’m wearing <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fmatte-revolution-lipstick-pillowtalk"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pillow Talk Original</a>, but the Pillow Talk collection is also available in shades Medium, Deep, and Fair. </p>

<p>This might be one of the pricier lip pencils out there, but I can honestly say it’s the best. I’ve never known one to last as long as this does. Often, my lipstick disappears by the end of the day, but the ghost of this liner is still visible. I love that the texture is equal parts creamy and waxy — you can blur it with your fingers, yet it won’t budge once you’re done.</p>

<p>This is the best mascara in Charlotte Tilbury’s collection, easily trumping <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fpillow-talk-push-up-lashes-mascara"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pillow Talk Push Up Lashes</a> and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Flegendary-lashes-vol2-volumising-mascara"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Legendary Lashes</a>. It’s all thanks to the exceptionally large, curved brush, which beefs up even the tiniest lashes in the inner and outer corners. Though it’s bigger than your average brush, it’s surprisingly easy to maneuver. I’m always pleasantly surprised by how much volume I get from just one coat, and I’ve never received so many compliments. Even better, it doesn’t smudge or run — and I have very oily skin, so that’s usually a given for me. And when it’s time to take it off, it melts away with a cream cleanser. No scrubbing required.</p>

<p>While there are a handful of palettes in Charlotte’s collection, I’m not exactly a dab hand with eyeshadow — but this quad makes building an eye look from scratch ridiculously easy. In fact, it’s the palette Charlotte’s bridal makeup artists always reach for because it’s so foolproof. Two mattes, one shimmer, and one extra-metallic shade make up the foursome, and each quad (there are 16 of them, by the way) is color-coded so you don’t have to stress about what goes with what. Want a smoky eye? Sweep the darkest shade through your crease and tap the metallic shade onto the center of your lid. I like using my fingers for the shimmers and metallics, and every shade blends together beautifully. It’s my go-to for nights out and weddings.</p>

<p>Allow me to introduce you to my favorite blush right now — it’s been in my makeup bag since it launched earlier this year. This stick makes application effortless thanks to its ultra-creamy base (a dream to blend) and buildable pigment. A couple of swipes bring my light olive skin to life, giving it a rosy sheen with ultra-fine shimmer flecks. It really does make your skin look like it’s glowing from the inside out. Some days, I even skip foundation and tap this onto my cheekbones and nose to pep up my complexion. Since it’s a cream, the staying power isn’t as long as Charlotte’s powder blushes, but it’s simple to top up on the go with your fingers. Here, I’m wearing <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Funreal-blush-stick-pinky-glow"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pinky Glow</a>, but it’s available in five more shades to suit all skin tones.</p>

<p>This unassuming eyeshadow pot is my secret weapon for creating a compliment-worthy eye look in seconds. The cream-to-powder formula is like an oyster shell of metallics and shimmers that catch the light from every angle, giving the effect of a painstaking, multi-step eyeshadow routine. I just swipe it on with my ring finger and blend the edges with a soft brush. It grips even my oily eyelids without creasing or separating — and a little goes a very long way. Here, I’m wearing <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Feyes-to-mesmerise-rose-gold"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Rose Gold</a>, but there are nine others to choose from.</p>

<p>I love the thin doe-foot applicator on this concealer — you can be really precise with placement rather than wiping out your features by going overboard. I have dry under-eyes, but this feels nicely moisturizing, which means it’s far less likely to settle obviously into fine lines and accentuate them. It also has brightening powers thanks to tiny, natural mica-based pearls that disperse across the skin and act like a built-in ring light for dark circles. And it’s not just a concealer: hydrating niacinamide and hyaluronic acid, skin-strengthening peptides, and antioxidant vitamin C make it basically skincare in disguise.</p>

<p>I’m not usually a fan of plumping glosses, but this one is built differently. First off, it doesn’t make my lips feel like they’re on fire. Instead, it has a cooling effect thanks to methyl diisopropyl propionamide, which I’m sure gets my blood pumping to the surface. If that doesn’t give your lips a lift, the light-reflecting pigments will. Like crushed diamonds, they create a 3D effect, giving the illusion of fuller, rounder lips. On top of that, it feels more like a comfortable lip oil than a sticky, hair-trapping gloss, so I actually want to keep applying it. A Charlotte Tilbury makeup artist recommended lining my lips, applying Pillow Talk lipstick, and then slicking this on top for a wedding-ready look.</p>

<p>This is one of the few pressed powders I’ve tried that genuinely feels like you’re not wearing anything. Many leave skin chalky or exaggerate texture, but this one gives just the right level of matte, taking down shine without making skin look flat. Plus, it lasts <em>forever</em>. </p>

<p>I much prefer Charlotte’s Glowgasm wands — essentially highlighter-blush hybrids — over the matte blushes because they add dimension and make my makeup look effortless, like I haven’t even tried. I always reach for Pinkgasm, though there are several shades to suit all skin tones. That gorgeous glow you see all over the brand’s Instagram? It’s almost always thanks to these. The formula melts into the skin, and the shimmer looks like a natural gloss rather than chunky glitter. Just make sure to twist the cap to “off” when closing the applicator, or be prepared for a messy spill.</p>

<p>I was gutted to hear that the brand’s Airbrush Bronzer is being discontinued, but this is the next best thing — and I think it lasts even longer on the skin than powder bronzers. One dot is all I need to define my cheekbones and add warmth to my complexion, and unlike other cream bronzers, it never looks muddy or gets stuck in my hairline. It blends effortlessly thanks to moisturizing ingredients like glycerin and skin-smoothing dimethicone. Again, be sure to turn the cap to “off” before putting it back inside your makeup bag.</p>

<p>Brow Lift is a bit too chunky for my liking, but <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fbrow-cheat-eyebrow-pencil-natural-brown"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Brow Cheat</a> is just right. The angled nib is smaller, letting you mimic fine brow hairs, and the pencil is creamy enough to fill in sparse patches quickly. It never fades or smudges on me, and I love the spoolie on the end for feathering out the pigment and creating natural-looking brows. I’ll admit, I’m not the biggest fan of the brand’s ultra-thin Brow Fix brow gel for my wiry brows — but if your brow hairs are finer, you’ll probably love it, as it’s totally inconspicuous.</p>

<p>Move over, Victoria Beckham Beauty. This is, in my opinion, the best eyeliner pencil out there right now. It’s creamy enough to create a smudgy, smoky eye, yet long-lasting enough for a sharp, block-winged look. I trick I’ve learned is to use the edge of my nail to sharpen things up, and I’m always so impressed with how well it lasts at the end of a night out.</p>

<p>I recently replaced all my tired, scratchy makeup brushes with <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fthe-complete-brush-set"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Charlotte Tilbury’s complete set</a>, and I won’t go back. I’ve never used brushes this soft, but don’t underestimate them. They’re plush and dense, making blending cream and powder products an absolute dream. My most-used brush is the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fhollywood-complexion-contour-brush"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Complexion Brush</a>, which I reach for with foundation, blush, and concealer.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946768.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>There are several reasons why finding the right dry shampoo is a tricky feat. For starters, it’s not guaranteed that it will actually help your hair feel cleaner and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/greasy-oily-hair-after-washing"">absorb excess oil </a>— and that’s not even taking into consideration whether or not it’ll leave a chalky cast in its wake. And if there’s one person who feels uniquely primed to put the stuff through its paces, it’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/chloe-kim-snowboarder-mental-health-interview"">Chloe Kim</a>.</p>



<p>The Olympic snowboarder — who the world met in the 2018 Winter Games as a bleached blonde — has recently returned to her brunette roots. Given that her job requires more time in a snug, sweat-trapping helmet than the average person, when she says she swears by Batiste to keep her roots feeling and looking fresh, I — a fellow dark brunette — am inclined to believe her.</p>



<p>“I remember using Batiste for the first time and being like, <em>oh my gosh, this works</em>,” she tells Refinery29, days before going to intensive training ahead of the upcoming 2026 Olympics in Italy. “Especially with my travel and training, it’s one of those necessities that I need on the go.” Her favorite formula? The <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/zen-matcha-light-dry-shampoo-pimprod2049243?sku=2633384"">Zen Matcha Light Dry Shampoo</a>, which uses rice starch to mop up excess oil and has a refreshing chamomile, green tea, and sandalwood scent.</p>

<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>On her favorite skincare of the moment </h2>



<p>“My skincare routine these days consists of Medicube,” Kim tells me — and it makes total sense considering the brand’s toner pads have become a cult staple among K-beauty obsessives and R29 staffers alike. “I love their toner pads and face masks, especially the collagen masks,” adds Kim.  For her, that reliability becomes essential when she’s travelling: “When I’m on the road, especially for snowboarding, where I’m in very dry climates, it’s all about moisturize, moisturize, moisturize.” We love <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/collagen-niacinamide-jelly-cream-pimprod2053650?sku=2645369"">Medicube’s Collagen Niacinamide Jelly Cream</a> for its glass skin-bestowing ingredients like collagen, squalane, and niacinamide.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>On returning to her brunette roots</h2>



<p>While Kim might be known for her incredible hair today, the journey getting there wasn’t exactly smooth sailing. “Bleaching was rough for my hair, I’m not going to lie. I had to chop it when it was bleached, which was sad, but when I went back to brunette, I was able to grow it out, and I started caring more about my hair when I saw that it was growing back very healthy.” Kim says that it’s about having a consistent routine, but mainly, taking care of your scalp. “My scalp was always so oily and congested, and I would wash it all the time. And then that’s when I discovered Batiste dry shampoo,” she says. The <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/zen-matcha-light-dry-shampoo-pimprod2049243?sku=2633384"">Zen Matcha Light Dry Shampoo</a> buys you more time between washes — ideal if you’re as busy as Kim — thanks to oil-absorbing rice starch. It’s also packed with moisturizing glycerin and calming plant extracts to keep your scalp healthy and comfortable.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>On her Olympics hair routine</h2>



<p>Kim’s secret to excellent hair is practice — and then some. “Honestly, it’s like muscle memory at this point. I just know where to pull from,” she says of her accidentally perfect strands. “I will say when I sleep with heatless curls in, I get a really cute wave. So when I pull my strands out, they’re perfect.” To make the most of your beauty sleep, try <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/satin-heatless-curling-set-pimprod2031918?sku=2592934"">Kitsch’s Satin Heatless Curling Set</a>, which cuts down on frizz and breakage while delivering bouncy, defined ringlets.</p>



<p>Kim laughs as she thinks back to her early snowboarding days, when bigger always felt better. “I used to like [my waves] really thick,” she adds, “so I’d pull out a pretty big chunk, but then it started obstructing my vision when I was doing tricks, so I had to tone it back a bit.”</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>On her experimenting with beauty</h2>



<p>Looking back on her beauty routine throughout the years, Kim — whose signature look is a matte nude lip and feathered brows — says she’s switched things up so many times. “I got into makeup when I was young, and then hair came shortly after. I wanted to dye it all these crazy colors and do all of that fun stuff — I’m all about it. When I first started doing makeup, I always had to have eyeliner, usually a little wing. I also loved mascara and got into BB cushions too.” (One of her go-to’s is the <a href=""https://global.oliveyoung.com/product/detail?prdtNo=GA230518794"">Laneige Neo Cushion</a>, which packs hydrating properties and sheer coverage in a light-as-air formula].</p>

<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/december-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">December opens</a> a prophetic window for us. It is a transitional pause and an opportunity to integrate all the lessons we’ve gathered throughout the year and lock it in before moving onto the new year portal. Here we get to rest, recalibrate our energies, and focus on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-zodiac-sign-2025"">setting intentions</a> for the new year. It is a moment between endings and beginnings, and if we are silent enough, we can hear Spirit’s whispers on what’s next. <br /><br />This month’s tarotscopes reveal the frequency you’ll be walking into in 2026: the blessings you’ve earned, the lessons that are wrapping up, and the energy that will define your next chapter. You are always the energetic architect of your present and future. Now allow these tarotscopes to guide you toward alignment. <figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946629.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Capricorn: 3 of Pentacles <br /></h2></strong><br />It’s time to level up your foundation and your standard in every area of your life. If 2025 has taught you anything, it’s that you deserve it all, but you have to embody it and start making choices that reflect that reality. Review your foundations in all areas of your life: spirituality, health, relationships, finances, career, beauty, and more. Evaluate what worked versus what didn’t, and what is the next level for you in these areas of your life. You’re no stranger to effective work and dedication. Everything that you’ve been applying yourself in 2025 will blossom in 2026. The 3 of Pentacles reminds you that collaboration is your currency, so don’t hesitate to ask for help or resources. You don’t have to do a whole rehaul of your life alone. Let Source do the heavy lifting for you and bring you the right people, places, and opportunities. Let your excellence be seen. This is your year to master your craft and be rewarded for it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946624.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Aquarius: 2 of Wands<br /></h2></strong><br />This is your year to push your limits in terms of being seen and allowing your brilliance and genius to shine. The coming year will encourage you to expand in every area of your life; you must be fearless and confident with your momentum. In 2026, you will find yourself in new territory that requires a more regulated nervous system. You are worthy and capable of having and maintaining all of your desires. Nothing you encounter will be familiar, but it will be elevated. Your task is to not fall back into old patterns. Instead, decide and commit that you will raise your vibration as the new standard. It is time to move differently because you’ve outgrown so much in your life and you’re now ready for what you deserve. The world is literally opening up for you, and now is the time that you take advantage of all the inner work and effort you’ve done. It is all up to you. You get to choose your path and adventure.  </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946633.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Pisces: 3 of Swords</h2></strong><strong><br /></strong>The new year requires that you continue to release and cleanse from inside out. It is the karmic release that brings sweet blessings and makes space for the life you truly deserve to live, but it cannot pour in if you are subconsciously or even consciously still holding on to energies that you’ve inherited ancestrally or baggage that weighs you down. What is being cleared from your life will free you to focus on your purpose and projects that have been brought to your attention. This is purification, not punishment. Cut emotional cords and ties to old stories, people, places, past lives, habits, and even obligations that you’ve outgrown. Update your life with immense clarity. You know what you don’t want, and this can help give you insight on what you do. Focus on that and fine-tune the details on what that looks and feels like in every area. Don’t bind yourself to things that no longer bring pleasure or require labor in a way that doesn’t expand you. Update the way you do things and the way you frame your life. You must live your truth by all means necessary.  </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946627.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Aries: King of Swords<br /></h2></strong><br />This is the year of implementing a great strategy and upgrading your education and knowledge. Investing in yourself will be key to your growth and success. This coming year calls for clarity, precision, and mastery over your mind. Your words will carry profound weight, so this is the time to speak things into existence or create a journal practice where you can script things into existence or release emotions through the process. If you’ve failed to advocate for yourself, you will be bolder, sharper, more direct, clearer, and confident when negotiating in all areas of your life and discerning what you truly deserve versus what is being presented to you. Do not settle. Honesty is key this year. It’s best to stick to what you have decided to commit to and not stray off the path. In 2026, you will not be reactive but responding from your power and ability to see into the future. Refine your voice and leadership abilities. Trust that you know what is best for you, and the world will follow your direction. Leave the ego behind and leverage your superpowers. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946636.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Taurus: Queen of Wands<br /></h2></strong><br />This is a year of radical independence, sexual energy, and potent power. The Queen of Wands is your reminder that confidence <em>is</em> a currency and the more you flaunt it, the more your desires will gravitate to you. This is an unstoppable time when your spirit is finally aligned with an elevated identity. There’s nothing that you cannot have, be, or do. Your magnetism and charm require that you delegate and make your life simple, so that the “work” you do is more easeful and impactful. Stop playing small with your gifts and allow your free spirit to lead. You no longer need permission to be the fullest version of yourself. In this timeline, you are safe and abundant — trust that. Expect radical expansion in your business or career, finances, sex life, confidence, spiritual journey, and femininity. You will inspire many others to take up space.  </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946630.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Gemini: Page of Swords<br /></h2></strong><br />This is the year you invoke more curiosity and play. You will be reinventing yourself in ways that will shock others. Your ingenuity and ability to not only adapt to the time but shift it for the better is memorable and will forever change your life. You are not here to follow. Instead, you are here to lead and be an example for so many that want to break free from their limitations but need “permission” to do so. Your ability to flip the script and explore what now suits you versus what no longer applies will create a new identity for you that generates more wisdom and abundance and expands on your legacy. You are invited to stay teachable, lead with intellect and discernment, and use your innate spiritual technology that lives within you to reinvent ways of living that are efficient and needed. Great expansion lies in entrepreneurship and possibly the writing industry. Fresh ideas will come fast, so capture them before they fade. Just be mindful not to overthink. Learn as you go. Spirit’s saying: Your voice is evolving, so let it. What you study, share, and speak this year becomes the foundation of a new identity.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946628.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Cancer: 9 of Pentacles<br /></h2></strong><br />Cancer, 2026 is your soft life era, fully earned and fully embodied. The 9 of Pentacles confirms that your discipline and devotion are paying off. You can finally rest and let things come to you energetically rather than working toward a greater legacy. Everything you’ve built and worked on will manifest tenfold this year, so prepare to be in total overflow. This is the time to invest in upleveling your beauty, inner confidence, and luxury overall. Invest in yourself by pouring into you in ways that you were hesitant before. The luxury you will claim is rooted in self-worth, not validation from others. Your connection to the Divine is so unshakable that you have no doubt where your Source lies. Everything you touch will bloom. There is no limit to your magic and expansion.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946631.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Leo: 8 of Cups<br /></h2></strong><br />Leo, 2026 is your walk-away year, a period where you continuously choose yourself until that energy is locked into your DNA and you act from a space of Royal Sovereignty and opulence. This means that you are in a continual space of releasing not only that which you’ve outgrown but also what no longer resonates with you. You’ve found the secret of rapid quantum leaping, and it will seem like you’re jumping from one timeline to the next. This constant leap of transition marks that you are expanding your soul and are increasing your capacity to have more in every area of your life. The theme of 2026 is do not settle. You will have it all and more, and then you’ll realize that you deserve even more than what you initially thought. Flow with the momentum your inner Source and GPS is leading you on. You are not in perpetual cleansing and releasing but rather in perpetual becoming. You are no longer loyal and committed to things you did not choose for yourself. You are no longer holding space for energies and patterns you’ve inherited but have had no say on. Drop the struggle and the load. The journey ahead is about becoming light and sustaining it. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946637.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Virgo: Judgement<br /></h2></strong><br />Your spiritual glow up and understanding of where your own inner Source is leading you to are undeniable. You have no choice but to step ahead, regardless of your own irrational fears. Your higher calling is presenting itself to you and it is divine time that you answered. The Judgement card marks a rebirth: You’re shedding old versions of yourself, stepping into full purpose, and hearing Spirit loud and clear, as a lifestyle. Everything that felt confusing in 2025 suddenly aligns, and the rewards come through because you’re ready to live in truth and not illusion. Your ancestors are calling you into greater service in so many ways, to lead, to heal, to teach, and to transmit your wisdom. You will not have the space to second-guess yourself, and you won’t even think of it because your connection to Source will be so undeniable that you will let Source take the wheel and do the heavy lifting. This is your awakening year, and the miracles will overflow. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946632.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Libra: Queen of Cups<br /></h2></strong><br />This is the year when you soften further and rest in your divine feminine energy. It is a year of ease, peace, comfort, and radical self-trust. The Queen of Cups invites emotional mastery, not through control but rather through surrender. You will have the resources to process any emotion skillfully and also activate your psychic and intuitive gifts on a new level. This is a non-negotiable. You’re learning that sensitivity is strength and that your intuition is your most reliable currency. Allow it to speak to you in ways it hasn’t before and use it more actively. This year, your healing, creativity, and compassion become magnetic forces that open new doors in love and purpose. Spirit’s asking you to pour from a full cup, not a fractured one. Where you once overgave, that stream is now closed for your own use. Spirit will be speaking to you loudly, and the more you indulge in your own sweetness and softness, the more things will flow in your favor. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946635.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Scorpio: The Emperor  <br /></h2></strong><br />Scorpio, 2026 is all about embodying authority and creating the systems, routines, and discipline that will take you to the next level. The Emperor shows that you’re no longer playing with your potential; you are utilizing your masculine energy to build a structure that is the epitome of long-lasting wealth. It is a year when every area of your life is about to massively expand, but this comes with you enforcing strong boundaries and getting very clear on what it is you want. You won’t have time to entertain anything that isn’t for you or is underneath you. Own your power and claim the spotlight. You will have to become the leader that you’re seeking. There is no blueprint for your life; you are creating it along the way. Manifest your empire through organization and clarity. You’ve done enough dreaming.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946634.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Sagittarius: 5 of Swords<br /></h2></strong><br />Sagittarius, 2026 will pull you into radical honesty and will reveal all of your energetic leakages — or rather where you are being drained energetically in all areas of your life. Prepare to rid yourself of people, ways of being, and potential trajectories you thought you’d be on, and embark the journey of uncertainty. This year asks that you allow Spirit to take the wheel and provide the next steps and resources for you. This requires that you surrender and have faith in the journey unfolding. Don’t battle yourself. Preserve your energy for things that enhance and excite it. Playing small, over-explaining yourself, entertaining energetic vampires, and engaging in drama will no longer play a vital role in your life. You are clearing out old wounds and acting from a space of deliberate intention. Peace over everything — that’s how your blessings unfold. </figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

On Wednesday evening (05.11.2025), the largest full moon of the year can be seen over Germany – a so-called supermoon. According to the Association of Astronomers (VDS), the moon will then appear particularly large because it will only be around 356,400 kilometers away from the Earth at 11.16 pm. At other times, the moon is more than 400,000 kilometers away from the Earth. Photo: Patrick Pleul/dpa (Photo by Patrick Pleul/picture alliance via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As we come nearer to closing out 2025, the Cold Moon in Gemini on December 4th serves up some positivity for us all in the midst <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Sagittarius season</a> — putting us in an excellent mindset. In short: It is the vibe shift we’ve been waiting for. </p>



<p>This is the second-to-last <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/super-beaver-full-moon-in-taurus-horoscope-november-2025-meaning-effects"">supermoon in the series</a>; the next one occurs on January 3rd 2026. A supermoon occurs when the moon is in proximity to the earth in parity. When this happens, we feel the effects of illumination more deeply and intensely as the moon appears to be fuller, brighter, and shinier.</p>



<p>The last Full Moon of 2025 is asking us to make crucial decisions before New Year. We are torn between two different directions, offering us the chance to evolve or stay the same. The caveat is that we may not be ready to move forward, as numerous loose ends need to be addressed. These issues have been swept under the rug because we’ve been lost in a sea of emotions this past month, when five planets were retrograde, tugging at our heartstrings and making us yearn for the past. It’s no wonder we’ve been in a haze.</p>



<p>As we dust off the stale vibes, the Full Moon calls upon us to be more open with our emotions and discuss them with others. Since the Nodes of Destiny are squaring the lunation, we need to be ready to state our opinions. There can be issues in communication, causing problems with others. Still, if we mentally grow and use this opportunity to be more direct and not hold back, then we will be able to move past the internal conflict and tension that we are feeling. Letting go of our old patterns will be challenging, and we may fluctuate throughout the process. It’ll take a minute, even though we are starting the journey now.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury is still in its “retroshade”</a> phase since the planet ended its retrograde on November 29th. Mercury is still dealing with situations brought on by the retrograde until December 16th, when it clears the post-shadow zone. As a result, we may still be dealing with issues from then, as Mercury is revisiting that timeline. Therefore, it’s essential to think before speaking and not act impulsively, as there may be sensitivities that others feel, including ourselves. Being kind and compassionate is always crucial in times like these, especially since the mutable Supermoon takes on the sentiments of those surrounding them.</p>



<p>Remember that three planets are currently moonwalking in the sky: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter in Cancer</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uranus-retrograde-gemini-taurus-september-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Uranus in Taurus</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/neptune-retrograde-in-aries-pisces-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Neptune in Pisces</a>. While they don’t have an intense or immense impact on us, they’ll reveal the motives of others. They are helping us to understand the importance of living our best lives — no matter what’s gone down in the recent past. The future seems to be prosperous and infinite, giving us an optimistic push toward our aspirations.</p>



<p>This energy is highlighted by the presence of the star Cursa (fixed stars add seasoning to the flavor of planets), which plays an important role during this lunation. Being that Cursa is beneficial and lucky, we’ll be able to get through problems without a hitch. The universe is offering us the opportunity to enhance our fortune by giving us an abundance of love and kindness. Cursa is making us extremely sociable and wanting to connect with others. Beware that it can unlock scandals, so don’t repeat rumors that may or may not be valid. </p>



<p>Even though things may seem grim before the Full Moon, the energy will give us the motivation to tap into the power within ourselves. This is an opportunity for us to make things better — especially for ourselves and those we care about.</p>
