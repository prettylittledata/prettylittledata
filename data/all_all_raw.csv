I’ve now lived through two platform shifts up-close: the dawn of the consumer internet and the explosion of Web 2.0's networked creativity. <br />The lesson that stuck is simple: the most exciting tools are rarely the safest place to store your work.</em></p><p><em>Since then, I’ve come to think about software apps the way I think about roads: no matter how promising they feel today, they only truly matter if they let you move your work tomorrow. The current wave of AI-driven tools is no different.</em></p><p><em>What follows is a custom guide to the software stack I currently use when the work is important enough to ship, and to keep: a map of resources for fellow travelers. These apps are relatively cheap right now, useful immediately, but, crucially, unlikely to disappear without warning.</em></p><p><em>Consider this a collection of best-practice notes from the messy, dusty, and always unpredictable journey of contemporary digital creative production.</em></p><h3>The Negro Motorist</h3><p>In 1936, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Hugo_Green"">Victor Hugo Green</a>, a travel writer based in Harlem, New York, began publishing <a href=""https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/9ea5d5b0-1117-0132-7932-58d385a7b928""><em>The Negro Motorist Green Book</em></a> as a practical guide for Black travelers moving through <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws"">Jim Crow America</a>: where you could eat, sleep, refuel, and keep going without being turned away or put in danger.</p><p><em>The Green Book</em> was a safety instrument under segregation and racial violence, a tool for mobility when the environment was hostile, arbitrary, and unevenly dangerous. Its historical significance, and prescience, lies both in what it contained and in what it implied: that for a certain cohort — Negro Motorists in the first half of the 20th century — even an ordinary activity like travel required sophisticated and updated situational awareness.</p><p>The point was not aspiration, even though <a href=""https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcscd.00212275098/?st=pdf&amp;r=-0.272%2C-0.077%2C1.543%2C1.543%2C0&amp;pdfPage=6"">that came later</a>, too. It was <em>navigation</em>: how to keep moving through a landscape where the rules and their enforcement were inconsistent and the definition of safety could change from town to town. The guide’s power also came from refusing romance, or even overt political discourse. It treated movement — and <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/11/AR2010091105358.html"">community</a> — as a practical problem solved by lists, routes, and verified stops.</p><p>Between 1936 and 1966, Victor Hugo and his wife <a href=""https://abitofhistoryblog.com/2019/03/25/the-mother-of-the-green-book-ignored-by-history/"">Alma Duke Green</a> documented an informal infrastructure of Black-owned and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Negro_Motorist_Green_Book#Influence"">Black-welcoming enterprises</a>, making it plain that “freedom of movement” was conditional — negotiated stop by stop, sometimes even door by door.</p><p><em>The Green Book</em> was about survival inside a system of laws, customs, and institutional practices that enforced racial subordination in the United States from the late 19th century through the mid-20th century. It has now become — through the inexorable passing of time and the well-deserved attention of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Negro_Motorist_Green_Book#Representation_in_other_media"">mainstream popular culture</a> — an archive of the extreme measures people had to take to live normally in an abnormal system.</p><p>Maps are never neutral, and “safety” is always socially produced. <br />Risk is unfairly distributed, even inside something as banal as travel, or as contemporary as software adoption.</p><blockquote>“Watch the driver ahead — you can’t be sure whether or not he’ll signal when he turns.”</blockquote><p><a href=""https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcscd.00212275098/?sp=13&amp;st=image"">Safe Driving Rules, #5.

Jim Crow travel was structured by racial terror, state-backed exclusion, and real physical danger: a set of existential threats, not of market or employment inconveniences. But the navigation-under-structural-risk problem is increasingly similar in <em>texture</em>.</p><p>From here on in, <a href=""https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/artificial-intelligence/ai-impact-job-growth"">white-collar workers entering an AI-shaped landscape</a> will have to learn to chart the course of their careers <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/same-same-but-new-ux-research-in-the-age-of-llms-36285d007845"">differently</a>: through territories they don’t control, under rules that can change overnight, where access can be denied without explanation, and where “safe” often means having a credible fallback and a way to keep moving independently.</p><p>Disruption, as usual, will be unequally distributed: education, class, race, citizenship status, and even credential signaling will all increasingly shape who gets stopped, rerouted, and pushed off the road.</p><p><em>The Green Book</em> offers a possible methodology of resistance: don’t confuse <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/escaping-ai-sludge-why-mvps-should-be-delightful-04d267292458"">novelty</a> with safety, don’t build your projects on top of a tool without exports, don’t treat a “magical” product as permanent infrastructure — and always know when to leave.</p><p>So here is a road atlas for your digital work, whether you’re a solo operator, creative lead, founder, marketer, team manager<strong>, </strong>or any of the other millions of algorithmic clerks going through these societal changes: five safe stops I base professional projects on, a few high-yield bets I use with my bags packed, and the outer limits of what’s currently possible.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/0e7ceba4b53fc0d8ae2f10e0d875a753/href"">https://medium.com/media/0e7ceba4b53fc0d8ae2f10e0d875a753/href</a><h3>Rules of the Road</h3><p>Whenever the software market is overheated, tools usually fail slowly, like the softening deformation of an asphalt road on an unforgiving summer afternoon. Pricing flips, exports vanish, access tightens, a feature becomes “premium”, a company pivots.</p><p>I score every app I use against five plain criteria: <em>durability, portability, redundancy, composability, and cost realism</em>.</p><p>These are not abstract, idealistic principles, but the practical inheritance of a philosophy of <a href=""https://opensource.org/osd"">open source</a>, open <a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/"">networks</a> and protocols, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair"">the right to repair</a>. I believe in systems that endure, interoperate, and let you rebuild.</p><figure><img alt=""A detailed illustrated poster titled “Building a Better Web,” presenting core design principles of the open web with icons and short explanations arranged in panels."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Wej4os-97JAuQCJA3O5Ahg.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/"">NotebookLM’s visual interpretation of the Web Platform Design Principles</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Durability</strong> is the “<em>will this place still be open in three years?</em>” test: business model, runway, incentives, and whether the tool sits on infrastructure that tends to persist. Important software <a href=""https://jacobin.com/2025/07/artificial-intelligence-regulation-public-utility#:~:text=By%20Matt%20Huber%20Holly%20Buck,to%20our%20beautiful%20print%20quarterly."">should be treated like a utility</a>, and be able to survive a specific company’s lifespan if users and communities can maintain, fork, and redistribute it under sensible terms.</p><p>Durability matters because professional work is compounding: if the tool disappears or “pivot-kills” your workflow, you lose features, momentum, institutional memory, and trust.</p><p><strong>Portability</strong> asks a harsher question: “<em>If I had to leave tonight, could I take my work with me in a usable form?</em>” This is where open web protocols are an important reference point: the web works at scale because identity, data formats, and protocols enable movement between agents, not captivity inside one vendor’s establishment.</p><p>Ideas around the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse"">Fediverse</a> extend that logic to social networks: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub"">ActivityPub</a> and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol"">ATP</a> are federation protocols where servers can share information without belonging to any single company.</p><p>Portability matters because it turns migration from a crisis into a routine. Clean exports, sane APIs, and open formats are the digital version of the right to repair consumer hardware electronics and other devices.</p><p><strong>Redundancy</strong> is portability plus discipline: not only “<em>can I leave</em>,” but “<em>can I keep a second home warm so I’m never stranded?</em>”</p><p>The Fediverse is redundancy-as-architecture: many independently managed instances, interoperating through a shared protocol, so no single outage or owner decision can kill the network.</p><p>In platform terms, redundancy means mirrorable backups, periodic exports, and a fallback surface. It matters because <a href=""https://policyreview.info/articles/analysis/what-if-facebook-goes-down-ethical-and-legal-considerations-demise-big-tech"">hostile environments rarely fail politely</a>. Redundancy converts sudden shutdowns, paywall cliffs, and account bans into an inconvenience instead of a catastrophe.</p><p><strong>Composability</strong> measures whether a tool plays well with others, and the degree to which it can sit inside a larger ecosystem of workflows without demanding total allegiance.</p><p>You should be able to swap software components, like LEGO, without rebuilding everything. Open-source culture reinforces this by treating interoperability and reuse as virtues, not threats. Licensing and community norms encourage recombination rather than <a href=""https://medium.com/@yurilopespereira/the-internet-of-kings-78acd3f12340"">enclosure</a>.</p><p>Composability matters because the durable stack is rarely one piece. It’s more akin to a choreography, or <a href=""https://zapier.com/blog/ai-orchestration/"">an orchestra</a>.

That was the year <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities"">Geocities</a> was created, “ the world’s first major online publishing network” that allowed millions of users to create personal homepages for free. In now classic <a href=""https://uclpress.co.uk/book/the-web-as-history/"">internet history</a> fashion, the web hosting service first started and became notable as a fervent community of passionate amateurs, then slowly introduced paid premium features and advertising before going public in 1999.</p><p>At the height of the dot-com-bubble, Geocities was the third-most visited website on the web. It was acquired by Yahoo! soon after and began the soon-to-be predictable and unfortunate process of <a href=""https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374619329/enshittification/"">making things worse and unbearable for its users</a>. I never inhabited Geocities’ wild landscape — more of an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRC"">IRC</a> traveler in those days — but I witnessed what many friends at the time described as a feeling of <a href=""https://www.dhi.ac.uk/san/waysofbeing/data/communities-murphy-turkle-1997c.pdf""><em>homelessness</em></a>, when the bubble burst and the lights went out.</p><p>About ten years later, I did commit enormous effort, time, and affection to an up-and-coming, real-time, Web 2.0 feed aggregator called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FriendFeed"">FriendFeed</a>.</p><p>In hindsight, it’s not surprising that the service, created by the likes of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Taylor"">Bret Taylor</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Buchheit"">Paul Buchheit</a>, anticipated so many features of the web that we now take for granted — and many others that the Fediverse crowd is still struggling to implement, twenty years later. Like <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20110705022541/http://friendfeed.com/about/help"">a unified timeline</a>, or <a href=""https://www.edge.org/conversation/david_gelernter-john_markoff-clay_shirky-lord-of-the-cloud""><em>lifestream</em></a>, that is customizable and pulls information from all kinds of different sources like blogs, social networks, email, and other web protocols like RSS. It was beautiful while it lasted.</p><blockquote>Lifestreams was already my idea that instead of keeping my information in separate pieces of digital Tupperware with some of it in this app, and some of it in that app, and some of it in the file system, and some of it in my Web browser, and some of it on my laptop, and some in my palm, and some in my cell, and blahblahblah — I didn’t want to do that. I wanted every information object I owned arranged in an electronic diary or journal or narrative. Or ‘Lifestream’ is what I call it.</blockquote><p><a href=""https://www.edge.org/conversation/david_gelernter-john_markoff-clay_shirky-lord-of-the-cloud"">David Gelernter (2009). <em>Lord of the cloud</em>. Edge.</a></p><p>You already know how the story ends: on August 10, 2009, <a href=""https://about.fb.com/news/2009/08/facebook-agrees-to-acquire-sharing-service-friendfeed/"">Facebook agreed to acquire FriendFeed</a>. The one million or so users still struggled for a minute to compose a new, open version of the service, but the tide of capital and circumstance in Silicon Valley has almost always prevailed over such valiant efforts.</p><p>That time around, I felt the burn first-hand. FriendFeed was my first real lesson in the difference between <em>a place</em> and <em>a lease</em>. I watched, in horror, a beloved tool that felt and behaved like the future get absorbed into a larger, indifferent machine.</p><p>The lesson here isn’t that good ideas either fail or get coopted by major corporations — that’s just standard operating procedure. The learning is that one should <em>always</em> trust the boring infrastructure more than the brilliant interface: open protocols, portable archives, and safe travels.</p><figure><img alt=""A meme showing two cats fighting, overlaid with text labeling one as “Twitter” and the other as “FriendFeed,” suggesting a rivalry between social platforms."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*NddgYYTUSa0O5QYqIgkkLA.jpeg"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/40531091@N07/3728219439/"">2009 meme, by Zoe_NZ</a></figcaption></figure><h3>The Safe Stops</h3><p>Before the map begins, a note about what this section is, and what it refuses to be: the internet (and Medium itself) is full of “tool lists” that are really marketing in disguise — affiliate links, sponsored placements, quiet reciprocity, or someone else’s pipeline pretending to be your best practice.</p><p>This isn’t that.

<h3>Who’s spotting you when you automate</h3><h4>Designing for humans in high-pressure environments.</h4><figure><img alt=""Spotter, in position near lifter on a bench.

They’ve positioned themselves close enough to you, don’t interfere with your lift, and you know they’re watching to step in if needed. This certainty allows you to feel safe. But when you don’t trust your spotter? You pull back because the risk feels too high. It’s no secret that teams wrestle with trust, governance &amp; cross-boundary automation across the industry today.</p><p>What needs to happen when context awareness shifts from humans to systems?</p><h3>Automation doesn’t remove responsibility; it relocates it</h3><p>The benefits of using automation aren’t operational alone; they reshape how teams make decisions as their organization and systems mature. Automation spots trouble 30-40% faster and resolves it, enabling engineers to relocate responsibility with greater confidence. One enterprise study highlights that machine learning-based anomaly detection improved diagnostic accuracy by 25% (<a href=""https://hgbr.org/research_articles/aiops-for-enterprise-integration-evaluating-ml-based-anomaly-detection-and-auto-remediation-on-slas-and-cost/"">HGBR, Oct 2025</a>).

Naturally, questions emerge: <em>Will drift be caught in time? Will rollback behave as expected? Who is notified if something goes wrong? </em>These questions reveal deep issues around accountability, governance, and failure boundaries.</p><p>Engineers rely on mental models to anticipate how systems behave under pressure, but when automation intervenes too early or too late, the models fracture, and psychological safety diminishes. It’s the same feeling as lifting with a spotter who doesn’t know your patterns. They might intervene too late, too early, or at the wrong moment. In automation, the same dynamic surfaces. When mental models diverge, engineers default to manual control, increasing operational effort. This is a common flaw when transparency hasn’t been established.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of rounded weights, stacked in the form of a pyramid."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2iFjq7OipghY1PkD_TMWZw.png"" /><figcaption>The weight stack of safe automation (pyramid) from bottom to top: Preview and impact visibility, Control and rollback clarity, Governance and shared rules, and finally Automation</figcaption></figure><p>Human-Machine teaming research studies consistently report that trust collapses when error boundaries aren’t clear. When automation oversteps human context, or when its error conditions misalign with team mental models, it breaks the contract that makes delegation trustworthy, leading to poor decision-making (Bansal et al. 2019). Context is one of the largest components that fosters trust.</p><p><strong>Psychological safety</strong> in automation requires boundaries. Effective automation communicates what it can and cannot do with accountability structures that mirror how teams operate in the real world. When automation encounters unfamiliar or ambiguous conditions, engineers need immediate clarity: <em>Who gets notified, what rollback options exist, and how do we escalate this issue?</em> If the answers integrate with existing governance practices and team workflows, a partnership with automation forms.</p><figure><img alt=""2x2 Psych safety prioritization map: Predictable but misaligned (upper left), Trusted automation (bottom left), Manual override zone (top right), Aligned but unclear (bottom right)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*t4Lq4hLNUgrckhYNJCuCPA.png"" /><figcaption>Prioritization map helps resolve unclear accountability before addressing issues.</figcaption></figure><p>Within mature IT Service Management (ITSM) practices, <strong>approval gates</strong> act as intentional pauses activated by risk, ensuring safety is supported by judgement that can shift between automation and human decision making. The experience is designed to avoid the reduction of constraints to ‘yes’ or ‘no’ buttons under immense pressure.</p><p>Trust develops over time as automation aligns with organizational and infrastructure patterns as well as team behaviors. As automation demonstrates reliable behavior within learned boundaries, it earns human trust the same way a <strong>great</strong> spotter does, <strong>by observing and responding in a predictive way across repeated interactions.</strong></p><h3>Temporal awareness UX builds the relationship</h3><p>Great automation will not create blocks within your ITSM approval gate with no explanation. Conditional approvals require temporal awareness UX where past incidents inform thresholds, present status signals that establish confidence, and the potential future risk can determine escalation.</p><p>There are novice spotters and good spotters, <strong>but</strong> <strong>a great spotter </strong>understands your environment <strong>and</strong> <strong>anticipates your patterns through temporal awareness.</strong> They’ve watched enough of your sets to notice your patterns. Any spotter can actively watch your bar in<strong> </strong>real-time<strong>, </strong>great spotters notice drifting to the right, see your struggle on rep 3, and give you feedback after your set.</p><p>A commonly overlooked pillar of automation is time.</p><p>Temporal awareness UX is the practice of creating experiences that provide transparency into system states across a timeline.</p><figure><img alt=""Barbell with weights indicating struggle –timeline shows from left to right: Pattern spotting (Rep 1), State transitions (Rep 3), and Historical context and learning (End of set).

Without this, confidence in automation becomes harder to build, and debugging becomes guesswork.</p><p><strong>Real-time status and observability (Present, “Rep 2”):</strong> Like the spotter watching the bar in real time, tools must observe system behavior as it takes place, ready to prevent or alert on imminent failures.</p><p><strong>Trend analysis and prediction (Future): </strong>The elbow flare on Rep 3 anticipates trouble on Rep 5, systems with great visibility detect drift and degradation, preventing chaos before it becomes an incident.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration depicting the Past, present, and future points with great spotters."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7BrJDu4veh8Ce5vIKtEYGA.png"" /><figcaption>Temporal visibility: A lens into what happened, is happening, and what’s next</figcaption></figure><p>Lacking these temporal contexts, approval gates (for example) default to rules that are in stone, and binary decision options; hindering trust instead of reinforcing it.</p><h3>Boundaries and time foster trust</h3><p><strong>Boundaries, not gates, </strong>drive efficiency by creating a support system when pressure peaks. Automation adoption succeeds or fails based on two dimensions:</p><p><strong>– Psychological safety</strong>, requiring clear boundaries. Like a trusted spotter, automation must communicate what it will or won’t do, when it’ll intervene, and how teams can escalate when something goes wrong. <br />– <strong>Temporal awareness</strong>, requiring visibility across time. Engineers need to understand what happened (learn from incidents), what’s happening (for awareness), and what will happen (for preventing failures).</p><p>Without these interdependent dimensions, teams operate blindly, unable to trust systems they can’t predict or observe. Safe automation requires a spotter who remembers, observes, and anticipates.</p><p>Good automation is functional. <strong>Great automation employs these spotter behaviors by design, </strong>making safety and timing intelligible for humans, helping teams push their limits, knowing their partner is watching.</p><p><em>Over the past decade, I’ve focused on enhancing the developer product experience within multi-disciplinary teams.

<h4>I treated my board game like a product and used UX practices to improve its UI—simplifying the game and maxing the fun.</h4><p>As a User Experience (UX) professional, it’s hard to ignore the correlation between UX and board game design. From defining personas, to prototyping and usability testing, to content hierarchy… The parallels are incredible and if you’re a board game designer, you’re likely already doing them, perhaps without knowing it.</p><p>The benefits of applying UX design to board game design only starts here (during the initial design phase). But UX principles are beneficial from start to finish. For example, heuristics can be used to <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-heuristics-board-games/"">audit and improve</a> final UI elements. <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/board-game-ux-help-and-documentation-74335da5ce20"">Information Architecture principles</a> can be used in component design and rulebook creation. And <a href=""https://mindclashgames.com/board-game-iconography-how-smart-symbols-enhance-ux-and-playability/"">leveraging common iconography</a> will ensure players can easily understand intent.</p><p>Here are the key takeaways that you should consider when designing your board game (and will be explored below):</p><ul><li>UX practices will improve your board game.</li><li>You must clearly identify who your game is for, connect with them, and listen to them, in order to improve.</li><li>Having an open mind is critical to the design process.</li><li>Your main job is to steer the ship and bring your vision to life. You need to decide what’s best for your game.</li></ul><p>Before we go any further, let’s all speak the same language. Each time you play a game-in-progress, it’s called a playtest. I have now had many playtests, gotten so much invaluable feedback, and played my game with dozens of people. I sincerely want to thank everyone who have participated in the process for their time and opinion. I would not be where I am today without them.</p><p>WARNING: This is a <strong>deep dive</strong> into the evolution of a single component of a larger board game. A card. This card has gone through roughly 10 iterations, but I’ll focus on 3 critical checkpoints, outlining the changes, what drove those changes, and the learnings along the way. There is <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/board-game-ux-help-and-documentation-74335da5ce20"">definitely a bit of an art</a> to designing the best card design.</p><p>At this point I’ve lost count of how many times I have created what I thought was the “final design” (ok not really, but you get the point). Just like a digital product, a board game is never truly done, until it’s published, but revisions can always come later..</p><p>For now, let’s dive in. Meet Mort.</p><figure><img alt=""An illustration of a character named Mort."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*d5fl77SOt8bg5L_sb-5YUQ.png"" /><figcaption>This was Mort. He’s now dead.</figcaption></figure><p>Now say goodbye. Great Uncle Mort is dead. This should be a solemn occasion, but it’s not.<br />Mort’s house is full of priceless artifacts, questionable heirlooms, and deeply personal stuff that no one will admit to wanting. As his “closest” relatives, you have gathered for the reading of the Will, each of you hoping to walk away with more than your fair share.</p><p>And here’s one of the “questionable heirlooms”, v1 of the item.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a board game card. It has a Taxidermy Ferret. The card also features a suit and value (4 egg), a power (Discard 1 card) and two win condition."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/610/1*STaUU3z1JyiVKkeJcncl2g.png"" /><figcaption>v1 Taxidermy Ferret</figcaption></figure><p>The card has 4 main areas, each trying to communicate something different:</p><figure><img alt=""This shows a breakdown of the 3 card components (suit and value, the flavour text and photo, and the power)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*EV02h1V7EreSixdI77JJpA.png"" /><figcaption>Left: Value and Suit.

Right: Top box (black arrow) and bottom box (white arrow)</figcaption></figure><p>That last features requires a little explanation. I love interesting mechanics. I came across this game where the back of the draw deck influenced the flipped card’s impact, so I built this into my game. It was meant to work that when the Taxidermy Ferret is drawn and placed next to the draw deck, it may be won in one of 2 possible ways:</p><ol><li>If the card back of the draw deck has a <strong>black</strong> spade: The Taxidermy Ferret may be won with the highest Painting item (the picture icon).</li><li>If the card back of the draw deck has a <strong>white</strong> spade: The Taxidermy Ferret may be won with the highest Sculpture item (the face icon).</li></ol><p>That’s a lot of heavy lifting for one card. And a lot of things that are relevant based on where the card lives (in your hand vs on the table).</p><p>I had many playtests, spoke to many people. Here’s a snippet of feedback that I heard:</p><ul><li>“My favourite part of the game is the story and all the quirky items!“</li><li>“I want more control over how a card on the table is won”</li><li>“The cards are very ‘busy’”</li><li>“I don’t love the ‘black vs white’ language”</li><li>“The cards are too confusing, and the game is not complex enough for me”</li></ul><p>UX Translation:</p><ul><li>I needed to reduce the cognitive load of the cards.</li><li>I should consider designing separate UIs for some of these features.</li><li>I needed to leverage the Design Process Model to understand, iterate and address the feedback.</li></ul><p>One painful adjustment is that I needed to “kill my first darling”: The back of the deck influences the flipped card. It wasn’t working. I decided to introduce a mechanism where players would vote using their cards instead of relying on the back of the deck.</p><p>Let’s look at v2, the next major iteration:</p><figure><img alt=""v2 of the same Ferret card with visual improvements, and also additional complications shown in the next series of photos."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/610/1*5RLyBXpLHJ5WQuGgr1YQGA.png"" /><figcaption>v2 Taxidermy Ferret</figcaption></figure><p>I made a mistake.

But I also took the opportunity to add more of what players were asking for, story…</p><figure><img alt=""Some added complexities were added to the card based on feedback.

It was now part murder mystery, part escape game, and I loved the “progress”.</p><p>5. Voting: Players could now vote Red or Gold to decide the win condition of a card on the table.</p><p>I thought the cards were now amazing. They gave players the ability to vote on win condition. The value and suit were together and easier to see. The win conditions were together at the bottom and colour-matched the voting. AND there was a super cool escape room murder mystery.</p><p>I thought I had addressed all of the feedback and focused on more of what people wanted, more story, less card confusion, more game complexity, no “black/white” battle… but I ignored the most critical feedback, the cards are too busy.</p><p>Now I was hearing feedback like:</p><ul><li>“I find the cards confusing.”</li><li>“There’s a lot on the cards that doesn’t matter right now.”</li><li>“So you can only solve the mystery once?” (Uhhh yes, it’s an escape room!)</li><li>“The tokens (formerly ‘powers’) are so much fun!”</li></ul><p>I took a step back to think about what the game was trying to be. Was the game a way for me to make people think I was smart, or was it trying to make players “feel” like they were bickering greedy relatives at a Will reading (and having fun doing so). Obviously I was aiming for the latter.</p><p>I also decided to take a moment and consider who this game was for: Casual and hobby gamers looking for a palate cleanser between rounds of Wingspan, or Ark Nova. As such, it needed to be less complex, and more focused on the “fun” part. I needed to take another look at the cards, trying to focus more on what the players I was targetting wanted, and MUCH less of what they didn’t want.</p><p>UX Translation:</p><ul><li>I needed to define my Personas and get into their mindset, and only build for them.</li><li>I needed more usability testing.</li><li>I needed to ensure my content hierarchy matched my user’s goals and the context in which they were using my cards.</li><li>My SMEs had influenced too much feature creep.</li><li>I needed to reduce cognitive load of the cards. For real this time.</li><li>I needed to consider designing <em>even more</em> separate UIs for some of these features.</li></ul><p>Also worth noting, I decided that I needed to “kill my second darling”. The murder mystery escape game. I loved it. But it was too much, and more importantly, it was not for my target audience. Maybe I’ll use it in a future game.</p><p>Here’s v3.</p><figure><img alt=""v3 of the Ferret card has been largely simplified.

And even better, it totally “fit” into the game and worked as I had originally envisioned. I was very happy.</p><p>This also gave me the ability to add more story into the game (what people wanted), introduced Treasures that the players could chase, and allowed me to overhaul the rules of the game to make it feel more like a greedy Will reading, complete with an embezzling Executor! Everything just clicked and the game felt much more fun &amp; engaging, felt like a bunch of greedy relatives bickering, and most importantly, was far less confusing.</p><p>Overall, taking a <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/board-game-ux-minimalist-design-ab812ee5412d"">minimalist design approach to the card</a> (instead of trying to have one card to more work than it should) made the card easier to understand, added more space for thematic fun, and improved the game overall.</p><p>I need to do even more playtesting, but based on the feedback I’ve already heard from this newest version, I believe the cards (at least) are “ready”. Over this journey the most critical takeaways were:</p><ul><li>You must clearly identify who your game is for and build for them.</li><li>Your game will only improve if you remain open to feedback (even if it means shelving something you really like – it can always come back, in this game or the next one)</li><li>Stay focused on your vision – just because ideas are shared, doesn’t mean implementing them will make your game better. It’s your game, you decide.</li></ul><p>If you are curious to what attending the Will reading and is like, the game draws inspirations from <a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/115/im-the-boss"">I’m the boss</a>, <a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172/for-sale"">For Sale</a>, and <a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/220/high-society"">High Society</a>.</p><p>As you can see, board game design and UX go hand in hand. Designing for your audience is like Persona creation. Playtesting is like usability testing. The playtesting mindset is the Design Process Model, expanding and contracting as you identify and work to resolve negative feedback. Having a deep background in User Experience has helped greatly, and sped up my game design process. It’s been 2 months since Great Uncle Mort is Dead was born, and I think I’m ready to start pitching it to publishers. I would not be here today without both my obsession with board games, and my passion for User Experience.</p><p>If you’ve made it this far and would like to talk about board game design, or user experience, let’s connect.</p><p>All cards were designed by me and include iconography from NounProject, whereas the illustrations of the Taxidermy Ferret, Mort, the scrolls, and “Mona Lisa” were AI generated as placeholders. If and when this game is published they will likely be replaced, by the publisher.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=97bfcdb1d581"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/ux-in-board-game-design-97bfcdb1d581"">UX in board game design</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>What actually goes into a good prompt, and why most advice skips this</h4><figure><img alt=""Illustration of hands holding binoculars with eyes, looking at a floating photo of a person."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RNqin4edZ02x53nGTpedjw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>If you’re trying to learn how to write good Figma Make prompts, you’ve probably hit the same wall I did.</p><p>Most advice stays abstract.<br /><em>Be clear. Add context. Explain intent.</em></p><p>None of that helps when you’re staring at an empty prompt box wondering what actually needs to go in there.</p><p>What’s missing in the industry right now isn’t more frameworks. It’s <strong>real examples</strong>. <em>Full prompts.</em> End-to-end inputs you can actually read and learn from.</p><p>By the end of this post, you should have a clearer sense of what actually belongs in a Figma Make prompt, based on <strong>real inputs that already work</strong>.</p><p>Instead of inventing yet another framework, I looked at what already exists. I studied real inputs, tested them, and compared the results. This post documents that process using <strong>real prompts, real tradeoffs, and real constraints</strong>.</p><p>If you’re new to Figma Make, this will help you get unstuck. If you’ve already used it, this will help you waste fewer prompts.</p><h3>TL;DR</h3><p>Most Figma Make advice is vague. It tells you to <em>“add context”</em> without showing what a good prompt actually looks like.</p><p>This post breaks down <strong>three real approaches designers are already using</strong> to write Figma Make prompts:</p><ul><li>using a PRD as the prompt</li><li>translating loose inputs into Make-ready instructions</li><li>pressure-testing intent with a simple checklist</li></ul><p>Instead of frameworks, this post shows <strong>full prompts end to end</strong>, including the <em>tradeoffs, time cost, and limitations</em> that come with them. The goal isn’t better prompts for their own sake. It’s <strong>fewer reruns, clearer intent, and workflows that still hold up</strong> as these tools become more constrained and more expensive.</p><p>If you only read one section, read <em>Applying this in practice</em>.</p><h3>Why focus on prompts at all?</h3><p>There are a lot of <a href=""https://youtu.be/9Y2Yz-ir3JM?si=OdP19cX5G_KxycwT"">ways to use Figma Make</a>. You can begin with simple inputs like images or existing files, then move into more advanced options such as the Point-and-Edit tool, connecting a library (organization and enterprise plans only), or editing code.</p><p>This post focuses on <strong>prompt writing</strong> because it offers the most leverage. From a blank canvas, you can create something surprisingly robust, including a <strong>working prototype</strong>. The ability to <em>build from scratch, clearly and intentionally</em>, is going to be in high demand.</p><h3>Three approaches worth studying</h3><p>Each of these comes from a respected voice in the industry and reflects a <strong>real way people are already working with Figma Make</strong>. I’m using them as concrete examples to break down what goes into an effective prompt, then translating those lessons into a <strong>real, actionable prompt</strong> you can study and edit yourself.</p><figure><img alt=""E-commerce cart page prototype generated from a PRD-based Figma Make prompt"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jveEH8DMXsq1KraXCEr0eQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>E-commerce cart prototype generated from a PRD-based Figma Make prompt</figcaption></figure><h3>1. Product requirements document (PRD)</h3><p>This example comes from a <a href=""https://youtu.be/EUPbdk972JI?si=xojfXzYqwVfEFNbe""><strong>YouTube video</strong></a><strong> by Jesse Showalter</strong> of Design Champs and uses a PRD as the prompt itself.</p><p>A PRD, or <strong>product requirements document</strong>, is a written description of what you’re trying to build. It lays out what the screen does, how it behaves, the rough layout, key states, and constraints like responsiveness or accessibility. It’s not a visual artifact. It’s a <em>thinking artifact</em>.</p><p>What makes this example valuable isn’t just the output. It’s the <strong>input</strong>.</p><p>The video doesn’t share the <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1diXC36YL9u1wd2hw40oi4N98gvp5xnjaUe7nOomr_EU/edit?usp=sharing""><strong>full prompt text</strong></a>, but I tracked it down and included it so you can read it end to end. Being able to see the entire prompt makes it much easier to understand <em>why</em> the result works and what kind of detail actually carries weight.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/664cd3ac21e30bb8ce1528cf52f9a374/href"">https://medium.com/media/664cd3ac21e30bb8ce1528cf52f9a374/href</a><p>When I reused that same prompt, it produced a solid, <a href=""https://legal-mosaic-22940652.figma.site""><strong>interactive prototype</strong></a> for a clothing store experience that I could copy back into Figma and continue iterating on. That’s what made the PRD powerful. <strong>It could be reused, and it produced consistent results.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Color palette prototype created from a prompt generated by the Make Prompt Assistant (custom GPT)."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FSXsKlc4qrviP2N1CmxwnQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Color palette prototype created from a prompt generated by the Make Prompt Assistant (custom GPT).</figcaption></figure><h3>2. Make Prompt Assistant</h3><p>The <strong>Make Prompt Assistant</strong> is a <strong>custom GPT available in ChatGPT</strong>, created by <strong>Greg Huntoon</strong>, a Design Manager at Figma.</p><p>What makes this approach useful is how quickly it gets you unstuck. You can start with something loose, like <em>“create a website inspired by coolors.co,”</em> and it will generate a <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wBUKRv7qUtIL2FlhWJjFjHLEgR-xEsVylHdKpFp3itA/edit?usp=sharing""><strong>structured prompt</strong></a> you can hand directly to Figma Make.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/35c2b2c7e3de8eef91a455841b8f49d2/href"">https://medium.com/media/35c2b2c7e3de8eef91a455841b8f49d2/href</a><p>This approach isn’t as robust as writing a prompt from scratch. You give up some flexibility because you’re not explicitly defining every decision. The assistant fills in gaps for you, which means <strong>some intent is inferred rather than specified</strong>.</p><p>The resulting prototype is a <em>solid starting point</em>. It provides structure and momentum, but it still needs refinement. That’s expected. This works best as a <strong>first pass</strong>, not a single, fully defined prompt.</p><p><strong>Core prompt structure</strong>:</p><ul><li>Task: what to build or change</li><li>Context: where it lives in the product</li><li>Elements: literal UI components</li><li>Behavior: interactions, states, logic</li><li>Constraints: device, layout, rules</li></ul><h3>3. TOKEN framework</h3><p>The <a href=""https://medium.com/ux-planet/a-practical-prompting-guide-for-figma-make-eb72f78ff1ce""><strong>TOKEN framework</strong></a> comes from <strong>Nick Babich</strong>, Product Designer and Editor-in-Chief of <strong>UX Planet</strong>, and was originally published on Medium.</p><p>TOKEN is the most explicit about structure. Rather than telling you to <em>“be clear,”</em> it defines what clarity actually means by naming the categories prompts often miss.</p><p>It doesn’t guarantee a good result, but it <strong>significantly reduces the chance that something important is missing</strong> from the first prompt.</p><p>I don’t think of TOKEN as a rigid script. I use it as a <em>pressure check</em> before handing control over to Make.</p><p>TOKEN stands for:</p><ul><li>Task: what exactly do you want the AI to do</li><li>Output: what should the final result look like</li><li>Key design elements: what must be included</li><li>Expected behaviors: how it responds to interaction</li><li>Notable constraints: platform, accessibility, brand, or technical rules</li></ul><h3>What these approaches have in common</h3><p>All three approaches required knowing what you wanted to <strong>build</strong> and having a clear sense of how it should function, what it should look like, and whether there were existing examples to pull from.</p><p>None of them worked well without that clarity up front. Before Make could produce anything useful, the <strong>decisions were already in place</strong>.</p><p>Across all three, prompts improved once these basics were settled:</p><ul><li>what was being built</li><li>what it was for</li><li>how it should behave</li><li>which constraints mattered</li></ul><p>When those decisions weren’t settled, prompts became harder to write and outputs became less predictable. Prompting didn’t resolve that uncertainty. <em>It surfaced it.</em></p><h3>How they differ in structure and intent</h3><p>Where these approaches differ is <strong>how and when those decisions get made</strong>.</p><p>Using a PRD pushes nearly all of the decision-making up front. You define intent explicitly, which gives you the most control and makes it possible for a single prompt to carry a lot of weight. The tradeoff is effort. Writing that level of clarity takes time.</p><p>The Make Prompt Assistant shifts some of that work to the tool. It’s useful when you have a loose idea or reference and want to get moving quickly, but some intent is inferred rather than specified. Refinement happens through iteration rather than a single, fully defined prompt.</p><p>TOKEN doesn’t create intent at all. It acts as a checkpoint. It’s most useful right before you run a prompt, when you want to verify that nothing important has been missed.</p><p>Once a design already exists, <strong>short, targeted prompts tend to outperform any framework</strong>. One change. One target.</p><figure><img alt=""Prototype created by applying a PRD-inspired prompt shaped by the techniques explored in this article."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KOEOPQIVS2zeUMGanM8kuQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Prototype created by applying a PRD-inspired prompt shaped by the techniques explored in this article.</figcaption></figure><h3>Applying this in practice</h3><p>After studying these approaches, I applied them to a real use case to see what actually held up.</p><p>I used a marketplace browsing experience similar to Etsy because it reflects the kind of work many designers deal with day to day. Search, filters, product grids, seller identity, favorites, responsive behavior, and accessibility are all common requirements on real product teams. This wasn’t a demo scenario. It was something I could realistically see a team needing to prototype.</p><p>I set one constraint up front: <strong>one prompt, no edits</strong>.</p><p>The goal wasn’t to keep nudging Make until it behaved. It was to push as much decision-making as possible into the prompt itself and see whether a single input could produce a functional result without follow-up corrections. The prototype mattered, but <strong>the real focus was the prompt</strong>.</p><p>For comparison, a previous <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/i-built-a-game-app-in-figma-make-41c54b89fd7f"">Figma Make game app</a> project I built completely from scratch took around <strong>680 prompts over four days</strong>. This experiment took closer to <strong>40 prompts and about eight hours</strong>. The difference wasn’t UI complexity. It was <strong>how much structure existed before Make ever ran</strong>.</p><p>Getting to a <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LuUpmb4H52zfvORxAH2AQ8fLrxyncsFR2fPT1O-orT8/edit?usp=sharing""><strong>single prompt</strong></a> that could generate a fully functioning prototype without edits was time-consuming. Each prompt run took roughly <strong>10 to 15 minutes</strong>, and as the prompt grew longer, Make would sometimes skip over details that were already written. That meant certain requirements had to be reinforced more than once.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/7a31f61c7fa063786f6175e058325526/href"">https://medium.com/media/7a31f61c7fa063786f6175e058325526/href</a><p>In practice, those gaps were easy to fix by asking Make to review the prompt again and adjust specific areas. But that wasn’t the experiment. The experiment was to see <strong>how far a one-pass prompt could realistically go on its own</strong>.</p><p><em>I didn’t fully reach that goal.</em></p><p>In some runs, the prompt produced exactly what I asked for. In others, small but important things broke or behaved inconsistently. Filters didn’t respond as expected. Menu states worked in one run and failed in another. Hover text occasionally rendered unreadable. None of these issues were hard to fix with additional prompting, but needing to fix them at all was the point. <strong>The variability mattered</strong>.</p><p>Based on this work, I don’t think Figma Make is consistently there yet. It’s close, but <strong>not reliable enough to guarantee that outcome every time</strong>.</p><p>To be honest, this was frustrating. <strong>Figma Make is an innovative tool</strong> and a clear signal of where design workflows are headed, but it still feels closer to a beta product than a finished one. It’s powerful for prototyping and exploration, but there’s work left to be done, especially as it moves toward a <a href=""https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/33459875669015-How-AI-credits-work""><strong>credit-based model</strong></a>. Being charged for prompts that <strong>fail, drift, or ignore requirements</strong> is a real concern.</p><p>At the same time, I don’t think this is a static system. Figma has a strong track record of iterating quickly, and I expect many of these rough edges to improve as Make matures. Even so, the direction is clear. <strong>Prompting is becoming part of day-to-day design work</strong>, and cost will increasingly be tied to <strong>how clearly intent is defined up front</strong>.</p><p>That’s why <strong>understanding how to write clear, effective prompts matters now</strong>. This isn’t about perfection. It’s about being prepared for how design workflows are changing and what that change will cost.</p><p>I wrote this because I couldn’t find the article I wanted when I started. One that showed <em>real prompts, real tradeoffs, and real constraints</em>.</p><p>If this helps you approach prompting with more confidence and intention, it did its job.</p><h3>References</h3><ul><li>Showalter, Jesse. <em>Using Figma Make to Go From Nothing to Interactive Prototypes</em>.

<h4>A story from the field: the day safeguarding became real</h4><figure><img alt=""Laptop, phone and book chained together, symbolising safeguarding and data security in user research fieldwork. Source: Pexels."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pt1NxJUSAWyMb06YrmA_Zg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Laptop, phone and book chained together, symbolising safeguarding and data security in user research fieldwork. Source: Pexels.</figcaption></figure><p>During a discovery project, I was visiting education settings across England to run in‑person research. That meant working inside real-world constraints: safeguarding processes, visitor protocols, staff availability, young people moving through corridors, rooms that suddenly became unavailable, and the constant awareness that you’re a guest in someone else’s environment.</p><p>At one site, we were told (almost casually) that more than half the staff were off sick with COVID, and another bug was doing the rounds. The cherry on top was that we were crammed into a small basement room that was colder than the rest of the building, so no ventilation, and a very high chance of catching whatever was circulating.</p><p>Two days later, I was ill. I stayed ill for weeks. I couldn’t take sick leave due to tight deadlines and stakeholders picking on any leave taken as “delaying the project”.</p><p>That was my reminder that:</p><blockquote>Safeguarding isn’t only about what happens <strong>in</strong> the session. It’s also about what happens <strong>around</strong> the session: infection risk, travel load, lone working, fatigue, access, and the logistics nobody puts on the Gantt chart, including allowance for sick leave.</blockquote><p>And if you think that’s “just wellbeing” …well, it isn’t. It’s research quality. When researchers are depleted, rushed, anxious about getting to the next site, or taking avoidable health risks, the work gets worse. Decision-making gets shakier, debriefs get skipped, boundaries blur, and the conditions for ethical, high-quality research quietly erode.</p><p>The safeguarding plan template I share with you (at the end of this article) is informed by what I now call “interesting” field notes (though at the time, they were mildly psychosis‑inducing events!). I’m sharing 7 field notes to set the stage for why (and I cannot emphasise this enough) a safeguarding plan really matters.</p><h4>Field note #1: the invisible entrance</h4><p>On one visit, I arrived at what looked like a massive establishment, but couldn’t find the entrance. Construction work, temporary buildings, and exactly zero signposting added to the pain. I spent the first 15 minutes convincing myself I’d come to the wrong place, while my Uber driver (now a distant memory) had left me in what felt like a no-man’s-land.</p><p>I rechecked Google Maps like 50 times, reread my emails and tried contacting the reception by calling but no luck.</p><p>Eventually, a stranger appeared, also going to the same place, pointed me to the entrance like a human “you are here” sign. It was like going through a maze!</p><p>No one had done anything malicious in this case. I’d sent confirmation emails. They’d replied. We’d all behaved like professionals. But nobody had thought to say:</p><blockquote>“Entrance is currently around the back, follow the temporary fencing and come through the metal gates where all the clinical waste bins are lined up, and ignore the sign that lies.”</blockquote><p>It wasn’t their “fault”. It was the assumption that got me. I did not treat basic navigation and access as part of safeguarding. The fix, is boring and brilliant:</p><blockquote>Ask for <strong>photos of the entrance</strong>, a <strong>named contact with a mobile number</strong>, and a plan for what happens if you can’t get in within 10 minutes.</blockquote><figure><img alt=""Building entrance hidden behind construction work (scaffolding) and confusing signage.

Source: Pexels.</figcaption></figure><h4>Field note #2: the lone working</h4><p>When I was a PhD researcher, my office was in what was called “the Pink Building.” A large, light‑pink shed on campus. It had the architectural charm of a storage unit and the safety profile of, let’s say, “optimistic”.</p><p>One evening, we were preparing for a large-scale randomised controlled trial. We were printing and packing hundreds of consent forms, participant information sheets, and supporting documentation (ethical approval, what you need to know etc.). The kind of admin tasks that convinces you that your PhD is mainly an advanced qualification in stapling and packing envelopes.</p><p>Due to the looming deadline, I stayed late. A few others stayed late too.</p><p>At some point, without noticing, I became the last person in the building. And for some reason the main door would not open. I was stuck, and it was way past lone‑working hours. There were no CCTV cameras inside the building, and the dread of my supervisor finding out (and then them getting in trouble) was doing a lovely little duet with my panic response.</p><p>I called a friend who lived nearby. Luckily, they were home and they came and got me out.</p><p>Weeks later, I found out a different office in that same building had caught fire because a student smoked inside a wooden shed and left a still‑lit cigarette butt in a bin full of paper. The fire alarm did its job (thankfully). However, the final-year PhD student’s work couldn’t be rescued.</p><p>I’m sharing this because it’s the most predictable safeguarding lesson in academia (and beyond):</p><blockquote>Lone working isn’t a badge of honour. It’s a risk that needs a plan.</blockquote><h4>Field note #3: the re‑traumatisation</h4><p>Now for the one that still makes my eye twitch.</p><p>There was an opening event for a trial involving eating disorders. An influencer with lived experience was invited (paid to attend by public funding!). A media presence was expected. The senior investigator bragged about having “useful connections” in high places (because nothing says “scientific rigour” like name‑dropping your minister cousin).</p><p>Thank goodness the broadcaster didn’t show up, and neither did the “very important cousin”.</p><p>But what did happen was worse in a quieter way: there were clearly people in the room being impacted by the choices made around food, messaging, and the theatre of it all. It was a masterclass in how a team can be so focused on “PR” that they lose sight of basic emotional safety.</p><p>Putting large quantities of food and drinks in front of people (including the influencer herself) was not thoughtful. It was triggering for many because they were there due to lived experience of battling severe eating disorders that included <strong>anorexia, bulimia and so on</strong>… and then you have staff enthusiastically eating and drinking through it all.</p><p>That experience sharpened a point I now say out loud in project kick-offs:</p><blockquote>You can have all the ethics paperwork in the world. If your team culture treats re‑traumatisation as an abstract risk rather than a real human outcome, you don’t have safeguarding, you have compliance cosplay.</blockquote><p>And if the most senior person is the risk, you need a pre-agreed speak‑up route (not just “be brave”). A stop rule. A named escalation contact outside the immediate hierarchy, and a culture where safeguards are rehearsed, not improvised. In academia, the ethics board that approved the study is one route of escalation.</p><figure><img alt=""Measuring tape wrapped around an apple symbolising diet and eating disorders.

Everything looked “approved” on paper. Then I arrived, and suddenly I had no access. Nobody would speak to me and I was told to wait in reception for hours. Doors that should have opened didn’t. The relationship between the university and the partner organisation had fractured at a senior level, and I’d been left out of the loop.</p><p>So there I was with wasted travel cost, time, energy, preparation and a hard stop. This is safeguarding too.</p><blockquote>Because safeguarding is also about protecting the <strong>work</strong> and the <strong>researcher</strong>. If a breakdown in institutional comms can strand you physically, professionally, and emotionally (and sometimes financially), then it needs to sit in the risk register like any other operational risk.</blockquote><p>The question we rarely ask is who covers what? Before I now travel for fieldwork, I confirm insurance/indemnity and cancellation rules:</p><ul><li>who covers travel costs if access collapses,</li><li>whether professional indemnity/public liability applies (especially if contracting), and</li><li>who has authority to pause/stop fieldwork if safety conditions change.</li></ul><h4>Field note #5: families as a risk variable</h4><p>In social care settings, there’s another layer that rarely makes it into tidy templates:</p><blockquote>Families can be protective and brilliant, and they can also be chaotic, accusatory, and sometimes actively harmful.</blockquote><p>During my time working in social care and in an NHS rehab service, I’ve seen families raise serious concerns that were absolutely legitimate and needed action.</p><p>I’ve also seen families create issues where there were none. And I’ve seen situations where family members were taking money from someone in care, then implying it was the setting’s fault or that the staff “didn’t do their job properly” and attempting to escalate formally.</p><p>As researchers, we don’t prosecute. But we do need to plan for:</p><ul><li>third‑party risk,</li><li>allegations and counter‑allegations,</li><li>reputational volatility,</li><li>and the possibility that “what’s true” is not always clear in the moment.</li></ul><h4>Field note #6: when the VPN and firewall are so safe they break the research</h4><p>In one organisation, we assumed the laptops provided would seamlessly connect to Wi‑Fi on sites being visited. Trust me when I say: they did not. The firewall and VPN were so secure that even the host IT team couldn’t troubleshoot the connection.</p><p>The result was that MS Teams wouldn’t run, recording didn’t work, and there was no built‑in audio recording on the laptop. I also didn’t have a dedicated work mobile, so using my personal phone to capture audio would have breached policy.</p><p>We defaulted to note-taking, but even that became an issue because uploads to the analysis tool kept failing. We ended up with an incomplete dataset and analysis that relied far too much on memory.</p><p>Safeguarding lesson here is that you need a pre‑agreed offline plan (confirming Wi‑Fi access arrangements and device/VPN constraints in advance of the visit, approved recording routes, secure note templates, and a contingency for when tech fails), especially in high-stakes/high-security settings.</p><p>Another important thing to note is that in high-security settings like prisons, secure mental health hospitals, and immigration environments, safeguarding escalates because power imbalance is built into the setting. Recording may be prohibited altogether, device access may be restricted or denied, staff may be present in the session impacting what is said and shared, and “voluntary participation” can be complicated. For such settings, your safeguards need to be even more robust and explicit like having a paired working and no lone-working at all.</p><h4>Field note #7: not everyone is willing to participate</h4><p>One of the biggest lessons I learned is that not everyone will participate, even when your intentions are good and your paperwork is flawless. In some communities, trust is not easy to earn.</p><p>I’ve turned up at settings where I simply couldn’t access the voices I came to hear. Some communities have rational reasons for being cautious: history, extraction, misrepresentation, and previous “research” that didn’t translate into change.</p><p>This taught me that refusal is data too, not a failure. Safeguarding here means:</p><blockquote>Designing for cultural safety and voluntariness which may look like working through trusted community connectors, using culturally appropriate facilitators where needed, offering different modes of participation, and being explicit that saying “no” to participation has no consequences.</blockquote><figure><img alt=""Human holding a banner saying ‘No’ against a yellow background.

They’re pragmatic. They improve safety, choice, and trust, which tends to improve the quality of what people are able (and willing) to share.</p><p>In research terms, a trauma‑informed lens pushes you to design sessions where participants:</p><ul><li>know what’s coming,</li><li>have meaningful control,</li><li>can opt out without penalty,</li><li>and aren’t pushed into disclosure “for the sake of insight”.</li></ul><p>It also forces a professional acknowledgement that researchers can be impacted too by vicarious trauma, fatigue, stress, and the physical reality of operating in high‑pressure systems.</p><h4>2) Factoring in incentives (as a safeguarding decision, not just admin)</h4><p><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9631331/"">Incentives can reduce barriers to participation</a>, but they can also create pressure, bias, or risk.</p><p>I treat incentives as part of safeguarding:</p><ul><li>It must never be framed as “payment for disclosure”.</li><li>It should not be conditional on answering every question or completing the session fully (especially in the digital world where 45 minutes into a 60 minute session, the connection breaks, or a participant faces issues when re-joining the session).</li><li>It must be safe and discreet to deliver (cash can create risk; digital delivery can create privacy issues where emails, bank account details are shared).</li><li>It <a href=""https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/research-and-innovation/research/Assets/Documents/PDF/ethics-incentives-reimbursement-etc-v5.pdf"">should be equitable</a>: if we pay for time, we should consider expenses and participation costs (travel, childcare, food etc.).</li></ul><p>And yes, incentives can attract misrepresentation. People may tell you what they think gets them “into the study”, or what they think will please you. That’s not a reason to remove incentives; it’s a reason to:</p><ul><li>design screening carefully and thoughtfully,</li><li>avoid recruitment through coercive gatekeepers,</li><li>and be clear that incentives are not linked to “performing” as a good participant.</li></ul><h4>3) Consent and assent (done properly, not performatively)</h4><p>This is the part that matters most, especially when vulnerable people are involved.</p><p><a href=""https://www.hra.nhs.uk/planning-and-improving-research/best-practice/informing-participants-and-seeking-consent""><strong>Consent</strong></a><strong> for adults with capacity</strong> must be informed, freely given, specific, and ongoing (reconfirm at key moments).</p><p><strong>Children: </strong><a href=""https://www.hra-decisiontools.org.uk/consent/principles-children.html#:~:text=Consent%20is%20a%20legally%20defined,their%20capacity%20when%20seeking%20assent.""><strong>consent + assent</strong></a></p><ul><li>Parental/guardian consent may be required (depending on policy and age).</li><li>Child assent should still be sought even when an adult has consented on their behalf.</li></ul><p>Assent is not a tick-box. It’s the child’s affirmative agreement, expressed in age-appropriate ways. And here’s what it may look like:</p><ul><li>If the child does not want to take part, verbally or non‑verbally, we stop.</li><li>If the child wants to stop partway through, we stop.</li><li>If the child wants to skip a question, we skip it.</li></ul><p>No negotiation. No persuasion. No “just one more question.”</p><p><strong>Vulnerable adults/adults who may lack capacity: </strong><a href=""https://www.cqc.org.uk/guidance-regulation/providers/regulations-service-providers-and-managers/health-social-care-act/regulation-11""><strong>supported decision‑making + assent</strong></a></p><ul><li>Use supported decision-making (plain language, time, breaks, visuals, accessible formats).</li><li>Check understanding by asking them to explain back (in their own words) what will happen, what will be recorded, and that they can stop.</li></ul><p>If a person cannot understand/retain/weigh the information or communicate a decision even with support:</p><ul><li>you cannot rely on their consent alone,</li><li>you may need a legally authorised representative process (depending on jurisdiction/policy),</li><li>and you should still seek the person’s assent and monitor for distress or dissent.</li></ul><p>And again: if they show they don’t want to continue, we stop.</p><p><strong>Gatekeepers (who protect voluntariness)</strong><br />Teachers, carers, clinicians, managers, and yes, prison staff, can enable access and unintentionally pressure participation. Build in:</p><ul><li>a private opt‑out route,</li><li>clear “no consequence” language,</li><li>and a cooling-off window where appropriate.</li></ul><h3>5 things I now do before I enter any setting (and why)</h3><p>These are the “unsexy” steps that make fieldwork safer, and prevent heroics from becoming the plan:</p><h4>1) Map safeguarding on both sides (and confirm clearance)</h4><ul><li>Identify the host setting’s safeguarding lead and read their safeguarding policy before you arrive.</li><li>Identify your organisation’s safeguarding lead and escalation route.</li><li>Make sure both ends know how to reach each other quickly.</li><li>Confirm clearance requirements early (e.g., enhanced DBS, prison/security vetting, NHS site rules). If clearance won’t land in time: pivot method early.</li></ul><h4>2) Build a fieldwork tracker (treat it like an asset, not admin)</h4><p>Document:</p><ul><li>where you’re going (exact building location),</li><li>photos of the entrance if it’s a complex site,</li><li>who you’re meeting (names where appropriate, roles, agreed contact details),</li><li>a named contact with a mobile number,</li><li>timings, check‑in/out times, contingency routes,</li><li>language requirements (do participants communicate in English; do you need an interpreter).</li><li>Inform the setting that you’ll need to access their network and ask for WiFi and device connectivity early on so you avoid delays on the day.</li><li>Create a separate tracker for your participants where you use participant IDs but keep participant contact details separate.</li><li>Have a tracker for research work where you keep a record of what was recorded, with whom, who conducted the session, who took notes, who observed, what supplementary material was provided, if you upload the material and notes etc. For online research, you can adapt this tracker (links, time zones, backup numbers, “what if the platform fails”).</li><li>For data security, upload to secure storage promptly, and don’t rely on “I’ll sort it later” when you’re travelling.</li></ul><h4>3) Treat public health as part of safeguarding (post‑COVID reality)</h4><p>Before in‑person work:</p><ul><li>ask the site about outbreaks or visitor restrictions,</li><li>confirm PPE expectations (even if “optional”),</li><li>decide in advance what triggers a reschedule or a switch to remote.</li></ul><h4>4) Plan reset capacity like it’s a delivery constraint (because it is)</h4><ul><li>Cap the number of intensive visits per week.</li><li>Build half-day resets into schedules where needed.</li><li>Protect debrief time as non‑negotiable (not a “nice to have”).</li></ul><p>People who haven’t done fieldwork often only see the interview hour. They don’t see the off-stage work: ethics, documentation, travel (and all the drama of delays and connectivity), relationship management, safeguarding alignment, the emotional labour of holding space, and the operational coordination required to get usable data without harming anyone.</p><p>So if your team asks for frequent check-ins or expects you to do additional work, ensure that you set their expectations by walking them through all the off stage work needed.</p><h4>5) Run a dynamic risk assessment on the day (including semi‑public spaces)</h4><p>Conditions change fast: staffing, space, local incidents, illness levels, travel disruption. Your plan needs a mechanism for responding without stress.</p><p>And if you’re observing in semi‑public spaces (corridors, waiting rooms, receptions): plan for bystanders who didn’t consent. Decide what you record, how you protect privacy, and when you pause or reposition.</p><h3>My template (use it and adapt it)</h3><p>I’m sharing the template I now use as a default for discovery projects, user research and service design work across education, health, social care, pharmaceutical, justice, and other high‑stakes environments.</p><p>It’s intentionally written as a template: you’ll need to tailor it to your organisation’s safeguarding policy, ethics process, and the host setting’s local requirements.</p><p>If you’re working with children or vulnerable adults, you should always align the plan with the host organisation’s safeguarding lead and your own organisational safeguarding lead before fieldwork starts.</p><h3>Safeguarding plan template for research (and design)</h3><h3>1. Document control</h3><p>Table 1 shows the data fields that you can use for document control.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of a table showing document control data fields."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TanZZ_EDe27dSYWzyrZ7gg.png"" /><figcaption>Document control data fields. Screenshot by the author.</figcaption></figure><h3>2. Purpose and scope</h3><p>This plan sets out how we prevent harm, recognise distress or risk, respond to concerns (including disclosures), and learn from incidents. It covers:</p><ul><li>Participant safeguarding (physical, psychological, cultural, and digital safety)</li><li>Researcher safeguarding (physical safety, psychological wellbeing, and lone-working)</li><li>Safeguarding of third parties (people mentioned during research, bystanders, or dependents)</li><li>Data governance and reporting practices that reduce risk and re-identification</li><li>Decision-making for consent, capacity, and involving guardians or gatekeepers</li><li>How participants raise concerns/complaints after participation (include contact details on information sheets and at session close)</li></ul><h3>3. Principles (proposed by</h3><p>We adopt a <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-definition-of-trauma-informed-practice/working-definition-of-trauma-informed-practice"">trauma-informed approach</a> and embed these principles into recruitment, consent, session design, data handling, analysis, and reporting:</p><ul><li>Safety (physical and psychological)</li><li>Accessibility (physical and remote)</li><li>Trustworthiness</li><li>Collaboration</li><li>Choice and transparency</li><li>Empowerment</li><li>Cultural considerations (including gender responsiveness)</li><li>Recognising where there may be a potential for re‑traumatisation, and preventing it</li></ul><h3>4. Governance, roles and escalation</h3><p>Define clear accountability and an escalation path so researchers can act quickly and consistently.<br />Roles (tailor):</p><ul><li>Safeguarding Lead/Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL): receives concerns, decides next steps, liaises with statutory services</li><li>Research Lead: ensures this plan is implemented, approves risk mitigations, oversees training</li><li>Fieldwork Lead/Moderator (researcher on the ground): runs sessions, monitors distress, logs incidents</li><li>Data Lead/Data Protection Officer (DPO): ensures secure handling, minimisation, and access control</li><li>Partner/Gatekeeper Liaison: coordinates with schools/care settings/community organisations without coercion</li></ul><p>Table 2 provides a worked example of an escalation map you can adapt and complete.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of an escalation map."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ckbc6eqQZuR9bwltcZGefQ.png"" /><figcaption>Escalation map.

Risk assessment (before fieldwork)</h3><p>Complete a safeguarding risk assessment for the topic, participant group, methods, and setting (in-person/remote). Use the risk matrix in Appendix A.</p><p><strong>At minimum, assess:</strong></p><ul><li>Sensitivity of topic and likelihood of triggering content</li><li>Participant vulnerability (age, disability, trauma exposure, dependency, power imbalance)</li><li>Setting risks (home visits, public spaces, care settings, online sessions)</li><li>Researcher exposure (secondary trauma, lone-working, travel, hostility)</li><li>Observers/note takers: their needs, triggers, and responsibilities (they’re part of the safeguarding environment too)</li><li>Data risks (identifiers, recordings, storage access, retention)</li><li>Third‑party risks (information about children/dependents/others)</li><li>Language and culture as barriers to participation; plan accordingly</li></ul><p><strong>Additional in-person fieldwork risks (especially post‑COVID):</strong></p><ul><li>Public health/infection-control risks (outbreaks, PPE/visitor rules, ventilation, hand hygiene)</li><li>Clinical/biohazard risks where applicable (follow site infection-control protocols/training)</li><li>Travel and fatigue risks (long days, commute safety, late finishes)</li><li>Environmental/neighbourhood risks (area safety, transport availability, accessibility, lone travel after dark)</li></ul><p><strong>High-security settings (prisons/secure hospitals):</strong></p><ul><li>restricted devices/recording, staff presence of in the sessions, coercion risk, emergency procedures, lockdown/incident response.</li></ul><p>Plan for a dynamic risk assessment on the day.</p><h3>6. Recruitment, screening, and participation support (including incentives)</h3><p>Recruitment must be voluntary, proportionate, and designed to avoid coercion.</p><ul><li>Use plain-language invitations and information sheets</li><li>Avoid recruiting via a person with direct power over the participant where possible (manager, teacher, clinician, prison staff). If unavoidable, add safeguards to protect voluntariness.</li><li>Screen for immediate risk: if a participant is in acute crisis, signpost support and do not proceed.</li><li>Plan accessible formats (easy-read, large print, multiple languages, captions)</li></ul><p>Incentives, reimbursement, and participation costs:</p><ul><li>Equity: consider reimbursement for expenses and costs of participation (including for staff, service users, or people in custody, subject to policy).</li><li>Document: amount, rationale, delivery route, timing, and what personal data is required to pay it.</li><li>Confirm host policies: e.g., whether staff can accept gifts, and prison rules on incentives.</li><li>Document potential issues: undue influence, misrepresentation, and how you’ll mitigate (neutral framing, ethical screening, opt‑out preserved).</li></ul><h3>7. Consent and capacity (adults, vulnerable adults, children)</h3><p>Consent is ongoing, informed, and freely given. Use staged consent for recordings, artefact review, and attribution. Reconfirm at key moments.</p><p>Operational note: don’t assume digital consent will work. Bring printed packs for in-person sessions, or allow time at the start of remote sessions to complete consent. Confirm verbally and record confirmation; have a second team member witness if required.</p><p>Table 3 shows a worked example of a decision pathway that you can adapt.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of a decision pathway for consent and assent."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mxrX5ynibKw3U7Cq3kghDw.png"" /><figcaption>Decision pathway for consent and assent. Screenshot by the author.</figcaption></figure><p>Capacity checks (use appropriate local framework):</p><ul><li>Explain in a way the person can understand (visuals/easy read as needed)</li><li>Check understanding (ask them to describe what will happen and their right to stop)</li><li>If they cannot understand/retain/weigh/communicate a decision even with support, do not take consent from them alone</li></ul><p>Provide complaints/concerns contact details on the info sheet and repeat at close.</p><h3>8. Participant safeguarding during sessions</h3><p>Build “safety by design” into every touchpoint.</p><p><strong>Baseline safeguards:</strong></p><ul><li>Content warnings and a plain-language roadmap</li><li>“Menu of participation” (topics, depth, mode, anonymity)</li><li>Choice throughout (breaks, camera off, written chat, skip questions)</li><li>Use redacted/synthetic artefacts by default</li><li>Normalise opting out without explanation</li><li>Support signposting at start and end</li><li>Avoid leading and probing language; also avoid pathologising terms</li><li>Close with a grounding option if useful</li></ul><p><strong>Remote-session enhancements:</strong></p><ul><li>Confirm participant is in a safe/private space; offer “switch topic” / “stop now” phrase</li><li>Collect emergency contacts only where needed</li><li>Use secure platforms; lock meetings; manage screen-sharing/chat safely</li><li>If using an AI tool to record for later notes and analysis, inform the participant. Build that into your consent forms</li><li>If remote observation is allowed, inform the participant. It’s unethical to allow a session to be watched by 10 observers via tools such as <a href=""https://info.heymarvin.com/marvin-ai-research-software-fe?utm_campaign_id=&amp;utm_term=marvin%20software&amp;utm_campaign=gs_cpc_brand_maxconv_kwds_marvin&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=2315755094&amp;hsa_cam=23058402392&amp;hsa_grp=186754625740&amp;hsa_ad=787418153179&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-344036103553&amp;hsa_kw=marvin%20software&amp;hsa_mt=e&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=23058402392&amp;gbraid=0AAAAApcRwVqn4UhpUqzsCm0IRRpNJaX_3&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAgvPKBhCxARIsAOlK_EqA5zmRIA3LuPAbVm0AL8IK5ScvprJuNTXpcqAO_6Juxk3zpnMLJg4aAqxCEALw_wcB"">Marvin</a> etc, while you introduced only one observer visible to the participant on MS Teams meeting.

<h4>We have decades of data proving design’s business value. So why do we still lose every budget fight?</h4><figure><img alt=""Abstract geometric illustration in Mondrian style with overlapping rectangles in red, blue, yellow and black, representing design frameworks and business structure"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_wRdyx0G_yje4RDYTxkNFw.png"" /><figcaption>Generated using Midjourney</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve watched it happen too many times. You spend weeks researching, prototyping, testing. The users love it. The data backs it. Then someone in the room says “I don’t like blue” or “my wife thinks this is confusing” and suddenly everything’s back on the table. Design decisions get discarded like they’re optional decorations, not strategic choices backed by evidence.</p><p>In most companies I’ve worked with, design is an afterthought. Something you add after the important decisions get made. Which means when budget cuts come, when timelines compress, when stakeholders disagree — design goes first. And the worst part? We stand there unable to articulate why that’s a mistake in terms anyone will listen to.</p><p>Here’s what makes this infuriating: <strong>the evidence that design creates business value is unambiguous</strong>. McKinsey studied 300 publicly listed companies over five years and found that top-quartile design performers achieved <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-business-value-of-design"">32% points higher revenue growth and 56% points higher total returns to shareholders</a>. The Design Management Institute tracked design-led companies for a decade and found they <a href=""https://fortune.com/2017/08/31/the-design-value-index-shows-what-design-thinking-is-worth/"">outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 211%</a>.</p><p>Yet design teams get cut disproportionately during layoffs. We lose budget allocation fights. We remain stuck in service organization roles while marketing and product management sit at the strategic table making decisions about what we’ll build.</p><p>The problem isn’t that design lacks value. The problem is that we — as a profession — never learned how to prove it in language that organizations understand.</p><p>And this isn’t about individual designers being bad at business. This is systemic. This is about how design professionalized, how design education evolved, and how the industry systematically failed to build business articulation capability into our DNA from the start.</p><p>John Maeda’s annual <a href=""https://designintech.report/"">Design in Tech reports</a> have tracked design’s rise in Silicon Valley for over a decade, documenting the evolution from “classical design” to “computational design.” His 2024 report carried an urgent warning: “Work Transformation Is Coming FAST” for design careers. Yet even as design’s technical capabilities expanded, its business legitimacy remained precarious.</p><h3>We inherited a philosophy that actively opposed commercial thinking</h3><p>The roots go deeper than you’d think. When Walter Gropius established the Bauhaus in 1919, he deliberately positioned design as an artistic and technical pursuit <em>opposed to</em> commercial concerns. The curriculum emphasized “form follows function” and workshop-based learning, but <a href=""https://novedge.com/blogs/design-news/design-software-history-the-influence-of-the-bauhaus-movement-on-the-evolution-of-design-software-and-its-lasting-legacy-in-modern-design-practices"">explicitly excluded business, history, and commercial context</a>.</p><p>This wasn’t neutral. It established a professional identity centered on craft excellence and creative autonomy — values that positioned designers as separate from commercial enterprise. When László Moholy-Nagy founded the New Bauhaus in Chicago in 1937 and Josef Albers joined Black Mountain College, they carried this DNA into American design education. The pattern replicated through Ulm, RISD, and eventually into the academic design programs that produce most professional designers today.</p><p>Mike Monteiro frames this inheritance bluntly in <a href=""https://www.designisajob.com""><em>Design Is a Job</em></a>: designers must understand they’re “running a business, not a hobby.” Yet this framing contradicts the very foundation of modern design education, which positioned commercial concerns as antithetical to craft excellence. While marketing departments in the 1950s-70s were learning to speak the language of ROI and revenue attribution, design schools were teaching students that commercial thinking corrupted creative integrity.</p><p>Nigel Cross’s influential 1982 paper <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Cross"">“Designerly Ways of Knowing”</a> cemented this separation by establishing design as a “third culture” distinct from both sciences and humanities. While this legitimized design academically, it also reinforced our distance from business disciplines. Cross positioned design cognition as fundamentally different from analytical thinking — valuable insight that inadvertently made cross-functional translation harder.</p><p><strong>Compare this to other professions</strong>. The <a href=""https://www.carnegiefoundation.org/about/who_we_are/our-legacy/"">Flexner Report of 1910</a> transformed medical education by standardizing training and establishing clear professional standards. The <a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1908453"">Carnegie Foundation’s subsequent studies</a> of law, medicine, and engineering identified a pattern: successful professional education combines technical skill with professional identity formation that includes service, responsibility, and yes — business reality.</p><p>Design education never underwent equivalent transformation. There was no Flexner Report for design. No moment of standardization that required business competency as part of becoming a professional designer.</p><p>So we learned to make beautiful things, thoughtful things, user-centered things. But nobody taught us how to defend them when someone asks “What’s the ROI?”</p><p>Design education’s failure to incorporate business competency isn’t new criticism. <a href=""https://jnd.org/why-design-education-must-change/"">Don Norman</a> — former Apple VP and author of The Design of Everyday Things — has spent decades advocating for educational reform. In his influential 2010 essay “Why Design Education Must Change,” Norman observed that designers often lack “requisite understanding” of behavioral sciences, technology, and business: “Design schools do not train students about these complex issues, about the interlocking complexities of human and social behavior.” His 2019 <a href=""https://www.futureofdesigneducation.org/about"">Future of Design Education</a> initiative with IBM’s Karel Vredenburg brought together 600+ volunteers to address the gap between <a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/90669651/inside-don-normans-herculean-quest-to-fix-design-education"">design education</a> and professional demands. Yet as Norman noted, “the vast majority of schools [remain] incredibly resistant, unable to change.”</p><figure><img alt=""Timeline comparing professionalization paths: Marketing (1950s-2010s), Product Management (1931–1998), Design (ongoing gap in business education)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9VCLeyxHTdJjROHLjdWUBw.png"" /><figcaption>Source: Author</figcaption></figure><h3>Meanwhile, marketing and product management learned the language of power</h3><p>Understanding why design gets marginalized requires looking at how other functions earned their strategic seats. The histories of marketing and product management reveal paths we haven’t followed.</p><p>Marketing’s strategic ascent took decades. In the 1950s, marketing existed primarily as advertising coordination. By the 1970s, marketers at companies like Procter &amp; Gamble had assumed profit-and-loss responsibility — a critical legitimizing move that forced financial accountability. The CMO title appeared in the 1990s, and by the 2010s, <a href=""https://hbr.org/2017/07/the-evolution-of-the-cmo"">marketing led digital activities in 92% of companies</a>.</p><p>The key transition? Marketers learned to speak in revenue attribution, customer acquisition cost, lifetime value — the language finance already understood.</p><p>Product management’s rise is even more instructive. The role started with Neil McElroy’s 1931 “Brand Man” memo at Procter &amp; Gamble, defining someone responsible for tracking sales and driving business outcomes. When Bill Hewlett and David Packard adapted this at HP in the 1940s, they created the modern product manager as “voice of the customer internally.”</p><p>But the decisive framing came from <a href=""https://hbr.org/2017/07/the-evolution-of-the-cmo"">Ben Horowitz’s 1998 memo “Good Product Manager/Bad Product Manager,”</a> which positioned PMs as “CEO of the product” — explicitly claiming strategic accountability rather than coordination responsibility.</p><p>Sociologist Andrew Abbott’s “The System of Professions” (1988) provides the framework for understanding these trajectories. Abbott argues that professions compete over “jurisdictions” — claims of ownership over expert knowledge. A profession gains legitimacy through diagnosis (classifying problems), inference (applying knowledge), and treatment (implementing solutions).</p><p>Marketing claimed the customer relationship jurisdiction. Product management claimed product success jurisdiction.</p><p>What jurisdiction has design claimed that executives recognize as strategically essential?</p><p><a href=""https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amr.1995.9508080331"">Mark Suchman’s legitimacy research</a> (Academy of Management Review, 1995) identifies three forms: pragmatic (“What can you do for me?”), moral (normative approval), and cognitive (taken-for-grantedness). Cognitive legitimacy is most powerful but rarest.</p><p>Marketing and product management have achieved cognitive legitimacy in most organizations — their presence at strategic discussions is assumed. Design remains trapped at pragmatic level, constantly having to prove immediate utility.</p><figure><img alt=""Comparison table showing Marketing, Product Management, Engineering, and Design across jurisdiction claims, metrics used, and legitimacy status"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YZA01jEzLvsDqEuM6shK5w.png"" /><figcaption>Source: Author</figcaption></figure><h3>The metrics we use don’t connect to decisions executives make</h3><p>Here’s where the disconnect gets concrete. Designers measure experience quality: task completion rates, System Usability Scale scores, Net Promoter Score, user satisfaction surveys.</p><p>These metrics measure something real. But as <a href=""https://businessofsoftware.org/talks/design-metrics-matter-jared-spool/"">Jared Spool observed</a>: “The metrics out of the box didn’t help us one little bit. They just created confusion.”</p><p>The problem isn’t that NPS or SUS are invalid. It’s that they exist in a different causal chain than executive decision-making. Look at the structure:</p><p><strong>Marketing:</strong> Revenue attribution → Direct (clicks → purchases)<br /><strong>Engineering:</strong> Delivery metrics → Direct (code → features)<br /><strong>Design:</strong> Experience quality → <strong>Indirect</strong> (experience → satisfaction → loyalty → <em>maybe</em> revenue)</p><p>Marketing demonstrates that campaign X generated Y dollars through clear attribution. Engineering demonstrates that sprint Z delivered features A, B, C. Design demonstrates that usability improved by some percentage — and then <em>hopes</em> executives connect this to business outcomes.</p><p>Design leader <a href=""https://www.petermerholz.com/blog/design-leadership-truisms/"">Peter Merholz</a> captured this fundamental tension in his Design Leadership Truisms: “YOU CANNOT CALCULATE AN ROI FOR DESIGN.” This isn’t defeatism — it’s acknowledgment that design’s impact is diffuse, systemic, and resistant to the neat attribution models that executives expect.</p><p>Research from behavioral economics explains why this indirection kills influence. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK593518/"">Kahneman and Tversky’s prospect theory</a> established that people weigh losses approximately twice as heavily as equivalent gains. <a href=""https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/introduction-behavioral-economics/"">Thaler’s mental accounting research</a> showed that people categorize money into different mental buckets with different decision rules.</p><p>The implication: design investments positioned as abstract improvements compete poorly against investments positioned as loss prevention or direct revenue generation.</p><p>The <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-business-value-of-design"">McKinsey Design Index study</a> quantified this disconnect: <strong>over 40% of surveyed companies don’t talk to end users during development</strong>, and <strong>less than 5% reported that their leaders could make objective design decisions</strong>. Design isn’t measured with the same rigor as time and costs — and designers “have not always embraced design metrics or actively shown management how their designs tie to meeting business goals.”</p><p>Even NPS itself is crumbling. According to <a href=""https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/wasnt-nps-supposed-to-be-all-but-gone-this-year/"">CMSWire’s 2025 analysis</a>, NPS fell from second-most popular CX metric in 2023 to eighth place in 2024. Only 23% of U.S. enterprise CX leaders now use it. The metric’s critics note weak correlation to actual behavior, lack of diagnostic capability, and score volatility — problems that make it unreliable for executive decisions even when designers treat it as gospel.</p><p>We’re speaking a language executives don’t use to make decisions. And then we’re surprised when our arguments don’t land.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hHL2Akev5ssuu-DcrsPrPA.png"" /><figcaption>Created using Midjourney.</figcaption></figure><h3>Real layoffs reveal the cost of not knowing how to defend our worth</h3><p>The consequences manifest most visibly during organizational stress. <a href=""https://www.quarterinchhole.com/p/how-the-layoffs-have-impacted-ux"">Lawton Pybus’s analysis of 2022–2024 tech layoffs</a>, tracking 5,521 laid-off employees across 12 companies, found that while engineers made up the largest share of layoffs in absolute numbers, <strong>when adjusted for team size</strong>, designers were cut at 1.7 times the expected rate, and researchers at three times the expected rate. In other words: design and research teams were disproportionately targeted.</p><p>The UX Collective’s 2024 State of UX report, authored by <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-state-of-ux-in-2024-enter-late-stage-ux-e9b403b67667"">Fabricio Teixeira</a> and <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/why-designers-quit-2023-report-24dae87d7896"">Caio Braga</a>, identified what they call “late-stage UX” — comparing the current industry state to late-stage capitalism. Their analysis of over 1,000 articles from 2023 found design characterized by “market saturation, heavy focus on financial growth, commoditization, automation, and increased financialization.” Designers can now only push so far when advocating for user needs against corporate influence. Matej Latin’s 2023 survey of 293 designers found that 14.3% were laid off — a staggering increase from 2022, when layoffs weren’t significant enough to track.</p><p>Indeed’s job posting data showed UX Research positions decreased <strong>89%</strong> from their 2022 peak to January 2024.</p><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/why-is-the-ux-job-market-such-a-mess-right-now-a-comprehensive-explanation-97d5588696fd"">Jared Spool</a>, in his January 2024 analysis “Why is the UX job market such a mess right now?”, pushed back on the myth that UX was disproportionately targeted: “There’s no evidence to support this. When Meta laid off 21,000 people in 2022 and 2023, a few hundred were UX people… UX people were never more than a small proportion of the total people let go.” Yet this statistical nuance provides cold comfort — whether designers were targeted specifically or caught in broader cuts, the result remains: design teams shrinking, roles disappearing, and a profession unable to articulate why this is strategically catastrophic.</p><p>Google Cloud’s October 2025 layoffs cut 100+ design-related positions, with some design teams reduced by half. The pattern repeats: when cost-cutting pressures intensify, design becomes expendable because its contribution remains unquantified.</p><p>I’ve seen this up close. Talented designers with years of institutional knowledge, cut because nobody could articulate their business value in the thirty seconds it took finance to scan the headcount spreadsheet.</p><p><strong>Intuit’s 2007 Design for Delight launch</strong> illustrates how articulation failures play out even with executive support. Founder Scott Cook invited Intuit’s top 300 managers to an off-site to introduce design thinking. He delivered a five-hour PowerPoint presentation. The result: “Polite, yet unengaged response.”</p><p>Then Stanford’s Alex Kazaks presented for one hour using hands-on exercises. Two-thirds of participants said most of what they learned occurred in Kazaks’ session.</p><p>The lesson: even well-intentioned design advocacy fails when it relies on abstract arguments rather than experiential demonstration and financial connection.</p><p><a href=""https://fortune.com/2017/03/20/pepsico-design-chief-mauro-porcini/"">PepsiCo’s Chief Design Officer Mauro Porcini</a> (2012–2025) identified three phases design leaders face:</p><h3><strong>Denial</strong> (“The company doesn’t understand that they need you”),</h3><h3><strong>Hidden Rejection</strong> (“Everybody’s nice in meetings, then as soon as you’re out, they’re like, ‘Okay, let’s go back to real life’”),</h3><h3>and <strong>Occasional Leap of Faith</strong> (“You find some people, the co-conspirators, that decide to bet on you”).</h3><p>Porcini built a 400-designer team and won 1,800+ design awards — but only after finding executive “co-conspirators” willing to champion design’s strategic role.</p><p>This pattern of organizational resistance isn’t unique to PepsiCo. <a href=""https://www.petermerholz.com/blog/design-leadership-is-change-management/"">Peter Merholz</a>, in his “Finding Our Way” podcast interviewing senior design executives, identified a consistent theme: “Design leadership is change management.” As Katrina Alcorn, GM of Design for IBM, told him: “We’re change agents because all of us doing this are still part of a movement to change how businesses work, how they run.”</p><p><strong>Apple’s post-Ive trajectory</strong> reveals what happens when design loses its executive champion. After Jony Ive’s 2019 departure, nearly his entire 24-person design team left — Evans Hankey, Tang Tan, Duncan Kerr, Jody Akana, and <a href=""https://apple.gadgethacks.com/news/apple-loses-key-ui-designer-to-meta-design-exodus-reveals/"">more than a dozen others</a>. Design’s strategic position at Apple depended on Jobs’s protection and Ive’s access; remove those, and organizational gravity pulled design back toward service function.</p><h3>We’re speaking different languages and don’t even realize it</h3><p>The communication divide operates at multiple levels. <a href=""https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1671890/FULLTEXT01.pdf"">Carlile’s 2002 research on knowledge boundaries</a> identifies “syntactic boundaries” from differences in vocabulary and protocols between professional groups. When designers say “user pain points” and executives hear vague qualitative concerns rather than quantifiable friction costs, both sides are speaking accurately from their own frameworks — and neither is communicating.</p><p>Recent data quantifies the scope: <a href=""https://fullscale.io/blog/cross-functional-collaboration-development-product-design/"">78% of organizations report significant barriers between technical departments</a>, 65% of project failures stem from poor communication between teams, and 82% of companies lack unified success metrics across departments.</p><p>Design’s articulation problem exists within this broader organizational communication failure — but we’re uniquely disadvantaged because our native vocabulary diverges most sharply from financial language.</p><p><a href=""https://www.mindtheproduct.com/how-can-we-build-human-centred-products-by-kim-goodwin/"">Kim Goodwin</a>, who spent decades teaching designers stakeholder communication at Cooper, observed the deeper problem: “It’s not about just doing great design; that’s maybe half the problem. I think that’s actually less than half the problem.” The other half? Understanding how decisions actually get made in organizations — and speaking that language fluently.</p><p>Research on <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9873534/"">boundary spanners</a> defines effective cross-functional communicators as those “familiar with the various professional vernacular and routines of different organizations.” This capability is learnable. But design education doesn’t teach it.</p><p><a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/bias-busters-when-the-question-not-the-answer-is-the-mistake"">Framing research from behavioral economics</a> explains why the direction of translation matters. Tversky and Kahneman’s work shows that identical information presented differently leads to different decisions. Loss framing proves more persuasive for action than gain framing.</p><p>The implication: “We improved usability by 15%” loses to “We’re losing $500K annually to poor checkout UX” — same reality, radically different executive response.</p><p>I learned this the hard way. Early in my career, I’d walk into stakeholder meetings armed with beautiful research findings, usability scores, user quotes. I thought the quality of the work would speak for itself.</p><p>It didn’t.

Kerry Rodden, Hilary Hutchinson, and Xin Fu developed HEART in their 2010 CHI conference paper “<a href=""https://research.google/pubs/measuring-the-user-experience-on-a-large-scale-user-centered-metrics-for-web-applications/"">Measuring the User Experience on a Large Scale: User-Centered Metrics for Web Applications</a>,” specifically to fill the gap between small-scale qualitative observations and large-scale automated measurement.</p><p>Google uses it internally across products. The Gmail “undo send” feature emerged from <a href=""https://www.lyssna.com/blog/google-heart-framework/"">happiness metrics tracking</a>.</p><p>Jared Spool’s outcome-driven metrics, detailed in his famous “<a href=""https://articles.centercentre.com/three_hund_million_button/"">$300 Million Button</a>” case study, focus on “problem-value metrics” — quantifying UX obstacles in dollar terms. An e-commerce company identified checkout failures through usability testing, created a custom metric (“unrealized shopping cart value from password issues”), implemented guest checkout, and recovered $300 million annually.</p><p>The metric framing transformed “registration causes friction” into financial language executives understood. Spool’s principle: “Surface the cost of not removing obstacles — this gives executives a perspective about UX they’ve never had before.”</p><p><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/calculating-roi-design-projects/""><strong>Nielsen Norman Group’s ROI framework</strong></a> attempts direct financial calculation, though they appropriately note that “ROI calculations are strategic exercises to help you conceptualize the relative value of design projects.

This problem is systemic. Solutions must be too.</p><p><strong>Design education must incorporate business competency as core requirement.</strong> The <a href=""https://carey.jhu.edu/explore-carey-mba/design-leadership"">Johns Hopkins/MICA Design Leadership MA/MBA</a> and <a href=""https://id.iit.edu/graduate-school/master-of-design-mba/"">IIT Institute of Design MDes/MBA</a> programs exist because the market recognizes this gap. But such programs remain exceptions.</p><p>Mainstreaming business literacy into undergraduate and bootcamp design education would address the problem at source.</p><p><strong>Professional organizations must build measurement infrastructure.</strong> Shared databases of design effectiveness case studies, common metrics frameworks, longitudinal research programs would provide the evidential base we currently lack. The <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-business-value-of-design"">McKinsey Design Index</a> and <a href=""https://fortune.com/2017/08/31/the-design-value-index-shows-what-design-thinking-is-worth/"">DMI Design Value Index</a> demonstrate the concept’s power.</p><p><strong>Designers must learn to speak both languages</strong> without abandoning native expertise. This isn’t about becoming business people who do some design. It’s about developing boundary-spanning capability that research identifies as critical for cross-functional influence.</p><p><strong>Organizations investing in design must create structural legitimacy.</strong> IBM’s transformation worked because Gilbert built organizational infrastructure — not just because IBM hired designers. Design Program Offices, certification programs, embedded teams, executive sponsorship.</p><p>And for those of us in the trenches right now?</p><p>Start translating. Every design recommendation you make, every research finding you present — ask yourself: “How would I frame this in terms of revenue, cost reduction, or risk mitigation?”</p><p>It feels reductive at first. It feels like we’re reducing craft to spreadsheets.</p><p>But here’s the thing: the alternative is watching your best work get discarded because someone in the room didn’t like the color blue.</p><h3>The paradox we need to resolve</h3><p>Jodi Rae, when creating the Design Value Index, captured design’s fundamental challenge: “People who are convinced of the value of design are not interested in quantifying it. The CEOs in all of the DVI companies already understand the power of design… Those most interested in quantifying the value of design are the financial people, which shows they don’t really understand the power of design.”</p><p>This paradox isn’t inevitable. It’s the predictable outcome of a profession that built exceptional craft capability while neglecting business articulation capability.</p><p>The good news? This problem is structural, not inherent.</p><p>Marketing learned to prove ROI. Product management learned to claim strategic accountability. HR learned to speak in financial terms. Data science learned to demonstrate decision impact.</p><p>Each discipline underwent professionalization transitions that design has yet to complete.</p><p>The research suggests this transition is achievable — but requires coordinated action: education reform, professional infrastructure, organizational change, individual development.</p><p>We’re not the cause of this problem. But we’re positioned to catalyze its solution.</p><p>Design’s business value is empirically demonstrated. The task now is building the professional infrastructure to articulate it — to translate craft excellence into language that organizational decision-making recognizes and rewards.</p><p>Because the alternative is watching another generation of talented designers get laid off while someone in finance looks at a spreadsheet and decides design is optional.</p><p>It’s not. And it’s time we learned how to prove it.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=79f2e7d59c8b"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/when-your-best-work-gets-tossed-79f2e7d59c8b"">When your best work gets tossed</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>How researchers can define quality, guide prompts, and shape the value of AI outputs.</h4><p>AI agents, synthetic users, deep research, staying relevant as a UX researcher can feel like a challenge that resets every week. Teams across product, design, and engineering are moving faster than ever, often powered by the same underlying AI technologies. <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/human-machine-responsible-ai-workflows-for-ux-research-22a5c39ac0ec"">Prompt engineering and system design have quickly become central topics across disciplines</a>, raising a familiar, and uncomfortable, question: <em>where does UX research fit now?</em></p><p>My experience building LLM-based products over the past two years has led me to a clear conclusion. This moment is not the end of UX research. It is the same work we have always done, understanding people, defining value, but applied to a new class of systems. And for researchers willing to adapt, it creates an opportunity to move upstream and become more strategic than ever. As products become cheaper to build and AI spreads across nearly every workflow, teams now face a new foundational decision: how much AI should this feature contain?</p><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/is-your-ai-use-case-idea-really-going-to-work-7718c695e7c0"">When the answer is “yes”, and it is not always</a>, the work does not stop there. A second, equally important question follows: <em>what form should that AI take?</em> One of the most prescient frameworks in this space comes from <a href=""https://www.emcap.com/thoughts/your-success-with-generative-ai-may-come-down-to-these-ux-decisions"">Jake Saper and Jessica Cohen at Emergence Capital, who describe AI products along a spectrum</a>. On one end are pure chat-based systems that maximize flexibility. On the other are AI-enhanced features that trade flexibility for simplicity. Most production features live closer to the latter. The product defines the prompt, sometimes with light user input, and delivers the output in a predetermined format. Every “summarize,” “rewrite,” or “generate” button we encounter today reflects this tradeoff.</p><p>Delivering value with AI enhanced features means having a solid understanding of what the user is attempting to achieve within the context of their workflow both for the actual output and the design of how it is delivered. Take for example, a summarize feature. A summary can mean many different things depending on where it is being delivered. A “Summarize” button offered in Gmail likely needs punchy and bulleted contents. The same within Adobe acrobat for a large PDF could mean a multi paragraph executive summary. It is all about context and the actual need in the moment. The same we have always been doing but new.</p><figure><img alt=""Adobe buttons for taking AI Actions"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/774/1*lYL-7x1LLVuJ-LBP0ey62w.png"" /><figcaption>Adobe buttons for taking AI Actions</figcaption></figure><p>NotebookLM offers a compelling example of this shift. The product began as a chat-based, retrieval-augmented system. It gained widespread attention with its audio overview feature, which generated a podcast-style summary of a user’s materials, no prompting required. That feature delivered immediate, differentiated value by meeting a specific user need in a novel format. While the initial novelty has faded, subsequent updates have reinforced NotebookLM’s position as a model for AI-enhanced productivity.</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of the NotebookLM feature including sources, the overview page, and the studio feature."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5e0Ox6q7MpceIhZjBBiXBw.png"" /><figcaption>A screenshot of the NotebookLM feature including sources, the overview page, and the studio features</figcaption></figure><p>The Studio feature set within NotebookLM illustrates the pattern particularly well. Users are presented with a set of structured options that guide them toward generating reports, briefs, or analyses. The real power lies not in unrestricted chat, but in the ability to lightly customize a pre-generated prompt. In Emergence Capital’s terms, this is a true copilot: a system that helps users provide the right input in order to receive a valuable output. When a user asks NotebookLM to generate a report, success is not defined by grammatical correctness or factual accuracy alone. Success is whether the output fits the user’s actual need, whether it advances their task, supports their workflow, or deepens their understanding.</p><p>This is where the role of UX research begins to change… not in kind, but in scope.</p><h3>A New Way to Create Value</h3><p>Creating value with LLM-based features is not about writing the cleverest prompt. It is about defining the right instructions so the system produces something that is genuinely useful to the user in that moment. Prompt quality matters, but prompts do not exist in a vacuum. They sit at the intersection of engineering, design, and, critically, research.</p><p>NotebookLM’s opening chat response is a useful example. As a user logs in, the chat window is filled with an overview of all contents that helps users make sense of their materials as soon as they open a notebook, reducing the cognitive cost of re-orienting themselves. Engineering work was required to craft prompts that reliably surface the right insights. Design work was required to decide how that information should appear on the page. But neither of those efforts can succeed without first understanding what users actually need at the moment of entry. That understanding is where research does its most important work, informing both what the system should generate and how that output should be presented.</p><figure><img alt=""NotebookLM opens with a summary of the Notebooks"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Hk912CHJxIPta3jysWeUEg.png"" /><figcaption>NotebookLM opens with a summary of the Notebooks</figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/ai-ux-design-for-intelligent-interfaces-bc966e96107d"">Design guidance for displaying AI-generated content is relatively well covered.</a> <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/search?q=ai+in+product"">Many strong frameworks already exist for structuring text, surfacing key information, and presenting outputs in ways that are readable and actionable.</a> What has received far less attention is the upstream work of shaping the instructions that guide generation in the first place. Ensuring a prompt is directionally correct — aligned to real user needs rather than abstract capabilities, was always important. With LLMs, it becomes foundational.</p><p>This is where UX research creates new leverage. By engaging early, researchers can help teams anchor feature development in what is actually possible given both the state of the technology and the user’s needs in context. In my experience, this approach consistently opens up more promising product directions. Instead of retrofitting research onto an already-defined solution, teams start with a shared understanding of value, giving design and engineering a clearer target to aim for as they build.</p><h3>A New Process for Defining Quality in Outputs</h3><p>For decades, UX research has focused on identifying the user needs a product must satisfy. That part of the work is unchanged. What <em>is</em> new is the nature of the systems we are designing. With large language models, teams no longer have complete control over outputs. These systems are inherently non-deterministic, we can guide them, but we cannot fully dictate what they will produce.</p><p>In traditional product design, many needs could be satisfied with deterministic solutions. When Apple realized people were using their iPhones as flashlights, the solution was straightforward: a single button that produced a single, predictable outcome. One tap, immediate value. No ambiguity, no interpretation required. That model works well when the need is simple and the desired outcome is clear.</p><figure><img alt=""iPhone flashlight buttons that is placed on the Lock Screen for ease of use"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*WDyogOfVTb78FQwo"" /><figcaption>iPhone flashlight buttons that is placed on the Lock Screen for ease of use</figcaption></figure><p>As needs become more complex, so does the solution. Uber faced a different problem: passengers felt anxious while waiting for their ride. The company could not control the behavior of individual drivers, so instead it designed an experience to manage uncertainty. <a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/uber-algorithm-fake/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">A live map showed the driver’s progress (although not always truthfully)</a>. Messaging explained potential delays. Contact options gave users a sense of agency. Each element addressed the same underlying issue, negative sentiment during the wait, even though the core system remained unpredictable.</p><figure><img alt=""A screen grab of a car moving toward a destination on Uber App"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*SrfQbAaDBqm8Gh6H"" /><figcaption>A screen grab of a car moving toward a destination on Uber App</figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://medium.com/ai-ux-designers/ai-is-breaking-free-an-emerging-ai-ux-pattern-26894a915d93"">Working with LLMs is similar, but amplified</a>. An LLM behaves less like a traditional interface and more like a human collaborator: responsive, capable, and inconsistent. It may produce insightful results one moment and confident-sounding nonsense the next. This unpredictability is not a flaw; it is a property of the technology. The challenge, then, is not eliminating variability, but maximizing output quality despite it.</p><p>That challenge requires a different approach. Rather than treating quality as an after-the-fact judgment, teams must define what “good” looks like in advance, and do so in a way that acknowledges uncertainty. This is where UX research plays a central role: translating user needs into clear quality signals that can guide generation, evaluation, and ongoing refinement, even when outputs cannot be fully controlled. Here is how I got about it.</p><h4>Surfacing Quality Signals</h4><p>The first step is establishing a shared understanding of what constitutes a high-quality experience. When a user requests a briefing document in NotebookLM, what are they actually expecting to see? The answer is inherently subjective. Different users bring different expectations, shaped by their goals, context, and prior experience.</p><p>This is why qualitative research is essential. In-depth interviews allow teams to understand not just <em>what</em> users say they want, but <em>how</em> they judge AI-generated outputs in practice. I start by asking users to share what they expect to see as an output. Afterwards, I walk them through examples, either outputs they already use or ones I introduce, and have them describe what they mean when they say something “informs,” “summarizes,” or “provides direction.” These conversations reveal the mental models users bring to AI systems and the tradeoffs they are willing to make.</p><p>As classic Jobs to Be Done research has shown, people are rarely asking for features in the abstract, they are trying to make progress in a specific situation. The same principle applies here. With that mindset, research becomes a game of identifying the main themes in what users are asking for in the output.</p><p>In the case of NotebookLM, early qualitative work might surface themes such as trust, cognitive relief, contextual relevance, and actionability. Users may not articulate all of these dimensions explicitly, but patterns emerge across interviews. A useful heuristic here is the 80/20 rule: a relatively small set of research-derived criteria can account for the majority of users’ expectations.</p><p>For example, a high-quality briefing report in Notebook might be judged on whether it:</p><ul><li>Feels trustworthy</li><li>Demonstrates understanding across multiple sources</li><li>Reflects the user’s current context</li><li>Connects insights to realistic next actions</li></ul><h4>Validation and Refinement</h4><p>Once core quality themes are identified, the next step is validation and refinement at scale. Surveys are particularly effective here. They allow teams to translate high-level themes into more specific, testable factors and to understand how consistently those factors matter across users and contexts. When designing these studies, I ask participants to evaluate outputs that closely resemble what the product would actually generate. Users are then asked to rate and critique those outputs, providing nuance around what makes them useful, or not.</p><p>Take trust as an example. Users frequently say they want AI outputs they can trust, but trust is not a single, universal attribute. At a minimum, it implies factual correctness. Beyond that, trust is shaped by tone, length, structure, and framing, all of which vary by context. <a href=""https://medium.com/%40mariamargarida/designing-with-ai-ux-considerations-and-best-practices-5c6b69b92c4c"">An email summary should be concise and direct. An executive briefing should surface key themes and unexpected insights.</a> A call recap should highlight action items and mention relevant stakeholders. When an output matches what users expect in that situation, trust follows.</p><p>Surveys help teams refine these distinctions. In the NotebookLM case, researchers might explore when users feel a pre-created executive briefing demonstrates contextual awareness and when it does not. For example, users may respond positively when recent meetings or emails are incorporated appropriately, and negatively when outdated or irrelevant documents are surfaced. This level of specificity is critical, it directly informs how prompts should be written and constrained.</p><h4>Creating a Quality Rubric</h4><p>With qualitative depth and survey validation in place, the next step is synthesizing insights into a shared quality rubric. There is an immediate opportunity for the engineering team to create refinement, yet as previously suggested, it is not just about the actual output but how it is designed. As such, this rubric can become the centering focus for the entire team.</p><p>A well-designed rubric defines each quality factor clearly, illustrates what good and poor outputs look like, and makes tradeoffs explicit. It allows designers, product managers, and engineers to align on what success means and how it should be evaluated. Importantly, it translates research insights into something actionable.</p><p>For prompt engineers, the rubric serves as a definition of the <strong>global maximum</strong>, the set of characteristics the system should optimize for overall. Prompt iteration can then focus on finding local maxima within that boundary, confident that improvements are aligned with real user needs rather than proxy metrics.</p><figure><img alt=""Example of Metric Rubric for NotebookLM"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*r0e7MNnSxTo_jHMxDAVlug.png"" /><figcaption>EXAMPLE: NotebookLM Summary Output Quality Rubric</figcaption></figure><h4>Continued Refinement</h4><p>Even with a strong rubric and well-crafted prompts, the work does not end. Many teams now rely on AI-based testing and automated evaluation to refine LLM outputs over time. Companies such as <a href=""https://www.braintrust.dev/"">BrainTrust</a> have built extensive platforms that allow product teams to test the output of their prompts at scale, across models. Leveraging these tools are far more effective when grounded in research-defined quality criteria.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of the Braintrust app, showing evals at scale."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ci85QVqGfpeeBUbeWFYSlw.png"" /><figcaption>Braintrust has an extensive automated evaluation system</figcaption></figure><p>A solid rubric ensures that synthetic user testing, automated scoring, and iterative refinement are anchored in metrics that matter to real people. Rather than optimizing loosely connected signals, teams can focus on outcomes that genuinely improve the user experience.</p><p>This ongoing refinement is especially important in a fast-moving market. User expectations are evolving quickly as the Overton window of what is possible with AI continues to shift. A bullet-point summary that felt impressive yesterday may be table stakes today, replaced by audio, visual, or personalized formats tomorrow. Quality rubrics must be revisited and updated as expectations change, creating a sustained, strategic role for UX research in keeping AI systems aligned with human value.</p><h3>UX Research as the Interpreter of Human Value</h3><p>The science of UX research has not changed. People are still complex, contextual, and inconsistent, and understanding what they need remains the core of the work. The methods have not changed either. UX researchers are still experts at learning from users, identifying patterns, and translating insight into action.</p><p>What <em>has</em> changed is the nature of the systems we are shaping. With LLM-based products, outputs are no longer guaranteed, and a new stakeholder, the prompt engineer, has entered the room. <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/a-practitioners-journal-on-navigating-ux-in-the-age-of-ai-97f0a11e8319"">Research now has a direct line into how AI systems are instructed, evaluated, and scaled.</a> Insights no longer stop at informing interfaces or features; they define the criteria by which machine-generated work is judged as successful.</p><p>This process is not foreign to UX research, but the leverage it creates is new. By defining quality up front, researchers can shape how intelligence itself is tuned, guiding optimization, grounding automation, and ensuring that faster iteration does not come at the expense of human value. In my own work, this shift has made the field feel more relevant and more exciting than it has in years.</p><p>Done well, UX research can become the discipline that defines what people want from AI systems, and holds those systems accountable to real outcomes. AI will continue to do more of the work. That is not changing. What can change is whether that work actually matters. UX research is uniquely positioned to make sure it does.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=36285d007845"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/same-same-but-new-ux-research-in-the-age-of-llms-36285d007845"">Same, but new: UX Research in the age of LLMs</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951226.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings, this second week of 2026 brings a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/january-monthly-horoscope-2026-meanings-effects"">relatively calm astrological atmosphere</a>, especially compared to the intensity of recent weeks, offering space to slow down and reflect. On January 11th, the asteroid Vesta enters Aquarius, shifting our focus toward devotion beyond the self. Vesta, though less commonly discussed, represents what we tend to with quiet consistency, our inner flame and sense of purpose. In Aquarius, that devotion turns toward community, collective progress, and future-minded ideals. It’s a reminder to examine where we are giving our energy and whether those commitments truly align with the world we want to help build. </p>



<p>At the same time, we’re in the final stretch of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-capricorn-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Venus in Capricorn</a> and the last <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">full week of Capricorn Season</a>. With the sun, Mercury, Venus, and Mars all in Capricorn, the emphasis is on responsibility, long-term planning, and emotional maturity. This is a productive time to get organized financially and to have honest, clarifying conversations in both friendships and romantic relationships. The shadow of this energy, however, can show up as rigidity, emotional guardedness, or being overly hard on yourself. There may also be a temptation to equate security with control or accumulation rather than trust and reciprocity. </p>



<p>From January 15th through January 17th, we enter the dark-of-the-moon in Capricorn, the reflective days leading up to the Capricorn New Moon on January 18th. Energy can feel lower, emotions more sensitive, and internal pressure around goals or responsibilities may rise. Instead of pushing for answers or outcomes, this is a time to rest, reflect, and release what no longer feels sustainable. </p>



<p>The shift begins on January 17th, when Venus enters Aquarius, helping us loosen our grip and open up to new ways of relating. This week is less about taking action and more about conscious closure, creating space so the intentions set at the New Moon can take root with clarity and purpose. </p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, this week highlights a meaningful shift in your friendship, community, and technology sector as both Vesta and Venus move into Aquarius, with Vesta arriving on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th. Vesta’s presence asks you to reflect on where your energy, time, and loyalty have been going socially and digitally, and whether those commitments still feel aligned. As Venus joins Vesta later in the week, relationships within your wider circle take on a warmer, more intentional tone. You may feel drawn to reconnect with friends who inspire you, collaborate on creative or tech- forward ideas, or redefine what support and reciprocity look like in your community. This is a powerful moment to invest in connections that feel future-oriented rather than obligatory. </p>



<p>At the same time, you’re moving through the final <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">stretch of Capricorn Season</a>, which has activated your career and long-term goals sector. Over the past few weeks, you may have been pushed to take your ambitions more seriously, confront professional realities, or step into greater leadership and responsibility. </p>



<p>As we approach the Capricorn New Moon on January 18th, the days leading up to it mark the dark of the moon in this area of your life. This can stir doubts about whether you’re on the right path, highlight burnout, or make you more aware of the pressure you place on yourself to succeed. Instead of judging these feelings, allow them to surface as useful information. Rest where you can, reflect on what feels unsustainable, and release outdated definitions of success. This New Moon is about redefining your legacy on your own terms, and honoring the version of ambition that supports both your growth and your well-being. </p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, you may have felt yourself stretching beyond your comfort zone <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">all Capricorn Season</a>, and now these next few days are encouraging you to spread your wings even further. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, your career, visibility, and long-term aspirations sector is activated. Vesta brings focus and devotion to the work you’re building and the reputation you are cultivating, asking you to reconnect with what truly motivates you professionally. </p>



<p>As Venus conjoins Vesta, there is an opportunity to feel more supported, appreciated, or inspired in your public life. You may receive recognition, have meaningful conversations about your future, or feel drawn toward work that feels more aligned with your values and vision rather than just security. </p>



<p>At the same time, we’re in the final stretch of Capricorn Season, which has been activating your sector of growth, travel, education, and big-picture belief systems. Over the past few weeks, you may have been rethinking what expansion really looks like for you and which paths are worth committing to long term. </p>



<p>As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, doubts or restlessness can surface, especially around whether you are limiting yourself out of fear or practicality. This is not a sign that you’re oﬀ track, but an invitation to pause and reflect. Give yourself permission to rest, journal, or step back from decision-making. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will offer a reset around your direction and purpose, helping you set intentions for a future that feels both grounded and expansive, built on trust in your ability to grow beyond what feels familiar. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Capricorn Season</a> has been asking you to go deeper than usual, and this week invites you to look at growth through a more expansive, future-facing lens. On January 11th, Vesta enters Aquarius, followed by Venus on January 17th, activating your sector of higher learning, travel, publishing, and belief systems. Vesta encourages you to recommit to ideas, philosophies, or long-term visions that genuinely inspire you, especially ones connected to education, spirituality, or sharing your voice more widely. </p>



<p>As Venus conjoins Vesta this week, curiosity turns into pleasure and motivation. You may feel more excited about learning something new, planning a trip, teaching, or reconnecting with a sense of purpose that extends beyond day-to-day responsibilities. </p>



<p>At the same time, you are in the final stretch of Capricorn Season, which has been illuminating themes of intimacy, shared resources, emotional vulnerability, and trust. Over the past few weeks, you may have been navigating deeper emotional or financial conversations, confronting patterns around dependence, power, or security. As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, these themes can feel heavier, bringing up doubts, fatigue, or the urge to retreat. Rather than overanalyzing what surfaces, allow yourself space to rest and process. This is a powerful time to release emotional baggage or financial stressors that no longer align with who you are becoming. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will oﬀer a reset around how you merge, share, and commit, helping you build deeper connections and a more sustainable sense of emotional and material support.</p>

<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, this week may feel like a turning point in how you relate to the people closest to you. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, your sector of intimacy, shared resources, and emotional bonds is activated. Vesta asks you to reflect on where your emotional energy and loyalty have been going, especially in close relationships, financial partnerships, or situations that require mutual trust. </p>



<p>As Venus conjoins Vesta this week, conversations around vulnerability, support, and reciprocity can soften. This is a powerful moment to renegotiate emotional or financial agreements, deepen a bond through honesty, or choose connection that feels empowering rather than draining. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, you’re moving through the final stretch of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Capricorn Season</a>, which has been illuminating your partnership sector all month. Relationships of all kinds may have required more eﬀort, accountability, or emotional maturity than usual. As we enter the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, doubts or sensitivities around commitment, balance, or whether your needs are truly being met can surface. You may feel more emotionally exposed or tired of carrying relational weight on your own. Instead of reacting, allow yourself to pause and listen to what your emotions are revealing. Rest, create space, and release expectations that feel one-sided or outdated. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will bring a powerful reset for your relationships, helping you set intentions for partnerships that support your growth, emotional safety, and long-term fulfillment. </p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, this week invites you to rethink how you show up in your closest connections and daily commitments. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, your relationship sector is activated, bringing focus to partnerships, collaborations, and the give-and-take dynamics in your life. </p>



<p>Vesta asks you to reflect on where your devotion and energy are going within one-on-one connections, and whether those relationships feel reciprocal and aligned. As Venus conjoins Vesta this week, there’s an opportunity to soften tensions, reconnect through honest conversation, or attract partnerships that feel both supportive and intellectually stimulating. This can be a meaningful moment for redefining what commitment looks like for you moving forward. </p>



<p>At the same time, you’re in the final stretch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Capricorn Season</a>, which has been highlighting your work, routines, and overall well-being. Over the past few weeks, you may have felt pressure to be more disciplined, productive, or responsible with your time and energy. As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, fatigue, self-criticism, or doubts about sustainability can surface. This is your cue to slow down rather than push harder. Prioritize rest, simplify where possible, and release habits that drain you. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will oﬀer a reset around how you care for your body, manage your workload, and create routines that support both your ambition and your vitality. </p>

<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, this week encourages you to reconnect with joy, creativity, and the things that make life feel meaningful rather than merely productive. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, your sector of daily routines, work habits, and well-being is activated. Vesta asks you to reflect on how devoted you’ve been to your responsibilities and whether your current systems actually support your health and happiness. </p>



<p>As Venus unites with Vesta this week, there’s an opportunity to bring more pleasure, ease, and even creativity into your everyday life. You may feel inspired to refresh your schedule, collaborate differently at work, or prioritize routines that feel nourishing rather than obligatory. </p>



<p>At the same time, you’re in the final stretch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Capricorn Season</a>, which has been activating your sector of romance, creativity, and self-expression. Over the past few weeks, you may have been taking your passions or love life more seriously, questioning what feels worth your time and emotional investment. </p>



<p>As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, self-doubt, creative blocks, or emotional heaviness can surface, especially if you’ve been pushing yourself to perform or prove something. Instead of critiquing yourself, allow space for rest and reflection. Step back from perfectionism and release pressure around outcomes. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will bring a sense of renewal around joy and self-expression, helping you set intentions that honor both your creative desires and your need for stability. </p>

<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, this week invites you to slow down and get reacquainted with what truly feels like home. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and your ruler Venus following on January 17th, your sector of creativity, romance, pleasure, and self-expression is activated. Vesta asks you to reflect on where your heart has been investing its energy, whether in love, creative projects, or personal passions. </p>



<p>As Venus unites with Vesta this week, inspiration flows more easily, and you may feel drawn toward connections or pursuits that allow you to express yourself more freely and authentically. This is a beautiful moment to recommit to joy, play, and creative risks that feel aligned with who you are becoming. </p>



<p>At the same time, you’re in the final stretch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Capricorn season</a>, which has been emphasizing themes around home, family, and emotional foundations. Over the past few weeks, you may have been addressing responsibilities or boundaries within your personal life, possibly feeling the weight of expectations tied to your roots or living situation. </p>



<p>As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, emotions can run deeper, bringing up fatigue, sensitivity, or questions about where you truly feel safe and supported. Rather than forcing clarity, allow yourself to rest and observe what is surfacing. The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will oﬀer a reset around your sense of belonging, helping you plant seeds for a home life that feels both stable and emotionally nourishing. </p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, this week encourages you to tune into your inner world and the conversations shaping your daily life. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, your sector of home, family, and emotional foundations is activated. </p>



<p>Vesta asks you to reflect on where your emotional energy and sense of devotion are rooted, especially within your living space or family dynamics. This is the ideal week for you to re-organize your home, sage your space, and set necessary boundaries with family members. </p>



<p>As Venus joins forces with Vesta this week, there’s an opportunity for you to soften emotional walls, create more beauty or comfort at home, or have heartfelt conversations that bring healing and understanding. You may feel called to redefine what “home” means to you, both physically and emotionally. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, you’re in the final stretch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Capricorn Season</a>, which has been activating your communication, mindset, and learning sector. Over the past few weeks, you may have been more intentional about your words, boundaries, and the information you engage with. As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, mental fatigue, self-doubt, or emotional heaviness around conversations and decisions can surface. This is a signal to slow your pace and give your mind space to rest. Journal, unplug when possible, and release thought patterns that feel overly critical or restrictive. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will oﬀer a reset around how you communicate and connect, helping you set intentions that support clarity, emotional honesty, and a more grounded inner dialogue. </p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, this week invites you to get clear about what truly holds value in your life. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, your sector of communication, learning, and daily exchanges is activated. Vesta asks you to reflect on how you use your voice, your time, and your attention, especially in conversations, writing, or digital spaces. </p>



<p>As Venus joins Vesta, words carry more warmth and intention, making this a supportive time for meaningful conversations, creative writing, or reconnecting with people who inspire your curiosity. You may feel motivated to share ideas that feel aligned with your values rather than speaking simply to be heard. </p>



<p>At the same time, you’re in the final stretch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Capricorn Season</a>, which has been highlighting your finances, self-worth, and material security. Over the past few weeks, you may have been taking a closer look at how you earn, spend, or define your sense of stability. As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, worries around money or self-esteem can surface, especially if you’ve been pushing yourself to prove your worth. Instead of spiraling, use this moment to rest and reassess. Release financial habits or narratives that feel rooted in fear rather than trust. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th brings an opportunity to reset your relationship with money and self-worth, helping you build a foundation that feels both sustainable and empowering. </p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, this week may feel quietly significant, like something important is settling into place beneath the surface. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, your sector of finances, values, and self-worth is activated. Vesta asks you to reflect on where your energy, time, and resources have been going, and whether those investments truly align with what you value most. </p>



<p>As Venus joins forces with Vesta, conversations around money, boundaries, and worth can soften, making it easier to advocate for yourself or recognize where you deserve more support, compensation, or appreciation. This is a moment to recommit to value systems that honor both your effort and your humanity. </p>



<p>At the same time, you’re in the final stretch of your season, with the sun, Mercury, Venus, and Mars all having moved through Capricorn. This has likely been an intense period of self-definition, responsibility, and growth, asking you to show up with maturity and resilience. As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, self-doubt, exhaustion, or emotional heaviness can surface, especially around identity or expectations you place on yourself. Rather than pushing through, allow yourself to slow down and release old roles or pressures that no longer fit. </p>



<p>The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will mark a powerful personal reset, inviting you to set intentions for the next chapter of your life, one rooted in authenticity, self-respect, and a vision of success that truly feels like your own. </p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, this week feels like a threshold moment, one where your inner world is preparing you for a visible shift. With Vesta entering your sign on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, the spotlight turns inward, asking you to reflect on what you are devoted to on a soul level. Vesta invites you to reconnect with your sense of purpose, identity, and personal integrity, especially around how you show up in relationships and community spaces. </p>



<p>As Venus joins Vesta, self-worth and self-expression soften and expand. You may feel more comfortable being seen, asking for what you want, or prioritizing pleasure and authenticity without guilt. This is a powerful moment for redefining how you relate to yourself before offering energy to others. </p>



<p>At the same time, you are in the final stretch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Capricorn Season</a>, which has been activating your sector of rest, closure, and subconscious patterns. Over the past few weeks, you may have been processing old emotional cycles, burnout, or the need for solitude more deeply than usual. </p>



<p>As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, fatigue, vivid emotions, or the urge to retreat can intensify. Instead of resisting this inward pull, honor it. Rest, unplug, and release habits or narratives that drain your spirit. The Capricorn New Moon on January 18th will offer a quiet but potent reset, helping you clear space internally so you can step into your next personal chapter feeling lighter, more grounded, and aligned. </p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, this week encourages you to listen closely to what is stirring beneath the surface. With Vesta entering Aquarius on January 11th and Venus following on January 17th, your sector of rest, intuition, and behind-the-scenes healing is activated. Vesta asks you to reflect on where your energy has been quietly devoted, especially in ways that may go unseen by others. </p>



<p>As Venus joins forces with Vesta, there’s an opportunity to soften your relationship with solitude, rest, and emotional processing. You may feel drawn to creative reflection, spiritual practices, or simply giving yourself permission to slow down without guilt. This is a powerful moment to tend to your inner world with care and compassion. </p>



<p>At the same time, you’re in the final stretch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Capricorn Season</a>, which has been emphasizing your friendships, community ties, and long-term aspirations. Over the past few weeks, you may have been reassessing which connections feel supportive and which ones feel draining or misaligned. </p>



<p>As we move into the dark of the moon from January 15th through January 17th, feelings of isolation, doubt, or emotional heaviness can surface, especially around belonging or your place within a group. Rather than withdrawing completely, allow yourself to observe what these emotions are revealing. Rest, release outdated expectations, and trust that not every connection needs to come with pressure or obligation. </p>

<p>As someone who grew up <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/misogyny-towards-fandoms-fangirls"">in fandom,</a> the <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/6-netflix-tv-movies-january"">People We Meet On Vacation</a></em> screenwriter Yulin Kuang knows the importance of a good <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/book-to-tv-movies-adaptations-2026"">book-to-screen adaptation</a> more than most. As a teen, she would journal pages of angst about how upcoming adaptations needed to be faithful, lest they “ruin her whole childhood.” As she’s become more successful in her career as a screenwriter and director (Kuang is currently adapting and directing Emily Henry’s <em>Beach Read</em>), she’s come to realize that the best adaptations can’t be a direct copy of the book. So yes, the <em>People We Meet On Vacation</em> movie is different from Emily Henry’s novel  — in a satisfying way.</p>



<p>“I schemed my way into a position of power and influence over my favourite books so that I could rectify and do justice to all [of them]. And I think early on in my career, I was very fixated on trying to keep things as close to the book as possible,” Kuang tells <em>Refinery29</em>. “But the reality that I’ve kind of learned over the period of time is that you can’t actually just film a novel. They’re very different things. They’re very different mediums. And so to me, the task of the adaptation is not to be 100% faithful to the book.”</p>



<p>This means die-hard book fans won’t see every single scene from the Emily Henry novel play out on screen, but while some have been removed, fresh new scenes have been introduced. Kuang says there are book scenes she would have loved to include, but it’s impossible to fit everything into the script. And even if she writes the scenes, they don’t always make it through the final edit. “They end up on the cutting room floor for whatever reason, and each one of those is a small tragedy for the book purist who resides deep within my heart,” she jokes. “But I think we also brought in a lot of things that I hope people will love too.” </p>

<p>There’s one particular scene near the start of the film which book fans won’t recognize, and it came about after the writers received feedback from Netflix. “I was really excited about that [new scene], because it felt like getting to construct Poppy (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/emily_bader/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Emily Bader</a>) and Alex (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tomblyth/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tom Blyth</a>) fanfic,” she says. “There’s definitely stuff that [book purists will] miss, because I miss it, but there’s also stuff that I hope will bring joy and delight as well.”</p>







<p>Kuang is one of Henry’s close collaborators, and while she can’t tease too much about the upcoming <em>Beach Read</em> movie (they’re currently casting, and she just had a VFX meeting), she says their working relationship was “a dream” from the start. Henry has been generous with her energy, time and thoughts, allowing Kuang to connect with the source material on a deep level. “[She would] provide me with these character maps of the characters that were always very helpful about, what’s driving them? What’s the fear?” she says. “She was so trusting, which I think, looking back now, that was such a gift.”</p>



<p>Kuang is reluctant to confirm whether book purists will embrace <em>People We Meet On Vacation</em>, and quickly knocks on wood. “I hope they do, but you can never be too prescriptive,” she says. “I <em>can </em>say this. This film by everybody, by Emily, by Brett Haley, our director, by me and the other writers, Amos and Nunzio, it was all done with so much love and care and respect for this source material… it has to stand as a work on its own that hopefully feels like a love letter to the book.”</p>

<p>Isa Briones is best known for her standout performances in the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11936018/the-pitt-season-2-characters-storyline-release-date"">medical drama </a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11936018/the-pitt-season-2-characters-storyline-release-date"">The Pitt</a></em> and as a series regular in <em><a href=""https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/star-trek-picard/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Star Trek: Picard</a></em>. Yet, what defines her just as much as her screen presence is her fierce advocacy for the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tanned-skin-south-asian-beauty-standards-sunscreen-myth"">Asian community</a>, a commitment that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lions-gate-portal-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">manifests</a> not only in the nuanced characters she chooses to play, but in her vocal stance against the rise of <a href=""https://www.amny.com/news/asian-american-figures-launch-video-campaign-as-part-of-stopasianhate-national-day-of-action-and-healing/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">hate crimes against Asian Americans</a>. </p>



<p>In the critically acclaimed HBO series <em>The Pitt</em>, Isa Briones plays Dr. Trinity Santos, a character with a name that, much like Briones’ own, carries the weight and pride of a heritage often left in the periphery of mainstream television. For Briones, the role isn’t just another credit; it’s a long-overdue correction to the medical drama genre.</p>



<p>“I find it so strange that up until now there has not really been a lot of Filipino representation in medical shows,” Briones tells <em>Refinery29. </em>It’s a gap in the narrative that feels particularly glaring when you look at the reality of the healthcare system. “It’s insane because Filipinos make up one of the biggest populations of medical professionals in this country.”</p>



<p>For Briones, the importance of this visibility hit home during the very first moments of the series. “It was really exciting once I learned that there were two Filipino nurses,” she reflects. “In the first five minutes of episode one, they’re speaking Tagalog. It brought me to tears the first time I saw it.”</p>



<p>That emotional connection to the script wasn’t accidental, it started through Briones’ own advocacy. When she was first cast, the production knew they wanted an Asian doctor, but the specifics of her heritage were still unknown. When she saw the initial name assigned to her character, she knew it didn’t fit.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>I saw it as a chance to represent my heritage along with Filipino people in healthcare in a small way by changing [Dr. Santos’s] name.</p><cite>Isa Briones</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>That “small” change resulted in Dr. Trinity Santos, a name that resonates with the Filipino community. “Even though it’s small, it’s still impactful,” Briones explains. “I’ve talked to a lot of Filipino nurses and doctors who are just like, ‘Yeah, we never see ourselves even though we are such a big part of this community.’ It feels very cathartic to be represented and to see the beauty of it.”</p>







<p>Briones was also determined to showcase the joy and the specialised competence of her community, from the high-stakes life-saving to the quiet, cultural textures of the workplace.<br /><br />“We have the funny scenes of the nurses having their gossip time, but also seeing just competent Filipino doctors and nurses is really important,” she says.”A lot of the Filipino nurses that are here in this country are doctors back home. Getting to show that experience is really beautiful.”<br /><br />Since its debut, <em>The Pitt</em> has carved out a space as a raw, unfiltered, and deeply real look at the American healthcare system. Season 1 didn’t just show us the hospital; it threw us into the deep end of a high-stakes, 15-hour shift. We watched as the staff’s resilience was pushed to a breaking point in an intense finale that left us in absolute shock. </p>



<p>“The stakes feel so much higher this time,” Briones notes, leaning into the shift for the newest season. “Because the world is already established, we’re hitting the ground running. Everything feels way more personal.”</p>



<p>What we do know is that Season 2 is doubling down on the grit, with even more gore and high-octane drama than before. Picking up ten months after the finale, the story unfolds over a chaotic Fourth of July weekend proving that in this hospital, there’s no such thing as a holiday.</p>



<p>“I think you’re going to see some cracks in the armour for Santos,” Isa explains. “It’s an actor’s dream to play someone that the audience loves to hate, but this season we get to see what’s underneath that defence mechanism. I just want people to feel something viscerally.”<br /><br /><strong><em>Season 2 of The Pitt premieres on January 8th on HBO MAX </em></strong></p>

<p>Just in time for the cozy, chilly months, NYX launched a cool brown beauty staple: its Suede Matte Lip Liner in <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyxcosmetics.com%2Flip%2Flip-liner%2Fsuede-matte-lip-liner%2FNYX_355.html%3Fdwvar_NYX__355_color%3DOG-Brew&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fnyx-og-brew-paloma-sanchez-collaboration"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">OG Brew</a>. If it sounds familiar, it’s because the new lip liner is a reimagining of its original formula for the consumer-favorite <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyxcosmetics.com%2Flip%2Flip-liner%2Fsuede-matte-lip-liner%2FNYX_355.html%3Fdwvar_NYX__355_color%3DCold%2520Brew&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fnyx-og-brew-paloma-sanchez-collaboration"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cold Brew</a>. So when OG Brew hit shelves on January 3, it sold out in five hours. And fans of the beauty essential have one particular person to thank for its return: <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@whor3chata_?lang=en"">Paloma Sanchez</a>.</p>



<p>Since September 2024, the beauty content creator has been grieving the loss of her favorite lip liner. At the time, she, like countless consumers, took to TikTok to share that something was up with the cosmetic staple. Cold Brew’s formula update shifted the color tone and texture of the original cool-brown color and creamy finish. And the Mexican creator hilariously (and very seriously) never got over the switch-up. For more than a year, she <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@whor3chata_/video/7430624151150365994"">lamented the formula change</a>, testing hundreds of luxury and drug-store lip liners in an attempt to replace her beloved original Cold Brew, but she never quite found any product that matched it.</p>



<p>“When I set out to find my ideal lip liner, I discovered Cold Brew and it immediately stood out. I loved how it looked on my complexion and how effortlessly it worked with so many different lip products. It was also affordable without sacrificing performance, which made it even more special,” Sanchez tells Refinery29 Somos. “Cold Brew was genuinely one of the only lip liners I used, so when I repurchased it, I immediately knew something had changed.”</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953806.png?width=1024&amp;height=716&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=256%3A179"" /></figure></div>



<p>Sanchez noticed that the texture of the lip liner was drier and the shade had a tint of warm orange. So she did what 20-somethings are increasingly doing when a product doesn’t quite meet their expectations: she shared her thoughts online. Except, she had an audience of hundreds of thousands — and many of them felt the same. </p>



<p>“I made the video out of pure sadness and frustration after realizing a product I truly loved had changed so drastically,” she says. “As someone who is very passionate about product development, I had a genuine curiosity about why such a staple, affordable product would be altered in such a way.”</p>



<p>Her first video, Part 1 of now 28 attempts of finding a dupe of NYX’s Cold Brew, went up on TikTok on September 28, 2024 and has more than 190,800 likes and hundreds of comments from folks who echoed her calls for NYX to bring back the original formula. </p>



<p>“I did not expect the reaction it received. I was simply sharing an honest emotional response, and it clearly resonated with people,” Sanchez says.</p>



<p>The humorous episodic videos eventually got the attention of Tracy Allen, NYX Professional Makeup’s Director of Global Product Development. “We always strive to bring you the very best,” Allen tells Somos. “Sometimes, our products need a little update, whether it’s because certain ingredients are banned or discontinued, or we’ve moved to a new manufacturing home. While we aim for perfection, unfortunately, these updates can occasionally lead to slight variations in shade or texture.” </p>



<p>But as Sanchez’s dupe-search videos went viral, Allen’s team noticed that not everyone was a fan of some of the changes, and they tuned in to Sanchez’s year-long series to hear what she and her audience missed about the original lip liner. A year later, in 2025, Allen and her team invited Sanchez to work with them on a new product launch: the OG Brew. Sanchez headed to the NYX Professional Makeup headquarters in El Segundo, California, with the tiny remains of her original Cold Brew lip liner and worked with product developers to carefully test and assess various swatches until landing on a shade she loved. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953803.png?width=796&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=199%3A256"" /></figure></div>



<p>That lip liner, OG Cold Brew, is out now, and if you ask the girls on TikTok, Sanchez and NYX delivered. “NYX Cold Brew is so back,” one creator said. “Everyone, let’s go say thank you to Paloma,” another added.</p>



<p>The collaboration is the latest in a growing trend of brands responding to creator feedback on specific beauty formulas. In May of 2025, Beauty Crop Cosmetics teamed up with creator <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@itsurgrlaisha_?lang=en"">Aisha Asunramu</a> to co-design a lip kit after the latter voiced a need for shades tailored to deeper tones. Later that year, Tower 28 worked with TikToker <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@bonitravo?lang=en"">Toni Bravo</a> to co-create two high-pigment powder blush shades after the creator also stressed the need for shades for people with deeper skin tones.</p>



<p>It’s clear that beauty brands don’t just hear social media feedback, some of them also listen, even inviting everyday experts (the consumers!) into their headquarters to create products their shoppers actually want.</p>



<p>“We love our community. At NYX, your voice truly matters to us, which is why we are constantly referencing your social media content and reviews throughout our development process to create products you’ll love,” Allen tells Somos. “When Paloma called out a visible discrepancy in her favorite shade, we jumped at the chance to listen to her feedback and make things right.”</p>



<p>And now, beauty lovers can shop both NYX’s OG Brew and Cold Brew lip liners.</p>

From shielding skin from dry, cold weather to strengthening the skin barrier, proper hydration and moisture (which are two different things, both important: In layman's terms, hydration is more surface-level, lending an immediate softening, plumping effect to skin, while moisturizing locks in hydration via oils/butters to prevent evaporation.) is an essential step in your routine, and one worth investing in.<br /><br />I personally learned (the hard way, might I add) that neglecting moisturizer is honestly, one of the worst things you can do to your skin. As an acne-prone gal, I spent more years than I'd care to admit robbing my face of hydration in the hopes it would curb my breakouts, when in reality, it only exacerbated them since my sebum production skyrocketed as a result of dehydration.<br /><br />As beauty editors, we test hundreds of moisturizers a year, and as such, know a thing or two about the ones that actually work and the ones worth skipping.

Applying it feels like instant relief, thanks to a trifecta of moisturizing, hydrating ingredients. First up are ceramides, which act like glue between skin cells, keeping skin soft and healthy rather than rough and flaky. Then there’s shea butter, which dermatologists praise for its deeply moisturizing properties, alongside glycerin. Glycerin is both a humectant  (meaning it draws moisture into the skin) and an emollient, helping to keep that moisture locked in. Even though it’s a souped-up moisturizer, it never breaks me out. I must be on my fifth tub by now. <br /><br /><strong>The Inkey List</strong> Bio-Active Ceramide Repairing and Plumping Moisturizer, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fthe-inkey-list-bio-active-ceramide-repairing-plumping-moisturizer-P509315"">Sephora</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1918"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953779.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1534&amp;height=1918&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=767:959"" width=""1534"" /><figcaption><h2>U Beauty The Super Hydrator<br /></h2> <br />If you’re going to invest in a high-end moisturizer, make it this one. In winter, cleansing my skin can leave it feeling so tight and rough it’s as though it might crack, but when I use this consistently, that never happens. U Beauty promises hydration for up to 48 hours, and it’s all down to five sizes of hyaluronic acid molecules that hydrate every layer of the skin. It doesn’t stop there, though. Skin-strengthening peptides and smoothing shea butter support repair and deliver deep moisturization. Two pumps is enough to cover the entire face, and while it takes a moment to absorb, the glow is truly unrivaled. <br /><br /><strong>U Beauty</strong> The SUPER Hydrator, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fubeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-super-hydrator%3Fvariant%3D32599731994724"">U Beauty</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1426"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953785.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1426&amp;height=1426&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1426"" /><figcaption><h2>First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair® Cream Intense Hydration <br /></h2><br />For very dry skin, it has to be First Aid’s Ultra Repair Cream.

Beneath the simple packaging, it feels and performs just like a high-end moisturizer. I’d expect nothing less — it’s Korean, after all. This cream cocoons dry, dehydrated, and sensitive skin with ceramides, which act like scaffolding to reinforce the skin barrier without leaving a greasy residue.

It’s more of a lotion than a thick cream, but don’t underestimate it. A blend of hydrating hyaluronic acid, antioxidant-rich grape water, and soothing chamomile extract is complemented by nourishing glycerin and shea butter. Even though it’s packed with all the goof stuff, I find it sinks in quickly, leaving behind a hint of dew. Even better, it’s non-comedogenic, so it’s unlikely to clog pores. <br /><br /><strong>Caudalie</strong> VinoHydra Sorbet Cream Moisturizer, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fcaudalie-vinohydra-sorbet-cream-moisturizer-with-hyaluronic-acid-P472454%3F"">Sephora</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1080"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953792.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1080&amp;height=1080&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1080"" /><figcaption><h2>Vichy Minéral 89 100H Rich Cream Fragrance-Free<br /></h2><br />I’ve lost count of how many dermatologists have told me they rely on this cream; it’s often one of the first they mention when I ask for recommendations for dry skin. It sits in a comfortable space between a lightweight lotion and a rich face mask, spreading easily and quenching skin instantly.

(That’s not a riddle — it’s just this cream.) Beauty director Jacqueline — who has acne-prone skin — always has a tub of this on hand for sub-zero temperatures. “It’s the only thing that quenches my parched skin without triggering breakouts.

It makes my skin gleam without appearing oily.” <br /><br /><strong>Tatcha</strong> Chilli Oil on Everything 250ml Pourer Jar, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tatcha.com%2Fproduct%2Fdewy-skin-cream-replenishing-and-plumping-moisturizer%2FCA06310T.html%3F"">Tatcha</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1080"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953315.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1080&amp;height=1080&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1080"" /><figcaption><h2>BeautyStat Universal Pro-Bio Moisture Boost Cream</h2><br />This cushiony cream from cosmetic chemist Ron Robinson's beloved brand, BeautyStat, is perfect for sensitive skin types since it has biofermented reishi mushroom extract and a ceramide-powered complex to deliver soothing moisture that lasts. <br /><br /><strong>BeautyStat Cosmetics</strong> Probiotic 24HR Moisture Boost Cream Moisturizer, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fprobiotic-24hr-moisture-boost-cream-moisturizer-pimprod2030151%3Fsku%3D2594546"">Ulta Beauty</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952690.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p>Until a few weeks ago, I was faithfully using a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tretinoin-skin-benefits-risks"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">prescription retinoid</a> recommended by a trusted dermatologist — and my skin had never looked worse. My first mistake was assuming that, having <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glow-recipe-blackberry-retinol-blemish-serum-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">used retinol before</a>, I wouldn’t experience the harsh side effects of a stronger formula. But when my skin wouldn’t stop peeling, my breakouts got worse, and I was almost out of the tube, I knew something was off. So when The Inkey List’s new <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fadvanced-retinol-us-P520381%3F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Advanced 0.2% Retinal</a> landed on my desk, promising a fast yet gentle experience for retinoid users, I knew I had to give it a try. </p>



<h2>What is The Inkey List’s Advanced 0.2% Retinal, and what are the benefits? </h2>



<p>Without getting all lab-coat on you (and before I get into the nitty gritty), it helps to know the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">difference between retin<em>al</em> </a>— the star ingredient in The Inkey List’s new serum — and retin<em>ol</em>. Both are members of the retinoid family, but they work a little differently.  </p>



<p>Esthetician <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/alicia.lartey/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Alicia Lartey</a> previously explained to R29 that when retinol is applied to the skin, it <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">goes through several steps</a> before being converted into retinoic acid, which triggers all the amazing skin benefits, like improving texture and tone, minimizing fine lines by boosting collagen production, and reducing breakouts by renewing skin cells. Retinal, on the other hand, requires fewer steps to become retinoic acid, so it works faster — 11 times faster, according to The Inkey List. It’s the retinal that gives this serum its striking yellow color, but don’t worry — it hasn’t gone bad, and though it’s a little reminiscent of a turmeric face mask, it absorbs instantly and won’t stain your skin. I can vouch for that.  </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fadvanced-retinol-us-P520381"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Inkey List Advanced 0.2% Retinal Serum, $15</a></h2>

<h2>What makes The Inkey List’s Advanced 0.2 Retinal special? </h2>



<p>Even better, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP520381"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Inkey List’s retinal</a> is encapsulated, meaning it’s wrapped in tiny moisturizing molecules that release it gradually into the skin. This way, you get all the benefits of a high-powered ingredient with far less irritation — no soreness or painfully dry, flaky patches here.  </p>



<p>Just when I thought this product couldn’t get any smarter, it also features 1% symsitive, a soothing ingredient that supports the skin barrier (the outer layer that keeps moisture in and bacteria out). This is a relief, as retinoids can easily damage the skin barrier if used incorrectly or too often. Plus, there’s 2% sirtalice, an algae-derived ingredient that helps firm the skin in minutes, making it appear juicy and plump.  </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>What to know about The Inkey List’s 0.2% Advanced Retinal serum</h3>



<p>— Features 0.2% encapsulated retinal, a high-strength ingredient that works faster than retinol with minimal irritation. </p>



<p>— Targets dark spots, rough skin texture, fine lines, and breakouts. </p>



<p>— Designed for evening use: two to three times a week at first. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>How do you use The Inkey List’s Advanced 0.2 Retinal, and is it worth it?  </h2>



<p>I’ve been using <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP520381"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Advanced 0.2% Retinal</a> for a few weeks now (a pea-sized amount three nights a week, right after cleansing and before a simple moisturizer), and my skin is already much happier. It’s clearer, bouncier, smoother in texture, and more even in tone, thanks to the retinal helping minimize the red marks left behind by breakouts. Here, I’m wearing a light touch of concealer and blush, and can comfortably skip foundation.</p>



<p>With my skin feeling less dry, the fine lines under my eyes and across my forehead have eased up, too. I even bring it down my neck to help zap the occasional hormonal zit. My neck is the first place to feel sensitive when I use retinoids because the skin is thinner here, but so far, I’ve not experienced any irritation. </p>



<p>It’s a lightweight serum, so you’ll want to make sure the moisturizer you apply on top in the evening is fairly simple and doesn’t contain high-strength actives like exfoliating acids. Good options include <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fsos-daily-skin-barrier-redness-recovery-moisturizer-P506470"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tower 28 SOS Daily Skin Barrier Redness Recovery Moisturizer</a> or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fthe-ordinary-deciem-natural-moisturizing-factors-ha-P427414"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + Hyaluronic Acid</a>. I’m also a fan of <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fthe-inkey-list-bio-active-ceramide-repairing-plumping-moisturizer-P509315"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Inkey List’s Bio-Active Ceramide Repairing and Plumping Moisturizer</a>. </p>





<p>My top tip for anyone using this serum is to continue using a high-factor, broad-spectrum sunscreen in the daytime because retinoids make skin more sensitive to sunlight. Yep, even in the fall and winter months. </p>



<p>You can always count on The Inkey List not to leave anyone out, and there’s good news for retinoid beginners, too. Alongside its buzzy new retinal, the brand has also unveiled a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fstarter-retinol-us-P520372"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Starter Retinol Serum</a>, just as affordable at $14. With 1% granactive retinoid (a gentler, also encapsulated form) and 0.01% retinal, it’s kinder on sensitive skin — even for those with rosacea — thanks to additional soothing ingredients like glycerin and symrelief 100 (made from chamomile and ginger root). While it’s pretty new, the five-star reviews speak for themselves. </p>

<h2>Best Work Tote Bags</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953190.png?width=806&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=403%3A512"" /></figure>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-tote-bags"">Tote bags</a> have cemented their status as a standout choice for work, and for good reason. The spacious style can carry so much, and, when designed for work, have extra compartments, pockets, pouches, and zippers to help organize your belongings. We’re partial to leather totes because of their chicness and longevity, but less expansive alternatives like nylon and polyester make a case for durability. Whether you opt for a boxy or bucket shape, any of these options will surely become your go-to work companion.  </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Best Work Laptop Bags</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953203.png?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>If you really mean business, opt for a laptop bag with handy dividers, sleeves, and compartments. From totes to briefcases, these designs keep <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-designers-fashion-technology"">your tech</a> secure, your accessories perfectly organized, and your on-the-go style sharp. (Many are also available in multiple sizes to fit 13-inch or 16-inch laptops.)  </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Best Work Designer Bags</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953220.png?width=731&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=731%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Looking to get a work bag that’ll last you many years to come? It may be worth investing in a luxe leather style from a designer brand. From Polène’s bestselling Cyme sculptural bag to Mansur Gavriel’s signature <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mansur-gavriel-candy-bag-review-promo-code-deal"">Candy hobo bag</a>, some iconic handbags prove they’re very versatile and can be worn from work to dinner. Seek out oversized styles, high-quality leather, and sturdy straps to ensure you’re getting the most bang for your buck.  </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Best Work Backpacks</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953240.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-lululemon-bags-belt-crossbody-tote-duffle"">Backpacks</a> are our top pick for city commuters, but they don’t have to feel blah or grade-school-inspired. Consider tried-and-true, water-repellant (and washable!) fabrics in streamlined designs or more sophisticated pebbled leather and quilted fabrics to upgrade your look. Features like adjustable shoulder straps, metal hardware, laptop sleeves, and water bottle pockets are the cherry on top of a commuter-friendly and work-appropriate backpack. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Best Work Travel Bag</h2>

<p>When it comes to business trips, bags with suitcase sleeves are a must. And these zippered options — from oversized totes to mini duffle bags — combine organized interiors with travel-smart features, like water-repellant fabrics and tons of compartments. Ideal for navigating terminals and heading straight to meetings, these travel work bags are the perfect blend of style and functionality. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Best Work Top-Handle Bags</h2>

<p>Channel the sophistication of the ’30s to ’60s with structured top-handle bags, curved (trendy) bowling bags, or slim briefcases that blend vintage charm with modern refinement. And thankfully, many of these styles come with detachable straps so you can also wear them as shoulder and crossbody bags. </p>
