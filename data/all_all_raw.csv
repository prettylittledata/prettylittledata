<p>Laoyuting Pavilion is one of the invited projects of the 2024 Dianchi Art Season: ""Home and Future"". It is located on the southern side of the Water-Forest Art Zone in the Laoyu River Wetland Park at Dianchi Lake. After its completion, it first served as the entrance to the Dianchi Art Festival, and after the festival, the pavilion was permanently preserved as a spatial hint for entering the wetland park, as well as a resting place for visitors. This wetland, filled with groves of bald cypress along the edge of Dianchi Lake, is in fact part of the city's water-purification infrastructure—the final stage of natural filtration before water enters the lake. It is home to many small fish, and city dwellers often come here during leisure time to catch fish, hence the name Laoyu River Wetland. As a pavilion where people rest while fishing, it naturally came to be known as the Laoyuting Pavilion.</p>",

<p>This week's news reflects architecture's simultaneous engagement with cultural reflection, professional legacy, and the material realities of building cities. The passing of<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/frank-gehry""> Frank Gehry</a> prompted a broader reassessment of late 20th- and early 21st-century architectural practice, while<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1036740/shigeru-ban-named-recipient-of-the-2026-aia-gold-medal""> Shigeru Ban's selection as the recipient of the 2026 AIA Gold Medal</a> brought renewed attention to socially driven design and the profession's public responsibilities. These milestones unfolded alongside wider conversations sparked by<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1036816/on-human-rights-day-perspectives-on-architecture-equity-housing-access-and-safety-worldwide""> Human Rights Day, examining architecture's role in equity, housing access, and safety worldwide</a>, and forward-looking discussions setting the architectural agenda for 2026 through major international events and cultural programs. At the scale of the built environment, these themes are echoed in three projects shaping future urban conditions:<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/office/powerhouse-company""> Powerhouse Company</a>'s transformation of a former limestone quarry into a mixed-use neighbourhood in Bærum, near<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/oslo""> Oslo</a>; the groundbreaking of Riverside Wharf, a hospitality-led development contributing to the regeneration of<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/miami""> Miami</a>'s River District; and<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/office/foster-plus-partners""> Foster + Partners</a>' approved retrofit of 1 St James's Square in<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/london""> London</a>, focused on structural retention and long-term urban resilience.</p>",

<p><em>Environmental architecture with reference to grapevine trellises </em>– <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/yamanashi"">Yamanashi</a> is surrounded by various mountains such as Mt. Fuji, one of Japan's representative mountains, and is one of the few inland basins in the island nation of Japan. With long hours of sunshine, low annual precipitation, large daily temperature differences, and abundant water resources, grape cultivation has flourished in the region since ancient times, and today, grape trellises weave across the landscape.</p>",

<p>FEZH reinterprets the spatial logic of Fes El Bali, where clustered dwellings form the foundation of an organic urban fabric. Drawing from this precedent, the project aspires to create a ""minimal urban unit"" that consolidates essential communal functions for healing, culture, and everyday life. Within the gentle alleyways of Hannam-dong, FEZH positions itself as a compact city—an intersection of architecture, nature, and human experience—embodying its name, which merges Fez, Healing, and Hannam-dong.</p>",

<p>An off-grid cottage on a forested peninsula combines natural materials with elevated living spaces amid the trees. Located on a secluded peninsula along a pristine, motorboat-free lake in the Ontario wilderness, this off-grid retreat offers a serene escape for an urban couple with a deep love of nature—who spent weekends camping on the land for a year before deciding where and what to build. Their goal: a place deeply connected to nature, elevated among the trees, and designed to accommodate accessible multigenerational living—a welcoming year-round refuge for gathering with family and friends.</p>",

<p>Every year brings new ideas, projects, and shifts in architectural culture, but it also marks the loss of voices that have shaped the discipline across decades. <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/architecture"">Architecture</a> moves forward, but it also advances through absence. When figures who helped articulate its language and its ambitions disappear, they leave behind more than completed works or influential texts. Their absence becomes a threshold, a moment in which the discipline pauses to understand what remains, what evolves, and what continues to guide us. These moments of loss remind us that architecture is a long, collective construction, carried not only by those shaping the present but also by those whose visions continue to orient how we think about cities and landscapes.</p>",

<h3><strong>Are you designing for the user’s values — or your own?</strong></h3><h4>The future of design will be the negotiation between multiple moral worlds.</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*rAPqyo-0EgOK8hmB"" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=""https://unsplash.com/@vincefleming?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Vince Fleming</a> on <a href=""https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>It’s not a stretch to suggest that as technology becomes more omnipresent, the designer’s role will shift from “hands-on” making to shaping how humanity interacts with machines. We will evolve from designing screens to defining moral guardrails. And like any profession with the power to influence lives — doctors, lawyers, policymakers — designers will need a strong foundation in ethics.</p><p>This is the core reason I developed the<a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html""> Five Pillars of Ethical Interface Design</a> — an evolving framework I actively invite other designers to engage with and offer feedback on. The pillars are meant to push designers to confront the moral weight of their decisions rather than hide behind aesthetics, heuristics, or empathy theater.</p><p>The truth is designers rarely operate from a neutral position. Even when they insist they’re “designing for the user,” their own <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/230538.230561"">assumptions, values, and biases</a> inevitably slip into the work — usually without them noticing.</p><p>This is mainly due to what can be described as ethical misalignment — the gap between the user values designers think they’re honoring and the internal values that actually shape their decisions.</p><p>One of the main drivers of this misalignment is the industry’s habit of treating empathy as a stand-in for values — and sometimes as permission to slip personal priorities into the work.</p><p>Designers start assuming that a superficial understanding what someone experiences automatically tells them what should matter. It’s a comforting belief. It’s also wrong.</p><p>As <a href=""https://medium.com/thinking-design/why-i-dont-believe-in-empathic-design-c3dd0a956de9"">Don Norman has argued</a>, designers can’t actually have empathy in any literal sense — we can only observe behavior and imagine internal states. And imagination is unreliable.</p><p>The worst example of this is applying empathy before actual research occurs—projection masquerading as insight. We all do this, and it feels like basic human decency, but it can be dangerous to assume you know what another individual experiences or what their values actually are.</p><p>Empathy clarifies what a user experiences, but it does not tell you which experience should matter more. It doesn’t decide which trade-offs are acceptable, or how to weigh one user’s needs against another’s. Those choices come from values, not empathy. Empathy describes—values prescribe.</p><p>The moment real trade-offs appear, empathy gives way to the team’s own values. What looks like “designing for the user” often becomes designing for an imagined one — whether that means stripping out granular controls because the team prefers simplicity over user sovereignty, or slowing down a flow because they assume older users aren’t technically capable when many are power users in reality. In both cases, the decision reflects the team’s worldview, not the user’s.</p><h4><strong>How designer values sneak into the interface</strong></h4><p>It shouldn’t be surprising that everyone’s moral compass points in different directions. Flip between Fox and CNN for thirty seconds and you’ll see two completely different moral realities presented as fact.</p><p>Just as news outlets present competing realities, <a href=""https://monoskop.org/images/8/8c/Winner_Langdon_1980_Do_Artifacts_Have_Politics.pdf"">designers construct realities too</a> — every interface carries an implicit stance about what should matter. For example, when <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html#inclusion"">inclusion</a> rises to the top of a designer’s priorities, the user experience naturally becomes more nuanced. Accommodating a wider range of needs often softens the straightforward simplicity a majority audience might expect.</p><p>If <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html#wellbeing"">well-being</a> dominates, the pattern shifts again. Efficient or engaging features get softened or buried to reduce compulsion. That may feel responsible inside the team, but it frustrates users who value speed, momentum, or freedom.</p><p>And when <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html#transparency"">transparency</a> becomes the user’s priority, the tension flips. Instead of overwhelming people with disclosures, teams may hide or compress information to preserve a clean, frictionless flow. It satisfies an internal bias for elegance, but it leaves users with less clarity and less agency.</p><p>These types of choices rarely come directly from user research. They come from the ethics of the team itself — values that quietly harden into the architecture of the product.</p><h4>Why explicit ethical structures matter</h4><p>Ethical value tensions show up in nearly every product decision, yet the industry still struggles to confront them explicitly. <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/242485.242493"">Batya Friedman’s <em>Value Sensitive Design</em></a> (VSD), developed decades ago, was one of the first efforts to systematize this concept. It provided a structured way to examine which human values ought to guide technology — from the conceptual level to empirical research to technical implementation.</p><p>However, <a href=""https://vsdesign.org/vsd/"">VSD</a> has not gained widespread adoption in industry, largely because it skews more towards an academic framework rather than a practical tool designers could apply directly to everyday product decisions.</p><p><a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html"">My framework</a> aims to fill that gap. It offers a more usable system while also addressing a different blind spot — what happens when the team’s stated values and the user’s lived values drift apart once those values are expressed in the interface itself.</p><p>But before we can make ethical decisions, we need to understand the user’s values with precision. That’s why I’ve started to develop a simple Ethical Interface Design evaluation tool to sit alongside the Five Pillars of Ethical Interface Design framework.</p><p>The tool uses a <a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Uj4fi7SP9sUYVu2qbgeW0Tvy2hPAGeg9C1t00D57DrI/preview"">short 10-question survey</a>. For each of the <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html"">five pillars</a> (inclusion, autonomy, transparency, privacy, and well-being), users answer two prompts: one that captures their ethical preference — how important that pillar is to them — and another that evaluates how well the product currently delivers on that value, each rated from 1 to 5.</p><p>Together, the five pillars and the evaluation tool are not about prescribing which values you should hold. They expose the gap between what users actually prefer and the moral defaults the product is quietly imposing. The math is simple:</p><p><strong>User preference (1–5) minus Product score (1–5) = Gap.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>0</strong> → aligned</li><li><strong>Negative</strong> → you’re not meeting the value the user actually wants</li><li><strong>Positive</strong> → you’re pushing a value harder than the user prefers</li></ul><p>The key to making <a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Uj4fi7SP9sUYVu2qbgeW0Tvy2hPAGeg9C1t00D57DrI/preview"">this survey</a> work is to implement questions that expose ethical design tradeoffs. For example, if we look at the <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html#transparency"">pillar of transparency</a> (note: these questions are still being refined):</p><figure><img alt=""Survey with two questions: one about preference for speed vs. explanations, the other about clarity of product explanations. Each has five radio button options."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/645/1*pKf-yFEXGBVfbFlTUOTbMg.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot from Ethical Interface Design Evaluation</figcaption></figure><p>Across a group of users, the patterns show you exactly where your design values match the audience — and where your own worldview is leaking into the interface.</p><h4>The ethical pivot point</h4><p>Technology is no longer just entertainment, utilities, or conveniences.<br />It mediates attention, communication, decisions, even identity. That makes every value baked into an interface more consequential. We’re not arranging screens anymore. We’re shaping the logic of human–machine interaction — and by extension, shaping behavior and culture.</p><p>By understanding user values through <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/index.html"">ethical design</a> frameworks and tools we can help designers see where their instincts, assumptions, and moral defaults are quietly overriding the people they’re designing for. Not to eliminate value tension — that’s impossible — but to recognize it and make trade-offs consciously instead of unconsciously.</p><p>Ethical design isn’t about being virtuous. It’s about being honest with yourself about the values you’re imposing.</p><p>And in the end, it comes down to one unavoidable question: <strong>Are you designing for the user’s values — or your own?</strong></p><h4><em>References</em></h4><ul><li>Bias in computer systems: <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/230538.230561"">https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/230538.230561</a></li><li>Why I Don’t Believe in Empathic Design: <a href=""https://medium.com/thinking-design/why-i-dont-believe-in-empathic-design-c3dd0a956de9"">https://medium.com/thinking-design/why-i-dont-believe-in-empathic-design-c3dd0a956de9</a></li><li>Value-Sensitive Design: <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/242485.242493"">https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/242485.242493</a></li><li>Do Artifacts Have Politics?: <a href=""https://monoskop.org/images/8/8c/Winner_Langdon_1980_Do_Artifacts_Have_Politics.pdf"">https://monoskop.org/images/8/8c/Winner_Langdon_1980_Do_Artifacts_Have_Politics.pdf</a></li></ul><p><strong><em>Don’t miss out! </em></strong><a href=""https://micbuckcreative.medium.com/subscribe""><strong><em>Join my email list</em></strong></a><strong><em> and receive the latest content.</em></strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=11ee5268dff2"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/are-you-designing-for-the-users-values-or-your-own-11ee5268dff2"">Are you designing for the user’s values — or your own?</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>How the UX of AI chat can hijack our brains to compromise learning in schools and beyond</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qtcduS2L6Kv_ya_WyZXauw.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://unsplash.com/photos/people-sitting-on-chair-with-brown-wooden-table-mlVbMbxfWI4"">Unsplash image by Luis Villasmil</a>. Modified the text on stickies with Nano Banana.</figcaption></figure><p>Ask any instructor what helps students learn, and it’s unlikely any of them will answer “a really big wall of text”. It’s incredible to me, as both a university instructor and a UX designer, that the army of people working at OpenAI are not imagining better tools for our students. I want to walk you through a design pattern in ChatGPT that, despite its good intentions, might be creating unintended hurdles for students.</p><p>I’m talking about “<a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07858v1"">verbosity compensation</a>”, which is an LLM’s tendency to provide overly wordy answer.</p><p>We’ve all seen it. You ask for help, and the AI provides a dense, multi-part response, that sounds like high-quality until you look closer. The challenge for learning specifically, is that managing the learner’s cognitive load is critical, and presenting information this way can be overwhelming. It’s a bit like asking how to boil an egg and getting the entire science of how water boils, the protein structure of an egg, and two egg salad recipes in response.</p><p>Let’s dive into ChatGPT’s “Study and Learn” mode with both our cognitive science and UX design lenses. By the end of the article, I’ll explore potential interface ideas that could help with learning.</p><h3>All the steps at once</h3><p>To start, I used a simple, real-world prompt from a student: “I want to learn about Montreal’s role in the fur trade in shaping Canada’s history for an essay.”</p><p>You can see in the response below how heavy the answer is compared to the request. Yes, the student didn’t do a good job being specific, but as non-experts we should expect that they won’t always know.</p><figure><img alt=""A ChatGPT response with many bullets and follow-up recommendations"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*g46CoGaiV6Ziwd9D"" /></figure><p>When I broke down the response, I saw it was trying to do four things at once: ask the students’ grade, provide facts, suggest an essay structure, and ask if the student wanted to continue.</p><p>However not all of these are immediately appropriate when a student comes in with an uncertain request. To make this easier to follow, let’s give each part of the answer a name so we can analyze them more closely:</p><ol><li>Requirements gathering</li><li>Additional context</li><li>Structure recommendation</li><li>Task confirmation</li></ol><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*8zQeQqSagGlyZqvL"" /></figure><p>Now as UX designers, you know how important it is to structure steps to avoid overwhelming the users. It’s the reason why wizards and screen-by-screen flows are used in any task that requires multiple levels of user reflection, input, and confirmation.</p><p>Below I highlighted how each of these four steps has different expectations from the user, from needing user input to simply informing them.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YHUr9-2N_QeiwTKufdrq8Q.png"" /></figure><p>Let’s compare the ChatGPT response, with an Amazon checkout flow to highlight this gap. Looking at the screens below, notice how each step has a discrete action requested from the customer, and <em>just enough</em> information for the customer to make an informed decision.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*S51LfN5lx688hmPu"" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=""https://www.shaheermalik.com/blog/amazon-checkout-process-ux-design-case-study"">UX Case Amazon’s Checkout Process: UX Design Case Study 2024</a></figcaption></figure><p>Now imagine if the the entire Amazon checkout process was converted into a similar ChatGPT wall of text. It would be both confusing and would open a lot of room for error (or manipulation, depending on your worldview).</p><p>Customers would have to pay attention to things like credit card details, addresses, the order’s exact name, and the price, all in one shot. Would you feel comfortable answering the chatbot below to go ahead with the purchase?</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*I0er-5Un_8aYs-Aj"" /></figure><h3>Friction is necessary in learning</h3><p>In the Amazon example above, the biggest problem is that the friction from trying to read all that text, and it breaks several of the classic <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/#poster"">10 usability heuristics</a>. We can agree, quite easily, that this is not an optimal way to help users buy a product from Amazon.</p><p>However, the simplification of a checkout flow into steps is primarily to reduce errors. When it comes to learning, sometimes simplification can be a way to add <em>necessary friction</em> to improve learning outcomes.</p><p>Take a look at the <strong>Additional context</strong> that ChatGPT provides as a second step. It opens that bulleted list with “To get us started,” despite the the paragraph right before explicitly saying “Before we dig in.”</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sLET8jccMblJT61u_QVM-Q.png"" /></figure><p>This is troubling because the LLM almost had an opportunity to stop after <strong>Requirements gathering</strong> to allow the students time to provide more information and reflect on their needs. If it wasn’t for the incessant push to please users with easy answers, ChatGPT might have been a good tool for this kind of deeper introspection.</p><p>Instead, in providing all four of these steps in one answers, the LLM is inadvertently making it incredibly easy for the student to bypass the entire point of writing an essay. Finding relevant context and structuring an argument are the richest part of writing an assignment. If we care about the <em>content</em> of an essay and not just the <em>form</em>, the student needs to understand how to pick the right research and where to place it for a coherent point to be made.</p><p>Below you can see how ChatGPT first asks them for more details, automatically does research for them, provides a structure, and finally then asks them if they’d like to be walked through each step.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Dq4aIgz0BIC1-H7tqVqAtA.png"" /></figure><p>The unintended result is a path of least resistance that lets students bypass the very process of learning. And when a student is facing a deadline, that path is understandably tempting.</p><p>So I did what a busy student might do: I took the AI’s follow-up question as a helpful nudge. I ignored the first question about my grade and simply replied “yes” to the last one. ChatGPT, happy to oblige, did exactly what all instructors are dreading so much.</p><p>It began providing “guiding questions,” which aren’t bad at face value, but this is where ChatGPT’s verbosity compensation surprised me with a problem I didn’t expect. <strong>It often provides the answer within the question itself.</strong></p><p>For example, it asks, “What geographical features made Montreal ideal as a trading hub?” and then immediately adds, “A key point is the strategic location.”</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*5QdtMBw6t6nGUTqD"" /><figcaption>Red and blue show how questions one and two are answered only bullet points apart.</figcaption></figure><p>This essentially turns the task from a critical thinking prompt into a ‘fill-in-the-blanks’ exercise. The kind of activity that is less likely to build long-term understanding, essentially rendering such assignments into a charade of the original intention.</p><h3>Breaking the consistency needed for good UX</h3><p>The last point before we get into the solutions is how the very nature of LLMs break’s one of the golden rules for good UX: consistent behaviors to the same user actions.</p><p>This is a significant challenge for any educator trying to use this tool in a classroom. Both because students might independently get very different quality of support, and because any prompting tips provided by the teacher might not always work as intended.</p><p>I ran the exact same prompt three times and received three very different learning paths.</p><ul><li>One gave a full essay structure.</li><li>Another asked me to choose a focus (a more effective approach).</li><li>The third invited me to reflect on the topic myself (even better for learning).</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*eSEFPY0rjHS6WvqNVrRTJg.png"" /></figure><p>This inconsistency makes it difficult to rely on the tool for structured educational activities. It’s a tough design problem to solve, because it’s the foundation of how LLMs generate answers. But if we want to make tools where teachers and students can align on how to make them work, then we have much better chances of creating effective AI learning strategies for students. It’s crucial for creating a trustworthy learning environment.</p><p>So, what’s the opportunity? We can design for deeper learning.</p><h3>Designing with scaffolding and deeper learning</h3><p>As a designer, this is the part that gets me excited. We have a huge opportunity to build something even more effective. Instead of a single text dump, imagine an interface that uses scaffolding, guiding a student one intentional step at a time.</p><p>It could start by only asking for the student’s needs.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*DN6nn_D-C-K_0AEB"" /></figure><p>From there, it could introduce different essay types, explaining the pros and cons of each. This transforms the interaction into a series of small, manageable learning moments. More importantly, any context it provides would no longer about the content of the essay, but rather about the type. This helps students make <em>informed decisions</em> and develop a deeper understanding of why they are doing what they’re doing.</p><p>The goal isn’t to stop giving students powerful tools, but to design those tools to foster better thinking habits.</p><p>In an ideal world, I’d even go as far as suggesting more visual ways for thinking with interactive cards that let students look at their different options and even let them explore the different pathways.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*yVugAxUVmRftf3-X"" /></figure><p>Why limit the answers to just text inputs and outputs? We’re slowly seeing research emerge that this kind of dynamic UI creation is possible with <a href=""https://research.google/blog/generative-ui-a-rich-custom-visual-interactive-user-experience-for-any-prompt/"">Google’s generative UI</a>. But even without fancy technology, we can use simple things like text fields, drop-downs, buttons, and lists or carousels to make the information easier to interact with.</p><h3>Moving towards LLMs made for learning</h3><p>I want to be clear that my deep dive on this UX is not simply about making more interactive components to help with learning. There are foundational differences in the ways we should be training LLMs for a learning context.</p><p>The best inspiration I’ve found on methods to approach this are people exploring concepts of “productive resistance” like Advait Sarkar. In his <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/advait_sarkar_how_to_stop_ai_from_killing_your_critical_thinking"">TED Talk</a>, towards he says the following about his research lab’s philosophy.</p><blockquote>“We take the position that the ability to think well is essential for human agency and empowerment and flourishing.”</blockquote><p>Instead, what we have today are machines that prioritize increasing our time spent using them, rather than maximizing the learning that can happen with them. And yet, I am hopeful because we are so early in the life of AI interfaces and the technology that the best innovations are yet to come.</p><p>There are so many opportunities for us, as designers to actually make this experience of studying with an AI something that changes education rather than continues to bypass the most important steps. If you are working in an educational setting on a project with a lot of opportunities for learning, I’ll end with a place that you can start your own learn.</p><p>Designers can become a lot more potent if we understand the human brain at a level much deeper than most design schools invite us to. Most of the time, the world of UX thinks of psychology as a list of cognitive biases and attention spans. But the brain is so much more interesting and incredible, and learning in and of itself is so much more than a function relegated to students at a school.</p><p>Instead, I invite you to start thinking of your work as something that can shape human cognition at levels that are far more subtle than what we’re used to with traditional interfaces. While in this example I explored the harm to students, these same shortcuts can impact anyone who’s trying to learn, collaborate, or create with AI.</p><p>Learning is one of the most fundamental functions of our intelligence. Perhaps now is the time for all of us working in technology to understand its mysteries a little more deeply. As we keep learning, we may soon discover the best techniques to build tools that, as Sarkar said, enable human agency, empowerment, and flourishing.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e4e7facde91e"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/chatgpt-talks-too-much-and-its-ruining-learning-e4e7facde91e"">ChatGPT talks too much and it’s ruining learning</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>How dark patterns are actually becoming legal liabilities</h4><figure><img alt=""Image of a big ol’ roach motel manager, representing Amazon"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*koghoada16AFTSMK8QZO2A.png"" /><figcaption>Image of a big ol’ roach motel manager, representing Amazon</figcaption></figure><p>With the holidays around the corner, I’ve been on an online shopping spree, and recently while on Amazon I stumbled upon a very disturbing trend. Right beside the item’s price, in bright red discount colours there’s a “–25%” discount text. Nothing particularly weird about that… except the “discounted” price was exactly the same as the price I’d seen a few days earlier. Using a price tracker, you can actually see that the listing was briefly restocked at a higher price purely to enable the 25% discount badge. The UI is screamin’ <em>you’re getting a bargain, you’d be silly not to grab it now</em>, while nothing has materially changed except my perception.</p><p>Back in the 1800s, shopping was more akin to a cat-and-mouse game, where prices were subjective and based on the individual shopkeeper’s whims. If demand picked up for a particular item, they could increase or discount. This all changed when a family known as the<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/28/opinion/dynamic-pricing-algorithms.html""> Quakers (of Quaker Oats fame) implemented what they called the “one price” option</a>. They started posting prices for things publicly, which allowed consumers to compare across stores, and that created a new kind of equilibrium and the humble price tag was born.</p><p>But in the age of the internet, the virtual shopkeepers have a lot more information to leverage against you. A thing called <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/100000010545598/dynamic-pricing-algorithms.html""><strong>dynamic pricing</strong></a>, the algorithmic reincarnation of old-school haggling, was invented. Explicitly designed to discover the highest price at which a sale can actually be made. As companies increasingly shared data and responded automatically to competitor listings, it has become easier than ever to keep prices in lockstep in favour of businesses and not consumers. These days, it’s not uncommon to find digital price tags updating in real time to match market conditions for optimal profit extraction. We’re back to fluid, opportunistic pricing, but now on steroids and supercharged by algorithms.</p><p>At the forefront of this new wild west of pricing and manipulation is Amazon. They use every method at their disposal to coax us into spending a few extra pennies, which when you have <a href=""https://amzscout.net/blog/amazon-statistics/"">310 million active users globally</a>, is not too shabby. Dark patterns: design choices that push people toward decisions that benefit the business at the user’s expense, are one of those tactics that I wanted to explore.</p><p>Amazon leans heavily on a pricing tactic known in consumer-protection circles as <a href=""https://competition-bureau.canada.ca/en/deceptive-marketing-practices/types-deceptive-marketing-practices/fake-sales-and-discounts""><strong>fake sales and discounts</strong></a> which essentially is inflating the “original” price so the current one looks like a bargain. In UX, this dark pattern doesn’t have an official name, though it clearly falls under interface interference and misdirection, but for the sake of this article, I’m gonna coin it <strong>Bezos Bargaining</strong>: the illusion of a “deal” created entirely through framing. Amazon presents a higher “list price,” your brain treats it as the baseline, so everything that follows feels like savings, even when nothing is actually being discounted.</p><figure><img alt=""Image showing the fake discount beside the listing price of the Amazon Fire TV’s"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/632/0*qdgUqliSGngbC51j.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.classaction.org/news/amazon-touted-fake-sale-prices-for-fire-tvs-class-action-suit-alleges"">Image showing the fake discount beside the listing price of the Amazon Fire TV’s</a></figcaption></figure><p>Recently, there was a <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/17/24247616/amazon-tricks-customers-into-buying-fire-tvs-with-fake-discounts-lawsuit-alleges"">class-action lawsuit</a>, where the plaintiffs showed that a bunch of Amazon products, including its own Fire TV, were advertised with massive markdowns even though they technically were just the “original” prices. <a href=""https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSPejLSgm/"">Price-tracking data even showed examples where the “sale” price was higher than what the product cost weeks earlier</a>.</p><p>Another of my fav’s is the classic <a href=""https://www.deceptive.design/types/hard-to-cancel""><strong>roach motel</strong></a>, which Amazon applied liberally to the Prime subscription flow. Aptly named after the exterminator trap, it’s easy to get in, nearly impossible to leave. It makes joining Prime seamless and canceling into an IQ and endurance test.</p><p>Signing up unintentionally is way too easy. At the checkout you’re presented with a giant, high-contrast button offering FREE delivery with Prime (often preselected by default). One click and you’re in a 30-day trial, whether you like it or not. Once you’re in, getting out becomes an odyssey. The cancellation flow forces you through a labyrinth, first a page asking you to “confirm,” then another urging you to pause instead and another warning you about the benefit’s you’ll lose, followed by the final, guilt-soaked screen offering a discounted rate if you stay. It’s a hall of mirrors designed to intentionally disorient. Just to add insult to injury, Amazon reportedly referred to this cancellation obstacle course as <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/21/amazon-prime-ftc-dark-patterns/""><strong>Project Iliad</strong></a>, named after the ancient epic about a war that took a decade to escape…</p><figure><img alt=""Image of one of the many screens in the Amazon Illyad cancellation flow showing all the ways their trying to make you stay"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*uxjXdMnGRWjMi2lq.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://stephen.fm/dark-patterns-in-the-wild-amazon-prime/"">Image of one of the many screens in the Amazon Illyad cancellation flow showing all the ways their trying to make you st</a></figcaption></figure><p>Recently Amazon lost a landmark case, because of this design strategy and we’re ordered to pay a staggering <a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-ftc-settlement-prime-dark-patterns/"">$2.5 billion settlement.</a> The largest consumer protection lawsuit in history, and it hinged on the well-known dark pattern Roach Motel. What makes this case historic isn’t the hefty dollar amount. It’s the precedent! For the first time at this scale, a court treated UI and UX decisions like button placement, flow ordering, default selections or the strategic use of friction as tools of deception. Dark patterns are officially becoming a legal liability!</p><p>Also, it’s important to acknowledge that these dark patterns, especially for large tech companies aren’t purely the responsibility of the designers. More often than not, the UX designer doesn’t get to cherry-pick the problems to solve and Amazon is famously data-driven. It’s easy to imagine how analytics could nudge a team towards a pattern like this. We’ve all been in grey zones, but that’s why one of the most useful things we can do is arm ourselves with strong arguments.</p><p>There’s a company called <a href=""https://www.fairpatterns.com/"">Fairpatterns</a>, a legal entity created specifically to build frameworks around deceptive design, and they make a compelling business case against dark patterns. The way they frame it isn’t just an ethical plea; they use business language. By saying that dark patterns are short-term optimizations with long-term costs. And while it might cause a spike in conversions for a quarter or two, it also might erode trust, reduce customer lifetime value and, as the latest Amazon case showed, expose you to legal risk.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*NggrkyjFFPLkMTk5.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.fairpatterns.com/post/amazons-2-5b-dark-patterns-settlement-what-all-e-retailers-must-change-now"">FairPatterns graphic showing the longterm consequences of using dark patterns</a></figcaption></figure><p>Their framing prompts us to ask stakeholders good questions like:</p><ul><li>What’s the cost of losing user trust?</li><li>How does unintentional retention affect lifetime value?</li><li>What are the risks of doing this to our brand’s equity?</li><li>and finally, even though unlikely, could this flow get us sued?</li></ul><p>And if the stick doesn’t work, there are always the carrots! It’s not a fact that every major corporation MUST use dark patterns. There are major companies that actually leverage their respect for their users as a sales strategy. Apple’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5&amp;v=vu3_01y4sLk&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fappleinsider.com%2Finside%2Fapple-and-privacy%3Futm_source%3Dchatgpt.com&amp;source_ve_path=MjM4NTE"">privacy initiatives</a> show how pro-user defaults can become strategic differentiators. Basecamp, for example, has spent years publicly advocating for opinionated, user-respecting design in their books <a href=""https://basecamp.com/books#rework"">Getting Real, REWORK, and It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work</a>. They explicitly champion simplicity, honesty, and avoiding manipulative tactics, including making it easy for people to leave! And their product reflects those values. Even Spotify, which is currently very much on my naughty list for <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/spotify-has-an-ai-problem-a4d6729c715b"">unrelated reasons</a>, allows for fairly painless cancellation, I recently learned.</p><p>There are lots of examples of companies that don’t require the use of dark patterns to succeed. They treat user trust as an asset that compounds over time. It isn’t necessarily an ethical argument, for them its a pragmatic business strategy!

<h4>Algorithmic governmentality and the merging of government and corporations</h4><figure><img alt=""Elon Musk waving his chainsaw"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RYEN4IkCXx-euotaNF7BeA.png"" /><figcaption>Gage Skidmore from Surprise, AZ, <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Elon_Musk_(54350004570).jpg"">CC BY-SA 2.0</a></figcaption></figure><p>‘The EU should be abolished,’ is what Elon Musk claimed in a recent post on X. In relation to this, in September, some of Musk’s peers purchased TikTok's U.S. operations. Musk complains — I mean <em>tweets</em> — a lot, and tech acquisitions happen often, but these two examples illustrate how corporate interests and governments are connected. This text will show this corporate-governmental interplay. I will do this by looking at social media timeline design.</p><p>Facebook has been <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20110925211838/http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150286921207131"">experimenting with algorithmically showing posts</a> since 2011. However, the real transformation occurred in early 2016, when <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/15/filteredgram/"">Instagram</a> and <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/10/twitter-rolls-out-tool-to-give-users-option-for-algorithmic-timeline.html"">Twitter</a> adopted a <em>smart</em> timeline. From this moment on, users are bombarded with posts from accounts they never willfully subscribed to. This UX design adjustment, driven by KPIs and user engagement, has an impact in several ways.</p><p>I will use several thinkers to illustrate the social effects of these UX choices. I will begin with political theorist Jodi Dean, who lays out <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214988432-capital-s-grave"">4 features of <em>neo-feudalism</em></a>:</p><ol><li><strong>Parcellated sovereignty </strong>— the fragmentation of powers</li><li><strong>Lords and serfs</strong> — a small group of elites holding power over an economically vulnerable population</li><li><strong>Hinterlandisation</strong> — the thriving of cities at the expense of rural areas</li><li><strong>Catastrophic anxiety</strong></li></ol><p>I will first turn to how <em>anxiety</em> has infiltrated society via social media feeds. For Dean, feelings of insecurity and anxiety are linked to a lack of stability in life. For instance, by not having financial savings or social security. Dean states that:</p><blockquote>‘Neofeudalism’s catastrophic anxiety flourishes in the affective infrastructures of communicative capitalism where there is no commonly shared meaning. Lies circulate as easily as or more easily than truth.’ <br /> — <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214988432-capital-s-grave"">Jodi Dean</a></blockquote><p>This form of <em>anxiety</em> is about financial vulnerability. Still, less obvious aspects, like algorithm-driven <em>information</em>, also contribute to this feeling.</p><p>While someone in the past might have bought newspapers, people today often get their news through social media. Regardless, ‘[conventional] media outlets act in accordance with the <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1080/01972243.2023.2230471"">incentives created by Facebook</a>.’ Media, therefore, make their content more attractive for social media users. The number of <em>likes</em> or <em>shares</em> represent an online currency and functions as ‘<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448211027174"">popularity cues for editors</a>.’</p><p><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1080/1461670x.2023.2263799"">Media outlets thus adapt to social media’s ecosystem</a>. They negotiate newsworthiness with engagement. This includes adding more emojis, question marks, exclamation marks, and emotional words?!!? Editors are also writing clickbait titles. This leads to Dean’s idea of <em>catastrophic anxiety </em>and less precision at the ‘detriment of journalistic quality.’</p><blockquote>“When a free man is voting, it is not enough that the truth is known by someone else, by some scholar or administrator or legislator. The voters must have it, all of them.”<br /> — Alexander Meiklejohn</blockquote><p>One could argue that sensationalism might not per se harm being well-informed, but the simplification of news definitely does.</p><blockquote>‘Less important aspects of a news story are exposed at the expense of the core information, leaving readers less or even insufficiently informed.’<br /> — <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1080/1461670x.2023.2263799"">Source</a></blockquote><p>Anxiety and sensation are prioritised over accuracy.</p><p>Not only does news become less reliable, the content shifts as well. Culture war topics have become more prominent than economic news. This started with the birth of U.S. cable news in the late 1990s and has been accelerated by social media. ‘Switching from an entirely cultural to entirely economic segment reduces viewership,’ therefore…</p><blockquote>‘the focus on the culture war reflects a distinctive business strategy focused on audience size maximization.’</blockquote><blockquote>‘[News has] seen a shift in public politial attention: the tax, social insurance, and labor policies … have largely been eclipsed by cleavages over racial and gender issues, political correctness, immigration, religion, guns, and crime.’<br /> — <a href=""http://dropbox.com/scl/fi/27v4xxenpo8wotkw1238e/rao-jmp.pdf"">Source</a> (all 3 quotes above)</blockquote><p>Hence, social media platforms influence how journalism is conducted. It also impacts the content users consume and the topics relevant in public and political discourse.</p><figure><img alt=""Brexit culture war campaign"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*RpF9kl2Qt3gfDUTs.jpg"" /><figcaption>Brexit culture war campaign — ukip.org</figcaption></figure><p>The 2016 U.S. presidential elections and the Brexit referendum were the first major elections after the introduction of the algorithmic timeline. These events might suggest that ‘the fragmentation of social media and the role of sentiment, could <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1108/EJM-07-2019-0598."">enhance political polarization</a>.’ The smart timeline has thus contributed to the perhaps somewhat surprising result of both elections.</p><p>These elections can help us understand the ongoing trend where culture-war issues are more important than economic policies. People become less engaged with socioeconomic issues. Musk and the TikTok investors are given an opportunity to further neoliberalise society, and they want to take it.</p><p>As comparative literature scholar <a href=""https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/id/eprint/132076/"">Stephen Shapiro</a> paraphrases philosopher Michel Foucault:</p><blockquote>‘Neoliberalism insists on the necessity of relying on the competitive market as the normative model for all institutions, while on the other, it vastly amplifies the State’s institutional violence.’</blockquote><p>The role of the government is not to leave the market alone, but to promote it. Neoliberalism relies on game theory. It assumes everyone is constantly thinking about how to maximise their self-interest. Endless competition.</p><p>Foucault argues that neoliberalism should be understood alongside <em>governmentality.</em> Governmentality doesn’t lean on traditional disciplinary action. Instead, it relies on mechanisms designed to ensure people continuously adapt to changing guidelines. Conditioning the herd.</p><p>For Foucault, new techniques of control are always a response to society's demands and emotions. For instance, today’s sentiment about child groomers is used by <a href=""https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-10-2025-003250_EN.html"">the EU to justify giving <em>intel</em> organisations access to any individual’s private messages</a>.</p><p>These forms of <em>security</em> (or <em>biopolitics</em>) create an optimal social balance. <em>Security</em> uses existing environments to ensure a desirable outcome, whatever that might be. “Decent” people mostly.</p><p>Social media timelines can be among the systems used to condition people. This is a process Foucault calls <em>normation</em>. Normation creates an optimal model with specific outcomes that should nudge individuals to comply.</p><p>Foucault’s <em>security</em> doesn’t result from intentional design but from a series of techniques and institutions that gradually converge.</p><blockquote>‘The mechanism of security involves, in short, a series of processes which are, up to a certain point, aleatory and which it is only at the end and, as it were, a posteriori, that one will be able to say: this was a good security mechanism, it worked.’ <br /> — <a href=""https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/philosophy/intranets/undergraduate/modules/ph348/2013-14/foucault_-_security_territory_population_11_jan_1978__25_jan_1978.pdf"">Michel Foucault</a></blockquote><p>Belgian scholar <a href=""https://researchportal.unamur.be/en/persons/arouvroy/"">Antoinette Rouvroy</a> calls the way social media controls and shapes populations <em>algorithmic governmentality</em>.</p><figure><img alt=""People using their phone in public transport"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*fWAT60miqkOXliP6"" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=""https://unsplash.com/@hughhan?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Hugh Han</a> on <a href=""https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>A further impact of algorithms results from<em> rich-get-richer dynamics</em>. Popular content is promoted by the algorithm, resulting in feeds having less niche and more mainstream content.</p><p>Why this is problematic is explained by French philosopher Jacques Rancière. He claims that a broad <em>police force </em>decides who is allowed to speak, who should be heard, and who matters. For Rancière,<em> the police</em> refers to the act of policing and is about the institutions and systems that maintain social hierarchies.</p><blockquote>‘The police is thus first an order of bodies that defines the allocation of ways of doing, ways of being, and ways of saying, and sees that those bodies are assigned by name to a particular place and task.’ <br /> — <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/809331.Disagreement"">Jacques Rancière</a></blockquote><p>Because algorithms enable the mainstream to push out minorities and their ideas, social media thus decides who belongs to the virtual society and who should be excluded. The excluded and marginalised are those Rancière calls those <em>without a share</em> (<em>les sans-part</em>). By being shadow-banned, these groups are <em>wronged</em> (<em>le tort</em>).</p><p>Personalised timelines also lead to <em>filter bubbles</em>. Because platforms optimise for engagement, <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118x.2021.1883707"">users are shown content that interests them</a> and aligns with their viewpoints. This creates aversion to the unfamiliar. This effect, called <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infoecopol.2023.101020"">the <em>algorithm paradox</em></a><em>, </em>reduces exposure to contradictory opinions. Something that is, of course, essential for a healthy debate. <em>Normation </em>happens when<em> </em>people become unfamiliar with the unfamiliar.</p><p>Whereas algorithms create <em>filter bubbles</em>, <em>echo chambers</em> result from individual users’ selection behaviour. Users tend to select channels they agree with and exclude conflicting information. They also join groups of like-minded peers.</p><blockquote>‘According to group polarisation theory, an echo chamber can act as a mechanism to reinforce existing opinions moving the entire group toward more extreme positions.’<br /> — <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2022.101407"">Source</a></blockquote><p><em>Group polarisation theory</em> works alongside <em>post-liking</em> biases within the entire group. This ‘creates a <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1080/10584609.2020.1713267"">self-perpetuating cycle</a>, where attitudinally congruent articles remain at the top of the feed.’</p><p>Because of limited exposure to differing opinions and only reading posts from like-minded individuals, people rarely change their viewpoints. Users who ‘flip stances have significantly more neighbors engaging in a <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1109/tnse.2022.3185785."">collective expression of the opposite stance</a>.’</p><p>All the mechanisms discussed so far explain how social media supports the ‘neoliberal mode of government which produces the subjects it needs’ and how <em>catastrophic anxiety</em> is stimulated.</p><p>Today’s algorithmic culture is transforming the world into a <em>post-truth political age.</em> It makes the liberal decades almost obsolete.</p><blockquote>[Social media algorithms] were never designed to operate through liberal principles, since the ensuing algorithmic profile is not a collective public, or even a counterpublic, but an entirely different entity altogether.<br /> — <a href=""https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/id/eprint/132076/"">Stephen Shapiro</a> (and quote above)</blockquote><p>Dean claims that the reduction of the power of the people has been intentional. While this process began in the 1970s, today’s state of affairs results in a situation in which ‘private economic power trumps public law.’ This not only reduces the policy options available to states but also actively erodes popular sovereignty.</p><p>Governments <em>privatise</em> their nation-state and hand over control to companies, supported by subsidies and tax breaks. This, in turn, puts governments ‘in a position where they can no longer meet basic social needs and so remain bound to private firms until the firms decide to leave.’ Corporations abuse this reliance and threaten to leave, thus bullying governments further.</p><p>The corporate world is gradually becoming the government. You see where this is going. This trend is clearly visible at today’s White House. Lobbying practices, donations, and industry specialists move towards Washington, and <a href=""https://www.ituc-csi.org/corporate-underminers-of-democracy-2025."">massive corporate contracts circle back</a>. ‘I donate a big bag of money to some nonsense event, and I get a nice tariff reduction or a government contract in return.

Although Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and X are all products of American companies, TikTok is not. Or was not. This thus gives a challenge for the White House. How can they conduct <em>algorithmic governmentality </em>on TikTok if the Chinese own it?</p><p>They’ve used other platforms for a decade.</p><blockquote>‘From the mid-2010s until today, social media entities have been persuaded to implement a range of restrictions on supposed “hate speech,” on supposed “misinformation” about medicine or elections, and even for a time on allegations that COVID-19 leaked from a Chinese government lab. Some of that persuasion (or perhaps pressure) has come from the U.S. federal government.’<br /> — <a href=""https://www.amacad.org/publication/daedalus/future-government-pressure-social-media-platforms"">Source</a></blockquote><p>American platforms have also been trying to influence the Gaza debate. <a href=""https://www.hrw.org/report/2023/12/21/metas-broken-promises/systemic-censorship-palestine-content-instagram-and"">Human Rights Watch</a> claims Meta has ‘been silencing voices in support of Palestine and Palestinian human rights on Instagram and Facebook in a wave of heightened censorship of social media.’ In addition, YouTube has been accused of ‘<a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/youtube-israel-gaza-moderation"">inconsistent enforcement</a>’ of content removal regarding the conflict.</p><p>With TikTok outside the American sphere of influence, yet with a big impact, this poses <em>governmentality </em>challenges. It may thus not be a shocker that a group of investors, including Oracle co-founder and <a href=""https://www.timesofisrael.com/record-53-8-million-raised-for-idf-soldiers-at-beverly-hills-gala/"">IDF philanthropist</a> Larry Ellison and <a href=""https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-andreessen-horowitz-boosting-israel-vc-investments-1001503552"">Israeli tech ecosystem investor</a> Marc Andreessen, is buying TikTok.</p><p><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/09/25/tiktok-deal-sale-algorithm-changes/"">A senior White House official expressed</a> that</p><blockquote><em>‘</em>ByteDance’s reworked algorithm for a U.S. TikTok would use data from only American users and would be overseen by Oracle.

<h4>How shadow repos and data layer helped me move from design handoffs to working prototypes that ship in hours</h4><figure><img alt=""Illustration of two overlapping circles representing “Design” and “Engineering,” with the overlap shaded to show the shared space between the disciplines."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iKZi1S4e49osr-hGUIZDDw.png"" /></figure><p>Over the past few months, I have noticed a quiet shift in how we build products. You start noticing design and engineering overlapping at scale much earlier, pretty much as soon as a feature moves from research into the ideation stage.</p><figure><img alt=""Screen recording of an AI-powered analytics prototype.

I designed the experience, developed the UI with ShadCN components, built the interaction patterns, and connected it to real logic in the background. The prototype pulled data through Supabase MCP calls and interacted with OpenAI APIs to generate adaptive UI components, so the whole thing behaved close to the final product experience rather than a typical mock or demo.</p><p>This shift in how I solve problems pushed me beyond prototyping. I started productionizing my work inside the codebase, learning engineering patterns every day, and developing a clearer sense of how the product should function from end to end across the entire system.</p><blockquote>It moved me from being a designer to becoming a maker, and it is now shaping me into a <strong>context-aware builder</strong>.</blockquote><p>This article is a reflection of that journey, how it improved the velocity, the challenges I encountered, and what we should anticipate, that could define the next chapter of product design development.</p><h3>The Problem I Kept Running Into</h3><p>When the <a href=""https://spin.atomicobject.com/designers-vibe-coding/"">vibe coding culture</a> started appearing everywhere, I saw significant people from the design community building retro games, dashboards, weather widgets, note apps, and many experiments powered by AI-generated code. It was encouraging to see designers making ideas work, but it reminded me of the famous <a href=""https://dribbble.com/"">Dribbble</a> phase where everything looked beautiful but very little made it into real products.</p><p>I kept asking myself:</p><blockquote>Is this just another playground? Or can this way of working eventually influence production software?</blockquote><p>The understanding of what sits under the hood among the community was still early, and most prototypes focused more on exploration than real functionality. It felt like the community is just beginning to scratch the surface of what is possible.</p><p>The bigger issue was not the experiments themselves. It was that designers still did not have a functional layer to work in. This gap between design and development has been <a href=""https://webdesignerdepot.com/the-designer-developer-handoff-is-still-broken-why/"">well-documented</a>, with many teams struggling to move from static mockups to functional products. Figma, the most common tool designers use, sits in an isolated space. Even with custom plugins, Code Connect, and dev mode, the influence on the codebase is minimal. Most of it feels like a workaround. The design mocks rarely have the ability to test with real or dynamic data.</p><p>The other challenge is<strong> feature fragmentation</strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""Figma project view showing a grid of separate design files, illustrating how individual features are organized into their own design files."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dzXHJTKOo0BIsQkJrOcUpg.png"" /></figure><p>In Figma, each feature is usually worked on in a separate file. It gives clarity for design, but it does not reflect how a real product works. In an actual product, features live together, share context, depend on each other, and behave as a single system. Moving across flows should feel natural and connected, not scattered across isolated files.</p><p>If you look at the distribution, the user interacts with the final product. Testers have staging and UAT environments. Developers have a full git workflow with branches and review layers. <strong>Designers do not have anything equivalent. </strong>There is no layer that lets us build with a real functional context.</p><h3>Where I Started: Two Paths</h3><p>My initial integration of AI into my workflow was actually quite practical. I was trying to optimize some design operations and design system workflows, and I did not have enough bandwidth to fit all of it into my routine. There was no AI integration inside IDEs at that time. Everything was manual, disconnected, and very experimental. So used AI generated scripts for these automations.</p><figure><img alt=""Side-by-side graphic showing an early AI-assisted workflow. On the left is a JavaScript script used to classify and extract color formats from CSS. On the right is a spreadsheet containing hundreds of color definitions generated from that script."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Dbrv3k8YWwdNbM9Y"" /></figure><p>Seeing the potential, I wanted to understand the full range of AI API offerings beyond prompt-based code generation. During the same timeline, I was exploring prototyping with Origami and wanted to see if I could bring AI capability directly into the prototype. I experimented with building an Origami prototype that used the OpenAI API for chat completion requests and audio-to-text conversion</p><figure><img alt=""Animated gif of music controller touch interface where interaction emerges without visible buttons and purely based on contextual feedback and motion."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/956/1*0yMZrq2MCBYpNd-BHvKbYg.gif"" /><figcaption>Whisper API from Open AI for converting song audio into lyrics</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=""Animated prototype gif of live camera feed, where the user drag to select any region.

Understanding this separation became an important part of how I now approach prototyping ideas.</p><h3>Finding the Right Tools</h3><p>As I started building more rigorously, I needed to settle on tools that matched my workflow. I explored several options including <a href=""https://v0.app/"">v0</a> for quick layouts and <a href=""https://cursor.com/"">Cursor</a> for its smooth IDE experience, but token exhaustion rate became a practical constraint.</p><p><a href=""https://claude.com/product/claude-code"">Claude Code</a> stood out for its efficiency. Using the same Sonnet model across different tools, Claude Code handled tokens far better and stayed lightweight for repeated everyday use. It began as a simple terminal interface but quickly became my primary tool because it fit the way I build products every day.</p><p>The rise of MCPs (Model Context Protocol) also meant that most missing features could be achieved across different AI-powered IDEs anyway. What mattered more was finding a tool that matched my cost and workflow needs for sustained use.</p><h3>Where I Arrived: The Shadow Repo Approach</h3><p>I came across a <a href=""https://x.com/nayakkayak/status/1958677324863328643?s=20"">tweet</a> by Aatish Nayak, VP product at Harvey, about building an entire frontend using vibe coding. He called it a <strong>shadow repo</strong>, and the idea made immediate sense. The concept addresses what <a href=""https://smart-interface-design-patterns.com/articles/design-handoff/"">Dan Mall and Brad Frost call the ‘Hot Potato Process’</a>, rapid iteration between designers and developers that eliminates traditional handoff friction.</p><p>Think of it like this: if staging/UAT is where testers validate features, a shadow repo is where designers validate functionality. This approach creates breathing room to experiment with full product context and less risk.</p><p>A real git branch carries engineering expectations, reviews, and risk. A shadow repo removes that pressure. You can try ideas, break things, and test with real or mock data without touching the product codebase.</p><p>Here is how I shaped workflow with this shadow repo:</p><ul><li>Build a repo that mirrors the real app structure</li><li>Follow production component patterns</li><li>Use Figma for skeleton and visual direction</li><li>Translate with Figma MCP, applying coded design system rules</li><li>Refine through manual edits and prompting</li><li>Use Notion MCP for handoff review notes</li><li>Port to production with developer review and proper API wiring</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Flow diagram showing how design and code inputs feed into a shadow repository.

This breaks down when replicating a full product experience.</p><p>I created a shadow backend using Supabase. Supabase’s free tier plus <a href=""https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/mcp"">Supabase MCP tools </a>were perfect for this: quick tables, simple edge functions, instant data edits, predictable structure. This made the shadow repo feel complete.</p><blockquote>This enabled: Functional UI + Coded Interactions + Real Data</blockquote><figure><img alt=""Flow diagram showing how three inputs feed into a shadow repo workflow. A “Design File” flows into the system through Figma MCP, a “Data Layer” flows in through Supabase MCP, and a “Component Library” flows in through ShadCN MCP. All three converge into the “Shadow Repo Codebase,” which then connects to Notion MCP to generate the final “Handoff Spec.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7QVOgioibRVv58O_6ZbcTQ.png"" /></figure><p>Why not use the actual API of the product?</p><ul><li>Unmoderated calls are expensive</li><li>Prototypes trigger unpredictable requests</li><li>And I did not want to risk touching production backend systems at this point.</li></ul><h3>Enabling AI Features Within Prototypes</h3><p>Once the data layer was in place, I could explore the second path: enabling prototypes with AI features themselves.</p><p>At Dynamo AI, our tools rely heavily on AI systems. My prototypes needed to behave like AI-powered products. I integrated lightweight OpenAI API calls to replicate real-world feature responses.</p><p>Supabase made this efficient. I could store conversation history, manage state, and handle AI responses without complex backend logic. MCP tools connected everything seamlessly for defining actual API calls, response processing, and dynamic interface updates.</p><p>And for inspecting within the browser by the agent during active development, the <a href=""https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-devtools-mcp"">Chrome Dev Tools MCP</a> solves it with my Claude setup.</p><h3>What I Gained from Building Functionally</h3><p>This approach doesn’t require designers to become full engineers, a <a href=""https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/designers-coding"">decades-old debate</a> that often misses the point. As <a href=""https://capwatkins.com/blog/why-designers-really-should-learn-to-code"">Cap Watkins argues</a>, learning to code isn’t about independence but about deepening collaboration and shared understanding.</p><p>With this setup, I was able to prototype working features and ship much faster. In one instance, the developers reviewed the prototype code and had the production version ready for testing in a single evening. That was the moment I realized this workflow is quite practical, scalable and increase the velocity to a greater extent. I was no longer handing off design files. I was handing off a working prototype with a higher probability of accurately representing the idea into production quickly.</p><figure><img alt=""Animated neon illustration of two outlined human heads facing each other, with glowing brains connected by looping, pulsating energy bands."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/0*69dzyRxN3kU5bKMx.gif"" /></figure><p>These are some of the shifts I noticed in my approach:</p><p><strong>Better fine-tuning of UI component architecture: </strong>Seeing components run with real variants, props, and constraints helped me refine the architecture upfront and create cleaner, more scalable patterns.</p><p><strong>Handling Edge Cases Early:</strong> AI made it easier to surface edge cases and logical gaps early, long before engineering touched them.</p><p><strong>Thinking Through the Data Layer:</strong> Working with real-like data broadened my thinking on structuring payloads and designing interface for efficient API usage and holistic thinking of how data flows through the entire system functionally.</p><p><strong>Enabling AI Features to Augment Capabilities:</strong> Integrating actual AI behavior into prototypes changed how I think about product features. Instead of designing around static functionality, I started considering how AI could augment existing capabilities.</p><h3>How This Changed My Role in Problem Solving</h3><p>This entire experiment changed my perspective on what it means to be a designer.</p><p>When you understand how data flows, how components are structured, what triggers API calls, and what engineers worry about, your design decisions become grounded in reality.</p><blockquote>You stop thinking like someone who “hands off” and start thinking like someone who builds.</blockquote><figure><img alt=""Animated gif of minimalist illustration of an open hand holding a simple outlined 3D house shape resting on a flat platform"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Wt8AEi9FyLKbiqZY.gif"" /></figure><h3>The Challenges That Come With It</h3><p>AI coding tools are powerful, but they also come with real headaches:</p><p><strong>The rabbit-hole edits:</strong> AI produces the first version well, but small edits sometimes break the entire flow and get you into an unnecessary loop of issues.</p><p><strong>Pattern-level mistakes:</strong> With React components, I have faced unnecessary hooks, redundant functions, nested components, strange abstractions, and recursive API calls.</p><p><strong>AI fingerprints:</strong> AI often generates the same UI patterns for the same problem and ignores existing components.</p><p><strong>Overbuilding:</strong> It is easy to drift into solving engineering problems and lose sight of the actual user problem.</p><p>However, these challenges eventually can be addressed by defining rules that you can mention in your AI tool. In Claude, this is supported by <a href=""https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices"">Claude.md</a> and <a href=""https://www.claude.com/blog/skills"">Claude Skills</a>, which are project-agnostic and allow you to define explicit conditions and rules that guide how the AI should approach your programming tasks.</p><h3>What This Means Going Forward</h3><p>The way we build products is shifting steadily. AI coding tools are changing the relationship between design and engineering. Shadow repos and vibe-coded prototypes let designers get much closer to reality. Complexity becomes easier to reason about. Ideas get validated faster.</p><blockquote>Teams spend less time interpreting and more time building.</blockquote><p>We are moving from designer to maker to builder through changes in capability.</p><p>This mirrors what <a href=""https://www.uxtigers.com/post/vibe-coding-vibe-design"">Jakob Nielsen describes as ‘vibe design’</a>, where AI enables rapid prototyping and designers work more iteratively with functional interfaces rather than static deliverables.</p><p>The shadow repo approach might not be a permanent solution. It is a good transitional framework that works while the industry figures out what the next generation of product-building tools should be. Right now, this framework works well for our team to build functionally without the constraints of traditional tools or the risks of production systems.</p><p>The industry is figuring this out together.

<h4>Moving from accidental learning to deliberate capability development.</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vp3jzP0mKvpYW8zZh5x68Q.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>The retrospective felt like a breakthrough. The team diagnosed exactly where their reasoning broke down, mapped the root causes, and committed to doing better. Three months later, they repeated the same mistakes.</p><p>The diagnosis was accurate. What was missing was a system to turn awareness into development. Diagnosis alone doesn’t create change.</p><p>Most improvement efforts fail not from lack of insight, but from lack of judgment infrastructure. Teams recognize that they skip assumption testing or misinterpret customer feedback. But recognition without practice is just self-awareness that fades.</p><p>In my previous article, “<a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/the-anatomy-of-product-discovery-judgment-0cb28b28cc7c"">The anatomy of discovery judgment</a>,” I mapped the 19 critical judgment points where human reasoning determines whether teams build the right things.</p><p>This article introduces the remaining components of the Discovery Judgment Framework: how to <em>measure</em> judgment quality, the <em>practices</em> that systematically strengthen it, and the <em>maturity model</em> that tracks your progress over time.</p><h3><strong>Measuring Your Progress: Four Quality Dimensions</strong></h3><p>You can’t develop what you can’t see. Teams track velocity, output, and outcomes — but the quality of judgment remains hidden. Yet judgment determines whether that velocity produces value or waste.</p><p>Where the 19 judgment points show where to focus, these four dimensions show how well you’re reasoning at each point. Think of each as a 1–5 scale: low-judgment teams typically score 1.5–2, while high-judgment teams score 4–4.5.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hTCjYVDTQjpgdZK6souu7Q.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>Use the diagram to rate your team honestly on each dimension. Without clear feedback loops and deliberate reflection, teams miss critical learning opportunities — a pattern White (2021) identified in his research on reflection in design practice.</p><h4><strong>Example of judgment quality in action</strong></h4><p><strong>Low judgment</strong>: “We decided to build feature X” (no documented reasoning)</p><p><strong>High judgment</strong>: “We prioritized feature X over Y because: (1) it tests our riskiest assumption about user adoption, (2) engineering complexity is 2 weeks vs 6 months, (3) three customers said they’d pilot it immediately, giving us rapid validation.”</p><p>Most teams operate with low judgment quality without realizing it. Making these four dimensions visible is the first step to improvement.</p><h3>Your Journey: The Maturity Model</h3><p>Think of judgment development as a maturity curve, not a binary state. The Discovery Judgment Framework’s fourth component shows how capability evolves.</p><figure><img alt=""A diagram illustrating a five-level maturity model, progressing from “Level 1: Unconscious” at the bottom-left to “Level 5: Self-Improving” at the top-right. Each level includes a description and a typical timeframe."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*k1YN4KOJ3IGCri46DoBQ7g.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>Most teams begin at Levels 1–2 and progress to Levels 3–4 within 6–18 months through consistent practice. Reaching Level 5 may take years, but it becomes self-reinforcing.</p><p>Maturity models provide teams with clear progression paths. Ballarín’s (2022) work on UX maturity for Scrum teams shows how these frameworks help identify where to focus capability development next.</p><h3>Where are you now?</h3><p>Honestly assess your team’s current level:</p><ul><li><strong>Level 1 — Unaware</strong>: We don’t have a systematic approach to discovery. We can’t explain why we made past decisions. Learning happens by accident.</li><li><strong>Level 2 — Aware</strong>: We recognize judgment matters. We sometimes employ practices such as assumption mapping or evidence tracking, but not consistently. We’re starting to document reasoning.</li><li><strong>Level 3 — Practicing</strong>: We consistently use 2–3 core practices. We can trace most decisions back to evidence. Reflection is becoming routine. We’re deliberate about judgment development.</li><li><strong>Level 4 — Systematic</strong>: All five practices are integrated into our workflow. We measure judgment quality routinely. Learning compounds across cycles. Judgment development is no longer special — it’s how we work.</li><li><strong>Level 5 — Self-Improving</strong>: Judgment development feels natural. New team members absorb these capabilities through osmosis. We continuously refine our approach. The system reinforces itself.</li></ul><p>In my experience working with product teams, most start at Level 1 or 2. The practices below move you to Level 3–4 over 6–18 months.</p><h3>The Five Practices That Strengthen Judgment</h3><p>Moving up the maturity curve requires systematic practices — the framework’s third component. These work with whatever process frameworks you use (Agile, Design Thinking, OKRs). The question isn’t what tools you use, but whether they enable judgment development.</p><p>Start with one core practice (Evidence Tracking, Assumption Mapping, or Experiment Design). Add integration practices (Decision Documentation and Reflection Practice) as you mature.</p><h4>Three core practices</h4><p>These three practices generate and test insights:</p><p><strong>1. Evidence Tracking</strong> maintains the lineage from raw data to decisions — customer quotes connect to insights, opportunities, and ultimately decisions.</p><p><strong><em>Example</em></strong><em>:</em> After conducting 12 interviews, you identify “context loss during handoffs” as a recurring issue. Your evidence trail: 8 of 12 mentioned it, 6 used similar language (“black hole”), 40% of support escalations involve missing information. You can trace decisions to specific evidence — and if solutions fail, review whether you misinterpreted evidence or solved the wrong problem.</p><p><strong>2. Assumption Mapping</strong> makes implicit beliefs explicit and testable — before building anything, articulate what must be true for success across five categories: Desirability, Feasibility, Viability, Usability, Ethics.</p><p>As Christopher (2024) explains in his Bootcamp article on UX mapping techniques, assumption mapping — typically used at project kickoff — helps teams identify which assumptions are significant unknowns requiring validation versus unimportant factors that can be deferred.</p><p><strong><em>Example</em></strong>: Your assumption map reveals: “Executives will log in daily” (riskiest), “We can build real-time sync in 2 sprints,” “This drives $500K in upsell.” After 2 weeks of testing, adoption stays below 40%. You pivot — executives prefer email summaries. That 2-week test saved $ 180,000.</p><p><strong>3. Experiment Design</strong> structures learning so each test produces actionable insight — each experiment has a clear hypothesis, success criteria, and decision threshold.</p><p><strong><em>Example</em></strong><em>:</em> Instead of an 18-month overhaul, you test a 2-week experiment with a simple template. After two weeks, adoption is 55% — managers use it, but team members often forget the details. You’ve learned the fundamental constraint in two weeks for minimal investment, not 18 months and $2 million later.</p><h4>Two integration practices</h4><p>These practices capture and compound learning:</p><p><strong>4. Decision Documentation</strong> records not just what was decided, but the reasoning behind it. Capture supporting evidence, assumptions carried forward, alternatives rejected, and confidence level. This creates institutional memory and enables the extraction of learning.</p><p><strong>5. Reflection Practice</strong> closes the learning loop. The key is examining what you learned about both the customer <em>and your own reasoning</em> — the double-loop learning introduced in my article “<a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/it-seems-anyone-can-build-software-now-how-do-you-build-the-right-software-182057dfa122"">When building software became easier with AI, deciding became harder.</a>”</p><p>Single-loop learning solves problems within existing systems; double-loop learning challenges the underlying beliefs and assumptions themselves. Overeem (2021) frames this as the difference between doing things right and questioning whether you’re doing the right things. Discovery judgment requires this deeper reflection — not just asking “Did this work?” but “Were our assumptions valid? Should we be asking different questions entirely?”</p><p>Schedule regular reflection — after launches, retrospectives, or quarterly — to examine: What surprised us? What would we do differently? What did this reveal about how we think?</p><h3>How the Framework Components Work Together</h3><p>The four components work as an integrated system: diagnose weak points, measure quality, apply practices, and track maturity. Each cycle strengthens both customer understanding and reasoning capability.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: Identify Evidence Interpretation as weak (Component 1) → assess quality (Component 2) → implement Evidence Tracking (Component 3) → progress from Level 2 to Level 3 over 6–12 months (Component 4).</p><p>The five practices form a continuous cycle: Evidence Tracking → Assumption Mapping → Experiment Design → Decision Documentation → Reflection Practice.</p><figure><img alt=""A circular diagram showing the five practices connected in a continuous cycle. Arrows flow from Evidence Tracking to Assumption Mapping, to Experiment Design, to Decision Documentation, and then to Reflection Practice, before returning to Evidence Tracking. At the center, text reads “Each cycle strengthens judgment about customers and reasoning.” The circular flow illustrates how practices integrate and compound learning over time."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*7n4sEFRTjcrc_DV1y3X9Pg.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><h3>Putting It Into Practice</h3><p>Judgment develops through two complementary approaches — and the integration of both creates sustainable capacity:</p><p><strong>Learning by doing</strong>: Apply practices to real discovery work. Learn from cycles. Find internal mentors who share their reasoning — not just decisions, but how they think about problems, what signals they watch for, what tradeoffs they consider.</p><p><strong>Structured learning</strong>: Targeted training on specific judgment points and practices. Deliberate skill-building. Systematic coverage of areas you might miss through experience alone.</p><p>The most effective approach combines both. Structured learning provides principles; experiential learning embeds them. Training teaches assumption mapping; projects teach which assumptions matter in your context. Neither alone creates lasting change — integration creates professionals who reason systematically and apply judgment contextually.</p><h4>Your implementation roadmap</h4><p>Regardless of where you are, start with the same first step.</p><p><strong>1. Today: Choose ONE practice that addresses your weak point:</strong></p><ul><li>Weak at Evidence Interpretation? → Start Evidence Tracking</li><li>Weak at Assumptions? → Start Assumption Mapping</li><li>Weak at Validation? → Start Experiment Design</li></ul><p><strong>2. This sprint: Implement that practice:</strong></p><ul><li>Set up the system (tools, templates, workflows)</li><li>Apply it to one active decision</li><li>Document what you learn</li></ul><p><strong>3. 30 days from now: Assess improvement using the four dimensions:</strong></p><ul><li>Can you trace the reasoning better? (Reasoning Transparency)</li><li>Are decisions more evidence-based? (Evidence Rigour)</li><li>Did you catch biases earlier? (Bias Awareness)</li><li>What changed in how you think? (Learning Depth)</li></ul><p><strong>4. After validation: Expand to a second practice or deepen the first.</strong></p><p>Whether working alone or as part of a team, the fundamentals remain the same — but each practice requires specific habits:</p><ul><li><strong>For Evidence Tracking:</strong> Keep a simple log linking each decision to specific customer quotes or data points. When a decision proves wrong, trace back to see where the interpretation failed.</li><li><strong>For Assumption Mapping:</strong> Before each sprint, list three assumptions that could invalidate your current direction. Rank them by risk and design one test.</li><li><strong>For Reflection:</strong> After each cycle, write one paragraph on what outcomes revealed about your reasoning process — not just about customers, but about how you interpreted signals and made tradeoffs.</li></ul><p>AI can surface patterns you might miss during reflection — contradictions in your reasoning, gaps in your evidence, assumptions you haven’t tested. But determining which patterns matter, and what they mean for your next decision, remains yours alone.</p><p>The goal isn’t perfect discovery — it’s learning to decide better with each cycle.</p><h3>Your Next Move</h3><p>You’re facing a real decision here.</p><p>One approach is to keep your focus on execution. When everything feels uncertain, doubling down on what you know how to do makes sense. It’s not wrong — it’s how most people will respond.</p><p>Another approach: Use this uncertainty to develop judgment incrementally. Begin with one practice at a single judgment point. Build the capacity while pressure is still manageable, before it becomes urgent.</p><p>Here’s what’s worth considering: As AI makes execution more efficient, organizations will need fewer people executing tasks and more people making informed decisions. The question isn’t whether to develop judgment — it’s whether to start now, while you can do it gradually, or later when the pressure is higher.</p><p>You don’t need to be brave. You don’t need to transform your organization. You don’t even need to tell anyone you’re doing this. Just pick one practice and apply it to one decision this week.</p><p>That’s how judgment develops — through small, deliberate actions repeated over cycles. Start now, and in a year you’ll have skills most of your peers will take years to develop — if they develop them at all. Speed and judgment used to be a tradeoff. Now they’re both required — and only one can be automated.</p><p><strong><em>The future belongs to those who decide well, not just deliver fast. That future can start now.</em></strong></p><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Four quality dimensions make judgment visible and measurable: Evidence Rigour, Reasoning Transparency, Bias Awareness/Ethical Alignment, and Learning Depth.</li><li>Teams progress through 5 maturity levels — most start at Level 1–2 and can reach Level 3–4 in 6–18 months through consistent practice.</li><li>Five practices strengthen judgment: three core practices (Evidence Tracking, Assumption Mapping, Experiment Design) plus two integration practices (Decision Documentation, Reflection Practice). Start with one core practice.</li><li>Two learning pathways work together: experiential learning through real-world projects and structured learning through targeted training. The integration of both creates lasting change.</li><li>Start narrow: one practice, one judgment point, prove value, then expand.</li></ul><h3>References</h3><p>Ballarín, A. (2022).

<h4><strong>Why UX and Market Research should stop fighting and start working together.</strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Stacks of money"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*p9g1anRJZ3oBky8i5CRiSQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=""https://unsplash.com/@mufidpwt?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"">Mufid Majnun</a> on <a href=""https://unsplash.com/photos/stack-of-books-on-table-LVcjYwuHQlg?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>It’s a debate I’ve been dragged into so many times, I've lost track: UX vs. Market Research? Qual vs. Quant? Who owns the insights? Who make the decisions? Who drives the strategy? Who makes the “real” impact?</p><p>I've been a UX Researcher for over 20 years and my thinking is deeply rooted in building meaningful products and services that solve real human problems… (As opposed to fake problems… you know, the kinds of problems that we invent in order to justify the product we're building-alas, I digress).</p><p>Over the last 5 years, my perspective has shifted greatly.</p><p>After founding Amplinate, working across Big Tech and other industries, consulting with CEOs and Entrepreneurs, and most importantly, collaborating directly with one of the top business coaches in the world, <a href=""https://www.abraham.com/"">Jay Abraham</a>, I’ve come to a humbling conclusion about Research:</p><blockquote>It’s not about methods. It’s not about disciplines or roles. It’s about making the Business money.</blockquote><p>That’s the only way research becomes indispensable. And if we fail to do that? We become expendable. And that’s <em>exactly</em> what’s happening now.</p><h3>The disciplinary distraction: UX vs. Market Research</h3><p>This article builds on my response to a recent discussion in the <a href=""https://mrxpros.com/"">Market Research Pros Google Group</a>.</p><p>The original post brought up the difference between Market Research and UX Research, and did a really good job at delineating the difference between the two in terms of focus and scope and method. I agreed with the post.</p><p>But after spending more time with Market Researchers in the past 5 years, and working with Marketing Legend, Jay Abraham, I started to see more commonalities than differences in our disciplines.</p><figure><img alt=""Josh LaMar and Jay Abraham"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uVdrJDSPf5oBqyrjqbqwIQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Josh LaMar and Jay Abraham</figcaption></figure><p>We are both trying to understand customers and position products/services to meet their needs, either through positioning (Market Research) or through Designing and building the product (UX Research). The goal is the same.</p><p>And yet, the inevitable turf war started coming up… &quot;I do this, you do that.&quot; or, &quot;This is my lane! You stay in your lane!&quot;</p><p>Meanwhile, the business keeps moving ahead and amidst rounds of layoffs, there's a truth that we're not acknowledging:</p><blockquote>Research is irrelevant if it doesn't serve the Business.</blockquote><h3>The methods distraction: Quant vs Qual</h3><p>As the conversation progressed, we got back to the tried and true Quant vs. Qual debate, this time, with the nuance that &quot;Market Research works mainly in Quant&quot; and &quot;UX Research works mainly in Qual.&quot; Maybe it does.</p><p><strong>And maybe, it doesn't actually matter at all.</strong> I've seen Quant-focused UX studies (like Jobs to be Done) and Qual-focused ethnographic Market Research studies (Ever notice that Marketing always have more budget than the product teams?).</p><p>Mixed methods researchers claim they can do both. And it’s true. We toggle between qual and quant to answer different questions as the need arises... But it's still missing the point.</p><p>Why does ownership of methods matter to practitioners? It doesn’t matter to your CEO, that’s for certain. The deeper question is: What decisions are we trying to inform? And who ultimately benefits?</p><blockquote>What actually matters? Making data-informed decisions<strong> </strong>that fuel business outcomes.</blockquote><p>The reality is that researchers are not just out there gathering data that we present as insights and recommendations. We influence decisions about the product. And in today’s economic landscape, every decision that matters is, ultimately, a <em>business</em> decision.</p><h3>Product decisions are business decisions</h3><p>This point deserves its own section… The question came up next as to how to define &quot;Research.&quot; Ok, here's my attempt:</p><blockquote><em>Research (Both UX and Market Research) is</em> <em>the process</em> <em>of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting Customer and Product data to make Business decisions.</em></blockquote><p>This triad (Customer, Product, Business), comes together in <em>Product Truth</em>. It’s the intersection between what customers need your product to do, what you promise it does, and what it actually delivers.</p><figure><img alt=""Venn diagram of product truth showing the intersections of Business, Product, and Customer"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*f4OjHPoamhImzyLjmUc1sw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>When there is alignment between these three: Great! You're on the path to success. But when there's a breakdown… Watch out!</p><p>When you build products using only one or two of the lenses, you risk making flawed decisions:</p><ul><li>Business + Product (without Customer): Leads to commercially viable but irrelevant products.</li><li>Business + Customer (without Product): Creates desirable but unfeasible solutions.</li><li>Product + Customer (without Business): Results in great UX with no path to profitability.</li></ul><p>Misalignment can lead to product failure. But Research plays a unique role: it illuminates the missing perspectives, allowing insights to become a bridge into business strategy.</p><h3>Tough love</h3><p>If I could go back in time, I wouldn’t tell my younger self to learn another methodology or get better at stakeholder management.</p><blockquote>If I could go back in time, I’d give myself one piece of advice: “Care more about the business.”</blockquote><p>I used to think my job was to advocate for the user. And while that’s still true, but it’s a smaller part of the equation than I thought. Advocating for users without understanding the business context is like drawing a map without knowing where your destination is.</p><h3>Want to become essential?</h3><p>I think we all want to be seen as essential to the business… to grow in our careers, to thrive, and to make more money ourselves. And the first step is really simple:</p><ul><li>You want job security? <strong>Help the business make money.</strong></li><li>You want more influence on product decisions? <strong>Help the business make money.</strong></li><li>You want to create more ethical, human-centered products? <strong>Help the business make money</strong>, ideally, in a way that <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/human-flourishing-in-the-age-of-ai-b456b1de31c7"">supports human flourishing</a>.</li></ul><p>That’s how you become essential.</p><p>That’s how you stay in the loop.</p><p>And that’s how you go from being perceived as a cost center to being a profit center… In essence, a <em>strategic partner</em>.</p><h3>Stop arguing and focus on the business</h3><p>This is the moment for UX and Market Research to unite under a shared mission: Helping businesses make human-centered decisions that drive growth.</p><p>We are not against each other. We are collaborators in solving the same problem from different angles, sometimes using the same methods, and always bringing our unique education and background experience to the table to inform how we interpret and make sense of Customer and Product data.</p><p>It's time to stop arguing about who owns the data or which method or discipline is superior.</p><p>Instead, let’s focus on building a future where data is at the core of every strategic business decision.</p><p>Because that’s the only way we all win: Together.</p><p><strong>Josh LaMar</strong> is the Co-Founder and CEO of <a href=""https://amplinate.com/"">Amplinate</a>, an international agency focusing on cross-cultural Research &amp; Design.

Jewelry is so much more than adornment. For some, nameplate bamboo earrings are a way to express identity and cultural pride. For others, an intricate gold-and-ruby ring serves as a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/08/10636309/jewerly-family-heirlooms-stories-second-generation"">family heirloom</a>, passed down to the eldest daughter across generations. For some, a beaded gemstone bracelet is a gift of protection, a talisman that preserves history, spirituality, and love.

I’ve always been a lover girl, so creating something that helps people express care, connection, and emotion feels so fulfilling.” For instance, wearing Esperanza, a stainless-steel heart locket filled with preserved flower petals, is a beautiful way to hold and celebrate your loves.<br /><br /><strong>Greene is Gold</strong> Greene is Gold's Esperanza Heart Locket Necklace, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.greeneisgold.com%2Fproduct-page%2Fesperanza-2"">Greene is Gold</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1102"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937053.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1668&amp;height=1102&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=834:551"" width=""1668"" /><figcaption><strong>Luni</strong><br /><br />Lorenia Henriquez’s jewelry brand <a href=""https://luni.style/"">Luni</a> is a modern expression of magic and heritage.

<p>Few things get under my skin like psyching myself up to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/washing-hair-after-exercise-workout"">wash my hair</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/air-drying-vs-blow-drying-hair-damage"">blow-drying</a> it with painstaking precision, only for it to look — and feel — just as oily as before. You know the frustration, and it seems countless others do, too. </p>



<p>On TikTok, the queries “<a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/discover/why-is-my-hair-greasy-all-of-a-sudden-after-i-wash"">Why is my hair greasy all of a sudden after a wash?</a>” and “<a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/discover/why-is-my-hair-greasy-underneath-after-washing"">Why is my hair greasy underneath after washing?</a>” serve up hundreds of videos with thousands of views, likes, and comments. It’s quite a common conundrum. Suppose you’re doing everything right, like double cleansing your scalp, being sparing with hair oil, and not touching your hair as much throughout the day. Why, then, does your hair never feel clean? </p>



<p>I put the question to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/anabel_kingsley/?hl=en"">Anabel Kingsley</a>, a consultant trichologist, and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/hairtohelp/?hl=en"">Alicia Dobson</a>, a celebrity hairstylist and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X1542341&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbellissimahairtools.com%2F%3Fshpxid%3Df989d3b2-3fe0-4b2c-b82f-6efc8d167416"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bellissima</a> ambassador.

<h2>Why does my hair look oily right after I’ve washed it?</h2>



<p>Interestingly, Kingsley points out that your hair texture can impact how oily your scalp is. “Those with finer hair tend to have more hairs per centimeter on their head [compared to] those with thicker, coarser, or coiled hair textures, and therefore, they have more oil glands producing more sebum,” she explains. This, adds Kingsley, is why fine hair often becomes oily faster.</p>



<p>With genetics out of the way, there are a handful of other reasons why your hair might look and feel oily even after you’ve washed it: “Firstly, not washing your hair thoroughly to properly cleanse away oils, product build-up, and pollution can leave your scalp feeling dirtier,” says Kingsley. </p>



<p>She believes that there’s only one correct way to wash your hair: “Wet the hair fully, [apply] shampoo, and clean the scalp thoroughly for one minute. Then [repeat the step], rinse with water, and apply a conditioner to the ends before rinsing again.” As a rule of thumb, Kingsley says that massaging shampoo into your scalp should take a full 60 seconds — no less. </p>

<h2>Can you train your hair to become less oily?</h2>



<p>Contrary to popular belief, you can’t <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hair-training-tiktok-trend"">“train” your hair</a> to become less oily by reducing the amount you wash it. “There are no pros to <em>not</em> washing your hair regularly,” says Kingsley. “You wouldn’t leave more than three days between washing your face, and you likely wouldn’t wear the same outfit more than a few times before washing it. Apply the same thinking to your hair and scalp,” she says. </p>



<p>Infrequent shampooing can also contribute to scalp problems, says Kingsley. “It leaves excess oils sitting on your scalp, and certain yeasts called malassezia thrive in an oily environment. When these yeasts overgrow, your scalp can become flaky and irritated.”</p>



<h2>When should you use a clarifying shampoo?</h2>



<p>The type of shampoo you use matters, though. Kingsley says it’s imperative to choose a product suited to your hair texture so that it provides the right level of cleansing and moisturizing ingredients — and doesn’t weigh your hair down. Those with fine hair might like to opt for a ‘volumizing’ or ‘thickening’ shampoo, which will clean your hair and scalp without leaving behind a heavy feeling, suggests Kingsley.

<p>If your hair is thick, curly, or coily, consider something packed with hydrating and moisturizing agents like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fca%2Fen%2Fproduct%2FP455861"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">OUAI Thick Hair Shampoo</a>, with panthenol and shea butter, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fca%2Fen%2Fproduct%2FP475150"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">PATTERN by Tracee Ellis Ross Hydration Shampoo</a>, with aloe and honey, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fca%2Fen%2Fproduct%2FP513301"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Fenty Beauty The Rich One Moisture Repair Shampoo</a>, with plant oils and strengthening amino acids.</p>





<p>As long as you’re washing your hair thoroughly as per Kingsley’s advice, you shouldn’t need to enlist a clarifying shampoo every time. But Dobson says that using one every one to two weeks is helpful to remove product build-up, which she says is one of the biggest culprits for making hair appear unclean: “If you’re using styling creams and oils too often, they can leave behind a residue that weighs your hair down and causes it to look greasy,” she says. </p>



<p>Kingsley suggests shampooing twice, using something with the ingredient lauryl betaine, which cleanses deeply without irritating. Try <a href=""https://www.lush.com/us/en_us/p/swell-shampoo/600g"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lush Swell Shampoo, $48</a>, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flovenoughty.com%2Fproducts%2Fpumped-up-volumizing-shampoo"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Noughty Pumped Up Shampoo, $11.99</a>.</p>





<h2>Does conditioner make hair look oily or dirty?</h2>



<p>Assuming you’ve switched up your shampoo routine, your next port of call is rethinking your conditioner, says Dobson: “A conditioner can also be an element of your routine that’s making your hair look greasy,” she says. Conditioners that boast ingredients like moisturizing shea butter, nourishing coconut oil, or shine-enhancing silicones are beneficial for thicker, drier hair, but Dobson says that they can be too heavy for other hair types. “If you have finer hair, a lightweight conditioner — free from silicones — or even just using a leave-in spray post-shower, could be a better option,” says Dobson.</p>



<p>Exactly <em>where</em> you apply your conditioner matters, too: “Do so from the mid-lengths [downwards] rather than directly on your scalp, as it can lead to product build-up,” says Dobson. Kingsley agrees: “To avoid heaviness at the roots, keep conditioner away from the scalp,” she says. “Use it on the lengths and ends of your hair only.” Just be sure you’re rinsing it out properly: “Sometimes people rush this step, which leaves behind traces of product that make your hair look dull and greasy,” says Dobson. Like massaging in your shampoo, aim for a full minute when rinsing away the conditioner. </p>



<h2>Can air-drying your hair make it oily? </h2>



<p>Dobson believes that allowing your hair to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/air-drying-sleeping-wet-hair-mold"">air-dry naturally</a> is not only potentially damaging (this is because hair is at its most fragile and prone to breakage when wet), but it could be a reason why it appears oilier than usual: “When you blow-dry your hair, it disperses the natural oils through the root to tip — and closes the hair cuticle,” she explains. </p>



<p>Kingsley agrees that a gentle blowdry can help smooth down the hair cuticle, making hair more sleek and minimizing tangles. In fact, she prefers not leaving the scalp damp for long periods — and especially not overnight. “[An oil-rich], humid environment can encourage the overgrowth of the yeasts that live naturally on our scalps, potentially triggering dandruff,” says Kingsley. </p>



<p>In other words, there are benefits to blow-drying — even rough-drying — your hair. Just be aware of the temperature: “Excessive heat styling can cause the hair to become brittle and more prone to breakage,” says Kingsley, “so remember to keep the heat setting on medium or low.” She also advises heat protection, whether that’s a lightweight spray for those with fine hair or a moisturizing leave-in product for thicker lengths. </p>

<h2>Will a scalp toner make your hair less oily?</h2>



<p>Besides washing your hair regularly (with the right shampoo for your hair type), and using conditioner sparingly, Kingsley says that topical toners and serums can help to balance the scalp and minimize oil production. She suggests <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.philipkingsley.com%2Fphilip-kingsley-flaky-itchy-scalp-toner-250ml.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Philip Kingsley’s Flaky/Itchy Anti-Dandruff Scalp Toner</a>, with the star ingredient piroctone olamine, which soothes scalp irritation and targets the yeast that causes dandruff. If you use lots of styling products, including dry shampoo, hair oil,s or a particularly thick conditioner or hair mask, consider <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fca%2Fen%2Fproduct%2FP480636"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Inkey List Salicylic Acid Exfoliating Scalp Treatment</a>, with exfoliating salicylic acid to gently chip away at dead skin, oil, and product build-up, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.alpha-h.com%2Fproducts%2Fhealthy-scalp-exfoliating-treatment"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Alpha-H Healthy Hair Exfoliating Treatment</a>, with salicylic and lactic acid to reduce oil and flakes. </p>



<p>On the topic of styling products, it’s easy to go overboard. Start with a small amount and gradually add more if you think your hair needs it.  </p>





<h2>Will a shower filter make hair less oily?</h2>



<p>Lastly, while there is little scientific research to suggest that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/shower-water-filter-skin-hair-benefits"">shower filters</a> are beneficial to prevent oily hair, Dobson believes that your water quality is an important factor in how hair looks after it has been washed: “Hard water contains a high amount of minerals, which often build up on your scalp and make hair feel heavy or look oily, and a shower filter can help with this,” she says.</p>





<p>If you’re intrigued, try the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhelloklean.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fhello-klean-shower-filter%3Fvariant%3D41819539767401"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hello Klean Shower Filter 2.0</a>, which reduces chlorine and heavy metals, or if you have a little more to spend, the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dermstore.com%2Fp%2Fact-acre-showerhead-filter%2F14910052%2F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Act+Acre Showerhead Filter</a>, which makes hard water softer.</p>

<p>If I lost <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charlotte-tilbury-makeup-skincare-review"">my makeup bag</a> today, the first thing I’d replace would be <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/kosas-soulgazer-mascara-review"">my mascara</a>. Even a single slick makes me feel awake and ready to take on the day. It’s why my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/best-beauty-products-2024-innovator-awards"">R29 Beauty Innovator Awards roundup</a> always includes one. In 2024, it was the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fvoluminous-panorama-washable-mascara-pimprod2042577%3Fsku%3D2617241"">L’Oréal Paris Panorama Mascara</a>, and while I won’t reveal this year’s winner just yet, you can bet it’s even better. But my favorite skincare brand, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us"">The Ordinary</a>, might have just convinced me to quit mascara altogether thanks to its latest launch: the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Flash-curl-finisher-100732.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lash Curl Finisher</a>.</p>



<h2>What does The Ordinary’s Lash Curl Finisher do, and what are the benefits?</h2>



<p><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Flash-curl-finisher-100732.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary’s Lash Curl Finisher</a> is a clear, waterless gel designed to coat every lash, even the tiny ones in the corners, lifting and holding your curl for longer. If your lashes tend to fall flat after curling, think of this as invisible scaffolding. Not only does it help to keep your curl in place, but it also gives lashes a natural, glossy finish, like you’re wearing mascara — all without smudges or flakes.</p>



<p>A handful of clever ingredients make it all work. Without getting too technical, you’ll find non-irritating polymers — or film formers — like butylene, ethylene, and dimethicone copolymers, all approved for use around the eyes. They help the gel cling to lashes, provide all-day support for curls, and keep lashes flexible and comfortable, rather than brittle or caked in product. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948337.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>

<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Flash-curl-finisher-100732.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary Lash Curl Finisher, $9.90</a></h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948127.jpg?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Beyond the film formers, you’ll also spot ingredients that have become staples in your skincare routine. Squalane softens and conditions lash hairs and the surrounding skin, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-is-glycerin"">while glycerin</a> deeply moisturizes. Though the main effect is cosmetic, mimicking the effects of an expensive <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/korean-lash-lift-review"">lash lift</a> or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charlotte-tilbury-exaggereyes-mascara-review"">luxury mascara</a>, it also doubles as a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/12/11243440/keratin-lash-lift-tint-review"">lash treatment</a>.</p>



<h2>How do you use The Ordinary’s Lash Curl Finisher, and is it any good?</h2>



<p>I use the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Flash-curl-finisher-100732.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lash Curl Finisher</a> just like mascara. First, I curl my lashes with my trusty <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Feyelash-curler-P244437"">Shiseido Eyelash Curler</a> (an imperative step, according to The Ordinary), then I apply it in coats. But make no mistake: this isn’t like the clear mascaras of the ’00s that did nothing but make lashes feel rock hard. This actually makes them look thicker thanks to the lustrous sheen it leaves behind. It’s not quite a wet look, but it’s not invisible, either. If you touch your lashes, they feel slightly tacky before drying — and it’s this texture that keeps them upright, like your curled lashes are preserved (in a gentle way). </p>



<p>You might’ve seen the <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@jacquelinekilikita/video/7094220545536953606?lang"">Vaseline lash lift hack</a> on TikTok, where people use petroleum jelly instead of mascara for a no-makeup lash look. <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@jacquelinekilikita/video/7094220545536953606?lang"">I’ve tried it myself</a>, and it works well, but because Vaseline is so soft, it keeps lashes almost wet. The Ordinary’s Lash Curl Finisher, on the other hand, dries down, making it more transfer-proof than petroleum jelly.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948339.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>

<p>The curved brush also makes it easier to capture each lash, and I’m convinced that both the shape and thickness of the wand give my curls an extra boost, keeping them perky. Honestly, a couple of coats of this is infinitely better at thickening my lashes than a single coat of mascara. Of course, I have dark lashes, so I’m not exactly certain how it would perform on blondes or redheads, but the product does make them appear darker — like I’m wearing black mascara.</p>



<p>My lashes stay curled — with a very slight drop, as is natural — until I remove the product at the end of the day. I just use a cleansing balm, but micellar water or a foaming cleanser works just as well, since the product doesn’t need much effort to dissolve — nothing like the scrubbing mascara can require. </p>



<p>While The Ordinary doesn’t specifically recommend this use, I run the wand through my brows, too, and it works just as brilliantly as a brow gel, keeping my thick hairs perfectly in place.</p>

<p>I have a confession to make. And it’s the kind I can only say now, in my thirties, after <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/motherhood-experiences"">having a child</a> and after finding and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/latinas-redefining-marriage-traditions"">marrying</a> an incredible man: I love my husband. I love our life. And I love our daughter. But if we ever divorced, I would never get married again.</p>



<p>It’s not because marriage has failed me. Javy and I met during the middle of the pandemic (remember 2020?) on the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/latine-dating-apps-successful-stories-couples"">Latino dating app Chispa</a>, and we’ve been attached ever since. We dated for six months before moving in together, and we got married in Las Vegas in 2023, when I was already three months pregnant. He’s a great partner and father. He works two full-time jobs, and still teaches our daughter how to count in Spanish and helps out during bath time. It truly feels like I’ve found a diamond in the rough. </p>



<p>But five years later, I now understand what the real <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/this-is-the-surprising-cost-of-being-in-a-relationship"">cost of partnership</a> looks like and what marriage asks for. And if I ever had to rebuild my life from scratch, I simply would not hand all of that over to someone else again.</p>



<p>Marriage, even the good kind, demands things from women that it doesn’t equally demand from men. No, I don’t mean the often-physical labor of keeping a house or raising a family, though, according to the <a href=""https://thegepi.org/the-free-time-gender-gap/"">Gender Equity Policy Institute</a>, heterosexual women perform twice the amount of childcare and household work as their male counterparts<em>. </em>But for many women, that can be the tip of the invisible labor iceberg: How you plan your day with someone else’s schedule factored in and how you approach bills and major life decisions — it all changes with another autonomous person’s thoughts, hopes, and limitations thrown into the mix. <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/staying-sane-inside-insanity/202204/is-marriage-a-bad-deal-for-women?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">Psychology Today</a> revealed that women end marriages not only because of abuse or infidelity, but also because “the relationship is no longer worth the sacrifices required of them.” Turns out, the emotional labor, lack of empathy from partners, and unequal effort are just some of the reasons many women walk away.<em> </em></p>



<p>Historically, marriage has been an institution built on women’s sacrifice, emotionally, socially, and even legally. For generations, women have swallowed our needs, softened our ambitions, and built our identities around care: care for our partners, our home, our children, and everyone else before us. And for Latinas, in particular, who were often raised in cultures where love is shown through service, where “familia primero”<em> </em>isn’t a suggestion but a moral code, it’s frighteningly easy to slip into roles our mothers and grandmothers carried, even when we swore we never would. And it’s not because we’re weak but rather because the world still subconsciously expects it, praises it, and labels anything less as selfish.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Historically, marriage has been an institution built on women’s sacrifice, emotionally, socially, and even legally.”</p><cite>Paulina Roe</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>I went into marriage thinking I understood partnership, but once the cake was eaten and the honeymoon was over, I realized how much of my life had become work to keep <em>our lives</em> functioning. The calendar-keeping, the appointments, the remembering, the meal-planning, and the million invisible decisions that keep a household running — it all fell on me by default. I carried it convincing myself it was normal and every partnership goes through this. And part of that came from my culture. I married a loving, devoted Latino man who was raised in a world where men are applauded for “helping.” And I’m a Latina raised with the same script: be strong, but also be accommodating. Build a life, but also carry everyone else’s.</p>



<p>This isn’t how things are for us anymore. Eventually, we talked it over and agreed that we’re not continuing that cycle. Not in our marriage and not for our daughter. And slowly, things shifted. Not perfectly, but intentionally. Today, he carries his share of both the parenting and day-to-day responsibilities.</p>



<p>“Marriage isn’t always 50/50,” <a href=""https://www.waytoknowthyself.com"">Stella Barrutia, LCSW,</a> a Licensed Clinical Social Worker based in Chicago, tells Refinery29 Somos. “Some days, it’s 80/20. Other days, it’s 20/80. When the foundation is truly love and respect, the balance will always realign. The challenge is that many women are taught, implicitly or explicitly, that once they’re married, they must continue doing everything for themselves — and now also for their husbands and children.”</p>



<p>Barrutia, whose work is bicultural and includes a focus on Latine experiences, added that “honest conversations about partnership, roles, ambitions, and expectations are absolutely essential” when it comes to choosing a life partner. In other words, the day-to-day setup of marriage and partnership can be imperfect while the relationship itself is deeply loving. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“For Latinas, in particular, who were often raised in cultures where love is shown through service, where “familia primero”isn’t a suggestion but a moral code, it’s frighteningly easy to slip into roles our mothers and grandmothers carried, even when we swore we never would.”</p><cite>Paulina Roe</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>My critique is of the structure, not with the man I chose. Javy is a great partner and a great father, and I’m so grateful for him. He fully supports my career and business, cares for our family to make sure we never go without, and shows up when life gets heavy. He brings steadiness into our lives. Just last week, after a 24-hour shift at the firehouse, he walked in, took our baby out of her crib when she woke up at 7 a.m., and fed her breakfast, did the whole routine, and let me sleep without ever making it seem like a favor.</p>



<p>But marriage as an institution? It’s complicated and, based on current trends, is becoming outdated.</p>



<p>Here’s the reality: Americans are <a href=""https://usafacts.org/articles/state-relationships-marriages-and-living-alone-us/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">getting married way less</a> and much later than previous generations. The marriage rate in the U.S. has dropped by more than 50% since the early 1900s, and only about 1 in 5 people in their mid-20s today has ever been married, the lowest level ever recorded. People of all genders aren’t rushing down the aisle anymore, and instead are taking their time, building careers, and figuring out who they are before they sign up for that kind of commitment.</p>



<p>And the myth that marriage is the only path to stability? Well, that’s gone, too. Latinas, and women in general, are now earning <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2024/05/15/how-latinas-educational-and-economic-situation-has-changed-in-the-last-two-decades/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">more college degrees</a> than men, and we’re showing up in spaces our mothers and abuelas could only dream about. Financial independence has shifted the power dynamic, too. And to add to that, women are delaying motherhood (I had my first baby at 31), choosing different family structures, and rejecting the idea that being a wife or a mother has to define your entire identity. </p>



<p>Many of us grew up watching our mothers carry the emotional load, the childcare, the cooking, everything — and now we’re refusing to recreate what drained the women before us.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Many women — and especially Latinas — grew up watching generations of women carry their marriages on their backs. So even when they’re ambitious, educated, and financially independent, there’s a learned fear that marriage will shrink them. They’re afraid that choosing partnership means choosing limitations. That’s not because women are unsure of themselves; it’s because the institution still carries expectations rooted in another era.”</p><cite>Stella Barrutia, LCSW</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“Many women — and especially Latinas — grew up watching generations of women carry their marriages on their backs,” Barrutia notes. “So even when they’re ambitious, educated, and financially independent, there’s a learned fear that marriage will shrink them. They’re afraid that choosing partnership means choosing limitations. That’s not because women are unsure of themselves; it’s because the institution still carries expectations rooted in another era.” </p>



<p>Barrutia continues: “When women ask, ‘Can I be ambitious and married?’ they’re really asking, ‘Is there room for all of me here? Healthy partnership answers that with a yes. But culturally, many haven’t seen that model reflected back to them.”</p>



<p>True, these ambitions can feel a little less isolating when you have a partner cheering you on. Javy supports my dreams in the ways that actually matter. When work gets intense, he picks up what I can’t. When I’m building <a href=""http://themamicollective.com"">The Mami Collective,</a> he steps in with childcare, dinner, and whatever else needs to be done. He asks how he can help before I say I’m overwhelmed. He celebrates my wins with me. He makes space for my goals. And, most importantly, he shares the invisible load so it’s not all on me. Because that’s partnership: not perfect, not 50/50, just two people choosing to show up for each other.</p>



<p>Yet, even still, it often feels like the contours of marriage are constrained by outdated and ever-present expectations. </p>



<p>When writer Chanté Joseph posed the question <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/article/is-having-a-boyfriend-embarrassing-now"">“Is Having a Boyfriend Embarrassing Now?” </a>for <em>Vogue</em> in October, I noticed something interesting in the Instagram comments and the surrounding discourse. By and large, respondents echoed the same sentiment: I love my partner, but sometimes I fantasize about the freedom I’d have if I didn’t have to factor someone else into every corner of my life. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“We miss the unshared version of ourselves — the woman who had her own schedule, her own thoughts, her own orbit. Wanting that again isn’t selfish. It’s a sign you’re still in touch with who you are. That’s the difference.”</p><cite>PAULINA ROE</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Not because we want our partners gone, but because we want ourselves back. We miss the unshared version of ourselves — the woman who had her own schedule, her own thoughts, her own orbit. Wanting that again isn’t selfish. It’s a sign you’re still in touch with who you are. That’s the difference.</p>



<p>So when I say I wouldn’t get married again, I’m not saying that I’m rushing to divorce my husband. In fact, when I told him I wouldn’t get married again, he didn’t spiral. He lifted his eyebrows and said, “Honestly? I get it.” We’ve talked about how marriage hits differently for women and how the mental load and expectations pile up even in the healthiest partnerships. He knows I love him; he also knows the institution asks more of me than it ever will of him. His reaction wasn’t defensive. It was honest, a little uncomfortable, and very, “Yeah, you’re not wrong.”</p>



<p>I’m not married because of fear, tradition, or cultural pressure. I’m in it because I choose to be. Because this specific partnership works for me. Because the love and respect are mutual and because my husband makes the sacrifices with me, not just for him.</p>



<p>But if the water were to rise and hell were to freeze over, I wouldn’t do it over again. Not the white dress, not the bridal shower, not the honeymoon. I’m not interested in further contributing to a narrative in which a Latina’s value is tied to having a partner. I’ve worked my butt off to build my life, career, and identity. I don’t need to rebuild it all over again.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“My marriage is one of the most beautiful parts of my life, but it also taught me exactly how much of myself it takes to build a partnership that works. If I ever had to rebuild again, I’d do it as me: Paulina Roe. Because that’s enough.”</p><cite>PAULINA ROE</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>This clarity can be powerful. It helps me show up intentionally in my marriage today — not because I fear divorce, but because I understand what marriage takes from the both of us. A good marriage takes honest conversations about the hard things, even when they’re uncomfortable. And it takes partners choosing effort and accountability on purpose, because the relationship deserves it.</p>



<p>My marriage is one of the most beautiful parts of my life, but it also taught me exactly how much of myself it takes to build a partnership that works. If I ever had to rebuild again, I’d do it as me: Paulina Roe. Because that’s enough. I’d want to keep the version of me that survived. The woman who rebuilt her identity not as a wife or mother, but as herself.</p>



<p>On <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8UrKksq/"">TikTok</a>, many women have expressed feeling similarly. “I love my husband, but marriage still asks more of me than it does of him,” Diana Lopez, a 34-year-old Mexican-American mother of two based in Chicago, said. “I don’t want out, I just want room to breathe, to grow, and to still be my own person. Wanting yourself back isn’t a threat to your relationship — it’s a sign you’re finally paying attention to what you need.”</p>



<p>And why is that? Because we’re finally being honest about the price of partnership, even when it’s good.</p>



<p>And we’re asking ourselves: If I ever had to pay that price again, would I?<br /><br /></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glass-french-nails-manicure-trend"">Glass nails</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-nail-manicure-trends-2025"">cat-eye textures</a> have been huge this year, and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DCpFxs2u3ws/"">Aistė Haas’</a> interpretation of the trend feels special enough for New Year’s Eve. The deep color palette means the finish doesn’t feel too OTT, but you could mix-and-match the shades depending on which outfit you’re wearing.</p>
