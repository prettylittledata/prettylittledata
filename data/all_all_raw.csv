<p>Aristotle is credited with the proverb ""One swallow does not make a summer."" In nature, the arrival of these migratory birds often announces the change of seasons, a universal symbol of renewal and hope. Yet it is only when many take flight that the true warmth of summer begins. The same can happen in architecture: an isolated project, however exemplary, rarely changes a reality on its own. When, however, a work teaches, inspires, and can be replicated, it becomes the harbinger of something greater.</p>",

The family's brief was to create a generational home nurturing togetherness, balancing intimacy with openness. The home has a dual personality, externally a modern architectural figurine punctuated with greens, while internally adorned with ancestral Parsi heirlooms. The house seeks a dialogue between landscape and built form, wherein the verandahs and balconies become pivotal transient spaces in the tropics. Unlike a monolith, the home unfolds as three distinct masses, woven by delicate passages. These passages are not merely corridors but breathing voids, bringing in light and air, framing picture-perfect views of immediate greens.</p>",

<p>Concrete, steel, wood, glass. Every year, millions of tons of construction materials are discarded, piled up in landfills, and silenced beneath the weight of the next building. Entire structures disappear to make way for others, restarting a voracious cycle of resource extraction, material production, and replacement. Along with the debris that accumulates, something deeper is also lost: time, human labor, stories, and the collective memory embedded in matter. At a time when climate goals demand reducing emissions and extending the lifespan of what already exists, demolition is increasingly recognized as a form of urban amnesia, one that erases not only cultural continuity but also the embodied energy of buildings. And even though it is often said that the most sustainable building is the one that already exists, that principle rarely survives when other interests come into play.</p>",

<h3>How to nail onboarding — a case study of Runna</h3><h4>Lessons in clarity, confidence and community</h4><p>Nearly <a href=""https://www.runna.com/en-gb/strava-acquires-runna"">1 billion runs</a> were recorded on Strava in 2024.</p><p>Targeting runners is a <em>big</em> market.</p><p>And it’s a market that’s growing — according to <a href=""https://www.runna.com/en-gb/strava-acquires-runna"">Strava</a>, running was the ‘fastest growing sport globally’ with ‘Gen Z turning to running to create community and connection’.</p><p>Which is the <strong>winning strategy</strong> for coaching app <a href=""https://www.runna.com/"">Runna</a>.</p><p>If you run, you’ve probably heard of Runna. The consumer app is<em> all over</em> Instagram, TikTok, and Strava, with 48,000+ ratings at 4.9 stars on the app store. The <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/runna/"">Reddit community</a> alone now has around <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/runna/"">47,000 members</a>.</p><p>Officially launching in March 2022, Runna reached <a href=""https://www.standard.co.uk/news/tech/strava-acquires-popular-runna-app-b1222946.html"">7,000 paying subscribers</a> a year later and has since helped <a href=""https://www.runna.com/en-gb/strava-acquires-runna"">millions of runners complete their first race</a>.</p><p>In April 2025, Runna was acquired by Stava for an unknown amount. Though <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/seb-johnson_strava-runna-crowdfunding-activity-7324024883418382336-xTC2?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACEru7kB8-Anzw-Z0Ee3-GIgCyW6sGkmrp0"">estimates</a> are around £150 million, based on a 30X return to early crowdfunding investors, who invested when it was valued at £5 million (30 X £5M = £150M).</p><p>That’s when I decided to see what all the hype was about.</p><p>The acquisition caught my eye, and so did the fact that my friends had just signed me up for a half-marathon 🫠 As a Strava paying subscriber, I got the email about a Strava × Runna bundle, it made sense to give it a go.</p><p>And this is that story: <strong>my journey through Runna’s incredible onboarding.</strong></p><p>We’ll see three big lessons across the onboarding flow, covering:</p><ul><li>Why most product marketing tests fail to have an impact, but Runna’s packs a punch</li><li>Where user-generated content and community can come into onboarding</li><li>How certain industries need a longer onboarding process</li></ul><p>By the end we’ll see that there’s nothing flashy about Runna’s onboarding. It just makes you believe you can actually <strong>do it.</strong></p><p>We’ll also see just how well I ran according to my plan 👀</p><p>Let’s jump straight into lesson one, starting from the first thing we see: a welcome screen carousel.</p><h3>Lesson 1) Show your product clearly</h3><p>Most apps try to look impressive. Runna just tries to make sense.</p><p>When I open the app on my phone for the first time, I see an onboarding carousel which looks slightly old-school, but I love it.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*puktDueirGzA1V4APH4rLw.png"" /></figure><p>The classic saying is that ‘no one reads an onboarding carousel’.</p><p>Which, in my experience is <strong><em>half true.</em></strong></p><p>Studies have shown users don’t have time to read: most people read <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-little-do-users-read/"">28% of the words on a page; 20% is more likely</a>.</p><p><em>However, </em>I’ve added a carousel before a paywall before and it <em>improved</em> conversion to trial. So there’s something to be said for adding extra context for customers.</p><p>In my view, Runna’s carousel works here. It does three things really well:</p><ul><li>It runs through screens like an Instagram story (no tapping required)</li><li>There’s very few words (max 9 in each headline)</li><li>Imagery does the heavy lifting</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tM4tOfgJx7KE-v_icAgRAw.png"" /></figure><p>The Instagram-style story creates a <strong>variable reward</strong> 🧠 as you don’t know what’s coming next. It also follows a common consumer app <strong>mental model</strong> which works well in this context.</p><p>What stands out here is the <strong>imagery. </strong>From the second carousel screenshot, it’s clear to me what a ‘personalized running plan’ might look like.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/499/1*7qWurLh6N8_B45Bv4qJEOA.png"" /></figure><p>As someone who gets injured all the time and has no real game plan for running, this structure, clarity and format made me sigh with relief.</p><p>It created a mini-magic-moment for me early on.</p><p>On the fourth screenshot, my running injuries came to life:</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/499/1*VQ2LUfE70GJusdfKNW-u9w.png"" /></figure><p>Runna has used the most common running injury (Achilles Tendinitis) as an example, with micro copy:</p><ul><li>Get back to running quickly and carefully</li><li>Returning to running post-injury</li></ul><p>They know that this is one of the biggest fears, frustrations, or anxieties that holds people back from running. Whether it’s past injuries or future injuries, with these images, Runna is signalling:</p><blockquote>We’ve got you</blockquote><p>Does this impact conversion? Hard to say. My gut says no.</p><p>In my experience, I’ve rarely seen adding imagery into onboarding improve conversion.</p><p>That’s because it’s<strong> really hard to do well.</strong> You need to have excellent image designers and really think about what will make people have a lightbulb moment. Imagery needs to be:</p><ul><li>Easy to scan, easy to see</li><li>Use specific, real examples</li><li>Be able to be understood in a moment’s glance</li></ul><p>That’s a tough order.</p><h3>Lesson 2) Bring your marketing inside your product</h3><p>Runna’s onboarding starts long before download. Its community and content seep straight into the product journey.</p><p>The first obvious thing I noticed is the authentic lifestyle imagery and social proof throughout the flow.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5n9jr3CzhOEc7aiLPyEktQ.png"" /></figure><p>After the carousel, I see a load of smiling women and men I want to be friends with sitting on a park bench.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/499/1*DvwkS7kpHdoUDI7J1U0WBg.png"" /></figure><p>Further into onboarding, after I select the run I’m doing, I see 230 other little avatars ready to run with me.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1023/1*LOg_JV9KEuFVRq41hmpqPg.png"" /></figure><p>There are little signals of value add here too:</p><ul><li>Date</li><li>Location</li><li>Run type = flat (thank god)</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/499/1*wm1VAYBXUyTxYs3kAjXI6w.png"" /></figure><p>Before this onboarding flow, I hadn’t checked the run route for the run I’d booked.</p><p>With these details (flat ‘elevation of 34 meters’ &amp; ‘230 others running’), the app has calmed some anxieties around being fit enough for hills and showed me other’s are doing it too. Quietly reassuring me:</p><blockquote>You got this</blockquote><p>And it continues…</p><p>At the end of onboarding, I see more runners 👀</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YYOQw1UL4xBai1_8GeXp5w.png"" /></figure><p>Notice how the human imagery varies:</p><ul><li>Full screen vs. small avatars vs. videos</li><li>Stylised shoots, vs ‘taken on the run’ vibes</li><li>Background gradient fade or spotlight image</li></ul><p>What’s curious is that these touch points are littered throughout. There are 30 screens I see in onboarding before I see my plan on the homepage.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*J3X4-NZI_xa3b0Sf1xD3DA.png"" /><figcaption>Too many to show…</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s a summary (as I know the above image is too small 🥴):</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4PRtTKhECrLY6nme_4v-BA.png"" /></figure><p>In terms of where the imagery sits, there’s imagery beginning, middle (almost) and end of onboarding. With a big cluster near the paywall.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZAcO9G_OXxNKMnYNtNc8ew.png"" /></figure><p>What I see here: a product direction that<strong> knows community is important.</strong> And an onboarding funnel that matches the acquisition funnel (influencer marketing, user-generated content in ads, reddit communities).</p><p>Whilst hard to execute, I’ve heard of experiments showing that matching ad creative and copy at the top of the funnel to the product journey, from onboarding to homepage, can improve conversion to paid and retention.</p><h3>Lesson 3) Design for confidence, not speed</h3><p>Everyone has fears.</p><p>My fears are around running (and the dark).</p><p>The key doubts on my mind coming into this were:</p><ul><li>Can I run this run I’ve booked?</li><li>Will my old injuries resurface?</li><li>Will I get new injuries?</li><li>Will I get faster? Can I run under 2 hours?</li><li>Can I fit this into my work week?</li><li>Will this app work with my garmin and strava set up?</li></ul><p>By the end of my 12-minute-long onboarding, <strong>I’m clear on all of the above.</strong> And honestly, I felt pretty relaxed about it all.</p><p>The hard part of testing onboarding is balancing two things:</p><ol><li>The macro steps (getting you set up, called ‘set up tasks’)</li><li>The micro details that aren’t crucial, but subconsciously push people along.</li></ol><p>On 1. it’s incredibly hard to prioritise what to put in onboarding. As a rule of thumb, if it positively impacts retention (i.e. when people take [product action] we see they retain better) then AB test it in onboarding to see if it’s a causal relationship, not just a correlation.</p><p>On 2, it’s even harder to make decisions of what small details to add. What micro copy will calm users, what images can help.</p><p>Individual, isolated tests rarely reach significance on these things. And if you’re not close to the customer, you can end up just adding words, steps and noise that get in the way.</p><p>For Runna, the macro steps are:</p><ul><li>Set a goal</li><li>Pick a race</li><li>Self select your running ability</li><li>What days would you like to run?</li><li>Predict your running time</li><li>Pick km/mi</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JjhBVSRr0-X7G7LFa3ho1Q.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*I1lhv5RHBbl39pfasKIVXw.png"" /></figure><p>From the copy on these steps, my anxieties around fitting the plan into my week, running a good pace and ‘will I be ready’ for my half marathon are covered.</p><p>Then it’s the micro details that add confidence. If I pick a 5k time that’s too fast, it tells me the app isn’t built for me.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tUtqzyLnTVHxJ331tvHseA.png"" /></figure><p>Which reinforces that I am in the right place, because I cannot run that fast (but I hope to one day).</p><p>The post-onboarding plan introduction takes the level of confidence one step further, with:</p><ul><li>Estimated race times</li><li>A guide to the four run types (with a coach video explainer for each)</li><li>The first of those workouts reflected in my plan (starting with an easy run, yay)</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zNKuHeM-Nmnap_J2VBUhTQ.png"" /></figure><p>The estimated times show me what I can achieve with and without the app:</p><ul><li>Without Runna: 1hr 59</li><li>With Runna: 8 minutes faster (1hr 51)</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/499/1*QwN9Bx5EWYFs__WJnbE2vg.png"" /></figure><p>Again imagery being used here to show value at a glance.</p><p>Lastly, the copy on ‘Types of run’ guides is just so simple.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HsjiGLuHHfonj-q2q5hsvQ.png"" /></figure><blockquote>‘The purpose of these runs is to recover and freshen up’</blockquote><p>No jargon, no running-speak. None of that elite language that puts people off.</p><p>Just plain old english. And again, none of it feels optimised. It’s just plain and simple.</p><p>Bish bash bosh.</p><h3>The summary: confidence is what Runna is optimizing for.</h3><p>By the time I finished onboarding, I hadn’t even started training but already felt more confident about the race.</p><p>Thinking back over this flow, the funny thing is that it isn’t particularly <em>sexy</em>. Runna doesn’t try to impress me.</p><p>Instead, every choice — from unhurried pacing to clear copy — signals that this app is serious about getting you to your goal.</p><p>It feels like the restraint on product sexiness or pazazz, and the focus on plain and simple, is what earns trust.</p><p>The irony is that this onboarding doesn’t just onboard you into an app. It onboards you into <strong>believing you can actually run the thing.</strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=7780ba89c202"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-nail-onboarding-a-case-study-of-runna-7780ba89c202"">How to nail onboarding — a case study of Runna</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Inset is the little baby redwood tree I planted in my backyard.</figcaption></figure><p>Time is money. Move fast and break things. Crunch time. We hear these idioms repeated, and to many, they become true. You can live your life by these sayings if you like.</p><p>I prefer:</p><blockquote>“Time is a fluid condition which has no existence except in the momentary avatars of individual people. — Virginia Woolf”</blockquote><p>Woolf seemed to recognize the spectrum on which time exists — its fluidity. Importantly, that time centers around humanity, because we track it. We frame it in terms of its past, present, and future. We observe its passage.</p><p>My preference doesn’t mean I don’t need a calendar. I desperately do. But some days I wish I didn’t. :) Time is something I’ve been thinking about quite a bit these days. As AI seems to be moving quite quickly, my children have grown into near-adults, and as I age, things seem to be moving faster. They’re not, but they seem to be.</p><p>If you’ve ever been in a car accident, time seems to slow down, while spending time with good friends can seem to move quickly. Temporal perception should feel familiar to everyone. There are numerous papers on this topic; <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03196844"">this one</a> provides a good breakdown, but <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-H4MKJSRXs"">this video</a> by David Eagleman is less dense. Eagleman experiments with time and proves that time doesn’t slow down, but your memory, triggered by your amygdala, captures the novelty of traumatic events “to attend to the situation at hand.” Memories are created in a kind of second memory system that you may need in the future to avoid or deal with the trauma at hand. So your brain has more memories to draw from, and you perceive time as elongating. Neuroscience is neat. Watch the video; his explanation is better than mine.</p><p>Depending on where you grew up, your cultural understanding of time may also differ.</p><p><em>“In general, Monochronic cultures view time as linear and separable, capable of being divided into units, and therefore emphasize doing ‘one thing at a time’. In contrast, Polychronic cultures view time as naturally recurring, and therefore emphasize doing ‘many things at one time.” Nonis, Teng, Ford 2005</em></p><p>The above definition is based on <em>Edward T. Hall’s 1959 book, The Silent Language. </em>Even though these binary stereotypes aren’t universal, studies support the assertion that place plays a role in how you perceive time, despite the difficulty in measuring these differences and their dependencies on context. (<a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273382690_Cross-cultural_Perspectives_on_Time"">Fulmer, Crosby, and Gelfand — 2014)</a></p><p>One context is the work you do. Your job affects your sense of time. I imagine that Paramedics and Quarterbacks likely think in <strong>seconds and minutes</strong>. If a patient goes into cardiac arrest, there seems to be an immediacy of action that other jobs lack.</p><p>The technology people that I’ve spent my career with…Product Managers and Software Developers, think in terms of <strong>weeks, sprints, and quarters.</strong> Our planning cycles contain deadlines, iterations, and launches. Even the CEO’s I’ve worked with often keep their time scales in shorter cycles as the technology can change quickly.</p><p>Urban Planners and Architects think in longer terms — <strong>years and decades.</strong> The scale of the work they do requires more time, and therefore, they have longer-term perspectives. The new Eastern span of the Bay Bridge in the SF Bay area took over a decade to complete and several years in planning since the impetus was the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.</p><p>Few people think in <strong>centuries or millennia</strong>, but among them are Historians, Archaeologists, and Climate Scientists. Problems like the Climate Crisis, which affect us all, suggest that humanity has to step away from the numerous constructs that have affected the way we think about time and collectively shift to thinking more long-term. <br /> <br />This conclusion led me to wonder how many people I knew take a long-term view, and the answer was very few. Then I thought of Alexander Rose, who has spent his career thinking about the long-term.</p><p>I met Rose at Burning Man in 1999. His part of our camp was called Antarctica. He’d brought an 18-wheeler freezer truck out to the desert, and the idea was to crank up the air conditioning, have a DJ play music, and serve hot chocolate in this mobile club. It was delightful. He’d joined the Long Now Foundation in 1997 and worked there till 2024. He’s Director Emeritus at the Foundation and continues to consult on the Clock project, but he’s currently the Director of Long-term Futures at <a href=""https://automattic.com/"">Automattic</a>. That’s almost 30 years where his efforts had been focused entirely on long-term thinking, AND doing so by engaging in or starting <a href=""https://longnow.org/projects/"">numerous projects</a>. The <strong>Rosetta Project,</strong> for instance, is a global collaboration of language specialists and native speakers working to build a publicly accessible digital library of human languages. <strong>The Manual for Civilization</strong> is a set of 3500 books that would help restart civilization (in case things go awry). I’ve attended numerous talks at the events they set up, and visited the Interval, a lovely bar they built that serves as both a place for drinks and a community space.</p><p>All of these projects are impressive individually, but together they form a collective to support the idea that we humans need to think about the long-term.</p><p>Among these projects is <strong>The Clock of the Long Now</strong>. What is that? Well, it’s a clock designed to function for 10,000 years (or more) that is, “An immense mechanical monument, installed in a mountain, designed to keep accurate time for the next ten millennia. The 10,000-year clock is hundreds of feet tall, engineered to require minimal maintenance, and powered by mechanical energy harvested from sunlight.” Its purpose? The official answer is: “The Clock provides a rare invitation to think and engineer at the timescale of civilization. It offers an enduring symbol of our personal connection to the distant future.”</p><figure><img alt=""This is the face of the Clock of the Long-Now.

Not all things, of course, but for those things that require long-term thinking, the clock<em> </em>is a persistent reminder that some things take a long time. Like the Redwoods I planted in my backyard — inset pictured above.</p><p>Also, it’s arguably the equivalent in terms of human achievement to Stonehenge or the Pyramids. <strong>Wow!</strong> <br /> <br /> I reached out and had a lovely conversation with Rose.</p><p><strong>Dave: </strong>Tell me about your background.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> I grew up on the Sausalito waterfront in what was literally a junkyard with a bunch of hippies and artists. I grew up building things and basically wanted to be an inventor, but inventor schools don’t exist, so I thought Architecture was the way to go. I realized it wasn’t for me, and found Industrial Design at Carnegie Mellon. It’s one of the oldest programs in the country, and when I joined, I was very much looking forward to it being hands-on. When I started, they’d hired a new Dean who was very much into rhetoric, so after arguing with him on a relatively constant basis, he bumped me forward a year, and my degree took three years. I graduated in 1994. Afterwards, I moved back to the Bay Area and worked for LucasArts and Chrysler.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Me too. I also have an Industrial Design degree, but started working on web stuff when I moved to the Bay Area. What got you into the Long Now work?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> I had been through a few cycles of the game development, and the days were long, but then we’d ship, and then nothing. They don’t need you at all, like a movie production. So I reached out to Stewart Brand, whom I knew growing up, and he told me about the conversations he was having around Long-term Thinking. That we’re living in a world that has long-term consequences like climate change, hunger, education…you name it…but our mechanisms aren’t set up to handle them. Strangely, benevolent dictators do this better, but those are few and far between.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Super few of those on the benevolent front, yeah. :)</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Yes, and Democracy, with its four-year election cycle, is particularly bad at this. How do you incentivize lawmakers to care about something 20 years from now when they won’t get the credit for it? Stewart introduced me to Danny Hillis, who started Thinking Machines…</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> I worked for Brewster Kahle, who worked for Danny!</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Right, so that’s how you ended up with our mutual friend at Burning Man in ‘99.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> That’s right. :)</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> So Danny Hillis is a computer scientist out of MIT, and he wrote an article for Wired in 1995. In it, he outlined his <a href=""https://www.wired.com/1995/12/the-millennium-clock/"">idea for the clock</a>. He and a number of people had been cooking up the Long Now Foundation through the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Business_Network"">Global Business Network</a>. Steward set me up with several interviews, one that eventually led to the game company Blizzard, and the other was with his own newly founded project, Long Now. Even though the gaming industry offered more money, I really liked the idea of a 10000-year clock. I joined in 1997.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> I know the Long Now Foundation has worked on a bunch of things, and not just the clock, but can you give me a brief background on the clock?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> We built the first prototype that we took to TED. It debuted on New Year’s Eve 2000 in the Presidio at the Internet Archive offices, and then we shipped it to the <a href=""https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co531554/first-prototype-of-the-clock-of-the-long-now-1999"">Science Museum in London</a>. Then we built two more, one at the Interval in San Francisco and one for Nathan Myhrvold. I’d met Jeff Bezos at TED after he funded another one of our projects called Long Bets in 2001, and then he and Danny became friends. He was scouting sites for Blue Origin and came to our Nevada site for the clock, and we hiked together, and we all became friends. Bezos offered to fund the full-scale clock at a site he had in Texas, as the site we were looking to use in Nevada had several environmental challenges around access and elevation. Concurrently, many other projects were happening at Long Now. The Rosetta project, The Interval I mentioned, all the talks we’ve had. So now, we’re close to finishing many aspects of the clock, and I realized I didn’t want to administer a non-profit or raise money for the rest of my life. So I started doing research into how to hand off this first generation of work and create something multi-generational.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> I read the <a href=""https://longnow.org/clock/faq/"">2024 Hillis FAQ</a> on the Clock. Where are you now?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Well, everything is installed. The clock is made up of modules stacked up 500 feet high, and while each module worked, we hadn’t had the whole thing assembled, so that’s what’s happening now. There are still some details to be dealt with, which we will hopefully be able to talk about soon.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Hillis mentions in the FAQs that it’s a work in progress.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Yeah. There are a couple of things that will be left undone on purpose, but we’ve provided a kind of API, as it were. There are these anniversary chambers that are driven by the clock…an annual, a decade, a century, a millennium, and a ten-millennium one. The first has been commissioned, and we will hopefully do the decade one, but we’ll leave the others for future generations.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> That’s really interesting. I read recently that the best way to think about the future is to establish institutions that will address the future, and yet our current regime is trying to dismantle the future as fast as it can.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> The pendulum of justice usually swings in the right direction. :)</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> The moral arc of the universe…</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> We have these times that are tough to live through for sure, and they can take a very long time, but we hope that’s not the case. We might lose some stuff along the way, and then we’ll have to recreate those things.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> A super smart Designer I know, Bob Baxley says, “Look, they’ll destroy and the younger generation will build,” so he’s got a really hopeful view.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> If there’s one lesson that I got out of Long Now and studying long-term thinking, it’s that the very best way to think long-term is to give more optionality to the future. That you’re trusting the future to have more information on their present than you could project onto them from the past. They are going to make better decisions unless you have taken away their ability to make a decision. If you chop down all the old-growth redwoods, no one ever gets to decide about old-growth redwoods again for a thousand years. This is why the Pace Layers diagram is really good. If you’re chopping down these Redwoods and you’re doing it on the commercial layer. In that case, you’ve skipped Governance and Culture (and of course Nature — SIDE NOTE: If you’re unfamiliar with <a href=""https://longnow.org/ideas/pace-layers/"">Pace Layers</a>, go check it out. Rose drew the diagram we’re all familiar with as an expression of Brands and many others’ thinking.)</p><figure><img alt=""Pace Layers is a diagram that depicts a series of curved lines vertically oriented (almost like a closeup cross -section) with a series of labels from top to bottom showing Fashion (with an additional squiggly line), Commerce, Infrastructure, Governance, Culture, and Nature — each with an arrow moving off to the right."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IiD6hj6_X7FaD7mYaLUcNA.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram of Pace Layers</figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://longnow.org/ideas/pace-layers/"">https://longnow.org/ideas/pace-layers/</a></p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Does trust play a role here?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Absolutely. It’s about trusting the future, but it’s not what’s happening in our legislature right now. The Bill of Rights (the first ten amendments to the US Constitution) is excellent because they’re short. They’re principles to follow, rather than the 1000 pages of laws that no one reads.</p><p>(for example, the First Amendment — Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.)</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> They’re almost memetic representations. It’s a shame that some folks have boiled down the Second Amendment to “Don’t take my guns,” and it’s an easy thing to repeat.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> It’s a good example because they (the founders) should have left it more open to the principle and not about the object — the people should be allowed to defend themselves and leave that open to interpretation because what they didn’t know is that there’d be, you know, ICBMs and tanks. A lot fewer people would be dead.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> That’s true, and that mentality just seems so hopeless. You touched on this a moment ago, but do you think Designers should have hope? For instance, in a hopeless scenario where the clock, situated in Texas, gets lost because Texas becomes a battleground…have you thought about that? Are you hopeful that it gets found again?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> We designed it to be lost and found for sure, both in the way that it keeps time and has power that it can harvest from the temperature difference. It does more things when people are there, but when they’re not there, it conserves that energy of showing you the time and chiming and things like that. Some of the most successful stories of things lasting a long time are things that are lost, like the Dead Sea Scrolls. If they’re not lost, their chances of surviving sometimes go down. We chose its location based on it being far from human populations, so it is out of the path where humans may destroy and rebuild on a regular basis. We also put it where it’s nowhere near minerals that people would find valuable.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> I hope to visit someday. How has your thinking about time generally changed over the course of your career?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> I’m always kind of looking for a long-term angle on just about anything that I work on and that I think about. In some cases, it’s also discerning what doesn’t need to be thought about long-term and what should be ephemeral. Not everything needs to be long-term. Art and fashion need a lot of space to be ephemeral and playful. On the other hand, organizations like the WHO, which have been around for 40–50 years, have just gone through their first modern global pandemic, but they don’t seem to be well-positioned to provide all the data gathered and lessons learned for another one. They seem highly politicized and defunded. It’s sad, too, that the CDC is getting decimated. We’re in a position for the first time where we can share information instantly and broadly, and redundantly. We have the ability to gather data and collect data even when people are locked down, which didn’t happen during the Black Plague.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Or even the 1918 Flu Pandemic.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Right. Neither situation had the means to understand what was going on globally. Even worse, is that we have European numbers on deaths but little information on African lives lost.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Switching gears a bit, can you talk about AI and its potential to help with long-term thinking?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> The first time I remember it coming up was in a digital preservation conference we had back in ’98. It was actually <a href=""https://www.jaronlanier.com/"">Jaron Lanier</a> who said, “You know what would be a great use for AI is basically little agents that exercise boring data. Everyone’s preserving all the video games because they’re fun, but who’s preserving WordPerfect 2.0 and knowing if it’s not working on a current system?”</p><p>I don’t think that AI is going to be as destructive as many think. I think it’s going to cause a lot of differences, but I’m certainly not a big doomsayer about it.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> If we’re engaged with spectral thinking, AI exists on that spectrum. There will be bad actors who do horribly evil things, there’ll be some really, really cool advancements for humanity and society, and everything in between. It will take some jobs and create other jobs. There will be a shift.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> When people started freaking out about AI taking jobs was exactly when AI could start taking journalist jobs. Automation has been taking jobs for a long time…a dishwashing machine in a restaurant took a dishwasher’s job. Dishwashers are like the first robots, but no one cared because doing dishes was a chore, and dishwashers had no agency. But the day that ChatGPT could write an article better than about 75% of writers, the journalists all freaked out, and then they wrote a bunch of articles. When DALL-E came out, I saw real problems coming for the illustration market.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, I teach over at California College of the Arts, and the Illustration Department in particular is very upset about AI. But it’s just one perspective. When <a href=""https://www.pentagram.com/about/paula-scher"">Paula Scher,</a> a Pentagram Partner, is willing to train an AI with an illustration style to generate hundreds of icons for <a href=""http://performance.gov/"">Performance.gov</a>, I appreciate her efforts to embrace the new tools, although she took a lot of shit for it. I think it’s going to be a bit of a roller coaster ride for a while. <br /> <br /> Listen, thanks very much for your time. I realize how valuable it is.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Happy to speak to you. Thanks.</p><p>After we spoke, I dug up the earliest reference to what would become the Long Now Foundation and the clock in an article by Hillis.</p><figure><img alt=""Image of a photo I took of the Wired Scenarios article from Danny Hillis. The quote that is most completely pictured here is: “I plant my acorns knowing that I will never live to harvest the oak. I have hope for the future.” — Hillis (1995)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5tsO1KCEOtjLUx7XkwLrbQ.png"" /><figcaption>Photo of Wired Scenarios from the library of the California College of Arts taken by Dave Hoffer</figcaption></figure><p>Several things struck me:</p><p><strong>Conception</strong><br /> <br />Hillis talks about conceiving of the clock, and he says,</p><blockquote>“My friends who get it all have ideas that focus on a particular aspect of the clock. My engineering friends worry about the power source: solar, water, nuclear, geothermal, diffusion, or tidal? My entrepreneurial friends muse about how to make it financially self-sustaining. My writer friend, <a href=""http://www.well.com/user/sbb/"">Stewart Brand</a>, starts thinking about the organization that will take care of the clock. It’s a Rorschach test — of time. <a href=""http://www.geffen.com/gabriel.html"">Peter Gabriel</a>, the musician, thinks the clock should be alive, like a garden, counting the seasons with short-lived flowers, counting the years with sequoias and bristlecone pines. Artist <a href=""http://www.spies.com/Eno/Enohome.html"">Brian Eno</a> felt it should have a name, so he gave it one: The Clock of the Long Now.”</blockquote><p>That’s a really good list of people to speak with about an endeavor like this.</p><p><strong>Execution</strong></p><p>Hillis talks about what it means to build such a clock and its longevity. Corrosion and power sources were actually less of a concern to him than people, as the real problem. What if, for instance, it lasted 500 years but was lost? Those who found it cared more about the metal that it was made of and scrapped it for parts.</p><blockquote>“In the universe, pure information lives the longest. Bits last.”</blockquote><p>People’s construct of time has lasted a great deal longer than most clocks. It’s the ideas (bits) that last. Hillis is friends with Teller (of Penn and Teller), who suggested that Hillis film a documentary, establish the idea that the clock exists, but never really build it. Teller’s career was built on misdirection, but it’s an interesting take on longevity. Create the idea, not the actual clock.</p><p><strong>Hope</strong></p><p>What struck me the most was how Hillis ended the article:</p><blockquote>“I cannot imagine the future, but I care about it. I know I am a part of a story that starts long before I can remember and continues long beyond when anyone will remember me. I sense that I am alive at a time of important change, and I feel a responsibility to make sure that the change comes out well. I plant my acorns knowing that I will never live to harvest the oaks. I have hope for the future.”</blockquote><p>I’m with Hillis on this. I planted Redwood trees in my backyard, and I know I’ll never live to see them grow huge, but we have to have hope for the future, despite how bleak things look right now. Earlier in the article, Hillis talks about what the future might hold.</p><blockquote>“The end of everything we know. The beginning of something we may never understand.”</blockquote><p>Certainly, no one foresaw the place we’ve arrived at in this, our future. The English expression (misattributed to an ancient Chinese curse) — May you live in interesting times — seems especially significant. <br /> <br /> And yet, I still have hope for the future. I hope you do too.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p>Tse, P.U., Intriligator, J., Rivest, J. <em>et al.</em> Attention and the subjective expansion of time. <em>Perception &amp; Psychophysics</em> <strong>66</strong>, 1171–1189 (2004). <a href=""https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03196844"">https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03196844</a></p><p>Inner Cosmos with David Eagleman — Does time really slow down when you’re in fear for your life?

<h4>What happens when systems decide the human is ‘all-knowing’</h4><figure><img alt=""Cover design with title, ominous, with illustrative eyes peering through fur"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hefC9NVYPmY91g01Rlsdeg.png"" /></figure><blockquote>Ever click a button and have a system misbehave with no warning, feedback, or a way to undo, only to feel the repercussions minutes or a few days later?</blockquote><p>This is what I’ve coined “Designing for Omniscience” (and the horrors thereof). It’s what happens when a system assumes the human on the other end is ‘all-knowing’ and proceeds in silence. This arrogance of finality can scar (or scare) and have real world consequences beyond the screen, and in some cases, can be catastrophic.</p><p>Many systems are accidentally designed to act with certainty. I’ll unpack the hidden ghosts of imperfection in interfaces we rely heavily on to handle our finances, ensure smooth healthcare transactions, make online purchases, and govern how we secure our homes and travel.</p><h4><strong>Horror #1: Design systems devoid of humanity</strong></h4><p>To be human is to make mistakes. But every product makes a choice: to create space for human error, or silently treat it as intent. What happens when systems act in such a way that the human is blamed for the system’s oversight? Earlier this month, I found myself in this scenario with a healthcare portal.</p><p>It’s common knowledge through our collective experience as patients that some medical software is a patchwork of older systems and code at best. Don’t be surprised if there are cobwebbed corners of COBOL, responsible for critical system functions behind the curtain in municipal and financial software that you rely on.*</p><p>Both healthcare professionals and patients who rely on these tools are forced to use software that feels like a journey to the infancy of the internet. Part of the problem is that the software is optimized for the larger healthcare company at best.</p><p>The problem with optimizing for one persona is twofold:</p><ol><li><strong>The system is developed for the licensee’s benefit. </strong>Designed for data compliance, billing accuracy, and liability management, leaving a gap for the lived experience of patients (not to mention the most vulnerable populations seeking care);</li><li><strong>The system is brittle. </strong>When those least equipped (elderly patients, caregivers, busy parents managing entire family care), must navigate these systems, errors turn into billing nightmares or missed care, creating unnecessary burdens due to a system that assumes the patient is all-knowing.</li></ol><p>For nearly a decade, I used a popular digital payment service for online transactions. Adding a virtual card as one of my payment methods in my healthcare provider’s portal, I wasn’t aware that the system would decline payment despite a funded checking account. There was no alert, warning, or feedback provided. I didn’t need to triple check on a card in the portal before payment, nor did I get a signal that anything could go awry.</p><figure><img alt=""Rough sketch of the software’s Billing and payments page, with no update, read, or delete experience to verify or change payment."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HShv6TOVGz6_5_6yKSTeSg.png"" /><figcaption>Rough sketch of the software’s Billing and payments page, with no update, read, or delete experience to verify or change payment.</figcaption></figure><p>The first time, I assumed a temporary glitch in the portal since I’d never had problems with utilization. A day after the 2nd decline, I received formal communication framing a routine billing issue in alarmingly severe terms. Later, I discovered, the system allows users to upload payment methods that it cannot always reliably process due to privacy and compliance regulations that virtual cards are not held against. The typical user will never have this knowledge.</p><figure><img alt=""Rough sketch of ‘Add card’ interface. Defaulting a new card is unnoticeable and prechecked."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*V6hUMbausOtApDLuXmOt2A.png"" /><figcaption>Rough sketch of ‘Add card’ interface. Defaulting a new card is unnoticeable and prechecked.</figcaption></figure><p>This is a result of “Designing for Omniscience.” The software introduces a lived experience with a horrifying threat for the end user by prioritizing transaction finality and legal defensibility over people and their well being. The most vulnerable populations won’t experience ‘Designing for Omniscience’ as minor bug but as a systemic failure, one with no business incentive to fix. It’s software built on the idea that the intended beneficiary is 100% responsible for an unvalidated click.</p><h4><strong>Horror #2: Granting unearned ‘God mode’</strong></h4><p>Imagine you’re facing the cockpit of a commercial aircraft. These systems are built on a design ethos that assists users in their decision making, and have set up parameters to check human choices given environmental factors. Now, consider for a moment, while activating another control, you accidentally activate the thrust reverser, a device that redirects engine power to slow down on the ground. Sensors confirm when they can be deployed on the ground, but if activated during flight, the system does more than display a warning; <strong>it prevents you from taking the action.</strong> The system design for aeronautics employs situational awareness and anticipates human error to protect everyone on board.</p><p>In 2021 a video-on-demand streaming service sent a blank test email, subject line: “<strong>Integration Test Email #1</strong>” to 6 million subscribers, bypassing the internal test list. The mass mailing was sent by an intern who likely received insufficient system feedback when confirming, with no perceived consequences before clicking “Send.” Ask any Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) about a failsafe, and they’d wax lyrical about the concept of a “Game day.” A simulation environment that enables practicing for disasters and the ability to run various tests in a controlled learning environment before an incident.</p><p>The company’s help team took to a social media platform and apologized for the incident, but called out its intern.</p><figure><img alt=""We mistakenly stend out an empty test email to a portion of our HBO Max mailing list this evening. We apologize for the inconvenience, and as the jokes pile in, yes, it was the intern. No, really.

Most related to posts confirming they too experienced poorly designed hands-off systems, treating the “Send” button as low, if not no friction. In this case, the software assumed the user understood the volume of the distribution list chosen and confidently didn’t need draft mode or a sandbox, following the send command.</p><p>Being able to select a full list of subscribers from a test account is nerve wracking; then to hit send with no fail safe, is a design flaw with rightfully placed anxiety on the user. Here, the system assumed a level of confidence in the intern, who likely hasn’t garnered this level of trust, yet was afforded an unusual amount typically granted a senior or seasoned manager driving a marketing platform.</p><p>Without parameters like role-based access control (RBAC), there’s a projected fallacy of perfect knowledge onto humans by software, giving free rein and superpowers over decisions that can cause a ripple effect of issues.

In 2020, a financial institution intended to make a $7.8M interest payment to its lender. The institution employs a loan operating system to handle its financial transactions. The software was older and inherently complex. The interface mistakenly allowed a wire disbursement to the full principal, shy of $900 million.</p><p>A built in pause: When purchasing my home, before receiving a cashier’s check for an amount that my financial institution saw as unusual for my spending pattern, they paused. Seeing the recipient was an Esq., they assumed it was for a home down payment. The banker asked if it was for a down payment, and gave me a surprising, heartfelt congratulations when I confirmed. This subtle, in person fact checking process was designed with humans and connection in mind to protect the individual and the institution. The banking software missed this layer of contextual awareness, and the opportunity to flag high stakes was missed. This pause can catch errors before they become legal pain.</p><p>The product teams designing <strong>against</strong> omniscience today,</p><ol><li><strong>Create a pattern of verifying </strong>and communicate with context. Affirming: “Are you sure? You’re sending an email to 6M subscribers” or “$900M will be funded toward principal. Is this information correct?” allowing multiple people to check the summary.</li><li><strong>Enforce awareness and constraint.</strong> Building safe systems that warn you and prevent errors before they happen. When enforcing constraints, the system is designed to collect data for improved contextual awareness and pattern recognition over time, circumventing a crisis.</li><li><strong>Allow for good service management.</strong> They know that not every user needs access to ALL commands. Approvals and governance give far more freedom, reinforcing a culture of psychological safety in organizations, big or small.</li></ol><p>Every system’s design pattern carries the weight of necessary decision making, a decision about who carries the burden of cognitive load. It questions, “Will this flow remove the final confirmation for powerful commands?” “Will every weighted command be granted by default?” “Can we give users a choice on which failures to silence?” When designing, diverse teams can choose differently, building systems that balance power, protection, and forgiveness, making the choice for more efficient and safe software. The alternative gears us toward a future in which the very technologies built to serve us, as we quickly make advances, create larger implications if they are designed to continue to see users as omniscient. That’s the greatest horror of all.</p><p>*<em>Source:<br /></em><a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/06/new-jersey-seeks-cobol-programmers-to-fix-unemployment-system.html""><em>NJ needs volunteers who know COBOL</em></a><em>… (2020), + NYDOL<br /></em><a href=""https://www.zdnet.com/article/if-cobol-is-so-problematic-why-does-the-us-government-still-use-it/""><em>If COBOL is so problematic, why does the US gov’t still use it?</em></a><em> (2025)</em></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=557ba3ea60e4"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-horrors-of-designing-for-omniscience-557ba3ea60e4"">The horrors of designing for omniscience</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Karl Popper and the extinction of the rational mind</h4><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white portrait of philosopher Karl Popper in his later years, wearing a light collared shirt under a sweater, looking thoughtfully at the camera against a dark background."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gsKgDFv2JisUig2zOdNqOA.png"" /><figcaption>Karl Popper</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Disagreement feels like a loyalty test.</strong></p><p>Even the way we ask questions has changed. We phrase them like traps and treat the answers as evidence. That hasn’t stopped us from talking about sensitive topics, but it’s made talking things out feel very performative.</p><p>For me, it’s raised a harder question: What does tolerance actually mean? Because those most eager to claim it might be showing us its limits.</p><p><em>I’m </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/natesowder/""><em>Nate Sowder</em></a><em>, and this is unquoted, installment 11. It’s on Karl Popper and why our ability to reason is losing ground.</em></p><h3>The paradox that defined an open society</h3><p>In the 1940s, Karl Popper was watching Europe fracture under ideologies that promised perfection. Fascism on the right… communism on the left. Each claimed moral certainty, each silenced dissent, and both produced the same result: <strong>ruin</strong>.</p><p>He also saw that when societies built on freedom fail, they fail because they forget how to defend that freedom, not because they lack ideals.</p><p>That distinction is important and became known as the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance""><em>Paradox of Tolerance.</em></a></p><p>If a society is endlessly tolerant (even of those who would destroy it) its openness becomes the weapon that ends it. However, if it fights back by becoming intolerant in its defense, it destroys itself from the inside.</p><p>You can see the paradox everywhere.</p><ul><li>Online communities that tolerate every voice until no reasonable ones remain.</li><li>Workplaces where “all ideas are valid” slowly turn into echo chambers.</li><li>Governments that either over-police or under-protect, losing legitimacy both ways.</li></ul><p>This is where constraints become useful. When disagreement has rules that keep learning possible, a system can stabilize. Remove those boundaries, and what’s left isn’t conversation, it’s noise. Really loud noise.</p><h3>Is conviction incentivized?</h3><p>Popper assumed reason would have home-field advantage. That people, given access to enough information and debate, would use both to get smarter.</p><p>He didn’t live to see a world where information moves faster than understanding. Where the desire for attention replaced the desire for credibility, and the platforms built to democratize truth started monetizing conviction instead of reflection.</p><p>The <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/"">open society</a> he imagined depended on friction which included time to debate and learn. As we know too well, the systems we built removed that. Attention has become a metric of truth and if you can move fast enough, well, that’s a pretty good <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/negotiating-truth-ad3ea06886b2"">negotiation tactic</a>.</p><p>That’s when the result starts to feel predictable. Moral confidence will always outperform curiosity, and when belief spreads faster than anyone’s desire to verify it, conviction becomes a competitive advantage.</p><p>That’s a design flaw Popper didn’t anticipate: <strong>We built networks that prize the expression of belief but penalize the act of changing one.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Philosopher Karl Popper sitting outdoors at a table, wearing a short-sleeved white shirt, writing in a notebook with a pen. A cup and small recorder rest nearby, and the background shows a garden with chairs, potted flowers, and sunlight."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9CeKlg-bxFE367WsqH7QjA.png"" /><figcaption>Philosopher Karl Popper</figcaption></figure><h3>The moral armor of tolerance</h3><p>Popper saw tolerance as a civic safeguard. That means a system designed to protect disagreement so reason could do its work. But somewhere along the line, tolerance stopped being a discipline.</p><p>Let’s look at where things are today. The people most likely to describe themselves as <a href=""https://www.freiheit.org/mexico/limits-tolerance-poppers-paradox"">“tolerant”</a> often carry the firmest moral boundaries. Their openness ends right where their convictions begin. They don’t enter conversations to be open or change. Instead, they enter to show that they don’t need to be.</p><p>You can hear it in how people with conviction build their case. They take a broad topic and zoom in until only a small part is emphasized. That part becomes the whole argument, which to them, feels very clear. That’s why conviction feels like clarity. It’s not a wide view, it’s actually very narrow.</p><p>This is how those exchanges feel when they unfold.</p><ul><li>Questions feel phrased like traps.</li><li>Answers are scored like confessionals.</li><li>Statement are weighed for moral correctness before they’re considered for meaning.</li><li>There is little desire to ‘abstract’ or take a broader view of a topic.</li></ul><p>That’s how tolerance turns into ‘armor’. It wears the language of inclusion but moves like a defense strategy. It’s not there to protect dialogue (or friendship… or relationships) it’s there to protect the person’s identity.</p><p>True openness means arriving without a verdict. If your moral identity enters the room first, your curiosity never makes it through the da*n door.</p><h3>The consequence</h3><p>Conviction is exhausting. It‘s angry.</p><p>I get it. People are passionate, they’re frustrated and feel unheard. And they’re right… a lot of people don’t want to talk to them any more.</p><p>But look, I usually don’t disagree with what’s being said, so it’s not because they’re wrong, it’s because every conversation is abrasive.</p><p>That’s what conviction does. It makes conversation feel like a sentencing.</p><p>Rational people disappear because that’s something they don’t want to deal with. To them, it’s about progress, not persuasion… and that’s a distinction that never seems to register.</p><p>They’re watching the same movie… they just notice different things. For them, it’s more about trying to understand how the scene fits into the plot.</p><p>Reasoning is endurance. They‘re happy to be in the room… they just don’t need to win it.</p><h3>My reflection</h3><p>We can each decide what kind of openness we want to practice… the decorative kind that performs virtue while closing their ears (la-la-la), or the difficult kind that listens without any sort of defense.</p><p>I’ve enjoyed reading about Popper. His stuff was meant to keep societies <em>thinkable, </em>which applies to every system we build.</p><p>The biggest lesson? Reason isn’t polite — but it’s generous.</p><p>If reason feels endangered, it’s because too many of us confuse certainty with strength… and mistake agreement for some sort of progress.</p><p>An open society (and an open mind) only survive the same way: by staying corrigible (Which means being open to being corrected).</p><p>That’s not a weakness.<br />That’s design, baby.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=518c42ec62be"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-paradox-of-tolerance-518c42ec62be"">The paradox of tolerance</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>How the new Sora app icon gives away more than meets the eye.</h4><figure><img alt=""Sora App Icon: A Visual Breakdown"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*h_U-o0S_igR0xLB9nQxcBg.png"" /><figcaption>The New Sora App Icon is Giving Away More Than Meets the Eye.</figcaption></figure><p>Two weeks ago we saw <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/news/797752/openai-sora-app-1-million-downloads"">the release of the new Sora app by OpenAI</a>. Unfortunately the app is only available in the US and Canada, and I’m in neither. Since I can’t use the app itself, I thought I’ll do a breakdown of what I can actually see — the app icon, it looks simple at first glance but it packs a lot if we can deconstruct it. I’m doing this breakdown as a fun exercise in design appreciation, I know my breakdown will probably not going to align with the authorial intent behind it. If you like this breakdown please share it, now let’s dive in.</p><p>These kinds of breakdowns are akin to exercises I used to do while earning my Master’s Degree in Visual Communications, they can be a lot of fun but they’re intended to reveal hidden truths or meanings lurking in plain sight. Seeing with our eyes is great but analyzing a visual component in a written long-form article tend to make us (or at least — make me) think a little harder, to notice the things I can feel when looking at a visual work, but don’t consciously see.</p><p>Breaking down Sora’s app icon will require some knowledge of what the Sora app is. Sora is a mix of a social video app, like TikTok, but all the content is AI generated videos, not unlike Midjourney’s Explore page.</p><p>The Sora app also has a feature called “cameo” where you can generate videos of yourself, or any other person who gave the app permission, could be your friends or could be celebrities like Michael Jackson or even OpenAI’s Sam Altman (who appears in many of Sora’s videos).</p><p>The generated videos are not more than 10 seconds long and rendered with both sound and a moving watermark, to make it harder to spread as real footage. The app itself is invite only right now, but will probably be available soon to everyone, with better and more precise rules and guardrails in place. Even though the app feels like TikTok and got a lot of comparisons to TikTok in both the traditional media and social media — its app icon is very different.</p><figure><img alt=""OpenAI Sora new website, screenshot shows 4 AI Generated videos."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xMhzoToX8aixuIrFPpGpzw.png"" /><figcaption><em>OpenAI’s Sora website — on the right side are 4 generated videos.</em></figcaption></figure><h3>The little cloud</h3><p>The most prominent element in the Sora icon is without a doubt the cloud in the middle. At first we can see by its shape and angle of rotation that this cloud is the same as the ChatGPT icon — OpenAI’s only app except Sora.</p><figure><img alt=""Sora’s app icon, ChatGPT app icon and both overlayed on one another."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sZUSB5cki_xyNyb23vFeHA.png"" /><figcaption><em>Left to right: Sora app icon, ChatGPT app icon, both icons overlayed.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The reason I started by calling it a “cloud” is that it looks kind of like a cloud since it’s floating in the sky. This also can fit the AI narrative of making everything, including videos, in the cloud (in the technological sense of clouds). Generated AI images are also often compared to humans looking at the clouds and seeing things, and in that sense it would be really easy to see a cloud in this icon too. But when I tried to compare it to other clouds iconography used by tech companies, something amazing happened- I realized it’s not a cloud at all.</p><figure><img alt=""Sora app icon, Apple’s iCloud app icon and Microsoft’s OneDrive App icon"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PpcopKEAVo8yQaO0bvpmeg.png"" /><figcaption><em>Sora app icon, Apple’s iCloud app icon and Microsoft’s OneDrive App icon</em></figcaption></figure><p>Notice how the other “clouds” are flat at the bottom so the cloud can actually stand upright when left alone on a desk, like a computer would. This might be an intentional aspect of cloud computing since they are computers behind the curtains, after all.</p><p>The Sora icon is different, so it’s not a cloud, it can also reference a thought bubble in the style of comics, since they have no flat part. Notice that these bubbles are for thinking, not speaking.</p><p>The thinking behind this might be that Sora generates videos in the speed of thought, any video you can think of will be done in mere minutes. The only barrier now is your own imagination, or your thought process, just like the thought bubbles in comics that can only hold so much text. Also, both comics and AI prompts use text in a very similar ”conversational” manner, so it’s only natural to use it for this icon.</p><figure><img alt=""Left: Sora app icon, Right: a thought bubble (from Understanding Comics/ Scott McCloud, 1993)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_DErPy0iu-bjGI7V1kODdw.png"" /><figcaption><em>Left: Sora app icon, Right: a thought bubble (from Understanding Comics/ Scott McCloud, 1993)</em></figcaption></figure><p>At this point you might think sure I believe you it’s a thought bubble, but why does this bubble have eyes, well I’m getting to it.</p><h3>Smiling with your eyes</h3><p>First of all let’s get the obvious out of the way — the eyes make it seem like a friendly robot, signaling this AI is a friendly one. Sora’s AI is a cute little robot that just wants to help you be more creative and is capable of no harm (roll your eyes now, please).</p><p>Of course, that’s not the whole story, the eyes have little AI “sparkling” emoji, as we all know this emoji (✨) was intended to signal magical stuff but was hijacked by the AI industry to signal if anything has AI in it. Much like the AI industry highjacked all of our content and scrapped everything humans ever created- they also highjacked the icon to represent it (again, roll your eyes).</p><figure><img alt=""Sora’s app icon next to an anime girl with sparkling eyes."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FGJHCLSs7F2EYhoVhcAUMA.png"" /><figcaption><em>Left: Sora app icon, Right: Smile Precure!, スマイルプリキュア！ (Episode 35)</em></figcaption></figure><p>This emoji, like all original emojis, was first made by Shigetaka Kurita for SoftBank- a Japanese telecom company. Kurita itself was asked by David Amel (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pG79LOtMw""><em>YouTube link</em></a>) about the usage of this icon for AI features and he didn’t like it. Of course anybody can use any emoji but since its meaning was originally supposed to be something else and the literal father of emojis doesn’t like it, I’ll consider this emoji stolen because they highjacked its meaning.</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot from David Amel’s video showing him talking and two sparkling amojis signifying either magical things or AI."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ADT0DP5Uz6zR6_7Le47u4w.avif"" /><figcaption>David Amel Emoji video (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pG79LOtMw"">YouTube Link</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>To bring it back to the Sora icon itself, if we’ll look closely at the eyes we can see that it’s not eyes at all, it’s holes that we can see the background through. What can be the meaning of those “holes for eyes” face, well — first of all let’s explore the most simple answer. A face with holes for eyes is a skull, the eyes decay and we’re left with only the bones.</p><figure><img alt=""Sora’s app icon next to an Emoji skull."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*52WES-3a-DkiTiXOWW9kUQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Sora app icon vs a skull (via Apple’s Emoji)</em></figcaption></figure><p>A skull is obviously a dead person, but it can also refer to pirates because of their flag, known as the Jolly Roger or simply as the “skull and crossbones”. Pirates can mean a few things in the software business, first and the most likely explanation here is a nod to the famous Steve Jobs quote “it’s better to be a pirate than to join the navy”.</p><p>The meaning of this quote is that it’s better to explore the unexplored than to act inline — since the discovery of the new will always happen by “pirates”. Steve Jobs apparently felt so strongly about this quote that he did decorate Apple’s offices with the Jolly Roger flag in his first run at Apple.</p><figure><img alt=""Young Steve Jobs and John Sculley standing in frond of an Apple-made Jolly Roger pirate flag."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*3aD_OJbftxwqTxSoODN3TA.avif"" /><figcaption><em>Steve Jobs standing in front of Apple’s Jolly Roger flag.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Of course we’re all thinking about the other explanation of a pirate flag in the software industry and that’s pirated software. Pirated software is what the software industry calls a piece of software that users share among themselves without proper licensing.</p><p>That was (and still is) a crime when people did that and some people even got sued or fined for it. But when big companies do that, like OpenAI and other AI companies it’s somehow not a crime and they get to be worth billions of dollars instead. So they do really get to be pirates.</p><p>Another popular entity with holes for eyes is the Golem. The Golem is a famous European Jewish myth about a clay creature that becomes alive when a wise rabbi does some magic to awake him. The magic this rabbi is doing is to carve a word into the Golem’s forehead, the word in this instance can be analogous to a prompt the AI needs to do its magic, to become “alive”.</p><p>Both AI and the Golem in the story are not really alive but rather have the illusion of being alive. The Jewish tale is meant to be cautionary, the Golem is becoming unstoppable and tries to upstage the rabbi, much like AI is threatening to upstage human workers in many different industries today.</p><p>If you don’t like this Jewish parable you can think of The Terminator instead, it’s also a man-made entity that, once built, we lost any control over it. The Terminator again looks like a skull and again has no eyes (only lights, much like the sparkling in Sora’s no-eyes), so it’s a good enough reference, although I prefer the Golem analogy. The Terminator is also regarded as a cautionary tale against the dangers of AI, of course.</p><figure><img alt=""Sora’s app icon next to a statue of the Golem."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g_t9O3KNj1dY8W9Y0atZlA.png"" /><figcaption><em>Sora app icon vs The Golem (statue in Prague, Czech Republic)</em></figcaption></figure><h3>Stars at night</h3><p>Sora’s icon is also interesting, it is a linear gradient transitioning from blue up to a very dark blue, it’s brighter at the bottom and darker at the top, it also have tiny lighter pixels on it, presumably like stars in the sky.</p><p>OpenAI, I think, picked a blue background for a few reasons, first and foremost it’s reminiscent of other “social” apps, much like Facebook, LinkedIn and the original Twitter app. The transitioning to the darker color is meant to signal that it’s a more modern social app like TikTok, Threads and X (new Twitter) which all share a black background.</p><p>The Sora app isn’t just a video generation AI model, it’s a social app designed to feel much like TikTok and in that sense, they were spot on with the background colors, they signal they’re a new kind of social app but with some respect, or a nod, to the past that started it all.</p><figure><img alt=""First row: Sora, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter.

<h4>What impact does digitization of electoral process actually have?</h4><figure><img alt=""Image of a hand dropping a ballot inside of a computer"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fALUsm56qBpcYPmPfWG2fQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image of a hand dropping a ballot inside of a computer</figcaption></figure><p>The mayoral election is around the corner in my hometown of Montreal, so I wanted to confirm whether I was registered to vote at my current address. What I naively assumed would be a simple task turned out to require a trip to a local community centre. I gave my name, they flipped through a binder, and gave me the thumbs up within 3 seconds of arriving. It felt like the ultimate “this could have been an email” moment and I lost two hours of my day confirming something I should’ve been able to check online in those 3 seconds.</p><p>Technology isn’t a silver bullet, and I’m far from a techno-optimist, but it <em>can </em>be a powerful vector for improvement. When designed carefully, it can increase accessibility, surface critical information, maybe even make it easier for people to engage civically in this context. For a long time, I assumed the main reason we hadn’t digitized more of the democratic process was good old-fashioned bureaucracy, a sluggish, underfunded government with outdated tools. I held a fundamental belief that if we simply made it easier to vote by letting people cast ballots from their phones or laptops more people <em>would</em>! More access = more engagement.</p><p>So I decided to investigate some interesting examples of places where they’ve managed to digitize their electoral process and see what the results were!</p><figure><img alt=""Markhamian looking at an digital ballot on an iPad"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*Pnh_PCN3gDlRGcYk"" /><figcaption>Markhamian looking at an digital ballot on an iPad</figcaption></figure><h3>Markham’s digital experiment</h3><p>We’ll start with an interesting homegrown example. <a href=""https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&amp;dir=rec/tech/consult&amp;document=p5&amp;lang=e"">In 2003, the City of Markham,</a> a suburb north of Toronto, launched one of Canada’s first pilot projects to enable online voting in a municipal election. The initiative was small at first but had the ambitious aim of testing whether residents could safely and securely cast a ballot from their home computers!</p><p>As is often the case with public sector innovation, the city didn’t have the money or in-house expertise to develop its own secure digital voting infrastructure so it turned to a third-party vendor called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scytl"">Scytl</a>, a Spanish company that specialized in using cryptography to secure elections. The way the system works is each eligible voter receives a Voter Information Letter by mail, this includes a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN). Then during the advance voting period, Markhamians? Markhamites? People from Markham would go to Markham’s election website, hosted by Scytl, enter their PIN, and authenticate their identity with personal information (such as date of birth and postal code) matched against the city’s registry. Once verified, they could cast their vote through a digital ballot interface! And voila, the vote was then encrypted and transmitted to a secure election server, where it remained sealed until game day(election day).</p><p>Seems straight-forward enough right? And, cherry on top, according to city officials, online voting participation increased in each cycle, particularly among seniors and people with mobility limitations! But here’s the kicker: despite the relatively simple process, turnout didn’t budge. Most of the people who voted online were the same people who would’ve voted anyway.</p><p>Unfortunately, Markham’s experiment became a reference point across Canada informing other municipalities’ approaches to digital voting. Also more importantly, the third party system that Markham was relying on, Scytl, eventually filed for <a href=""https://www.lavanguardia.com/economia/20200514/481138885893/scytl-sandton-capital-liquidacion-venta-negocio-juez-voto-electronico.html"">bankruptcy in 2020, citing over €75 million</a> in debt. Causing us to ask the question: what happens when the company holding your digital ballots no longer exists? Without money to invest in an internal system and having to rely on third parties, can be potentially devastating. What if Scytl had gone bankrupt, during an election? Needless to say, Markham no longer allows e-voting, which makes me e-sad.</p><figure><img alt=""ivote interface showing how votes could be stolen"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*I7c20DI7UwdOvEO3.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/1504.05646"">A proof of concept, that shows the exploit against iVote to inject malicious code that would surreptitiously manipulate the voter’s choices</a></figcaption></figure><h3>When e-voting went wrong</h3><p>While Markham was a valiant attempt, it was small potatoes dealing with local politics and might not in and of itself be representative of the potential impact of online voting at a national level. So let’s look at an example of how things can go, very, very wrong and very right. Starting with the bad.</p><p>In 2015, New South Wales Australia rolled out the <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05646?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">world largest ever e-vote</a> system called iVote. This system allowed voters to cast their ballots online during the state election. Again the goal was to increase accessibility for people with disabilities and those living remotely, while also trying to modernize the voting experience by letting people vote from personal devices.</p><p>iVote purportedly was actually quite a nice app and the user experience was smooth and intuitive. Public communication about this new way of voting was also strong, causing nearly 280,000 votes to be cast using iVote in that election! Trouble is, in the days following the election, some pesky independent researchers discovered <a href=""https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-22270-7_3""><strong>severe vulnerabilities</strong></a> in the live system. Among them: an insecure external analytics script that could have allowed attackers to intercept or alter votes, and a verification process that could be manipulated to provide false assurances to voters.</p><p>What’s worse, there is no clear evidence of tampering, but the possibility was there and because of this they will never try to pilot a program like this again. This may have very well affected who took office and the downstream impacts of that are no joke. The point of this example is to highlight what is at stake if the system goes south, or should I say New South (I’m sorry). In this case, there was no clear evidence of hacking but the vulnerability existed and may have been exploited to favour one candidate or another. With consequences this high, how important is the convenience of voting online in contrast?</p><p><a href=""https://www.innovationaus.com/ivote-written-out-of-nsw-law-as-digital-voting-review-begins/"">iVote was quietly shelved</a> in the years that followed. They had lost the trust of the public despite a lack of evidence of hacking and what began as a promise of a modern democracy ended up as a prime example of how important security is in this conversation. The lesson from New South Wales is clear: building digital voting systems isn’t just about making them easy to use, it’s about making them impossible to doubt. And that requires more than good design. It requires deep, structural transparency, independent oversight, and a willingness to stop and re-assess when trust begins to weaken.</p><figure><img alt=""Image showing Estonia’s digital ID card"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Wds6woYpODxmW6Pv.jpg"" /><figcaption>Example of Estonias Digital ID card</figcaption></figure><h3>The shining beacon of Estonia</h3><p>Lastly, I’d like to pull up the most frequently cited example of a successful techo-democracy. Estonia! A small but mighty nation that is often on the cutting edge. They were the first country to launch internet voting at a national level in <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4343374.stm"">2005</a>. Their system called i-voting, allowed citizens to cast their ballots online from any internet connected device, for both national and municipal elections. When it initially rolled out, online adoption was around <a href=""https://www.valimised.ee/en/archive/statistics-about-internet-voting-estonia"">2%</a> in the first year but it has since climbed to over <a href=""https://www.valimised.ee/en/archive/statistics-about-internet-voting-estonia"">40%</a> of its population using online voting.</p><p>But, the reason this is possible is because unlike most countries, Estonia had spent the prior decade building a national digital identity card. This is a critical part of the puzzle unfortunately, and it’s what allows their digital voting program to be so successful. They already use their digital ID’s to file taxes, access their own medical records, and sign legal documents. So when the opportunity came to use this same, state-backed secure authentication method, it was a no brainer. They had the full infrastructure to roll it out.</p><p>Their i-Voting process is built for security and usability. Voters insert their <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_identity_card"">digital ID card</a> (or they can use a mobile app), log into a government portal, and are presented with a digital ballot. Once completed, their vote is encrypted and then sent to a secure server. To guard against coercion or vote buying, voters can re-vote multiple times online. This protects against a common concern people have in e-voting, which is buying votes! Only their final submission is counted. And if someone chooses to vote in person on election day, it overrides any previous digital votes. Pretty ingenious.</p><p>Crucially, Estonia’s system includes end-to-end cryptographic verification. Voters can use a smartphone app to verify that their encrypted ballot was received and counted as intended without revealing who they voted for. The entire system is publicly audited, with detailed post-election reviews conducted by independent experts.</p><p>The Estonian system really is as good as it gets when it comes to a thoughtful, comprehensive and secure approach to digitizing democracy, and because of its long history it also offers us some concrete data on what effect digitization has on voter turnout. So here it is: 0.2 to 0.8 percentage points. That’s it. From 2005 to 2025. The painful truth is that if you’re looking to get more empowered citizens, focusing on access to voting is actually the last step in the process.</p><p>There are tangibly good reasons to invest in e-voting and they genuinely matter. From an accessibility standpoint alone, giving people with reduced mobility the ability to vote independently and securely is a powerful step forward. That, in itself, is worth the effort.</p><p>But if the goal is to dramatically increase engagement, we’re nowhere near a solution and I’m confident that the solution won’t be a purely technological one. What I uncovered is, if you care about people voting, it’s clear that access, especially technological access, is not the main bottleneck.</p><p>We need to stop obsessing over the ballot interfaces and start asking harder questions. Why don’t people vote in the first place? What would make them want to?</p><p>That’s where the real design challenge lies and that’s where we should be putting our energy!</p><p>P.S Don’t forget to vote in your next election</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=cfd6674465a2"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/can-technology-fix-voting-cfd6674465a2"">Can technology fix voting?</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h2>14K Gold Hoop Earrings</h2>

<p>The perfect blend of luxury and wearability, true 14k gold hoops are an investment that deliver timeless sophistication. Whether you choose Mejuri’s sleek pair, Kinn’s lightweight everyday option, or Angara’s square hoop shape, these are your forever earrings — versatile for coffee runs <em>and</em> soirées alike.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Huggies &amp; Small Gold Hoop Earrings</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940585.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Small gold hoops may be subtle, but these pint-sized pieces bring just the right touch of shine to any look. Huggies also, well, hug your lobes just right, offering maximum comfort while still offering a polished touch to your outfit. Given their <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-petite-workwear-ann-taylor"">petite size</a>, you can easily stack them to climb your ear or wear them solo. From twisted tubes to diamond accents, there’s a huggie for every sartorial vibe. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>White Gold Hoop Earrings</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940586.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>If all the viral <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/teddy-blonde-hair-color-trend"">color analysis videos</a> have convinced you that you’re more of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/silver-nails-manicure-trend-ideas"">silver gal</a> (but you still want the luxe durability that gold provides), white gold is the cool-toned twist you need to own. Best of all, brands have designed just as many options in white gold as they have in the metal’s yellow-gold counterpart, including classic small and large hoops, as well as textured and bubbled designs.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Chunky Gold Hoop Earrings</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940587.png?width=960&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=15%3A16"" /></figure>



<p>Thick gold hoops balance boldness with timeless appeal. Some retain a sleek and sculptural feel, while others lean into a chunky and puffy silhouette. Either way, they effortlessly elevate everything from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/copenhagen-fashion-week-fall-winter-2025-street-style"">minimalist outfits</a> to<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cardigan-sweaters""> cozy cardigans</a>. And sure, bigger can certainly be better, but that doesn’t always mean more expensive — these styles all come in under $150.</p>

<h2>Large Gold Hoop Earrings </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940588.png?width=818&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=409%3A512"" /></figure>



<p>Make a statement with a pair of go-to large gold hoops. How big you go in circumference is up to you, of course. An oversized pair made from a single thin wire is a classic, while others feature sculptural details begging for a double-take. Continuous circles and open-ended backs both bring just the right amount of drama to everything from a black turtleneck to a tailored blazer — and require little other jewelry. </p>

<p>For a good chunk of the late ‘90s and 2000s, it would be rare to see twins Tia and Tamera Mowry without each other. For many Black millennial women like me who grew up with  <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/06/157426/sister-sister-reboot-tia-tamara-mowry""><em>Sister, Sister</em></a><em> </em>and <a href=""https://www.disneyplus.com/browse/entity-3aa9e7b5-c02e-45db-a8dc-88e9e3a04a11""><em>Twitches</em></a>, Tia and Tamera embodied what we’re talking about when we say “representation matters”: on<em> Sister, Sister</em> they were whole characters who got to be serious or silly, logical or impulsive, boy-crazy or booksmart. And they gave us the freedom to be all of the above too — well, depending on whether you were a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2020/11/10172757/where-to-watch-sister-sister-netflix-canada"">Tia or Tamera</a> (my good grades, shyness, and constant need for parental approval made me a Tia of course). <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/10/10111555/twitches-halloween-movie-underrated"">And with </a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/10/10111555/twitches-halloween-movie-underrated"">Twitches</a></em> (and <em>Twitches Too</em>), they redefined spooky season. Something that didn’t always <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2021/10/10731680/growing-up-black-without-halloween"">feel like it was for us</a> was suddenly anchored by a movie starring two Black girls, and 20 years later, it’s still a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-horror-films-movies-shows"">Halloween staple. </a></p>



<p>Now, the Tia and Tamera sightings are fewer and farther between. So much so that last year when Tia mentioned on her docuseries <em>Tia Mowry: My Next Act</em> that she wished the two were “still close” the internet was convinced the twins had fallen out. Later, <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/tia-tamera-mowry-relationship-now-rcna172091"">Tia Mowry clarified</a> that she and Tamera (now Mowry-Housley after marrying Adam Housley) are better than good and still as close as ever, they just live apart and are busy with their respective professions (both have maintained successful acting careers for the past two decades) and families, naturally. And yet, when the duo reunited recently in <a href=""https://people.com/tia-mowry-tamera-mowry-housley-love-reuniting-focusing-on-what-really-matters-during-holidays-exclusive-11838188"">partnership with HomeGoods</a> for <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DQR_KO2Aa2I/?hl=en"">Deck the Everything Day</a>, the fact that they were in the same place at the same time prompted social media users to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQap_IKkZJ4/?igsh=N2ZleXBqdmsxc2Y0"">lose their minds</a>. </p>



<p>When Tia and Tamera logged on — together — for our Zoom interview, I wish I could say I kept my chill. I didn’t. The nostalgia was too strong. I reverted right back to the kid who worshiped at the altar of <em>Sister, Sister </em>reruns every day after school and who made her entire identity for multiple Halloweens doing the <em><a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@todayshow/video/7159649084423294250?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Twitches</a></em><a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@todayshow/video/7159649084423294250?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> chant</a>. Tis the season to relive our obsession with Tia and Tamera so it’s only fitting that the duo are back together for the holidays for <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/homegoods-kicks-off-third-annual-deck-the-everything-day-with-early-store-openings-inviting-shoppers-to-shop-early-and-unleash-their-holiday-alter-egos-302597797.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">HomeGoods annual </a><em><a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/homegoods-kicks-off-third-annual-deck-the-everything-day-with-early-store-openings-inviting-shoppers-to-shop-early-and-unleash-their-holiday-alter-egos-302597797.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Deck the Everything Day</a>, </em>a holiday created for those early decorators who can’t wait to kick off the holiday season<em>. </em>It was surreal to see their distinct personalities on full display as they chatted about their dueling holiday alter egos, whose mac and cheese is better, and which Mowry sibling is hosting Thanksgiving this year. Here, we get into all of the above — plus, Tia and Tamera talk about what <em>Twitches</em> means to them all these years later and what <em>they</em> mean to Black women. </p>



<p><strong>I’m getting emotional just seeing you two together! Everyone is always so happy to see you both in the same place. Do you feel that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia Mowry: </strong>Yesterday, every five minutes we were getting stopped. And the word that everybody was saying was “nostalgia.” They were so happy to see both of us together. They would see [Tamera] and then when they would see me, they were like, “Oh my god! Hey!” They just lit up when they would see both of us. So basically, what you just did was happening all day yesterday. It was very, very sweet.</p>

<p><strong>You mean so much to me! Do you understand how much you mean to millennial women, especially Black women? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>Thank you. Yesterday, a girl asked for a photo with us and she said the same thing. So I am honoured. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera Mowry-Housley: </strong>We are honoured. It’s so sweet. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>I think [we do understand] now. I think when we were younger, we never really did — </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>That’s interesting. I did in the sense of our natural hair. So many young and up and coming actors now, they would say,<em> thank you so much for representation. You let me know that someone like me can do this, but not only that, someone with my hair. </em>Because, as you know, in the last decade, our natural hair wasn’t always accepted, especially on television and in the workforce. So when they saw us, they’re like,<em> oh my gosh, yes, I can wear my natural hair.</em> It’s beautiful.</p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>Yeah, I think, now, and especially in our late — </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>Gosh, don’t say it. </p>



<p><strong>Tia:</strong> In our late 40s! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>You look good, girl! </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>Thank you, you too!<em> [laughs]</em> Now, in our <em>late 40s</em>, I’m truly understanding the impact of representation and how important it is to see women that look like you be celebrated, and I feel that it leans into the quote, “if you see it, you be it.” And so I think that’s why I followed [your statement] with, “I am honored,” because it’s not easy. Being in the positions that we are in, it’s a constant battle. It’s a constant fight, just being a woman in general.</p>

<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>I can speak for Hallmark. When I started at Hallmark — it’s been about seven years —  I remember not seeing women like me at all on that network, and I got to give it to Michelle Vicary, who is there now, she gave me my chance. She was like, “listen, we want you to tell your stories. I’m going to give you three films to produce.” And I was like, <em>Oh my gosh, the pressure!</em> But also, like Tia was saying, I felt very honored. I did a movie called <em>Girlfriendship</em>, an all-Black woman cast <em>on Hallmark</em> and literally, the producers came back and said, “we’ve had the most black audience we’ve ever had on Hallmark, thank you.” That felt beautiful and amazing. And I’m happy that I’m still there. I still get to tell all kinds of stories of what Black families look like. We’re biracial, I get to tell those stories. And to be honest, the response as the new person, the trailblazer going in there, telling these stories, it wasn’t always positive. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>Yeah, and that’s why I said there’s still a challenge. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>But we’re doing it! </p>



<p><strong>You’re partnering with HomeGoods. Tell me more about that collaboration.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>Let me tell you this, one thing about HomeHoods that I love is there’s representation. So when you see the Santas, you see some Black Santas. It’s amazing. You’ll see some Black nutcrackers. When I saw them I was like, <em>let’s go! </em></p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>Tia always says she loves for people to feel seen, feel heard, and understood. And what’s so cool is that this campaign focuses on the holiday alter ego that comes out</p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>And doing the holidays your way! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>There’s so many different styles. There’s so many different styles, so many different HomeGoods holiday carols that you can choose from that you feel like represents your festive alter ego. </p>



<p><strong>What’s the difference between your holiday alter egos? Who’s the early decorator? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia and Tamera (in unison): </strong>We’re both early decorators! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>For our Thanksgiving dinner that I hosted for our family, it was Christmas. There was Christmas everywhere, but Tia’s more whimsical, winter whimsy. </p>



<p><strong>Tia:</strong> Sparkle, sparkle, baby! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>Yes, glam! I am an ever green icon. So the traditional Christmas colors that you think of — red, green, that cozy, warm, traditional woodsy vibe. But what’s cool is I have blue ornaments, I’ll embody the golden glam Holiday Carol alter ego and I’ll add some gold in there. I love interior design, I love decorating, I love hosting. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>I don’t think a day goes by during the Halloween season when a stranger that we don’t know goes, “Oh my gosh, I love <em>Twitches</em>.”</p><cite>tia mowry on the 20-year anniversary of ‘twitches’</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>Tia:</strong> And hosting on a budget, okay? And that’s what’s so amazing about HomeGoods. I’m telling you, when you look at the prices, you’re like <em>what!? </em>I literally saw a huge Nutcracker. And I love Nutcrackers. We grew up with Nutcrackers. Our mom loves pecans and walnuts, and she would always bring out that Nutcracker. But there was a huge Nutcracker, maybe four, five feet tall, and it was 100 dollars! </p>



<p><strong>We’re talking about holidays so I would love to know your favorite holiday memory together. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia and Tamera (in unison): </strong>Oooh! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>I have a memory, and it was together, I just don’t know if you remember it<em> [laughs]. </em>My memory sometimes is her memory. I’ll say “I remember…” and Tia will be like — </p>



<p><strong>Tia and Tamera (in unison): </strong>“No, that was me!” </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>Tia, do you remember <em>Polar Express,</em> this book, about if you have hope and you believe in magic, you can hear a bell. So we would always read that book to our brother, Tahj, and still to this day, he loves that book. I’ve passed down reading that book to my kids, but there was a moment where I could have sworn we were eight years old and I heard Santa’s footsteps, and I heard the bells. Do you remember that, Tia? </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940561.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p><strong>Tia:</strong> Yes, I do! We really thought it was really Santa because we heard the bells from the reindeer, but it was Dad. We ended up realizing later it was Dad. Our parents did such a great job. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>We believed [in Santa] until we were 11 years old. Yeah, we believed for a long time! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera, you said you hosted Thanksgiving. Are you hosting this year? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>No, we oscillate.<strong> </strong>I always host Christmas but on Thanksgiving we oscillate. It was you last year, me the year before that, so now Tahj is hosting this year. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>We’re going over to his house and we’re all going to be there. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>We do potluck style with Tahj.</p>



<p><strong>Who brings the mac and cheese?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>I do. I can throw down on some mac and cheese. And you know who’s really  good at mac and cheese now?</p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>[our other brother] Tavior. [My husband] Adam’s good too!</p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>But girl he can’t touch my mac and cheese, I’m sorry. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>You know what we should do? We should have the family vote. We need to have a mac and cheese competition between Adam’s, Tavior’s and yours. So you know if you won hands down. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>I’ve tasted Adam’s mac and cheese, girl, and it’s fabulous. It’s great too. But he can’t beat my mac and cheese. Sorry<em> [laughs].</em></p>



<p><strong>We know that you’re both moms, and during the holidays you’re hanging out with each other’s families. Who would your kids say is the fun Auntie between the two of you? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia:</strong> I’m gonna say me. I am so the fun Auntie! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera:</strong> But what would they say about me? </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>I would say that they think that you’re really sweet. And warm and cool. </p>



<p><em>[Editor’s note: Tamera’s phone rings and it’s her husband Adam] </em></p>



<p><strong>Tia:</strong> That’s Adam. Tell him my mac and cheese is better!<em> [laughs]</em></p>



<p><strong>Tamera</strong><strong><em> [on the phone]:</em></strong><strong> </strong>Adam, we’re doing an interview right now. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>Lord have mercy on my soul! My mac and cheese is better than your mac and cheese, Adam! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>What do you say, Adam?</p>



<p><strong><em>[Adam through the phone]</em></strong>: I’m not getting in the middle of this one! </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>SMART man! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera:</strong> I love you, I’ll call you later. <em>[hangs up phone] </em></p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940564.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=762&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A381"" /></figure>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>So I’m the one that’s like, let’s come over to the house and have sleepovers, and let’s jump in the pool, and let’s go to amusement parks and stuff like that. Not that you’re not, but [Tamera], you’re very warm. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera</strong>: If they want to talk about something, or if they’re having a challenging time and just want to release and chill. We’ll watch movies and just relax.</p>



<p><strong>It’s spooky season so everyone is doing their <em>Twitches</em></strong><strong> re-watch. Did you know when you were doing Twitches that all these years later people would still be so obsessed with it?  Does it still blow your mind? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>It blows my mind that people have tatted themselves with the sun and the moon. I’ve seen tattoos! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera:</strong> They have Halloween parties, like the Halloween parties are themed around <em>Twitches</em>. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>I don’t think a day goes by during the Halloween season when a stranger that we don’t know goes, “Oh my gosh, I love <em>Twitches</em>.”</p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>Tia and I loved <em>Halloweentown. </em>Remember, we were obsessed with <em>Halloweentown, </em>and we had no idea that <em>Twitches</em> was going to become one of those. It is insane. Like, it’s iconic. It’s <em>Sister, Sister </em>and <em>Twitches</em>. That’s what we hear the most. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>People actually don’t know that we improvised the [“Go Twitches, go Twitches” chant]. I forgot what the director said but he was just saying, like, have fun. I think in the script it just said “Twitches” or “Twin witches” or something like that. And then we were like — </p>



<p><strong>Tia and Tamera (in unison): </strong>“Go Twitches, go Twitches!” [<em>laughs</em>]</p>



<p><strong>Tamera:</strong> It’s like “go home, Roger!” </p>



<p><strong>That’s our time but I was just going to ask you both to turn to each other and give each other the proverbial flowers that we collectively give to you all the time.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia and Tamera (in unison): </strong>Aww! </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>We really, really appreciate that. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>You know, we should really do that today, give each other [actual] flowers. I’m serious! </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>No, I know. Let’s go get some flowers. </p>

<p>November starts off like a smoldering poem written in invisible ink, and ends like an action-packed indie film with a rom-com twist and a psychedelic soundtrack. If October was about uncovering what haunts you, November is about <em>what you do with the ashes</em>. Are you going to keep poking around in the ruins, or are you finally going to build the fire pit, roast the marshmallows, and invite your higher self to come hang? <br /><br />The astro-weather this month is intense, deep, philosophical, and yes… messy. But in the best “clarity-through-chaos” kind of way. We kick off the month with Mars shifting into Sagittarius on November 4 after an emotionally consuming six-week stint in Scorpio. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars in Scorpio was laser-focused</a>, obsessive, and operating like a detective with a vendetta, chasing one target at a time with no room for distractions. <br /><br />Now, with Mars in Sagittarius, the energy gets more expansive, scattered, and inspired. But don’t let the hype fool you. This isn’t just a sprint toward “bigger and better.” Jupiter (Sag’s ruler) is retrograde in Cancer, so the compass is internal. Expansion for expansion’s sake is out. <em>Heart-led, intuitive expansion</em> is the only way forward. Every opportunity that knocks this month should be questioned: “Do I want this because it’s shiny? Or because my soul says yes?” </p>



<p>The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 is like a cosmic weighted blanket. It’s earthy, ancestral, and anchored in reality, but still deeply sensual and steeped in beauty. Venus rules this moon, and she’ll be in the final degrees of Libra at the time, which adds a soft, romantic, and artful lens to the emotional intensity. There’s an invitation here to release the need to hustle for worthiness. Let your nervous system downshift. Let pleasure be productive. Let simplicity be sacred. <br /><br />Venus joins the Scorpio party on November 6, the day <em>after</em> the Taurus full moon. So while Mars has left the chat, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio energy is still very much holding court</a>. With the Sun, Venus, and later Mercury retrograde all swimming in Scorpio’s dark, transformational waters, the vibe is: “If I can’t bond with you on a soul level, what are we even doing here?” Expect obsessions, secrets, power plays, and some steamy (and possibly confusing) connections. Intimacy is currency this month — spend it wisely. <br /><br />On November 7, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uranus-retrograde-gemini-taurus-september-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Uranus retrograde</a> shifts into the final degrees of Taurus, where it will complete its seven-year revolution through this sign. This is major. Taurus represents our values, our money, our bodies, our land, and our sense of stability. Uranus represents upheaval, revolution, and awakening. Over the next few months, we’re being asked to reflect: How have your core values changed since 2018? What financial, physical, or emotional risks have actually brought you closer to your truth — and what comfort zones have quietly been killing you? These final Uranian activations are wildcards, but they’re also full-circle. Prepare for the plot twists. </p>



<p>Here comes the real kicker: Mercury retrograde begins November 9 in Sagittarius, just five days after Mars enters the sign. And it’s giving existential crisis with a laugh track. Expect mental overload, spiritual rants, lost documents, misunderstood texts, and big ideas that may not land… just yet. You might say too much, or not enough. But it’s all part of the recalibration. <br /><br />Then on November 18, Mercury retrogrades into Scorpio. Cue déjà vu. Whatever themes came up in October when Mercury was originally in Scorpio? They’re back. But this time, you’re not just collecting receipts — you’re reading them aloud and deciding which ones you want to return <em>and which ones you’re keeping as trophies</em>. Lessons will repeat until integration happens. </p>



<p>As if that wasn’t enough, Jupiter retrograde begins on 11/11 in Cancer. If Mercury retrograde is the mental review, Jupiter retrograde in Cancer is the emotional one. Expect tender feels, nostalgia bombs, family karma flare-ups, and a re-evaluation of what emotional security actually means. Jupiter retrograde in Cancer asks: Have you been caretaking others at the expense of yourself? Or avoiding intimacy under the guise of independence? Either way, this is your cue to grow — not by going “out there,” but by going <em>in here</em>. <br /><br />And then — finally — the clouds begin to part. On November 21 at 8:35pm, the Sun enters Sagittarius. That’s when the heaviness begins to lift. Your inner child wakes up. Your passport starts winking at you. There’s laughter again… the kind that surprises you mid-sentence. Sag season reminds us that we don’t always need a plan; we need a vision. And with Saturn finally stationing direct in Pisces on November 27, some of the lessons and limits we’ve been trudging through since June <em>finally</em> start to make sense. You’ve earned your wisdom stripes. Now you get to dance with them. <br /><br />To wrap it all up, Mercury stations direct on November 29, and Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30. So not only are we clearer, but we’re funnier, flirtier, freer. The month ends with a bang… in the best way. So yeah, the first three weeks of November may feel like crawling through an emotional escape room, but the final stretch? It’s giving spiritual carnival. An open road. And if you play your cards right, you’ll end this month with a deeper trust in your heart, your boundaries, your voice — and your ability to rise. <br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>You’re no stranger to fire, Aries, but this month starts in the deep end of water, and asks if you’re really ready to feel the heat that comes from <em>within</em>. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio Season is activating your sector of shared intimacy</a>, soul ties, and karmic debts. That’s not exactly light-and-breezy terrain. Especially with your ruling planet, Mars, still journeying through Scorpio until November 4, you may find yourself quietly wrestling with themes like: <em>“Who do I trust enough to let all the way in?”</em> or <em>“Why do I keep giving energy to situations that don’t pour back into me?”</em> This is the kind of month where you could meet someone and immediately sense their presence in a past life — or finally have a long-overdue financial or emotional breakthrough around shared resources, inheritances, or entanglements. You’re not being dramatic, you’re being spiritually initiated. There’s a difference. <br /><br />Then comes the Taurus Full Moon on November 5, landing in your money and selfworth zone, and things get <em>very</em> real, <em>very</em> fast. Suddenly the spiritual downloads from Scorpio Season have price tags attached: Are you charging what you’re worth? Are you getting paid fairly? Are you spending in ways that align with your values? With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uranus-retrograde-gemini-taurus-september-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Uranus retrograde in Taurus</a> nearing its final degrees, this full moon might trigger a surprising plot twist with your finances or possessions — a job opportunity that wasn’t on your radar, an unexpected payout (or expense), or a radical new way of thinking about your resources altogether. Think of this as a cosmic audit, not a punishment. The Universe is asking: <em>Do your values and your budget actually match?</em> </p>



<p>From November 4 onward, things get feistier, as Mars enters Sagittarius, your zone of adventure, long-term vision, and personal expansion. Suddenly, all those emotional lessons you’ve been processing don’t feel quite so heavy — they feel like motivation. You might feel a deep pull to book that trip, apply to a course, publish your writing, or finally say the thing you’ve been holding back. But heads up: Mercury will be retrograde in this same part of your chart starting November 9, so while you <em>should</em> dream big and speak freely, double-check all logistics, contracts, and travel details. This retrograde may delay or reroute your plans, but not to block you. It’s to help you clarify your “why.” And once Mercury retrogrades back into Scorpio on November 18, you’ll get one last chance to rewire your mindset around fear, power, and desire before moving forward with more clarity and strength. <br /><br />The month ends on an upward note, as Sagittarius Season begins November 21, and Mercury Retrograde wraps up by November 29. You may feel like a fog is lifting, and suddenly the big picture makes sense again. Venus joins Sagittarius on November 30, sprinkling blessings over your long-term goals, education, and spiritual path. You’re not the same Aries you were at the start of the month; you’re deeper, wiser, and more attuned to what motivates you from the inside out. You didn’t just rise from the ashes. You studied the fire, danced with it, and now you’re ready to use it to light up the next chapter of your life. </p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831459.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>November begins with intensity dripping from every interaction, Taurus. Scorpio Season is lighting up your relationship and one-on-one connection sector, and it’s not here for shallow vibes or lukewarm half-commitments. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">With Mars in Scorpio until November 4</a>, your relationships are your mirror — and they’re showing you everything you need to see, especially the stuff you’d rather avoid. This could be a sexy, soulstirring transit for some Bulls (yes, even the emotionally reserved ones), and for others, it could stir tension, jealousy, or unmet needs that have been bubbling under the surface for months. If you’re single, your standards are getting higher — as they should. If you’re partnered, you’re realizing the partnership needs to evolve if it’s going to last. You want more. And you’re not wrong for that.<br /><br />Then comes the Taurus Full Moon on November 5, your annual cosmic spotlight. It’s been a <em>year</em>, hasn’t it? And yet here you are — softer, stronger, and more self-aware. This moon is ruled by Venus, your planetary ruler, which is finishing her journey through Libra before diving into Scorpio the next day. So this full moon is bittersweet: a celebration of how far you’ve come, and a shedding of all the versions of yourself you no longer need to perform. Since Uranus is retrograde in your sign and now in its final degrees, you may feel a deep urge to <em>finally</em> accept how much you’ve changed in the past seven years in appearance, identity, relationships, and direction. What used to define you might feel like an old costume now. Good. Hang it up. Something new is trying to grow in its place. </p>



<p>By mid-month, things start to shift from emotional excavation to deep embodiment. Venus enters Scorpio on November 6, joining the Sun there, and asking you to love deeper, choose wiser, and stay attuned to your real desires… not just the aesthetic ones. Then Mercury retrograde begins November 9 in Sagittarius, your intimacy and merging zone. This can bring back old lovers, contracts, or money matters tied to shared resources. Don’t be surprised if someone from the past wants to “talk.” But you’re not who you were before. You’ve got receipts. And Mercury’s backspin into Scorpio on the 18th will give you the chance to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2021/07/10567193/toxic-relationships-setting-boundaries"">renegotiate your emotional boundaries</a> if you need to. Be honest, but don’t overexplain. Your energy speaks volumes now. </p>



<p>The last stretch of the month opens the portal to real healing. Sagittarius Season kicks off on November 21, encouraging you to take your time before leaping into the next thing. Your soul is still digesting everything you’ve let go of this fall. Saturn goes direct in Pisces on the 27th, helping you re-establish faith in your friendships and long-term dreams, especially the ones that took a back seat this year. And with Mercury direct on the 29th and Venus entering Sagittarius on the 30th, things that once felt emotionally foggy (money, sex, trust) become clearer. You’ve been through the depths and didn’t flinch. Now, you’re ready to trust your body, your desires, and your evolution — even if it doesn’t look like anyone else’s. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831461.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Let’s be real, Gemini — November might start off feeling like molasses. The Sun is in Scorpio, combined with Mars wrapping up its time in your wellness and routine sector, means you’ve been in <em>fix-it</em> mode: fixing your habits, your mind, your environment, your inbox (or trying). But it’s not just about optimizing your calendar… this energy is calling you to ask: <em>What is my life force actually fueling?</em> Your body is speaking louder now. If you’ve been ignoring rest, boundaries, or hydration (you know better!), this month will make you feel it. Let the first week of November be your reset — your personal rehab for burnout, guilt spirals, and emotional avoidance. This is your permission slip to pause and <em>listen</em>. </p>



<p>The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 hits your spiritual sector like a dream download. If you’re someone who has trouble slowing down, this lunation might knock you into stillness through a dream, a sign, or a gut-level knowing. You’re ending a chapter here — maybe a limiting belief or an outdated loyalty. Venus is still in Libra when this full moon peaks, making it an aesthetic moment too. Surround yourself with music, scent, softness. Then, as Venus enters Scorpio on November 6, the vibe gets deeper, more reflective. Your daily rhythms might get a bit moodier, or you may notice you’re craving more alone time than usual. It’s not isolation, it’s a form of integration, especially with Uranus retrograde in Taurus, hovering at the end of a seven-year subconscious transformation. You’re realizing just how much you’ve been rewiring — even the invisible stuff. </p>



<p>Then things get… interesting. Mercury Retrograde begins in Sagittarius on November 9, in your partnership zone. Oh yes, exes may text. Collaborators from the past may circle back. Current partners may say something that makes you go “Wait, what?” But don’t spiral… this is your cosmic cue to <em>review</em> the terms of your emotional contracts. Mercury re-enters Scorpio on the 18th, bringing the focus back to how your boundaries and emotional labor are being managed. If you’ve been doing <em>too much</em> (classic Gemini when anxious), this is your call to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/natural-detox-how-to-cleanse-your-mind"">delegate, detox, and discern</a>. Don’t be afraid to <em>not reply immediately</em>. Mercury’s got you covered. </p>



<p>The final stretch of November is giving plot twist with a happy ending. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2024-meaning-effects"">Sagittarius Season begins on the 21st</a>, energizing your one-on-one connections and reminding you that vulnerability is not a weakness — it’s an invitation to intimacy. Jupiter retrogrades in Cancer starting 11/11, bringing a money mindset reset, while Saturn shifts direct in your career zone on the 27th, helping you take your creative visions more seriously. By the Venus in Sagittarius shift on the 30th, you’re magnetic again — romantic, radiant, and recharged. You’ve done the shadow work, now get ready to flirt with life like the main character you are. Trust: you can do both depth <em>and</em> levity. That’s your superpower. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831462.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>November begins like a poem with a plot twist, Cancer. Scorpio Season activates your sector of creativity, romance, and joy, but it’s a deep kind of joy, not the fleeting fireworks. It’s the kind that comes from healing your inner child. That’s why this month may bring tender feelings to the surface: unresolved heartaches, old crushes, or forgotten dreams asking for a second chance. Mars is here too, stirring up passion and creative urgency. If you’ve been sitting on an idea, this is your green light to birth it. Just know that Scorpio doesn’t do anything halfway. Whether it’s love, art, or sex, you’re either <em>in</em> or <em>out</em> — no halfway intimacy allowed. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 lights up <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/making-friends-connections-adulthood"">your friendship and community zone</a>, helping you see who’s really in your corner. You may realize that a long-standing connection no longer fits the vision of who you’re becoming, and it’s okay to let go with love. Or maybe you’re finally ready to <em>lead</em> in your community, turning a private passion into a public project. Since this Full Moon is ruled by Venus in late Libra, your home life and family dynamics are also highlighted. Beauty rituals, ancestral wisdom, and long phone calls with your favorite cousin are all medicine. And then — bam — Venus enters Scorpio on the 6th, turning your love life into a gothic novel. Think: slow burns, meaningful glances, psychic intimacy. <em>Someone</em> wants to go deeper with you, but can they meet you where you are? </p>



<p>Here’s where the retrograde fun begins. Mercury Retrograde starts in Sagittarius on November 9, shaking up your daily habits, health routines, and work-life balance. You may lose a file. Miss a meeting. Or get a strong urge to quit something that’s draining your spirit. Take a breath… this isn’t sabotage, it’s realignment. When Mercury slips back into Scorpio on the 18th, you’re being asked to rework a creative idea or reconnect with a lover from the past. Don’t romanticize the rewind, but <em>do</em> be curious. Meanwhile, Jupiter retrograde begins in Cancer (your sign!) on 11/11, making the second half of November a mirror. How have you outgrown your own identity? What would expansion look like if it were rooted in <em>self-love</em>, not performance? <br /><br />Then comes the glow-up. Sagittarius Season starts on the 21st, helping you turn chaos into a system. Your task? Find structure that feels <em>freeing</em>, not confining. Saturn shifts direct in your expansion zone on the 27th, grounding you in your truth, and Mercury stations direct in Scorpio on the 29th, freeing up creative blocks or emotional confusion. Finally, Venus enters Sagittarius on the 30th, helping you find joy in the small things again: making your matcha, editing your playlist, flirting in the grocery aisle. November ends with you feeling more <em>you</em> than you’ve felt in a while — bolder, clearer, and ready to move from survival to sparkle. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831463.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>November’s energy begins in your emotional roots, Leo, as Scorpio Season activates your sector of home, family, and your inner world. With Mars also in Scorpio, you may feel more sensitive than usual, even if you’re trying to keep up your bold and brave front. This isn’t the month to push feelings down. It’s the month to look them in the eye. There may be tension with loved ones or a desire to move, rearrange your space, or finally set boundaries with a roommate or parent. You’re reclaiming your sanctuary — physically and emotionally — and it’s not always graceful work, but it’s soul-deep and necessary. Journaling, therapy, crying in the bath… it all counts as progress this month. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 lights up your career and public recognition zone, and the world is watching. You’ve been working on something behind-thescenes, and this lunation could bring praise, press, or even promotion. But it also asks you to reflect: <em>Am I doing this for legacy, or for applause?</em> Venus is still in Libra that day, softening communication and helping you speak your truth kindly, but clearly. The next day, Venus enters Scorpio, adding more intensity to your private life. Expect deeper conversations, late-night pillow talk, and some potent family revelations. It’s like your inner world becomes the real love story of the month, even if that means finally loving yourself in the places you used to abandon. </p>



<p>Mid-month, the retrogrades start stirring things up. Mercury Retrograde begins in Sagittarius on November 9, in your fun, flirtation, and self-expression zone. If a creative idea stalls or a romantic prospect ghosts, don’t panic. Rethink your approach. Ask yourself where the spark went — maybe it’s you that needs rest, not the idea or the lover. When Mercury re-enters Scorpio on November 18, you’re brought back to unresolved emotions at home or with family. A childhood memory may resurface. Or an old version of yourself might be grieving what you’ve outgrown. Don’t rush through the tenderness. Meanwhile, Jupiter Retrograde in Cancer begins on 11/11, lighting up your spiritual zone. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/recurring-dreams-meaning"">Your dreams may be extra vivid</a>. Your ancestors extra loud. Listen. <br /><br />And then: lift off. Sagittarius Season begins on November 21, and you start to feel like <em>you</em> again. Not the Leo who has to hold it all together, but the one who laughs loud, kisses like fire, and shines unapologetically. Saturn shifts direct in your intimacy sector on November 27, helping you better understand what commitment actually means for you — and what’s worth saying yes to. Mercury shifts direct in Scorpio on the 29th, bringing emotional clarity at last. Then Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30, and romance, creativity, and confidence start bubbling again. November ends with your heart wide open — wiser, softer, and still burning bright. </p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831464.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The beginning of November pulls you inward, Virgo. Scorpio Season is activating your communication and inner dialogue sector, and with Mars also in Scorpio, your mind is a hotbed of activity. You might feel more argumentative than usual, or more quick to defend your ideas. But instead of getting stuck in loops or overexplaining, take a beat: <em>Who are you really trying to convince?</em> Others… or yourself? The truth is, this month wants to help you refine your inner voice — to trust it, but also challenge it when it’s stuck in outdated loops. Therapy, journaling, or even audio notes to yourself could be surprisingly clarifying. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 activates your expansion sector, which is all about publishing, travel, and higher learning. Something you’ve been studying, writing, or dreaming about may finally come full circle, and you’ll be asked: <em>Do you still want this?</em> Venus in Libra that day helps you align your values before making any big declarations. But the very next day, Venus enters Scorpio, and suddenly, everything feels more emotionally charged. Your words can cut — or heal — depending on how you wield them. Old conversations may come back for review later in the month when Mercury Retrograde (starting Nov 9 in Sagittarius) retraces its steps, first in your home and emotional sector, then eventually back into Scorpio on November 18. </p>



<p>And yes, Mercury Retrograde in Sagittarius may stir up home drama or nostalgia. You might reconnect with a sibling, parent, or even an old roommate. Or you could find yourself rethinking where you want to live and what kind of foundation you’re building your future on. The Jupiter Retrograde in Cancer starting 11/11 adds an emotional edge to your friendships and long-term dreams. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mid-distance-relationships"">Some relationships might feel distant</a>. But that distance is showing you who truly sees you — and who’s just there for convenience. Not everything that’s consistent is actually nourishing. <br /><br />Then comes relief. Sagittarius Season begins on November 21, and the Sun lights up your foundation, helping you feel more secure and centered. Saturn shifts direct in your relationship sector on November 27, bringing clarity around boundaries and long-term commitment. Mercury shifts direct in Scorpio on the 29th, restoring flow to your conversations and mindset. And to wrap it all up, Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30, helping you beautify your home and maybe even plan a cozy holiday gathering. You’re leaving November with a clearer head, a softer heart, and a deeper understanding of what home <em>really</em> means — inside and out.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831465.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>November wants to talk about your worth, Libra. And not just in terms of money — though Scorpio Season and Mars in Scorpio are definitely heating up your financial sector. This is bigger. It’s about your value system, your sense of self-worth, and how those two things intersect. You’re being asked: <em>Are you charging enough for your gifts? Are you pouring your energy into people who match your frequency?</em> The month starts off intense, especially if you’ve been overextending yourself in order to be liked. No more. You’re recalibrating. Even if that means pulling back. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 lights up your intimacy and merging sector, bringing some financial, sexual, or emotional entanglements to a head. Something’s gotta give. It could be a final bill, a revelation in therapy, or a sexual connection that either deepens or ends. Venus is still in Libra that day, helping you move with grace and charm. But on the 6th, Venus enters Scorpio, and your vibe gets much more private. Suddenly, you’re craving quality over quantity in love, in money, in everything. </p>



<p>It’s giving: “If it doesn’t feel sacred, I don’t want it.” Honor that. Mercury Retrograde begins in Sagittarius on November 9, in your communication zone. So watch what you say and how you say it, and also how you <em>hear</em> others. Miscommunications could spark easily, especially in text or over email. When Mercury retrogrades back into Scorpio on November 18, y<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/low-self-esteem-spending-money"">our money and self-worth come back into focus</a>. If you’re negotiating rates, contracts, or even just trying to figure out your holiday budget, take your time. This retrograde is your chance to revise, not rush. Add in Jupiter Retrograde in Cancer starting on 11/11 — lighting up your career sector — and it’s clear: November is all about long-term alignment, not quick wins.<br /><br />By Sagittarius Season (Nov 21), your voice gets stronger again. You’ll feel like sharing more, laughing more, connecting more. Saturn shifts direct in your daily routine sector on November 27, helping you get back on track with health, organization, or wellness habits that may have fallen off. Mercury shifts direct on the 29th, clearing mental fog. And on November 30, Venus enters Sagittarius, and you’re back in your social butterfly flow — radiant, expressive, and ready to flirt again. You end the month remembering who you are: an artist, a lover, a light. Don’t forget what you’re worth. </p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You are <em>the</em> moment, Scorpio, but you already knew that. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio Season keeps going strong through November 21</a>, and with Mercury also spending time in your sign from November 18th to December 11th, your energy is magnetically focused, deliciously intense, and hard to ignore. You’re in transformation mode, and the world can feel like it’s rotating around your evolution. You’ve likely been tunnel-visioned lately, obsessed with a particular outcome, person, or path. But as Mars shifts into Sagittarius on November 4, it’s time to loosen your grip. The work you’ve done to go deep now wants to expand. But not just anywhere… your soul knows exactly where. <br /><br />Right after Mars exits your sign, the Taurus Full Moon on November 5 illuminates your relationship sector, bringing closure or clarity in love. Someone may surprise you with their emotional maturity, or their lack of it. You’re seeing clearly now. Venus is in her final degrees of Libra that day, moving through your soul and secrets sector, helping you end a chapter with grace. But once Venus enters Scorpio on November 6, you’re magnetic as hell. People are watching you like art. You’re watching them like a hawk. Your beauty is sharper, your desires louder. Love, sex, and money all take on deeper significance, but beware of projecting old wounds onto new people. </p>



<p>The middle of the month gets tricky, though. Mercury Retrograde begins in Sagittarius on November 9, clouding your money mindset and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-confidence-code-a-reminder-that-you-are-worthy"">self-worth sector</a>. Double check receipts, revisit pricing, and be gentle with self-talk. Then on November 18, Mercury dips back into Scorpio, and boom — you’re reviewing your own words, your own intentions. Something you said or decided last month may need to be reworked. Don’t panic. This is a cosmic do-over. Meanwhile, Jupiter Retrograde begins in Cancer on 11/11, activating your publishing, travel, and belief system sector. You may postpone a trip or start questioning your bigger life plans. Let the questions come… They’re clues. <br /><br />And then? Big breakthrough. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2024-meaning-effects"">Sagittarius Season begins on November 21</a>, and with it comes the shift from intense introspection to grounded action. You’re focused on your finances, your value, your legacy. Saturn shifts direct in Pisces on November 27, in your creativity and romance sector, helping you solidify a passion project or commit more seriously in love. Mercury shifts direct in your sign on November 29, unblocking your voice and clarity. And finally, Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30, reminding you that abundance is your birthright, but only when you believe you’re worthy of it. You’ll end the month sharper, sexier, and more self-aware than you began. Phoenix status: reactivated. </p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The month starts in the cocoon, Sag, but it doesn’t stay there for long. With the Sun in Scorpio through November 21, your sector of rest, release, and dreams is activated, nudging you to slow down before your season begins. This is your yearly invitation to clean house spiritually and emotionally. Mars enters Sagittarius on November 4, launching a six-week period of accelerated movement, confidence, and main-character energy. The tension between the two — wanting to retreat and also being pushed into the spotlight — can be confusing at first. But here’s the thing: just because Mars is in your sign doesn’t mean you have to rush. Move with clarity, not chaos. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 lights up your wellness and work sector, helping you re-evaluate your daily habits and rituals. If you’ve been <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/signs-of-anxiety-and-depression-symptoms"">neglecting your body</a> or overextending yourself with work, this lunation is your wake-up call. With Venus at the final degrees of Libra the same day, friendships may play a surprising role in helping you ground yourself. Then Venus enters Scorpio on November 6, stirring hidden feelings. Someone you thought you were over may resurface in your dreams, your inbox, or your heart. This Venus transit moves through your solitude zone, so you might be more sensitive to energetic shifts; don’t dismiss your intuition. </p>



<p>The middle of the month gets hazy. Mercury Retrograde begins in your sign on November 9, making you rethink everything from how you show up online to what you <em>really</em> believe in. If you’re working on a pitch, post, or big reveal, delay it until next month if possible. Jupiter Retrograde in Cancer begins on 11/11, activating your intimacy and soul-merging sector. Emotional boundaries may blur, but this is also a chance to heal old wounds around trust. By November 18, Mercury retrogrades into Scorpio, pushing you back into reflection. Whatever came up during Scorpio Season needs a final purge, so make space. <br /><br />Then your solar rebirth season begins — finally! Sagittarius Season starts on November 21 at 8:35 PM EST, and the shift will feel like a deep exhale. You’re back, baby. The Sun in your sign brings vitality, clarity, and the courage to dream again. Saturn goes direct in Pisces on November 27, stabilizing your home and emotional foundations. If you’ve been navigating family tension or housing uncertainty, things start to feel more solid. Mercury ends its retrograde in Scorpio on November 29, giving you a clearer sense of what to say, or <em>not</em> say. And on November 30, Venus enters Sagittarius, gifting you with charm, beauty, and cosmic flirtation. You’re ending the month glowing, expansive, and ready for your next adventure. </p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the first three weeks of November remind you that even the most selfsufficient mountain goat needs community. Scorpio Season activates your sector of friendships, social networks, and long-term dreams. You may find yourself orbiting new circles, or reevaluating the people who get to be in your orbit at all. Mars enters Sagittarius on November 4, stirring up your sector of closure and healing. This is a sixweek invitation to burn away what no longer resonates with you, especially habits or mindsets you’ve outgrown. With Mars behind the scenes, not everything needs to be public. Power moves can still be made in silence. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 turns your attention to your sector of romance, creativity, and pleasure. You deserve to feel good in your body, and this lunation reminds you of that. Whether you’re deepening a current connection or expressing yourself through your art, something you’ve been nurturing is ready to blossom. With Venus finishing its journey through Libra that day (your career zone), a professional payoff may also arrive — recognition, a collaboration, or a glow-up that reminds you you’ve still got it. But the next day, Venus enters Scorpio, so expect your social life to become deeper, more emotionally layered, and maybe a little more intense. </p>



<p>The middle of the month asks for patience. Mercury Retrograde begins in Sagittarius on November 9, then moves into Scorpio on November 18. Conversations, contracts, or collaborations <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-is-deja-vu-meaning"">may feel like déjà vu</a>. You might revisit an old dream, a past friendship, or a vision for the future that you shelved. Don’t rush to act… just listen. Jupiter Retrograde begins in Cancer on November 11, calling for reflection in your relationship dynamics. Ask yourself: are your partnerships truly reciprocal? Are you overgiving? Or perhaps being too guarded? You don’t have to fix it all this month,. but consistent self-awareness is step one. <br /><br />Sagittarius Season begins on November 21, and it’s your time to slow down before your own season begins. Think of this last stretch of the year as your cosmic hibernation: rest, review, and reconnect with your inner compass. Saturn, your ruling planet, ends its retrograde in Pisces on November 27, making communication, writing, and mental clarity much smoother. You’ll start to feel like your words hold more weight… and they do. Then Mercury shifts direct on November 29, and Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30, softening your inner world and giving you the grace to forgive yourself for how long healing has taken. You’re in deep preparation mode. By next month, you’ll be ready to rise. </p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You’re a visionary, Aquarius, but even visionaries hit fog. Scorpio Season rules your sector of legacy and career, so the first three weeks of November are deeply focused on your purpose. But it’s not just about what you do, it’s about <em>why</em> you’re doing it. Mars’ entrance in Sagittarius on November 4 ignites your sector of community, collaboration, the future. Suddenly, people are reaching out, ideas are flowing, and projects with purpose start calling your name. You’re not just chasing the bag this month — you’re chasing the vision that aligns with your soul’s mission. Still, with Uranus (one of your planetary rulers) retrograding in Taurus, your home, family, or sense of inner stability might feel shaky. Breathe through it. You’re building a new foundation. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 lights up your domestic sector and your emotional center. Something you’ve been suppressing about your past, your upbringing, or even your living situation may come up for release. This is a heart-check moon, one that reminds you to nurture your inner world before building the outer one. And just when you think you’re getting grounded, Venus enters Scorpio on November 6, intensifying your desire for power moves and recognition. Yes, you’re deeply magnetic, but protect your peace. </p>



<p>Mercury Retrograde begins in Sagittarius on November 9, then moves into Scorpio on the 18th. This combo could feel like you’re reworking both your dreams <em>and</em> your professional direction. An old project may return, or a past ambition reawakens. Take notes, but don’t rush. Meanwhile, Jupiter Retrograde in Cancer starts on 11/11 (an ascension portal day!) And nudges you to reconfigure your routines and health habits. Are you doing what actually sustains you, or just what looks good on paper? <br /><br />By the time Sagittarius Season starts on November 21, life gets a bit lighter, more adventurous, and hilarious in that Sag way. The final 10 days of the month bring major energetic shifts: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/saturn-retrograde-in-aries-and-pisces-horoscope-july-2025-meaning-effects"">Saturn ends its retrograde in Pisces on November 27</a>, helping you finally implement new financial or self-worth boundaries. Then Mercury shifts direct on November 29, and Venus enters Sagittarius on the 30th, helping you align with the friendships and collabs that uplift your spirit. You’re not here to follow trends, Aquarius — you’re here to shape the future. So stay weird and stay wise. You’re closer than ever. </p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, November opens with a whisper from your higher self: “You’re evolving.” Scorpio Season rules your sector of wisdom, expansion, and travel, and these first three weeks may feel like a spiritual initiation. Maybe you’re craving distance, space, or perspective. Maybe you’re being pushed to outgrow a belief, a path, or a relationship you once thought was forever. Mars enters Sagittarius on November 4, activating your sector of career, and just like that, the stakes feel higher. You’re climbing a new mountain, Pisces. The next six weeks want you to lead, to be seen, to step into the role you’ve quietly been preparing for. <br /><br />But slow your roll… the Taurus Full Moon on November 5 hits your sector of communication, teaching, and truth. A conversation, message, or idea lands deeply. You could launch something, publish something, or even receive news that shifts your course. With Venus finishing its journey through Libra, your intimacy and financial dynamics reach a point of clarity, and then Venus dives into Scorpio on November 6, bringing <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-finances-transparency-relationship"">emotional transparency into your relationships</a>. Say what you feel, even if your voice trembles. Say what you want, even if you’re not sure how it’ll be received. </p>



<p>The middle of the month is retrograde heavy: Mercury Retrograde in Sagittarius begins November 9 and then Scorpio (Nov 18) may slow career launches or travel plans. You might question the direction you’re heading — don’t panic. That’s part of the process. Then Jupiter Retrograde begins in your fifth house of love, creativity, and joy on November 11, nudging you to reconnect with what lights you up from the inside out. Have you been making space for beauty? For your art? For romantic playfulness? Don’t wait until you burn out… nourish yourself and tend to your needs now.<br /><br />Sagittarius Season starts November 21, and with your career in the spotlight, the pressure may rise, but so does your ambition. Then on the 27th, Saturn shifts direct in your sign after months of restructuring your identity and path. You may feel more grounded in who you are and what you offer. Mercury ends its retrograde in Scorpio on the 29th, and Venus enters Sagittarius on the 30th, ending the month with a boost of charm and cosmic green lights. November ends on a high note: expansive, exhilarating, and a little chaotic in a good way. You’ve done the inner work, Pisces. Now let the world catch up to your brilliance. </p>

Mamacita has many meanings. Literally, it translates to “little mother,” but colloquially it can describe an attractive woman or serve as a sweet nickname for someone dear. For Miami-based fashion label <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcarolinak.com%2Fcollections%2Fmamacita-collection%2Fproducts%2Felsa-cardigan&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fcarolina-k-helena-christensen-mamacita"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Carolina K</a> and model <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/helena-christensen-proves-shes"">Helena Christensen</a>, the name of their newly launched line captures all those nuances — strength, sensuality, and affection — while also honoring the Andean elders who hand-knit each piece.<br /><br />Launched on October 24, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcarolinak.com%2Fcollections%2Fmamacita-collection&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fcarolina-k-helena-christensen-mamacita"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mamacita</a> draws inspiration from both Carolina Kleinman, the Bolivian-Argentine designer who founded Carolina K in 2005, and Christensen, the Peruvian-Danish supermodel, as well as from the South American mothers who shaped them. In fact, the collaboration became a deeply personal creative journey when Christensen returned to her mother’s hometown of Lima, Peru, after decades away. She brought her mother, Elsa, along, and together they reconnected with family while visiting historic neighborhoods and art galleries from their past.<br /><br />“We were in my hotel room looking at all the pieces, and we were all just expressing how important it felt. For them, it was a personal trip, and I got to be part of that,” Kleinman tells Refinery29 Somos.<br /><br />Timed to the 20th anniversary of the Carolina K brand, Mamacita represents both a creative milestone and a heartfelt tribute to the communities that have inspired Kleinman’s vision from the start. For nearly two decades — long before <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/can-fashion-be-sustainable"">sustainability became a buzzword</a> — Kleinman has championed ethical fashion through handcrafted pieces that celebrate ancestral techniques and empower the artisans who keep them alive. Working with makers in remote regions of Mexico, Peru, and India, her brand continues to honor cultural traditions while protecting the planet.<br /><br />“We are not about inventing something new every season. Instead, we want to give what we make a longer life. The more timeless we get to do things, the better it is for everyone,” Kleinman says. “Some things are just classic. And we wanted to create a brand that was classic and meaningful.”<br /><br />From limited-edition hand-embroidered garments and Peruvian-made knitwear to design details inspired by the Andes and the ocean, the collection embodies a timeless elegance.<br /><br />As Kleinman explains, the capsule includes pieces “for every occasion.” In the lookbook, Christensen models the collection in moments that span her life’s journey: dipping into the ocean, walking through the Lima neighborhood of Barranco, attending a dinner party, and wandering the cool mountains. “There’s a look for every moment in our lives, because it represents different women. There’s not one prototype of a woman.”<br /><br />Swipe through to discover some of our favorite pieces from the Mamacita collection.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

<p>The holidays have arrived early at Sephora, and by that, we mean that the retailer’s highly anticipated savings event is back for 2025. Whether you’re eyeing the bevy of sparkly gift sets or looking to repurchase your favorite <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nocturnal-polar-night-serum-review"">luxe serum</a>, Sephora’s <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/beauty/savings-event"">Holiday Savings Event</a> is the time to do just that.</p>



<p>Anyone who’s shopped Sephora’s sales before knows the rules, but if you’re new here, this is the run-down: Depending on your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/05/9843677/sephora-beauty-insider-cash-rewards-program-update-2020"">Beauty Insider membership tier</a> (which goes from Insider, VIB, and Rouge, depending on how much you spend annually), you can get <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/beauty/savings-event"">10, 15, or 20% off</a>, respectively. Rouge members can start shopping on Friday, October 31 (Happy Halloween!), and both VIBs and Insiders get the green light on November 4. <em>All</em> tiers have until November 10 to use the promo code <strong>EVERYTHING</strong> at checkout, which automatically applies the discount according to your membership tier. (Regardless of tier, all Beauty Insider levels can take 30% off all Sephora Collection products from October 31 to November 10, no code needed.) </p>



<p>As with previous years, there’s some fine print to keep in mind as you plan your Sephora haul: Shoppers are limited to two Dyson items (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dyson-hairstyling-tools-worth-it-review"">choose wisely</a>), three <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-flexfusion-styler-review"">Shark Beauty</a> items, three The Ordinary products, and three Nutrafol items per transaction. MAC Cosmetics VIVA GLAM products, in-store services, previous purchases, and gift cards are also not eligible for a discount. But, a <em>major</em> perk of Sephora’s holiday savings event: Snapping up gift sets at a discount.</p>



<p>Now that you have the rules of the road, onto the fun part: Keep scrolling for the most worth-it items to snag during the sale.</p>

<p>Rhode entered Sephora doors this year, and you know what that means: All your dewy skincare essentials are available to shop during the Holiday Savings Event for the first time ever.

<p>If we had a beauty crystal ball, we would forecast that this Danessa palette will be quite the hot commodity for holiday makeup looks this season. Create endless dazzling looks using the entire assortment, or pop out each six-pan palette, remove the magnetic logo mirror in the center, and take it on the go.</p>

<p>If you love niche, luxury fragrance, here’s a name you’ve probably never heard of — for now. From the brains of Melanie Bender (whose resume includes executive roles at Rhode, Versed, and Merit) and Joe Cloyes and Greg Gonzalez (founders of Youth To The People) comes Lore. The collection of four hyper-sensorial, unique fragrances ranges from fruity with a hint of smoky mezcal (Disfruta, seen here) to <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/lovely-a-little-twisted-eau-de-parfum-P517242?skuId=2888469&amp;icid2=products%20grid:p517242:product"">Lovely And A Little Twisted</a>, a milky rose that’s utterly addictive. Best of all: They all clock in at $88 for a full-size bottle — easily half of comparable designer brands — and are fair game during the sale. </p>



<h2 id=""modal2Title""><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/summer-fridays-the-holiday-trio-set-hot-coco-toasted-marshmallow-lbb-mini-jlm-P518536?skuId=2902054&amp;icid2=products%20grid:p518536:product"">Summer Fridays The Holiday Trio Set</a>, $48</h2>

<p>There is stiff competition in the world of tinted lip butters, balms, and treatments — but the Summer Fridays one continues to stand out from its competition time and time again. This cozy set includes two holiday-exclusive flavors (Toasted Marshmallow and Hot Cocoa) alongside a travel-size Jet Lag Mask for skin-quenching hydration.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/big-bitty-setting-spray-superstars-P518405"">ONE/SIZE On ‘Til Dawn Mattifying Waterproof Setting Spray Big &amp; Bitty Duo</a>, $36</h2>

<p>Patrick Starrr’s ONE/SIZE setting spray is goated for a reason: Nothing works better to lock in makeup all day long with a soft matte finish. This holiday set is only $2 more than the full-size, but includes a mini for those all-important touchups. </p>

<p>This time last year, celebrity makeup artist Mary Phillips’ brand, m.ph, was still waiting in the wings. This year, however, is a different story. The versatile complexion palette is already a Sephora bestseller, and thanks to a recent restock, you can snag yours at a discount during the sale. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939826.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p><em>Warning: This story contains graphic details of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2019/10/8643443/15-signs-of-domestic-violence-that-arent-physical"">domestic violence</a>.  </em></p>



<p>I will never forget the night that finally made me leave. My ex-partner and I were at an event with friends. Everything seemed fine until he — as he often did — switched from affectionate to enraged without warning. Throughout the night, he sent me cryptic texts: <em>“I’m watching you. You’ll see what happens when we get home.”</em></p>



<p>The venue was dark and crowded, which allowed him to hide in the shadows. When he finally appeared, I was already in tears. I told him I was done. He grabbed me so tightly I could barely breathe, whispering, “You’ll never leave me.” When I tried to escape, he threw me to the ground and began kicking me—my face, my stomach, my back. I remember praying, <em>“God, please help me get through this.”</em> A friend eventually pulled him off me, and another rushed me outside.</p>



<p>That night, I ran to my sister’s apartment. My best friend joined us, and together they convinced me to call my mother. I didn’t want to; I had been hiding so much from my family, and I knew calling meant going to the hospital and filing a report. I also feared what my ex had always threatened: <em>“If you send me to jail, I’ll kill myself.”</em></p>



<p>When my mom saw my bruised face over FaceTime, she broke down. At the hospital, I was surrounded by police officers and doctors, forced to retell the story again and again. Even then, I tried to protect him—until I learned he and his mother lied to the police, saying I’d fallen down stairs. That betrayal broke something in me. I told the truth. I filed for a restraining order, terrified but determined to protect myself.</p>



<p>When I met him, I was in a vulnerable place and searching for love, something I think now that he sensed. The control and manipulation started subtly—name-calling, jealousy, isolation. I was shocked, yes, but I took it because I convinced myself that he loved me. Then the emotional abuse became physical. I was constantly walking on eggshells, terrified of his next outburst. He would punch walls, throw objects, and then apologize, promising he’d never hurt me again. Like so many survivors, I stayed, believing he could change. I was in a constant state of hope—hope that the man I first met would return, hope that things would go back to “normal.” However, the truth is that there was never anything normal about it.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Domestic violence is not simply isolated or personal; it’s cultural, systemic, and global. It crosses every boundary: race, class, gender, and age.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The abuse only escalated from there. Over time, I became someone I didn’t recognize—isolated, anxious, and ashamed. He would push me against walls, crack drywall, and then threaten to harm himself to pull me back in. I remember breaking down locked doors to stop him from self-harming. Every time I thought of leaving, he’d promise to change—or promise to die.</p>



<p>After that final night, something inside me broke open. I started therapy and eventually found <a href=""https://www.safehorizon.org/"">Safe Horizon</a> through friends and family who told me about the work they do. It was the first time I felt truly ready to speak out.</p>



<p>I learned that my story was not unique, and that’s what makes it so devastating. Domestic violence is not simply isolated or personal; it’s cultural, systemic, and global. It crosses every boundary: race, class, gender, and age. The tactics abusers use are eerily similar: isolation, intimidation, emotional manipulation, and control.</p>







<p>Safe Horizon, the largest victim service nonprofit in the U.S., provides critical resources for survivors of abuse and violent crime. What drew me to them was their inclusive approach—they support survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, sex trafficking, and more. Their <a href=""https://www.safehorizon.org/streetwork/"">Streetwork Project</a> helps young people experiencing homelessness due to abuse, offering food, shelter, medical care, and compassion without judgment. They reach survivors wherever they are, meeting them with dignity and safety.</p>



<p>Too often, young women—especially Black women—don’t feel safe seeking help. We’re told to stay quiet, that no one will believe us, that leaving is pointless. And the question survivors hear most—<em>“Why didn’t you just leave?”</em>—is one of the most harmful. As FKA Twigs bravely shared when <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/arts/music/fka-twigs-shia-labeouf-abuse.html"">speaking about her own experience</a>, that question blames the survivor instead of the perpetrator. Leaving isn’t simple—it’s dangerous. It’s layered with fear, shame, financial dependency, and psychological manipulation. Even after leaving, survivors face systemic challenges: renewing restraining orders, reliving trauma in court, and constantly looking over our shoulders.</p>



<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=5wSrVmPeQSA"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Through Safe Horizon</a>, I found healing, advocacy, and community. The <a href=""https://www.safehorizon.org/about-us/leadership/senior-leadership/"">organization’s leaders</a> like Lisa A. O’Connor and Liz Roberts, create true safety by approaching survivors with empathy, patience, and emotional intelligence. Even small gestures—asking <em>“Do you welcome hugs?”</em>—remind survivors that we have autonomy again.</p>



<p>One of the most profound parts of my healing has been realizing that survival doesn’t mean the pain disappears. It means transforming it. As <a href=""https://grief.com/"">author and grief expert David Kessler wrote</a>, I learned to turn my “pain into purpose”. I use my voice now to help others recognize the signs of abuse before it’s too late. Love should never make you smaller. Real love doesn’t silence, it protects and uplifts.</p>

<p>Calling all fashion lovers because the nineties… and seventies… and sixties called, and they want to be back inside your closets. Luckily, New York-based fashion designer <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/05/11377960/anna-sui-career-collaborations-designers"">Anna Sui</a> was tapped by <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/old-navy-the-occasion-dresses"">Old Navy</a> for its <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/now-trending/anna-sui?cid=3050175&amp;bc=true"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">first-ever designer collaboration</a> — fronted by Y2K-coded singer-songwriter PinkPantheress.<br /><br />“Anna really understands who our customer is, what she wants, how she lives, and we knew this was an amazing moment to bring that,” <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-studio-collection-01-zac-posen"">Zac Posen</a>, creative director of Gap Inc. and chief creative officer of Old Navy, tells Refinery29. “Anna is a design and style icon, and I thought to bring that to another nineties icon, Old Navy, made perfect sense to launch this.” <br /><br />Known for “her whimsy, her magic, her cool, and her rock ‘n’ roll energy,” in the words of Posen, Sui’s <em>Almost Famous</em> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/09/10008469/penny-lane-costumes-almost-famous-kate-hudson-fashion-looks"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Penny Lane</a>-meets-witchy Stevie Nicks aesthetic is on full display with this “Bohemian collection.” Think: <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864620002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175#pdp-page-content"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">faux fur Afghan coats</a> (aka Penny Lane coats), lace cardigans, floral dusters, and <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864614002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175#pdp-page-content"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">satin slip skirts</a> (one of Sui’s favorite styles),<br /><br />But we’re not just swooning over the styles… we’re also thrilled about the prices. “There’s a lot of Anna Sui DNA incorporated into this collection, but made with the expertise of Old Navy, and into very accessible, affordable pieces,” Sui tells Refinery29 about the collection, which ranges between a $10 <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864653002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175#pdp-page-content"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">floral headscarf</a> and $120 <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864630002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">vegan suede coat</a>.</p>

<p>Sui and Posen pulled from the designer’s archives, from flowy tunic dresses, sought-after graphic T-shirts, and velvet laser-cut designs to <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864616012&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175#pdp-page-content"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">reimagining her iconic “grunge dress”</a> (for just $70). Calling the dress style “infamous” and “covetable,” Posen adds: “Now you can have it. It’s just so cool to have that kind of piece of history brought back for you to make your own history.”<br /><br />Speaking on their favorites, Sui and Posen both called out the <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864651002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175#pdp-page-content"">floral mini tunic dress</a> ($65), and offered the styling advice of belting it, pairing with a long coat, or even <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-skirts-over-jeans"">wearing it over jeans</a>. Similarly, they both love the intricate <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864610012&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175#pdp-page-content"">Victorian-inspired button-down top</a> ($50), cozy <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864618022&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175#pdp-page-content"">velvet laser-cut sweatshirt </a> ($45), and unisex <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864646002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175#pdp-page-content"">denim barn jacket</a> ($85), which Posen is planning to add to his own wardrobe.</p>
