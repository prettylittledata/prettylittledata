<p>For decades, musical performances and other non-religious public gatherings were strictly controlled by the Saudi government. This practically confined most forms of public cultural expression, especially music, to the privacy of homes and gated communities. By 2016, the country witnessed wholesale social, cultural, and economic transformations to wean off religious extremism, improve the quality of life, and attract foreign investment. In 2019, a small group of entrepreneurs established Middle Beast (widely known by the acronym MDL Beast) to launch a series of large-scale music festivals across the country. This historic moment represented a dramatic shift in common attitudes towards public gatherings. More importantly, it is considered the first time that the hidden underground culture of electronic music was accessible to the public.</p>",

The scheme builds on the modular system developed by <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/office/addp-architects?ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=search_result_professionals"">ADDP Architects</a>, who designed the buildings using <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/prefabricated-prefinished-volumetric-construction"">Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction (PPVC)</a>. <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/mvrdv/page/1"">MVRDV</a>'s <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/facade"">facade</a> introduces variation across the elevations and marks the locations of the communal green spaces on the 24th floor and the rooftop.

<p>For centuries, the mountainous belt around <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/tbilisi"">Tbilisi</a> has acted as the city's natural filter and refuge. Among these elevations, Tskneti stands out - situated on the eastern slope of the Trialeti Range, where the dense urban grid dissolves into oak and pine forests. Historically perceived as a place of escape, Tskneti offered an alternative to the noise of Tbilisi, a setting where architecture mediated coexistence with nature.</p>",

It’s the first major platform to actually adjust to what a lot of people have been feeling. Our feeds across a broad spectrum of apps are being flooded with low-quality AI slop. The effect is a degradation of trust and an increasing desire to have more control over what we actually see. Pinterest’s move is the first real signal that platforms are recognizing there’s a growing problem instead of pretending that AI generated content and design is the future.</p><p>While I’m not proud to say it, I do occasionally scroll TikTok to kill a few brain cells and a few minutes in my day. My partner also sends me TikToks which she says is her love language, which I in turn use to justify the habit. But these days I’m seeing a trend, there is a <em>stark</em> increase in comments trying to figure out whether a video is AI. We’re literally becoming reality police in the comments of these feeds. Sometimes it’s obvious, there’s that monotoned, programmatically friendly voice playing over a grainy, intentionally retro aesthetic designed to hide AI distortions. But even when it isn’t obvious, people are suspicious. There’s a growing paranoia around what to believe and not believe when scrolling through your feeds on Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok and more.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshots of threads about whether or not a video is AI"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PDf5qkCZYMA69Z6rOqjFAg.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshots of threads about whether or not a video is AI</figcaption></figure><p>It’s a painfully predictable side effect of releasing an unregulated video-generation tool that tries its hardest to pass for reality.

There’s the famous <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9O-8kAnBL2s"">bouncing bunnies video</a> or the progressive pastor video, that went mainstream and gave Sora some early hype. But to me it seems like the hype has evaporated. I don’t know a single person who actually uses Sora.<strong> </strong>Not one. I barely know anyone who even downloaded it! And the people who did opened it once, generated something vaguely cursed, laughed nervously, and then abandoned it.</p><figure><img alt=""Images of videos of Sam Altman doing bizarre things generated by Sora"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*sCSb6GAwY_UMxcBA.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.digit.in/news/apps/openais-sora-app-is-already-flooded-with-disturbing-sam-altman-deepfakes.html"">Images of videos of Sam Altman doing bizarre things generated by Sora</a></figcaption></figure><p>To me it’s unsurprising, as it seemed like the main use case for downloading the app was making creepy videos of <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-openai-sora-app-ai-videos-2025-10"">Sam Altman being mocked</a> in increasingly bizarre and slightly more humiliating situations. Along with a string of racially insensitive videos of MLK making fake speeches, which were eventually disallowed after the very busy ethicist of open <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0g79xevxo"">AI Olivia Gambelin told the BBC OpenAI that limiting further use of Dr King’s image was “a good step forward”</a>. Not only were there weird historical recontextualized videos but also blatant copyright infringements of famous characters. Which we all know is a favourite of OpenAI. Videos on Sora are considered a “success” when they reach escape velocity and seep into mainstream content, which is a strange metric for anything, let alone for a CEO who keeps insisting this tech is “inevitable.”</p><p>But all of this “inevitability” talk from AI tech CEOs is starting to wear thin. Sure, we exist within certain systems. Yes, capital moves the way capital moves. But companies only have power because users hand it to them. When people walk away and engagement drops the inevitability story starts to look flimsy.</p><p>It’s been a awhile now since the first big wave of AI models started generating shockingly polished visuals. And I’ll be honest: sometimes the results are impressive! But my standards for AI are different from my standards for humans. There is still a huge amount of rich, deeply human art being made every day as well as a huge historical trove to dig through that is fundamentally more interesting because it comes from people with taste and lived experience.</p><p>Also the hard truth for AI generated content is that the people who can make beautiful things already are the ones best positioned to make beautiful AI-assisted things. And what are their incentives? Across the board creatives are getting fired because of the threat of AI replacement, why would they be the first to hop onboard to support a tool that’s literally trying to take their jobs. Right now it seems like lot of AI content online comes from people with no creative background dumping average outputs into the feed. People are trying their hand at it, making something new from nothing, and while I admire the spirit in that the harsh truth is it adds almost nothing.</p><p>It turns out making something good that people care about is extremely hard. And making something great is harder still. Great work in my view is inherently collaborative, political, relational. It requires conflict, iteration, and concession. You can’t flatten all of that into a prompt without losing what makes it resonate. Most recently <a href=""https://www.vice.com/en/article/openai-is-getting-into-the-movie-business-with-critterz/"">OpenAI announced that they would be making an AI first movie called Critterz for under 30 million</a> as an attempt to try and show the power of AI in film/animation production. But it does beg the question, why is it that OpenAI has to front the cash here? Maybe it’s because independent filmmakers aren’t interested in leveraging this tool? If it was truly a great tool for filmmakers, we would already be hearing about the new voices breaking through the cultural marketplace signalling the importance of this new medium. It ain’t happening!</p><figure><img alt=""Image of AI generated characters from upcoming OpenAI film Critterz"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JauRQvulDh1F49f4x_DiFQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.vice.com/en/article/openai-is-getting-into-the-movie-business-with-critterz/"">Image of AI generated characters from upcoming OpenAI film Critterz</a></figcaption></figure><p>Oftentimes when I tell this to AI boosters there’s this pushback that it’s only getting better and better, and while yes the fidelity and realism is increasing, I have yet to feel the rumblings of a creative AI revolution. I firmly believe you cannot collapse a lifetime of discipline and taste into a few paragraphs of prompting. You can’t try and remove collaboration and expect a better product. Yes, I’ve seen beautiful AI imagery, but they are the exceptions, not the rule. And more importantly: no one is asking for more of it, in fact they’re asking <strong>for less</strong>.</p><p>When people identify a video as AI, it’s usually to warn others not to trust it. That alone tells you what demand actually looks like. Most social platforms exist on human-generated content and I think the flood of AI slop is not likely to increase engagement. We all buy into this story that AI will optimize for our attention, stimulating the exact parts of our brain to create dopamine zombies and while I don’t deny that’s certainly possible, I do think that it’s actually quite unlikely. There is still no comparison between human content and AI content from a quality perspective.</p><p>Pinterest’s new filter lets users reduce or outright hide AI-generated content. TikTok is now testing a similar feature. And I know I’ll be turning it on the second it becomes available. No one begged for this influx of AI content. It doesn’t solve a problem that actually existed or if it does, I certainly can’t put a finger on it. It’s a novel toy that has overwhelmed entire corners of the internet, suffocating feeds and making us all paranoid and platforms are finally starting to admit it. While they’ll never say “our feeds were drowning in AI nonsense and users hated it.” features speak louder than words. When Pinterest gives you the option to filter out AI, and <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/tiktok-now-lets-you-choose-how-much-ai-generated-content-you-want-to-see/"">TikTok rushes to pilot something similar</a>, the message is clear: <strong>people want the human internet back.</strong></p><p>I have hope that creativity online won’t be defined by who has the most generative models pumping out piles of content. The novelty of AI is already wearing off and the fatigue is very very real. If platforms want engagement, if they want trust or if they want actual culture to keep happening on their watch, they’re going to have to give us control over our feeds, including the ability to filter out, reduce, or completely remove AI-generated content.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3e832e8ad0d0"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-internet-needs-an-ai-off-switch-3e832e8ad0d0"">The internet needs an AI off switch</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

She grew up surrounded by tutors, books and expectations that her intellect would remain a private accomplishment. When she took to history, philosophy and mathematics with a seriousness that made her parents uneasy, well, that wasn’t the goal they were going for. Knowledge, in their view, was for refinement (or so they’d hoped).</p><p>By her late teens, she had begun pushing against the edges of what society considered acceptable for someone of her background. Nursing, at the time, was not an esteemed profession. It was closer to domestic labor, associated with poverty, poor training and conditions that respectable families wanted nothing to do with. The thought of Florence entering that world was, to her parents, pretty unthinkable.</p><p>Beyond her house, Europe was shifting.</p><p>The British Army was expanding its presence abroad. Hospitals weren’t prepared for the scale or severity of the injuries they received. Medical infrastructure was inconsistent, oversight was minimal, and record-keeping existed but didn’t translate into updated policy or changes in care.</p><figure><img alt=""A detailed nineteenth-century illustration of the Battle of Balaklava showing chaotic close-quarters fighting between cavalry and artillery units.

They weren’t. Reports of catastrophic conditions reached London. Overcrowded wards, contaminated water, shortages of supplies, and mortality rates that dwarfed expectations. Public pressure mounted, and the government needed a response that looked decisive.</p><p>Nightingale was asked to lead a team of nurses to the military hospital in Scutari.</p><p>She accepted, arriving to find a system overwhelmed not only by the war, but by a number of hard to overcome assumptions.</p><p>This is where most accounts of Florence Nightingale begin to lean on the familiar imagery. The lamp, the night rounds, the comforting presence in a place defined by suffering.</p><p>While that version is true enough to persist, it leaves out the part that gives her work its lasting impression, and why it’s the subject of this week’s unquoted.</p><p>The moment she stepped into Scutari, she realized the crisis was much more than medical.</p><p>She had entered an information crisis.</p><p>The hospital produced records, but the records concealed more than they revealed. Deaths were counted, but not categorized. Conditions were noted, but not analyzed. The data existed, but it carried no structure that could lead anyone toward responsibility.</p><p>And this is where the story takes a turn.</p><p><strong>The Florence Nightingale we’re here for is the woman who recognized that the health of an institution depends on the clarity of the information that shapes its decisions.</strong></p><h3>No decision strategy = hope</h3><p>When Nightingale began working through records at Scutari, her goal was to understand how a hospital this large could operate with so many people and have so little sense of direction. Ledgers were full (supplies, patient counts, daily notes) but nothing in them hinted at anything actionable. The information described activities being completed, but not anything about that activity’s implication.</p><p>Over time, this problem persisted. Reports were produced because that was the routine. No one had agreed on what those reports were meant to surface, which scenarios mattered, which changes signaled risk, or which patterns required action. Without that understanding, documentation became a ritual — evidence that work had occurred, not evidence that anything had been understood.</p><p>This pushed Nightingale to stop reading the reports as documentation and start reading them as evidence of how little the institution understood itself. The hospital was active… busy, even… but that activity had no correlation.</p><p>Here’s what’s interesting. Decisions weren’t necessarily being avoided. People in power didn’t know what decisions they’d make if the right information presented itself. Their entire operation was basing itself on activity, optimism and ‘God’s will’ (which is a form of fate that requires no responsibility because it assumes none is possible).</p><p>Nightingale knew the only way forward was to be clear about the goal and then to look for the signals that would tell her whether that goal was getting closer or slipping further away. If the aim was fewer deaths, then she needed to understand what conditions made death more likely, and which of those conditions could be influenced by decisions inside the hospital. That meant defining the kind of evidence that would force a change in course, and then arranging the information so those inflection points (signals) could be seen.</p><p>She worked through the records with that question in mind. Not “what happened?” but “what would have made us act sooner?” Once she separated preventable deaths from battle wounds, organized the accounts in intervals that revealed trends, and drew distinctions that had never been documented with any seriousness, the crisis took on a shape the institution couldn’t look past. The patterns had been buried under routine, but they were unmistakable.</p><figure><img alt=""A polar-area chart showing monthly mortality in the British Army from April 1854 to March 1855. Each wedge represents a month, with green areas indicating deaths from nonbattle causes and orange areas showing deaths from battle. The green segments dominate most months, especially in winter, illustrating that disease and poor conditions caused far more deaths than combat. The chart is based on Florence Nightingale’s 1858 statistical work."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XJpZCcrZmsuWeJnVEiAEYA.png"" /><figcaption>Coxcomb Chart: The English nurse Florence Nightingale was an innovator in displaying statistical data through graphs. In 1858 she devised the type depicted here, which she named Coxcomb. Like pie charts, the Coxcomb indicates frequency by relative area, but it differs in its use of fixed angles and variable radii.</figcaption></figure><p>Her work made the responsibility clear. She identified the decisions that mattered and then arranged the information around those decisions so the institution could no longer look away from its own role in the outcomes. Once the data showed the hospital was contributing to the deaths, the excuses fell apart. Their work had to change.</p><h3>Where organizations lose the plot</h3><p>The pattern Nightingale uncovered isn’t confined to a nineteenth-century hospital. We produce so much information, yet struggle with the same absence of direction. Metrics pile up. Dashboards expand. Data becomes a security blanket for activity. Ask a team what decisions any one of their numbers is meant to influence, and the answer may disappoint you. But hey, the dashboard looks compelling, right?</p><p>The problem starts early. Most organizations begin with the data they have, or the data they want, and work backward into meaning. Nightingale did the opposite. She started with the decision. She asked what needed to be understood, what changes mattered, and what signals would make a different course unavoidable.</p><p>There’s a simple discipline in that sequence.</p><p><strong>Start with decisions</strong><br />Instead of asking what additional data might be useful, ask which decisions need to be made more quickly, more confidently or with greater precision. A metric only matters if it changes a decision.</p><p><strong>Translate decisions into signals</strong><br />Once decisions are clear, the next step is to name the behaviors or conditions that would trigger movement. These signals tie to action, connecting behavior to strategy.</p><p><strong>Then map signals to the data</strong><br />Only after the signals are understood does the question of data come into play. Which information reflects those signals? Which is reliable? Which is unnecessary? This prevents teams from collecting numbers for their own sake and turns data into something closer to what Nightingale built (which was a structure that makes responsibility visible).</p><figure><img alt=""A historic photograph of Florence Nightingale standing in a dark dress with lace details, wearing a white bonnet.

There’s a gap between what’s happening and what’s being said. The choice is to either declare the situation unfair and leave the responsibility where you found it… or you can step closer, notice what isn’t being noticed, and take on the work the institution isn’t prepared to do.</p><p>When Nightingale chose the second path and saw that conditions at Scutari were overwhelming, every excuse was available to her… war, fate, limited resources, the failures of others. Instead of accepting them, she studied what didn’t add up, verifying what the reports wouldn’t show. None of it was convenient. None of it was glamorous, and nearly all of it was thankless.</p><p>But as with every unquoted, that’s the work the greats take on.</p><p>Nightingale was trying to see the situation clearly enough that responsibility had somewhere to ‘land’. Her nighttime rounds weren’t mythology or symbolism. This was the work of a woman who understood that improvement begins where convenience ends.</p><p>It takes someone great to take on that kind of work.<br />She did, and it was about a lot more than a lamp.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3705e128c123"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/florence-nightingale-on-vanity-metrics-3705e128c123"">Florence Nightingale on vanity metrics</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<p>I was warned about<em> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYcgQMxQwmk"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hamnet</a>. </em>Anyone who knows me knows that I am a crier and that I am easily susceptible to emotional manipulation; whether it’s a schmaltzy commercial with an intergenerational storyline or a corny Hallmark movie about the healing capacity of Christmas, I will weep. So, when it comes to a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/marvel-eternals-director-chloe-zhao-interview"">Chloe Zhao</a> directed, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/26/movies/hamnet-review.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">critically-lauded drama</a> about the loss of a child and art as a tool to cope with grief, people in my life knew that it would break me. And despite their disclaimers, it did.</p>



<p><em>Hamnet</em> unfolds slowly, telling the story of William Shakespeare (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/paul-mescal-normal-people-season-two"">Paul Mescal</a>) and his wife Anne Hathaway, or Agnes Shakespeare (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/jessie-buckley-lost-daughter-interview"">Jessie Buckley</a>) as she’s known in this adaptation of Maggie O’Farrell’s book <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/books/review/hamnet-maggie-ofarrell.html""><em>Hamnet: A Novel of the Plague</em></a>, as they fall in love and have three children including their son, Hamnet. The names Hamnet and Hamlet were often used interchangeably back then and this is O’Farrell’s interpretation of what led to Shakespeare’s masterpiece. </p>



<p>In the first half, <em>Hamnet</em> is about the tender beginnings of a relationship and the complexity of marriage. It’s about a free spirit and a neurotic writer navigating their different desires and a long-distance relationship. There are sly nods to Shakespeare’s most famous work, like the fact that William and Agnes are star-crossed lovers as he presumably scribbles down<em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/11/127977/romeo-and-juliet-movie-what-is-true-love""> Romeo &amp; Juliet</a> </em>by candlelight or that William’s relationship with his dad proves Shakespeare’s daddy issues were in full effect. The subtlety stops there. The second half of <em>Hamnet </em>is unflinching, a devastating portrait of the grief that accompanies unconditional love. At certain moments, <em>Hamnet</em> made me angry; I was begging for a break from the onslaught of emotional tyranny it was reigning over its audience. At others, I was grateful for its vulnerability and unabashed sentimentality. If Zhao and co. were manipulating me into crying so hard I had a headache for hours after the credits rolled, it worked. Anything that succeeds in eliciting that much emotion and draws out these extraordinary performances from two of the best actors of their generation is, to me, a triumph.  </p>



<p>When I speak to Mescal and Buckley over Zoom, they’re a lot gigglier than you may expect considering both are known for playing roles that rip your heart out and give your tear ducts a workout. They are thoughtful, polite, and playfully rib each other with the ease of old friends. Below, the Irish actors talk about the emotional weight of <em>Hamnet</em>, the first movies that made them cry, and gush about their co-star to the hilarious discomfort of the other. </p>







<p><strong>Refinery29:</strong> <strong>I’m sure you’ve gotten this a lot today but this movie fucked me <em>up</em></strong><strong>. I was sobbing hysterically by the end. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal: </strong><em>[Both laugh].</em></p>



<p><strong>I feel like people need a disclaimer that they are going to cry a lot. Can you just give a warning or any advice on how to prepare for the emotional experience of watching this film? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Jessie Buckley: </strong>To feel is quite scary. To feel at all is scary. I think we try to control what that is in our lives and in some ways, there’s so much catharsis to connect again to the epicness of just being alive. And this film is so full of love. It’s so full of the courage to love fully and to live fully, and to lose. And anytime you choose to love, you also choose to potentially lose. You’re risking to lose somebody in your life. But I think there’s a lot of catharsis and hope and healing in this film, and you’re not on your own. There’s going to be somebody beside you who’s going to have a tissue, and they’re going to give it to you, and you’re going to have a big chat and a hug afterwards and you’re going to think<em> that was great.</em></p>



<p><strong>Paul Mescal:<em> </em></strong><em>[laughs] </em>Okay, that was great! </p>



<p><strong>Make it a community experience! </strong></p>



<p><strong>JB:<em> </em></strong><em>[laughs] </em>That wasn’t my experience. I locked myself in a toilet for half an hour afterwards. </p>

<p><strong>Yes, I needed to decompress! Do either of you remember the first movie that made you cry or made you feel like this film does? </strong></p>



<p><strong>JB: </strong>Yes,<strong> </strong><em><a href=""https://www.disneyplus.com/browse/entity-35142c55-bb03-459c-8646-302379fb29b6"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Darby O’Gill and the Little People </a></em>[1959]<em>. </em>Because there was a banshee and I thought that was the most terrifying thing in the whole wide world. I was inconsolable. Have you seen it? I mean, it’s not a huge hitter, it’s quite niche.</p>



<p><strong>PM: </strong>What’s it called again? </p>



<p><strong>JB:  </strong><em>Darby O’Gill and the Little People. </em></p>



<p><strong>PM: </strong>That’s not a real movie.</p>



<p><strong>JB:</strong> <em>[laughs]</em> It is a movie! </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>[Paul] has such a gigantic human heart, and he’s such a team player. He holds the biggest parts of you. He can drink a case of you, and not many people can.</p><cite>jessie buckley on paul mescal</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>Paul, what’s the first movie that made you cry? </strong></p>



<p><strong>JB: </strong>He’s going to say something profound. </p>



<p><strong>PM: </strong>No, Tír na nÓg [<em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_ETqGhF61A"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Into The West</a></em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_ETqGhF61A"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">, 1992</a>]. </p>



<p><strong>JB:</strong> Oh yeah, that’s lovely. </p>



<p><strong>JB and PM</strong><em> [in unison]</em>: The potato and the horse! </p>



<p><strong>JB: </strong>Yeah, that made me cry.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11945979.jpg?width=680&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=85%3A128"" /><figcaption>4238_D004_00159_R

<p><strong>Well, you both made <em>me</em></strong><strong> cry. But the movie doesn’t work without your chemistry. William and Agnes are two big characters to embody and you both did so beautifully. I want to give you a moment to look at each other and gush about working with each other and what makes each other so great. </strong></p>



<p><strong>PM:</strong> Jessie is just [<em>laughs</em>] — This is not just a performance of the year, this is a performance, and I’ve said this before, but this is going to be studied in drama schools. Actors around the world, if you want to see what great acting is, not only just watch <em>Hamnet</em>, watch anything that Jessie has ever been in, and you’d be well fed. And that’s all the time we have for today! [<em>laughs</em>] </p>



<p><strong>JB:</strong> No <em>[laughs]</em>. I feel like I’ve met somebody so significant and giant in my life in working with Paul on this. Firstly, he is absolutely… No, firstly, he has the most…  </p>



<p><strong>PM:</strong> <em>[laughs] </em>Firstly, <em>Darby O’Gill and the Little People. </em></p>



<p><strong>JB: </strong><em>[laughs] </em>No, no! He has such a gigantic human heart, and he’s such a team player. He holds the biggest parts of you. He can drink a case of you, and not many people can, especially co-leads. Not many people can just, with absolute care and courage, help you to tell the story. I mean this with so much sincerity and belief: he is a movie star, and he wears it — </p>



<p><strong>PM: </strong><em>[nervous, uncomfortable laughter] </em></p>



<p><strong>JB:</strong> No, you are! You just are. It’s true for you, and that’s because you have this capacity of being a giant. You are a giant person.</p>



<p><strong>PM:</strong> I am of average height <em>[laughs]. </em></p>



<p><strong>JB: </strong> <em>[laughs]</em> No, your heart is gigantic. It’s no coincidence that he’s going from playing William Shakespeare to <a href=""https://www.etonline.com/media/videos/paul-mescal-on-taking-on-shakespeare-in-hamnet-and-paul-mccartney-in-beatles-biopic"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Paul McCartney,</a> and being a gladiator. Not many people can manage that, and he can, and that’s because of who he is as a man.</p>



<p><strong>PM: </strong>That was lovely. </p>

<p>There are a few details going on in <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/basecoatstories/"">Jasmin’s</a> holiday manicure but the overall effect is surprisingly subtle. The secret? Pairing the block color nails and the alternative French tips with a negative space design.</p>

<p>If there’s one thing we can count on Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers for, it’s a hyper-specific pop culture reference. For the last decade, the comedic duo have mined the deepest corners of queer cultural zeitgeist on their podcast<em> Las Culturistas</em>, which snagged iHeartRadio’s Podcast Of The Year Award in 2023. This holiday season, their new <a href=""https://www.marshalls.com/us/store/index.jsp"">Marshalls</a> campaign — <a href=""https://www.marshalls.com/us/store/shop/marshalls-it-s-giving-gifts/_/N-3830075267"">It’s Giving Gifts!</a> — channels their encyclopedic archive of niche archetypes into the highest form of holiday-season community service: helping shoppers find the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-art-of-giving"">perfect present for every type of person</a> in their lives.<br /><br />From best gifts <a href=""https://www.marshalls.com/us/store/shop/marshalls-it-s-giving-gifts/_/N-3830075267?icid=11.17.25:Marshalls:Homepage_Desktop::Its_Giving_Gifts_Block1_All"">“for the homebody who loves their sourdough starter more than you, and you have accepted that”</a> to selections for <a href=""https://www.marshalls.com/us/store/shop/marshalls-it-s-giving-gifts-made-in-italy/_/N-2758068732?auxcid2=11.10.25:Marshalls:LP_Desktop:Its_Giving_Gifts:MII"">“the cool girl who is always late and makes you think punctuality is kind of embarrassing”</a> and <a href=""https://www.marshalls.com/us/store/shop/marshalls-it-s-giving-gifts-gifts-for-teens/_/N-3954653793?auxcid2=11.10.25:Marshalls:LP_Desktop:Its_Giving_Gifts:For_Teens"">“the teen who has so much drip you were left with no choice but to use the word “‘drip’ to describe them”</a> — each gift guide offers meticulously curated, cross-category selections from designer labels and beloved brands at a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-luxury-gifts-under-50"">wide variety of price points</a>. <br /><br />“Saying that you love Marshalls is like ordering Diet Coke for the table,” Yang tells Refinery29 while we chat in-store at Marshalls in Manhattan. “You empower other people to say something they thought was buried: ‘Oh, wait, I’ve always loved Marshalls too.’”<br /><br />Below, Yang and Rogers share their best tips for picking the perfect gift, their most formative holiday memories, and the greatest presents they’ve ever given — and received.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>





<p><strong>Let’s talk about my personal favorite gift-guide archetype — gifts for “the cool girl who is always late and makes punctuality seem kind of embarrassing.” To reference the recurring segment on your podcast — what are the cultural moments that made this cool girl who she is today?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Bowen Yang</strong>: We all know this girl. We might even be this girl. This girl saw <em>Mean Girls</em> in theaters at least 5 times in 2004. She really imprinted on — not Romy and Michelle — but she identified with their bullies. Maybe [they identify] with Janeane Garofalo ’cause they like a quick-smoke cigarette because they have places to be and they are always late to those places.<br /><br /><strong>Matt Rogers: </strong>I would say it’s that girl from high school who you’re like: “You learned the wrong thing from Regina George.”  But… she looked good.</p>



<p><strong>There’s so many cute purses and shoes in the “cool girl” gift guide. Where is the cool girl wearing these accessories while out and about in Manhattan?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Yang: </strong>She’s taking this to Balthazar, Carbone, the Whitney, the Circle Line Cruise so she can swing around [her purse] while the DJ plays a song on a boat. <br /><br /><strong>Rogers:</strong> She’s going to take this to Zero Bond. She’s going to walk past Taylor Swift, and Taylor’s gonna go: “So sorry, where did you get that bag?” She’ll say: “Marshalls.” And she’s going to wink at Taylor, and Taylor’s gonna be like: “Travis, we gotta go. Let’s get to Marshalls.” </p>





<p><strong>Be honest, did you have any specific friends in mind when creating the “cool girl”” gift guide?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Yang: </strong>I would say our friend Greta [Gerwig] — who we love. Greta is giving both Sabrina Carpenter and early aughts SJP, plus the dad’s girlfriend from <em>The Parent Trap</em>.<br /><br /><strong>Rogers: </strong>Yeah. Any stepmother from any movie where the stepmother comes in and is like: “It’s off to boarding school with you.” But we love that stepmother. We aspire to be her.</p>



<p><strong>For the person who just can’t decide on a gift — what picks from your gift guides do you think are the most universal crowd-pleasers?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Yang: </strong>Silk pajamas, skincare… this bag is a star. <a href=""https://www.marshalls.com/us/store/jump/product/Rhinestone-Handbag/4000410744?colorId=NS4155705&amp;pos=1:33&amp;Ntt=silver%20purse&amp;bsp=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">This bag</a> has been with us the entire campaign. And I will never forget about her — she’s high impact. <br /><br /><strong>Rogers: </strong>And you really can’t go wrong with a candle.</p>





<p><strong>You’re clearly both great gift-givers — but what about receiving? Was there a childhood gift that genuinely shaped who you are today</strong><br /><br /><strong>Rogers: </strong>This was the year that PlayStation 2 came out. I was a video game kid — Bowen Yang still is — and I really wanted that PS2. And they were like: “You’re not getting it. It’s too expensive and no one can get it.” And then on Christmas day, I kept opening up PS2 games, and I was like: “Well, I guess you got me the games for one day when I get the system, right?” They were like: “Exactly, one day when you get the system.” Low and behold, the last gift hiding under the couch was the PS2, and I was a very happy boy.<br /><br /><strong>Yang: </strong>Mine was after <em>Batman Forever </em>came out. I had a Batgirl, Alicia Silverstone action figure — that really spoke to me and has since. </p>



<p><strong>What’s the most unexpected place you’ve ever spent the holidays?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Yang: </strong>Someone in my family recently pitched, out of nowhere: “What about Scottsdale this Christmas?” I said: “What about it? We don’t know anybody there.” No shade to Scottsdale it’s just like… why would we go there? <br /><br /><strong>Rogers:</strong> I will be doing a Tampa Christmas because my parents snowbird down there. People who know me are like: “Matt Rogers, Florida for Christmas, checks out.”</p>





<p><strong>What are your favorite types of gifts to give? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Yang: </strong>Candles are a go-to. I think we’re finally, as a culture, coming out of the stigma around candles as gifts. For a while there, it was like: “Oh, you got a candle? How impersonal.” No. No one’s gonna turn down a candle.</p>



<p><strong>Rogers: </strong>I really hit the jackpot one year when I realized that I could get bespoke drink coasters and customize them for my friends. So I got coasters with different pop stars on them and I gave them to all my friends for the pop star that they stan. And I do think that was my best idea and now I have to think of something else creative.</p>

You can probably think of ten Christmas movies off the top of your head, but when it comes to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/11/180821/thanksgiving-movies-on-netflix"">Thanksgiving movies</a>, that's not so easy. Even though, like Christmas, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/11/10172292/thanksgiving-alone"">Thanksgiving is a holiday when people spend hours</a> sitting around doing nothing but eating, but there aren't many feel-good Thanksgiving-specific movies to watch while you're doing all that sitting around. Make us some genuine Turkey Day rom-coms, Hollywood!<br /><br />Until that happens, there are actually <em>some</em> Thanksgiving movies out there. We've rounded up 14 of them, ranging from movies that are actually Thanksgiving-focused to good movies that that merely contain Thanksgiving scenes, to one that is definitively <em>not</em> about Thanksgiving because it definitively <em>is</em> about the mob. We have our reasons; just hear us out.<br /><br />But don't expect to get too many of the warm and cozy feelings with these Thanksgiving movies, like you do with Christmas films. A lot of them are about estranged family members and fights at the dinner table, whether they're dramas or comedies or some mix of the two. But, hey, maybe something a little emotional and relatable is what you need during this stressful time of year. <br /><br />If not, there's also a superhero movie on this list. In case you didn't know, Spider-Man eats Thanksgiving dinner, too. <figure><figcaption><h2><em>Addams Family Values</em></h2>Hear us out. Sure, <em>Addams Family Values </em>isn't fully about Thanksgiving, but it does have one of the most <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We_Ztqv9FJU"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">iconic Thanksgiving scenes</a> in movie history. During a Thanksgiving play at Camp Chippewa, Wednesday (Christina Ricci) and her friends go rogue and decide to adapt their counselor's script to more accurately depict the real events that led to Thanksgiving and in true Wednesday fashion, mayhem ensues. If you love Wednesday on Netflix, this season is the perfect time to revisit this classic. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>Pieces of April</h3></em><br />Let's start with a movie that is explicitly about Thanksgiving. Katie Holmes stars in 2003's <em>Pieces of April</em>, a dramedy about a young woman who invites her estranged family to Thanksgiving dinner in her New York City apartment. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>Holidate </h3></em><br /><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/10/10132405/holidate-netflix-emma-roberts-rom-com-lead"">Holidate</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/10/10132405/holidate-netflix-emma-roberts-rom-com-lead"">, which was dropped on Netflix</a> this year, is a Thanksgiving movie because it's an every holiday movie. Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey star as two people who pretend to be dating at every holiday gathering that they're invited to in order to avoid questions about being single. Of course, they start to actually have feelings for each other. It's not great, but it's the closest we've got to a Thanksgiving rom-com right now.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Sweet November</em></h2><br />Who doesn't love some romance and emotional manipulation over the holidays? <em><a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/60004446"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sweet November</a></em>, starring Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron, may have been panned by critics when it came out in 2001, but it's got a cult following of fans who love the sweet story of an overworked, selfish workaholic (Reeves) who falls for a free spirit (Theron) after moving in together for the month of November. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>The Oath</h3></em><br /><em>The Oath</em> is a comedy about a family who gets together for Thanksgiving just as the U.S. asks residents to sign a ""Patriot's Oath."" Things get more unhinged from there. Ike  Barinholtz, who also wrote and directed, and Tiffany Haddish star.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>Home for the Holidays</h3></em><br /><em>Home for the Holidays</em> stars Holly Hunter as a single mom who visits her family for Thanksgiving after losing her job. Her wacky relatives include Robert Downey Jr. as her brother and Anne Bancroft as her mother. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>Friendsgiving</h3></em><br />A group of friends — and a sassy mom played by Jane Seymour — get together at a big, gorgeous house for a Thanksgiving full of drinking and innuendos. Malin Åkerman, Aisha Tyler, Kat Dennings, Chelsea Peretti, and more make up the ensemble cast. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>Miracle on 34th Street </h3></em><br />Yes, <em>Miracle on 34th Street</em> is a classic Christmas movie, but it's also technically a Thanksgiving movie since it starts with the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The story about the parade's Santa (Edmund Gwenn) claiming to actually be the real Santa continues from there.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>Planes, Trains and Automobiles</h3></em><br />Steve Martin stars in <em>Planes,</em> <em>Trains and Automobiles</em> as a man who is trying to get home to his family for Thanksgiving, but due to a flight issue, ends up stuck with a traveling salesman (John Candy). They set off on an adventure filled with hijinks as they try to make their way to Chicago.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>Krisha</h3></em><br />If you're in the mood for something dark this Thanksgiving, look no further than <em>Krisha</em>. It stars director Trey Edward Shults actual aunt Krisha Fairchild as a woman suffering from addiction, who visits her family for Thanksgiving after years of being estranged.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>The Ice Storm</h3></em><br />1995's <em>The Ice Storm </em>features all sorts of drama taking place during one family's Thanksgiving weekend in 1973. There's young love, an affair, a key party, and more. Christina Ricci, Tobey Maguire, Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, and Sigourney Weaver star.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>Spider-Man</h3></em><br /><em>Spider-Man</em>? A Thanksgiving movie? That's right. In 2002's <em>Spider-Man</em> (that's the Tobey Maguire one), <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYL9aKsb4ro"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">there is a scene</a> in which Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) holds Thanksgiving dinner and Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin very menacingly prepares to carve the turkey. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>For Your Consideration </h3></em><br /><em>For Your Consideration</em> is a mockumentary about the production of a horrible-looking movie and the Oscar buzz it generates. The melodramatic movie they're making ends up being titled <em>Home for Thanksgiving</em>. You see, it's a stretch, but the Thanksgiving theme is still there. Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey, and Harry Shearer star. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>The Godfather</h3></em><br />Lastly, we have a very Thanksgiving-y movie that has absolutely nothing to do with the holiday. <em>The Godfather </em>has become a Thanksgiving movie thanks to it being <a href=""https://crimereads.com/how-the-godfather-became-an-unlikely-holiday-classic/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">played on TV all day long</a> on Turkey Day for years. This year, you can <a href=""https://www.tvguide.com/movies/the-godfather/tv-listings/124688/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">check out the marathon</a> on BBC America.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<p>As a beauty and shopping writer, I’ve spent countless hours interviewing dermatologists and estheticians, picking their brains for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dermatologist-skin-care-advice"">skincare advice</a> and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/skincare-beauty-products-stop-using-summer"">beauty products</a> they’d happily spend their hard-earned money on. Whenever I ask for recommendations on how to build an effective, no-nonsense routine, one brand comes up time and again: <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8</a>. </p>



<p>There’s a good reason why this <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">British skincare brand</a> has captured the attention of so many in-the-know experts. The brand is most beloved for its <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/crystal-retinal"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Crystal Retinal range</a>, which offers retinal (a vitamin A derivative targeting uneven skin texture and pigmentation) at various concentrations. This tailored approach allows you to find the retinoid strength that works best for your skin without irritation. Other <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8 products</a>, such as the <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/c-tetra-advanced"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">vitamin C serums</a> and <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/advanced-night-ceramide"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ceramide moisturizers</a>, are also highly rated for their efficacy.</p>



<p>Since <strong>Medik8 is currently offering <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">30% off sitewide</a> until December 2</strong>, we couldn’t help but share the bestselling products we’ll be carting up during this major <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-friday-deals"">Black Friday beauty sale</a>.</p>

<p>As someone who has sensitive skin, a product that doesn’t cause an instant uncomfortable reaction is a keeper for Susan Devaney, Refinery29’s lifestyle director.

Devaney adds, “I’m aware <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"">that retinal</a> [a form of vitamin A that’s more gentle but faster-acting than retinol] helps to keep skin in better shape by targeting hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone. I’m in my 30s, so this feels like a good investment to make for my future self. I apply SPF to my skin daily, too, which is a must when using any retinal product.” </p>

<p>Refinery29’s beauty director Jacqueline Kilikita used <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/total-moisture-daily-facial-cream"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">this moisturizer</a> down to the very last drop, and while this might not seem like an impressive feat, for a beauty editor whose job it is to try everything all at once, it says something about how excellent it is. “I love the cushiony texture that sits somewhere between a gel and a cream; it quenches my parched patches in seconds, all without leaving behind a greasy or tacky residue,” says Kilikita. The star ingredients are peptides (essentially skin-strengthening proteins), hydrating hyaluronic acid, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ceramides-skincare-eczema-dermatitis"">and ceramides</a>, which act like glue in between skin cells to keep them healthy and happy. “For me, ceramides are a must when I choose a moisturizer, especially in the winter when my skin becomes sensitive to cold weather and central heating,” adds Kilikita. Even better? It doesn’t break her out like other face creams. She’s already on her third tub. </p>

<p><a href=""https://go.linkby.com/YNQTKZRJ/products/surface-radiance-cleanse?variant=37945194479802"">This gel cleanser</a> was recommended to Refinery29’s beauty director by a dermatologist when she was going through a period of hormonal acne, and she is convinced it helped to clear up her skin. The reason it’s so great for spots is that it boasts exfoliating alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) like lactic acid and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) like salicylic acid. The former chips away at dead skin cells and minimizes the appearance of hyperpigmentation, while the latter goes a little deeper, breaking up the mixture of dead cells, oil, and dirt that clogs pores. While it sounds powerful, it’s actually very gentle and never dries out the skin thanks to a heavy helping of moisturizing glycerin. </p>

<p>Celebrity dermatologist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/drewomaukeleghe/?hl=en"">Dr. Ewoma Ukeleghe</a> once described <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/liquid-peptides"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Liquid Peptides</a> as ‘Botox in a bottle,’ and we couldn’t agree with her more. The star ingredient is a hefty 30% concentration of 10 peptides. If you’re unfamiliar with peptides, they’re essentially proteins that boost collagen and elastin — the two things responsible for keeping skin supple. Despite these powerhouse ingredients, it’s surprisingly lightweight and absorbs quickly. Apply it in the evening and wake up to bouncy skin.</p>

<p>This oil cleanser emulsifies on contact with water, turning into a silky milk that dissolves everything from multiple coats of mascara to heavy foundation and sunscreen — all without drying out your skin. That’s thanks to the mega mix of omega-6, vitamin E, and plant extracts that nourish the delicate skin barrier rather than strip it. There’s a reason beauty editors always fall back on it.</p>

<p>This isn’t your average <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/hydr8-b5"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">hyaluronic acid serum</a>. It uses multi-weight hyaluronic acid, which penetrates at different levels to ensure every layer of your skin is properly hydrated. Beyond HA, it features a solid dose of vitamin B5 (also known as panthenol) — an ingredient dermatologists praise for helping lock moisture in. Dry, dehydrated skin? Don’t know her. Better still, it never leaves skin feeling greasy or sticky.</p>

<p><a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/h-e-o-mask"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">This two-step mask</a> is a saviour for dry winter skin — just don’t let the duo of products put you off. It’s meant to be a ritual. It contains a trifecta of moisturizing ingredients: humectants, which draw moisture into the skin; occlusives, which keep it there; and emollients, which soothe and soften dry, flaky skin. Even after one use of layering the two, you’ll notice that your skin looks fresher and noticeably less parched.</p>

But sometimes the best presents  — especially if you’re shopping for a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-gifts-for-boyfriend-husband"">boyfriend, husband</a>, dad, brother, or any other <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mens-gifts"">guy in your life</a> — are the everyday upgrades that may be a bit <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cool-gifts-for-guys"">unexpected</a>, but surprisingly full of heart. So, this year, skip the gift cards and bottles of scotch because we’re serving up something much better.<br /><br />In the slides ahead, we’ve cracked the code for finding a present any man in your life will absolutely adore. The trick: He might not even know it was something he wanted or needed until you hand it to him wrapped up in a bow. If there’s one unifying factor among our gift picks this year, it’s a throughline of practicality and function with an elevated twist — think everyday utility gloves reimagined in luxe suede, or a limited-edition pair of trail runners. <br /><br />Without any further ado, we present the ultimate wish list of thoughtful gifts sure to delight and surprise any guy on your list.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.
