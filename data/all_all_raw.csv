<p>This project comprises a residence for a retired Finnish woman, situated in a former mining settlement within the Sierra Gorda of Guanajuato. <strong>Conceived as a discreet and contemplative refuge, the house occupies an irregularly shaped plot, densely populated with pirul trees, organ cacti, mesquite, prickly pears, and marked by the presence of an 18th-century mining shaft.</strong></p>",

<p>The neo-classical semi-detached house with large adjoining stable, a small wash house, and a shooting lodge was built in 1837 by master builder Joseph Anton Seger from Vaduz.

<p>The design approach seems to focus on creating a seamless integration between the interior and exterior spaces, with an emphasis on spatial fluidity and visual continuity. The elongated plan of the residence likely informed the layout, fostering a sense of openness while minimizing abrupt divisions between functional zones. The use of neutral tones for the background palette effectively establishes a restrained architectural canvas, allowing for the functional compositions to be articulated through the juxtaposition of contrasting textures, colors, and materials.</p>",

Emotional design is used to manufacture feelings that rational arguments can’t create: in other forums, both companies are talking about the speed and disruption they’re bringing, but here they use storytelling to make their technology feel human again.</p><p>This is not new, nostalgia is often used in marketing to <a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5388389"">reduce uncertainty</a><em>. </em>By tapping into the retro aesthetic or a simple get-a-coffee-and-hat hangout, what they’re trying to tell their audience is that <em>this new thing won’t hurt you</em>, ironically framing themselves as continuity of something rather than the disruptors they are aiming and claiming to be.</p><p>From a psychological perspective, this is pretty textbook — two reasons come to mind, and they’re both about how nostalgia restructures information processing.</p><h3>Schema theory</h3><p>In psychology, <a href=""https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-schema-2795873"">schema theory</a> is a cognitive framework that explains how our brain stores templates — mental blueprints, if you will — for how things usually work.</p><p>When we see or hear something new, our mind compares it to these templates to make sense of it quickly.</p><p>For example, we all have a ‘chat schema’ (type question → get response → continue conversation). When ChatGPT launched, it was easily understandable by millions partly because the interface is based on every messaging app they’ve ever used.</p><p>In design or storytelling, using familiar patterns activates existing schemas, so people understand and trust new things faster because they fit into what already feels known.</p><p>In other words, these marketing plays tap into familiar schemas to encode AI into accessible narratives. They’re not focusing on how we can use this technology to break new grounds as much as how we can embed it into what we might already be doing — whether by being a training partner or a ‘thinking cap’ for everyday problems.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot from OpenAI’s ad showing a car driving down a winding country road, with overlaid text describing a Blue Ridge Mountains road trip itinerary"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rFyN7azhUkPOO9w9AKlP4g.png"" /><figcaption>screenshot from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go4o6jiy8qE"">Road Trip with ChatGPT</a> video</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Temporal framing</strong></h3><p>Going for an 80s theme and a brick and mortar hipster hang, also triggers nostalgia in the more literal sense, and therefore a sense of comfort that can misdirect present concerns, or just inhibit (temporarily?) those thoughts on how much positive vs negative this technology has brought into society in the last couple years.</p><p>Nostalgia collapses time — the 80s don’t feel like 40 years ago, they feel like yesterday (especially to the more resistant older generation) and when the past feels close, the future feels less threatening.</p><p>This allows nostalgia to become a trust-building device that can lead even the skeptics or those on the fence to feel a spark of curiosity towards AI and therefore potentially convert them to users.</p><h3><strong>The real competition</strong></h3><p>This is where emotional design becomes competitive strategy: once nostalgia lowers our guard, emotional differentiation becomes the real battleground.</p><p>Both companies are selling functionally similar products: large language models that generate text (marginal differences do exist but arguably they’re only apparent to “power users” that may have interacted with both enough to notice those slight variation in response style or context handling). And in this case, making us feel something about one product or the other, becomes the differentiator instead of any demonstrable superiority.</p><p>OpenAI’s 80s nostalgia and Anthropic’s hipster warmth create distinct emotional profiles that different people might resonate with, but neither corresponds to actual measurable product advantage.</p><p>Whether either campaign addresses actual user needs or showcases the real benefit of this tech is debatable, but then again AI is such an “abstract” concept for most that how do you really condense it down in a 30 second ad or how do you make an event out of it where people just show up?</p><figure><img alt=""Venn diagram showing three overlapping circles labeled Visceral, Behavioural, and Reflective.

These campaigns show that emotional design isn’t always simply about delight but it can guide trust calibration too.

To make sense of it, we first internalize the medium.</p><p><strong>An interface, then, is a cognitive framework.</strong></p><p>Today, AI interfaces are shifting fast: from chat to voice, from canvases to agent-driven cross-tool spaces. As models converge in capability, the real differentiation has moved to the interface layer. The interface is no longer just a channel. It is the key that unlocks technology, translating complexity into affordances and shaping the flow of human attention.</p><h3>The collapse of interaction</h3><p>Before large language models, our typical path to finding answers online looked something like this: break your question down into keywords (like pizza, recipe, tutorial) and feed them to a search engine.</p><p>Then you wade through a long list of results, browsing page by page, clicking on a few promising links to read carefully, and finally mentally stitching those fragments together into your own version of the answer.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram comparing command-based, process-driven, and AI-driven intent-based interfaces through Google and Perplexity examples."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-VaSvfujeqbYtSkUzrczRQ.png"" /></figure><p>In contrast, with conversational AI products, I simply say: “Give me the perfect pizza recipe and instructions,” and the AI immediately serves up a curated answer. If it’s not quite right, I add a couple more sentences, the AI continues to refine or rewrite, and soon I’ve iterated to a final answer.</p><p>So with AI’s intervention, we can see two major shifts in product interaction paradigms:</p><h4><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-paradigm/"">From command-based to intent-based</a></h4><p>Traditional interfaces relied on a turn-taking loop: <strong>input → output → user judgment → next command.</strong> Now, instead of issuing step-by-step instructions, the user states the goal, and the system handles the process behind the scenes.</p><h4>From process-driven to outcome-driven</h4><p>Interaction used to feel like a visible journey, where users accumulated knowledge and built judgment along the way. Today, much of that process is folded into the backend. Interaction becomes a cycle of prompting and refining around the result itself. The user’s main task is to evaluate the output, while the system dynamically connects the dots based on intent.</p><h3>The unmoored chat box</h3><p>Interestingly, most AI products have converged on the same choice: a chat box. The reason is obvious — chat feels natural, with virtually zero learning curve. Prompts unfold as back-and-forth conversation, offering high interactivity, tolerance for errors, low barriers to entry, and almost unlimited flexibility. It’s the perfect vehicle for mass adoption.</p><figure><img alt=""Grid showing six AI chat interfaces, including ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, DeepSeek, and Grok, all sharing similar layouts."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Uyp3cUr0RbKUIwfIUOBUoQ.png"" /></figure><p>This is why Sam Altman wants to build ChatGPT into a <a href=""https://youtu.be/ctcMA6chfDY?si=WLb9A244XcdJmTnT"">Personal Life OS</a>. In that value narrative, the experiential intuitiveness and multimodal extensibility of conversational interaction is the solution for vast life scenarios.</p><p>But there’s another, less visible factor: LLMs are inherently <a href=""https://maggieappleton.com/squish-structure"">squishy</a>. The same intent, placed in slightly different contexts, can produce different results. Therefore, ensuring that a setting always corresponds to stable, reproducible effects is a thankless task.</p><p>As a result, AI products often bury parameters deep in the system instead of exposing them as explicit controls.</p><figure><img alt=""Composite interface mockup showing an AI tool presenting maps, videos, product listings, and charts in one unified workspace."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aNaUD3ArHvj-QxGZJuMiOw.png"" /></figure><p>Take ChatGPT as an example. Beyond plain text, it can also produce tables, images, charts, code snippets, videos, and content cards.</p><p>One way to unlock these formats is to be explicit in the prompt — say, asking the AI to present the answer as a flowchart. But this puts the burden back on the user, who now has to master structured prompting and understand how content should align with different formats.</p><p>The second is to let the AI decide, having the system choose the appropriate presentation based on the generated content’s characteristics. This points to a major trend in future interfaces — <a href=""https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/generative-user-interfaces?_sm_vck=J8qN47SpWnMDrN8LSrDW9NkMQHB0Q8RH7DJrRRslW9447Q7sqsRN"">Generative UI</a>.</p><p>In this model, AI doesn’t just generate content, it simultaneously decides and renders the most fitting presentation container, truly merging output with interface for genuine personalization.</p><p>But before Generative UI becomes reality, the chat box stays out of control.</p><h3>Category error</h3><p>Dave Edwards, founder of <a href=""https://artificialityinstitute.org/"">Artificiality</a>, offered a thought-provoking <a href=""https://artificialityinstitute.org/the-design-illusion-of-llms/"">metaphor</a> that most digital products fall into one of two categories:</p><p><strong>Windows</strong>: they connect users to external information and resources — think Tripadvisor, Airbnb, or Spotify.</p><p><strong>Rooms</strong>: they provide spaces for work, collaboration, and creation — tools like Figma, Photoshop, or PowerPoint.</p><figure><img alt=""Comparison between Figma and Tripadvisor interfaces illustrating two tool metaphors: “room” for exploration and “window” for creation."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nU3L_X_hnCmYOBNsZIHJmA.png"" /></figure><p>If we map AI users along a proficiency spectrum: there are beginners, intermediate users, and power users.</p><p>Conversational interfaces naturally cater to the first two groups.

On the other hand, we’re experiencing an advent of conversational experiences that seem to be ballooning in presence and variation.</p><p>What perplexes me is that nearly every AI thing is interacted with via conversation of some kind. But while some versions of conversational experiences have been disparaged — <em>why are we so willing to accept and try out others? What’s happening right now psychologically where humans are both actively adopting and accepting certain conversational experiences and hating others at the same time?</em></p><p>So I began my journey down the research rabbit hole.</p><figure><img alt=""Marketing image of the Pet Rock product."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/610/1*Nol8M4iuTSU1lN1OZt5F1g.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Creator: Al Freni | Credit: The LIFE Images Collection/Getty</figcaption></figure><h3>Willingness: The initial mindset</h3><p>The novelty of something <a href=""https://medium.com/@nickannora/why-people-love-ai-quite-literally-5cdb8e9804c8"">new is exciting for most folks</a> — I get that. And to be fair, Chatbots in their more traditional form have been with us for some time. My assumption here was that <em>traditional Chatbots have notoriously built up a bad reputation over time</em>. But, as with any assumption, I knew I needed to <strong>dig deeper</strong>. I started with attempting to investigate our <strong>willingness</strong>.</p><p>My research began to reveal that humans are generally willing to try AI experiences, and even more broadly — new technology — for a <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2022.101925"">combination of reasons</a>, including <strong>perceived usefulness, efficiency, enjoyment</strong>, and a natural human inclination to <strong>experiment with shiny new things</strong>.</p><p>To summarize, here are some of the key reasons and ideas I encountered as to why humans are more likely willing to try newer technologies, especially AI:</p><ul><li><strong>Novelty and curiosity: </strong>Humans are often drawn to new technologies and the potential they hold for progress and improvement.</li><li><strong>Social influence: </strong>Observing others adopting and benefiting from AI can encourage further exploration and acceptance.</li><li><strong>Efficiency and automation: </strong>AI can automate mundane and repetitive tasks, freeing up human time and energy for more complex or enjoyable activities.</li><li><strong>Enhanced capabilities: </strong>AI can perform tasks that humans find difficult or time-consuming, such as processing large datasets, identifying complex patterns, and generating new content.</li><li><strong>Improved experiences: </strong>AI can personalize interactions, provide targeted recommendations, and offer convenient, 24/7 support in areas like customer service and digital assistance.</li></ul><p>The concept of <strong>Social influence</strong> makes total sense to me — humans have historically relied on <strong>word-of-mouth</strong> to inform their decision making processes. AI is no different — we’re currently bombarded with personal stories from colleagues, friends and family of how they’re using AI.</p><p>Thinking about additional key concepts, <strong>efficiency</strong> and <strong>automation</strong> are the big promises of AI. And also where some of the fears stem from — <em>imagine seeing your skillsets automated leaving you effectively redundant</em>.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of the “summarize” feature now available within Google Docs"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QglxnrKk0V_Kre9fFncncA.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot of the “summarize” feature now available within Google Docs</figcaption></figure><p>Conceptually, both <strong>Enhanced Capabilities</strong> and <strong>Improved Experiences</strong> are showing up within existing software experiences more and more every day. Things like Google’s AI-enhanced search results or any of the “synthesis” capabilities being folded into nearly every product — <em>“help me write”</em> or <em>“summarize this”</em> types of patterns are quickly becoming commonplace.</p><p>What will be interesting across all of these is <strong>what sticks</strong>. I think many of us would agree we’re currently in a technological bubble. So out of these <strong>enhancements, improvements</strong> and <strong>novelties</strong> — <em>what will become consistently useful?</em></p><p>I believe surviving conversational experiences will continue to fall into either of the following categories. Some of these examples will be more like Latent Needs as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jmspool_driving-innovation-from-your-customers-activity-7363238346925481985-SQbB/"">Jared Spool</a> describes — akin to a heated steering wheel. In other words,</p><blockquote>“I didn’t know I needed this — but now that I have it…”</blockquote><p>Other example solutions will aim to solve existing problems facing human users. And the rest will become a casualty of the bubble as the <strong>novelty wears off</strong> and usefulness doesn’t persist.</p><p>At a high-level, it seems like it’s a suite of potential things that lead us to a place of willingness — <strong>the novelty of something new, the influence that both our peers and media have on us</strong> and of course — <strong>the promise of better</strong>.</p><h3>Acceptance</h3><p>I realize following a meandering path like this can be difficult — so I’ll try to keep us tethered. Remembering where I started at the beginning of this rabbit hole, I asked <em>why might we be willing to use an AI-driven conversational interface as compared to the classic Chatbots many of us distaste</em>. As I dug into the concept of willingness, I often encountered <strong>acceptance</strong> as a nearby, if not similar concept.</p><p>The primary distinction between acceptance and the previous one is that <strong>willingness is a short-term, initial mindset</strong>, while <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585322001587"">acceptance</a> describes the <strong>sustained, actual use of a product over time</strong>, reflecting <strong>deeper integration</strong> and <strong>satisfaction</strong>. So now that I understand the promise of the new a bit better, <em>what about this sustained relationship?</em></p><blockquote><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585322001587""><strong>Acceptance</strong></a> is primarily defined as the behavioral intention or willingness to use, buy, or try a good or service.</blockquote><p>It is a critical factor for the successful adoption and uptake of new technologies, particularly Artificial Intelligence. Low acceptance can lead to the <strong>disuse of resources, a surplus of unused devices</strong>, and a <strong>slowdown in technological innovation</strong>.</p><p>The research continued to portray how acceptance can be a conscious, personal choice, such as <strong>knowingly purchasing a device that contains AI</strong>, or it can also be an involuntary action, like <strong>unknowingly interacting with an AI chatbot</strong> that presents itself as a human customer service agent.</p><figure><img alt=""A swiss army style pocket knife — meant to highlight aspects of acceptance, such as perceived usefulness."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OMT3e9UHYHGDpiS0B1v_Jw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>image credit: Photo by<a href=""https://unsplash.com/@vjgalaxy?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash""> Alejandro Piñero Amerio</a> on<a href=""https://unsplash.com/photos/brown-and-silver-safety-pin-LHFuqK3KywE?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash""> Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>The <strong>key psychosocial factors </strong>that consistently predict a user’s acceptance of AI across various industries closely resembles willingness but with some variance towards perspective over time:</p><ul><li><strong>Perceived Usefulness / Performance Expectancy:</strong> This is the degree to which a person believes that using a particular technology will help them achieve their goals or be useful in their daily life. It is often the strongest positive predictor of the intention to use a new technology.</li><li><strong>Perceived Ease of Use / Effort Expectancy:</strong> This refers to a user’s perception of how effortless a technology would be to use. Its influence can be weaker than perceived usefulness, especially as users become more familiar with technology in general.</li><li><strong>Attitudes: </strong>A person’s attitude towards a technology is a frequently included variable that positively predicts their behavioral intention to use it.</li><li><strong>Trust:</strong> This is the subjective attitude that allows a person to make a vulnerable decision, believing that a technology will achieve a desired goal. You can really start to see some symbiosis here — <em>Trust in both the AI and its provider is a significant driving factor in acceptance</em>.</li><li><strong>Social Influence / Subjective Norms:</strong> This factor involves a person’s perception that significant others would approve or disapprove of their use of the technology. It is particularly relevant in industries with high levels of social contact.</li></ul><h4>Models for Assessing Acceptance</h4><p>To understand and measure acceptance, I came across several <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585322001587"">research-theoretical models</a>, and how they’ve been adapted specifically for contexts like AI.</p><ul><li><strong>Technology Acceptance Model</strong>: This is the most frequently used and flexible model for assessing technology acceptance. It posits that Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use are the primary drivers of a user’s intention to use a technology.</li><li><strong>Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology</strong>: This model integrates concepts from eight other theories, including TAM — Technology Acceptance Model. It suggests that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions predict behavioral intentions and usage.</li><li><strong>AI Device Use Acceptance model</strong>: A more recent model developed specifically for AI, the AIDUA model proposes that users appraise AI devices in stages based on factors like social influence, hedonic motivation (perceived pleasure), and anthropomorphism (human-like qualities).</li></ul><p>What I’ve found so far is that these psychological factors all seemingly overlap and interrelate. Willingness correlates to the novelty and promise of something new, while Acceptance speaks to how our expectations are met over time. I can start to see how these pieces fit together in perhaps a larger adoption journey.</p><blockquote>The perceived promise gets folks through the doors and consistent outcomes matching expectations keeps them coming back.</blockquote><p>Whew, here we are in the rabbit hole. I still feel like there’s more to understand about sustained use and what individual facets can help drive acceptance. <em>What is it that makes us hesitant instead of willing as the conversational space in software continues to evolve? What brings us back over and over again?</em></p><figure><img alt=""Modern depiction of Microsoft’s classic virtual assistant — Clippy"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pcYGzNmQglINPNRwxVgYBA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>image credit: Microsoft <a href=""https://news.microsoft.com/pt-br/aproveite-a-nostalgia-com-os-novos-planos-de-fundo-do-microsoft-teams/"">https://news.microsoft.com/pt-br/aproveite-a-nostalgia-com-os-novos-planos-de-fundo-do-microsoft-teams/</a></figcaption></figure><p>My curiosity led me in <strong>deeper</strong>. My hypothesis at this point was taking shape around this intersection of <strong>humans and how or why they might trust software</strong>. I’ve personally become distrustful of classic Chatbots. If it even looks like the Chatbot of yesterday — seeing something like a Floating Action Button yielding a Clippy-like offering, promising to answer all my questions — <em>I’m immediately prepared to never touch it</em>.</p><h3>Trust… actually Search first</h3><p>Before I head into why and how trust is earned and eroded, I started by investigating perhaps the precursor of today’s conversational experience — <strong>Search.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""A retro screenshot of Google’s homepage from circa 1998"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/502/1*zYMJwuoUOXS0ROQg6-cODw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Google Beta homepage (1998) Source: <a href=""https://www.india.com/buzz/happy-birthday-google-7-things-unheard-about-search-engine-giant-as-it-greets-self-with-doodle-on-16th-anniversary-159143"">India.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>Traditional search experiences are of course now being woven together with AI intelligence. Outside of that, you can still see and sense the same disparity in appreciation of search experiences akin to classic Chatbots and modern Conversational Experiences. Some search experiences are highly utilized and accepted and others are not. Putting allegiances aside, I was curious about how existing with Search as a paradigm and evolving with it all these years <strong>could have potentially influenced us</strong> as we are redirected into more conversational interfaces.</p><p>Through observations with some early conversational interfaces I’ve been working on, I noted that <strong>users are still mostly beginning their conversation with succinctly few words, if not only one word</strong> — <em>why?</em></p><p><a href=""https://www.emerald.com/ajim/article-abstract/73/3/436/50198/The-effects-of-cognitive-load-on-query?redirectedFrom=fulltext"">Research</a> revealed that users may start their searches with one word primarily due to the initial cognitive load and the iterative nature of search. I’d include familiarity as well, since search has been taking shape beside us for years now.</p><p>Explanations include:</p><ul><li><strong>Reducing cognitive load: </strong>Starting with a single term requires little effort. Users can quickly generate results and then adapt their query based on what they see.</li><li><strong>Iterative process: </strong>Search is often exploratory. A single keyword acts as a starting point, giving users something to refine as they go.</li><li><strong>System familiarity: </strong>Decades of exposure to search engines have trained users to trust that even minimal input will trigger auto-suggestions or relevant results.</li></ul><p>Interestingly, while iterative searching does happen, only <a href=""https://backlinko.com/google-user-behavior#only-15-of-google-users-modify-their-initial-search-term""><strong>15% of Google searches are refined or modified</strong></a>. This suggests to me that modern search engines are highly performant in that users often find satisfactory answers from their first attempt. Over time, this reliability has created a strong expectation that <em>“search just works,”</em> reinforcing user trust and shaping behavior.</p><blockquote>Subsequently, certain search experiences and approaches have evolved with us and adapted to us to become highly effective.</blockquote><p>In contrast — when currently working with an AI experience, users often <strong>feel as though they’re at fault for not achieving the outcome they’d hoped for</strong>. <em>“It’s my fault I can’t get this AI to do what I want!”</em> We should work to eliminate the returning concept of “User Error”.</p><p>This led me to some new questions:</p><ul><li><em>How does the trust that users have with traditional search transfer (or fail to transfer) to conversational AI?</em></li><li><em>What design patterns might we use to help conversational AI feel as reliable and effortless as traditional search?</em></li></ul><figure><img alt=""Human hand shaking a digital looking hand"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/958/1*nMkfMDMrNPMDzT2akbVo1A.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Image credit: Adobe Stock</figcaption></figure><h3>Back to Trust</h3><p>As seen with the evolution of Search — it took time to reach a point where users rely on the pattern, usually without question. I personally feel very confident currently that I can input very little into a Google Search and then with the predictive suggestions, presentation of results and likely summary-answers — <em>I’ll get what I’m looking for quickly and easily.</em></p><p>Unlike usability, which is <strong>immediately noticeable when something feels difficult or frustrating</strong>, <a href=""https://articles.ux-primer.com/how-ux-design-influences-the-way-users-trust-or-doubt-technology-28e6e8ca3596"">trust operates subtly</a> in the background.</p><blockquote>Trust is built in small moments of reassurance and consistency, and it can be lost in a single misstep.</blockquote><p>My journey across this research continued to affirm some things about trust. For example, in UX it isn’t just about security — it’s about <strong>predictability and transparency</strong>. Users trust products that behave in expected ways, where actions lead to anticipated outcomes. But trust doesn’t just matter at the beginning of an interaction; it needs to be <strong>reinforced throughout the user journey</strong>.</p><p>While the conceptual space surrounding how humans develop a trusting relationship with software experience is vast, here are a few notable concepts I can quickly summarize:</p><ul><li>One of the most powerful factors influencing trust is <a href=""https://www.psandman.com/col/familiarity.htm#:~:text=The%20basic%20principle%20in%20a,in%20which%20it%20is%20familiar).""><strong>familiarity bias</strong></a> — the tendency for people to trust what feels familiar.</li><li>Another key principle is <strong>cognitive fluency</strong>, which refers to how easily information is processed.</li><li><strong>First impressions</strong> also shape <a href=""https://articles.ux-primer.com/how-ux-design-influences-the-way-users-trust-or-doubt-technology-28e6e8ca3596"">long-term perceptions</a> of trustworthiness. Research in psychology shows that <strong>people form lasting opinions within milliseconds of encountering a website or app</strong>.</li></ul><blockquote>This is where our willingness is gambled away as our anticipated outcomes aren’t realized and we’re left disappointed.</blockquote><ul><li>Another psychological factor is <strong>ambiguity aversion</strong> — the <a href=""https://www.kommunicate.io/blog/ai-chatbot-fears/#:~:text=5.%20Companies%20Not%20Caring%20Another%20common%20concern,a%20cold%20and%20impersonal%20customer%20service%20experience."">natural discomfort people feel when outcomes are unclear</a>. If users aren’t sure what happens when they click a button, whether their payment went through, or how their data will be used, they experience hesitation. This seems like a facet of why many of us have grown negative towards traditional Chatbots — <em>I know personally I’m never sure how versatile or capable they might be.</em></li><li><a href=""https://articles.ux-primer.com/how-ux-design-influences-the-way-users-trust-or-doubt-technology-28e6e8ca3596""><strong>Emotional reassurance</strong></a><strong> </strong>also influences trust. Users feel more confident when an interface acknowledges their concerns, provides timely feedback, and offers clear pathways forward.</li><li><a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/how-is-trust-and-credibility-designed-in-ux-fc0ed84a1697""><strong>Social proof</strong></a> is a psychological phenomenon where people conform to the actions of others under the assumption that those actions are indicative of the correct behavior. In UX, social proof can be leveraged to enhance trust through elements like reviews, testimonials, or user counts. Antithesis of this is Dark Patterns. Interestingly, this seems to correlate back to Social Influence in how we might adopt and accept software.</li></ul><p>The answer to my initial question feels like its starting to take shape. Trust is clearly a big reason that some of us humans have become weary of traditional Chatbots and poor search experiences. We’ve been left stuck in ambiguity — <em>“are you able to actually answer my question?”</em> and then we’re subsequently and consistently disappointed with the quality of answer or help we sought.</p><figure><img alt=""A toy robot set in a dark background"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y4pTs1cuqsd0hICZlSTH9g.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=""https://unsplash.com/@jochenvw?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"">Jochen van Wylick</a> on <a href=""https://unsplash.com/photos/yellow-and-black-robot-toy-Y40Ga3oahAs?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Novelty, Risk &amp; Familiarity</h3><p>The research so far has shown how novelty can draw users to AI and new technological experiences. I found myself wondering if the <strong>relationship between novelty and willingness in this context were actually balanced</strong>. I quickly dug into how humans perceive risk around something new and novel to try and answer my new question.</p><p>According to my research, instead of a balance between novelty and willingness, <strong>the opposite is often true</strong>: <em>novelty can increase </em><a href=""https://www.psandman.com/col/familiarity.htm#:~:text=The%20basic%20principle%20in%20a,in%20which%20it%20is%20familiar).""><em>perceived risk and trigger risk-averse behavior</em></a>.</p><p>Here’s why:</p><ul><li><strong>Uncertainty and lack of information:</strong> Novelty inherently involves uncertainty, as the outcomes and potential risks of something new are not well-known or tested. This lack of information can be perceived as risky, prompting individuals to be cautious or avoid it altogether. This idea tends to be represented by a certain percentage of folks out there — still feeling hesitant or fearful of AI in general.</li><li><strong>Unfamiliarity:</strong> Humans tend to be more wary of the unknown. A lack of familiarity with something new can heighten feelings of vulnerability or potential harm, leading to risk aversion.</li><li><strong>Potential for negative consequences:</strong> Without prior experience, the potential for negative consequences with something new is often emphasized.

You weren’t just searching for information, you were learning how to judge it.</em></p><p><em>Now the answer shows up at the top.</em></p><p><em>We don’t navigate information anymore. <br /></em><strong><em>We negotiate truth.</em></strong></p><p><em>And like any negotiation, the outcome doesn’t just depend on what is said.

It’s on </em></strong><a href=""https://www.fadedpage.com/sc/innis.php""><strong><em>Harold Innis</em></strong></a><em> and how his forgotten idea about media bias can help us understand why search has become a negotiation for truth.</em></p><h3>How delivery shapes belief</h3><p>In the mid-1900s, Harold Innis was studying why some forms of knowledge last a long time and others disappear quickly. His answer: <a href=""https://www.newcartographies.com/p/harold-innis-and-our-time"">the way information is delivered carries a bias.</a></p><p>What he called <a href=""https://www.media-studies.ca/articles/innis.htm"">media bias</a> wasn’t what you would think of as being political. Instead, this was structural. Every medium (or delivery method) tilts truth in a particular direction. Innis divided this communication into two types:</p><ul><li><strong>Time-biased media</strong> like stone tablets, clay, and oral tradition: durable, slow to produce, hard to distribute. Designed to preserve memory across generations. <br />They were costly to create, so what made it into stone was meant to last.</li><li><strong>Space-biased media</strong> like paper, newspapers and radio: fast, scalable, and easy to spread. Great for moving information across distance. The tradeoff is that the information is easy to forget.</li></ul><p>Each method has different consequences if you’re wrong. You definitely don’t want to carve a mistake in stone. But you’ll toss an opinion on the radio without much hesitation.</p><p>Innis believed civilizations leans one way or the other. The problem is when they lean too far, things start to crack. For instance, the more a culture chases speed, the more it sacrifices memory.</p><p>That worried him, because when speed becomes the goal, friction disappears. And when friction disappears, belief forms too easily.</p><p>When that happens, people start believing things without remembering why. Information flies everywhere, and everyone believes a little bit of everything, but nothing deeply enough to sustain conviction, trust, or memory.</p><p>Which brings us to the delivery method shaping a lot of decisions today: the <strong>answer engine</strong>.</p><h3>The frictionless answer</h3><p>Innis taught that every medium tilts truth by setting the cost of being wrong (back to the idea that stone carried a level of permanence).</p><p><strong>Answer engines flipped that equation.</strong> They’re fast, free, available and project absolute confidence… while carrying almost zero accountability.</p><p>That’s the bias of the delivery system we live with now: <strong>it produces answers that <em>look </em>like truth but are endlessly changeable.</strong></p><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>That mismatch matters. It’s not just a technology problem, and it’s deeply philosophical.</p><h3>Truth as a system</h3><p>Truth has always carried signals about how seriously to take it. I think about how headlines hint at urgency or a broadcast voice carries authority. Even a blog post tells you something about the author behind it.</p><p>Answer engines strip that information away. What’s left is a paragraph that’s floating above information that is constantly shifting around.</p><p>That’s why I think <strong>negotiation</strong> is the right metaphor. We aren’t testing competing claims anymore. We’re reacting to how the system delivers them. If it looks fine, we believe it.</p><p>Innis understood that the way information is delivered is more important than the content. It sets the probability of belief.</p><p>When answers are this easy to generate, its the delivery method that convinces us, not the accuracy of the information. Over time, we stop asking whether something is true and start assuming it must be… because it looked complete when it showed up.</p><h3>The context problem</h3><p>So we arrive at the issue brands are <em>actually</em> facing.</p><p>Brands assume the challenge is volume. Publish more, post more… rank more. But the challenge isn’t content. <strong>It’s context.</strong></p><p>Most brands are still playing an old game… chasing backlinks, tweaking keywords, and pumping out pages to satisfy algorithms that ranked links instead of resolving questions.</p><p>That used to work… when brands controlled the narrative. When it paid to write carefully sanitized copy that sounded official, without saying anything useful. When brands do that now, they don’t look like they’re being careful. They look evasive.</p><p>But now that same content gets torn apart, summarized, and served out of context.</p><p>This is an answer-first world. You can be right and still not be trusted.</p><p>That’s another paradox: <strong>trust now lives even further downstream from your content. It’s perceived by the reader only after they’ve read what the answer engine tore apart.</strong></p><h3>What we build from here</h3><p>If search is now a negotiation, brands can’t keep showing up the old way.</p><p>Publishing more just to publish more doesn’t make brands more believable. (You can look at stats on your content if you don’t believe me.)</p><p>Instead, I think brands need to work on understanding customer friction, offering context, and helping people weigh what to believe… even when the answer isn’t perfect. <strong>That’s how you build trust with your customer.</strong></p><p>Take financial services (where I spend my time).</p><p>Most banks write content to align with their own products and services. But answer engines aren’t asking what helps the brand. They’re asking what helps the reader.</p><p>So if you’re writing a piece called “What should Gen Z do with their tax return?”, and every answer just funnels them toward your checking account, you’ve already lost. Not because your product is bad… but because your answer wasn’t complete.</p><p>I think this will be the difference. Some will try to control the story and shape the narrative, while the winners will help people understand their options — even if one of them doesn’t benefit them directly.</p><p>Harold Innis warned us: When speed becomes the goal, memory becomes a casualty<em>. </em>Answer engines are fast, but if they erase the process of belief-building, trust doesn’t scale with them.</p><p>The organizations that adapt will realize that truth isn’t something you publish once and forget. It’s something you shape, over and over, in the ways your words and products survive being summarized.</p><p>In the long run, what people believe isn’t decided by what ranked. It’s decided by what <em>held up</em>.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ad3ea06886b2"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/negotiating-truth-ad3ea06886b2"">Negotiating truth</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Design management is harder (and better) than I thought</h4><figure><img alt=""A hand-drawn diagram of x’s and o’s with lines and arrows pointing out various movements."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wFclA7SgV_V8vIyc0aH4fQ.png"" /></figure><p>I’ve been a design manager since 2022. Like many others in this role, I’ve been slowly shaping and reshaping my management values. This is where I’m at now. I’ll likely update this over time, or do a part 2.</p><p>I was an individual contributor (IC) for over 20 years before moving into management. Even then, I was reluctant to take the job because I enjoyed doing the work so much. So I’m familiar with ICs, how they think, and what sorts of things they think about. Things like craft, product quality, three-month timelines, career development, and recognition.</p><p>Now that I’ve been in management for a while, I also see how leadership thinks too. They’re thinking about strategy, year-long roadmaps, revenue, and the overall health of the organization.</p><p>I have a foot in both worlds, which will be a common thread in this article. I can help ICs think a little more strategically, and I can help leaders stay closer to the work.</p><p>Whether or not “manager” is in my title, I try to be that bridge, and to help everyone around me get just a little bit better.</p><h3>It all starts with team health</h3><p>No one does their best work when they’re stressed, burned out, or afraid to speak up. Great collaboration comes from trust and honest feedback that never feels personal or belittling.</p><p>I try to build that culture:</p><ul><li>Giving people both async and live ways to contribute, so it’s not just the loudest voice or one in an optimal timezone that wins.</li><li>Making it normal to share work early, not just when someone “feels it’s ready for critique.” We’re going to get leadership’s feedback at some point, better to get it early when there’s still time to address it and possibly change direction.</li><li>Being realistic about bandwidth and not overcommitting folks. I sometimes have to talk someone out of saying “yes” to something when they don’t realistically have time for it.</li><li>Encouraging experimentation and making room for failure as folks drift into adjacent roles. Especially now as research, design, product, and engineering move closer together.</li><li>Being vulnerable myself: sharing a past failure with the team, saying “I don’t know the answer”, or admitting when I’m struggling.</li></ul><p>With a healthy team culture, everything else gets easier.</p><h3>Player coach</h3><p>Some managers are comfortable not doing design anymore. Not me. I prefer being a player-coach, coaching the team and still doing some actual design work myself.</p><p>Most of the leaders I respect are close to the craft. Especially now, when AI enables everyone to build more, there’s less room for people who don’t actually do the work. I spend about equal time between people problems and craft problems.</p><p>I need real knowledge of the craft to be a useful thought partner. If I drift too far from the work, I stop speaking the same language as my ICs. I miss the little details that matter. Without that context, my input feels generic and surface-level.</p><p>Being good at the people side helps me move projects forward by unblocking decisions, aligning folks around a goal, and building momentum.</p><p>Getting better at the craft makes meme better at the work itself. The product experience, along with its complexity and details. The thing customers actually experience.</p><p><strong>You need both to lead well.</strong></p><p>That said, I’m mindful not to take on any large or “critical path” projects. My design contributions usually involve things like designing small features, covering a project when a designer is on PTO, bug fixes and polish, taking “busy work” from my ICs, and starting larger vision work to hand off to someone else.</p><p>This keeps me hands-on, but not in the way. That balance is important for me. That balance is important for me.</p><h3>Delegation is a sliding scale</h3><p>Delegation is often treated like a light switch. You either do the work yourself or you hand it off completely. In reality, it’s more of a sliding scale.</p><p>Sometimes you take on the task yourself. Sometimes you work alongside someone. Other times, you let them run with it. The right approach depends on the situation, their experience, and how much I want to check in along the way.</p><p>For example, I stay involved in the day-to-day of important projects. For smaller ones, I might delegate fully and just say, “Let me know how it turns out” or “Holler if you need anything from me.”</p><p>It’s less about rules and more about knowing my team.</p><h3>Avoid becoming a bottleneck</h3><blockquote><em>You may be lying to yourself when you say, “I’m the only one who can do this”. — </em><a href=""https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/how-to-delegate-with-high-standards""><em>Wes Kao</em></a></blockquote><p>Wes’s quote stuck with me because I’ve caught myself doing exactly that. In the past, I’ve been guilty of “hiding” in the work I’m already good at, keeping it from others. I tell myself no one else can do X, but deep down it’s also pride in being the one who does it well.</p><p>It’s important to be honest and call myself out in situations like this.</p><p>There are going to be new things that are ambiguous and uncertain, and it’s going to feel tempting to delay thinking about those and focusing on what I know. There will always be too much on my plate. The job is to decide where I’ll have the most impact, usually not by falling back on what I’m already good at. That might mean passing on a design review I’d normally jump into so I can focus on a hiring decision instead.</p><p>An example is HTML email: Every job I’ve had in the last 10 years, I’ve been known as “the email guy” who knows how to code HTML emails. That may be true when I first join, but I make sure to document what I know so others can help themselves. As an example, I created an email design system during my time at Stack Overflow so each product team could build their own emails without being email experts.</p><p>Another example is design feedback. I can’t review everything in real-time, and I don’t want that to slow my team down. So I documented what I look for: my taste, established UX conventions, our design system, and the comments I repeat most often, and made a custom GPT for my team to use. I even added some of my boss’s feedback style.</p><p>The goal isn’t always to <em>replace</em> me, but to help my team go farther without me.</p><h3>Clearing the path</h3><p>A big part of my job is helping my team <a href=""https://jordivillar.com/blog/becoming-irrelevant"">focus</a> on the work that matters most. That means filtering out noise before it ever reaches them. Not every request deserves their attention. I’d rather say no early than let distractions pile up. Pushing back is not always comfortable, but protecting the team’s focus is part of my role.</p><p>I also spend time clearing fog. Ambiguity slows people down. By sharpening the problem, setting constraints, or filling in missing context, I can help the team move faster and make better decisions.</p><p>And then there’s tension. Between what leadership wants, what the team needs, and what the product should become. I absorb that tension so my team doesn’t have to. That might mean telling leadership we need to slow down, or explaining to the team why priorities just shifted.</p><p>The team gets the clarity. I carry the weight.</p><h3>Just enough process</h3><p>Process helps teams stay on track, but too much of it kills creativity and momentum. When checkpoints and approvals pile up, the work starts to feel like factory output. I’ve seen projects where the design review process added more overhead than the design itself. No bueno.</p><p>My goal is to have enough structure to guide the work, but allows detours along the way for folks to find the right solution. Like prototyping an unexpected idea.</p><p>I teach designers to use their own judgment so they need me less for permission and more for refinement. Figma’s Jonas Downey has <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/how-to-build-a-resilient-design-team/#_5-be-judicious-about-process"">a few great prompts</a> to get designers thinking:</p><ul><li>What would you decide if it was fully up to you?</li><li>How would you explain this to a user?</li><li>How does it support our business?</li><li>How could we simplify it?</li></ul><p>I love using these in design reviews to get the discussion going when the group is quiet, and they always spark better conversations than another checklist would. These nudge people toward clearer, stronger work without adding more process.</p><h3>The manager’s quiet kind of high</h3><p>I’ve made peace with not getting that <a href=""https://jamie.ideasasylum.com/2024/06/21/the-manager-s-unbearable-lack-of-endorphins"">daily high</a> from making something with my own hands. I get satisfaction from watching my team build great stuff and grow personally, and knowing I played a part in it.</p><p>There’s power in those indirect wins:</p><ul><li>Clearing the path so someone can ship something they’re proud of.</li><li>Coaching someone today so their work months from now is stronger.</li><li>Rejecting the urgent-but-low-impact so the team can focus on what matters.</li></ul><p>Like when a designer nails their review with leadership, a coworker compliments one of my reports, or our work moves an important metric.</p><p>These moments aren’t always loud or concrete, so I keep a section for them in <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/why-you-should-have-a-brag-document-eb6cc82ec80a"">my brag document</a> so I don’t forget about my wins as a manager.</p><h3>Don’t forget who you are</h3><p>Design work is tough, even in the best conditions. As a manager, one of the things I enjoy most is finding ways to take pressure off the team when things get especially stressful.</p><p>I still upload unhinged custom emojis to company chat, host silly birthday games over Zoom, and drop funny links in chat.</p><figure><img alt=""A series of smiley face emojis with various expressions, all wearing a cowboy hat."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*L3MUzg4miqJ01Y1pNGNffQ.png"" /><figcaption>Cowboy emojis, a tradition started by <a href=""https://www.aaronshekey.com/posts/custom-emojis/"">a former co-worker</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m mindful of what I say publicly because I realize the weight my words and actions carry as a leader in the company. But it’s important to lighten the mood once in a while That spirit finds its way back into the work and helps people feel psychologically safe.</p><h3>Everyday is winding road</h3><p>Like I said earlier, I’m still learning and my thoughts are evolving. I’m not a seasoned pro, but after a few years in management I’ve learned a few things worth sharing. I’m pressing publish now… curious to see how this will read a year from today.</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p><p><a href=""https://www.tedgoas.com/newsletter/""><em>Subscribe to my newsletter</em></a><em> to get more bit-sized thoughts on product design, email, and climate tech.</em></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=7c998c017602"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/management-values-i-didnt-expect-to-learn-7c998c017602"">Management values I didn’t expect to learn</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<p>Get whisked away from mundane days and adult responsibilities, even if just for a moment, with the upcoming <a href=""https://www.gap.com/browse/info.do?cid=3044135&amp;mlink=5058,1,HP_MERCH_BANNER_Sandy_C_CH_ExploreGapX"">Gap x Sandy Liang collaboration</a>. </p>



<p>Announced via an <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPjJRG-DUkg/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA=="">animated short film</a> created by Annie Choi, Liang’s childhood in New York is reimagined through a nostalgic lens. We see her sketching before her own “dream closet” comes to life with new clothes that empower her before she captures a shooting star. The aesthetic and playfulness perfectly captures Liang’s signature whimsical designs. </p>



<p>“‘Sandy’s Dream Closet’ illustrates how wearing Gap made me feel growing up as I imagined being an adult one day and who I could be,” Liang said in a press release. “I wanted to take the pieces that meant something to me as a kid and reimagine them through my lens today — celebrating girlhood in all its forms, while honoring the iconic styles that make Gap so timeless.”</p>



<p>And with Gap’s portfolio of collaborations, like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-beis-luggage-collaboration-2025"">with Béis</a> (and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-studio-summer-new-arrivals"">GapStudio</a>’s recent <a href=""https://www.gap.com/browse/new/gapstudio?cid=3045197&amp;mlink=5058,1,HP_MERCH_BANNER_GAPSTUDIO_LAUNCH_W_ShopCollection"">partnership with Gweneth Paltrow</a> and Apple Martin), we know that this on-point designer collab will be another sought-after and successful one.</p>

<p>Known for her feminine aesthetic via pastels, ruffles, and bows, Liang is bringing her style to Gap via a trench coat with an oversized bow, a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ballet-sneaker-shoe-trend"">Mary Jane ballet flat</a>-printed sweater, and a denim baseball cap with “star” written in Gap’s logo font. You’ll also find Gap essentials, like fleece hoodies and wide-leg jeans with the Liang treatment (AKA bow stitching and the designer’s first name). And don’t forget about the children (not just your inner child) — there will be online-exclusive baby and toddler styles, like a onesie, sweatsuit, and spotted fur jacket (which matches the womenswear style lower down). </p>



<p>“Sandy Liang has cultivated both an engaged community and an iconic design perspective, which has allowed her to reimagine our heritage pieces into something entirely new, yet familiar,” said President and CEO of Gap, Mark Breitbard, in the release.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-7-virtues-vanilla-woods-perfume-fragrance-review"">vanilla perfume trend</a> isn’t going anywhere soon — if anything, perfume’s favorite gourmand has only gotten more ubiquitous these days. And when it comes to vanilla scents, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/"">Noyz</a> is down bad. The Los Angeles-based perfume label has multiple interpretations of the popular note, including editor-favorite <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/noyz-detour-vanilla-perfume-review"">Detour</a>, which debuted earlier this year.</p>



<p>But we’re here to talk about the brand’s latest launch, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/only-human"">Only Human</a>. The vanilla-forward scent combines the warm, cozy appeal of gourmands with the intoxicating vibe of another major fragrance trend: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/best-skin-scents"">Skin scents</a>.</p>



<p>Notes of vanilla bean, ambroxan, and cedarwood blend with invigorating pink pepper, bergamot, and lily to create a scent that’s complex, addictive, and perfect for fall. Combining vanilla with woody notes isn’t unheard of (Case in point: Another editor-beloved scent, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-7-virtues-vanilla-woods-perfume-fragrance-review"">7 Virtues’ Vanilla Woods</a>.) But as the name suggests, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/only-human"">Only Human</a> is all about tapping into the sensual alchemy of two people connecting — per the brand, it’s rumored to smell a bit different on everyone, <em>à la </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-glossier-you-perfume-new-formula"">Glossier You</a>.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/only-human"">Noyz Only Human 50ML</a>, $85 </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937307.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>I personally think that <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/only-human"">Only Human</a>‘s magic lies in its tightrope-like balance of sweet vanilla, spicy pink pepper, citrusy bergamot, and floral waterlily. At first spritz, the vanilla definitely comes through. But throughout the day, it dries down, leaving room for the floral and ambrox notes to emerge. As with all Noyz creations, you can choose (or indulge in all) from a <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/only-human"">50mL full size</a>, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/only-human?variant=50542921122075"">15mL travel spray</a>, and twist-up <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/the-solid-fragrance-only-human"">solid fragrance balm</a>. To say that I’ve found my favorite fall fragrance isn’t just fun alliteration — it’s a fact, thanks to Noyz.</p>

<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/halloween"">Spooky season</a> is here, a time of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scary-ghost-stories-legends"">ghost stories</a>, flickering candles, and marathons of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scariest-movies-of-all-time"">horror classics</a>. But for many of us, autumn isn’t just about <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/09/208186/scary-halloween-costumes-horror-movies"">scary costumes</a> and pumpkin carving (though we definitely love all of that, too). This season opens a portal for honoring ancestors, embracing transformation, and connecting to the unseen.<br /><br />As the days shorten, leaves fall, and the earth prepares to rest, the veil between the physical and spiritual realms thin. In this liminal space, we can feel our ancestors getting closer, guiding, protecting, and reminding us of who we are and where we come from. From the marigolds and copal on Mexico’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dia-de-los-muertos-for-mom"">Día de Muertos</a> altars, to rum offerings to the orishas in Afro-Caribbean traditions, to pachamama rituals that return food to the soil in gratitude in the Andean region, this is a time of conversation between the living and the dead. <br /><br />But it’s also a season of harvest, moments when we gather the lessons and blessings of what we’ve sown throughout the year. Brujas and healers use this energy to reflect, give thanks, and release. Across Latin American and Latine communities, this could take many forms: a limpia with ruda or rosemary to clear energy, lighting copal or palo santo to call in guidance, or creating a small bóveda espiritual to honor those who came before us. <br /><br />Whether you come from a long line of spiritual practitioners or are beginning to follow your mystical curiosities, autumn invites us to embrace the spiritual. We've gathered some of our favorite Latina-owned witchy brands and tools to help you cleanse the energy around you, connect with yourself and your ancestors, manifest your next chapter, or create your own rituals.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

Many of Bruja's items — from candles to oils — are naturally and wildly hand-crafted by Martinez and other local Indigenous spiritualists and artists.<br /><br />""Our ancestors practiced centuries-old healing methods that included native plants and herbs as well as undocumented rituals that have been passed down generation to generation, and we are striving to keep these alive,"" Martinez, who founded the shop in October 2023, tells Refinery29 Somos. ""When people ask why ancestral practices still matter, I say because our bodies remember what our calendars forget. Ritual is how we slow down, heal, and reconnect — to ourselves, to each other, and to the land.""<br /><br />With her <a href=""https://www.bruja.store/bruja-boxes"">Bruja boxes</a>, Martinez makes it easy to bring this ritual work into your life.

<p>After playing stubborn, anti-capitalist, one-of-the-boys <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2021/07/10607247/outer-banks-season-2-cast-new-characters-list"">Kiara “Kie” Carrera</a> for four seasons on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYBRxU8XSy8""><em>Outer Banks</em></a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/04/9690851/outer-banks-netflix-cast-friendship-roommates"">Madison Bailey</a> is entering her rom-com era. In <a href=""https://www.primevideo.com/detail/Maintenance-Required/0MXYDY9ZW9JL8NF3C0EX7DIG33"">Prime Video’s <em>Maintenance Required</em></a><em>, </em>she plays Izzy, one part of an all-female mechanic shop who loves wearing head-to-toe pink as much as she loves giving manicures to people as they wait for their car repairs. Izzy’s best friend Charlie (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9937462/madelaine-petsch-interview-birth-control"">Madelaine Petsch</a>) owns the shop and is in a complicated situationship with Beau (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jacobscipio/?hl=en"">Jacob Scipio</a>), her anonymous online crush she doesn’t realize is also her corporate rival IRL. While sparks fly on and offline for Charlie and Beau, her besties Izzy and Kam (Katy O’Brian) provide the comedic relief and humor often lacking in recent romance movies. The movie is a classic rom-com (a nice modern twist on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/youve-got-mail""><em>You’ve Got Mail</em></a>) that allows Bailey to show off, as she puts it, a “more feminine” side we have yet to see from her onscreen.  </p>



<p>Now that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/outer-banks-netflix-review-teen-drama""><em>Outer Banks</em></a> is filming its <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/outer-banks-season-5"">fifth and final season</a>, which Bailey is feeling “deeply sentimental” about, she’ll have the chance to explore whatever she wants. Whether that’s music (her first love), more acting, or all of the above, Bailey is certain she wants to explore all the different facets of her identity as a Black, queer woman. Over Zoom, Bailey talks to Refinery29 about OBX season 5, what’s next for her after <em>Outer Banks</em>, putting the “com” in rom-com <em>Maintenance Required</em>, and her thoughts on the age-old nail shapes debate: square or almond? </p>



<p><strong>Refinery29: This is such a fun part and a fun movie. What made you want to take on this role? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Madison Bailey: </strong>It is such a fun movie, and I think that’s why I wanted to be part of it. I read the script and [was excited] to be the comedy part of a rom-com. It just felt like something very different from what I’ve done before. I’m also playing a much more feminine character than I’ve got to play on screen. And so I got to tap into this side of me, this girly girl side of me, that was really fun. Also the cast is amazing, and I wanted to work with them as well.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>In my 11 years of being an actor, it was maybe the easiest scene I’ve ever done.  </p><cite>madison bailey on singing ‘super bass’ by nicki minaj in ‘maintenance required’</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>I love rom-coms and I love what you said about your character being the comedy part of this rom-com. In some recent “rom-coms” I feel like they are missing the comedy part, and this is a true romantic comedy in that it is very funny. So talk a little bit about that genre. What is it about the genre specifically that you love so much?</strong></p>



<p><strong>MB: </strong>​​Rom-coms are one of my favorite genres because they’re just fun to watch. You can fall for the characters quickly, and it’s an easy watch. Personally, one of my favorites is<em> 50 First Dates. </em>And I think it was really fun to do this genre that sort of had its peak in the early 2000s and I wish we were making more of them. I was happy to be doing a movie that I would be excited to watch.</p>



<p><strong>Bring them back! </strong></p>



<p><strong>MB: </strong>We need more! Just fun, easy, watches!</p>



<p><strong>We have to talk about the nails. Your character Izzy is a mechanic and also a nail tech. How long did those take? What was the process of coming up with the nail looks? </strong></p>



<p><strong>MB:</strong> The stylist and the nail tech on set definitely had some free reign. I have a green set and a pink set that I wear for the majority of the movie. I think I have four or five nail changes in total, two of them that I pitched and sent pictures for inspo for it was super collaborative. </p>



<p><strong>Where did you find the inspiration? </strong></p>



<p><strong>MB:</strong> Pinterest, Instagram, TikTok, just on my socials. And I was like,<em> Oh, this is so cool.</em> I love fun nails personally. I love a simple fringe, but I also love doing all of the things and making every nail different. The process of putting on the nails was pretty easy. We just did nail stickers because I couldn’t actually do acrylic due to having to change them per scene. So it was a little bit of a task because they weren’t as secure. I didn’t get to just live my normal life with acrylic nails. They were very lightly on, so the whole day kind of looks like this<em> [motions gingerly picking up things with her nails]</em>, and a lot of being so careful. I just accepted that they were gonna pop off throughout the day.</p>



<p><strong>Was there ever a moment where you had to stop a take or stop rolling mid scene because they popped off?</strong></p>



<p><strong>MB: </strong>Absolutely!<strong> </strong>Or I was just like, and we’re rolling, and I’m like, <em>no, no, no, I don’t have my nails. I’m missing two. I cannot! </em></p>



<p><strong>What’s your answer to the age-old debate: almond or square nails? </strong></p>



<p><strong>MB: </strong>In the movie I had two long square sets and two shorter almond sets. Personally, I like long and tapered squares, not completely square. But not stiletto because I feel like it’s hard to do that. So just a tapered square for me personally.</p>



<p><strong>I’m an almond girlie right now but it’s okay, we’ll agree to disagree.</strong></p>



<p><strong>MB:</strong><em> [laughs] </em>I love the long almond though! I like the long almonds better than the short almond.</p>



<p><strong>The chemistry between you, Madelaine Petsch and Katy O’Brian was my favorite thing in the movie. How did you develop that bond? </strong></p>



<p><strong>MB: </strong>We were really fortunate for the majority of it to just come very naturally to all of us. As far as bonding, we did a lot of dinners, we did some activities, like an escape room, just fun things hanging out. Off set [hangouts] always help. But also I think we just clicked immediately.</p>



<p><strong>It really leapt off screen. There’s a scene where you’re all in the car and you’re all rapping along to “Super Bass” by Nicki Minaj. I know you’re an artist yourself. Did you have to prep for that scene or were those lyrics already right here?</strong></p>



<p><strong>MB: </strong>No, honestly, in my 11 years of being an actor, it was maybe the easiest scene I’ve ever done. <em>[laughs]</em> I was like,<em> I know my lines. I’m off book. I’m ready to go call action. Where are we starting? </em>“Super Bass” is one of those songs that people dedicated to learning the lyrics like 10 years ago and you’ll never forget them.</p>



<p><strong>Yes! I’ll be in a nursing home and still know “Super Bass.” Are you a Barb?</strong></p>



<p><strong>MB:</strong> <em>[laughs] </em>I would say I’m a Barb. I definitely am.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937221.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p><strong>You mentioned the femininity of your character’s style and having to tap into that. How fun was it to tap into that feminine side when that’s not  necessarily what we’ve seen you do on screen in the past?</strong></p>



<p><strong>MB:</strong> It was just so fun. I would say I’m a girly girl [but] I typically play very tomboy characters so I was very excited to tap into this side of myself and map out the looks and collaborate with the stylist. We wanted her style to be funky, but not unrealistic, just maximalist and fun and then with the jewelry, bringing some Oakland swag to her. </p>



<p><strong>We know that <em>Outer Banks </em></strong><strong>is ending with Season 5, which you are shooting now. How are you feeling about it? </strong></p>



<p><strong>MB: </strong>Deeply sentimental. Not only are we just trying to absorb everything for the last time and just really take it in, I think we’ve all been overwhelmed with gratitude this year. I would say that’s the number one word: gratitude. We show our love to each other every day. We always tell each other that and we’ve just built such a support group and such a bond. It’s going to be so insane to not be working with these people anymore, and I think we’re feeling all that comes with that. Like, the other day, we were like,<em> This is our Is this our last boat day? </em>Like,<em> is this our last time going out on the boats and coming back in at sunset? </em>We’re all in our feels this year.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> Not only are we just trying to absorb everything for the last time and just really take it in, I think we’ve all been overwhelmed with gratitude this year… We’re all in our feels.</p><cite>madison bailey on the end of ‘outer banks’</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>What can you tease about Season 5? </strong></p>



<p><strong>MB: </strong>What can I tease? I would just say that this season holds a different space tonally than we’ve seen in past seasons. We’re all dealing with this loss [JJ’s death], and we see it pan out for all of these characters that are typically free-for-all, nothing-to-lose kids, and then we experience a loss and it hits all of us.</p>



<p><strong>That vibe seems like maybe it felt very apropos to how you are all feeling about grieving the end of the show.</strong></p>



<p><strong>MB: </strong>Yeah. I mean, there’s definitely moments where we’re in tears [for the show] and there’s more to cry about. I’m looking around like, <em>Ah, everything’s so sad. This is it! This is our last year! </em>But like I said, just feeling so grateful.</p>



<p><strong>On the flip side of that, is there something that you’re most excited for when it comes to life after <em>Outer Banks</em></strong><strong>?</strong></p>



<p><strong>MB:</strong> I think I’m excited to just to really be able to pick the projects that I want to do. I think I have done amazing projects that I really wanted to do. But it’s also like there is an element of what I can do in this timeframe? And there are scripts that I’ve loved that [I couldn’t do] because they were shooting while I’m shooting [<em>Outer Banks</em>]. So I’m excited to have the availability in my schedule to really map out what I want to do.</p>



<p><strong>You’re someone who’s been so outspoken about the intersections of your identity as a queer person and a biracial Black person. Is that something that you’re thinking of when you’re looking at what you’re going to do next? </strong></p>



<p><strong>MB: </strong>Absolutely. I mean, it’s my hope that by the time I’m done with this amazing job that I have, that I will have been able to tell not only stories that I’m not that familiar with, but also to be able to tell all the stories within myself. Because, like you said, I am intersectional. I’m a woman, I’m Black, I’m queer, and I want to tell all of those stories from different perspectives and multiple times. I’m excited for those opportunities.</p>



<p><strong>We are Refinery29 so one of the questions we love to ask is: what advice would you give to your 29 year old self? I know it’s only in a couple years. </strong></p>



<p><strong>MB: </strong>What do I want to tell my 29 year old self? You know what? I’ve said that 30 sounds a lot better than 29 so I would tell my 29-year-old self to just wait it out. Like, next year is your year. Next year the fun starts. Enjoy your last year in your 20s for what it is but they make it sound so fun. I’m 26 and I’m telling you, 30 has got to be good, because this is tough. So I would say just soak it in and know that the best years are on the way.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936918.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>It’s officially boot season (thank goodness) so it’s time to upgrade your shoe game with classic <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/knee-high-boot"">knee-highs</a> and suede booties, trendy moto and slouchy styles, and especially <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-cowboy-boots-summer"">cowboy boots</a>. I never personally embraced the Western aesthetic… that is until I tested my first pair of <a href=""https://www.tecovas.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tecovas</a> boots almost a year ago.<br /><br />The <a href=""https://www.tecovas.com/products/the-jolene?color=caramel-bone--cowhide"">Jolene boots</a> (with their horseshoe pattern) have become a cross-seasonal staple in my wardrobe. Whether I dress them up with a leather blazer or down with flare jeans, these boots are surprisingly versatile (although it’s probably <em>not surprising</em> to all those in the West and South who regularly wear them).</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936926.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>So when Tecovas recently opened its first New York storefront, I knew I had to visit. And, wow, did I get a taste of Texas’ Southern hospitality. From the complimentary (!) customization bar (I got the limited-edition Statue of Liberty design branded onto my new boots) to an actual 21+ bar (I recommend the Bourbon &amp; Birch cocktail), the warm, saloon-like space is like a Western escape in the middle of Manhattan.</p>



<p>After exploring additional in-store amenities (including hat shaping and boot cleaning), I tried new styles across the brand’s boots, hats, and bags. But Tecovas isn’t just in the accessories game; Tecovas’ <a href=""https://www.tecovas.com/shop/apparel/womens"">new fall styles</a> include everything from cozy cardigans and kitschy graphic tees to vintage-inspired jeans.<br /><br />Read on for my honest reviews of some of the <a href=""https://www.tecovas.com/shop/womens?collection=new-arrivals"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">newest Tecovas styles</a>, and to shop your own pair of boots or accessories for the upcoming seasons (especially since there’s no sign of the cowgirl aesthetic going out of style). </p>

<h2>New Tecovas Leather Cowboy Boots</h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936920.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936921.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Unsurprising to myself, I was immediately drawn to one of the brand’s most expensive boot styles. <a href=""https://www.tecovas.com/products/the-annie?color=bone-cowhide"">The Annie boot</a> is a bestseller that typically ranges between $345 and $365, but the limited-edition, color-blocked eel leather costs a pretty $595. The shiny leather and rich colors are very luxurious, and pair perfectly with the brand’s new eel <a href=""https://www.tecovas.com/products/eel-concho-clutch?color=green-eel"">Concho Clutch</a> for special occasions. <br /><br />Another special option (with a lower price tag) is the bestselling <a href=""https://www.tecovas.com/products/the-sadie?color=toasted-almond-suede"">Sadie boot</a>, which has a shorter profile and now comes in metallic goldish-greenish cowhide leather. These are the perfect pair for nights out — like going line dancing with your besties, which is surging in popularity — or to channel an anticipated Act III album from Beyoncé. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>New Tecovas Suede Cowboy Boots</h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936922.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936923.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>I’m a sucker for suede boots, so I was excited to try new styles. The Annie in suede is very classic, but the new distressed charcoal color is a bit more fresh. The Sadie is also available in suede, and this pair features intricate braiding that I found really beautiful.<br /><br />Now, onto the boot I <em>couldn’t</em> wear: <a href=""https://www.tecovas.com/products/the-abby?color=eclipse-suede"">The Abby</a>. I generally have to order wide-calf boots for myself, so I was skeptical about trying the brand’s knee-high and over-the-knee styles. While The Annie is offered in wide-calf options, others are not, so I couldn’t quite slip The Abigail all the way up. But pro tip: every Tecovas store offers free boot stretching. I witnessed this service in person when a worker stretched the shaft of a boot up to an extra inch wider. This is a huge perk if you’re able to make it into a store so that your boots fit perfectly.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>New Tecovas Cowboy Hats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936924.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936925.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>I don’t typically wear hats because of my stingy bangs, but I was eager to try my first cowboy hat. The brand has a range of styles — from “cowboy hats” with curved brims to “cowgirl hats” with flat wide brims — that are available in several sizes. The unisex <a href=""https://www.tecovas.com/products/cattleman-straw-cowboy-hat?color=natural-straw"">Cattleman Straw Cowboy Hat</a> and <a href=""https://www.tecovas.com/products/the-belle-wool-cowgirl-hat?color=medium-brown-wool"">The Belle Wool Cowgirl Hat</a> were my favorite.<br /><br />Tecovas also offers tons of trucker caps, including new styles you can shop below. I finally left the store with the new <a href=""https://www.tecovas.com/products/mechanic-denim-6-panel-mid-pro-hat?color=blue-denim"">Mechanic Denim Hat</a>, which seems more feasible to wear around NYC for weekend walks, to baseball games, or at festivals than a wide-brim hat. I think it’ll also pair great with my go-to denim-on-denim outfits and cowboy boots for fall outings. </p>

<p>On Saturday at 4am, I found myself en route to see Taylor Swift’s <em><a href=""https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/taylor-swift-release-party-of-a-showgirl-uk-ireland-box-office-1236541930/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Official Release Party of a Showgirl</a></em> cinematic experience. In all my years as a diehard fan, I wouldn’t say experiences like this are out of the ordinary. For example, in 2012, my friends and I were handpicked out of the crowd at the <em>Red</em> stadium tour by Andrea Swift to enter the VIP pit, where I was so close I was able to <em>touch </em>Taylor when she walked into the crowd. I was on the front page of the <em>Sydney Morning Herald</em> for successfully buying <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/08/11488663/taylor-swift-eras-tour-non-swiftie"">Eras Tour</a> tickets. I was there at the <em>Speak Now</em>, <em>1989</em> and <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;""><em>Reputation</em></span> tours. I weathered backlash during the great Kimye V. Taylor feud of 2016;  I held my head high during the <em>ME!</em> video premiere. In terms of being a Swiftie, I’ve seen it all. </p>



<p>I truly <em>adore </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/taylor-swift"">Taylor Swift </a>— I think she’s brilliant and truly one of the greatest songwriters of all time. I love her “brand” and the projection of what “Taylor Swift” signifies. Her records mean a lot to me, and I’ve loved studying every element of evolution, as I’ve grown up with her — in many ways, she is the older sister I never had. Her DNA is in the fabric of literally every single pop girl making waves right now (no matter how much certain ones try to deny it), and her impact on the music industry is historic. </p>



<p>My drive to the cinema, however, was filled with mixed feelings, as less than 12 hours before, I’d had an extremely lukewarm reaction to Swift’s 12th record, <em><a href=""https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-life-of-a-showgirl/1838810949"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Life of a Showgirl</a></em><a href=""https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-life-of-a-showgirl/1838810949"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">.</a> I wasn’t the only one who’d picked up on a significant vibe shift and lack of…pizzazz that was promised from the Max Martin-produced record, marketed as a behind-the-curtain reflection on the pomp, grandiosity, chaos and confusion that comes with being a showgirl. <br /><br />Instead, the record reads more like an attempt at appearing nonchalant towards the negative noise, while simultaneously only focusing on it, sandwiched between a few peppy love songs. Unlike the defined sonic-directions of Swift’s previous 11 records, there’s little through-line between the palette, and at times, the writing leaves little to the imagination. To me, there’s a distinct lack of yearning on this record — a defining trait in Swift’s lyricism. </p>



<p>It’s captured best in classic songs like “White Horse,” “Mirrorball”<em> </em>and<em> </em>“Enchanted,” to name a few. The characters she’s written about — whether fictional or real — have always been written from the point of view of an observer. Someone who’s invited to the party, but doesn’t fit in. An onlooker who romanticizes historical figures as projections of her most idealized self. Now that Swift is the be-all and end-all of pop, are those days gone? Or, is her pen yet to catch up with the character she’s become?</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936999.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Fans on TikTok are posting edits that watch like an obituary, grieving an <em>actual </em>old, “dead” version of Swift. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/03/taylor-swift-the-life-of-a-showgirl-review"">Critics have called it dull </a>and noted its lack of <a href=""https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/taylor-swift-the-life-of-a-showgirl/"">compelling songwriting in comparison </a>to her previous material. Others have called out the boring marketing campaign based around flogging variants in order for Swift to finally beat the record for the biggest opening sales week for a female artist in history (currently held by Adele, which she is likely projected to break). </p>



<p>So, why does this album feel so different? In a career so perfectly executed, where does a misfire like this come from? Is it billionaire arrogance? Is it the confidence that comes after exiting the most successful tour in music and successfully buying back your masters? Is her team currently full of yes-men high on her supply?</p>



<p>It’s hard not to compare Swift to other stadium-pop acts to gain perspective on where her career ‘should’ be placed at this stage. Bruce Springsteen’s twelfth album <em>The Rising, </em>released in the wake of 9/11, was considered by fans and critics to be somewhat of a return to form after a lengthy career break. Pitchfork referred to large chunks of Madonna’s 12th record, MDNA as “shockingly banal” and Paul McCartney’s 12th album, Driving Rain, was the lowest-selling of his career at the time. Swift’s most modern contemporary, Beyoncé, is only eight albums in, and frankly, most current groundbreaking artists probably won’t get to that stage in their career. </p>



<p>Swift’s career has now spanned three decades. Where her millennial pop peers have failed to retain relevance, Swift has managed to manoeuvre through the popsphere while rewriting the playbook of the genre. The catapulting of her already immense influence and popularity into something bigger began with the release of <em>Folklore</em> and <em>Evermore</em> in 2020. The luscious indie rock-inspired records captured hearts and minds everywhere amidst pandemic moodiness and capitalized on the bubbling underground of female-centric indie folk in the vein of Phoebe Bridgers and Big Thief. Then came the re-recordings of Fearless and Red, forcing critics (and haters) to reevaluate the impact of those records. A pivotal moment from this time was the release of “All Too Well (10 Minute Version)” and it’s visually stunning music video directed and written by Swift. It proved her dominance as a multidisciplinary artist, and gave us a look into some of her non-musical inspirations, like the films of John Cassavetes. </p>



<p>Then came the Eras tour and its endless parade of celebration and number-crunching. Her opening acts like beabadoobee, MUNA, Paramore, HAIM, Phoebe Bridgers and girl in red each represented different ways in which Swift’s oeuvre has touched different parts of the musical landscape, from fuzzed-out modern grunge, to bouncy 80s-inspired indie pop. <em>Midnights</em> once again showcased her effortless transition into moody and sultry lo-fi synth-pop and <em>Tortured Poets</em> may just go down as her most experimental album yet. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936998.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>These events all created a completely unexpected phenomenon (as a long-time fan) — it became cool to like Taylor Swift. Coolness, the most elusive, fleeting and important quality in this cultural zeitgeist to obtain.  Aside from that, it also firmly positioned Swift as both the most fully frontal influence and the carrier of the pop current frontier. Those made in her image — Olivia Rodrigo, Gracie Abrams, Sabrina Carpenter and others, have all begun forging careers that have followers wondering who the pop baton will be passed on to — if allowed. </p>



<p>Swift has established herself as the ultimate Pop Imperialist. She has laid out the expectation that all of her eras are to be treated with the utmost significance and that each era would give a glimpse into her ever-developing taste and skill as a songwriter and sonic curator. Unfortunately, it seems like the fans have decided that <em>The Life Of A Showgirl</em> does not compete in this exact frontier she created. It’s clear she wanted to capitalize on the momentum of the last few years in an attempt to prove her all-encompassing influence. Between the album’s hollow theme, mindless marketing and meh-worthy lyricism, it all feels just too tired. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Unfortunately, it seems like the fans have decided that <em>The Life Of A Showgirl</em> does not compete in this exact frontier she created.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In any other genre, when the crown is passed to the next generation of greats, the legends can sit back and rest on their laurels and find their lifestyles through anniversary tours and middling albums that pass enough to justify a tour. As a lifelong fan of emo and pop punk, I know this game well. However, Swift has never been one to retire to the trophy room. Swift simply refuses to pass this baton, and her kung fu grip on pop’s crown handicapped this record and watered down her best qualities. In some ways, as a devotee of hers, I admire her delusion and chutzpah. On the other hand, it has led to this whole rollout feeling empty. </p>



<p>In saying this, I do believe some of the criticisms being thrown at the album are genuinely unfair. Some have said that the track “Wi$h Li$T” (which features one of the album’s best chorus top-lines), which thematically dives into wanting to get married and have kids, peddles a Republican ‘trad wife’ narrative. Personally, I think the supposed Charli XCX diss-track “Actually Romantic” is one of the better songs on the record. Is it a little corny? Yes. Is it supposed to be? I think so. There are also glimmers of beauty on the album — the bridge of “Eldest Daughter” is classic Swift-exuberance, the <em>Fearless</em>-esque bounce of “Ruin The Friendship” is pure whimsy, and the witty, playful lyricism of the title track are reminders of what we love most about her. </p>



<p>Watching the music video and its behind-the-scenes content in cinemas was also <em>so much </em>fun. Seeing Swift at work directing the music video for “The Fate of Ophelia” likely just months after wrapping the Eras Tour encapsulates her second-to-none work ethic and boundless imagination. She also provides an explanation behind the inspiration of each track, giving fans a glimpse into her ever-awkward, cutesy and funny persona. However, during these explanations, at times, it did feel like even Swift was at a loss in describing themes and inspirations. It’s one of the more shallow reflections on her songwriting we’ve ever been given, in comparison to, say, the <em>Long Pond Sessions</em>.</p>



<p>Haters will use this moment as a “gotcha” to prove their thoughts that she’s “actually bad” and her fame is a “scam”. Obviously, this is inherently incorrect. Is this album a cultural misfire? Yes. Will it completely tarnish Swift’s legacy overall? No. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> Is this album a cultural misfire? Yes. Will it completely tarnish Swift’s legacy overall? No. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Swift herself has said that there won’t be a tour off the back of this record (which should be terrifying news for economists everywhere, and thankful news to the wallets of fans). She also squashed the “deeply offensive” rumors that she’ll hang up the boots once she’s married. I am almost certain Swift’s 13th era will be her biggest yet — it just wouldn’t be right if it wasn’t. It is undeniable that culture is moving at a rapid and alarming rate. There is potential that Swift may not have the leverage to pull off numbers akin to the last few years by the time this rolls around. But, if there’s one thing Swift has proven through every cultural pivot, is that sharing the scariest and most raw parts of growing up and navigating the world is what truly connects — and there’ll be real fans waiting with excitement to see what the next era brings. </p>
