<p>Traditional Ukrainian vernacular architecture evolved through simple yet expressive solutions: thick whitewashed walls, thatched roofs, and regular plastering as an act of care and an aspiration toward order and beauty. In YOD Group's contemporary interpretation of traditional Ukrainian Hata-Mazanka, this pursuit of light and cleanliness is translated into fully transparent glass façades, while the roof – deliberately oversized – becomes the project's primary architectural gesture. Its sculptural form defines a strong, instantly recognisable silhouette, evoking both a traditional tall hat and an oversized mushroom rising from the landscape.</p>",

<h3><strong>The 80% job: how design leads are using AI — and it’s not about mockups</strong></h3><h4>Design leads spend 80% of their time communicating, aligning, and justifying. That’s exactly where AI helps most.</h4><figure><img alt=""A drawing of a man looking straight at the camera surrounded by a crowded desk"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bR4xPhoVSjwHhgLtf6Pdew.png"" /><figcaption>Image generated with <a href=""https://www.midjourney.com"">Midjourney</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Part 1: The Reality of Design Leadership</h3><p>Here’s what my job description says I do: set design vision, mentor designers, elevate craft quality, drive innovation.</p><p>Here’s what I actually do: run 1:1s, mediate conflicts, write justifications for decisions, align with stakeholders, update Jira, answer Slack, prepare for meetings, sit in meetings, follow up on meetings.</p><p>I lead a team of 7 designers at a European bank. I can’t remember the last time I opened Figma for actual design work.</p><p>This isn’t a complaint. This is the job. And if you’re a design lead, you probably recognize it.</p><p>(Whether your title is Design Lead, Chapter Lead, Head of Design, or Design Manager — if you’re responsible for other designers and their output, this is for you.)</p><h4>The Myth vs The Reality</h4><p>When I was an individual contributor, I assumed design leads spent their days reviewing designs, setting creative direction, and occasionally stepping in to solve tough UX problems.</p><p>Then I became one.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/72103bc2102b"">Megan Schofield</a> <strong>Experience Design Manager at Google</strong>, put it perfectly in an interview with <a href=""https://www.goabstract.com/blog/stakeholder-review-meetings"">Abstract</a>:</p><blockquote>“I would be inclined to propose that we, as designers, actually spend a significant amount of time, not designing, but in fact communicating, reviewing, justifying and defending.”</blockquote><p>Here’s what the typical breakdown actually looks like:</p><h4>What job descriptions say:</h4><p>- 30% Design strategy &amp; vision<br />- 25% Mentoring &amp; craft elevation<br />- 20% Stakeholder collaboration<br />- 15% Process improvement<br />- 10% Hands-on design work</p><h4>What the calendar says:</h4><p>- 30% Meetings (syncs, reviews, alignments, 1:1s)<br />- 25% Communication (Slack, email, status updates)<br />- 20% People management (coaching, conflict resolution, career conversations)<br />- 20% Justification (proposals, business cases, defending decisions)<br />- 5% Operations (Jira, planning, HR, tools, budgets)</p><p><strong>That’s 100% before you even get to design.</strong></p><p>Notice what’s missing? Exactly.</p><p>This isn’t because we’re bad at our jobs. It’s because the job isn’t what we thought it was.</p><h4>Why This Happens</h4><p>This isn’t a failure of time management. It’s structural.</p><p>Design leads sit at an intersection that no one else occupies. You’re translating between:</p><p>- Designers who think in users and flows<br />- Developers who think in systems and constraints<br />- Business stakeholders who think in metrics and deadlines</p><p><strong>You’re the only one in the room who speaks all three languages</strong>. So you become the translator, the mediator, the justifier.</p><p>Add to that: most design teams exist inside non-design hierarchies. You report to Product, or Engineering, or in my case, a Tribe Lead responsible for multiple disciplines.</p><p>This means every design decision carries a “<strong>justification tax</strong>” — the time spent explaining, documenting, and defending choices that other disciplines make in a quick conversation.</p><p>When your engineering counterpart says “we’ll use microservices,” nobody asks for a slide deck. When you say “we need to simplify this flow,” suddenly you need user data, business impact, and a prototype to prove it.</p><p>That’s the job. And once you accept it, you can start optimizing for it.</p><h4>The 80% Opportunity</h4><p>Here’s where it gets interesting.</p><p>If 80% of the job is communication, documentation, and justification — that’s exactly where AI tools excel.</p><p>And yes, AI is already changing design work itself. Tools like <a href=""https://cursor.sh/"">Cursor</a>, <a href=""https://lovable.dev/"">Lovable</a>, and <a href=""https://www.figma.com/ai/"">Figma AI</a> mean we’re not starting from scratch anymore — not on code, not on prototypes, not on layouts.</p><p>But here’s what most “AI for designers” content misses: design leads don’t spend their days in Figma. W<strong>e spend them in Slack, Docs, and meetings.</strong></p><p>So while AI-generated mockups get the headlines, the bigger opportunity for leads is quieter: drafting that stakeholder update. Summarizing research into exec-friendly bullets. Turning meeting notes into action items. Writing the first version of a business case.</p><p>The stuff that eats your calendar but doesn’t require your craft skills.</p><p>The next parts of this series will break down exactly how I use AI for each of these:</p><p>- Synthesizing research without drowning in transcripts<br />- Writing business cases that actually get read<br />- Communicating with stakeholders in their language<br />- Enabling my team without becoming a bottleneck</p><p>This isn’t about working faster. <strong>It’s about reclaiming time for the 20% that actually needs a design lead’s judgment</strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""A drawing of an old desk with a big red clock above the desk"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Q6efJjHmz22Z4Cve-8SPOQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image generated with <a href=""https://www.midjourney.com"">Midjourney</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Part 2: AI for Admin — Reclaim Your Time</h3><p>Before we get to the exciting stuff (building prototypes, validating ideas), let’s address the elephant in the room: the 80% of your week that isn’t design work.</p><p>The <a href=""https://www.stateofaidesign.com/"">State of AI in Design Report 2025</a> by Foundation Capital and Designer Fund found that <strong>89% of designers say AI has improved their workflow, with 84% using it in the research and ideation phase while only 39% use it during delivery.</strong>*</p><p><em>*Note: This report comes from VC and investment firms with stakes in the AI design space — it’s useful directional data, not independent academic research.</em></p><p>Design leads? We’re not even in those stats. We’re too busy in meetings.</p><p>So let’s fix that.</p><h4>Start with what hurts most</h4><p>For me, it was meetings. Six a day, sometimes more. By Friday, I couldn’t remember what we decided on Monday. Sound familiar?</p><p>I started using <a href=""https://tactiq.io/"">Tactiq</a>— it sits quietly in my Google Meet or Zoom calls, transcribes everything, and at the end gives me a summary with decisions and action items. What used to take me 20 minutes of post-meeting note cleanup now takes 2. <a href=""https://fireflies.ai/"">Fireflies.ai</a> does something similar and integrates with Slack if that’s where your team lives.</p><p>The trick isn’t the tool. It’s breaking the habit of thinking you need to manually capture everything. You don’t. Let the robot do it.</p><h4>Research doesn’t have to be a black hole</h4><p>Here’s a scenario: you’ve got 12 user interviews, survey results from 200 people, and a competitor analysis your team put together last quarter. Your stakeholder meeting is Thursday. They want “the key insights.”</p><p>This used to mean two days of reading, highlighting, and synthesizing. Now I dump everything into a tool like <a href=""https://dovetail.com/"">Dovetail</a> and ask it to find patterns. “<strong>What are the top 5 pain points mentioned by at least 3 users? Give me direct quotes as evidence.</strong>”</p><p>Is it perfect? No. You still need to sanity-check the output. But it gets you 70% of the way there in 30 minutes instead of 2 days.</p><p><a href=""https://notion.so/product/ai"">Notion AI</a> works well for this too if you’re already living in Notion. It can summarize messy interview notes, pull themes from a database, and clean up transcripts that look like someone typed with their elbows.</p><h4>A note on confidentiality</h4><p>If you work in a regulated industry — banking, healthcare, finance — <strong>you need to think carefully about what data you feed into AI tools</strong>. I work at a European bank with a security department that takes data classification seriously, and rightfully so.</p><p>User interview transcripts, internal research, and anything containing customer data should never go into a public AI tool without clearance. <strong>Check with your security and compliance teams first</strong>. Many organizations now have approved AI tool lists or enterprise versions with data processing agreements in place.</p><p>This isn’t a small thing. In financial services, confidentiality isn’t optional — it’s regulated. Plan your AI workflow around what’s approved, not what’s convenient. The last thing you want is to save 2 hours on research synthesis and spend 2 months explaining a data breach to regulators.</p><h4>Speaking stakeholder</h4><p>This one’s personal. I spend a lot of time translating design decisions into language that non-designers understand. “We need to simplify this flow” doesn’t land. “This flow has a 40% drop-off at step 3, and here’s why” does.</p><p>I use <a href=""https://claude.ai/"">Claude</a> for this. When I need to justify a timeline change or explain why we’re recommending a different approach, I’ll draft my argument and ask it to pressure-test it. “What would a skeptical product manager push back on here?” Then I refine before the actual conversation.</p><p>You can do the same with <a href=""https://chat.openai.com/"">ChatGPT</a>, though I find it tends to be more… diplomatic. Sometimes too diplomatic. When I ask for honest feedback, I want honest feedback, not a sandwich with compliments on both sides.</p><p>For research with sources, I use <a href=""https://perplexity.ai/"">Perplexity</a>. The key is always asking AI to provide references and data — it keeps hallucinations in check.</p><p><strong>Glen Coates, former VP of Product at Shopify (now at OpenAI)</strong>, put it well on <a href=""https://productschool.com/resources/product-podcast/Glen-coates-Ai-first-products"">The Product Podcast</a>:</p><blockquote>“I’ve now started taking screenshots and prompting AI to create a prototype from that. It speeds up the feedback cycle. It also helps me realize how dumb my ideas are before my team has to waste time on them.”</blockquote><p>That’s the mindset. Use AI to stress-test your thinking before you take it to the room.</p><h4>Documentation (the thing nobody wants to do)</h4><p>Engineers need specs. You have Figma files and a head full of context that hasn’t made it onto paper.</p><p>Here’s a prompt I use regularly:</p><p><em>“I’m handing off a new savings goal widget to engineering. It shows progress toward a target amount, lets users adjust their goal, and sends notifications at milestones. Write three user stories in standard format with acceptance criteria.”</em></p><p>What comes back isn’t production-ready, but it’s a solid draft I can refine in <strong>10 minutes</strong>. Compare that to the hour I used to spend staring at a blank Confluence page.</p><p>If your organization runs on Microsoft, <a href=""https://copilot.microsoft.com/"">Copilot</a> does this inside Word and can pull context from your emails and previous docs. Useful if you’re in a corporate environment where everything lives in SharePoint.</p><h4>Budget for exploration</h4><p>One thing I’d recommend: <strong>set aside a small monthly budget</strong> — even €20–30 — specifically for trying new AI tools. Treat it as a learning investment, the same way you’d invest in a course or a design book. Subscribe, experiment for a week, and cancel if it doesn’t add value. Many tools offer free tiers or trials, but the paid features are usually where the real time savings live.</p><p>Just remember to cancel the ones that don’t stick. I’ve learned this one the expensive way.</p><h4>One tool. One week. That’s it.</h4><p>Don’t try to automate your entire workflow overnight. Pick the one task that consistently eats your time:</p><p>- Meetings? Try <a href=""https://tactiq.io/"">Tactiq</a> or <a href=""https://fireflies.ai/"">Fireflies</a><br />- Research synthesis? Try <a href=""https://dovetail.com/"">Dovetail</a> or <a href=""https://notion.so/product/ai"">Notion AI</a><br />- Stakeholder communication? Try <a href=""https://claude.ai/"">Claude</a> or <a href=""https://chat.openai.com/)"">ChatGPT</a><br />- Documentation? Use AI prompts for user stories and specs</p><p><strong>Use it for one week. See if it actually saves time.</strong> Then add another.</p><p>The goal isn’t to become an AI power user. The goal is to reclaim 5 hours a week so you can do the work that actually matters.</p><figure><img alt=""A drawing of a crowded desk with multiple pictures and sketches on the wall"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DVcMh1vYif_vEckSaRlCqg.png"" /><figcaption>Image generated with <a href=""https://www.midjourney.com"">Midjourney</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Part 3: AI for Prototyping — How to Create Again</h3><h4>Remember why you got into design?</h4><p>Not the stakeholder emails. Not the capacity planning spreadsheets. The actual making of things.</p><p>Here’s what happened: as you climbed the ladder, you traded Figma time for meeting time. Makes sense — your value shifted from pixels to decisions. But somewhere along the way, most of us stopped creating anything at all.</p><p>I’m not here to argue that design leads should be doing hands-on design work. We shouldn’t — not for production anyway. That’s our team’s domain, and I’m fortunate to have an amazing team that handles craft with skill and care. <strong>What I don’t want to do is bypass them or create a dynamic where they feel undermined by a lead who keeps jumping into production work</strong>.</p><p>But there’s a different kind of creating that matters: the quick prototype that proves a point. The functional demo that ends the debate. The working thing that gets stakeholders to finally *see* what you’ve been trying to explain.</p><p>That’s what this part is about. Not replacing your team’s work — <strong>de-risking ideas before committing their time</strong>.</p><h4>The Real Problem with Figma Prototypes</h4><p>Traditional Figma prototypes are great for showing flows. Click here, go there, animate this.</p><p>But they hit a wall when you need to prove something works, not just looks right.</p><p>Try explaining a complex interaction to a VP who keeps asking “but what happens when…” and you’ll know what I mean. Or trying to get engineering buy-in on an approach they think is technically impossible.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/d07005ae7037"">Bryce York</a>, a startup product leader, nails this:</p><blockquote>“If you’re trying to get buy-in on a big concept, this can massively help your stakeholders really understand what you’re pitching. PMs have to have good imaginations, but most stakeholders’ roles don’t!”</blockquote><p>Static prototypes leave too much to imagination. Working prototypes end debates.</p><h4>Enter “Vibe Coding”</h4><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/ac9d9a35533e"">Andrej Karpathy</a> (co-founder of OpenAI) coined the term in early 2025. The idea: describe what you want in plain language, let AI write the code, iterate by running and refining.</p><p>You don’t need to become an engineer. You need to be able to say “I want a dashboard that shows account activity with filters for date range and transaction type” and get something functional back in minutes.</p><p>For design leads, this isn’t about learning to code. It’s about removing the bottleneck between your vision and something people can actually use.</p><p><a href=""https://www.cmu.edu/iii/about/news/2026/how-ai-and-vibe-coding-transform-product-management.html"">Carnegie Mellon’s Integrated Innovation</a> is already teaching this approach: “We now require vibe-coded prototypes rather than basic wireframes or sketches — reflecting what the workplace will demand.”</p><h4>The Tools (And When to Use Each)</h4><p>There’s no single right tool. Here’s how I think about them:</p><p><a href=""https://www.figma.com/make/"">Figma Make</a> — Best for: staying in your existing workflow</p><p>If your designs already live in Figma, this is the lowest friction option. Paste a frame, describe what you want interactive, and it generates working code. The killer feature: it understands your layers, components, and structure — not just the image.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/95d97a7d5732"">David Kossnick</a>, Head of AI Product at Figma, describes it:</p><blockquote>“We’re not just bringing the image when you copy a Figma frame. We’re giving AI the rich, structured data — layers, metadata, and styling details.”</blockquote><p>Good for: Quick interactive versions of existing designs, staying in familiar territory, sharing with team</p><p><a href=""https://lovable.dev/"">Lovable</a> — Best for: standalone prototypes without touching code</p><p>Lovable is probably the most designer-friendly of the bunch. You describe what you want, it generates a complete working app. No code editor, no terminal, no git.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/dc020be79c95"">Christine Vallaure</a> at UX Collective shares a practical tip:</p><blockquote>“If the first result feels messy or off, don’t try to rescue it. Start fresh with a cleaner prompt. It saves time and sanity.”</blockquote><p>The <a href=""https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/lovable-ai-for-ux/"">LogRocket team</a> tested it for UX workflows and found it generated a working, mobile-responsive UI with logic in about 20 seconds. Not production code, but enough to validate an idea.</p><p>Good for: Proving concepts to stakeholders, testing flows before committing design resources, personal projects</p><p><a href=""https://cursor.com/"">Cursor</a> — Best for: maximum control and flexibility</p><p>This one has a steeper learning curve — it’s a code editor, not a design tool. But it’s also the most powerful.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/72b03f90cf7d"">Joel Unger</a> Design Director at Atlassian, uses it to prototype complex Trello interactions:</p><blockquote>“AI is helping designers focus on higher-level thinking, communicate better with developers, and push creative boundaries.”</blockquote><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/745607030d8e"">Hardik Pandya</a>, also at Atlassian, spent 60+ hours vibe coding an elaborate product experience with data visualization, multi-device flows, and motion. His advice:</p><blockquote>“Your prototype gains the realism that makes stakeholders take it seriously.”</blockquote><p>Good for: Complex interactions, data-driven prototypes, designs that need to work with real APIs</p><h4>When It Goes Wrong</h4><p>It’s worth being honest about the limitations. Vibe coding can go spectacularly wrong when you trust the output without understanding it.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/9f12350bf325"">Tina Singh</a> wrote about this in Bootcamp: AI-generated prototypes often lose context between iterations, behavior exposes gaps that looked fine in a static design, and evolving a prototype through prompts can start to feel more like chance than craft. Her rule is practical: if you need twenty-plus prompt iterations to get something right, stop. At that point, it’s consuming more time than it saves.</p><p>I’ve hit this myself. I once spent an hour trying to get an AI-generated dashboard to handle edge cases in filter combinations — something my team could have resolved in a fraction of that time with a proper Figma prototype and a dev conversation. The lesson: vibe coding is excellent for proving *concepts*, not for polishing *details*. Know when to hand off.</p><p>Even Karpathy himself — <strong>the person who coined the term </strong>— has acknowledged the limitations. His later projects were hand-coded because AI agents weren’t reliable enough for what he needed.</p><p>The takeaway isn’t “don’t use these tools.” It’s “use them for what they’re good at: quick, disposable prototypes that prove a point and then get thrown away.”</p><h4>The Design Lead Angle</h4><p>Here’s what most “vibe coding tutorials” miss: they’re written for individual contributors who want to build side projects.</p><p>As a design lead, you’re not trying to ship code. You’re trying to:</p><p><strong>1. Win arguments faster</strong> — Instead of three rounds of stakeholder review on a concept, show them something working<br /><strong>2. De-risk before committing resources</strong> — Test if an idea is even viable before putting your team on it<br /><strong>3. Align engineering early</strong> — Nothing gets devs engaged like seeing a working prototype and being asked “is this technically feasible?”</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/abbf40336b08"">Patrick Neeman</a> tested several tools and concluded:</p><blockquote>“These tools are on a path to be game-changing for concept validation and stakeholder buy-in. While it’s not pixel perfect, it gives everyone a good idea how something would work, in some cases eliminating weeks to months of engineering time for realistic testing.”</blockquote><h4>Start Small</h4><p>You don’t need to build a complete product. You need to build enough to prove your point.</p><p>Pick one upcoming decision that’s stuck in debate. Maybe it’s:</p><p>- A new onboarding flow that stakeholders can’t visualize<br />- A dashboard concept engineering thinks is too complex<br />- A mobile feature that keeps getting deprioritized because “we’re not sure it’ll work”</p><p><strong>Spend an hour with one of these tools</strong>. Not to ship anything — just to have something to show.</p><p>The goal isn’t to replace your team’s work. It’s to create the artifact that gets everyone aligned before your team does the real work.</p><h4>What Stays Human</h4><p>One important caveat: these tools get you 70–80% of the way there. The last mile still needs judgment.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/dfe95783e10e"">Arpi Chugh</a>, a UX designer who tested Lovable extensively, captures it well:</p><blockquote>“I wasn’t using Lovable to come up with the design. I used it to test the design I already had in my head — faster than I ever could with traditional tools.”</blockquote><p>The thinking is still yours. The strategy is still yours. The AI just removes the friction between having an idea and being able to show it.</p><figure><img alt=""Drawing of an agenda with a big green checkmark and multiple annotations"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3kpUMG70NfcAj12FpgoR1Q.png"" /><figcaption>Image generated with <a href=""https://www.midjourney.com"">Midjourney</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Part 4: Validate Fast — From Prototype to Proof</h3><p>You built the prototype. It looks good. Stakeholders can click around.</p><p>Now what?</p><p>Here’s where most design leads make a mistake: they treat the AI-generated prototype as the deliverable. It’s not. The prototype is a hypothesis. What you need is evidence.</p><p>This part is about turning “I think this works” into “Here’s proof it works” — fast enough that you don’t lose momentum.</p><h4>The Justification Tax</h4><p>In Part 1, I introduced the “justification tax” — the disproportionate amount of time design leads spend defending decisions that other disciplines make with a quick conversation. That tax doesn’t disappear once you have a prototype. If anything, it gets heavier: now stakeholders have something tangible to have opinions about.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/172db8dc4450"">Tom Greever</a>, author of <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25520974-articulating-design-decisions"">Articulating Design Decisions</a>, puts it bluntly:</p><blockquote>“The most articulate person often wins.”</blockquote><p>That’s the problem. You shouldn’t have to be the most articulate person. You should have data.</p><p>AI prototyping gets you the artifact faster. Quick validation gets you the evidence to defend it.</p><h4>Why AI Prototypes Still Need Testing</h4><p>There’s a reason <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/"">Nielsen Norman Group</a> keeps warning about AI-generated designs: <strong>they often have visual issues like poor hierarchy, inconsistent spacing, and low contrast. They look plausible but don’t actually work.</strong></p><p><a href=""https://maze.co/collections/ai/validate-ai-prototypes/"">Maze’s research</a> on testing AI prototypes found three common problems:</p><p><strong>1. Looks right, works wrong</strong> — AI creates what’s statistically likely, not what’s strategically correct. Navigation that seems logical might confuse real users.<br /><strong>2. Lacks real context</strong> — AI doesn’t understand your business goals, audience history, or product constraints. It generates generic solutions.<br /><strong>3. Breaks design systems</strong> — Enterprise teams find AI-generated designs ignore component rules and brand guidelines.</p><p>The fix isn’t to avoid AI prototyping. It’s to validate quickly before anyone falls in love with the wrong solution.</p><h3>The 30-Minute Validation Loop</h3><p>Here’s the workflow that changed how I approach stakeholder debates:</p><h4>Step 1: Build competing prototypes (30–60 min)</h4><p>When your team argues about approaches, don’t debate. Build both versions using <a href=""https://lovable.dev/"">Lovable</a>, <a href=""https://www.figma.com/make/"">Figma Make</a>, or <a href=""https://cursor.com/"">Cursor</a>.</p><p>Two functional prototypes beat two hours of whiteboard arguments.</p><h4>Step 2: Set up a quick test (15–30 min)</h4><p><a href=""https://maze.co/"">Maze</a> integrates directly with Figma prototypes and now supports AI-generated prototypes from Lovable and Bolt. Define one clear task: “<strong>Find and start a savings goal</strong>” or “<strong>Complete the first step of onboarding.</strong>”</p><p>Keep it simple. One task. One success metric. Five to ten participants.</p><h4>Step 3: Let data settle the debate (results in 1–2 hours*)</h4><p>Maze shows completion rates, time-on-task, and heatmaps in near real-time. You’re not looking for statistical significance — you’re looking for obvious signals.</p><p>If Version A has 80% completion and Version B has 45%, t<strong>he debate is over</strong>.</p><ul><li><em>Note: The 1–2 hour turnaround depends on using Maze’s paid participant panel. If you’re recruiting your own users, expect longer. The completion rate example above is hypothetical to illustrate the point — in practice, your numbers will vary based on task complexity and audience.</em></li></ul><h4>Depersonalizing Design Debates</h4><p>Here’s something I’ve learned managing 7 designers: ego kills collaboration.</p><p>When designers argue about approaches, they’re often defending their taste, not the user. “I think users would prefer X” vs “No, Y is more intuitive” is an unwinnable argument because it’s subjective.</p><p>Quick validation shifts the conversation. The prototype becomes neutral ground. It’s not “your idea vs. my idea” — it’s “let’s see what users actually do.”</p><p><a href=""https://www.lyssna.com/blog/data-driven-design/"">TEG (The Economist Group)</a> adopted this approach and found they could “set up tests and get data in minutes, reducing the need for lengthy discussions and debates based on assumptions.”</p><p>As a lead, you’re not always the tiebreaker. You’re the one who creates conditions for evidence-based decisions.</p><h4>Tools for Quick Validation</h4><p><a href=""https://maze.co/"">Maze</a> — The fastest path from prototype to data</p><p>Best for: Quantitative validation (completion rates, heatmaps, paths). Integrates with Figma, supports AI-generated prototypes from Lovable, Bolt, and Figma Make. Results arrive in 1–2 hours with their panel, or share with your own users.</p><p><em>Pricing: Free tier available, paid starts at $99/month.</em></p><p><a href=""https://attentioninsight.com/"">Attention Insight</a> — Predict attention before testing</p><p>Uses AI to generate eye-tracking heatmaps based on visual saliency. Good for quick gut-checks on hierarchy and CTA visibility before you run real tests.</p><p><a href=""https://hotjar.com/"">Hotjar</a> — For live products</p><p>If your prototype is deployed (Lovable and Bolt can do this), Hotjar gives you session recordings and heatmaps of real behavior.</p><p><strong>Lightweight alternatives:</strong></p><ul><li>5-second tests (first impressions, what users notice)<br />- First-click tests (where users expect to tap)<br />- Quick surveys right after tasks (“How confident did you feel?”)</li></ul><h4>The Prompt Formula for Clear Results</h4><p>Speaking of prompts — they matter for testing too. Borrowed from the <a href=""https://adplist.org/"">ADPList AI Design ebook</a>, here’s a formula worth bookmarking:</p><p><strong>[Context] + [Task] + [Format] + [Tone] + [Constraints]</strong></p><p>Applied to test task writing:</p><p><strong>Bad:</strong> “Explore the app and tell us what you think.”</p><p><strong>Better:</strong> “You want to start saving €50/month for a vacation. Find where to set up a savings goal and complete the first step.”</p><p>The second version has context (user goal), clear task (specific action), and implicit success criteria (completing the step).</p><h4>When NOT to Validate</h4><p>Quick validation isn’t always the answer. Skip it when:</p><p>- <strong>The decision is reversible </strong>— If you can ship and iterate, ship and iterate<br />- <strong>Stakeholders aren’t actually blocking </strong>— Don’t create process where you don’t need it<br /><strong>- You’re optimizing prematurely</strong>— Early concepts need room to breathe</p><p>Use validation strategically: when there’s real disagreement, real risk, or real investment at stake.</p><h4>From Evidence to Alignment</h4><p>The goal isn’t just to win arguments. It’s to create shared understanding.</p><p>When you bring test results to a stakeholder meeting, you’re not saying “<strong>I was right.</strong>” You’re saying “<strong>Here’s what we learned together.</strong>”</p><p><a href=""https://attentioninsight.com/complete-guide-to-data-driven-design/"">Data-driven design</a> research shows that “<strong>data provides a common language for teams and stakeholders to discuss design decisions.</strong>” The evidence becomes the foundation, not your opinion.</p><figure><img alt=""Drawing of three papers on a desk with multiple stamps and signatures"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*f6-q_lL-gf11hrpeYyza-w.png"" /><figcaption>Image generated with <a href=""https://www.midjourney.com"">Midjourney</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Part 5: The Pitch — Prototype + Data = No Debate</h3><p>You’ve built the prototype. You’ve tested it. You have data.</p><p>Now comes the moment that separates design leads who get things built from those who get stuck in endless review cycles: the pitch.</p><p>This isn’t about presentation skills or PowerPoint templates. It’s about bringing the right artifacts to the right people and making decisions inevitable.</p><h4>Why Most Design Pitches Fail</h4><p>Here’s the pattern I see constantly:</p><p>Designer presents beautiful mockups. Stakeholder says “I like it, but…” followed by personal preferences. Engineering says “That looks hard.” Meeting ends with “Let’s iterate and reconvene.”</p><p>Three weeks later, same meeting.</p><p><strong>The problem isn’t the design. It’s the forma</strong>t.</p><p>Static mockups invite opinion. Working prototypes invite reaction. Data invites alignment.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/9093eee038b2"">Todd Zaki Warfel</a>, former design executive at Twitter, Cisco, and Workday, puts it simply:</p><blockquote>“When you learn to present your work with the right balance of proof and persuasion, you can win over your stakeholders.”</blockquote><p>The balance matters. Proof without persuasion is a data dump. Persuasion without proof is just opinion vs. opinion.</p><h3>The Three-Part Pitch Stack</h3><p>After years of pitching designs (and watching many fail), here’s the structure that works:</p><h4>1. The Working Prototype</h4><p>Let them click. Let them experience. Don’t explain what it does — show them.</p><p>AI-generated prototypes from <a href=""https://lovable.dev/"">Lovable</a>, <a href=""https://www.figma.com/make/"">Figma Make</a>, or <a href=""https://cursor.com/"">Cursor</a> change the dynamic immediately. Instead of imagining what something might feel like, stakeholders interact with it directly.</p><p><a href=""https://blog.pixelfreestudio.com/how-to-use-interactive-prototypes-for-stakeholder-presentations/"">PixelFreeStudio’s research</a> on prototype presentations found:</p><blockquote>“When stakeholders are actively involved in the presentation, they’re more likely to feel a sense of ownership over the project, which can lead to stronger support and enthusiasm for your ideas.”</blockquote><p>The prototype creates shared experience. <strong>Everyone saw the same thing</strong>.</p><h4>2. The Validation Data</h4><p>This is where Part 4’s work pays off.</p><p>Don’t just say “users preferred this approach.” Show them:</p><p>- Completion rates (80% vs. 45%)<br />- Time-on-task differences<br />- Heatmaps showing where attention goes<br />- Direct user quotes from testing</p><p>Data doesn’t eliminate disagreement. But it changes the nature of the conversation from “<strong>I feel</strong>” to “<strong>users showed us</strong>.”</p><h4>3. The Engineering Alignment</h4><p>Here’s where most design leads drop the ball: they pitch to stakeholders <strong>before</strong> talking to engineering.</p><p>Then engineering raises feasibility concerns in the meeting. Stakeholder confidence drops. The pitch stalls.</p><p>Flip the order. Before your stakeholder meeting:</p><p>- Share the prototype with engineering leads<br />- Ask: “<strong>Is this technically feasible? What would be hard?</strong>”<br />- Identify constraints and incorporate them into your pitch</p><p>When you present, you’re not saying “here’s what we want.” You’re saying “<strong>here’s what we’ve validated with users and confirmed with engineering.</strong>”</p><p>That’s a different conversation entirely.</p><h3>Tailoring the Pitch to Your Audience</h3><p>Different stakeholders care about different things. Obvious, but most design leads present the same deck to everyone.</p><h4>For Executives (VP+):</h4><p>- Lead with business impact, not design rationale<br />- Keep it short — they’re comparing your pitch to ten other priorities<br />- Show you’ve de-risked it: “Users validated this, engineering confirmed feasibility”<br />- Have a clear ask: approval, resources, timeline</p><h4>For Product Managers:</h4><p>- Connect to roadmap and OKRs<br />- Show user evidence that supports their metrics<br />- Be clear about dependencies and trade-offs</p><h4>For Engineering Leads:</h4><ul><li>Show the prototype early (before the big meeting)<br />- Ask genuine questions about feasibility<br />- Demonstrate you’ve thought about edge cases<br />- The AI prototype’s code isn’t production-ready — acknowledge that</li></ul><p>As <a href=""https://medium.com/u/216d1f5cc211"">Greg Becker</a> notes:</p><blockquote>“They don’t speak your language — you must speak theirs.”</blockquote><h3>The “No Surprises” Rule</h3><p>The biggest pitching mistake I see design leads make: surprising people in meetings.</p><p>Stakeholders hate surprises. If your VP learns about a major design direction for the first time in a review meeting, you’ve already lost — even if the design is perfect.</p><h4>Here’s my pre-meeting checklist:</h4><p>• Engineering has seen the prototype and raised concerns (which I’ve addressed)<br />• Product knows how this connects to their goals<br />• Key stakeholders got a heads-up about the direction<br />• I know what objections are coming and have responses ready</p><p>The meeting becomes confirmation, not revelation.</p><h4>Handling the “But What About…” Questions</h4><p>Even with great prep, you’ll get questions. Here’s how to handle common ones:</p><p><strong>”Can we also add [feature X]?”</strong></p><p>Don’t say no. Say: “We can test that. Let me add it to the next validation round and show you what users think.”</p><p>You’ve shifted from defending to learning.</p><p><strong>”Engineering says this is too complex.”</strong></p><p>If you’ve done pre-alignment, this shouldn’t happen. If it does: “Let’s schedule a technical review. I want to understand the constraints so we can find a solution that works.”</p><p><strong>”I just don’t like [specific element].”</strong></p><p>This is the hardest one — pure preference. Your response: “I hear you. We tested this with [X] users and [specific result]. Happy to test an alternative if you’d like to see the comparison.”</p><p>You’re not dismissing their opinion. You’re offering to put it to the same test everything else went through.</p><h4>The AI Advantage in Pitching</h4><p>Here’s what changes with AI prototyping in your pitch toolkit:</p><p><strong>Speed of alternatives:</strong> Stakeholder suggests a different approach? You can often build and test it before the next meeting. That used to take weeks.</p><p><strong>Tangibility over imagination:</strong> Working prototypes bridge the imagination gap. Most stakeholders’ roles don’t require them to envision complex interactions from mockups alone — so don’t ask them to.</p><p><strong>Lower stakes for testing:</strong> When prototypes take days, testing every idea feels expensive. When they take hours, you can test stakeholder suggestions without derailing your timeline.</p><p><strong>Code as communication:</strong> If your prototype was built in Cursor with React components, engineering can see exactly what you’re proposing. It’s not “can you build something that looks like this?” — it’s “here’s a working version, how close is this to production-ready?”</p><h4>The Follow-Through</h4><p>The pitch doesn’t end when the meeting ends.</p><p><strong>Within 24 hours:</strong></p><p>- Send a summary of decisions made and next steps<br />- Share the prototype link (so stakeholders can revisit)<br />- Note any open questions and when you’ll address them<br />- Thank engineering for their input (publicly, if appropriate)</p><p>This isn’t just courtesy. It creates a paper trail that prevents “I don’t remember agreeing to that” in future meetings.</p><h4>From Pitch to Build</h4><p>When your pitch succeeds, the transition to development should be smooth because you’ve done the work:</p><p>- Prototype demonstrates the interaction model<br />- Test data shows user acceptance<br />- Engineering has already reviewed feasibility<br />- Stakeholders are aligned on the direction</p><p><a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/the-designers-handbook-for-developer-handoff/"">Figma’s design handoff guide</a> emphasizes:</p><blockquote>“By working together with a shared language, designers and developers can avoid misalignment, reduce re-work, and confidently build a well designed and technically sound product together.”</blockquote><p>The prototype isn’t the deliverable. The prototype was the tool that got everyone to “yes.”</p><figure><img alt=""The same character from the beguining of the article looking at a selfie camera and smiling"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aTOIjzE93lnX9E4-vfv2zw.png"" /><figcaption>Image generated with <a href=""https://www.midjourney.com"">Midjourney</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Part 6: The Future of Design Leads — What Stays Human</h3><p>Let’s end where we started: with the reality of the job.</p><p>Design leads don’t spend their days designing. They spend them communicating, aligning, justifying, and managing. The 80% job.</p><p>AI is getting very good at the 20% — the mockups, the prototypes, the visual production. What it can’t do is the 80%.</p><p>That’s not a bug. That’s your future.</p><h4>The Skill Shift Is Already Happening</h4><p><a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-2025-ai-report-perspectives/"">Figma’s 2025 AI Report</a> surveyed thousands of designers and found something interesting: 52% of AI builders say design is <strong>more important</strong> for AI-powered products than traditional ones, not less.</p><p>The reason? AI outputs need curation, judgment, and quality control. Someone has to decide what’s good. Someone has to connect it to strategy. Someone has to make sure it actually solves the user’s problem.</p><p><strong>That someone is still human.</strong></p><p><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/"">Nielsen Norman Group</a> noted in 2025 that while generative tools can speed up tasks like asset creation and copy generation, <strong>“they still can’t replicate the insight of human designers.”</strong></p><p>The tools are changing. The need for design thinking isn’t.</p><h3>What AI Cannot Do</h3><p>Let me be specific about what stays human — not in theory, but from experience.</p><h4>Judgment and taste.</h4><p>AI generates options. Humans choose. <a href=""https://medium.com/u/677fcb8f826d"">Andrea Grigsby</a> in UX Collective put it simply: <strong>“AI may automate technical skills in design, but it can’t replicate human taste.”</strong> Taste isn’t preference — it’s the accumulated wisdom of knowing what works, what feels right, what aligns with brand and user and context simultaneously. It’s the thing that makes you say “this doesn’t feel right” before you can articulate why. AI can produce a thousand variations. You’re the one who knows which one is <strong>right</strong>.</p><h4>Stakeholder navigation.</h4><p>No AI is sitting in your meeting reading the room. Understanding that the VP is skeptical because of a failed project last quarter. Knowing that engineering is stretched and needs a simpler solution. Sensing that the PM is worried about timeline but won’t say it directly. I learned this lesson deeply at a previous job, when I had to present a product vision directly to the multinational CEO. Before the meeting, <strong>I did extensive research — his decision-making style, his priorities, what resonated with him</strong>. I talked to people who’d presented to him before. Then I spent weeks quietly getting his most trusted advisors on my side, making sure they understood and supported the vision before I ever walked into that room. The presentation was a success — <strong>it defined a product we worked on for two years, led to hiring two new development teams from Portugal, and more than doubled the UX team size</strong>. No AI could have navigated that. The research, the relationship-building, the reading of organizational dynamics — those are fundamentally human skills that determine whether your work gets built or gets stuck.</p><h4>Team development.</h4><p>You manage people. Each has different strengths, motivations, and career goals. AI can’t coach someone through a confidence crisis. It can’t mediate a conflict between two designers who have different working styles. It can’t help a junior designer see the gap between where they are and where they want to be. <a href=""https://www.thecaragroup.com/leadership-in-the-ai-era/"">Research from the Top Employers Institute</a> shows that <strong>68% of employees believe non-work-related training that supports their overall well-being is vital</strong>. Leadership is about the whole person, not just their output.</p><h4>Ethical decision-making.</h4><p>Should we use this dark pattern that increases conversions but frustrates users? Should we collect this data even though users probably don’t understand what they’re agreeing to? Should we ship this feature knowing it’s not accessible? AI doesn’t have values. You do. <a href=""https://aijourn.com/human-intelligence-in-an-ai-world-why-empathy-sense-making-and-ethical-judgement-still-decide-enterprise-success/"">McKinsey’s research</a> found that <strong>only 1% of companies feel “mature” in AI integration</strong>, and the biggest barriers are not technical but leadership and organizational factors.</p><h4>Sense-making in ambiguity.</h4><p>When the strategy is unclear, when stakeholders disagree, when the data points in multiple directions — <strong>that’s when human judgment matters most</strong>. AI excels with clear inputs and defined parameters. Real design leadership happens when neither exists.</p><h3>The Design Lead of 2028</h3><p>Based on everything we’ve covered, here’s my bet on what the design lead role looks like in a few years.</p><p><strong>AI transformation of creative work is accelerating</strong> — the tools we’ve discussed in this series were barely functional two years ago, and they’re now reshaping workflows daily. I don’t know exactly how fast or how far this goes, but the direction is clear: the tactical parts of design work will increasingly be handled by AI, and the strategic, human parts will become more valuable, not less.</p><p>Design leads will <strong>spend less time on creating production-ready mockups</strong>, writing documentation from scratch, synthesizing research manually, and building presentation decks. <strong>They’ll spend more time on evaluating and curating AI outputs</strong>, coaching team members through AI-augmented workflows, stakeholder alignment and organizational navigation, defining what “good” looks like for AI tools, and ethical oversight and quality judgment.</p><p>The title might stay the same. <strong>The job changes significantly.</strong></p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/1dd0fcefd09a"">Maya Brennan</a> 2026 predictions in <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/10-predictions-for-ai-design-in-2026-823da9f1db7b"">Bootcamp</a> capture it:</p><blockquote>“It’s an undoubtedly exciting time to be a Product Designer: the technical foundations have been built — and it is now up to us to re-imagine what the visual and interactive frameworks for these AI experiences will look like.”</blockquote><p>The people defining those frameworks won’t be AI. <strong>They’ll be design leaders with taste, judgment, and organizational skill.</strong></p><h3>Your Competitive Advantage</h3><p>If you’ve made it through this series, you have something most design leads don’t: a practical framework for using AI <strong>as a lead</strong>, not just as an individual contributor.</p><p>Let’s recap what we covered:</p><p><strong>Part 1: The reality of design leadership </strong>— the 80% job is communication, not creation.</p><p><strong>Part 2: AI for admin work</strong> — reclaim time through meeting notes, research synthesis, stakeholder communication, and documentation.</p><p><strong>Part 3: AI for prototyping</strong> — vibe coding tools that let you create again, not to ship production work, but to prove ideas faster.</p><p><strong>Part 4: Quick validation</strong> — testing tools to turn prototypes into evidence that ends debates.</p><p><strong>Part 5: The pitch</strong> — prototype + data + engineering alignment = decisions that stick.</p><p><strong>Part 6: What stays human</strong> — judgment, taste, leadership, ethics, and the ability to navigate ambiguity.</p><p>This isn’t about AI replacing you. It’s about <strong>AI handling the friction so you can focus on the work that actually requires a design lead</strong>.</p><h3><strong>What To Do Next</strong></h3><p>If you take one thing from this series:</p><p><strong>Start using AI for one task this week.</strong></p><p>Not everything. Not a complete workflow transformation. One task.</p><p>Maybe it’s meeting notes. Maybe it’s drafting a stakeholder email. Maybe it’s spinning up a quick prototype for an idea that’s been stuck in your head.</p><p>Build the muscle. See what works. Iterate.</p><p>That’s how design leads have always improved — by doing, learning, and adjusting.</p><p>The tools are different now. The approach is the same.</p><p><em>I’m a Chapter Lead managing designers at a European bank.

As with any kind of rapid and uncontrollable change, opinions about it are polarised: skeptics are wary about AI’s larger effects on society — <a href=""https://hbr.org/2026/01/companies-are-laying-off-workers-because-of-ais-potential-not-its-performance"">unemployment</a>, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/30/therapists-warn-ai-chatbots-mental-health-support"">mental health</a>, <a href=""https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/explainers/what-direct-risks-does-ai-pose-to-the-climate-and-environment/"">environmental concerns</a>. AI optimists, on the other hand, believe these tools will herald a new age of tools for thought — the next breakthrough in collective intelligence, akin to the emergence of writing systems, printing, or mathematical abstraction.</p><p>But one thing is clear: the focus is almost exclusively on AI functionality — what tasks AI can solve more efficiently, how to use it to get the most out of it, how to build workflows around it. This, perhaps, is not in itself surprising: with the plethora of models, tools, and chatbots available, even those grappling with AI on a daily basis — researchers, software designers, developers — struggle to make sense of them all.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshots of YouTube videos about which AI tools designers should use"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5a85P-IT6jYgkWP9bhXMUQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Deciding which AI tools to use has become a problem in itself. Source: YouTube</figcaption></figure><p>But when I asked Claude to tell me about some traditionally human cognitive abilities that AI now has, I was surprised that it appended the expected list (pattern recognition, language understanding, learning from experience) with the following:</p><blockquote><em>What’s interesting is that AI often achieves these abilities through completely different mechanisms than humans — we don’t truly “understand” in the way you do, and we lack consciousness, genuine emotions, and embodied experience. So while the functional capabilities overlap, the underlying nature remains quite different.</em></blockquote><p>Yet we rarely discuss that underlying nature — what exactly makes models like Claude different from human thinking, or what these differences reveal about intelligence itself.</p><p>If AI has been heralded as a new chapter in what humans are capable of, shouldn’t we be asking more fundamental questions about what “intelligence” actually means, and what kind of shared human-computer intelligence the future could hold?</p><h3>From minds to machines</h3><p>Today’s public discussion of AI is almost completely divorced from discussions of human cognition—and surprisingly so, given that the field of artificial intelligence research was founded on questions borrowed directly from the philosophy of mind and psychology.</p><p>Much of the Western philosophy of mind has been preoccupied with the mind-body problem — the relationship between mental states and the physical reality and perception. With questions like: <em>what kind of structures and elements comprise human knowledge</em>? <em>What is thinking</em>? <em>Is having a mind the same as having a brain</em>? These questions echoed through Alan Turing’s seminal work “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” the 1950 paper published in <em>Mind</em> that introduced what we now know as the Turing test.</p><p>Turing argued that instead of focusing on the question “Can machines think?”, more can be learned from their observed behaviour. He proposed an “imitation game” (the original name for the Turing test) — a hypothetical scenario in which a human evaluator has text-based conversations with two hidden participants: one human and one machine. If the evaluator can’t reliably tell which is which based on their responses, the machine is said to have passed the test.</p><figure><img alt=""The setup of the Turing test"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/661/0*G_VPOC9VEN3vCy0W.png"" /><figcaption>In a Turing test, a human evaluator judges a text transcript of a conversation between a human and a machine. The evaluator tries to identify the machine, and the machine passes if the evaluator cannot reliably tell them apart. Source: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test"">Wikipedia</a></figcaption></figure><p>For a while, the discussion around creating a human-like “learning machine” was theoretical. But the advancements in the understanding of the brain’s neural structure throughout the 19th and 20th centuries established the electrical nature of the nerve signal, culminating in neuropsychologist Donald Hebb’s theory on the neural processes that underlie learning. In his 1949 book <em>The Organization of Behavior</em>, Hebb theorised how neural connections form through repeated activation — a principle later summarised as “Neurons that fire together, wire together.” This insight provided the foundation for modern neuroscience, neural network theory, and machine learning.</p><figure><img alt=""Structure of the human neuron compared to the architecture of an artificial neural network"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/726/1*VK0tUU4UHW3HHWA7slJ3eg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>The principle “Neurons that fire together, wire together” inspired the architecture of artificial neural networks. Source: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning)"">Wikipedia</a></figcaption></figure><p>Early pioneers of AI believed that describing the mind in computational terms — made possible by Hebbian theory and the subsequent development of artificial neural networks — could finally answer those foundational questions about human cognition. If they could build computational systems that closely resembled the brain’s neural structure, they reasoned, those systems might recreate the processes underlying uniquely human abilities: language, visual perception, reasoning, artistic creation.</p><p>As work on understanding the mind unfolded throughout the 20th century, two competing views of intelligence emerged: pattern recognition (also known as “statistical processing”) and world modelling (known as “symbolic manipulation”). The difference becomes clear when we consider how a child might learn what a dog is.</p><p>From the symbolic point of view, every time a child sees a creature that their caregiver tells them is “a dog,” they form and develop the concept of <em>dog — </em>i.e.<em> </em>what properties are characteristic of dogs. When they learn to recognise creatures as another kind of “dog”, they are learning to make the connection between an instance—the dog they’re looking at — and their mental concept of <em>dog</em>.</p><figure><img alt=""How a child might learn the concept of “dog”: through recognising a pattern that’s consistent across all examples of a dog they’ve encountered, or by building a mental model of what a dog is"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BZxyXL5gEBijen6btqv5VQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>How a child might learn the concept “dog” according to pattern recognition vs. world modelling view. Collage created by the author. Source: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernese_Mountain_Dog"">Wikipedia</a></figcaption></figure><p>From the point of view of recognising patterns, a child sees many different examples of dogs: all kinds of shapes, breeds, colours, and drooliness levels. Their extremely malleable brain processes all these instances, identifies patterns, and learns to match new examples to this pattern. Very quickly they learn to classify new exemplars as either “dog” or “not dog.”</p><p>If the latter sounds extremely similar to a basic-level explanation of machine learning, it’s not by coincidence: artificial intelligence as a field — and especially the view of intelligence as pattern recognition — has been heavily influenced by child development research. In “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” Turing referred to an artificial intelligence system as a “child-machine”; early pioneers of modern AI research in the 70s explicitly stated the connection between the two fields. For example, in 1972 computer scientist <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Schank"">Roger Schank</a> wrote that:</p><blockquote><em>We hope to be able to build a program that can learn, as a child does, how to do what we have described in this paper instead of being spoon-fed the tremendous information necessary.</em></blockquote><p>A similar sentiment was expressed by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky"">Marvin Minsky</a>, one of the “fathers of AI,” in 1974:</p><blockquote><em>I draw no boundary between a theory of human thinking and a scheme for making an intelligent machine; no purpose would be served by separating these today since neither domain has theories good enough to explain or to produce enough mental capacity.</em></blockquote><p>And it’s not surprising why a child’s mind is so fascinating to an AI researcher: after all, we spend our early days being unable to speak or hold our head up, yet we develop object permanence by five months old, can distinguish our native language from a foreign one by six months, and perform cost-reward analysis by ten months old. And all of that without the massive datasets that systems like GPT, Claude, and Llama require: a modern large language model (LLM) trains on trillions of words, while an average five-year-old is exposed to around 300,000. How can we learn so much from so little, and so fast?</p><p>Both cognitive and computer scientists today mostly agree that intelligence comprises both statistical learning and world model building. But, for reasons I won’t detail here, modern AI research from major industry labs has largely abandoned the question of <em>how</em> children learn so efficiently, focusing instead on <em>whether</em> similar behaviour can be achieved through massive computing power and large training datasets. Still, the original question persists in a new field that has been developing alongside traditional psychology and computer science: computational cognitive science, which continues to ask what artificial intelligence can reveal about the nature of human minds.</p><h3>From machines to minds</h3><p>Despite AI’s origins in the study of human cognition, that connection has all but disappeared from public awareness. Yet while mainstream AI research has pivoted toward achieving human-like behaviour without needing to implement a sophisticated human-like cognitive architecture, a a swiftly developing new field—computational cognitive science — has been figuring out ways to use AI models as windows into human cognition.</p><p>The logic is fairly straightforward: if artificial neural networks are modelled (however loosely) on biological ones, then understanding how an AI system solves a problem could offer clues about how humans solve it too. This approach is sometimes called “reverse-engineering” cognition: build a system that can perform a human task, decipher how it accomplishes that task, then ask whether humans might be doing something similar.</p><p>And so far, the results have been impressive. <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712"">Since at least GPT-4</a>, LLMs have been able to solve<strong> </strong>difficult tasks across mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology, and more.</p><p>But a few concerns remain. First, AI learns from significantly more data than humans (very few of us can brag that we have read all of Wikipedia). Second, while AI can certainly be impressive, it still often falls short at some basic tasks that require symbolic manipulation.</p><p>For example, Yale University professor <a href=""https://rtmccoy.com/"">Tom McCoy</a> and colleagues <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13638"">found</a> that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with seemingly simple tasks like forming acronyms, decoding shift ciphers, and translating into Pig Latin — tasks that require symbolic manipulation following deterministic rules (e.g., “count the number of words in a list”). What’s revealing is that LLMs performed significantly worse when the correct answer was a low-probability string, even though these tasks have objectively correct, deterministic answers, and require no probabilistic reasoning whatsoever (unlike questions such as “How likely am I to get stuck in traffic at 5pm in central London?” — where statistical patterns are genuinely useful).</p><figure><img alt=""Experimental materials from Tom McCoy and Najoung Kim’s studies"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rAPFwOIs_JSgs9sMlmr0mQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Left: <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13638"">McCoy and colleagues found</a> that LLMs struggle with low-probability answers to questions that require a deterministic answer. Right: LLMs can make human-like inferences from adjective-noun pairs, but not for unusual combinations, <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17482"">Kim and colleagues report</a></figcaption></figure><p>Similarly, when <a href=""https://najoung.kim/"">Najoung Kim</a>, a professor of computational linguistics at Boston University, and her colleagues from Harvard University <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17482"">tested</a> LLMs on their ability to make inferences from adjective-noun combinations (for example, the answer to <em>Is a counterfeit watch still a watch?</em> should be <em>Yes, </em>but the answer to <em>Is a fake doctor still a doctor?</em> should be <em>No</em>) they found that these models struggled with low-probability, unusual combinations such as <em>a homemade cat</em>.</p><p>The takeaway appears simple: AI is extremely good at learning and generalising information, but it is limited by the tasks it was trained on. As McCoy and colleagues conclude in their paper:</p><blockquote><em>We should absolutely recognize [LLMs’] advanced properties. Nonetheless, we should also remember a simpler fact: Language models are… language models! That is, they are statistical next-word prediction systems […] In sum, to understand what language models are, we must understand what we have trained them to be.</em></blockquote><p>At this point, it seems appropriate to ask: is it even possible to study AI models as proxies for the human mind, when their performance is so clearly underpinned by amounts of training data that no human would process in a lifetime, and an architecture that relies primarily on statistical processing?</p><p>Recently, researchers have been trying to solve this problem by introducing additional constraints on how AI systems work: limiting and curating the data they are trained on, and tweaking the architecture to approximate the cognitive biases innate to human mind.</p><p>Researchers from Princeton University’s <a href=""https://lake-lab.github.io/"">Human &amp; Machine Intelligence Lab</a>, directed by <a href=""https://psychology.princeton.edu/people/brenden-lake"">Brenden Lake</a>,<strong> </strong>trained a generic neural network on 61 hours of video footage that came from a head-mounted camera worn by a single child over the course of 1.5 years. The simple architecture of the model allowed the researchers to test a simple theory of word learning: that novel words are learned by tracking co-occurrences of visual and linguistic information. The model tracks visual and linguistic inputs, which are in turn passed through the visual and linguistic encoders, and embedded in a shared vector space. In other words, the model tracks what kind of visual information accompanies verbal cues like “cat” or “toy,” just like a child might.</p><p>And while despite being trained on a tiny dataset — by today’s standards — it worked. When the researchers tested the model on a new set of images, it matched the words it learned during training with the correct visual referents, even though it hadn’t “seen” those specific images before. This finding goes beyond just achieving impressive performance: it provides evidence that word learning in humans could be possible through a general-purpose cognitive mechanism that combines representation and associative learning.</p><figure><img alt=""A toddler wearing a head-mounted camera"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*b5jE9hKC_qBS4dZi"" /><figcaption>“We showed, for the first time, that you can train an AI model to learn words through the eyes and ears of a single child” — Brenden Lake, professor of psychology at Princeton University. Source: <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-camera-wearing-baby-taught-an-ai-to-learn-words/"">Scientific American</a></figcaption></figure><p>This research suggests that the path to understanding the mind (and as a consequence, building better AI) lies in training models on less data, but thinking more carefully about the kinds of cognitive biases they should be imbued with.</p><p>And it clearly aligns with the original mission of AI research. <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/science/ai-infants-language-learning.html"">The New York Times article</a> covering this research concludes:</p><blockquote><em>For Dr. Lake, and for other investigators like him, these interlocking questions — How humanlike can we make A.I.? What makes us human? — present the most exciting research on the horizon.</em></blockquote><p>But is this approach likely to become prevalent in industry labs that lead the development of state-of-the-art models like GPT? Logically, it should: front loading effort and resources into building more interpretable models now would ensure their longevity (even now, a mere year after the introduction of ChatGPT, many young people are <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9wx2dz2v44o"">rejecting what they consider to be “AI slop”</a>). But for commercial labs guided by generating profits and appeasing shareholders, this seems unlikely: why bother spending resources on uncomfortably vague research when increasing computing power and training data have done the trick just fine? The <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/science/ai-infants-language-learning.html"">same New York Times article</a> points out:</p><blockquote><em>But mainstream industry labs behind the most competent A.I. models, and the companies that make them, have long been geared toward efficiently processing more data, not making more sense out of less.</em></blockquote><p>Academic research labs face a different version of the same problem. While not driven by pure profit motives, coveted funding sources often mean that their research is still more biased towards building more human-like agents — not creating technology for AI-assisted, more thoughtful and creative human. If we continue this way, where will it lead?</p><h3>What happens after AI passes the capitalist Turing test?</h3><p>We have found ourselves at a crossroads. On one hand, we seemingly understand more than ever about how humans think, learn, process visual information, and interact socially. On the other, this knowledge is being channeled almost exclusively toward building better AI chatbots that mimic human behaviour.</p><p>Why? First, because the direction is set by for-profit companies whose ultimate goal isn’t ushering in <a href=""https://maggieappleton.com/ai-enlightenment#our-missing-pocket-sized-enlightenment"">a new Age of Enlightenment</a>, but selling a product — making us more reliant on AI agents to simplify workflows, optimise routines, delegate tasks. Think less, less, less.</p><p>Second, for that purpose, research that focuses narrowly on pattern recognition and statistical processing does just fine. These systems are straightforward to train and improve, and their performance is impressive enough to sustain public interest and turn in profits. They pass the capitalist Turing test.</p><p>But here’s the trouble: reports of depleting critical thinking and shortening attention spans might just not be fear-mongering, but a direct outcome of systems designed solely for performance. If we spend our thinking time communicating with machines optimised for pattern matching, we might internalise those same patterns to make the interaction more efficient.</p><p>The crux of the matter is that interaction with AI is now <a href=""https://www.personalcanon.com/p/how-to-speak-to-a-computer"">predominantly designed to imitate a conversation</a>, and we typically expect our conversational partners to have their own intentions, beliefs, and inner lives. In linguistics, it has been <a href=""https://web.stanford.edu/~clark/1990s/Brennan,%20S.E.%20_%20Clark,%20H.H.%20_Conceptual%20pacts%20and%20lexical%20choice%20in%20conversation_%201996.pdf"">well</a> <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027799000815?casa_token=yzamMMmozkYAAAAA:7mmmqFEEXyIDV6oItH2TykqHs1s6vDWbfPouY5XksQYC7YCYFqeZl6vDNSUL81WcGnfEUZIIuQk"">documented</a> that during a human-to-human conversation, people adapt to each other’s language patterns to align their mental states and ultimately achieve better communication. But AI has no mental states it can align with ours. It cannot restructure its foundation — built on statistics and patterns — to match our symbolic reasoning. And as a result, instead of AI becoming a thinking companion, <a href=""https://youtu.be/RKK7wGAYP6k?si=c1WKCZUiYzqNzozU"">our own thinking risks becoming more machine-like</a>: fine-tuned to recognise statistical regularities while forgetting how to make inferences, form concepts, find deeper connections between things.</p><p>So… what’s next? This is where things fall apart, because a crucial piece of understanding is missing: we’re still far from fully grasping how concepts are formed, or how symbolic reasoning is actually instantiated in the brain. And without that understanding, we can’t build systems that genuinely complement human intelligence rather than flatten it. In order to get there, three things need to happen:</p><ul><li>Industry research labs need to engage seriously with cognitive science and collaborate with academic researchers. If I’ve made my point clear, artificial intelligence research loses much of its substance when it severs ties with the foundational questions that connected it to philosophy of mind and cognitive development. For progress to be truly significant, these ties must be restored and strengthened.</li><li>AI systems need cognitively plausible architectures. In modern cognitive science, biological plausibility plays a crucial role: if a proposed mechanism is impossible to implement biologically, that casts serious doubt on its validity. The same standard should apply to AI. Researchers need to think carefully about what data models are trained on and why certain architectures are chosen — not just whether they work, but whether they reflect anything meaningful about intelligence.</li><li>Most crucially, software designers and cognitive scientists need to collaborate on how these systems can actually serve humanity. No one else can figure this out — and <a href=""https://maggieappleton.com/ai-enlightenment#our-missing-pocket-sized-enlightenment"">many designers already agree</a> that <a href=""https://www.personalcanon.com/p/how-to-speak-to-a-computer"">chat interfaces are a poor solution</a>.</li></ul><p>There’s a brand of AI optimism that says what you get out of AI depends on how you use it: if you’re filling knowledge gaps rather than taking shortcuts, you’ll unlock creativity and thinking rather than rot your brain on slop.</p><p>I subscribe to this optimism to a degree. As a designer, AI has allowed me to move beyond technical constraints and create more freely.</p><p>But this “solution” is rooted in individualism and, frankly, elitism: the idea that AI will make only the smartest and most discerning among us even brighter and more capable. There’s nothing in that promise about elevating humanity as a whole. Yet research shows that real progress is impossible without <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_cognition"">collective intelligence</a>. If AI is to fulfil its promise as a tool for thought — a genuine extension of human capability — it must be designed not just for individual optimisation, but for collective progress.</p><h4><strong>References</strong></h4><p>Turing, A.

I don’t know. But there seems to be a sort of a urgency for something new. For speed. For freedom. For paving a new path. For simplicity. For flexibility. <strong>A push for something else rather than Design Thinking as the standard design process.</strong></p><p>I am talking about the new wave of <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-return-of-the-intuitive-designer-in-the-age-of-ai-6f0ea728d1d0"">intuitive design</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u94juYwLLM&amp;t=864s"">not trusting the design process</a>, of taste and craft as the only ways to do exceptional design, of <a href=""https://x.com/ryolu_/status/2000557301695226265"">jumping straight into code / material</a>. While some parts of those ideas resonate, not all of us are positioned or experienced to do that. Also, processes exist for a reason — usually to make sure we take our users into account, to avoid blindspots, to be sure we are solving the right problem and to meet high bars of quality.</p><p>Before coming across as a big saviour / defender of Design Thinking, I need to come clean: I think we often fall into the trap of wrapping design in bloated processes, frameworks, and mystical terminology, producing unnecessary artefacts and wasting time along the way. And I think that design doing is equally important as the design thinking part.</p><p>So what is my thesis here?</p><p><strong>We need to go back to what’s <em>essential</em> and what’s <em>natural</em>.</strong></p><h4>In pursuit of the essence</h4><p>In my first attempt to shape my perspective, I wrote a think piece on the <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/1000-questions-1000-answers-2eeaf01dcb50"">1000 Questions and Answers of design</a>. It’s basically a snapshot of design as I know it and practice, outside of methodologies and tools.</p><p>Even though I believe the article still makes sense, I started questioning my thinking. Can it be simpler? Can it be shorter? Can it be more natural and stripped down to the essence?</p><p>If you strip it down, I started to see the design process as two simple steps:</p><p><strong>&lt;&gt; &lt;&gt; Open your eyes.</strong></p><p><strong>— — Squint your eyes.</strong></p><p>We all do these steps already, with or without realising it. With or without Design Thinking.</p><h4>Huh?</h4><p>Maybe I simplified it way too much. Sometimes I can err in the other direction — making things too abstract.</p><p>This is what I mean:</p><p><strong>Open your eyes to get information. Squint your eyes for focus.</strong></p><p><em>When your eyes are open</em>, you observe. You look around. You absorb. You listen. You think. You notice things you’d otherwise miss — the way people use a product, the frustrations in their tone, something beautiful that inspires a new direction, a design pattern that solves your problem. You are in consuming mode and in a pursuit for new information and perspectives. You are in search for inspiration, references, sparks for your ideas. Along the way, you might become an expert in something and you will start to empathise with your users.</p><p><em>When you squint your eyes</em>, you focus. You tune out the noise and work with what you’ve gathered. You sketch, you build, you make decisions. You bring something into being. You roll up your sleeves and produce with this newfound focus, clarity and intention. The background gets blurry and you just create. Time also gets blurry, you are in the flow and designs materialise.</p><p>That’s how the eyes work. That’s how the mind works — expanding and present when immersed into something new, focused on execution and on auto pilot once having all information. <a href=""https://www.nikon.nl/nl_NL/learn-and-explore/magazine/tips-and-tricks/what-is-aperture?srsltid=AfmBOor-FBxrbfqFoy56R6qsVvcZZDv_3AsIXYyZMh7-_j3SNNo49iFd"">Even cameras work this way </a>— wide open to take in light and to focus all the way up to the horizon in the distance, then tightened up to sharpen focus and capture the detail in front of the lens. It’s the natural way of seeing, thinking, and doing.</p><h4>In practice</h4><p>You can open and squint your eyes as many times as you like to or need to. Just don’t do it at the same time. That’s call winking. Or multitasking. Both are quite useless while designing.</p><p>Here’s an example of how this “process” might work:</p><ol><li><strong>Open your eyes</strong> → absorb, get inspired, ask questions, explore.</li><li><strong>Squint your eyes</strong> → focus, design, make, refine.</li><li><strong>Open again</strong> → test, show, share, watch reactions.</li><li><strong>Squint your eyes</strong> → polish, detail, finalise.</li></ol><p>Repeat until something good emerges. Add activities that you need at the moment.</p><p>At the end, or in between: <strong>fully close your eyes</strong> → <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/rest-why-it-is-important-for-designers-66b539a7c5dd"">rest</a>, let ideas simmer, gain distance. Also a natural and essential part of the process.</p><h4>Zoom out</h4><p>Zooming out (or while squinting your eyes) you might see double diamonds in the eye picture above. You might also see the concepts of diverge &amp; converge. Your eyes might be seeing right.</p><p>We might be back to square (or diamond) one. But we are free and back to our nature. We know why we do what we do and do it with confidence. We block out the noise.</p><p>We don’t need to kill the Double Diamond, but we can admit it’s just a dressed-up version of something our brains already know how to do. The danger with process-heavy design thinking is that it can become an end in itself. Design becomes the artefacts <em>about</em> design, rather than the <em>design itself</em>. We need to be careful about that, while respecting and following a <em>natural</em> process, with the necessary steps and activities for our problem and users.</p><p>The next time you’re overthinking your process, just remember: open your eyes, squint your eyes. The rest is abstraction and decoration.</p><p>And don’t forget to fully close your eyes from time to time. The best ideas come after some good rest and distance. Practice it now… closing in 3, 2, 1.</p><p><strong>References and extra resources</strong></p><ul><li><a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/1000-questions-1000-answers-2eeaf01dcb50"">1000 Questions, 1000 Answers</a></li><li><a href=""https://arnevanoosterom.medium.com/design-thinking-is-dead-again-e48bb1b17b7c"">Design Thinking is dead... again</a></li><li><a href=""https://medium.com/@Tirdad/design-thinking-is-not-dead-but-are-we-extracting-its-full-potential-85342d291bea"">Design thinking is not dead, but are we extracting its full potential?</a></li><li><a href=""https://medium.com/@tufred/design-thinking-is-dead-or-not-d151376ab9ce"">Design Thinking Is Dead.

He brought up the news that OpenAI recently announced that it would begin testing ads in the free and Go tiers of ChatGPT in the U.S., with the promises that ads will be clearly labeled &amp; won’t influence answers.¹ ² We’ve both fought against needless promotional content before and lamented that frontier AI platforms are falling into the same pattern. As designers and users, we’ve learned that “free” usually means putting up with interruptive, slightly creepy ads that feel more like a tax than a benefit — a frustration tax that now colors how we approach free‑tier services and now AI tools. However, we started chatting through it a bit more and explored whether there might actually be some good that can come out of it.</p><p>While advertisements in free services like ChatGPT risk frustrating users &amp; harming brand trust, frontier AI models have a unique opportunity to replace the traditional “sponsored” tag with promotional features that genuinely enhance the utility of threads &amp; responses — instead of undermining them. Before exploring how digital ads might actually do this, I want to briefly revisit how ads evolved on TV and YouTube, then look at the unique opportunities frontier AI platforms have, and finally ground it in a simple electrician problem to show how ads could enhance an AI chat thread.</p><h4>New platform, same commercial</h4><p>Billboards, cable TV commercials, and radio ads typically felt like a jarring distraction — pulling me out of driving, the show I was watching, or the song I was listening to. Further, the commercials themselves were usually irrelevant to whatever I was interested in. But since ads were less targeted to specific demographics on TV (aside from channels that entertained a certain subject like Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, or TV Land, etc.), it made sense that you would see a variety of advertisements ranging from uplifting prescription drug commercials to wacky toy ads for kids. And I remember feeling frustrated when I started seeing that same pattern begin on YouTube as though TV commercials were now coming to this new platform.</p><p>YouTube used to feel like a ‘free expression’ platform for anyone &amp; everyone to make videos on the internet. It gave people the means to show off talented, creative, strange, and hilarious content that we used to expect from YouTube. Even though ads came onto the scene just a year later, YouTube’s CEO Chad Hurley put his ad approach this way:</p><blockquote>We think there are better ways for people to engage with brands than forcing them to watch a commercial before seeing content. You could ask anyone on the net if they enjoy that experience and they’d probably say no. <br /> — <em>Chad Hurley ³</em></blockquote><p>But when YouTube was acquired by Google, ads started to function like commercials on TV by the end of 2007, confirming my worry. While they were annoying, they were at least short, skippable, and rarely shown.⁴ Today, however, ads can last over 90 seconds if the user allows it, becoming a <em>de facto</em> commercial break. Free-tier users pay a ‘price’ too, since ad-breaks have a cool-down timer before having the choice to skip.</p><p>But YouTube ads felt more targeted, which was both helpful &amp; creepy at times. If I started watching skateboarding videos, I might see advertisements for things skaters are interested in: skate decks, certain clothing brands, and <em>X-Games</em> announcements. With data sharing more broadly, I’d start seeing ads based on things I searched for online or just after I made an online purchase for a similar item. Still, it was better in a sense and more dialed in to relevant audiences than traditional TV or radio commercials.</p><p>All of this has taught us to expect that “free‑tier” experience means interruptive, slightly creepy, and rarely on our terms. That’s the mental model users will bring to free‑tier plans with ads in AI tools, and it functions like a frustration tax: <em>free </em>feels less like a gift and more like a tax you pay by waiting to actually use the product. The opportunity for frontier AI is to break that pattern by making promotional content feel like a feature that even paid‑tier accounts may want to keep, so paid plans can focus on adding capabilities rather than simply removing frustration taxes.</p><h4>Strengths of the AI pioneer</h4><p>Shifting over to ChatGPT and other frontier AI platforms, the obvious risk is that ads will simply adopt the same look &amp; feel they have on search engines — specifically those “sponsored” results at the top of the page — but these tools are capable of much more than that. While I don’t have the exact data in front of me, I often wonder how frequently people scroll past those sponsored results to reach the first organic link and how often accidental clicks leave them feeling misled instead of helped. One recent roundup of digital ad research found that around 86% of users report banner blindness (effectively ignoring banner‑like advertising) and that average banner engagement rates hover around 0.06%.⁵</p><p>If frontier AI platforms adopt a similar pattern, I imagine the analytics data won’t change much. However, these platforms aren’t doing the same things as search engines are either — they do a lot more, of course. They’re great at synthesizing content from a variety of sources based on the content of the user’s prompt. And they’re quickly doing more.</p><p>Advertisements can also be better with AI platforms. If search engines, YouTube, and other digital platforms can have targeted ads just based on what’s known about the user’s interests, they can do all the more with a conversational AI-chat thread. Even a basic prompt contains far more data than a general search query, and users are far more likely to write in natural language to AI platforms than to traditional search boxes. This can include nuanced details, context, and specificity that wasn’t as easy to do with a search engine — even with advanced search tools. Further, AI removes the need to scan through each individual webpage because of synthesized responses and linking to the sources, allowing us to verify content.</p><h4>Discovering marketed electricity</h4><p>A month or so ago, several outlets in our kitchen stopped working after a GFCI outlet tripped, and a quick do-it-yourself (DIY) attempt led to a small spark behind the outlet. At that point, the problem moved from <em>easy DIY project</em> to <em>I need a reputable professional who won’t overcharge me</em>. So imagine I turn to an AI assistant and type something like:</p><blockquote>I have three outlets that went out in our kitchen. I replaced a GFCI outlet, but when I pulled it back out to check the wiring I saw a small spark behind the outlet. I’m comfortable with basic DIY, but I don’t want to risk an electrical fire or make the problem worse. I’m looking for an electrician near me who is thorough, is transparent about pricing, and won’t pressure me into unnecessary work. Give me a few options and explain which one you’d choose for this situation.</blockquote><p>This is a solid example of the kind of urgent, high‑anxiety scenarios where ads could either quietly undermine trust or actually help. To illustrate this further, I’m treating my electrical experience as a small case study, exploring what happens if we replace the “sponsored” tag on a search result with richer promotional features like coupons, adjacent follow-up answers, and a contextual panel that doesn’t distract from the main thread so much.</p><p>So, how might ads be smartly introduced from a prompt like this? Well, maybe there are a few ways. First, imagine a fairly conventional AI response: a ranked list of three electricians with one of them tagged “Sponsored.”</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot mock of an AI chat response listing three electricians in a vertical comparison, with one option marked by a small ‘Sponsored’ tag, illustrating the default search-style ad pattern."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/792/1*XRKhqWoRxsWNgaDi0cu_HA.png"" /><figcaption>Conventional AI response: a comparison list of electricians with a tiny “Sponsored” tag.</figcaption></figure><p>This is the default pattern we’ve inherited from search. It technically discloses the ad, but it also quietly introduces doubt for the whole recommendation: am I getting the best fit for my needs or just the company with the highest advertising budget?</p><p>In my actual experience, my AI thread included a local map view with some content cards for each electrical company in my area. Let’s build on that, using content cards as our starting point, and ask a few ‘what ifs’:</p><ul><li>What if the promoted company showed an accurate cost of the exact service I need, based on what other customers actually paid?</li><li>What if there were coupons, discounts, or perks that directly benefit me for choosing that particular business?</li><li>What if some of the “sponsored” content complimented what I was asking about, like payment plans or DIY tutorials?</li></ul><p>Now compare that conventional AI response to one that uses thoughtfully integrated ads: the same electricians but with richer promotional features with a contextual panel that’s noninvasive to the main chat thread.</p><figure><img alt=""Mock AI response showing three electrician cards side by side, each with price, reviews, a short description, and buttons for actions like ‘Read reviews’ and ‘Compare GFCI troubleshooting costs,’ illustrating a richer sponsored card layout."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/792/1*Q9WcYea2yv8d2gceOu2M6w.png"" /><figcaption>Smartly integrated ad cards with costs, perks, and follow‑up CTAs.</figcaption></figure><p>Under the hood, this card layout is doing a few specific things. First, I kept the familiar basics — company name, review rating, a link to the website, a call-to-action (CTA) to get in touch, and a short description. Second, the information is grouped by kind: company name, description &amp; website link; cost, reviews, and a link to the full verbatims; and, promotional perk with a CTA for the next step in the user journey.</p><figure><img alt=""Close-up of a single electrician card showing company name, star rating, description, price, cost explanation, and action buttons stacked together, demonstrating information grouping within the card."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4f2VaxhBFG_jZ60QMbJ-cA.png"" /><figcaption>Electrician card layout with grouped details for one company.</figcaption></figure><p>Where it begins to differ is in the cost row: instead of a vague price range, the card shows the specific amount customers reported paying for the service I’m asking about, plus a link to the reviews that mention the prices. That turns the “ad” element into a reasonable expectation, not just a badge.</p><figure><img alt=""Zoomed-in view of the price section on an electrician card, with a bold dollar amount and a line explaining that the cost is based on similar customer reviews, plus a link to detailed reviews."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_Mi_H53mh0PEXi-WeGfj2g.png"" /><figcaption>Cost row highlighting typical customer‑reported price and linked reviews.</figcaption></figure><p>There’s also an emphasized coupon or perk label, providing another incentive that directly benefits the user, much like scouting through <em>RetailMeNot</em> or <em>Groupon</em> for a promo code. The difference is the value is surfaced in context, before you ever hit a checkout page.</p><figure><img alt=""Zoomed-in view of an electrician card showing a ‘Free inspection coupon’ badge next to the action buttons, representing a user-benefiting promotional perk embedded in the card."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*z1ZPnOWDHTT6AuaSTSmwQg.png"" /><figcaption>Sponsored perk: a clearly labeled coupon for a free inspection.</figcaption></figure><p>Last, sponsored content can come from an information scent by labeling actions in the user’s own language (“Reliable DIY tutorials,” “Electricians with payment plans,” etc.), making them feel like relevant next steps rather than distractions. Together, these tweaks improve the overall signal‑to‑noise ratio by making sure every promotional element either clarifies incentives or opens a relevant, optional path you might actually want to take.</p><figure><img alt=""Mock of three pill-shaped buttons beneath the main electrician recommendation labeled ‘Compare GFCI troubleshooting costs,’ ‘Electricians with payment plans,’ and ‘Reliable DIY tutorials,’ showing opt‑in sub‑search routes."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-joPf8gZZKPSZrqVr_lEZA.png"" /><figcaption>Optional CTAs launching focused sub‑threads for costs, payment plans, and DIY.</figcaption></figure><p>Each predetermined CTA launches a focused sub‑thread where the AI can surface related, sponsored resources without hijacking the main topic.

It’s still promotional, but will compliment the user’s thread instead of interrupting the train of thought with noise or other frustration taxes.</p><figure><img alt=""Full-page mockup of an AI chat interface with the conversation on the left and a right-aligned ‘Thread insights’ panel on the right containing electrician cards, costs, and action buttons, demonstrating a dedicated ad space that updates with the thread."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*szASXnWFl8Jdcd3XRWak1w.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Contextual right‑hand panel showing electrician cards and insights alongside the main thread.</figcaption></figure><p>Cards with all the ad-types are most likely the ‘maximal’ version for a high‑stakes case, but even one or two of these ideas would give users a real sense of reciprocity &amp; incentive to interact with the advertised perks. Companies willing to pay for ad space could compromise by allowing more transparency by showing the specific average amount customers paid, reciprocity by offering concrete perks &amp; coupons, or autonomy by sponsoring alternative solutions like DIY content for their questions.</p><p>Compared to the tiny “sponsored” tag next to <em>BrightSpark Electrical</em> in the conventional AI response, these cards make the advertising work more for the users. The promoted content is still promotional, but it’s packaged utility in the form of transparent costs, valuable perks, and alternative solutions. Consequently, it’s more likely users will actually engage with it, instead of tuning out the noise or being suspicious of it.</p><h4>Mapping out the new frontier</h4><p>Free‑tier AI platforms with ads don’t have to inherit the same frustration tax we’ve learned from YouTube commercials and sponsored search results. The electrician example is small, but it shows how promotional content can be reshaped into something that actually helps in a stressful, high‑stakes situation.</p><p>Structurally, the move is simple: treat ads as enhancing features, not just paid recommendations. Thoughtfully-integrated ads in content cards, sub-threads offering alternative solutions, and dedicated layouts that compliment the main thread give advertised content visibility while simultaneously benefitting the user. At their best, these patterns also line up with the UX virtues I’ve hinted at earlier &amp; argued for elsewhere: <em>transparent </em>content from promoted businesses, <em>reciprocity</em> in the form of perks &amp; discounts, and preserving user <em>autonomy </em>by allowing the user to choose alternative paths — while also removing frustration taxes.⁶</p><p>As more frontier AI platforms roll out free‑tier plans with ads, the real question isn’t whether to show ads at all, but which patterns we normalize. Do we copy the suspicious “sponsored” tag &amp; hope users still engage with it, or invest in thoughtful experiences that users would miss if premium plans removed them? Now is the moment to decide which pattern AI platforms ship.</p><blockquote><strong>AI usage disclaimer</strong>: <em>AI tools were used for editing visual assets, writing feedback, assistance in locating relevant sources, &amp; Chicago-style citation formatting; all early drafts, ideas, arguments, &amp; experiences in this article are my own.</em></blockquote><h3>References</h3><p>[1] Simo, Fidji. “Our Approach to Advertising and Expanding Access to ChatGPT.” <em>OpenAI</em>.

<h4>The path to designing for AI is in questioning the fundamentals of what design stands for</h4><figure><img alt=""A designer shedding the past design artifacts and embracing the future of emerging tech"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1020/1*LE0BFPSuq6HxhmN7zt2pAQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image Credit: AI Generated Image</figcaption></figure><p>I admire artists and industrial designers who challenge assumptions. Ross Lovegrove is one of them. If you’ve never heard of him, he is one of the most visionary creators in the world, and designs all sorts of devices, including door handles, computers, fragrance bottles, and concept cars.</p><p><a href=""https://www.wallpaper.com/design-interiors/ross-lovegrove-on-working-with-ai""><strong>In an article in the popular design magazine Wallpaper</strong></a>, he claims that the potential of working with AI is utopian. That says a lot coming from someone considered by many as a futurist.</p><p>Lovegrove admits that most people in his generation, including design leaders, are skeptical of AI’s use in design. He doesn’t belong to that group, as he says that “AI is complementary, like having a conversation with a very intelligent friend.” He even built a Carrara marble sculpture in collaboration with a robot!</p><p>After reading Lovegrove’s take on AI, I asked myself: Are design leaders prepared for this new AI era? Or, more precisely, what do they need to unlearn to stay relevant and lead their teams in a world where AI is reshaping how we create?</p><p>Here’s what I’m unlearning, and what I think other design leaders should consider letting go of too.</p><h4>#1. “AI enablement is (just) a tooling decision”</h4><figure><img alt=""Chart showing AI code-generation success rates for novices and experts. Novices show 79% success, while experts show 90% success. Purple represents success and orange represents failure, displayed over a background of a person viewing multiple computer screens."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_B-jLlsLe5dcH5q-4u4JYg.png"" /></figure><p>This might be a hard pill to swallow for some design leaders and any business leaders in general.</p><p>Before we entered what we now call an AI-first world, AI felt like a frontier that was approaching slowly. Leaders could afford to experiment, pilot a few tools, let teams test them out, see what stuck… It was like a free buffet where everyone could try the new shiny thing without much risk.</p><p>The problem now is how your team uses it, because the consequences of this free-for-all approach can be the opposite of what you expect: AI tools expose the talent gap in your team.</p><p>A 2025 study titled<strong><em> </em></strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2509.21890v1""><strong>Not Everyone Wins with LLMs: Behavioral Patterns and Pedagogical Implications in AI-assisted Data Analysis</strong></a>, sheds some light on this. In it, researchers tracked 36 students as they used an LLM to complete programming and data analysis tasks. Everyone had equal access to the same AI tools.</p><p>The study found that students with strong data &amp; coding foundations used AI to extend their thinking, explore alternatives, and debug more quickly. Those with weaker fundamentals often copy pasted outputs, misread results, or got overwhelmed by verbose explanations.</p><p>Now extrapolate this to your design team. If you just democratize the use of AI without paying attention to core fundamentals like systems thinking, experimentation, and evaluating AI output, your best performers will become even better at their craft, but junior designers may fall behind and become too dependent on AI.</p><p>Choosing the right tools is still and will remain relevant for years to come, but it’s equally important to build capability from the ground up so your team can use AI to extend their thinking. Today, AI enablement is a talent strategy decision.</p><h4>#2. “Designers (only) design interfaces, researchers (only) provide insights”</h4><p>There was a time when a designer had a very specific role, and so did researchers. And it was easy to assign them tasks, goals, and projects because everything worked like a well-oiled machine.</p><p>AI has changed the way we box these positions in. Can we already say we are on the verge of seeing more hybrid roles in design teams? J.M. Downey, Director of Design Strategy &amp; Research at AT&amp;T, thinks so.</p><p>Downey is one of the design leadership voices interviewed in the 2025 report<strong> </strong><a href=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65b848447e935c9f1f8e6ec5/68357bcd7d7740446815dbba_The%20AI%20Shift.pdf""><strong>The AI Shift: Transforming How We Discover, Imagine, and Design</strong></a>, conducted by the Design Executive Council (DXC). He sees his team as design strategists as much as he sees them as researchers. “That’s the future of this discipline,” he claims.</p><p>Most leaders interviewed for DXC’s report agreed that the old boundaries between design and research no longer work. For example, Dave Brown, who leads design for AI services at Amazon Web Services, says, “Design and research now need to look across the whole stack.” He’s talking about understanding how data flows, how models make decisions, and how those decisions show up in the user experience.</p><p>My perspective aligns with what they all say. Design leaders must adapt to what’s coming and upskill their teams for new challenges. Your designer needs to understand what the AI is optimizing for, why it’s making certain recommendations, and how to design friction when users need transparency or control. Your researcher can’t just deliver insights and walk away. They need to shape how those insights get embedded into product decisions, AI training, and business strategy.</p><p>An AI-first world demands strategic builders. Your team needs them, starting with yourself.</p><h4>#3. “Polish, craft, and aesthetics are what make design good”</h4><figure><img alt=""Statistics showing 52% of respondents believe design is more important in AI-powered products than in traditional digital products, displayed over a background of a person sketching an interface on a tablet."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*cENQNgrjZtPySAfi9nmTKQ.png"" /></figure><p>When you read this headline, it might sound like an oversimplification. I’m not arguing that design leaders have ever cared only about how a product looks, but I do include myself among those who have, at times, over-indexed on polished prototypes, pixel-perfect interfaces, and visual refinement as proxies for quality.</p><p>In AI-powered products, that definition of quality isn’t enough. Designing with AI introduces additional layers of responsibility and complexity. Beyond aesthetics and usability, which remain essential, quality now also includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Trust:</strong> Can users rely on the system’s outputs over time?</li><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Do users understand why the system made a recommendation or took an action?</li><li><strong>Graceful degradation:</strong> Does the product communicate uncertainty and fail safely when it doesn’t know something, rather than confidently producing wrong results?</li></ul><p>In this context, a visually polished interface can mask deeper issues: unreliable outputs, opaque decision-making, brittle behavior at the edges… Design leaders must therefore stop measuring quality just by surface-level polish and instead treat trust, clarity, and reliability as first-class design outcomes.</p><p>According to <a href=""https://cdn.sanity.io/files/599r6htc/regionalized/d4e0b1140b4d4d32c004e442bdb3e9f136fd3657.pdf""><strong>Figma’s 2025 AI Report</strong></a>, more than half of designers and AI builders believe design has become more important for AI-powered products, precisely because users now depend on design to interpret, evaluate, and trust intelligent systems.</p><p>For the design leaders of the future, great design will be defined by how confidently users can understand a system and rely on it in real-world conditions.</p><h4>#4. “Speed equals progress”</h4><figure><img alt=""Statistic showing 89% of designers say AI has improved their workflow, displayed over a background of a computer screen with AI interface windows and connected data elements."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HXZAT1UYCqpYw8qJ-Tq4Rg.png"" /></figure><p>I’ve heard many times in my career things like “moving faster is always the right move” or “if we ship faster, we win.” Well, these assumptions may be wrong today. Although I agree that for certain companies, especially startups, speed is a virtue, for the most part, we should stay vigilant when hearing such claims.</p><p>There’s one thing we all love about AI: it makes us faster. It can accelerate good work, there’s no doubt about it, but it can also accelerate mistakes. I recently read an article in <a href=""https://www.cio.com/article/4076280/why-ai-initiatives-fail-the-costly-mistakes-it-leaders-make-and-how-you-can-avoid-them.html""><strong>CIO magazine</strong></a> on why AI initiatives fail, and one of the reasons mentioned was, indeed, ‘rushed pilots.’</p><p>Often, when pressured by stakeholders, business leaders may feel the need to deploy products without clear goals or proper processes, just to release them as quickly as possible. And design teams fall into the trap, mistaking speed and novelty for progress.</p><p>As per the <a href=""https://www.stateofaidesign.com/""><strong>State of AI in Design Report 2025</strong></a>, 89% of designers say AI has improved their workflow in some way. Your team may already be benefiting from this. They are more productive, and you get tangible results. Everything works faster, and everyone’s celebrating that. But is the work truly <em>better</em>?</p><p>The best design leaders know when to slow down, validate, and ensure that what they’re building is worth shipping.</p><h4>Closing thoughts</h4><p>One day, not too far away, we won’t talk about an “AI-first world”, just <em>our </em>world, much like we no longer say we’re in an “Internet-driven world”. AI will be embedded in everything, just as the internet is now.</p><p>Until then, design leaders have time to build and, apologies for the redundancy, ‘design’ this new reality. That means unlearning some of the universal truths we all took as sacred, as set in stone.</p><p><strong><em>Want to see how we’re putting these principles into practice?

<h4>AI assistants don’t have to communicate in paragraphs. They can communicate through interfaces.</h4><figure><img alt=""A paper cutout illustration showing an AI assistant chat interface on the left connected to a design system library on the right."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ec6csH34-8uaTEWIkXZ6Gg.png"" /><figcaption>Generated using Google Gemini</figcaption></figure><p>LLMs have made AI assistants a standard feature across SaaS. AI assistants allow users to instantly retrieve information and interact with a system through text-based prompts. Mathias Biilmann, in his article “<a href=""https://biilmann.blog/articles/introducing-ax/"">Introducing AX: Why Agent Experience Matters</a>,” discusses two distinct approaches to building AI assistants. The Closed Approach involves a conversational assistant embedded directly within a single SaaS product. Examples include Zoom’s AI Companion, Salesforce CRM’s Einstein, and Microsoft’s Copilot. The Open Approach involves external conversational assistants, such as Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini, which are being supercharged via protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol). This protocol allows the AI assistants to connect to and interact with various third-party SaaS products, effectively making a company’s product accessible to external assistants and agents.</p><h3>The risk of commoditization</h3><p>Both approaches are powerful. They offer users flexibility they’ve never had. However, they also reduce the carefully crafted user experience to a purely text-based interface. When the interaction is text-only and detached from your product, the user experience is no longer a differentiator, and your <a href=""https://www.pragmaticcoders.com/blog/saas-is-dead-how-ai-agents-reduced-saas-to-just-an-api"">product is at risk of becoming a commodity</a>.</p><p>Text-only interfaces also limit interactions to simple information retrieval and basic CRUD operations, making complex workflows difficult. This <a href=""https://artium.ai/insights/beyond-chat-how-ai-is-transforming-ui-design-patterns"">creates limitations</a> as users attempt to consume large amounts of information and execute complex operations solely through text prompts. Andrej Karpathy, in his recent piece<a href=""https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/year-in-review-2025/""> 2025 LLM Year in Review</a>, noted that while text is the favored format for computers and LLMs, it is not for humans. We humans prefer information visually. Similarly, Maximillian Piras in 2024, argued that <a href=""https://uxmag.com/articles/when-words-cannot-describe-designing-for-ai-beyond-conversational-interfaces"">chat is often a poor fit for complex interaction patterns</a>.</p><h3>The temptation of generative UI</h3><p>One answer gaining traction is generative UI where the AI autonomously creates interfaces based on the user’s prompts. While this capability is likely to improve significantly, it also presents a risk of delivering generic experiences. Without designer input, AI-generated UX defaults to the generic average of its training data. Every product starts looking the same. There is no differentiation. Dorian Tireli describes how <a href=""https://poplab.io/commoditization-saas-design-ai/"">AI is reinforcing mediocrity</a> due to training data coming from common design platforms that are optimized for visual appeal.</p><h3>The case for design system integration</h3><p>As a result, we need to examine an alternate approach, one where the AI assistants have knowledge of a product’s unique design system — its components, patterns, and guidelines. Any time the user prompts, instead of displaying text blocks and paragraphs, what if the assistant could render rich interfaces supplied by the product’s design system? This transforms the chat from a static text box into a dynamic viewport with rich interactive elements. The <a href=""https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-01-26-mcp-apps/"">latest developments</a> in the MCP protocol are making this approach possible.</p><figure><img alt=""Flow diagram showing a user prompting the AI assistant which then communicates with the Design System that returns a UI component. The UI component is then rendered to the user as a response."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/714/1*jRw1B92fdpVGV7Tw_D_DLA.png"" /><figcaption>Designed using Figma</figcaption></figure><h3>Three modes for richer AI experiences</h3><p>To create richer and differentiated experiences, I have considered three different design modes that can help us move beyond the text-trap.</p><h4>Mode 1: Rich output</h4><p>In complex business applications, users consume data, not just answers. Large blocks of text create cognitive load. The challenge is to move beyond text and towards a richer UI output. For example, when a user prompts “Merge the two John Smith records flagged yesterday,” the AI doesn’t ask “Which one should be primary?” Instead, it displays two contact cards side-by-side with metadata, enabling the user to make a decision through the UI. This approach maximizes scannability and allows the user to instantly grasp the situation and prioritize follow-up.</p><figure><img alt=""AI assistant displaying two contact cards for the user to choose between using visual cues."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/872/1*M0bgD1X-TCn5hFBfSC4coQ.png"" /><figcaption>Designed using Figma Make</figcaption></figure><h4>Mode 2: UI as input</h4><p>The differentiated experience must start at the point of input, not just output. Rather than forcing users to craft precise text prompts and requiring them to know the exact parameters to provide, imagine if the AI assistant could replace the text box with a structured input component. For example, when a user wants to retrieve a record, instead of typing “Show me California leads with high activity” and then requiring the user to re-prompt every time they want to add more parameters, the AI assistant simply displays a query builder.</p><figure><img alt=""AI assistant displaying a filter UI, making it easier for the user to choose parameters as opposed to having to type a detailed query."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/872/1*qXe8NrqwVlPjifV34woP3g.png"" /><figcaption>Designed using Figma Make</figcaption></figure><p>This shift from text to high-fidelity input removes ambiguity, reduces back-and-forth, and makes the overall interaction faster and more precise.</p><h4>Mode 3: Co-creation</h4><p>Modes 1 and 2 represent single interactions. But real-world scenarios are rarely this simple. In SaaS applications, high-value tasks are multi-step workflows. Creating a marketing automation campaign. Building a complex report. Configuring an integration. These aren’t things you accomplish in one prompt, rather they unfold over a conversation where the user and AI assistant refine the work together.</p><p>To support this, the AI assistant needs to become more than a responder. <strong>It needs to become a workspace.</strong></p><p>Let’s see how this plays out through a single scenario: a user creating a marketing automation campaign. The user prompts: “Create a campaign for trial users who haven’t activated yet.” The AI responds by rendering a flow builder component showing a draft campaign.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows a flow generated by the AI assistant based on the user’s prompt. The user asked the AI assistant to create campaign for trial users who haven’t activated yet."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pJjd37QJ5eFZNFj_L8ektA.png"" /><figcaption>Made using Figma</figcaption></figure><p>From here, <strong>four capabilities</strong> transform a back-and-forth conversation into a co-creation model.</p><p><strong>Fluid modality switching<br /></strong>When the user wants to update a block, they shouldn’t be forced back to the text prompt. The AI assistant should allow users to move fluidly between text and direct manipulation. For example, rather than prompting “change the wait time to 5 days,” the user simply adjusts the wait component directly in the flow builder. The AI validates the change and updates dependent elements automatically.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows the flow components rendered by the AI assistant. The user directly interacts with the UI elements and updates the flow as opposed to asking the AI assistant to make changes."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3W3npKqeOz42lXXqZf1JNw.png"" /><figcaption>(Made using Figma)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Proactive cross-tool suggestions<br /></strong>Complex workflows often span multiple tools and users need information from various sources to take better decisions. Rather than forcing the user to start a new conversation or open a new tab, the AI assistant can bring data from connected tools directly into the workflow. Better yet, it can surface insights proactively.</p><p>In our example, once the flow has been created, the AI notices that most unactivated users are on mobile, while the email templates are desktop-focused. Without being prompted, it pulls usage data from the connected analytics tool and surfaces a brief insight within the flow builder: “68% of your unactivated trial users are on mobile, but your email templates aren’t mobile-optimized.”</p><figure><img alt=""The GIF shows the AI assistant proactively displaying insights from relevant tools and sources. As the user is updating the flow, the AI assistant pulls data from an analytics tool and informs that user that most of the unactivated users are on mobile whereas all the email templates in the flow are web based."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8GVVr2klWv6iLVqViVYPWg.gif"" /><figcaption>(Created using Figma and Figma Make)</figcaption></figure><p>For this to work, the AI assistant needs the right level of access to the data. But access alone isn’t enough. The judgment layer needs to be designed to know when an insight is worth surfacing and when silence is the better choice.</p><p><strong>Delegation of discrete subtasks<br /></strong>At some point in a multi-step workflow, the user may want to hand off a contained piece of work entirely. Based on the mobile optimization insight, the user prompts the AI assistant to update the template. The AI assistant then takes on the content work while the user continues refining the campaign’s structural logic. When ready, the AI surfaces the updated template for review. This is <strong>co-creation as division of labor</strong>, not just turn-taking.</p><figure><img alt=""Once the user accepts the AI assistant’s recommendation, the assistant goes to work on this sub-task while the user can continue to do their work. The assistant keeps the user informed on the progress and the user can take an informed decision."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ggzbqGj4XsiUp5r3gbaJgQ.gif"" /><figcaption>(Made using Figma and Figma Make)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Contextually refine with text<br /></strong> The text-based input doesn’t have to live in the prompt box — it can be contextual to the UI elements. For example, the user hovers over a connector in the flow and prompts, “Send a survey asking about their biggest challenge, then route them to different content tracks based on their answer.” In response, the AI inserts a new survey block before the final reminder email block, creates conditional branches based on common responses, and shows the multi-path workflow.</p><p>Because the prompt was anchored to a specific component rather than being in the generic prompt box, the AI understands where in the workflow the user is acting, not just what they’re saying. The library, Shape of AI by Emily Campbell highlights <a href=""https://www.shapeof.ai/patterns/inline-action"">Inline action</a> as way for user to adjust or respond to a small part of a larger piece of content.</p><figure><img alt=""This image shows the user prompting the AI assistant in context of the UI. The user clicks one of the nodes in the flow and asks the AI assistant to update the flow."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_q961WZJ3qbWUVUl5VF_Sg.gif"" /><figcaption>(Made using Figma and Figma Make)</figcaption></figure><p>In Mode 3, rather than forcing users into turn-by-turn conversations, the AI assistant becomes an added modality for the product’s experience. It holds context across tools so the user doesn’t have to. It creates <strong>a shared workspace for co-creation</strong> so the user and AI assistant can work together.</p><h3>The craft hasn’t changed</h3><p>While designing for AI assistants and AI agents may sound daunting at first, the good news is that the <a href=""https://www.salesforce.com/blog/ai-design-skills/"">skills required to succeed aren’t novel</a>. They’re the same fundamentals that have always distinguished exceptional designers.</p><p>You need a deep understanding of users and jobs-to-be-done to identify which tasks actually benefit from conversational AI. Systems thinking is quickly becoming one of the most important skills as highlighted in these articles from <a href=""https://www.salesforce.com/blog/ai-jobs-to-be-done-designers/#h-five-ways-design-work-is-shifting-and-how-to-respond"">Salesforce</a> and <a href=""https://adobe.design/stories/leading-design/six-human-skills-that-will-future-proof-your-design-career"">Adobe</a>. You need systems thinking, because these assistants cross boundaries, within your product’s IA and beyond it into other tools. And you need technical literacy: data models, APIs, backend logic. When users can query any data the system touches, you’d better understand what that data looks like.</p><p>AI assistants and agents are only going to keep increasing. The question isn’t whether your product will have one, it’s whether the experience will be differentiated or commoditized.</p><p>The text-trap is real, but it’s not inevitable.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=7035bbc4aaa5"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/ais-text-trap-moving-towards-a-more-interactive-future-7035bbc4aaa5"">AI’s text-trap: Moving towards a more interactive future</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Senior director <br /><strong>Industry:</strong> Non-profit<br /><strong>Age:</strong> 37<br /><strong>Location:</strong> Vancouver, BC<br /><strong>Salary:</strong> $170,000<br /><strong>Joint Income/Financial Setup:</strong> Our joint income is approx. $250,000. My salary is steady and predictable, but my husband works in film/TV, which is very unpredictable. Work was very slow during the pandemic and SAG-AFTRA/WGA strikes in the US, but he’s worked a lot more over the past year and will bring in about $80,000 this year. This also includes some very part-time graphic design work that he does on the side, and employment insurance when he’s not working. We also receive $542.50 from the government each year of Canada Child Benefit ($45.20 a month). My husband and I combine our finances. We have a joint credit card, bank accounts, and savings, which I manage, plus individual credit cards (for gifts etc.) and separate investments.<br /><strong>Assets:</strong> <br />Registered Retirement Savings Plan [RRSP]: $127,000 <br />Tax-Free Savings Account [TFSA]: $39,200 <br />Locked-In Retirement Account [LIRA]: $29,300<br />First Home Savings Account [FHSA]: $3,000<br />Husband’s RRSP: $74,491<br />Husband’s TFSA: $32,950<br />Joint Emergency Savings: $10,000<br />Joint Savings: $50,300<br /><strong>Debt:</strong> $0<br /><strong>Paycheck Amount (2x/month):</strong> $4,395<br /><strong>Pronouns:</strong> She/her<br /><br /><strong>Monthly Expenses</strong><br /><br /><strong>Housing Costs:</strong> $3,998 for a two-bed, one-bath apartment, parking space, and storage locker. <br /><strong>Loan Payments:</strong> n/a<br /><strong>Electricity:</strong> $100<br /><strong>Internet:</strong> $78<br /><strong>Daycare:</strong> $1060 (the full price would be $1605, but the government provides a $545 subsidy).<br /><strong>Gym:</strong> $90<br /><strong>House Cleaner:</strong> $90<br /><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> $31.64<br /><strong>Phone:</strong> $218 ($68 for me, $150 for my husband)<br /><strong>Tenants Insurance:</strong> $26.39<br /><strong>Car Insurance:</strong> $157.92<br /><strong>Pet Insurance:</strong> $302<br /><strong>NYT:</strong> $2.10<br /><strong>Spotify Premium:</strong> $20.04<br /><strong>iCloud storage:</strong> $12.99<br /><strong>Crave:</strong> $24.64<br /><strong>Disney+:</strong> $15.99<br /><strong>Netflix:</strong> Included in internet<br /><strong>Apple TV:</strong> $12.99<br /><strong>Shudder:</strong> $8.99<br /><strong>Patreon:</strong> $14.97 (<em>The Birth Hour</em> podcast and Aja Barber)<br /><strong>BCAA:</strong> $20.56<br /><strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong> (for my husband’s work): $29.11<br /><strong>Dropbox</strong> (for my husband’s work): $31.35<br /><strong>Bank account fees:</strong> $16.95<br /><strong>Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP):</strong> $200<br /><strong>RRSP Contribution</strong> (comes from my paycheck and is matched by my employer): $708<br /><strong>Extended healthcare:</strong> $0 (paid for by my work)<br /><strong>Charitable Donations:</strong> $106 (Black Lives Matter, Binners Project, Canadian Mental Health Association, Indian Residential School Survivors Society)<br /><br /><strong>Annual expenses</strong> <br /><strong>Credit card fees:</strong> $135<br /><strong>Amazon Prime:</strong> $110.88<br /><br /><strong>Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?</strong><br />Yes. I grew up in the UK, and neither of my parents went to university (although my dad later completed a degree part-time at night school), but I was expected to go to a good one. I didn’t get an offer from any of my top three schools because my predicted grades weren’t as high as I needed (even though my actual grades were top marks — the UK system is weird), but I still landed at a top-20 university. I paid for my tuition and living expenses with student loans and part-time jobs, but my parents paid for my rent until I graduated, aged 20 (it was a three-year program).<br /><br /><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?</strong><br />I was brought up not to ask about or share specifics on salaries or spending, as it was deemed rude (very British). I knew neither of my parents grew up with much money, but my dad eventually worked in software engineering, and we were comfortably middle-class. My dad started a few companies, and my mom was always terrified about the lack of financial stability. They’re both quite cautious, and I remember being told that saving for retirement was key and not to place my pension in any remotely risky investments. They’re now retired and living in Canada close to me, and are very worried that I don’t own a home, and likely won’t any time soon.<br /><br /><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?</strong><br />I got a job working in the village shop on Saturday mornings aged 13. My parents encouraged me to learn the value of work and commitment, and I loved the extra spending money ($18 USD a week). I quit when I got a better paying job at age 16, and my younger brother took over at the shop.<br /><br /><strong>Did you worry about money growing up?</strong><br />Not in the day-to-day sense. Occasionally, I’d pick up some tension or uncertainty from my parents, and there were tighter times than others, but I had everything I needed for school, and we went on vacation every couple of years.<br /><br /><strong>Do you worry about money now?</strong><br />Yes. I have a great salary and solid savings, but rent and daycare come to 60% of my income, and my husband’s work is very unstable. Any money we do save when he’s working subsidizes our living expenses when he’s not. Saying that, we could definitely cut down on our expenses (coffees, meals out) if we really had to. Buying a place to live in Vancouver feels out of the question, so I worry about our long-term plans, especially as we need more space for my son as he gets older. I’m on the wait list for a co-op and really hope we get in within the next couple of years.<br /><br /><strong>At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?</strong><br />Aged 20 when I graduated from university, and my parents stopped paying my rent. They’re now retired and are on a budget, but they would definitely give me a loan if I needed it (as long as I paid them back).<br /><br /><strong>Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.</strong><br />My parents gave me $15,000 towards my wedding in 2017, and $25,000 in 2022 as part of my grandmother’s inheritance when she passed away. We used some of it to buy a car when our old one died, and most of it went to keeping us debt-free when I was on maternity leave and my husband had a 10-month stretch of not working.</p>



<h3>Day One: Wednesday</h3>



<p>7:20 a.m. — I wake up to my alarm and lie in bed thinking about morning logistics. My son D., is now a three-nager, and recently started a new daycare which has longer opening hours and is close-ish to my office. My husband K., is working on a movie at the moment, so I’m usually on daycare duty on the bus, but he has a rare late start today, so I can take the car. I drag myself out of bed, do my morning routine of Origins Ginzing Moisturizer, and get D. out of the door — though not without some protests.</p>



<p>9 a.m. — I start my workday from home, with an instant coffee to help me navigate my inbox. I’ve moved house since my last Money Diary, into a two-bed apartment in a new rental building about a five-minute walk from the Co-Op I was subletting. This place is a third of the size of the last place and triple the rent which is painful, but the views are amazing, and the location is perfect. Luckily, K. has been working a lot this year, and I also started my current job three months ago. It was a really hard decision to leave my last role, which I loved, but it’s a step up to VP level with a small salary bump (though the healthcare benefits and PTO aren’t as good), and I knew I’d get out of my comfort zone and learn so much. I’m now responsible for operations and HR, so I have a couple of calls about a salesforce transformation project I’m leading, and work on some job descriptions. K. takes the dog for a walk, stopping off for a coffee and a pastry. <strong>$11.24</strong></p>



<p>9:01 a.m. — …and a bag of prescription food from the vet. It’s a new diet and our pet insurance will reimburse about $35 per bag for the first two months — but soon we’ll be covering the full amount. When K. gets back, he heads to work. I heat up and eat a frozen mini burrito for a late breakfast, then have a baked potato with tuna mayonnaise for lunch. <strong>$87.62</strong></p>



<p>2 p.m. — I walk the dog around the block, then change into “business casual” (jeans and a nice top) and head into the office. I have a weekly 1:1 with my boss on Wednesday afternoon, and I always prefer to have it in person. Our talk today is particularly important, as it’s been a frustrating couple of days and I have some feedback to share about how we’re working together (or not). I make an iced coffee for the road, and take the bus as it’s too hot outside to walk without turning into a sweaty mess. <strong>$2.70</strong></p>



<p>5:15 p.m. — The conversation goes well! I suggested we get out of the office for a walking meeting, which was definitely the right call, but I’ve racked up 7,000 steps in flats that squeeze my toes, and am a sweaty mess after all. No Evo’s (local car share company) today, so I take an Uber to daycare and arrive right before they close at 5:30 p.m. It takes a while to get him all packed up, and we miss the bus by a minute! I melt at the bus stop for 15 minutes while we wait for the next one, which we jump off early to pick up a photo book of D.’s photos from his mini kid camera (paid for when I ordered it last week). He loves it, and we look through it together on the final bus home. <strong>$14.10</strong></p>



<p>6:15 p.m. — Back home and I am exhausted. D. and I look through the photo book together, then FaceTime my parents who are living their best retirement life and sailing around the Gulf Islands this week. I make D. a peanut butter sandwich and some strawberries, while I finish off a leftover portion of tortellini with cheese sauce. D. is mad at me because there isn’t more pasta, and goes to play alone in his room (that’s the three-nager part). I use the time to tidy the kitchen.</p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — K. gets home. We try to tidy D.’s room since the cleaner comes tomorrow and we can barely see the floor for Hot Wheels, but D. throws his pajamas out of our 14th floor window and things devolve. Luckily for me, K. is on bedtime tonight, so I take a much-needed shower, clean the kitchen, and pack tomorrow’s lunches for D. and myself (K. is very well-fed on set). When I’m done, I book tickets to the outdoor pool for Saturday as it looks like good weather. It’s Labor Day weekend and we were going to go to Whistler, but my parents aren’t around to dog sit and I decided taking a three-year-old and a dog wouldn’t be so relaxing, so I cancelled our hotel last night. <strong>$17.92</strong></p>



<p>10:20 p.m. — K. emerges from D.’s room. We quickly talk through the next day’s schedule, then I do my nighttime routine (Sunday Riley Good Genes serum and Olay moisturizer) and get into bed. I am absolutely hooked on <em>The Americans</em> right now, so I watch part of an episode, then switch to a podcast and fall asleep around 11:30 p.m.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $133.58</strong></p>



<h3>Day Two: Thursday</h3>



<p>7:15 a.m. — Alarm goes off, and I wake up from a very deep sleep with D. next to me. He wakes up in the middle of the night and comes into bed with us most nights, which I don’t mind as long as he stays still. I get up, get dressed, give the dog his morning pill (he just turned 12 and he’s on five pills a day for various ailments), and get D. an Eggo waffle and a banana for breakfast. D. is upset I gave the dog his pill first and throws his food on the floor.</p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — K. is taking D. to preschool today, which is great as Thursday is one of my two office days. I enjoy the office and go every day when K. isn’t working, but need to be home for the dog more when he is. I planned to be on the bus by 8:20, but the food-throwing and some potty assistance delay me. I end up taking an Uber to the office. <strong>$9.52</strong></p>



<p>10 a.m. — K. does the daycare drop-off then picks up a dark roast with mocha syrup from Starbucks across the street. I do an in-person interview at the office, which I really enjoy, but the candidate isn’t a fit. <strong>$1.97</strong></p>



<p>12 p.m. — The dog walker and cleaner (in monthly expenses) both arrive at lunchtime, and I buzz them in from my cellphone. <strong>$20</strong></p>



<p>2:45 p.m. — The afternoon flies by in a blur of meetings, including some interview debriefs and a “Party Planning Committee” meeting to plan our Summer BBQ next week. I take a short walk to get some fresh air, and find myself at a coffee shop buying a vanilla latte and a chocolate walnut cookie. The cookie is delicious, but I regret spending the money almost immediately. <strong>$13.47</strong></p>



<p>5:15 p.m. — Leave work later than planned as I had to wait for our weekly payables to be ready for approval, so I grab an Uber to daycare. <strong>$10.15</strong></p>



<p>5:30 — I pick up D. and take him to the grocery store to pick up watermelon and pineapple for a daycare potluck picnic tomorrow, plus some fruit freezies that D. spies. The bus is still 15 minutes away and D. is hungry, so I get him a banana bread at the coffee shop next door before it arrives for the bus). <strong>$32.92</strong></p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — I throw some laundry on as soon as I walk in the door, and see that B. has found my mini Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk lipstick (a gift from a friend) and drawn all over his face. Dinner is a mix of baked potato, baked beans, cheese, broccoli, and some pineapple and watermelon that I’ve chopped for the potluck. K. gets home around 8:45 p.m., and I start D.’s bedtime. The routine involves some playing, some books, and lying uncomfortably on the floor next to his crib while he falls asleep. We’re hoping his new daycare will cut his naps as he’s getting older, so he’ll go to sleep earlier.</p>



<p>10:15 p.m. — D. is finally asleep, so I shower and head straight to bed.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $88.03</strong></p>



<h3>Day Three: Friday</h3>



<p>7:15 a.m. — I had set my alarm to help K. with the morning routine, but he tells me his call time was pushed back overnight, so I don’t need to be up just yet. I’m exhausted but can’t fall back asleep, so I shower, take the dog on a longer walk than usual, and catch up on my voice notes. I stop at my favourite coffee shop for a large caramel latte. K. also picks up a coffee and a pastry after daycare drop-off. <strong>$18.80</strong></p>



<p>9 a.m. — My calendar is usually empty on a Friday, so I hold the time to catch up on work. However, today everyone wants a “quick chat” and I’m on back-to-back calls all morning. One of them is to finalize a colleague’s promotion, which we celebrate by text. I make a quick sandwich for lunch, pack for the daycare potluck, and take an Uber to the office with my homemade iced coffee in hand. <strong>$9.99</strong></p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — I get to the office and join a technology demo in our boardroom. I’m multi-tasking and end up not listening, I know my team will share the main updates with me next week.</p>



<p>4 p.m. — I get a taxi to daycare with another parent friend who works two blocks from me (she covers the fare). The potluck is chaotic but really nice. I know a few of the parents there just coincidentally (there aren’t many daycare spots in Vancouver), so it’s nice to catch up and see how the new kids are settling in. The watermelon and pineapple are a hit, but I end up losing my Tupperware in the chaos. K. misses most of the fun, but comes to pick us up when he’s finished work.</p>



<p>8:15 p.m. — I supervise D.’s bath time, then hand over to K. for bedtime and walk the dog to the liquor store to buy some weekend beverages for K. and I (three beers, three coolers, one cider). Bedtime takes a while, but I wait up for K. I’m exhausted and know I should go to bed, but he puts on the new Amanda Knox TV show and I end up watching the first episode even though neither of us loves it (though I find her story fascinating). I watch another episode of <em>The Americans</em> and fall asleep after midnight. <strong>$40.48</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $69.27</strong></p>



<h3>Day Four: Saturday</h3>



<p>7:15 a.m. — It’s the weekend! D. slept all night in his own bed and is up early. We all sleep better this way, but the trade-off is that mornings start sooner. We snuggle and chat in bed for half an hour, then I get up, make his breakfast (Eggo waffle and strawberries), and tidy up. It’s an independent play kind of morning, so I watch <em>The Americans</em> while he plays with monster trucks. I suddenly realize I’m starving, so I heat a frozen burrito for breakfast, then head to the gym. I recently joined a women-only gym at the end of my block and while I wish I had the energy to go during the week, I really try on weekends. I do 20-minutes on the treadmill and a full-body weight machine circuit.</p>



<p>10:30 a.m. — I shower and we head to our favorite coffee shop with the dog in tow. I get a large caramel latte and a pastry, K. gets a flat white, and D. has a mini pastry called a kouign-amann. We sit outside and eat, drink, and play with Hot Wheels, and D. gets a second pastry. <strong>$33.13</strong></p>



<p>12 p.m. — On the way home, we stop in at a florist and K. buys a small pearl vine for our plant wall, and I get a free pink rose for following the florist on Instagram. When we get home we go up to the rooftop patio, where we hang out watering the plants in our garden bed and playing with more Hot Wheels. <strong>$4.47</strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — I convince K. we should go to the Pacific National Exhibition (very busy outdoor fair) for its final day on Monday, and I buy tickets on my phone with a 30% discount as a BCAA member. <strong>$67.80</strong></p>



<p>3 p.m. — I’m so tired and just want to nap, but have a pedicure booked as my toenails are a state and I’m not done wearing sandals yet. I watch <em>The Americans</em> on my phone during the appointment. <strong>$62.33</strong></p>



<p>4:30 p.m. — The weather isn’t as hot as hoped, but we go to the outdoor pool anyway, as we have tickets. We have fun splashing around and playing in the shallow end and manage to get dried and dressed without any drama.</p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — We leave the pool and stop off at our local brewery for dinner. K. gets a pint of raspberry sour, I get a 12oz of the same and we attempt a family game of snakes and ladders. The brewery recently partnered with a burger vendor who we love, so I order three cheeseburgers and fries. We share a table with a nice and patient couple who put up with the preschooler screams and give K. a beer that the bartender made them by accident. The portions of fries are absolutely huge and we end up taking a whole box home, along with most of D.’s burger. <strong>$85.80</strong></p>



<p>9 p.m. — Bedtime is chaotic, but D. is tired. He falls asleep soon after 10 p.m. and I go straight to bed.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $253.53</strong></p>



<h3>Day Five: Sunday</h3>



<p>9:15 a.m. — I wake up and am shocked when I see how late it is! D. woke me up coming into our bed in the night and it took me a while to get back to sleep, but the sleep in is worth it. I get up and head to the gym, where I do a short incline walk on the treadmill and a Juice &amp; Toya arms and abs workout on YouTube.</p>



<p>11 a.m. — Home, shower, and out for a walk for coffee and pastries from our usual place. Same order as yesterday — a caramel latte, flat white, pastry, and kouign-amann. K. and D. walk to the grocery store across the street to get started on the weekly shop, while I walk the dog home and drive back down and meet them with the shopping bags. We get all of our usual lunch staples, including bread, bagels, croissants, salad kits, cucumber, berries, shredded cheese, yogurt, broccoli, filled pasta, canned tuna, and kids snacks, plus some Drano. <strong>$222.27</strong></p>



<p>2 p.m. — We have a chill couple of hours at home doing scrap paper crafts and watering the rooftop garden plot. We’re meeting friends at the beach this afternoon, so I pack up our beach bag and throw in some turkey croissants to share, and a piña colada cider I got from Friday’s liquor store run.</p>



<p>4 p.m. — We pick up a friend who lives a few blocks away from us, and make it two minutes before I get a Facebook message from someone on her way to pick some of D.’s old clothes that I’m selling on Marketplace, and have forgotten to leave out — shoot! We go back home and I leave them in my lobby to buzz her in when she arrives. She only takes 1/3 of the clothes but transfers me the full $25. Great! We arrive at the beach and I pay for parking. We meet our other friend, and have the best afternoon together. The four of us met the day we all arrived in Vancouver from the UK almost 15 years ago, and while we don’t get to hang out together as often as we like, we have the best time when we do. We play about on my SUP, take turns chasing D. around, and the non-drivers drink beers. <strong>$14.49</strong></p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — We’re having so much fun and don’t want the day to end, so we all jump in the car and return to the same brewery from last night for more burgers. The burger place said they were open until 9 p.m. on Instagram, but when we arrive they’ve closed an hour early. I shoot them a note letting them know and a crying emoji. We decide we still want burgers, so order takeout on Uber Eats instead and eat on a picnic bench outside. I get two Angus burgers on a BOGOF deal and fries to share, plus a cheeseburger combo meal for D. They’re still pretty good! K. drinks two pints and I stick with water. <strong>$80.23</strong></p>



<p>9:30 p.m. — It’s late and dark, so we pile in the car and I drive our friends home. D. hasn’t napped today, so we play <em>The Lion King</em> in the car to keep him awake. Once we get home, I realize we left the diaper bag at the brewery and make the three-min drive back to get it. K. handles bedtime while I walk the dog and do the briefest of nighttime routines (Sunday Riley Luna Oil and Olay moisturizer). I’m in bed by 11:30 p.m.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $316.99</strong></p>



<h3>Day Six: Monday</h3>



<p>9 a.m. — Wake up squished against D., and scroll for half an hour in peace. The burger place from last night sent me a DM apologizing for the error on hours and offering me a free meal next time I’m there, so nice! D. wakes up and we look through baby photos of him on my phone together until it’s time to get up. There’s sand everywhere from yesterday’s beach adventure and I offer to help K. clean, but he says I won’t do a good enough job and he’d rather do it himself (he’s right). He really struggles when things are out of place, which makes parenting pretty tough. I get out of his way and take the dog for a walk to the coffee shop, where I get our usual order to go, plus a pistachio-pineapple pastry for K. <strong>$30.18</strong></p>



<p>11:30 — We’re finally ready to leave for the fair. A new work friend lives right across the street from the grounds and offered for us to park at her place, so we drive straight there. D. has an accident in the car, so we change his underwear in her driveway when we arrive. He spots the big trampoline in her yard, so we spend ten minutes catching up while he bounces before bribing him with a new Hot Wheels car to leave.</p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — We have a fun afternoon at the fair! D. tries out hockey, basketball, and soccer at the kids’ sport zone, we watch the super dogs and the high divers shows, and D. goes on a few kids’ rides. We manage to limit him to one “prize-guaranteed” fairground game and he chooses a tiny bottle of bubbles as his prize. <strong>$10</strong></p>



<p>3 p.m. — It’s a hot day, so I get a Coke Zero and soft serve ice cream for D. and I. K. skips the ice cream and gets a tuna poke bowl. We stay for a few hours, then manage to make a tantrum-free exit. <strong>$44.87</strong></p>



<p>6 p.m. — We’re home. K. and D. go up to the roof to water the plants while I call TELUS. My internet/TV plan expired a couple of months ago and our bill jumped from $98 a month to $200! I speak to a rep and end up negotiating the same package but with better internet for $78/month, plus a $100 credit to cover the increase in the last two months. D. watches YouTube videos of families playing with monster trucks and starts crying because he doesn’t have a backyard. Sigh. I think he’s incredibly lucky to be growing up in this city and apartment life won’t kill him, while K. really hates that he likely won’t experience living in a house. We redirect him with cartoons and order Indian takeout. <strong>$95.60</strong></p>



<p>9 p.m. — My turn to do bedtime. After some negotiation, D. is asleep by 10. I realize I needed to wash my hair tonight but I’m too tired, so I’ll have to get up early and do it in the morning instead. I head to bed and watch <em>The Americans</em> until I fall asleep.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $180.65</strong></p>



<h3>Day Seven: Tuesday</h3>



<p>7 a.m. — Wake up to my alarm. D. is in our bed again, although I don’t remember him getting in. K. has a rare day off today, so I have a nice long shower, wash and dry my hair, and walk to work with an instant coffee. K. takes D. to pre-school and gets a coffee from Starbucks afterwards. <strong>$4.44</strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — Tuesday is our mandatory “in office” day and it’s a busy one. I work on my quarterly work plan, answer some emails about insurance, and attend our weekly Executive Team meeting. I eat last night’s Indian leftovers at my desk for lunch, which I realize have been in my backpack instead of the refrigerator all morning. It tastes even better the day after. </p>



<p>2:45 p.m. — I have a confidential call with my HR Manager and there are no meeting rooms available, so I head to a coffee shop across the street where no one from work can overhear us. I order a hedgehog mocha and a chocolate walnut cookie. Another colleague wants to meet before the end of the day to discuss some meeting structures, so I make it a “walk-and-talk” around the park so I can make a speedy exit. <strong>$13.49</strong></p>



<p>5:15 p.m. — I’m making the most of K. being on daycare pick-up duty and meet friends for happy hour! We try a new spot that’s only a 10-minute walk from my office. It’s bar service, and I know that once we sit down and start chatting, I won’t want to get up again, so I order two happy our tequila and Sprites up front. After catching up, we Uber to a liquor store (my friend pays). I don’t buy anything as I brought my last two coolers from home, then we walk to meet two more friends at the beach. <strong>$12.56</strong></p>



<p>7 p.m. — I have the best evening! We order delicious pizza ($30 each), drink delicious drinks, and don’t stop talking for hours. We’re all British, and all parents of under-fives who met on the Peanut app a few years ago while we were on maternity leave. We talk about the highs and lows of parenting, vent about our partners, and discuss the best spicy romantasy books. It’s a beautiful sunset and I wade into the ocean just to get my feet wet. <strong>$30.00</strong></p>



<p>10 p.m. — I share an Uber home with the friend who paid earlier, so I get this one. <strong>$8.00</strong></p>



<p>10:15 p.m. — D. is already in bed when I get home; he and K. went to a brewery after daycare and got a pint and an apple juice plus parking. I take the dog out and get ready for bed. D. wakes up and hears me and asks to sleep in my bed. I’ve missed him after all the parenting talk tonight, so after some half-hearted efforts to re-settle him, I say yes, and we fall asleep together around 11. <strong>$18.69</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $87.18</strong></p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p><br />This was a pretty average week, and even though it was a long weekend, which meant some extra spending, we spent a lot less than we would have if we’d gone to Whistler for the weekend, so that was a good choice. I’ve known for a while that I could save a lot more money if we cut down on coffees and happy hours/takeout, and recording my expenses did make me very aware of that — and skip a couple of cookies! However, I don’t really have any sort of goal to motivate my savings right now, so it’s easier to just choose enjoying life in the moment. I’m sure that will change in the future, and I know there are areas I can cut back on if I need to.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11888777.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Time stands still for no one, or so the planet Saturn teaches us. Saturn is leading us into Aries on February 13th. As we move onward in life, the austere and reverent cosmic force urges us to be responsible and ambitious as we grow. Along the way, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/may-2025-monthly-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Saturn will present obstacles</a> and it’s up to us to find the best path forward. </p>



<p>Saturn is a dominant planet that likes to take charge and Aries is the zodiac sign that is self-reliant. When the two collide, we may focus on how we can solely advance ourselves rather than on helping others. Saturn is exalted in Libra, which is the opposite sign of Aries, and commits to being a team player. This means that when Saturn is in Aries, the planet is in detriment and urges us to be selfish. As a result, struggles can occur along the way. Saturn in Aries can be a complex combination because the fire sign is impulsive, and the planet itself is known to be strategic. When these two come together, it can make us question how to take action.</p>



<p>Saturn in Aries can be a tad immature. Rather than learning and moving on with the knowledge and insight the universe gives us, we may still chase the same challenges and opportunities (until we decide to move on). Even though we know instinctively that the “white whale” is unobtainable, it’ll still be lingering in our minds until we reach that goal. This could hinder us from growing and evolving into the next stage of life. Aries is a zodiac sign that won’t and can’t stop until it wins; Saturn gives it the extra determination to do so. We can still achieve greatness, it’ll just require extra effort. As long as we’re up for the task, then we should be able to thrive.</p>



<p>Saturn’s stint in Aries is unique because Neptune is transiting the same sign and moving closely with Saturn. The two planets will form a conjunction on February 20th, 2026. This magical time encourages us to reach for the stars and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/manifest-goals-2025-zodiac-signs"">manifest our dreams</a>. Saturn cements Neptune’s aspirations, making it a decisive moment in time. These two planets haven’t aligned in Aries in centuries. </p>



<p>Although the centaur Chiron will be far away by a degree, we’ll still feel the lingering energy in the same sign as Saturn. Chiron helps us heal, and Saturn helps us acknowledge the lesson. We can transcend internally by mending our trauma at this time. The growing pains might be challenging; however, we’ll face our shadow selves and embrace our fears, squashing them as we move toward enlightenment.</p>



<p>Those born on the dates below will be experiencing their Saturn returns, making it a transformative time. For those not in the know, the Saturn return is when the planet returns to the sign and degree it was when you were born, every 27 to 30 years. The first one teaches us how to adult, the second journey urges us to embrace our success, and the third Saturn return is a moment of reflection. Reference the dates below to see if you qualify: </p>



<p>Apr 25, 1937, to Oct 17, 1937</p>



<p>Jan 14, 1938, to Jul  6, 1939</p>



<p>Sep 22, 1939, to Mar 20, 1940</p>



<p>Mar  3, 1967, to Apr 29, 1969</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958724.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>I can pinpoint the exact moment I knew I had to do something about my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/02/10865365/masseter-reduction-botox-cost-effects"">jaw pain</a>. It was my birthday, and a friend cracked a joke so good that half the drinks on the table toppled as everyone doubled over laughing. I, meanwhile, could barely move my mouth; smiling, talking, even laughing felt like lifting weights with my face.  </p>



<p>That’s why I owe a lot to a beauty editor friend of mine, who told me she’d been in the same boat — and that masseter Botox, injected into the masseter muscle along the lower jaw, had completely changed her life.  </p>



<p>Within hours of talking to her, I’d booked an appointment with the injector she swore by, and a week later, I could eat, speak, and laugh again without my jaw snapping shut. The pain and tension — probably from stress-induced teeth clenching — had vanished, and I finally felt human again. But as I enjoyed my newfound freedom, I noticed a subtle change in my face. It had a slightly more oval shape, and I’m convinced the skin along my jaw felt a little looser than before. My experience isn’t unique — but it does raise some important questions. </p>



<h2>What is masseter Botox, and what are the benefits and downsides? </h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/preventative-botox-wrinkles-scam-myth"">While Botox</a> — a purified neurotoxin — is widely used for smoothing <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-gf-solution-serum-review"">fine lines and wrinkles</a> by relaxing the muscles underneath the skin, more experts are recommending it as a solution for jaw pain, clenching, teeth grinding, tension, and clicking. Conversation around it is booming. On TikTok, the <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/tag/masseterbotox?lang=en"">hashtag #masseterbotox</a> has amassed 158 million views and counting, with both experts and patients sharing their experiences. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>As searches for masseter Botox increase, many people are also googling whether it can cause jowls.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p><a href=""https://nycfacedoc.com/"">Dr. Moustafa Mourad, MD, FACS</a>, a double board-certified facial plastic surgeon and masseter Botox expert, who did not perform my treatment, describes it first and foremost as a treatment with real functional benefits: “An aesthetic effect is a secondary bonus,” says Dr. Mourad. “Masseter Botox can be incredibly helpful for patients who clench or grind their teeth, deal with chronic jaw tension, or feel jaw pain and fatigue by the end of the day,” he adds. “By relaxing an overactive masseter, we’re reducing the force transmitted through the jaw and teeth, which often translates into less pain, less tightness, and fewer tension headaches.” </p>



<p>But it would be remiss not to acknowledge the aesthetics of it all. Dr. Mourad confirms that masseter Botox can reduce muscle volume. “When it’s done thoughtfully, this can create a more tapered lower face, which is why it’s popular in patients with true masseter hypertrophy,” he says — essentially an enlarged jaw muscle that affects the natural shape of your face. In my case, I had been grinding my teeth for so long that my masseter had become large and strong, giving my jawline a sharper, more rigid appearance.  </p>



<h2>Can masseter Botox give you jowls?  </h2>



<p>A more oval face isn’t the only change I noticed. I’m almost certain that masseter Botox contributed to a very slight shift in skin texture, making it look and feel a little looser — something I picked up on myself, rather than anything anyone else noticed. To the naked eye, the change was very minimal, but I’m not alone in this observation. As searches for masseter Botox increase, more people are also googling whether it can cause “jowls” or sagging skin along the jawline.</p>



<p>Dr. Mourad tells me that “jowling” after masseter Botox is not caused by Botox damaging the skin: “Rather, it is related to changes in facial support over time,” he explains. Loose skin isn’t something Dr. Mourad typically sees after one, two, or even three treatments. “It is more commonly seen in patients who have been receiving masseter Botox chronically over many years,” he tells me, adding that it’s only with sustained relaxation that true muscle shrinkage can potentially change the shape of the lower face. “[In this case], instead of a more defined, angular jaw contour, the lower face may appear softer and rounder,” he says. </p>



<p>In fact, Dr. Mourad notes that he usually only sees looser skin after masseter Botox in patients who already have existing skin laxity or are experiencing age-related collagen loss — a completely normal part of aging. In other words, the Botox itself is rarely, if ever, the cause.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958793.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>If you’re concerned, it’s worth seeing a qualified injector who really knows their stuff. Dr. Mourad says that in many cases, the risk of jowls can be minimized with careful planning and restraint.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2>If jowls develop after masseter Botox, can they be reversed? </h2>



<p>Unlike filler, which you can dissolve if you don’t like it, Botox can’t be undone. It does wear off eventually, and the muscle goes back to normal, but that can take up to six months. Dr. Mourad says that as the muscle returns, some support can come back, too, which has been the case in my experience. With chronic atrophy, though, it could leave the lower face looking rounder and loose skin more noticeable.  </p>



<p>If you’re concerned, it’s worth seeing a qualified injector who really knows their stuff. Dr. Mourad says that in many cases, the risk of loose skin can be minimized with careful planning and restraint. “I am very deliberate about dosing and treatment frequency,” he says, stressing the importance of not over-weakening the muscle, spacing treatments properly, and reassessing the face over time. </p>



<p>He also evaluates each patient’s facial structure and the quality of their skin on their lower face before recommending long-term masseter Botox treatment. “In some patients, especially those who are aging or already showing early jowling, I will limit the use of masseter Botox or recommend alternative approaches to managing jaw pain that do not contribute to progressive muscle atrophy,” he adds. </p>



<p>If you’re committed to masseter Botox but have noticed some skin sagging and want to address it, Dr. Mourad suggests considering other treatments, like jawline filler or skin-tightening options <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dermatologist-skincare-advice-2026"">such as lasers</a>. </p>



<h2>Besides jowls, are there other long-term side effects of masseter Botox?  </h2>



<p>Dr. Mourad says that most other side effects of masseter Botox are mild and temporary, but it must be performed by a qualified injector. “Patients may experience localized soreness, swelling, or bruising, and some notice temporary difficulty chewing very hard foods as the muscle weakens,” he explains. Less common, but still possible — especially in underqualified hands — is the toxin spreading into nearby muscles, which can lead to temporary asymmetry, like a slightly altered smile, he adds. </p>



<p>While Dr. Mourad is a big fan of masseter Botox treatment — especially for relieving pain and tension — he emphasizes the importance of using it thoughtfully. “It should be revisited regularly, and not approached as an indefinite routine maintenance treatment,” he concludes. </p>



<p>I’ll definitely try masseter Botox again. We’re living in a stressful world, and for me, teeth grinding has become part of the deal. Next time, though, I’ll ask for a lighter touch — and work harder at managing my stress. Any subtle changes to my face shape are a trade-off I’ll take over the pain of constant clenching; like most treatments, it’s about weighing up the pros and cons. And yes, I’d still recommend it. It can be truly life-changing.</p>

I knew instantly that I had to have it, and it’s all down to the “solar” notes — scents that create a warm, fuzzy feeling, as though you’re basking in sunlight. The first spritz is fizzy, with a squeeze of citrusy bergamot and yuzu, before drying down into a creamy, nuzzly, skin-like scent thanks to jasmine, comforting vanilla, nutty tonka bean, and neroli — the fragrant oil extracted from the flowers of the bitter orange tree.

Powdery violet, lush rose, all-encompassing incense, and heady patchouli make it a scent that demands attention, while delicate white tea and creamy cedarwood linger softly on the skin as the day goes on. <br /><br /><strong>Le Labo</strong> Violette 30 Eau de Parfum, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fviolette-30-eau-de-parfum%2F8802119%3F"">Nordstrom</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1104"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958631.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1328&amp;height=1104&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=83:69"" width=""1328"" /><figcaption><h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fsublime-eau-de-toilette%2F8754105"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tory Burch Sublime Eau de Toilette, $138 <br /></a></h2><br />If you think you don’t like floral fragrances, this will make you think twice.

The first spray sparks as much joy as the first sip of a passionfruit martini, but while the opening is tart and zingy, the dry down is where it truly shines.

<p>When <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-no-me-quiero-ir-de-aqui-residency-outfits"">Bad Bunny</a> leaped off the Levi’s Stadium field in Santa Clara, California, ending his 13-minute <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/02/10868981/super-bowl-2022-halftime-show-racism"">Super Bowl halftime show</a> chanting the lyrics of “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9T_MGfzq7I&amp;list=RDv9T_MGfzq7I&amp;start_radio=1"">DtMF</a>,” the stadium erupted in fireworks. More than 2,800 miles away in Orlando, Florida, I saw the sky outside my window light up, too, flashing in brief bursts of color. In a city with one of the largest Puerto Rican populations in the contiguous U.S., some shop-owners shut their doors early so they could catch the show together with their families, others kept the lights on well into the night to host sold-out Benito Bowl watch parties, and others took to neighborhood roads, dancing with friends under street lights or illuminating entire neighborhoods with light shows. From the rolling hills of northwest California to the low wetlands of the Southeast U.S., we, distant neighbors, celebrated like patriots commemorating our beginning — because, for the millions of us who trace our histories across the American continent, we were.</p>



<p>For the estimated <a href=""https://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/life/2026/02/09/how-many-people-watch-the-halftime-show-2026-bad-bunny/88589346007/"">135.4 to 142 million viewers</a> who tuned in globally — figures that would make Bad Bunny’s halftime show the most-watched in history — it was an invitation to reclaim what it means to be an American, an identity and inheritance that for too long has been hegemonized by the U.S., even though it belongs to an entire continent.</p>



<p>After an energetic performance of a medley of hits like “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cr8K88UcO0s&amp;list=RDCr8K88UcO0s&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUbYmFkIGJ1bm55IFRpdMOtIE1lIFByZWd1bnRvoAcB"">Tití Me Pregunto</a>,” “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtSRKwDCaZM&amp;list=RDGtSRKwDCaZM&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUYYmFkIGJ1bm55IFlvIFBlcnJlbyBTb2xhoAcB"">Yo Perreo Sola</a>,” “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCQ_6XbATPc&amp;list=RDjCQ_6XbATPc&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygURYmFkIGJ1bm55IFNhZmFlcmGgBwE%3D"">Safaera</a>,” “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9XrXnfJPsk&amp;list=RDG9XrXnfJPsk&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUPYmFkIGJ1bm55IFBhcnR5oAcB"">Party</a>,” “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2MGCIDOMZ4&amp;list=RDX2MGCIDOMZ4&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUeYmFkIGJ1bm55IFZveSBhIExsZXZhcnRlIFBhIFBSoAcB"">Voy a Llevarte Pa PR</a>,” “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myDIeOjqQos&amp;list=RDmyDIeOjqQos&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUNYmFkIGJ1bm55IEVvT6AHAQ%3D%3D"">EoO</a>,” and “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PJvpq8uOZM&amp;list=RD_PJvpq8uOZM&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUQYmFkIGJ1bm55IE1vbmFjb6AHAQ%3D%3D"">Monaco</a>,” to name a few, Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, ended his performance invoking “God Bless America.” It was the first English words he uttered during a halftime show that was historic, in part, because it was the first in the NFL’s 60-year run to ever be performed predominantly in Spanish. With the flags of Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago, Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, and the U.S., among others, waving behind him, the Puerto Rican rapper then went on to name countries across the Caribbean and South, Central, and North Americas. When he ended with “my motherland, mi patria, Puerto Rico,” he cemented his performance, like a victorious touchdown, with a football stamped with the words, “Together, We Are America.” It was a message for all of us, those who have always traced their roots to the region, those who arrived centuries ago, violently and forcefully, on ships, and those who, generation after generation, have migrated to this corner of the world carrying a dream.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958687.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA – FEBRUARY 8: Bad Bunny performs in the Apple Music Halftime Show during the NFL Super Bowl 60 football game between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots, at Levi’s Stadium on February 8, 2026 in Santa Clara, California.

<p>The words, the flags, and the faces of racially and ethnically diverse people encircling the Grammy award-winning artist sent a message to President Donald Trump and the ultra-conservative, who <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-super-bowl-maga-backlash"">boycotted Bad Bunny’s halftime show</a> because of the rapper’s cultural identity and pro-immigrant politics: America is a continent, and his rendering of “God bless America” is a prayer for the people of every nation that stretches across it, not just the white U.S. citizens who have long positioned themselves as the primary beneficiaries of the label and land.</p>



<p>Transitioning to his native tongue to complete the blessing, like any other Latine church kid who speaks in English but prays in Spanish, Martínez Ocasio intoned an even more important invocation for migrants and their descendants: “seguimos aquí” — “we are still here” — a popular Puerto Rican refrain that marks our survival, presence, and refusal amid generations of political and natural disasters. </p>



<p>Some who boycotted the performance tuned into an alternative halftime entertainment event, the “All-American Halftime Show,” organized by the conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA. It aired live online at the same time as the NFL’s official halftime show, explicitly positioned as a protest of Bad Bunny’s performance. Roughly five million viewers (a fraction of the audience that watched Benito Bowl) tuned in to watch little-known country and rock artists like Kid Rock, Brantley Gilbert, Lee Brice, and Gabby Barrett. To them, Martínez Ocasio’s identity as a Puerto Rican artist, his use of his native Spanish, and his belief that “the only thing more powerful than hate is love” were framed as a threat to white American notions of “faith, family, and freedom.” </p>



<p>Ironically, it is the people of Puerto Rico, a U.S. colonial territory, who have been calling for freedom since the U.S. seized the archipelago in 1898. Their cries reverberated throughout Bad Bunny’s performance. </p>



<p>Bad Bunny commenced his historic performance with a stage set evoking Puerto Rican history, beginning with the brutal legacy of Spanish imperialism on the island. A man wearing a pava hat — the traditional hat of Puerto Rican agricultural workers, lovingly called jíbaros — strums the opening notes of “Tití Me Preguntó” and declares, “Qué rico es ser Latino.” Behind him stand sugarcane fields, where enslaved Africans and Indigenous Taínos as well as poor criollos once labored, enriching the pockets of the island’s first colonizers and giving rise to a shared Puerto Rican identity rooted in communal power and resistance to colonial systems.</p>



<p>Seconds later, Bad Bunny’s baritone resonates across the fields. Dressed in a cream collared shirt and tie, a sport-inspired jersey bearing his family name, Ocasio, and the number 64 (representing the birth year of his mother, Lysaurie Ocasio), and his signature BadBo 1.0 Adidas sneakers, he is flanked by actors: some, wearing pava hats, embody those Puerto Rican farmworkers of the past, while others dress in modern farmwear, portraying the contemporary Latine laborers who continue to toil across the harsh agricultural landscapes of the U.S. All of them hold machetes, a tool once wielded by formerly enslaved people to revolt against colonizers across the Caribbean.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958686.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>TOPSHOT – Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny performs during Super Bowl LX Patriots vs Seahawks Apple Music Halftime Show at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California on February 8, 2026.

<p>As he dances through the sugarcane fields, Bad Bunny brings us with him to modern-day Puerto Rico. Vendors sell coco frio, welitos play dominos, Black and brown women adorn themselves at a nail salon, and workers continue to rebuild after the devastation of Hurricane María. Benito then cools off from the blazing Caribbean sun with a piragua and tacos from the beloved L.A. taco shop, Villas Tacos, a nod to the street vendors across California and the U.S. who have been targeted and harassed amid Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) crackdowns. </p>



<p>Some of the scenes he portrays are painful, but there’s joy in his resistance and power in our cultural art forms and entertainment. Watching Bad Bunny evade punches from Puerto Rican boxer Xander Zayas and Mexican boxer Emiliano Vargas evokes the pride our families feel in our living rooms, watching our people represent us in sport. Seeing Latine artists like Cardi B, Karol G, Pedro Pascal, Young Miko, and Jessica Alba dancing en la casita — a life-size replica of a traditional pink Puerto Rican house that Bad Bunny has used as a stage during his historic 31-day <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-no-me-quiero-ir-de-aqui-residency-outfits"">“No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí residency”</a> in Puerto Rico and on his Debí Tirar Más Fotos World Tour to symbolize a pari de marquesina, those Caribbean garage parties nostalgic to so many of us — summons us to move through the structural violence we continue to endure with dance, too, just as our ancestors did. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958682.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA – FEBRUARY 08: Musician Bad Bunny performs during the Apple Music halftime show at the NFL Super Bowl LX football game between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots at Levi Stadium on February 8, 2026 in Santa Clara, California.

<p>But instead of bomba and plena, traditional Afro-Puerto Rican musical genres born from protest and community, women in khaki miniskorts shake their asses as Bad Bunny raps the lyrics to his reggaeton hit “Yo Perreo Sola,” a song about bodily autonomy, independence, and the right to dance without harassment. “Las mujeres en el mundo entero, perreando sin miedo,” he says, assuring women everywhere they have the space to move freely and safely in the show he’s created. Bad Bunny then transitions smoothly into “Safaera,” where we, global fans, sing the words to a sexually explicit, and empowered, song he can’t rap on the largest stage in the world: “Si tu novio no te mama,” he sings, as countless viewers yell back, “el culo, pa eso que no mame. Baja pa casa que yo te lambo toa. Mami, yo te lambo toa.”</p>



<p>Welcoming millions of watchers to “la fiesta más grande en el mundo entero,” Bad Bunny knows his halftime performance will break streaming records. He has shattered records throughout his career, becoming <a href=""https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-12-03/wrapped-bad-bunny-top-artist-album/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Spotify’s most-streamed artist worldwide</a> in 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2025 and <a href=""https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-latin/bad-bunny-breaks-record-most-watched-amazon-music-stream-1235432020/"">surpassing Amazon Music’s live-streamed concerts</a> during his “No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí: Una Más” finale. That’s because, as the world now knows, no one parties quite like folks from the Caribbean. There is protest, resilience, and freedom in the dips, sways, and wines that <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-calls-bad-bunnys-super-bowl-halftime-show/story?id=129980124"">Trump labeled “disgusting.”</a> And through his performance of “VOY A LLeVARTE PA PR,” the Grammy award-winning “EoO,” and a medley tribute to reggaeton pioneers like Tego Calderón, Don Omar, and Daddy Yankee, Bad Bunny invites the world to perrear como una puertorriqueña, to learn history and dance through Puerto Rican rhythms. </p>



<p>Ahead of his halftime show, Bad Bunny emphasized that language wouldn’t be a barrier to enjoying his performance. Speaking with Apple Music Radio hosts Zane Lowe and Ebro Darden at the <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2026/02/06/nx-s1-5563906/bad-bunny-super-bowl-performance-predictions"">Super Bowl LX Halftime Show Press Conference</a>, Martínez Ocasio urged those who’d be watching to dance from the heart, to relish a “heartbeat dance” — and heart was at the center of the entire show. </p>



<p>There was the moment Bad Bunny stared into a camera, pointed at the viewers watching from television sets, laptop screens, and portable projectors, and encouraged them to always believe in themselves because they are worth more than they know. There was the couple, kissing after “I do” in a white wedding gown and tuxedo, who <a href=""https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/47872442/bad-bunny-super-bowl-lx-half-wedding"">legally married during the halftime show</a>. There was Lady Gaga, one of Bad Bunny’s favorite artists, and Los Sobrinos, a Puerto Rican band who played on his most recent album, <em><a href=""https://music.apple.com/us/album/deb%C3%AD-tirar-m%C3%A1s-fotos/1787022393"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS</a></em>, performing a salsa rendition of “Die With a Smile” as the newlyweds shared their wedding cake. And when Bad Bunny returned to the mic, there were moments of cross-generational care. First, while singing his hit “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1Femq4NPxs&amp;list=RDa1Femq4NPxs&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUbYmFkIGJ1bm55IEJBSUxFIElOb0xWSURBQkxFoAcB"">BAILE INoLVIDABLE</a>,” he gently woke a child sleeping on two seats, an experience every Latine who grew up going to family parties that stretch well into the night knows. Then, during “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU5V5WZVcVE&amp;list=RDKU5V5WZVcVE&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUTYmFkIGJ1bm55IE51ZXZhIFlvbKAHAQ%3D%3D"">Nueva Yol</a>,” he gifted a child his Album of the Year Grammy trophy, kneeling to the ground, and whispering to him, “Cree siempre en ti.” The boy symbolizes Bad Bunny’s own inner child, Latine youth across the diaspora, and, perhaps, even <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/US/administration-seeking-expedited-removal-5-year-family-rep/story?id=129918648"">Liam Conejo Ramos</a>, the five-year-old Ecuadorian boy who was detained by ICE in Minnesota while coming home from school.</p>

<p>But Martínez Ocasio’s heart danced most passionately for his homeland — and for Puerto Ricans, whose population in the contiguous U.S. outnumbers that in the archipelago, home is often experienced differently, though no less authentically, throughout the diaspora. In “Nueva Yol,” Benito takes us to a Puerto Rican neighborhood in the Big Apple, with Puerto Rican flags hanging from store windows, women braiding each other’s hair outside of a barber shop, Brooklyn’s own Toñita, the beloved owner of the community anchor Caribbean Social Club, handing him a shot of rum, and Boricuas of every shade dancing in the street to a genre their Nuyorican ancestors co-created. </p>



<p>Ricky Martin then takes us back to Puerto Rico, now to the rural mountains, where he reinterprets Ocasio Martínez’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvfDaZ4ZT80&amp;list=RDuvfDaZ4ZT80&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUgYmFkIGJ1bm55IExvIFF1ZSBQYXPDsyBlbiBIYXdhaWmgBwE%3D"">Lo Que Pasó en Hawaii</a>,” a protest song against U.S. colonialism in Puerto Rico and a call to its people to fight to preserve land, heritage, and culture at a time when tourism-driven colonial pressures aim to reshape the island. When Bad Bunny returns to the mic, it’s to perform “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdQEljUMCEM&amp;list=RDQdQEljUMCEM&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUUYmFkIGJ1bm55IEVsIEFwYWfDs26gBwE%3D"">El Apagón</a>,” a sharply political song that uses the debilitating power outages in Puerto Rico to critique government corruption and displacement. Carrying a Puerto Rican flag and, at one point, scaling a sparking utility pole, Bad Bunny, through the song, urges Puerto Ricans to fight for the future and sovereignty of their land and people.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958688.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=682&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A341"" /><figcaption>SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA – FEBRUARY 08: Bad Bunny performs onstage during the Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show at Levi’s Stadium on February 08, 2026 in Santa Clara, California.

<p>But as the music shifts from electro-reggaeton to plena, traditional Puerto Rican folk music, Bad Bunny extends his call. Walking off a set design of Puerto Rico that, in itself, should garner awards, and symbolically into the homes of those watching across the Americas, he names each country that makes up the Caribbean, South America, Central America, and North America — urging us all to reimagine American-ness, no longer restricted to the U.S.’s linguistic hegemony or make-believe colonial borders. Bound by shared histories, cultures, and resilience, he invites us to claim belonging and community that transcends nation-states and challenges centuries of imposed divisions.</p>



<p>This, of course, is the greatest threat to the ultra-right. It’s why Turning Point produced the All-American Halftime Show. It fears not just Bad Bunny but what his artistry is capable of: reimagination. </p>



<p>Through history, education, joy, dance, pleasure, and love, Bad Bunny’s music allows us to envision another reality — one where we, as marginalized people, understand our power and our worth, and where we fight lovingly for our undocumented neighbor in the house next door and for those enduring state repression in neighboring countries. </p>



<p>This is the cross-continental America we can create, the one where solidarity, justice, and dignity prevail for all of us, the one worth putting our hearts into and illuminating our skies for. After all, as Martínez Ocasio noted in a jumbotron during his final performance: “the only thing more powerful than hate is love.” <br /></p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958068.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>From the very beginning, <strong><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sabrinaelba/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sabrina Elba</a></strong> has been clear about who she is creating for. In this episode of <em>Go Off, Sis</em> sponsored by <strong><a href=""https://www.target.com/c/celebrate-black-history-month/-/N-bw2fb"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Target</a></strong> and its Black History Month collection, which spotlights Black founders building with community in mind, the <strong><a href=""https://sablelabs.co/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22847971116&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAoySwxa6rLOwHWVWAJcsScPLRC9lL&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA1czLBhDhARIsAIEc7uj5Kp50Tl2ZVUdqaZx83ZYTNqfBs6Q8LybIEocgYKH2ipcnetAgRzsaAsi-EALw_wcB"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">S’ABLE Labs</a></strong> co-founder breaks down what it means to build beauty intentionally, ethically, and with communities of color at the center rather than the margins.</p>



<p>At the heart of Elba’s approach is what she calls “A beauty,” a term rooted in African beauty knowledge passed down across generations. “It’s the passing down of knowledge, traditions, ingredients, customs, throughout the whole continent of Africa,” she explains. That history is not just inspiration. It is a framework for how she builds. African botanicals like shea, Black soap, and rooibos come from some of the world’s harshest climates, which Elba says makes them especially powerful for skincare. For Elba, purpose lives in how those ingredients are used, not just where they come from. </p>



<p>Purpose also shows up in how those ingredients are formulated. Elba is intentional about pairing traditional African botanicals with modern skincare science, creating products designed to support melanin-rich skin without irritation. “Everything is fragrance free,” she says. “I don’t want to irritate skin that has gone through it.” Her philosophy reflects a belief that starting with more sensitive, inflammation-prone skin leads to better products overall.</p>



<p>That mindset was shaped by personal experience. As a teenager, Elba struggled with products that damaged her skin barrier and failed to meet her needs. “It’s part of the reason I’m so frustrated with the beauty industry, frustrated enough to start a brand,” she says. Rather than adapting to what existed, she chose to build something new with intention.</p>



<p>Elba’s purpose extends beyond formulation into how her brand operates. As a UN Goodwill Ambassador, she brings the same care to sourcing, working directly with farming communities across Africa and prioritizing transparency, fair wages, and safe working conditions. “If a product doesn’t tell you where those ingredients are coming from, we need to question that,” she says. It is an approach that aligns closely with Target’s <em>Made With Purpose</em> initiative, where ethical practices are treated as essential, not optional.</p>



<p>The beauty founder also pushes back on the narrow way Black-founded brands are often framed. “You haven’t created a Black product,” she says. “You’ve created a better product period.” Starting with communities of color, she argues, raises the bar for the entire industry.</p>



<p>Listen to the full <em>Go Off, Sis</em> episode to hear Elba chat with Senior Content Director of Entertainment at Refinery29/Unbothered, Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Brand Partnerships Lead at Unbothered, Sandy Pierre, and Social Strategist at Unbothered, Jessika Hardy, about African beauty knowledge, clean formulation, and why the industry still has catching up to do.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958198.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>In the midst of all the chaos going on in the world, it’s nice to know that Venus in Pisces is bringing us a fairytale vibe. Venus in Pisces, which lasts from February 10th to March 6th 2026, is pulling out all the lovely stops, allowing us to feel confident in ourselves as well as relationships (both platonic and romantic). This is a moment of gentleness. We are finding solace and comfort through intimacy in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-lookbook-editor-letter-2025"">the depths of winter</a>. Whether we’re involved with others or not, it’ll be easy to feel the warmth and kindness regardless.</p>



<p>Venus in Pisces is in its “exaltation,” meaning the position of the planet in the water sign is favorable. The reason Venus thrives in Pisces is that the planet yearns to be unconditional, adaptable, tender, and creative. Venus in Pisces is all that and more — encouraging people to be forgiving and sacrificing for others. This transit encourages us to lead with the heart, ask questions later, and to understand those we care about through compassion. At times, Venus in Pisces can make us idealistic, but it’s only that we want to believe in the fantasy we set in our minds about what partnerships should be and look like. Anything less than that won’t suffice.  </p>



<p>On occasion, Venus in Pisces can be a tad mischievous, since the water sign is a mutable sign and absorbs the energy around it. People could take advantage of our goodwill, demanding more without reciprocating, and in turn, pushing us to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/casual-relationship-rules-boundaries"">call for boundaries.</a> Therefore, we have to be careful about what we allow in our lives and the quality of people we associate with. Be mindful of those who aren’t serving us anymore. </p>



<p>This time around, Venus in Pisces encourages us to be dreamy and artistic. Eclipse season and Mercury retrograde cross paths with Venus in Pisces, pushing us to focus on camaraderie and self-care more than anything else. Aligning with partners that are on the same page won’t be hard, although our desires are currently evolving and in flux. Three major aspects are essential to defining how Venus in Pisces will affect us. Fortunately, the North Node of Destiny, Jupiter, and Uranus are cultivating greatness for everyone. </p>



<p>Embrace switching up your style, if you want to. If you do, then use the weeks before February 26th, when Mercury turns retrograde, to ensure no regrets.</p>



<p>On February 17th, the same day as the Lunar New Year and annular solar eclipse in Aquarius, Venus aligns with the North Node of Destiny in Pisces. The karmic moment makes us more passionate and optimistic about relationships. Our confidence is high, pushing us to shoot our shot when it comes to asking out our crush, evolving commitments, and trying a new approach to dating. Since we’re feeling ourselves, we will not shy away from being bold and experimenting with different styles of expression, even acting through a leap of faith and believing the best in those we care about, regardless <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dating-red-flags"">of the red flags</a>.</p>



<p>Venus and Jupiter in Cancer bring luck on February 22nd. Both planets are two of the “greater benefics,” bringing positive energy and favorable news. Together, they can refine our ethics, promise abundance, offer security, and intensify our rizz. It encourages us to strive for the good life. We must listen to our gut. Intuition can be a lifesaver — now, more than ever. </p>



<p>Uranus in Taurus adds a streak of wildness and excitement to Venus’s cosmic mix on March 4th. If a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-situationship-relationship-dating-lessons"">situationship isn’t working</a>, we aren’t going to allow it to bring us down. We’ll break out and be free, helping us soar on the wings of love with someone who is worthy of our time. This could also mean that we are dating against our type to insert freshness into dating. And we lived happily ever after? Fingers crossed!</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958552.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>We know where <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/04/196438/nina-simone-rock-hall-induction-beyonce-tribute-lauryn-hill-sister-rosetta-tharpe"">Nina Simone</a> stood on political and social issues because she told us, vehemently, loudly, and often. She told us in her music with songs like “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ25-U3jNWM"">Mississippi Goddamn</a>” and her cover of “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-vBga68Xdc"">Strange Fruit</a>,” two songs about lynching and the brutalization of Black folks during the civil rights era. Simone made art like her purpose was pulsing through her, coursing through her veins and embedded in her bloodstream. It spilled out because it had to, she <em>had</em> to tell the world how she saw it and how it ought to be. <a href=""https://tribunemag.co.uk/2021/04/the-radical-politics-of-nina-simone"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">She told us explicitly</a> through quotes like the one that’s been making its rounds on social media lately: “An artist’s duty, as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times,” Simone said in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99V0mMNf5fo"">an interview from the ‘60s</a><em>. </em>“How can you be an artist and NOT reflect the times? That to me is the definition of an artist.”</p>



<p>The quote has been used so much it’s been flattened into a meme and lost some of its impact. But it’s never been more true that there are few artists in 2026 who are as committed to reflecting the times. Sixty years after Simone, then one of  the most notable singers in the world, used her voice to denounce systemic racism, critique capitalism, and unequivocally support the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/02/190444/black-panther-movies"">Black Panthers</a> and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/black-panther-style"">Black Power movement</a>, it’s hard to imagine more than a couple famous singers of her stature being as specific, bold, and unflinching in their activism and political outspokenness — within their music and outside of it. Silence is the standard. Sure, there are a few exceptions and after the Grammys, when multiple artists did speak out against <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/07/205854/abolish-ice-origins-twitter-undocumented-immigrants"">ICE (the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)</a>, and <a href=""https://www.newsweek.com/super-bowl-2026-bad-bunny-political-references-halftime-show-11487269"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bad Bunny’s blistering Super Bowl performance,</a> the energy seems to have shifted slightly. <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/bad-bunny-super-bowl-halftime-grammy-boy/story?id=129980775"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bad Bunny</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTCn2cmfEgA"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kehlani</a>, <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/best-new-artist-grammys-lost-brits-1236174909/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Olivia Dean,</a> <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2026-02-04/shaboozey-responds-grammys-speech-backlash"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shaboozey</a>, <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/sza-ice-grammys-1236170851/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">SZA</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2UnPnOYHNM"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Billie Eilish</a> all used their platforms at the Grammys to talk about how <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/presidential-debate-trump-harris-immigration"">ICE is dehumanizing immigrants</a> and terrorizing American communities. </p>



<p>To varying degrees of eloquence and effectiveness, these artists attempted to meet the moment at the Grammys, which came just a week after anti-ICE demonstrations erupted across the U.S. to protest the killings of <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/minneapolis-transformed-federal-immigration-alex-pretti-renee-good-rcna256032"">Renee Good and Alex Pretti</a> in Minneapolis by ICE agents. People are being ripped from their homes, killed in the streets, and rights are being stipped away in real time. It didn’t start with these two murders, but like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/05/11402306/george-floyd-anniversary-jordan-neely-death"">George Floyd’s murder </a>in 2020, we’re at an inflection point where people are finally, collectively saying ENOUGH. The celebrity statements at the Grammys were met with overwhelming support online and applause from the audience, like everyone was waiting for celebrities to finally <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2026/01/11954261/golden-globes-celebrity-pins-meaning-politics-speeches"">stop treating awards shows like it’s business as usual</a> and capitalize on the attention that comes with the stages they are afforded. For better and for worse, people want public figures to show us their values, to tell us where they stand, and if they have to engage in the pomp and circumstance of red carpets and awards shows while the world burns, the least they can do is acknowledge the flames.  </p>



<p>On the red carpet for the Golden Globes last month, I asked<em> <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTZH-OXCTkA/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Poker Face</a></em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTZH-OXCTkA/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> star Natasha Lyonne</a> about the “ICE OUT” pin she was wearing. She mentioned Renee Good by name. That interview garnered over eight million views. And when I spoke to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTUB5W6jDwM/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">actress Jameela Jamil</a> on another red carpet about how she gets called “brave” when she speaks up about social issues while other celebs stay silent, she responded, “Am I brave or are they cowards?” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> For better and for worse, people want public figures to show us their values, to tell us where they stand, and if they have to engage in the pomp and circumstance of red carpets and awards shows while the world burns, the least they can do is acknowledge the flames.  </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Call it cowardice or bravery or anything in between, but what celebrities choose to say — or don’t — about the state of the world is always a hot topic. So, what do we <em>really</em> want to hear from artists in times of crisis? As <a href=""https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/11/15/toni-morrison-art-despair/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Toni Morrison famously said</a>, “This is precisely the time when artists go to work.” It may be too simple to say that every single celebrity should be performing their activism on social media or during awards speeches. A social post is the bare minimum. And many of these artists do not have the range to engage in a productive political debate. There are many different ways to support causes you care about, and if you have money, funding movements, giving to organizers on the ground, or to victims’ families can be more powerful than simply posting an Instagram story. I don’t think it’s a useful pastime to litigate what each celeb has or hasn’t said on their personal social media accounts. But two things can be true. And we live in a time when celebrities wield more power and access than ever, with legions of stans ready to act on command. We know that when famous artists do speak up, it works. </p>



<p>Taylor Swift <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2023/09/22/1201183160/taylor-swift-instagram-voter-registration"">increased voter registration by 23 per cent</a> (the number of 18-year-olds registered more than doubled) in 2023 with a non-partisan plea for her followers to vote. Swift is an example of someone who, despite making a documentary that was heavily about her decision to start <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2020/01/24/taylor-swift-politics-miss-americana-donald-trump"">speaking out against Donald Trump</a>, has chosen to remain neutral in a time that demands partiality. Telling fans to vote without making it clear that their basic rights and freedoms are on the line is like inviting people to dinner without telling them the menu is a choice between hot dogs and razor blades. One option ain’t great; the other will kill you. But most artists try to toe the line. On one hand, Beyoncé will deliver an album (and a <a href=""https://www.vice.com/en/article/a-black-panther-halftime-the-revolutionary-politics-behind-beyonces-super-bowl-performance/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Super Bowl halftime performance</a>) that can be interpreted as a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/04/11698236/beyonce-cowboy-carter-album-country-music-history-reaction"">searing critique of America</a> while highlighting oft-forgotten Black history and on the other, she’ll be spotted <a href=""https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/a/jadegomez510/beyonce-ivanka-jared-charity-dinner"">partying with members of an administration</a> hell bent on erasing that very history. In 2026, there are only a handful of celebrities who seem to be truly channeling the spirit of Simone. The rest opt into conversations about social justice when it’s comfortable, convenient, and popular. </p>



<p>The Grammys were proof of this. From the vague (Shaboozey) to the sincere (Olivia Dean and SZA) to the specific (Bad Bunny, Billie Eilish, and Kehlani), the show ended up being an unintentional showcase of the typical range of celebrity responses to social injustice. To be clear, I think it’s important and necessary that each of these artists chose to use their speeches to stand up for immigrants and stand against ICE. But if you are going to speak up, as <a href=""https://www.vulture.com/article/2026-grammys-review-politics.html"">Craig Jenkins put it for Vulture</a>, we’re going to need more “naming and shaming.” Jenkins wrote, “The ingredients for a broadcast that could brashly outline the regime connections in the building were in play, but any elephant in the room that was tacitly acknowledged was also rarely explicitly named and shamed.”</p>

<p>Take Shaboozey for example. “Immigrants built this country, literally. So this is for them,” the singer said as he accepted the Grammy for Best Country Group/Duo Performance. “For all children of immigrants, this is also for those who came to this country in search of better opportunities, to be part of a nation that promised freedom for all and equal opportunity to everyone willing to work for it.” It’s a nice sentiment, but Shaboozey didn’t say “ICE” once in his speech and his “immigrants built this country” line not only erases the labor of enslaved Black Americans, it also plays into the harmful idea that immigrants deserve to be treated fairly solely because of their labor, instead of the fact that they are human beings. <a href=""https://people.com/shaboozey-addresses-backlash-immigrants-built-this-country-remark-grammys-speech-11899304"">Shaboozey has since apologized</a> and clarified his statements. I’m sure that the risk of receiving backlash for clumsy comments is why many stars refuse to say anything at all, but the stakes are too high to be scared of some silly social media fallout. Plus, the potential repercussions — like losing followers or brand deals — are trivial concerns compared to the violence people are facing at the hands of ICE, and in the wake of the Trump administration’s tyranny.</p>



<p>Someone who seems to understand this is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-super-bowl-halftime-show-reclaims-reimagines-america"">Bad Bunny</a>, and his career hasn’t suffered. Bad Bunny is also one of the few artists topping the charts in 2026 who actually incorporates his beliefs into his music — and he has for years. Bad Bunny speaks to the colonial violence America has enacted globally, and refuses to conform to the white supremacist ideals it continues to perpetuate. In a recent piece for NPR called “<a href=""https://www.npr.org/2026/02/05/nx-s1-5701460/where-are-the-protest-songs"">Where Are All The Protest Songs?</a>, Ann Powers writes, “Bad Bunny stands out in 2026 not only for his historic success as the first artist win album of the year for a Spanish-language album, but because DtMF does <a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/bad-bunny-debi-tirar-mas-fotos-political-lines-explained"">explicitly enact resistance</a> in songs like “LO QUE LE PASÓ A HAWAii,” calling out American imperialism, gentrification and the displacement of his fellow Puerto Ricans.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>It’s [Bad Bunny’s] clear-eyed consistency that should be the standard and the blueprint for artists who wish to put their actions and words behind their values.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In fact, Bad Bunny’s success hasn’t been hindered by his outspokenness, I think it’s added to it. Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio is unapologetically himself, a proud Puerto Rican, and someone who believes in the power of art to be political <em>and</em> personal. “Before I say thanks to God,” Bad Bunny said in his acceptance speech for Best Música Urbana Album, “I’m gonna say ICE out… We’re not savages, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans.” And when he won Album of the Year, Bad Bunny accepted in Spanish and dedicated his award to Puerto Rico. At the <a href=""https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-latin/bad-bunny-super-bowl-meaning-1235513218/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Super Bowl, Bad Bunny</a> displayed a sign that read, “The only thing more powerful than hate is love” and during “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TCX_Aqzoo4"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">El Apagón</a>,” a song which mentions the <a href=""https://www.providencejournal.com/story/entertainment/music/2022/09/19/bad-bunny-el-apagon-music-video-puerto-rico-hurricane-gentrification/10426694002/"">power grid issues Puerto Rico</a> has struggled with since Hurricane Maria (due in large part to the inaction of the U.S. government), the set featured Bad Bunny and dancers hanging from utility poles. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUhQmVDDZ0Z/?img_index=1&amp;igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="">Bad Bunny also listed countries</a> across Latin America, the Caribbean, and North America in his Super Bowl set, speaking to our diasporic connection and bookended his performance with holding up a football with the words, “<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUhQmVDDZ0Z/?img_index=1&amp;igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="">Together, We Are America</a>” scrawled on it, pushing the message that borders are imaginary and cultures are global. It was a moment that, as a Jamaican Canadian currently living in the U.S., brought me to tears. That’s only scratching the surface of the symbolism and spirit of revolt that Bad Bunny brought to the Super Bowl. When it was time to step up and say something, he did it with authenticity, integrity, history, conviction, and clarity. It’s this clear-eyed consistency that should be the standard and the blueprint for artists who wish to put their actions and words behind their values.</p>



<p>Of course, if the ask is for celebrities to show us their values, some of them will also show us their asses. Despite being dubbed “MAGA Barbie,” Sydney Sweeney has yet to specifically denounce the actions of the party she’s associated with (Sweeney is reportedly a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/03/sydney-sweeney-jeans-ad-republican-voter-registration"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">registered Republican</a>). In a <a href=""https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a70001220/sydney-sweeney-interview-2026/"">recent interview with Cosmopolitan</a>, Sweeney said, “I’ve never been here to talk about politics. I’ve always been here to make art, so this is just not a conversation I want to be at the forefront of. And I think because of that, people want to take it even further and use me as their own pawn. But it’s somebody else assigning something to me, and I can’t control that.” Later <a href=""https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a70001220/sydney-sweeney-interview-2026/"">in the Q&amp;A</a>, Sweeny vaguely defines her beliefs as being rooted in love by saying, “I’m not a hateful person” and doubles down on the idea that art is not political. </p>



<p>“I’m not a political person. I’m in the arts. I’m not here to speak on politics. That’s not an area I’ve ever even imagined getting into. It’s not why I became who I am,” Sweeney told Cosmo. “I became an actor because I like to tell stories, but I don’t believe in hate in any form.” These statements are genuinely so stupid, I almost don’t want to give them the dignity of a rebuttal. The last time <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/08/11924722/sydney-sweeney-american-eagle-ad-controversy-republican-trump"">I wrote about Sweeney</a>, I swore it was the last time. But this notion that entertainment and politics should be segregated, that one has no bearing on the other, isn’t just a false belief held by Sweeney to justify her inability to emphatically condemn an image of herself she helped create. Since the Grammys, the sentiment has been echoed by <a href=""https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/celebrity/articles/why-don-t-stfu-mark-130425855.html"">Kevin O’Leary</a> and <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/ricky-gervais-celebrities-leave-politics-out-speeches-grammys-1236494483/"">Ricky Gervais</a>, two old white men no one should be paying attention to and yet, here we are. </p>



<p><a href=""https://ca.news.yahoo.com/kevin-oleary-slams-billie-eilish-173347556.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">O’Leary posted that Eilish</a> should “STFU [shut the f-ck up]” after she said “No one is illegal on stolen land” in her <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2UnPnOYHNM"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">speech accepting the Grammy for Song of the Year</a>. “I feel like we just need to keep fighting and speaking up and protesting, and our voices really do matter, and the people matter, and fuck ICE,” Eilish continued. Based on their recent statements, Sweeney, O’Leary, and Gervais seem to agree that the artists who spoke up at the Grammys should just “shut up and sing.” But art <em>is</em> political and it always has been. Every piece of art – a song, a movie, a TV show, an album — is created within the social context of its time. Sweeney ran an unsuccessful Oscar campaign for playing an abused lesbian boxer in <em>Christy</em>. Victims of domestic violence and members of the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk3lT_r0MYA"">LGBTQ community</a> are two vulnerable groups whose <a href=""https://time.com/7332225/domestic-violence-victims-shelter-trump-immigration/"">legal protections have been under attack</a> since Trump was elected again. </p>



<p>And while art has been used by governments to weaponize, propagandize, and manipulate populations, it has also been suppressed and censored to shut down resistance. Art can be a joyful act of defiance and a powerful instrument of protest. When Sweeney calls herself a storyteller without acknowledging how stories can push narratives, preserve history, propel representation forward or stereotype entire demographics, she’s either being wilfully ignorant or just illiterate (literacy is another example about how art is political). And when artists use art to lure in victims or cover up their crimes (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/08/10634487/r-kelly-trial-allegations-charges"">R. Kelly</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/09/210844/bill-cosby-sentence-sexually-violent-predator-guilty"">Bill Cosby</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/03/9539191/harvey-weinstein-sentence-23-years-prison-women-justice"">Harvey Weinstein</a>, the Hollywood elite in <a href=""https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/a-list-of-powerful-men-named-in-the-epstein-files-from-elon-musk-to-former-prince-andrew"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">the Epstein files</a>, I could go on), it’s impossible to say that the two are unconnected. </p>



<p>At the Grammys, country singer<a href=""https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/music/articles/jelly-roll-allegedly-confronted-reporter-185644570.html""> Jelly Roll came under fire</a> for proclaiming that “people shouldn’t care to hear my opinion” because he’s “a dumb redneck.” This is also a common refrain from celebrities (and influencers). They claim not to be informed enough to speak on current events. If they are going to be given microphones, you’d think they’d put some thought and care into what they are going to say into it. There is a responsibility that comes with fame and feigning cluelessness isn’t a good excuse, it’s a copout. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVP_fXt51Y"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jelly Roll can speak about Jesus</a> and preach about his religion, but he refuses to interrogate the teachings in the very Bible he totes around in order to stand up for the basic human rights of his neighbors. Jelly Roll’s comments probably didn’t come as a surprise. He’s a white country star and the genre tends to lean heavily conservative. The music industry is a business, and when the majority of your fan base is Republican, artists aren’t staying silent out of ignorance, they are choosing money over morals. </p>



<p>Money is the only explanation for <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/feb/06/nicki-minaj-maga-era-barbz-defend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nicki Minaj’s recent behavior</a> — even though her fanbase is overwhelmingly queer and Black. In the past, the Trinidad-born, New York-raised rapper hailed herself as a proud immigrant standing in opposition to Donald Trump’s immigration policies. Now, she’s full MAGA. “I am probably the president’s number one fan, and that’s not going to change,” Minaj said last week at the<a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/trump-accounts-nicki-minaj.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> U.S. Treasury Department’s Trump Accounts Summit</a>. “And the hate, or what people have to say, does not affect me at all.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> My wish is for these artists to continue to speak up, not just when two white people are murdered and the country deems it socially acceptable to say something. And not just when it’s comfortable. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Along with holding hands with Trump (shudder), Minaj “thanked the president for getting her a Trump Gold Card, a kind of visa for wealthy foreigners to help them secure expedited U.S. residency,” <a href=""https://slate.com/culture/2026/02/nicki-minaj-trump-gold-card-husband-citizen-grammys-trevor-noah-don-lemon.html"">according to Slate</a>. “The visa normally requires a <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4q1lddj8go?accountMarketingPreferences=off"">$1 million contribution, plus fees</a>; Minaj… nabbed the Trump Gold Card for free.” There’s conflicting reports as to whether Minaj’s visa is legit, but it’s clear that cozying up to Trump is for her own personal gain. As digital creator and educator <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DUZnISvjqZl/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="">Raven Schwam-Curtis says in a video</a> posted to her @ravenreveals account, Minaj “has chosen to side with a president that uses the optics of Black women as ‘proof’ that his regime is doing good things for our communities while actively harming us,” she says. “Representation doesn’t equal liberation or solidarity. If anything it shows how easily representation can be weaponized by the right when your class position pulls you out of solidarity with regular Black folk.” Through her art, Minaj gained wealth, status, and standom that she has now leveraged to push her far-right agenda. And <a href=""https://www.newsweek.com/nicki-minaj-fans-barbz-vote-republican-trump-11482667"">according to Newsweek</a>, legions of Minaj’s fans, dubbed “Barbz” are following her pivot to the Republican Party. </p>



<p>It’s already problematic that we live in a time when celeb worship is at an all-time high. We shouldn’t be looking to these people to tell us what to believe, but they are influential, whether we want them to be or not. If Minaj and Bad Bunny stand at two opposite ends of the celebs speaking up politically spectrum, they each represent the <em>dos</em> and <em>don’ts</em> of celebrity political activism. One is emphasizing how culture and community can combat oppressive regimes (Benito) and the other is proof that conformity and greed can make you complicit in upholding them (Minaj).</p>



<p>The Grammys, and the Super Bowl halftime show, served as hopeful examples of celebrities meeting the moment, even though they both still exist within institutions that sustain the status quo. My wish is for these artists — and anyone with a platform — to continue to speak up, not just when two white people are murdered and the country deems it socially acceptable to say something. And not just when it’s comfortable. Like Bad Bunny and Kehlani (who has been a <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@varietymagazine/video/7508887896628219178"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pro-Palestinian advocate</a> in her music as well as on social media), my hope for all public figures to use every avenue of their influence to try to shake the table and push back against powerful people who aim to snuff out dissension and stifle diversity.</p>



<p>“We’re too powerful of a group to all be in a room at the same time and not make some kind of a statement in our country,” Kehlani <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suQNZoLVrdE"">told the Hollywood Reporter</a> on the red carpet at the Grammys. “I hope everybody’s inspired to join together as a community of artists and speak out against what’s going on, and I’mma leave this and say “‘Fuck ICE,’” she echoed during her speech. </p>



<p>I started this piece by quoting Nina Simone and as cliche as it may be, I’m going to end it the same way. Because Simone was decades before her time. And every artist (including actresses like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DURBiKkEoQZ/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kerry Washington</a>, <a href=""https://iop.harvard.edu/events/artist-public-life-sophia-bush-activism-artistry-and-courage-speak"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sophia Bush</a>, and <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hacks-star-hannah-einbinder-criticized-ice-shouted-free-palestine-emmy-rcna231320"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hannah Einbinder</a>) who dedicate their platforms to advocacy for those whose voices need to be heard, are doing so because of the path Simone, and others like her, paved. I think their legacy should be more than just memes. So, I’ll leave you with Nina Simone’s full quote: </p>



<p><em>“An artist’s duty, as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times. I think that is true of painters, sculptors, poets, musicians. As far as I’m concerned, it’s their choice, but I choose to reflect the times and situations in which I find myself. That, to me, is my duty. And at this crucial time in our lives, when everything is so desperate, when everyday is a matter of survival, I don’t think you can help but be involved. Young people, black and white, know this. That’s why they’re so involved in politics. We will shape and mold this country or it will not be molded and shaped at all anymore. So I don’t think you have a choice. How can you be an artist and NOT reflect the times? That to me is the definition of an artist.”</em></p>

<p>Cosmic beings, this week opens with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, a liminal checkpoint between what has already climaxed and what is about to be reborn. Last quarter moons are not about manifesting or initiating, they’re about editing. This one asks us to release what the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-full-snow-moon-in-leo-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Leo Full Moon</a> revealed is no longer sustainable, especially around power, control, emotional attachments, and unspoken resentments. You may encounter small speed bumps, emotional flare-ups, or moments of resistance. Instead of pushing through, pause and ask yourself: <em>What am I being asked to let go of so I don’t carry it into the eclipse?</em> Scorpio energy reminds us that release is rarely neat, but it is necessary.</p>



<p>Midweek, the emotional tone softens as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, a placement where Venus feels especially at home. Under this transit, compassion rises and defensiveness melts. With Mercury already in Pisces, conversations become more heart-centered, intuitive, and emotionally nuanced. This is a powerful week for forgiveness, creative expression, spiritual connection, and choosing love over fear, not in a bypassing way, but in a grounded, human one. As Pluto continues its work in Aquarius, reshaping collective systems and futures, Venus in Pisces reminds us that revolution without tenderness is unsustainable.</p>



<p>The emotional and spiritual weight of the week peaks on February 13th, when Saturn leaves Pisces and enters Aries, closing a chapter that began in March 2023. Cosmic beings, give yourselves credit. Saturn in Pisces asked for surrender, boundary repair, grief work, and deep spiritual accountability. Its exit may bring relief, but also unexpected emotion. This is the final full week of the Year of the Snake, and grief can surface alongside excitement.</p>



<p>Saturn in Aries begins a brand-new 29-year cycle at the very start of the zodiac, but this is <em>not </em>a race. With Mercury approaching its retrograde shadow and eclipse season arriving next week, this remains an in-between time. The momentum is real, but so is the need for gentleness. Trust that the tides are turning. You’re allowed to move forward slowly, intentionally, and with love for both yourself and the collective you’re helping to shape.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, this week begins with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, activating your sector of intimacy, shared resources, emotional debts, and energetic entanglements. For you, this is a clearing moment. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-diary"">Something tied to money</a>, power dynamics, trust, or emotional obligation is ready to be released. You may realize you’ve been carrying responsibility that isn’t actually yours, or holding on out of loyalty rather than alignment. The discomfort here is real, but so is the relief. This is about lightening your load before the eclipse ahead, not pushing through out of pride.</p>



<p>On February 10th, Venus enters Pisces, joining Mercury in your spirituality, rest, and closure sector. This is a softer, quieter shift that asks you to slow your pace emotionally, even if your external life feels busy. You may feel more reflective, nostalgic, or open-hearted than usual. Old feelings, dreams, or memories can resurface, not to distract you, but to be integrated. This is a beautiful time for forgiveness, creative flow, and releasing what you no longer need to carry into your next chapter. You don’t have to fix everything this week. Some things resolve through compassion, not effort.</p>



<p>The major moment arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters your sign, beginning a brand-new 29-year cycle for Saturn and a defining chapter for you. Having Saturn in your sign is not always easy. It brings accountability, responsibility, and a mirror that asks you to take yourself seriously. You may feel more visible, more scrutinized, or more aware of the weight of your choices. But here’s the balance: Neptune is also in your sign, softening Saturn’s edges with vision, faith, and imagination. This combination asks you to build your dreams in real time. The spotlight is on you now, yes, but this is not about perfection. It’s about integrity. With great power comes great responsibility, and this week reminds you that you’re more than capable of rising to both.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, are you ready for a more social, emotionally open week than you’re used to? The energy shifts fast, starting with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, which activates your partnership and one-on-one relationship sector. This is a release point around dynamics that feel intense, imbalanced, or emotionally draining. A pattern in a close relationship may become impossible to ignore, not to provoke drama, but to help <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/casual-relationship-rules-boundaries"">you reset boundaries</a>. The invitation is to let go of power struggles and choose honesty over control. What you release now creates space for healthier connections moving forward. Midweek, the tone softens as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in your friendship, community, and technology sector. This is a beautiful shift for you.</p>



<p>Conversations feel warmer, connections more compassionate, and social interactions less transactional. You may feel drawn to collaborate, reconnect with friends, or show up more authentically online. Creativity flows more easily when you’re surrounded by people who genuinely support you. Just be mindful of over-giving… Pisces energy loves to merge, but your energy is still precious.</p>



<p>The biggest shift of the week arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating your spirituality, healing, and subconscious sector. This begins a longer chapter of inner work, emotional accountability, and spiritual discipline. You may feel called to take your mental health, rest, or healing practices more seriously. While Saturn here can feel heavy at times, remember that Neptune is also in Aries, softening the experience by reminding you that healing doesn’t have to be harsh. This is about building trust with yourself, honoring your intuition, and releasing old fears gently rather than forcefully.</p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, are you ready to clean up your schedule and your energy at the same time? The week begins with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, activating your work, routines, and well-being sector. This is a checkpoint moment where something about your daily life clearly isn’t working anymore. You may notice burnout creeping in, ineffciencies piling up, or commitments that drain more than they give. Instead of pushing harder, this moon asks you to subtract. Let go of habits, tasks, or expectations that don’t actually support your health or focus.</p>



<p>On February 10th, the vibe shifts as Venus enters Pisces, joining Mercury in your career and public image sector. Suddenly, conversations at work feel softer, more emotionally intelligent, and less transactional. This is a great week to lead with empathy, creativity, and intuition rather than trying to logic your way through everything. You may feel more visible professionally or inspired to align your work with something meaningful. Just watch the tendency to overpromise. Pisces energy is generous, but clarity still matters.</p>



<p>The biggest internal shift comes on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating your friendship, community, and long-term goals sector. This begins a period where you’re asked to take your dreams and social connections more seriously. Saturn here can feel like a reality check around who you’re building with and which visions are actually sustainable. Neptune’s presence in Aries softens the edges, reminding you that purpose and imagination can coexist. This is about committing to goals and communities that feel aligned, not just exciting.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955474.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cancer, are you ready to get honest about what actually brings you joy versus what just looks good on the surface? The week opens with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, activating your creativity, pleasure, and self-expression sector. This is a release point around old patterns in romance, fun, or creative pursuits that no longer feel nourishing. You may realize that certain ways of seeking validation or distraction aren’t giving you the fulfillment you crave. Letting go here creates space for joy that feels more genuine and less performative.</p>



<p>Midweek, the energy lifts as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in your expansion, travel, and belief sector. This is a beautiful alignment for you, bringing emotional ease, inspiration, and a renewed sense of faith. You may feel called to learn something new, plan a trip, or reconnect with a spiritual practice that grounds you. Conversations feel more hopeful and heart-centered. This is a reminder that growth doesn’t have to be stressful. It can feel gentle and meaningful at the same time.</p>



<p>The most important shift arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating your career and public life sector. This begins a longer chapter of professional accountability and leadership. You may feel more visible, more responsible, or more aware of expectations placed on you. While Saturn here can feel heavy, remember that Neptune is also in Aries, adding vision, creativity, and compassion to your path. You’re learning how to lead with emotional intelligence. This is not about hardening yourself. It’s about building something meaningful without losing your heart.</p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, are you ready to soften without feeling like you’re giving up your power? The week begins with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, moving through the part of your life connected to home, emotional roots, and private foundations. This is a release moment around family dynamics, living situations, or emotional patterns that have been quietly influencing your decisions. You may feel called to let go of an old story about where you come from or what safety is supposed to look like. It’s not about cutting ties dramatically, it’s about loosening emotional grips that keep you from feeling fully free.</p>



<p>Midweek, the energy deepens as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the realm of intimacy, shared resources, and emotional merging. Conversations may turn more vulnerable, and you might feel more open to trust, heal, or share parts of yourself you usually keep guarded. This is a powerful time for emotional honesty, but also for discernment. Compassion doesn’t mean overextending yourself. Let closeness feel mutual, not draining.</p>



<p>The major shift arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating the area of your life tied to growth, wisdom, and long-term vision. This begins a chapter where your beliefs are tested and refined. Saturn asks you to commit to a philosophy, a path, or a purpose that actually aligns with who you’re becoming. With Neptune also in Aries, imagination and faith soften the weight of responsibility. You’re learning that leadership isn’t just about confidence, it’s about integrity. This week reminds you that expanding your world requires both courage and care.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Virgo, are you ready to stop explaining yourself and start trusting what you already know? The week opens with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, moving through the part of your life connected to communication, thought patterns, and daily exchanges. This is a release moment around how you speak to yourself and others. You may notice mental habits, assumptions, or conversations that feel draining or unnecessary. The invitation is to let go of overthinking and choose clarity over control. Not every thought deserves your attention.</p>



<p>Midweek brings a relational softening as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the zone of partnerships, collaboration, and one-on-one dynamics. This is a heart-opening influence that encourages empathy, compassion, and emotional presence in your closest connections. Conversations may feel more tender or vulnerable, and you may crave emotional attunement over logic. This is beautiful territory for healing, but remember to keep your boundaries intact. Connection doesn’t require self-erasure.</p>



<p>The biggest shift of the week arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating the area of your life tied to intimacy, shared resources, and emotional responsibility. This begins a longer chapter of restructuring how you give, receive, and trust. Saturn asks for honesty and accountability, while Neptune in Aries adds sensitivity and spiritual depth. You’re learning that vulnerability can be intentional, not overwhelming. This week helps you build deeper connections without carrying more than is yours.</p>

<h2>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Libra, are you ready to get clear about what you truly value, not just what keeps the peace? The week opens with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, moving through the area of your life connected to money, self-worth, and personal resources. This is a release point around financial habits, energetic exchanges, or beliefs about what you deserve. You may realize that something you’ve been tolerating out of comfort or fear is no longer aligned. Letting go here creates space for more intentional stability.</p>



<p>Midweek, the tone softens as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the part of your life tied to daily routines, work rhythms, and well-being. This is an invitation to bring more compassion into how you treat yourself day to day. You may feel drawn to slow down, care for your body, or approach work with more heart and less pressure. Productivity looks different under Pisces energy. It’s about flow, not force.</p>



<p>The major shift arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating your relationship and partnership realm.

Neptune’s presence in Aries softens this process, reminding you that love doesn’t have to be rigid to be real. This week sets the tone for more mature, intentional connections moving forward.</p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, are you ready to release the version of yourself that’s been holding it all together a little <em>too </em>tightly? The week begins with the Last Quarter Moon in your sign, moving through the core of your identity, body, and emotional truth. This is a powerful shedding moment. You may feel more sensitive, introspective, or aware of patterns you’ve outgrown. Something about how you show up in the world is ready to change, not through force, but through honesty. Let go of the need to control the narrative. What’s real will remain.</p>



<p>Midweek, the energy softens as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the area of your life tied to creativity, romance, pleasure, and self-expression. This is a beautiful counterbalance to the intensity you’re feeling. Inspiration flows more easily, and emotional connections feel sweeter and less guarded. You may feel drawn to art, intimacy, or moments of joy that don’t require explanation. Let yourself enjoy this. Healing doesn’t always come from doing the work… sometimes it comes from remembering how to play.</p>



<p>The biggest shift of the week arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating the realm of your life connected to work, health, and daily responsibilities. This begins a longer chapter of learning how to structure your life in a way that actually supports your energy. Saturn asks for discipline and accountability, while Neptune in Aries adds sensitivity and intuition. You’re learning how to work smarter, not harder, and how to honor your limits without guilt. This week reminds you that power doesn’t come from endurance alone, it comes from sustainability.</p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, are you ready to slow down just enough to actually hear <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-intuition-gut-instinct-personal-safety"">what your intuition</a> has been trying to tell you? The week opens with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, moving through the part of your life tied to rest, closure, and subconscious patterns. This is a behind-the-scenes release moment. You may feel more tired, reflective, or emotionally porous than usual, and that’s not a weakness. It’s information. Let go of habits, expectations, or internal pressure that keep you running on autopilot. This is a reset, not a setback.</p>



<p>Midweek brings a softer, more nurturing tone as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the area of your life connected to home, family, and emotional grounding. You may crave comfort, familiarity, or deeper emotional safety. Conversations with loved ones can feel more tender and healing, and you may feel inspired to make your space feel more like a sanctuary. Just be mindful of nostalgia pulling you backward instead of helping you integrate. Comfort is meant to restore you, not stall you.</p>



<p>The biggest shift arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating the realm of creativity, joy, romance, and self-expression. This begins a longer chapter of taking what lights you up more seriously. Saturn asks you to commit to your passions, not just chase excitement. Neptune’s presence in Aries keeps the magic alive, reminding you that discipline doesn’t have to kill the fun. This week sets the tone for building a life that feels inspired <em>and </em>sustainable.</p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, are you noticing how your definition of success is quietly changing? The week begins with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, moving through the part of your life connected to friendships, community ties, and long-term aspirations. This is a release moment around social dynamics or goals that no longer feel aligned with who you’re becoming. You may realize that certain group spaces, collaborations, or dreams need updating. Letting go here isn’t a failure, it’s refinement. You’re making room for more meaningful connections and intentions.</p>



<p>Midweek, the energy softens as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the realm of communication, learning, and everyday exchanges. Conversations feel more heartfelt and less transactional, and you may find yourself speaking from intuition rather than strategy. This is a supportive time for writing, teaching, or reconnecting with people you haven’t spoken to in a while. Just be mindful of mixed signals. Clarity still matters, even when compassion leads.</p>



<p>The major shift arrives on February 13th, when Saturn, your ruling planet, re-enters Aries, activating the area of your life tied to home, family, and emotional foundations. After years of Saturn pushing you to grow through responsibility and public-facing pressure, this marks a turn inward. You may feel called to restructure your private life, redefine stability, or take emotional boundaries more seriously. With Neptune also in Aries, this process is softened by imagination and sensitivity. You’re learning that true authority comes from being grounded internally, not just accomplished externally.</p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, are you ready to get honest about what kind of future you actually want to build, not just talk about? The week begins with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, activating the part of your life connected to career, reputation, and long-term direction. This is a release moment around professional expectations, public roles, or ambitions that no longer reflect who you are becoming. You may feel tension between where you’ve been visible and where you actually want to invest your energy. Letting go here isn’t dramatic, it’s strategic. You’re clearing space before a major reset.</p>



<p>Midweek brings a shift in tone as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the realm of money, values, and self-worth. This softens your relationship with security and abundance, encouraging you to lead with intuition rather than anxiety. You may feel more compassionate toward yourself around finances or more open to receiving support. Creative or spiritually aligned income ideas can surface now. Just stay mindful of boundaries. Generosity is beautiful, but it shouldn’t come at the expense of stability.</p>



<p>The biggest shift of the week arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating your communication, mindset, and learning zone. This begins a longer chapter of taking your ideas seriously and committing to your voice. Saturn asks for discipline and follow-through, while Neptune in Aries keeps imagination alive. You’re learning how to turn insight into impact. This week sets the tone for speaking with clarity, intention, and responsibility, knowing that what you say and how you say it carries more weight than before.</p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, are you ready to honor how far you’ve come instead of focusing on how much more there is to do? The week opens with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, moving through the area of your life tied to growth, faith, and perspective. This is a release moment around outdated beliefs, limiting narratives, or paths you once thought you <em>had </em>to follow. You may feel called to let go of a version of the future that no longer resonates. Trust that releasing an old vision makes room for something more aligned to take shape.</p>



<p>Midweek brings a beautiful homecoming as Venus enters your sign on February 10th, joining Mercury already there. This softens everything. You’re more magnetic, intuitive, and emotionally open, and others are more receptive to your presence. This is a time for connection, creativity, self-care, and gentle honesty. Just be mindful of over-giving or absorbing other people’s emotions. Compassion is your gift, but boundaries are your anchor.</p>



<p>The biggest energetic shift arrives on February 13th, when Saturn leaves your sign and enters Aries, ending a demanding chapter that began in 2023. This week, you may feel both relief and reflection. Saturn in Aries activates your relationship with money, values, and self-worth, beginning a new phase of building stability from a more empowered place. With Neptune also in Aries, dreaming and doing begin to work together. This week reminds you that softness and strength are not opposites. You’re learning how to build a life that supports both.</p>
