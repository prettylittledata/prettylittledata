<p>Jinwan Aviation New City, one of Zhuhai's fastest-growing areas, urgently needed a new community center to meet the demands of its expanding population. The site, located in the heart of this new district, consisted of four standalone ancillary buildings surrounded by dense housing developments. However, due to rushed planning, these buildings suffered from design flaws: closed facades, disconnected circulation, and a lack of functional synergy. The client's initial plan was to renovate the facades and assign each building a distinct function—offices, community activities, or retail—to serve as ancillary facilities supporting daily community life. However, with budget severely limited, a conventional renovation approach would only deliver piecemeal improvements. A new strategy was required. During on-site investigations, the architects recognized that the key to creating a true community hub lay not in simply upgrading the facades, but in reimagining the spirit of place. At the heart of this vision was a long-overlooked gem—the adjacent municipal green park.</p>",

<p>Moncler's new headquarters, a landmark of urban regeneration. ACPV ARCHITECTS Antonio Citterio Patricia Viel presents Casa Moncler, the new headquarters of the brand, located within the Symbiosis District in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/milan"">Milan</a>, a strategic area of urban regeneration in the southern quadrant of the city. The project takes the form of a complex spanning 77,000 square meters, distributed across six above-ground floors and two basement levels, reaching a total height of approximately 32 meters. Designed to accommodate over 700 employees, the building offers highly flexible workspaces and advanced environmental performance, establishing a dialogue with the site's historical legacy. The new headquarters for Moncler reinterprets contemporary industrial architecture by evoking the morphology and materiality of the site's original manufacturing context, transforming these references into an architectural language that is both essential and sophisticated. The main building stands out for its rigorous compositional layout and its restrained formal presence. The volumetric articulation also includes a semi-underground showroom, whose architecture features a shed roof that establishes a dialogue with the surrounding structures. This element intersects volumetrically with the main body, creating an architectural junction that defines the perimeter of the campus and reinforces its overall compositional coherence. Embracing the principles of the Building-as-a-City, the structure absorbs the complexity of an urban environment, becoming an organism capable of accommodating a wide range of functions and services, while fostering exchange and cross-contamination among different architectural typologies. Moreover, elements of industrial archaeology, such as the historic chimney, have been repurposed and integrated into the new design, reinforcing the connection between past and present and anchoring the building within Milan's urban landscape.</p>",

<figure><img alt=""The image displays the word ‘Typography’ in a serif font with labeled parts of letter anatomy. Green lines and labels point to specific elements including: cap height, baseline, stem, descender, bowl, counter, link, bracket, terminal, ascender, x-height, ear, uppercase and lowercase characters, and point size. The visual explains the structure and proportions of type, showing how each typographic term relates to the form of individual letters."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Mxg0yTFYMkkSvmKUcjFcUw.png"" /></figure><h3>Typography basics</h3><h4><strong>A practical introduction to typography — from anatomy and spacing to legibility and alignment — for designers who want to create type that reads beautifully and feels intentional.</strong></h4><p>Typography isn’t just about picking a pretty font. It’s the craft of shaping written language into a visual experience — how words look, breathe, and interact on a page or screen. Good typography quietly guides the reader, while poor typography shouts for attention in all the wrong ways. Every detail — from letter spacing to line height — affects how users read, feel, and engage. Let’s unpack the essentials.</p><p>Every letter has a structure, and understanding it helps you design with precision. Terms like <em>ascender</em>, <em>descender</em>, <em>baseline</em>, and <em>x-height</em> describe the invisible skeleton that keeps type coherent. The x-height, for instance, determines how big a typeface feels even at the same point size.</p><p>Serif and sans-serif typefaces differ in tone partly because of these structures: serifs guide the eye along lines of text, while sans-serifs often feel cleaner and more modern. Knowing anatomy allows you to mix typefaces consciously rather than by vibe alone.</p><h3>Typographic Anatomy</h3><figure><img alt=""A large black uppercase ‘X’ is shown with orange dashed lines illustrating its body width and x-height. The baseline and measurement labels mark the height and width of the character, explaining fundamental proportions of type."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*0aiFcVswjKru5KVc.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Lowercase letters ‘p’ and ‘d’ are displayed with orange dashed lines showing ascender and descender zones.

The ’N’ marks its serif, the ‘B’ highlights its bowl, and the ‘E’ identifies the arm and stem, with orange accents emphasizing each feature."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*oF2wPhhxGqeyvnoI.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Image 4 — Parts and shapes of type: Ear, Spine, and ShoulderLowercase ‘g’, ‘S’, and ‘m’ illustrate three distinct components of type. The ear of the ‘g’, the curved spine of the ‘S’, and the shoulder of the ‘m’ are all highlighted in orange."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*VnIXaIKRX2F4UltN.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Letters ‘A’, ‘f’, and ‘e’ are displayed to show horizontal structural features.

The left side shows geometric single-story forms, while the right side shows traditional double-story shapes used in many serif typefaces."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*6rCySVJcme6QkNQ0.png"" /></figure><h3>Kerning, tracking, leading</h3><p>These three terms define the rhythm and flow of text. <em>Kerning</em> adjusts the space between individual letters, <em>tracking</em> controls spacing across whole words or paragraphs, and <em>leading</em> (pronounced “ledding”) sets the space between lines.</p><p>Think of them as the breathing room of type. Too tight, and words feel suffocating; too loose, and they drift apart like strangers at a party. Consistent, intentional spacing is one of the clearest markers of professional typography — and one of the easiest to overlook.</p><figure><img alt=""Image 1 — Kerning: Distance between lettersThe heading ‘Kerning’ appears above the phrase ‘Distance between letters.’ Two examples of the lowercase word ‘hi’ are displayed: one with normal spacing and one with increased space between the letters. A double-headed arrow labeled ‘In Figma, they call it “Letter spacing”’ illustrates the spacing difference."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*exdHrDfswchfkbUW.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Tracking’ is followed by the description ‘an overall adjustment of space applied equally to a word, a line, or a passage of text.’ Two blocks of lorem ipsum text show the difference between normal tracking and wide tracking.

An arrow labeled ‘In Figma, they call it “Line Height”’ connects the two examples."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*1SA6s7oIc-lxMu71.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Widow’ appears with the description ‘a word hanging out at the end of a paragraph.’ Two side-by-side text blocks show examples: the left one has a single word (‘ultrices’) isolated at the end, marked with an orange oval and a label ‘widow,’ while the right one shows the corrected version. A red cross and green checkmark highlight incorrect and correct formatting."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*vxfPSLbCG52lX1Uj.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Orphan’ appears with the description ‘a word or part of a word at the top of a column.’ Two text columns are displayed. The left column contains a paragraph ending mid-column, and the right column begins with an isolated short word (‘id.’) marked with an orange circle and a label ‘orphan,’ demonstrating improper text flow."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*rJOBFClNu8ioQXFr.png"" /></figure><h3>Type alignment</h3><p>Left, right, center, or justified — each alignment changes how the reader experiences text. Left-aligned text feels natural for most Western readers; it mirrors how our eyes expect to move. Centered text adds elegance in small doses, like headings or invitations, but strains readability in long paragraphs.</p><p>Justified text can look neat but often introduces awkward gaps between words. There’s no one right choice — only what fits the tone and purpose of the content.</p><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Flush left, rag right’ introduces a layout example where text is aligned to the left margin and uneven on the right. The left block of lorem ipsum text is labeled ‘flush left’ with an orange arrow pointing downward and a note saying ‘rag right.’ On the right, a warning icon appears beside text explaining that this style is preferred in Western countries because people read from left to right."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*dOSLzL-Wlw7S3k0r.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Flush right, rag left’ introduces a layout where text is aligned to the right and uneven on the left. The lorem ipsum text is labeled ‘rag right’ with an orange outline marking the uneven edge and an arrow labeled ‘flush left’ at the bottom. On the right, a warning icon and note indicate that flush-right text is not ideal for long passages because the eye struggles to find the next line."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*aWYF12QNYPjUAxRV.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Justified’ is followed by an example paragraph where all text lines are aligned evenly on both sides. An orange arrow and curly brackets highlight uniform alignment and mention that ‘all lines are the same length and the margins are even.’ To the right, text reads ‘Sometimes, justified texts create rivers of space. That is not good,’ warning against uneven gaps that can occur."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*G7iQYhBI0QcuBuM6.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Centered’ introduces text aligned along the center axis. A block of lorem ipsum text is centered on the left, while on the right, a yellow warning triangle with text explains that centered text is not suitable for long reading because the eye loses its place easily."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*F2Bb_YwA_2YglpBY.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Random / Asymmetrical / Mixed’ shows multiple short lines of lorem ipsum text arranged irregularly, without consistent alignment. On the right, a yellow warning icon and note state, ‘Visually exciting but not good for lengthy reading,’ emphasizing that inconsistent alignment may attract attention but reduce readability."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*kXehgriPbRKHc8Nq.png"" /></figure><h3>Indents, outdents, and hanging punctuations</h3><p>Indenting the first line of a paragraph subtly signals a new thought, while outdents (negative indents) can highlight lists or quotes. Hanging punctuation, where quotation marks or bullets sit outside the text block, preserves clean visual alignment.</p><p>These are the small design manners that readers might never notice — but would feel their absence. They lend rhythm and grace to long-form content.</p><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Indent’ appears above a paragraph of lorem ipsum text on the left, where the first line begins slightly inward to demonstrate indentation. An orange arrow highlights the starting position. On the right, a screenshot labeled ‘HOW TO’ shows a Figma settings panel with ‘Paragraph Indent: 25’ under ‘Type Details,’ illustrating where indentation can be adjusted."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*e9r5Yx3qlJZDgP0k.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Outdent’ introduces an example with multiple lorem ipsum paragraphs. Each line begins with an orange arrow pointing left, showing that the first line extends outside the normal text margin. On the right, a yellow warning triangle is accompanied by text that reads, ‘Unsure if a setting in Figma can do this. It is not commonly used in layouts,’ noting that outdents are rare."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*DX14YOE29B7Y3rsR.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Hanging punctuation’ is shown above justified lorem ipsum text with punctuation marks slightly extending beyond the right margin. Orange arrows and lines highlight the overhanging characters, with text that reads, ‘Extend beyond the edge of the justified text.’ Below, a yellow warning icon explains that this maintains the optical alignment of the column, and smaller text lists examples like quotes, apostrophes, hyphens, commas, and periods."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*X8YreWiBAJDQX5o3.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Hanging punctuation’ appears again, with a paragraph of justified text where punctuation is kept within the alignment boundary. Orange arrows indicate no extension beyond the edge, with a note saying, ‘No need to extend beyond the edge of the justified text.’ A warning icon below clarifies that larger punctuation marks such as question marks, colons, and parentheses should remain aligned."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*-lrNE26bhFlujCrc.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The left section labeled ‘Prime marks’ displays the contraction ‘I’m’ using incorrect straight marks, with a circled area highlighting the prime mark above the ‘I.’ Below it, an example reads ‘His height is 5’-9&quot;.’ The right section labeled ‘Apostrophe’ shows the correct curved apostrophe in ‘I’m,’ highlighted by a circle, with an example sentence below: ‘He said, “I am a designer.”’"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*GFA93aD7_v8U2roR.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Letters &amp; strokes’ presents two large letter ‘Q’ examples. On the left, a thick-stroked orange ‘Q’ is outlined in black, with a warning icon stating, ‘Letter forms are distorted with very thick stroke. Refrain from doing this.’ On the right, a thinner orange ‘Q’ shows proper stroke weight with a note saying, ‘A thinner stroke is ok.’"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*AuUeVrJ49gfrPrpK.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Stacking type? No!’ introduces an example with vertically arranged words. On the left, uppercase ‘HELLO’ is stacked vertically, and on the right, lowercase ‘hello’ is also stacked. A warning icon and note beside them state, ‘Irregular width of these letters creates a rough edge on both sides of the type,’ illustrating why stacked type reduces readability."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*We6L8G_yOVVw788g.png"" /></figure><h3>Legibility and readability</h3><p>They sound similar but mean different things. <em>Legibility</em> is about how clearly letters can be distinguished — a function of font design, size, and contrast. <em>Readability</em> is about how easy it feels to read longer passages — affected by line length, spacing, and even the surrounding design.</p><p>A beautifully legible font can still be unreadable in practice if the text is too dense or too wide. The goal isn’t just to be seen but to be comfortably followed.</p><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Legibility and readability definition’ appears at the top. Below it, two sentences define the terms: ‘Legibility measures whether the viewer can read the text’ and ‘Readability measures how much the reader wants to read the text,’ with the words can and wants underlined for emphasis."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*y0p20rb87C0p_SW5.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Legibility and readability’ introduces two columns comparing fonts. On the left, text labeled ‘Sans Serif’ is written in a clean sans serif typeface. On the right, text labeled ‘Serif’ uses a serif typeface. A yellow warning icon at the bottom notes: ‘Research has shown that serif is slightly easier to read because of the horizontal serifs which lead the eye forward.’"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*iowm_On0u8Mrlq9q.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Legibility and readability’ appears again. Two columns compare ‘Sans Serif’ and ‘Serif’ text using similar words: ‘infinite, millenium, minimum, lilies.’ A yellow warning icon and note below explain: ‘Serifs provide details which help the eye differentiate between similar letters.’"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*nfl-M75tAoegS8ru.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘How many characters in a line’ appears above a sample paragraph. A numbered scale runs above the text, showing marks at 1, 52, and 70, with the label ‘optimal characters per line’ in orange. A yellow warning icon at the bottom reads, ’28 picas wide * 2.5 = 70 characters,’ indicating an ideal line length for readability."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*n3ZwY3GzZZa8BQjQ.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Text size’ with the subheading ‘generally range between 8–10, sometimes 12 point’ appears at the top.

In UI design, type must perform at small sizes and varying screens. In print, it must hold character at high resolutions and long durations.</p><p>Display type can afford drama; body text should feel invisible. Understanding how context shapes your typographic decisions is what separates art from noise.</p><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Lining numbers’ with subtitle ‘some fonts have numbers that are all the same height’ appears above two rows of numerals from 1 to 0.

Once you see how subtle its impact is, you start noticing type everywhere: on screens, in streets, on receipts. Every font choice tells a story. The more fluently you speak the language of type, the more precisely you can design experiences that speak back.</p><p>Typography has a strange power: it’s both invisible and unforgettable. The best type never demands your attention, yet it defines how every word feels. A letter’s curve can suggest warmth or precision, while spacing can create calm or urgency. This is why typography sits at the heart of design — connecting language with emotion.</p><p>So when we adjust a line height or choose between Helvetica and Garamond, we’re not just picking styles; we’re shaping how people interpret meaning. Typography is the quiet storyteller behind every interface, poster, and page.

<h4>Apps SDK, design principles, and the future of contextual UX.</h4><figure><img alt=""Visual showing app integrations inside ChatGPT — icons for Zillow, Booking.com, and Canva appear as selectable buttons next to the text “in ChatGPT,” representing how external apps can now be accessed directly within conversations."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*d8jKD1pjcy5Y2aHhxAL70w.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Current ChatGPT app integrations like Zillow, Booking.com, and Canva, illustrating seamless in-chat access.<br /> <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/""><em>OpenAI — Introducing Apps in ChatGPT</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Do you remember how Tony Stark talked to JARVIS in <em>Iron Man</em>?</p><p>He simply said what he wanted to do, and JARVIS got it done. There was no need to open menus, switch applications, or decide which interface to use next. Every option that could have slowed him down was already resolved for him, so his attention stayed on the task itself.</p><figure><img alt=""A still from Iron Man 2 showing J.A.R.V.I.S.

In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNY2HVBIZ6I"">Brad Lightcap’s recent interview with Bloomberg</a>, he shared a vision where third-party apps could work together seamlessly inside ChatGPT. Users would never have to leave a conversation to get something done.</p><blockquote>“It’s the contextual aspect of ‘I’m doing X’ or ‘I need Y’ — I’m on a road trip and I want to know what playlist would go well with this… — that allows you to use ChatGPT to solve higher-level tasks and integrate apps contextually,” <em>said </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNY2HVBIZ6I""><em>Brad Lightcap in a Bloomberg interview.</em></a></blockquote><p>For designers, the real challenge lies in understanding what this shift implies. When conversations become the new interface and tools can appear contextually, how should we design the flow, timing, and handoff between chat and visual elements?</p><h3>Evolution from plugins, MCP, to SDK</h3><p>To understand what this shift truly means for design, we first need to look at how the system evolved.</p><p>In the early days of plugins, tools lived in separate spaces. Users had to switch between apps, browser extensions, or new tabs to complete even the simplest task.</p><p>Then came the Model Context Protocol, or MCP. It created a standard way for ChatGPT to talk with external tools and data sources. MCP allowed the model to call a tool and pass structured information through a single, consistent channel. It was an invisible bridge between the model and the outside world.</p><p>Building on that foundation, OpenAI introduced the <strong>Apps Software Development Kit (SDK),</strong> a toolkit that makes this bridge visible and interactive. It determines <em>when</em> a tool appears, <em>how</em> it looks, and <em>how</em> people can interact with it directly inside the chat. With the SDK, users can engage directly with apps through buttons, cards, or widgets without leaving the conversation.</p><figure><img alt=""A preview of multiple mobile screens showing third-party apps like Tunedrop, Brick &amp; Basil, and BeatBot running inside ChatGPT’s interface, where users can browse maps, playlists, and restaurant cards directly within the chat window."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Hej5hziRSjflrud8yVOxhw.png"" /><figcaption>Image from OpenAI’s Apps SDK Design Guidelines illustrating how integrated apps visually coexist within ChatGPT’s conversation interface. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/concepts/design-guidelines""><em>OpenAI — Apps SDK Design Guidelines</em></a></figcaption></figure><h3>How the apps SDK boosts efficiency and product growth</h3><p>At this point, designers can probably already imagine how the Apps SDK begins to reshape the user experience. In essence, the SDK embodies the logic behind <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/hick-s-law-making-the-choice-easier-for-users"">Hick’s Law</a> and <a href=""https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/B9780128182024000131"">Fitts’s Law</a>: it reduces the visual noise that slows decision-making and shortens the physical distance between intention and completion.</p><p>Take Coursera for example. Previously, a learner exploring UX courses might spend minutes choosing which platform to open, typing “UX design” into a search bar, scrolling through long lists, and clicking in and out of pages to check ratings or instructors. Every choice added a moment of hesitation, fragmenting attention and stretching the time it took to act.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Coursera’s University of Michigan portal showing search results for “UX design,” with multiple course cards, filters for subjects and skills, and sorting options that make the interface visually dense and choice-heavy."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Vl6K_9wrgCzci7iXZ_LfcA.png"" /><figcaption>Image from Coursera’s page illustrating how users face a complex, multi-step interface when searching for UX design courses. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://www.coursera.org/programs/university-of-michigan-mrofm/browse?authProvider=umich&amp;query=ux+design&amp;source=search""><em>Coursera — University of Michigan UX Design Search</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>However, Coursera’s integration with ChatGPT illustrates a successful application of Hick’s Law principles, significantly reducing decision complexity. A learner can simply ask a question with natural language inside ChatGPT’s text field. A video preview of relevant courses then appears directly within the chat, reducing the number of immediate choices presented to the learner. Learners no longer needs to spend time filtering or comparing endless options in a long, scrolling list, thereby simplifying the selection process and dramatically decreasing the reaction time required to commit to a course.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot showing a Coursera video playing directly inside ChatGPT, where a user naturally asks follow-up questions about UX design concepts through text conversation, demonstrating seamless course discovery and learning."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Tqh-N6IQS_bT0pK2BbtbLw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Image illustrating how users can search for and explore UX design courses on Coursera directly within ChatGPT using natural language prompts. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/""><em>OpenAI — Introducing Apps in ChatGPT</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Some in-house designers might wonder what is the impact on their products. If users can complete tasks entirely inside ChatGPT, would they still visit the original app?</p><p>This concern is reasonable because the SDK might reduce users’ page-level engagement within the native environment. Yet the same decreased friction of opening the app can also widen the app’s reach. By allowing users to call the app directly within ChatGPT, the SDK raises visit frequency among existing members and opens the door for non-members to try it for the first time.</p><p>The experience no longer depends on downloading, logging in, or navigating to a separate website. Each interaction inside ChatGPT becomes an entry point that can lead to higher engagement and new conversions, expanding the app’s reach without adding extra steps.</p><h3>Designing experiences that belong in a conversation</h3><p>After understanding the broader impact of the Apps SDK, designers can start thinking about how to shape these experiences in practice.</p><p>Designing for the SDK means clearly defining who the users are, what their goals look like in context, and which parts of their workflow feel most natural to complete through conversation. The task must be specific enough for ChatGPT to assist, yet simple enough to avoid overwhelming the interaction.</p><p>OpenAI offers several guiding questions to help designers identify good use cases, each of which can also be viewed through the lens of <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/hick-s-law-making-the-choice-easier-for-users"">Hick’s Law</a>, showing how the SDK minimizes the number of decisions users need to make. Ask yourself:</p><ul><li><em>How do your user task fit naturally into a conversation? (for example, booking, ordering, scheduling, quick lookups)</em></li><li><em>Is it time-bound or action-oriented? (short or medium duration tasks with a clear start and end)</em></li><li><em>Is the information valuable in the moment? (users can act on it right away or get a concise preview before diving deeper)</em></li><li><em>Can it be summarized visually and simply? (one card, a few key details, a clear CTA)</em></li><li><em>Does it extend ChatGPT in a way that feels additive or differentiated?</em></li></ul><p>Designers should also avoid designing interfaces that:</p><ul><li><em>Display long-form or static content better suited for a website or app.</em></li><li><em>Require complex multi-step workflows that exceed the inline or fullscreen display modes.</em></li><li><em>Use the space for ads, upsells, or irrelevant messaging.</em></li><li><em>Surface sensitive or private information directly in a card where others might see it.</em></li><li><em>Duplicate ChatGPT’s system functions (for example, recreating the input composer).</em></li></ul><p>From most of these principles, we can notice that OpenAI encourages designers to <strong>avoid tasks that involve too many steps</strong>, or think about what <strong>information is valuable</strong> to show on the interface.</p><p>Take Figma SDK for example. The workflows like converting a short piece of text into a user flow represents a much stronger use case. It is easier for users to describe with natural language, and this information can immediate be summarized into visual feedback that users can act on right away.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot showing a user asking ChatGPT to convert a hand-drawn user-flow sketch into a digital diagram using the Figma app, with the finished flowchart displayed directly within the chat interface."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2LIxFdzjGAmW0XgFWsv2ew.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Image demonstrating how users can generate a complete user-flow diagram in Figma through a simple natural-language request and sketches inside ChatGPT. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/""><em>OpenAI — Introducing Apps in ChatGPT</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>In contrast, designing a complex design system with ChatGPT may not be a good user case. Because it require both users and computers to access complicate information on multiple design pages, and users have to constantly make fragmented decisions and repeatedly step in to guide the AI, which interrupts the flow of interaction and increases the overall time to complete a task.</p><p>For designers, building for the Apps SDK starts with defining a clear, focused task. ChatGPT favors apps that serve a single, well-scoped purpose, something users can complete in one short interaction. <strong>Try to describe your user’s key goal in plain language, outline its input and output, and make sure it fits naturally into a conversation.</strong></p><h3>Designing Interfaces that belong in a conversation</h3><p>OpenAI also provides a set of UI guidelines that can be examined through the lens of <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/hick-s-law-making-the-choice-easier-for-users"">Hick’s</a> and <a href=""https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/B9780128182024000131"">Fitts’s Law</a>.</p><p>For example, designers should display <strong>only the most relevant information</strong> and present it in a simple visual form, such as a clean card with a short list of three key items.</p><p>The guidelines also suggest limiting each card to a maximum of two primary actions: one main call to action and one optional secondary choice. These approach helps users <strong>find what they need without navigating through layers of menus or dense tables</strong>, allowing them to act more quickly.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration showing four examples of poor interface patterns for ChatGPT Apps SDK — multiple views, deep navigation, redundant features, and vertical scrolling — each marked with a red “X” to highlight unnecessary complexity."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*di-MpBfsMeBYsiC1lUbCeA.png"" /><figcaption>Image from OpenAI’s Apps SDK Design Guidelines emphasizing that ChatGPT app interfaces should avoid complex navigation and redundant elements. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/concepts/design-guidelines""><em>OpenAI — Apps SDK Design Guidelines</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Primary actions are usually placed at the bottom of the card, effectively <strong>reducing the distance the thumb-pointer must travel</strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram showing labeled interface elements within ChatGPT Apps SDK cards, including titles, edit controls, expandable maps, item lists, and primary action buttons like “Directions,” demonstrating structured layout design."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XzRY1Kz1PJX62MTAYGBbuA.png"" /><figcaption>Image from OpenAI’s Apps SDK Design Guidelines illustrating how different UI components are organized consistently within ChatGPT’s in-chat interface. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/concepts/design-guidelines""><em>OpenAI — Apps SDK Design Guidelines</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>When a card contains richer media such as images, maps, or interactive diagrams, the expand option can open a fullscreen view.

The focus moves <strong>toward designing flows, contexts, and systems</strong> that help users think clearly and act confidently. Designers must learn to define how an AI communicates, makes decisions, and aligns with human goals.</p><p>Yet no matter how advanced the system becomes, there will always be a need to clarify what people truly need, and bringing that clarity to complexity to just simple interactions.</p><h3>References:</h3><p>Bloomberg Originals.

<h4>Beneath Spotify’s algorithmic charm lies a growing problem: a platform flooded with songs made by no one.</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zfXa_RV7wghv9shRcO7ycw.png"" /><figcaption>Image of a robot singing and playing Guitar</figcaption></figure><p>Music has always been important in my household. I have fond and vivid memories of mornings starting off the day with my dad playing Ottis Redding’s Sitting on the Dock of the Bay on the record player. Music was how we connected. So over the years, he’d send me Spotify recommendations, mostly stuck in the ’60s, oftentimes some repetitive blues songs, I’d happily listen, grateful for that small bridge between generations and to connect with my dad.</p><p>Then one morning, that bridge cracked.</p><h3>The fake artist incident</h3><p>My dad texted me: <em>“Have you heard of Mel McCoy from the Country Bayou Blues Band?”</em> Attached was a Spotify link and an image of a haggard old blues man in a cowboy hat. While my knowledge of wrinkly blues men ain’t bad, I hadn’t heard of him…because well, he didn’t exist. The song was AI-generated, a synthetic blues track wrapped in a fake persona.</p><p>That small exchange, sent a jolt through me. It made me realize how quickly the ground beneath us was shifting. Spotify was now quietly filling with music made by absolutely no one at all.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/630/0*55WU9Pc0Fb0iBzXT.jpg"" /><figcaption>AI image of blue man named Mel McCoy</figcaption></figure><h3>Spotify’s AI crackdown (the numbers that don’t add up)</h3><p>Recently, Spotify announced that it had removed more than <a href=""https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-09-25/spotify-strengthens-ai-protections/""><strong>75 million “spammy” AI-generated tracks</strong></a> from the platform. Hard to believe as they purport to have just over <a href=""https://newsroom.spotify.com/company-info/"">100 million tracks in total</a>, which would mean more than half of its entire catalogue was removed if taken at face value. The company framed it as a victory for authenticity, but the scale strains belief and it its true that nearly two-thirds of their music was AI generated, then that is a grave proposition.</p><p>If there were truly that many synthetic songs circulating, then AI-generated music isn’t some fringe experiment, it’s a massive part of the musical ecosystem. And if the number is inflated, then Spotify is trying to control the narrative rather than the problem. Either way, the message is clear: AI music is no longer a nightmare of Spotify’s future. It’s the present.</p><p>In some ways, it feels like Spotify has been preparing us for this shift for years. Its earliest “AI” features felt benign verging on kinda fun! Personalized recommendations, <em>Discover Weekly</em>, and shared “Blend” playlists that merged two people’s tastes to create a musical mutant baby. Then came <em>Daylists</em>, those weirdly specific playlists titled things like <em>spaced out international wednesday afternoon</em>. Note by note, Spotify has moved from being a place to explore music to a place where music finds you.</p><p>I admit, these features are annoyingly convenient. But they beg a deeper question: what problem is Spotify really trying to solve?</p><p>Unfortunately the answer is obvious, like every platform these days, its engagement. Keep you listening for as long as possible. That’s why songs automatically roll into “radio” mode after they end, and why playlists refresh endlessly.</p><p>At first, I loved it. It felt like I had a tiny DJ whose only job was to find me music to listen to. But eventually I realized that those recommendations don’t actually mirror how I used to discover music. I used to discover music through friends, conversations, cafés, record stores, or god forbid, even the radio!</p><p>It might sound quaint or cheugy, but discovery used to be an act of active participation. Music discovery was something you <em>got to do</em>, not something that was done <em>for</em> you.</p><p>Music is a deeply personal experience, which is very different from a deeply <strong>personalized</strong> one. And because we don’t understand how Spotify’s algorithms steer us, it’s hard to know whose interests they really serve. Maybe they’re agnostic, maybe they just wanna be like an enthusiastic record store employee (I know it’s an oxymoron) but more likely, their purpose isn’t sharing art that they care about, it’s retention!</p><h3>The quiet rise of AI music</h3><p>Over the past year, AI-generated music on Spotify has exploded. Despite public statements about regulation and moderation, the company’s behavior suggests a more grey relationship with synthetic sound.</p><p>In 2024, <a href=""https://www.spotify.com/ca-en/legal/end-user-agreement/"">Spotify updated its <strong>User Agreemen</strong></a><strong>t</strong> to give itself broad, perpetual rights over anything users upload or create. Many artists feared that language could allow the company to train AI systems on their recordings or generate derivative tracks, a concern Spotify dismissed but never fully clarified.</p><p>The fear is obvious, Spotify could use its vast dataset, every stream, skip, and playlist to generate music that sounds “good enough” to replace the real thing. By leveraging artists’ work, it could create AI versions of them, cut out the original creators, and pocket the difference. It sounds dystopian, but economically, it makes sense. Spotify’s business model rewards quantity over quality. AI-generated music offers infinite supply at almost no cost.</p><p>You might think, well, I would never listen and fully enjoy AI music but I know from experience that more and more you won’t know. A lot of people, myself included have become passive participants in this weird musical system. When we pick playlists “for vibes” Chill Jazz, Study Lo-Fi, Relaxing Guitar, we rarely check who made the tracks. And those playlists are rife with artists that are aliases for production collectives or outright AI projects. The music is serviceable, mood-fitting, and free of friction. But every AI track streamed is a quiet rehearsal for a world where human artistry might become optional.</p><p>My mom, for example, listens to AI music happily. She finds it catchy and harmless. She doesn’t go to concerts, so why does it matter who made the song? My dad, meanwhile, has become paranoid. He now messages me links, asking, “Is this one real?”</p><p>Between them lies the cultural crossroads we’re all standing at: comfort on one side, paranoia on the other.</p><h3>Follow the incentives</h3><p>For Spotify, the math is hard to ignore: AI-generated songs mean no royalties, no scheduling conflicts, no egos. Just endless, on-brand audio that never sleeps. For musicians, that means competing not with each other but with tailor made algorithms that can make a million forgettable songs overnight.</p><p>We’re already seeing this battle spill into court. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/jun/25/record-labels-sue-ai-song-generator-apps-copyright-infringement-lawsuit""><strong>Universal Music Group</strong> and the <strong>RIAA</strong> have sued AI startups like <strong>Suno</strong> and <strong>Udio</strong></a> for training on copyrighted works without permission. Those cases will define whether training an AI on music constitutes infringement and the outcome will determine how far platforms like Spotify can go before crossing a legal line.</p><p>If those lawsuits fail, the floodgates open.</p><p>In my opinion, Spotify isn’t resisting AI, it’s refining it. The company’s policies and incentives point toward a future where the platform doesn’t just <em>curate</em> music but <em>creates</em> it. Probably a bit paranoid, but in this age of AI where everything seems to quickly get gobbled up and regurgitated by LLM’s its not an unreasonable paranoia. I hope for a future where we could simply filter out AI generated music. <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2025-07-31/spotifys-ceo-owns-an-ai-weapons-company-some-musicians-say-its-time-to-leave"">Spotify doesn’t seem to mind so far and their morally grey track record makes me worry.</a> I hope things don’t go in this direction, because for me, music without a maker isn’t music at all.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a4d6729c715b"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/spotify-has-an-ai-problem-a4d6729c715b"">Spotify has an AI problem</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

We will continue to be captivated by them even through the times of AI.</p><h4><strong>Why narrative matters</strong></h4><p>Jordan Peterson says, “<em>It is the near-simultaneous discovery by literary critics, researchers into robotics and artificial intelligence, cognitive scientists and neuropsychologists alike that we do and even must perceive reality through a story. Or more accurately, they discovered that a story is a portrayal of the structure through which we perceive reality.”</em></p><p>Our world is too complex to navigate without direction and purpose. To help us make sense of our reality, we create narratives that help filter and focus on what matters.</p><p>The real-life stories that inspire us, the fictional stories that stretch our imagination, business stories that motivate us, and ideological stories that unite or divide us evolve into overarching meta-narratives we inhabit, whether we are aware of it or not. Surprisingly, we are often drawn to the ones that help us cope with our struggles and the wounds we carry. They attempt to provide answers to our deeper human need for identity, belonging, significance, purpose, and transcendence.</p><p>For example, “<em>The American Dream</em>” is a popular cultural meta-narrative in which the story of prosperity and success is attainable through hard work, grit, and determination. “<em>Rags to Riches</em>” is another story archetype of a journey from poverty or obscurity to a position of great wealth, success, or fame. Many such meta-narratives exist. They could be of a political, cultural, ethnic, historical, or religious nature.</p><p>It is essential to recognise that we all inhabit such meta-narratives, and they hold utmost importance personally. Whatever doesn’t fit one’s narrative often fails to register as meaningful or important.</p><p>When a business wants to be successful, the narratives its customers inhabit, shaped by the challenges they face, the emotions they experience, and the aspirations they strive for, must be at the heart of the company’s story.</p><h4><strong>Understanding story design</strong></h4><p>Steve Jobs, the great business storyteller, said, “<em>The most powerful person in the world is the storyteller. The storyteller sets the vision, values and agenda of an entire generation that is to come.”</em></p><p>However, in 1983, when he launched Lisa, he released a nine-page ad in the New York Times, explaining all its technical features, which nobody outside of NASA was interested in. The computer failed. But after he left Apple, his experience at Pixar or Nike’s <em>‘Just do it’ </em>campaign may have convinced him of the power of story. That’s why when he returned, his understanding of the business changed. He focused on the emotions, frustrations, and aspirations of their customers who felt they were the crazy ones, misfits and rebels. Then he said to them, “<em>Think different”</em></p><p>Earlier, Apple’s story was all about itself. Its new story is its customer’s story. “<em>(1) It identified what their customers wanted (to be seen and heard), (2) idefined their customers’ challenges (that people did not recognise their hidden genius), and (3) offered their customers a tool they could use to express themselves emotionally (computers and smartphones).</em>”</p><p>While facilitating <em>Kintsugi Story</em> workshops at <em>Mountain Retreat</em>, I am slowly coming to learn how different circumstances draw us to particular narratives. They could be our existential needs, psychological wounds, childhood formation, past experiences, social status, and so on.</p><p>In a story, what the character wants and aspires to become is often perceived as a cure for the fears/trauma the character encountered in the past.</p><p>In fiction writing, they call it a character’s ghost; it is something in your character’s past that haunts him in the present. Every person carries their past wounds and struggles. Our perception of our world is shaped by the wounds and fears that our past experiences have created. These may not always be very traumatic incidents; they could be small feelings of neglect, inability or instability, etc., during childhood. Fortunately for some, those wounds heal, leaving scars nevertheless.</p><p>Apple’s core audience for its personal computer was artists, designers, and students, who often felt like outsiders in the technology space. They felt people did not recognise their hidden genius; they felt neglected. Apple echoed their emotions and praised their perceived identity as the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels. The <em>Think Different</em> narrative resonated with these people because Apple cared about their frustrations and told a transformative story.</p><p>I want to call Steve Jobs a great business story-thinker, not just a storyteller, because he designed his business around his customers’ narrative. He created products and services that showed a better future. This created a lasting impact on his customers because he empathised with their emotional needs and the fears they carried.</p><p>It is debatable whether Apple’s products truly created a positive impact on our generation. That is a different topic for another day. Nevertheless, the influence was deeper. Story thinking is a powerful skill to either positively transform people or manipulate them. People in power always use it for the latter goal.</p><p>Most people are often ignorant of the narratives we inhabit. But, when someone articulates the story they’re living, it creates a moment of recognition — <em>‘Yes, that’s exactly how I feel.’ </em>Rene Girard said, <em>“Man is the creature who does not know what to desire, and he turns to others in order to make up his mind. We desire what others desire because we imitate their desires.”</em></p><p>Our desires and our narratives are mediated through others, especially our models. Models are those who we are captivated by, those with lofty aims, and we wish, if we are brave, we could be possessed by their spirit. We not only desire the things that they desire, but we also desire to become like them. <em>“All desire is a desire for being.” </em>― Rene Girard.</p><p>If businesses need to make sense to their customers, they need to articulate their story through their models. When people buy Apple products, they are buying into Steve Jobs’ narrative that misfits, creatives, and rebels can become geniuses just like him.</p><p>Apple doesn’t sell computers; they sell “<em>think different</em>”. It’s a narrative about creativity, rebellion against conformity, and belonging to an elite tribe of geniuses.</p><p>Nike doesn’t sell shoes; they sell “<em>the athlete in you</em>”. It’s a ‘hero’s journey’ narrative about overcoming obstacles and achieving one’s potential.</p><p>However, narratives are not just the stories we tell our customers. First, it is the customer’s story we tell ourselves, and then let it inform us in creating products that meet their needs.</p><p>Donald Miller says, “<em>What most brands miss, however, is that there are three levels of problems a customer encounters. In stories, heroes encounter external, internal and philosophical problems. Why? Because these are the same three-level problems human beings face in their everyday lives.</em>” To put it simply, an external problem, which is often tangible, causes our customers to experience an internal frustration, which is philosophically wrong!</p><p>In an era of abundance, great products don’t just solve surface-level problems — they help us become who we want to be. The more brands address the deeper needs for identity, belonging, significance, purpose and transcendence, the more they connect with customers and the broader industry and culture. Mere utility-centred products can be quickly replaced.</p><p>Does it make sense only for multi-billion-dollar companies? No, even a mom-and-pop shop that is empathetic to customers’ needs, fears, and aspirations can become successful.</p><p>Moreover, narrative design is not just for the MVP stage; it is a continuous effort, as narratives must evolve in tandem with cultures.</p><h4><strong>Designing narrative products</strong></h4><p>To build the right narrative for our customers, we need to strengthen our right-hemisphere thinking in our organisations. Unfortunately, most product design and development is dominated by left-hemisphere thinking.</p><p>McGilchrist, in his book ‘<em>The master and his emissary’</em>, argues that the two hemispheres don’t divide tasks by type (logical vs. creative), but rather by how they attend to the world. The left hemisphere offers narrow, focused attention — it grasps things in isolation, categorises, and manipulates. It sees the world as static, knowable, and mechanical. We end up building what we can measure, not what matters. However, the right hemisphere provides broad, sustained attention — it perceives context, relationships, and the whole. It remains open to what is new, ambiguous, and alive.</p><p>He uses the bird foraging for food while watching out for predators as a central analogy for the two hemispheres’ different and often competing modes of attention.</p><p>Narratives are fundamentally right-hemisphere phenomena. You can’t understand a story by dissecting it into data points or features. Narrative dead products may work efficiently, but they lack significance on a deeper level. A more efficient product could easily replace them.</p><p>For example, here is what a pure left-hemisphere restaurant (let’s call it OptimalBite) owner may say, <em>“Our Q3 data shows table turnover averaging 47 minutes. Competitors are at 42. We’re losing 10.6% revenue per seat per day.”</em> Whereas a dominant right-hemisphere owner (let’s call it Nonna’s Kitchen) may say, <em>“Our customers — they’re exhausted. Overworked. Disconnected. They’re hungry for belonging. I want them to feel that they have come to their grandmother’s kitchen in Tuscany. To feel they are home. They belong.”</em></p><p>But when you ask customers from the former restaurant? <em>“It’s fine. It’s convenient. The food is… okay.” </em>What will the customers from the latter restaurant say? <em>“We’ve been coming here for five years. The chef remembered my husband died last year and gave us a special toast in his memory.”</em></p><p>Right-hemisphere thinking involves seeing the whole before the parts, which means capturing context, emotions, and behaviour — that is, understanding products within the customer’s life narrative. This involves asking questions like, How do products fit into the actual lived context of people’s lives? What are the larger cultural/meta narratives at play? What fears and frustrations do they carry?</p><p>Understand which archetypal narrative resonates with your customers. For example, the ‘hero’s journey’, the ‘mastery story’, etc. Which narrative rings true emotionally? What kind of person does this product encourage users to become?</p><p>Ask how your product intersects with customers’ lives. Grasp what the product <em>means </em>metaphorically and philosophically, understanding human connections and their identity formation and see products as part of a journey, not isolated moments or features.</p><p>Right-hemisphere thinking prioritises synthesis over analysis. It fosters ecosystem thinking, allowing for ambiguity and narrative evolution, and remains open to new and unexpected possibilities.</p><p>Story-first businesses begin by studying their customers, the stories they are living, capturing their emotions, frustrations and aspirations. Field trips, contextual enquiries, day-in-the-life immersions, story workshops, model mapping, story pattern mapping, among others.</p><p>Airbnb started as a great story-first company; it was revolutionary. However, today it has drifted to standardisation, efficiency, and algorithms. Now it is like any other hospitality business.</p><p>The key is that right-hemisphere practices don’t replace left-hemisphere rigour — they inform it. Both are necessary. But the right must lead.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zIiGEf8tFvAoP478yBQLpQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Nike’s “Just Do It” narrative ad, 1988 © Nike</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>The ethics of narrative design</strong></h4><p>Narrative design is also a powerful tool for manipulation because it exploits some of the fundamental human emotions and needs.</p><p>In any good story, the protagonist begins believing a lie — a flawed narrative in Act 1 — but is very convinced. However, at the midpoint of Act 2, a crisis point in the story, the protagonist has been struggling under the burden of his lie. At this moment, he finally sees the Truth. When he chooses to accept it (which will cost him a lot, even his life), transformation begins. It leads to a new, wholesome narrative with renewed aspirations.</p><p>Good stories are about people facing challenges that test them. Transformation is the evidence that the test mattered — that going through the fire either forged something stronger or revealed what was already there. Without transformation, we’re left wondering: what was the point of this story?</p><p>People are drawn to narratives that take them from a state of lack to a more complete and fulfilled one, as they perceive it, inspired by their models. Apple iPhone customers may discover that they have become more creative or better storytellers, just like their model Steve Jobs himself.</p><p>Most of the compelling narratives promise transformation. It’s often what separates a good story from a manipulative one. Or a good product from a poor one. A good product is like a wise guide that enables customers’ transformation.</p><p>Customer transformation should be at the heart of a great product narrative, not manipulation, because transformation is valued higher than instant gratification. For example, social media platforms hijack our need for belonging and significance, creating narratives where we’re constantly performing for validation. Manipulative narratives do thrive, but not for long.</p><p>The right hemisphere has a unique capacity to perceive inherent value and meaning. Iain McGilchrist refers to it as valueception. Philosopher Max Scheler originally introduced the concept in his ‘<em>Hierarchy of Values’</em>. He classifies values into a four-rank pyramid, from the lowest to the highest. At the lowest, he places pleasure values, then vital values, and finally spiritual values, such as truth, goodness, and beauty. At the top, he places the sacred values.</p><p>Scheler argued that the <em>depth</em> and <em>quality</em> of the satisfaction we feel is directly tied to the <em>rank</em> of the value it corresponds to. Therefore, products that embody higher-order values such as integrity, honesty, truth, and beauty, in contrast with mere utility value, offer sustained and deeper satisfaction.</p><p>For example, Nonna’s kitchen, which fostered genuine community (spiritual value), is highly valued over Optimalbite, which cared for convenience (pleasure value).</p><p>A transformative story sets the character on a journey to the sacred, whereas a manipulative story takes the character in the opposite direction.</p><p><em>“When a person can’t find a deep sense of meaning, they distract themselves with pleasure” — Viktor Frankl</em>.</p><p>This may sound great now, but does it hold in an Agentic future?</p><h4><strong>Narrative products in Agentic future</strong></h4><p>In a speculative future where we set goals for AI systems to make decisions and act on our behalf, this suggests that customers may not interact with brands directly in that digital space.</p><p>In the Agentic AI paradigm, if customers interact only with AI agents, which in turn interact with multiple brands and systems based on the criteria that are configured, then it appears that brand narratives may lose their power and break the mimetic desire loop, as most products become mere commodities for a narrative agnostic agent.</p><p>If the future unfolds in this way, brand narratives will become even more crucial for products to make sense to customers, or face the fate of extinction in the algorithmic optimisation. Narrative dead products or services will become commodities or mere tasks in a curated algorithmic world.</p><p>However, we humans do not always seek optimal solutions in everything; everyone wants a narrative to live for.</p><p>When agents will have to become the narrative mediators, brands will have to create their narrative agents, and digital products need to become agentic.</p><p>Regardless, physical, embodied experiences will remain crucial because certain narrative elements resist digital mediation — such as community rituals and sensory experiences. Brands need to foster real-world community experiences to strengthen the narrative to meet our deeper need for belonging.</p><p>On the negative side, as social media intensified narratives and their memetic processes exponentially, in the marketplace of Agentic AI, people can be trapped in a narrative echo chamber curated by AI agents. Even worse, governments or institutions can enforce their agents for compliance or control, and kill other narratives. This can be catastrophic for human flourishing. Therefore, it is important to protect ourselves with authentic and transformative narratives that inspire us.</p><p>Designing narrative-driven products and their agents is an emerging area to watch for.</p><p>For further reading<br />1. <a href=""https://www.amazon.in/Whole-New-Mind-Right-Brainers-Future/dp/1594481717/ref=sr_1_1?crid=UAYLS01WIP8S&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.C9nLNzK5RXjGHmsdmK1pGEvTht3bkrxTds-eDTDYAeBBgrhLUj29VJHNvH0d-wjT7xQqndKfi27Fvk1DGsi3o9nZRa07NuptQUTUOSzUW8pffbq3WP0MsxCSJGpMEsoe0hL393p_44mxkb2FIhnub9Mdlu46FTwoZVK4xQPqh-fquSuPkOAYINCQou-o2jH1UibQZk30PZ2E0WU5YOOtK_ItG_ijoCJI1nXWhwLY6Ms.B6oCDgbMJZwTaEMcixR5UwMzD4sMCkocFt3PMGfF5W4&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=whole+new+mind&amp;qid=1760810180&amp;sprefix=whole+new+mind%2Caps%2C232&amp;sr=8-1""><em>A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future</em></a> by Daniel Pink<br />2. <a href=""https://www.amazon.in/MASTER-EMISSARY-EXPANDED-Iain-Mcgilchrist/dp/0300245920/ref=sr_1_1?crid=29DU9JNTGNHEC&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.JdaQFJPcrWnhaAKG_Qc3mefOJ_aCjVR1FjvgqLr-uy1IBbuIIGtr67gicGXIf8KHw7zzYWn6qLT4m5Wmiwq1kNKqhZrOaVmWF3UmAIQ82CdGCqpnHW25Ek7miQb7KDrudi7yJgOgZWk28egmrte7Cw.ArdnNZ2jtL0wcoDk1tdaxcDywDmVz1FZckABU20w188&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=the+master+and+his+emissary&amp;qid=1760810276&amp;sprefix=Master+and+emis%2Caps%2C216&amp;sr=8-1""><em>Master and his emissary</em></a> by Iain Mcgilchrist<br />3. <a href=""https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0141033576/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=A3H3WE9M6NY1KV&amp;psc=1""><em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em></a><em> </em>by Daniel Kahneman<br />4. <a href=""https://www.amazon.in/Story-Structure-Substance-Principles-Screenwriting/dp/0060391685/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2T5OPI4TD6YPM&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.SY6skpwlFjfvpGICdsse9ltgjz9OPwOJqxFjDhKxmvc4mSyFreZQ0Ht9DU-HyUsZA46wPWfPGdMZt8EULsTbdy9u_mRxYEKAMpAePbEnhMFXaLIYmGwavrPK8qNYFfGhffks-IgWVhvLp2RBhPNML57FeG04AUquqeE-_-geoG8iFgGwH5tLelwKZ0jrgezYzFYKDMFpT0W4qtppXWWUxMMs8z-u01_LYXEjd_TZuy4.sVFbNnpG8VtfkWU0pKP4pCO-NJV1GbX7M9KMxffErNQ&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=story+Robert+McKee&amp;qid=1761076967&amp;sprefix=story+robert+mckee%2Caps%2C285&amp;sr=8-1""><em>Story: Style, Structure, Substance, and the Principles of Screenwriting</em></a> by Robert Mckee<br />5. <a href=""https://www.amazon.in/Building-StoryBrand-2-0-Clarify-Customers/dp/1400253713/ref=sr_1_1?crid=18RDQTSZYQC9A&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.m5ARGEL4YoPCtotNv_d85cob0tU7WlMuZtuo83ECSF24x40-lDvuENdI-zW1m7RtMWOjC7f4thXcAGuMHeztJxCZe8e-s0suJrBXMtiCwv48J2gKezJVwnVFQGjFlFn59LXu8ow1OEgEI9b6xq_zZkRVunPWc55-a6IU9UdDxeBQYmMe-JZ1lzntWVn_Se9eT9MZ3MCn2_AQpov3M7jRfQQy17L-pPtnaCsjtC6j6t4.39ONQAfRbgHP4-u7Me73VwV4rNDcNwAegZmWdORCWYQ&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=building+a+story+brand+by+donald+miller&amp;qid=1761077080&amp;sprefix=story+brand+%2Caps%2C222&amp;sr=8-1""><em>Building a StoryBrand 2.0 : Clarify Your Message So Customers Will Listen</em></a> by Donald Millar</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9a50e28caae9"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/right-narratives-shape-lasting-products-9a50e28caae9"">Right narratives shape lasting products</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

But while many focus on the technical capabilities, I’m more interested in the broader narrative shaping these discussions. And recently, based on my observations, that narrative is shifting. The early fear that machines might erode the very qualities that make us human is giving way to a different anxiety—FoMO.</p><p><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563213000800"">FoMO — fear of missing out — is more than a buzzword</a>. Psychologists define it as the anxious belief that others are gaining opportunities or rewards that we’re excluded from. It’s not a fear of loss, but of being left behind while the world moves ahead.</p><p>It seems like only yesterday we were discussing <a href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/19/1075140/how-existential-risk-became-biggest-meme-in-ai/"">existential risks</a>, automation’s threat to work, and the unsettling possibility that <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/03/27/the-intersection-of-ai-and-human-creativity-can-machines-really-be-creative/"">creativity itself might be mechanized</a>. Now we talk mostly about how to “<a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/91278500/how-to-make-generative-ai-a-partner-in-your-daily-workflow"">integrate</a>” AI into our workflows, how to “<a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-stay-competitive-ai-era-openai-cfo-sarah-friar-2025-8"">stay competitive</a>,” and how not to miss the wave.</p><p>So what changed? Have we given up? Or have we simply convinced ourselves that AI won’t harm humanity. More likely, it’s because the rewards of this technology are immediate and obvious, while the costs are slow and subtle.</p><p>AI provides us speed, convenience, and capability — and it offers them now. But the erosion it causes creeps in quietly, almost imperceptibly. And because of this subtle degradation, we fail to treat it with the urgency it deserves.</p><p>However, out of all the potential consequences such as <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2025/04/25/the-jobs-that-will-fall-first-as-ai-takes-over-the-workplace/"">job replacement</a>, <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/03/27/the-intersection-of-ai-and-human-creativity-can-machines-really-be-creative/"">creative outsourcing</a>, and <a href=""https://technologymagazine.com/news/ai-giants-accused-of-the-largest-ip-theft-in-music-history"">intellectual theft</a>, what troubles me most is the silent replacement of human effort with efficiency— a trade that feels harmless in the moment but carries profound consequences over time.</p><p>Take students, for example — a group I see up close. Under the illusion they’re being efficient (or duplicitous in some cases), they utilize AI to generate ideas or complete work, outsourcing the most essential part of learning — the struggle.</p><p>When we skip the messy and difficult decisions that build the foundation of <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-importance-of-taste-and-other-lies-we-tell-ourselves-b5caacddbec4"">judgment</a>, we never develop the critical skills needed to distinguish strong work from weak.</p><p>Judgment is not something we’re born with, it’s something shaped by repeated trial and error. It takes root in wrestling with constraints, making mistakes, and steadily refining our instincts. Remove the struggle, and the capacity for discernment withers.</p><p>A clear example is someone using AI to build a simple landing page. If they don’t know how to code, they can’t judge whether the output is any good — they have to trust the system. Yet AI still makes errors, even on straightforward tasks like citing accurate sources. The same problem appears in design or writing, where assessing quality is even harder for those without expertise.</p><p>This is a major reason why <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16078"">seasoned professionals now hold a greater advantage than ever</a>—they have access to both the tools and the wisdom, while juniors have only the tools — tools that are steadily eroding their ability to gain valuable experience the way pre-AI generations did.</p><p>As individual discernment atrophies, the collective standard drops too. Across disciplines, the more AI fills the space with what many describe as “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_slop"">AI slop</a>”, the less we train ourselves to recognize what is excellent. Culture becomes saturated with “good enough” work that looks polished but lacks substance. Over time, we lose sight of what depth even is.</p><p>This is why effort matters. We stand in awe of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine_Chapel"">Sistine Chapel</a> or are moved by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-fFHeTX70Q"">Beethoven</a> not just because of their beauty, but because they embody human striving. They carry the weight of years, mistakes, and relentless pursuit.</p><p>If a machine produced the same artifacts tomorrow, they might be identical, but their meaning would evaporate. Without elements of human labor — physical or psychological — such art is reduced to decoration.</p><figure><img alt=""A person gazes at the Sistine Chapel’s intricate, colorful ceiling and wall frescoes, depicting biblical scenes with vivid figures and dynamic movement."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y6Q8NXeG2OXzz5fxAKOqzg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>What frustrates me most is that these aren’t side effects — they’re seismic shifts that demand serious attention. Yet our feeds are flooded with influencers and pseudo-experts insisting that AI is good because it frees us from “tedious” work for “higher-level” tasks. There’s some truth in that — yes, that’s how it <em>should</em> be used — but that’s not how it’s actually being used.</p><p>I know because I catch myself leaning on it for tasks I should be able to do — and do quickly — on my own, especially those that require a touch of humanity, like a sympathetic email to a colleague. Or shaping a big idea that should start with my own vision. It’s an unsettling tendency I’m confident others can relate to.</p><p>But all of these concerns are routinely dismissed as inconvenient footnotes to the next AI product launch. And this is all taking place while a <a href=""https://time.com/7322418/chat-gpt-open-ai-nvidia-tech-monopoly/"">handful of corporations</a> — companies like Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and OpenAI — are consolidating control over the infrastructure of culture itself. And we, as spectators, seem willing to watch as they chip away at what makes us human, all in the name of efficiency and our fixation on the next shiny innovation.</p><p>Maybe the most insidious part of this whole phenomenon is how normalized it’s become. Companies slap “AI-powered” onto products that don’t need it, like “gluten-free” labels on steak, because it’s easier to follow the trend than to ask if the trend makes sense.</p><p>Professionals and students panic that they’ll be unemployable if they don’t master these tools. Creatives worry they’ll be irrelevant if they don’t use them. And so everyone piles in — not out of conviction, but out of fear.</p><p>Conversations about purpose and meaning are being drowned out by the noise. These questions still surface, but they disappear beneath the hype faster than new AI startups can cash in.</p><p>And yet, for all this cynicism, hope isn’t gone. The technology is not destiny. It’s a mirror. It reflects our values back at us. If we allow convenience, speed, and efficiency to be our highest values, AI will amplify those — and hollow out everything else. But if we insist on preserving depth, effort, wisdom, and meaning, AI could become a tool that serves those ends rather than undermines them.</p><p>The choice is still ours, though it grows harder with each passing month. Words like these often echo unheard — and that may be the strongest reason to pause now. The real danger isn’t that machines will surpass us, but that in our desperation not to miss out, we’ll forget that being human means sometimes slowing down and doing things the hard way — because that’s how we grow.</p><p><strong><em>Don’t miss out! </em></strong><a href=""https://micbuckcreative.medium.com/subscribe""><strong><em>Join my email list</em></strong></a><strong><em> and receive the latest content.</em></strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=d628aacfb950"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/fear-of-missing-out-on-ai-is-overshadowing-the-fear-of-losing-our-humanity-d628aacfb950"">Fear of missing out on AI is overshadowing the fear of losing our humanity</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939482.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings, the sky is still rippling with the emotional, existential echoes of last week’s Jupiter–Chiron square, and many of us are noticing which parts of our inner child still feel exposed, reactive, or defensive. Jupiter in Cancer wants to nurture and expand whatever it’s touching — but squaring Chiron in Aries can feel like an overwhelming magnifying glass on the sore spots we’ve tried to outgrow. You may notice themes around independence vs. support, overfunctioning vs. receiving, or childhood family roles vs. your current adult boundaries. The key? Don’t try to “fix” yourself… move with yourself. Let your body release some of the internal pressure. Dance, cry, write, scream, walk barefoot in the grass. You’re allowed to <em>feel</em> and <em>heal</em> at the same time.<br /><br />And here comes a bit of lightness: Mercury, Planet of Communication, enters Sagittarius on October 29th, helping the collective release some of that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio heaviness we’ve been marinating in</a>. Mercury in Scorpio had us speaking in riddles, keeping secrets, obsessing over the unsaid, or analyzing every look and silence. We’ve been reading between the lines for weeks — not just in others, but in ourselves too. There’s beauty in that depth, but also a risk of becoming paranoid, withdrawn, or overly cynical. Now, Mercury in Sagittarius swings open the windows. It doesn’t whisper; it shouts joyfully from the rooftop. This is your permission slip to share what you’ve learned, even if it’s still messy or raw. Say it with humor, with honesty, with heart.</p>



<p>Also: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars is in its final degrees of Scorpio</a> this week. If you trace back to September 22nd, when Mars first entered the sign of the phoenix, you might notice that you’ve been undergoing some sort of personal mission — a deep, unflinching investigation of power, passion, and purpose. As Mars approaches 29° of Scorpio, it becomes a culmination moment. A final test. A last temptation. Or, a moment of confirmation that yes, you’ve changed — even if no one else knows how much. The shift becomes clear as Mars enters Sagittarius on November 4th, but this week is your last chance to harvest the lessons of your own underworld journey.You may find yourself asking: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fall-equinox-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects""><em>What did I begin around the equinox</em></a><em> that’s reaching its climax now? What am I finally ready to release — or claim?</em> This week doesn’t rush you to answer, but it will keep nudging you toward clarity.<br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, just because it looks like stillness doesn’t mean it’s not power. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars, your ruling planet, is finishing its six-week trek through Scorpio</a> — your sector of intimacy, control, transformation, and energetic merging. But unlike some of the more dramatic Mars moments, this finale doesn’t scream. It simmers. You’ve been slowly, maybe even secretly, building momentum around something deeply personal. Whether it’s a financial entanglement, a physical craving, or an emotional reckoning, this week could reveal just how much you’ve outgrown the need to “win” at all costs. Do you really need to dominate, or are you just scared of disappearing if you don’t? Mars in Scorpio has been showing you how to reclaim your power without losing your soul. Now’s the time to integrate what you’ve learned about vulnerability, pleasure, and restraint.<br /><br />The week ends with a mic drop — or at least a one-liner. Mercury enters Sagittarius on the 29th, launching you into a more playful, philosophical headspace. Suddenly, you’re inspired to sign up for that course, book that spontaneous trip, or tell a story that’s 80% true but 100% entertaining. And honestly? We need that from you. Just be mindful that not everyone’s as down for blunt jokes or semi-accurate monologues as you are. Mercury here wants you to express your belief systems, but do it like a good stand-up set: hit ‘em with the truth and the punchline.</p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, you can’t carry someone else’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-get-closure-ex-meaning"">relationship baggage</a> and call it love. Mars is wrapping up its journey through your sector of partnership, and if it’s been exposing some passive-aggressive tension or behind-the-scenes resentment, you’re not imagining things. But this final stretch isn’t about confrontation… it’s about clarity. You’ve likely realized that your energy has limits, and the desire to merge has to be mutual. This week, ask yourself: <em>What does it look like to stay connected while still protecting your peace?</em> Mars in Scorpio didn’t just reveal others’ patterns; it showed you your own default settings in connection, especially the ways you overextend or under-express. Let this week be an energetic recalibration in love, business, and even your relationship with your own reflection.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Mercury enters your “let’s talk about the money” zone. Starting October 29th, you may find yourself talking about loans, inheritances, taxes, or even kink. Mercury in Sagittarius isn’t subtle, and when it activates your sector of shared resources and taboo topics, you’re basically in your <em>Succession</em> era — equal parts honest and unhinged. Don’t be surprised if a conversation gets way deeper than expected. Or way weirder. You’re learning to speak your truths even when they’re not pretty — and laugh about them when you’re done.</p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, you don’t always need to optimize yourself. Sometimes you just need to rest. Mars has been powering through your sector of routine, health, and responsibility since September, and now it’s almost out. This week, instead of trying to finish everything on your to-do list like you’re being filmed for a productivity documentary, check in with your body. Where are you pushing too hard? What are you avoiding by staying “busy”? Mars in Scorpio taught you how to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/burnout-at-work-recovery-tips"">confront burnout patterns</a> and perfectionist tendencies. Let yourself integrate. It’s not weakness to pause — it’s strategy. Your real power move this week is listening to your body when it whispers, not waiting until it screams.<br /><br />On a lighter note, your crush might start texting in full paragraphs again. Mercury (your ruler!) enters your opposite sign of Sagittarius on the 29th, lighting up your one-on-one connection zone. This means: more banter, bolder flirting, and possibly deeper conversations with someone who’s actually emotionally available (what a concept). It’s cuffing season, but with memes. You’re feeling more honest, and so are they — even if it’s oversharing in a “sorry-not-sorry” way. Don’t overanalyze the vibe. Lean in. Say what you mean. And maybe download Hinge again… but only if your last message wasn’t left on read.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, not all passion is sustainable… but some of it is worth the mess. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars in Scorpio is finishing its slow burn</a> through your romance, creativity, and pleasure zone, and this week is your chance to reflect on what, or who, lit you up since late September. Maybe you’ve taken bigger risks with your art, your heart, or your bed sheets. Maybe you’ve confused chaos with chemistry once or twice (hey, it’s a learning curve). But this final stretch of Mars in Scorpio isn’t about shaming yourself for what you wanted… <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/what-are-responsive-spontaneous-desire-styles"">it’s about refining your desires</a>. Who turns you on intellectually, spiritually, creatively? That’s your real type. And no, they don’t have to be perfect, just emotionally literate and occasionally funny.<br /><br />Speaking of funny… Mercury’s got jokes now. As of October 29th, Mercury enters Sagittarius and turns your everyday life into a sitcom. You’ll find humor in the absurdity of routines, and honestly? It’s medicine. Your health, work, or to-do list may have felt heavy under Mercury in Scorpio, but now you’re allowed to laugh at the chaos. Expect random inspiration to hit while brushing your teeth or running errands. Talk to your coworkers like they’re your podcast co-hosts. Say the weird joke. Eat the protein bar. Mercury in this part of your chart is a reminder: healing isn’t always solemn — sometimes it’s hilarious.</p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, your power doesn’t need an audience — but that hasn’t stopped you from delivering a performance anyway. Mars is in its final stretch through your home, family, and foundations sector, and even if you didn’t mean to stir things up… you did. But here’s the twist: it was necessary. Since September 22nd, you’ve been privately unpacking your relationship with roots, rest, and responsibility. Some Leos have moved, redecorated, cut ties, or cried in the bathtub — all valid. Now as Mars approaches 29°, the question is: <em>What emotional habitat are you building for yourself?</em> This week is less about dramatic change and more about internal integration. You’ve grown, but have you <em>noticed</em> how differently you respond to old triggers? That’s your Mars work, right there.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Mercury enters your joy sector like a chaotic but loveable bestie. Starting October 29th, Mercury in Sag lights up your romance, play, and passion zone. Translation: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/flirty-text-messages-examples"">your texts might get flirty</a>, your jokes land louder, and you may be tempted to post a thirst trap just to feel something. Mercury in Sag wants you to remember what it’s like to fall in love with your own damn mind — and maybe someone else’s too. Say yes to the spontaneous invite. Go on that “just for fun” date. Make something dumb and beautiful. You’re in your comedic rom-com era, and even if it gets messy, it’ll be entertaining as hell.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, you’re not here to be a spreadsheet… you’re here to be the whole story. Mars in Scorpio has spent the past six weeks in your communication and expression sector, and it’s been a <em>lot</em>. You’ve probably had to have difficult conversations, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/communication-style-mercury-sign-meaning-astrology"">revisit the way you communicate boundaries</a>, or even learn how to stop over-explaining when someone clearly isn’t listening. But now, as Mars prepares to exit Scorpio next week, you’re being asked to <em>trust your voice</em>. Not the polished, PR-ready version — the messy, tender, weirdly specific one. That’s the one that hits. This week, stop editing yourself in real-time. Mars has taught you that speaking up doesn’t always mean yelling… sometimes it means whispering the truth and letting it echo.<br /><br />Now Mercury, your ruling planet, is in full Sagittarian chaos. On October 29th, Mercury enters your home and emotional roots sector, and let’s just say… your inner child is taking the wheel. Expect random family stories to surface, nostalgia to hit during a random song, and for your jokes to get more dark-humor-meets-toddler-energy. You might also feel inspired to say things to family members (chosen or blood) that you’ve held in too long. Mercury here can heal old wounds — but only if you’re willing to talk about the awkward stuff. Say it clumsily if you must. Say it while laughing. Just don’t swallow it anymore.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, you’ve spent enough time calculating your worth… now it’s time to feel it. Mars is finishing its journey through your money and values zone, and chances are your relationship with resources — physical <em>and</em> energetic — has gone through a few plot twists. Maybe you’ve been investing more, spending less, or just noticing where your energy leaks. Mars in Scorpio doesn’t do surface-level; it wants you to understand your <em>emotional</em> relationship to currency. What’s your price for peace? What are you no longer willing to sell out for? This week is about remembering that your value doesn’t require validation. Let the final flare of Mars give you permission to invest in yourself like you’d invest in your dream. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Mercury’s entering your chatty, curious, slightly unhinged phase. On October 29th, the planet of communication enters your learning and local community zone. Expect a surge of texts, new ideas, and the occasional accidental overshare on IG stories. You’re talking faster, thinking bigger, and possibly planning three projects at once. But don’t forget: not everything needs to be monetized or turned into a brand. Mercury in Sag is here to help you <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/03/9602100/online-learning-websites-classes"">rediscover the joy of learning something</a> <em>just because</em>. Be curious, not calculating. Read a weird book. Ask a question you already know the answer to. Let wonder replace your inner critic, just for a while.</p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, you’ve burned it all down and you’ve rebuilt it from scratch. Now this week, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">your mission is to breathe</a>. Mars, your traditional ruler, has been in your sign for the past five weeks — and it’s been both a revival and a reckoning. You may have felt hyper-aware of your desires, more impulsive than usual, and somehow both exhausted and energized. As Mars prepares to exit your sign and enter Sagittarius on November 4th, you’re entering a phase of integration. What did this version of you fight for? What did it finally walk away from? This isn’t about constant transformation anymore — it’s about ownership. Mars at the final degrees of Scorpio is like the silent samurai: calm, dangerous, and done with drama. You’ve grown in ways you don’t need to prove. Trust that your actions speak loud enough now.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Mercury’s ready to spend your money or make you laugh about it. On October 29th, Mercury exits your sign and enters your income and values zone. Suddenly, your inner voice shifts from existential philosopher to impulsive travel agent. Expect a mix of financial epiphanies and random purchases — a tarot deck here, a pair of platform boots there. But deeper than that, you’re learning to speak about your worth more directly. Mercury in Sag gives you the gift of comedic timing and financial clarity… use both. Talk about your rates. Joke about capitalism.

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You’re already feeling the buzz, Sagittarius — Mercury enters your sign this week (on the 29th), and suddenly your inner monologue sounds like a TED Talk, stand-up set, and motivational speech all in one. But before you go launching into a thousand new projects, take a moment to reflect on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">the final full week of Mars in Scorpio</a> lighting up your spiritual sector. How have your subconscious patterns, intuitive nudges, and quiet obsessions shaped your motivations lately? This Mars transit has pulled you deep into your own psyche — not to make you spiral, but to help you break through. Notice what fears you’ve confronted, what secrets have surfaced, and what taboos you’re learning to reclaim. There’s strength in your shadows.<br /><br />With Mercury in your sign and a full moon in Taurus coming up next week, you’re entering a period where your words have weight — and your jokes could accidentally become spells. Use your voice with care. You might be more impulsive, excitable, or brutally honest now, and while that’s part of your charm, Sagittarius, don’t use it as a shield. Be curious rather than combative. The best breakthroughs this week come when you speak your truth <em>and</em> stay open to being surprised by others’.</p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, if you’ve been lowkey exhausted the past few weeks, Mars in Scorpio may be to blame — but also, thank. As this transit wraps up, you’re getting one last push to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ending-friendship-emotional-wellbeing"">reassess the dynamics of your friendships</a>, community, and long-term goals. Maybe someone in your circle showed their true colors, or maybe you realized you’ve outgrown certain group projects. Mars has been pruning your social garden, Capricorn, and now you get to decide what, and who, is worth watering. Make space for the relationships that feel reciprocal, collaborative, and inspiring.<br /><br />Mercury’s shift into Sagittarius on October 29 helps you loosen up and laugh again. This transit lands in your house of closure and healing, so your humor may lean toward the dry, surreal, or even absurd… but it’s cathartic. You might find yourself journaling more, reconnecting with spirituality, or speaking to a therapist (or your dream journal) with newfound honesty. Don’t underestimate the power of being funny <em>and</em> vulnerable. Your dreams may be extra vivid now, so keep track of them. They’re sending you clues. </p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You’re wrapping up a powerful chapter in your career life, Aquarius, as Mars in Scorpio spends its final days in your public image sector. Since September, this has been a time of bold moves, boundary-setting, and behind-the-scenes ambition. Maybe you’ve been wrestling with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-be-successful"">what “success” even means to you</a>, and whether it still fits the version of you you’re becoming. This week, instead of forcing momentum, try to integrate the lessons you’ve already learned. What motivates you to create? Who do you want to impact? Let your intuition be the driver now, not your ego.<br /><br />When Mercury moves into fellow fire sign Sagittarius on the 29th, your social life lights up with new connections, ideas, and invitations. You’re thinking big picture, brainstorming wild solutions, and probably texting five group chats at once. Let yourself flirt with possibility. This is the week to say yes to spontaneous convos, brainstorms, or even signing up for an online class you forgot you bookmarked. Some of the best collaborations ahead will come from unexpected DMs and late-night debates with your fellow weirdos. Say what you believe, then evolve it in real time.</p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, Mars, Planet of Action, has spent the last month stirring your desire for truth, travel, and transformation — and now, as it prepares to exit Scorpio next week, you get a final chance to process what it’s really taught you. Maybe you’ve been craving adventure, questioning old belief systems, or feeling itchy in your comfort zone. But before you jet off or burn it all down, Pisces, take stock. What ideas or philosophies have truly sustained you? Where have you gotten lost in the sauce of someone else’s worldview, and where are you ready to claim your own? This final week is a portal for recalibration.<br /><br />With Mercury entering Sagittarius on October 29, your career house lights up, and suddenly everyone wants a piece of you. Your words hold power now, so use them intentionally. Whether you’re pitching yourself, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/resume-tips"">updating your résumé</a>, or just posting something meaningful online, trust that the right people are listening. And don’t be afraid to bring your whole self — messy, mystical, hilarious — to the table. You’re allowed to be multidimensional (you are a Mutable Water sign after all). The more you let people see the real you, the more aligned opportunities will flow.</p>

Can you handle what's about to happen in the next few hours? Probably. But can you handle it on your <em>own? </em>Probably not. At least not when it comes to the<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/best-horror-movies""> scariest movies</a> of all time.<br /><br />In our opinion, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/09/11534610/angelica-ross-emma-roberts-black-trans-women-hollywood"">horror movies</a> are best consumed as a group activity. Go to the theaters in packs. Jolt at <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-horror-films-movies-shows"">the jump scares</a>. Emerge with your heart beating a <em>bit </em>too fast. Pretend, for a while, that you won't have to face the darkness alone. Inevitably, of course, you will. At some point after the movie, you'll separate from your friends and find yourself alone in your bedroom to sleep. Scenes from the movie might nip at your memory, reminding you of its<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/01/11255896/m3gan-movie-fashion-costume-design""> creepiest moments</a> and that the horrors might just exist outside of the movie theater, too. That's when the fun of the horror movie <em>really</em> begins.<br /><br />So, if you’re looking for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/04/147031/best-netflix-horror-movies"">a spooky flick to watch</a> with friends and then keep you up all night, here are our picks for the 30 scariest movies ever — if you dare.<figure><figcaption><h2><em>Sinners (2025)</em></h2>From Ryan Coogler (the visionary behind <em>Black Panther </em>and <em>Creed</em>) and starring Michael B. Jordan, <em>Sinners</em> is about twin brothers Smoke and Stack (bth played by Jordan) who are trying to leave their troubled lives behind by returning to their hometown, but they discover that an even greater evil is waiting to welcome them back. As the tagline goes: “You keep dancing with the devil, one day he’s gonna follow you home.” Also starring Wunmi Mosaku,  Hailee Steinfeld, Jack O’Connell, Jayme Lawson, Omar Benson Miller and Delroy Lindo. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Weapons (2025)</em></h2>Written and directed by <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1199107/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Zach Cregger</a>, <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/08/11926872/weapons-movie-julia-garner-review-spoilers"">Weapons</a></em> focuses on the disappearance of nearly an entire classroom except for one boy, Alex (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9816029/?ref_=fn_all_nme_1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cary Christopher</a>). When parents review the security footage in their homes, they realize that all of the missing kids woke up and ran out the door into the darkness at 2:17am on the same night. With a community searching for answers, fingers point to their teacher Justine (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/juliagarnerofficial/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Julia Garner</a>) as the culprit responsible for a mystery local police can’t even begin to solve. And as you watch, you’ll be searching for answers, too. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Nosferatu</em></h2>A Dracula tale, Robert Eggers’ <em>Nosferatu</em> is tackles the age-old story of an obsession between a haunted young woman (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lilyrose_depp/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lily-Rose Depp)</a> and the terrifying vampire (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/billskarsgard_/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bill Skarsgård</a>) infatuated with her. As it does, horror unfolds.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Fresh (2022)</em></h2>Like most good horror movies, <em>Fresh</em> starts like a fairytale: a woman named Noa (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/where-the-crawdads-sing-movie-interview"">Daisy Edgar Jones</a>) quitting dating apps and subsequently meets the supposedly perfect man, Steve (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2021/04/10427343/sebastian-stan-denise-gough-sex-scenes-monday-movie-interview"">Sebastian Stan</a>). When she accepts his invitation to a romantic weekend getaway, she finds out their love story isn't the happily ever after she was hoping for: her new man has been hiding some, ahem, unusual appetites.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Longlegs</em> (2024)<br /></h2><br />A little bit goofy and a whole lot of scary, <em>Longlegs</em> follows FBI agent Lee Harker (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2140860/"">Maika Monroe</a>) as she takes on the trials and tribulations of an unsolved serial killer case. Things take a twisted turn when she encounters a connection to the killer and has to race against time (almost as fast as your beating heart) before he mercilessly claims another family as victims.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Talk To Me </em>(2023) </h2><br />Perhaps the best horror movie to come out of Australia since <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2321549/""><em>The Babadook</em></a><em> </em>(more on that one later), <em>Talk To Me </em>combines A24 film style with a skin-crawlingly twisted story. The premise is that a group of childhood friends discover an embalmed hand that lets them communicate with spirits, which they then turn into a thrilling party game. However, things take a dark turn when the high-stakes game goes too far.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Witch </em>(2015)</h2><br />The debut film by now-notable horror director <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3211470/"">Robert Eggers</a>, <em>The Witch</em> tells the story of a family in 1600s New England whose youngest son suddenly disappears. Since the eldest daughter, Thomasin (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-anya-taylor-joy-movies-tv-shows"">Anya Taylor-Joy</a>), was the last person with the baby, the family blames her and suspicions<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/modern-witch-tarot-deck-reviews""> of witchcraft</a> begin to swirl. Slowly, paranoia ensues and the family unravels.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Midsommar</em> (2019)</h2><br />From the horror genius mind of Ari Aster, <em>Midsommar</em> follows the story of Dani (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/09/11108027/florence-pugh-makeup-venice-film-festival"">Florence Pugh</a>) as she journeys to a rural village in Sweden with her boyfriend and his friends. What starts off as a picturesque trip to take part in a midsummer festival turns into a freaky hellscape run by a violent cult. Perhaps the most unsettling part of this movie is the mix of the sunny, idyllic setting with truly terrifying, dark scenes.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Rosemary’s Baby</em> (1968)</h2><br /><br />Rosemary (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001201/"">Mia Farrow</a>), a pregnant newlywed living in a Manhattan brownstone, has a feeling that something isn't right with her baby — or with her neighbors. Though she's told not to take those suspicions seriously by the more ""rational"" people in her life, aka her husband (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001023/"">John Cassavetes</a>), Rosemary should listen to her gut, call her mom, and get out of that apartment. Alas. Instead, she's impregnated by the devil, and her baby is to be used in a Satanic ritual. <em>Rosemary's Baby </em>conjures up an unforgettable atmosphere of second-guessing that bleeds into outright fear.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Psycho</em> (1960)</h2><br />After stealing money from her boss, Marion Crane (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001463/"">Janet Leigh</a>) leaves town. After a day of traveling, she seeks refuge in a decrepit motel — but danger she encounters at this hotel is far worse than law enforcement. Marion never could've guessed the secrets the hotel's innocuous-seeming manager, Norman Bates (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000578/"">Anthony Perkins</a>), was hiding. <em>Psycho </em>manages to be one of the scariest movies ever without <em>any </em>gore whatsoever. Instead, the movie will make you question where all of your casual decisions might be leading you.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Don't Look Now</em> (1973)</h2><br />John Baxter (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000661/"">Donald Sutherland</a>) and his wife Laura (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001046/"">Julie Christie</a>) are devastated when their daughter dies. In the aftermath, John takes a job restoring a church in Venice. There, they meet two strange old women who claim to see their daughter. <em>Don't Look Now </em>is a stunning work of psychological horror adapted from a story by Daphne du Maurier, the author of <em>Rebecca</em>. It's light on gore but big on scares.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Hush</em> (2016) </h2><em>Hush </em>is a creative entry into the horror genre. The movie follows an intense cat-and-mouse game between a stalker and his unwilling victim. Maddie (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2318089/"">Kate Siegel</a>) is a deaf author who lives alone. <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0302330/"">John Gallagher Jr.</a> is the masked killer who thinks she's going to be an easy target. He's wrong.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Exorcist </em>(1973)</h2><br />Good luck getting Regan's (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000304/"">Linda Blair</a>) ravings out of your mind after seeing <em>The Exorcist</em>. Over the course of this horror classic, Regan goes from being a sweet elementary-schooler to a foul-mouth demon. And no, puberty isn't to blame. The devil is.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>28 Days Later </em>(2002)</h2><br />What would<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/01/11257325/the-last-of-us-hbo-premiere-everything-to-know""> the zombie apocalypse</a> actually look like? How would it reshape the world? After a virus contaminates the population, civilization quickly crumbles. <em>28 Days Later </em>is a movie about the flimsiness of our institutions, and how susceptible we are to something like the rage virus. Oh, and it stars a young <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0614165/"">Cillian Murphy</a>.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>It Follows </em>(2014)</h2><br /><br />So many horror movies are structured around the idea that <em>something </em>is coming for the main characters. <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/"">In <em>Alien</em>,</a> it's the xenomorph. In <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087800/""><em>A</em> <em>Nightmare on Elm Street</em></a>, it's Freddy Krueger. <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3235888/""><em>It Follows</em></a><em> </em>cleverly updates the tropes seen in these movies. After Jay (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2140860/"">Maika Monroe</a>) sleeps with her boyfriend Hugh (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1621032/"">Jake Weary</a>) for the first time, she contracts a terrible STD: Death is following her, until she passes it on to someone else. If it kills Jay, it kills everyone who came before her, too.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Omen </em>(1976)</h2><br />Ever babysit a kid and just<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/10/11159487/black-latina-ghost-hunters""> get the shivers</a>? <em>The Omen</em> will confirm that, indeed, some children are just bad eggs — and of that set, Damien (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0827032/"">Harvey Spencer Stephens</a>) is the baddest egg of all. After Katherine (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001665/"">Lee Remick</a>) gives birth to a stillborn baby boy, her husband Robert (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000060/"">Gregory Peck</a>) and doctor conspire to replace him with an orphan — and not tell Katherine. Soon, everyone around baby Damien starts dying. That’s right: Robert may have accidentally adopted the antichrist.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> (1974)</h2><br /><br />What begins as a road trip turns into a nightmare after Sally (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0122782/"">Marilyn Burns</a>), her brother, and two of their friends encounter a group of outcasts living in a barn — one of whom is a serial killer. In this movie, you can catch Leatherface at the beginning of his long franchise life. Horrifyingly, <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> is based on the true story of Ed Gein, who made masks from the skins of his victims.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Conjuring </em>(2013)</h2><br /><br />Taking place in Rhode Island in the ‘70s, <em>The Conjuring</em> details the events of real-life paranormal investigators and demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren as they are called upon to investigate a family being terrorized in their new<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/10/126422/haunted-houses-vacation-rentals""> haunted house</a>. Plus, this movie is a gateway into the entire <em>Conjuring </em>film universe, which includes <em>Annabelle</em>, <em>The Nun</em> and <em>The Conjuring</em> sequels, all of which are based on the Warrens' supposed exploits.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Hereditary</em> (2018)</h2><br /><br />If only a movie could come with a seatbelt. In the case of <em>Hereditary</em>, we’d want one. The movie begins with the death of the Graham family matriarch. As the family grieves, they’re haunted by a malevolent presence. Get ready for a jolting, shocking ride. This is the aforementioned Ari Aster’s first film — and it will certainly keep you up at night.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Carrie</em> (1976)</h2><br /><br /><em>Carrie </em>takes the inherent horrors of high school seriously. For Carrie (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000651/"">Sissy Spacek</a>), high school is a waking nightmare. She’s relentlessly bullied at school. At home, her uber-religious mother punishes her constantly. Carrie’s head is a swirling mess of repression. Eventually, she finds release at the high school prom, where she’s christened Prom Queen in an outpouring of pig’s blood. The movie culminates in one of the most memorable, horrifying climaxes in cinematic history.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Halloween</em> (1978)</h2><br /><br />The original <em>Halloween</em>, released 50 years ago, is a stalwart in the slasher genre. Michael Myers, recently freed from a mental institution, runs amok in the town of Haddonfield, IL targeting teenagers especially. Laurie (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000130/"">Jamie Lee Curtis</a>) is a babysitter who manages to outsmart (or maybe just outrun) him. Watch it so you can have a whole <em>Halloween</em> marathon that includes the final entry from 2022 in the recent reboot trilogy, which takes place when Laurie is older, waiting for the return of her tormentor. The final girl lives on.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Alien</em> (1979)</h2><br />The game: survival. The players: the hapless human crew of the spaceship Nostromo and the xenomorph, a slimy alien with rows of fangs for teeth. <em>Alien </em>is a gore-fest, reminding us that death could (literally) be around any corner. The movie also introduced one of the most iconic woman heroes and final girls of all time: Ellen Ripley (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000244/"">Sigourney Weaver</a>).<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Shining</em> (1980)</h2><br /><br />Where art house cinema meets horror meets psychological thriller, that’s where you’ll find <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000040/"">Stanley Kubrick’s</a> <em>The Shining. </em>Writer Jack Torrance (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000197/"">Jack Nicholson</a>) relocates his wife Wendy (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001167/"">Shelley Duvall</a>) and his psychic son, Danny (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0515950/"">Danny Lloyd</a>), to Colorado’s Overlook Hotel for the winter. They think they’re alone, but they're not. Ghosts populate the Overlook Hotel. And soon, so does madness.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Get Out</em> (2017)</h2><br /><a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1443502/"">Jordan Peele's</a> Oscar-nominated directorial debut is certainly scary because of the jump scares and unexpected twists. But what sets <em>Get Out </em>apart from every other horror movie is its incisive — and terrifying — commentary about race in America. Chris (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2257207/"">Daniel Kaluuya</a>) goes with his white girlfriend, Rose (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4129745/"">Alison Williams</a>), to meet her family in their upstate mansion. He can't shake the feeling that something's <em>off </em>with her family. He's incredibly right. If you like Peele’s work, then you also need to watch <em>Us</em> (2019) and<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/07/11058789/jordan-peele-nope-ending-explainer""> <em>Nope</em> (2022)</a>.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Paranormal Activity</em> (2007)</h2><br /><br />By introducing the concept of ""found footage,"" <em>The Blair Witch Project </em>reshaped the entire horror movie genre. <em>Paranormal Activity </em>brought the found footage feeling right to your living room. CCTV catches each creepy haunting that preys on the Sloat family in their new house.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em> (1984)</h2><br /><br />Sleep is where we go to retreat from the world. Except in <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em>, sleep is where you're most susceptible to Freddy Krueger (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000387/"">Robert Englund</a>), a demon who kills teenagers in their dreams — and then ensures their death in reality.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Silence Of The Lambs</em> (1991)</h2><br /><br />In <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em>, FBI investigators realize the only way they can catch the serial killer Buffalo Bill (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0505971/"">Ted Levine</a>) is by consulting someone who knows the killer mind intimately: Dr. Hannibal Lecter (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000164/"">Anthony Hopkins</a>), a convicted cannibalistic serial killer already locked up. Clarice Starling (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000149/"">Jodie Foster</a>) is forced to get close to the masked, smooth-talking Dr. Lecter who could — and does — eat a human as casually as he eats a lamb chop.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Ring</em> (1998)</h2><br /><br />Good luck staring at a TV set after watching<em> Ring</em>. The premise of this Japanese movie — which was later turned into the 2002 American movie <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298130/""><em>The Ring</em></a><em> </em>— is terrifying: Watch a cursed video tape, and have seven days to live, unless you make a copy of the tape and pass it on. In that case, you’ve cursed someone else. In<em> Ring</em>, the boundaries between<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/10/11788325/best-new-streaming-movies-tv-shows-october""> what we watch</a> and our fate is tied together inherently. Fortunately that’s not normally the case<em> </em>— otherwise fans of serial killer shows would be in trouble.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Orphanage </em>(2007)</h2><br /><br /><em>The Orphanage </em>is a thought-provoking and thrilling entry into <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/04/147031/best-netflix-horror-movies"">the horror genre</a> which will appeal to <em>all</em> movie buffs. At the start of the movie, Laura (Belén Rueda), her husband (Fernando Cayo), and adoptive son (Roger Princep) return to the orphanage where she was raised. She hopes to convert the orphanage into a home for disabled children. Instead, she stumbles upon the orphanage's dark history, which manifests in ghost form.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Babadook</em> (2014)</h2><br /><br />“If it's in a word, or it's in a look, you can't get rid of the Babadook.” So goes the rhyme which repeats, like an unforgettable motif, throughout this Australian movie. In <em>The Babadook</em>, a single mother (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0204583/"">Essie Davis</a>) and her son (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5231168/"">Noah Wiseman</a>) live together in an old house that is <em>already </em>scary — and then becomes <em>super </em>scary when a long-limbed monster called the Babadook makes his presence known. <em>The Babadook </em>is a chilling story about loss and trauma nestled inside a conventional horror movie format.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Blair Witch Project </em>(1999)</h2><br /><br /><em>The Blair Witch Project </em>could be the scariest movie on this list, simply because of how <em>real </em>it seems. Typically, while watching a<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/best-horror-movies""> horror movie</a>, you can rationalize some of the fears away by reminding yourself of its fictional nature. But that's harder to do when watching a movie like <em>Blair Witch</em>. The movie depicts three film students (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0931321/"">Michael Williams</a>, Joshua Leonard, and <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0231946/"">Heather Donohue</a>) who supposedly set forth to find the Blair Witch in 1994; the movie is the footage they left behind. When it premiered at Sundance in 1999, some viewers really did think it was a documentary.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Audition</em> (1999)</h2><br /><br />You haven't seen a<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/10/11138345/do-revenge-drea-camila-mendes-video""> revenge movie</a> until you've seen <em>Audition</em>. In this Japanese movie, a widowed film producer sets about finding a wife very methodically. He'll interview women for a nonexistent movie part. When he finds a properly submissive woman, he'll ask her out on a date. But he wasn't prepared for Asami (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0793402/"">Eihi Shiina</a>), the 28th auditionee of the day with a gruesome plan of her own.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Open Water </em>(2003)</h2><br /><br />Some might say that <em>Open Water </em>is the scariest movie on this list, but not because it’s a classic horror movie. A couple goes on a scuba diving expedition during a beach vacation. Then, the boat leaves them in the middle of the ocean. On the surface of the water, they panic and bicker. Beneath them, sharks start to circle. No movie will inspire more existential dread than this one, watching people face the inevitability of their death. On a final note: <em>Open Water </em>is based on a true story, which makes it all the more scary.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>IT </em>(2017)</h2><br /><br />Every 27 years, the children of Derry are preyed on by a shape-shifting force of evil who typically takes the form of a painted clown (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0803889/"">Bill Skarsgård</a>). The year IT comes back, a group of misfits called the Loser's Club decides to take the monster on. <em>IT </em>is set in a world in which no one can protect kids but themselves.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Suspiria </em>(2018)</h2><br /><br /><a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0345174/"">Luca Guadagnino's</a> remake of <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000783/"">Dario Argento's</a> classic horror film is a deeply unsettling tale of witchcraft, ballet, and violence. Warning: There is one particularly gruesome scene that some viewers found so repulsing they actually got physically ill. It involves a dancer's bones breaking as a dancer in a second room inadvertently controls her grotesque movements. If you’re prone to squeamishness, maybe steer clear of this movie. <br /><br /></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<p><em>Welcome to “</em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/whats-good""><em>What’s Good</em></a><em>,” a column where we break down what’s soothing, distracting, or just plain good in the streaming world with a “rooting for everybody Black” energy. This edition is all about </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3lgD59KrTw"">Hedda</a><em>, starring </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/03/11311288/tessa-thompson-creed-3-bianca-therapy""><em>Tessa Thompson</em></a><em> and directed by </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-marvels-movie-woke-backlash""><em>Nia DaCosta,</em></a><em> in theaters now and streaming on Prime Video on October 29. I also spoke to Thompson and DaCosta about the film below. </em></p>



<p><strong>What’s Good? </strong><em>Hedda</em> is good because <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2025-10-23/nia-dacosta-tessa-thompson-hedda-interview"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nia DaCosta</a> is great. And <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2019/04/230130/is-little-woods-realistic-interview-tessa-thompson"">Tessa Thompson</a> is even better. The DaCosta-directed adaptation of Henrik Ibsen’s classic play stars Thompson in the titular role as Hedda Gabler, an ambitious, repressed housewife still hung up on her prodigious ex-lover, Eileen (played by an enthralling <a href=""https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/nina-hoss-hedda-interview-1235156752/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nina Hoss</a>) and bored by her prosaic husband, George (a delightfully aloof and banal <a href=""https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a65454630/who-is-tom-bateman-daisy-ridley-husband/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tom Bateman</a>). Hedda’s disenchantment comes to a head at a dinner party where Eileen shows up with her new girlfriend, Thea (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/impoots/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Imogen Poots</a> playing frantic and overwrought perfectly), as she’s vying for the same job as George. Throw in Hedda’s other sometimes-lover Judge Roland Brack (a mischievous and menacing <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/nicholaspinnock/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nicolas Pinnock</a>) in the mix and you’ve got a night of mayhem and manipulation. </p>



<p>Set in 1950s England, as the party devolves into shambles — mostly orchestrated by Hedda herself — <em>Hedda</em> goes from a simmering conversation about what happens to a woman bound by her circumstances to a sexy psychological thriller about class, power, and ambition. As the events of the evening unfold, Hedda becomes more and more quietly unhinged and Thompson is so magnetic, oozing with charisma, that you can’t look away and you can’t help but root for one of the messiest women in cinematic history. I like to think of this column as my own Oscars. The Academy is going to deem their own “best of the best” come March 2026, and while Tessa Thompson’s name should definitely be on that ballot, in this space, I get to say what’s the best of the year and I am telling you — unequivocally — that <em>Hedda</em> is one of the best films and performances of the past year. Period. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Hedda is frustrating because even when you disagree with her choices on a fundamental level, you understand every single one of her motivations for being a manipulative, conniving, chaos monster. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>Who It’s Good For (spoilers ahead): </strong>I’m probably supposed to say that Hedda is good because it shows you a complex female character we haven’t seen onscreen before but I don’t think that’s true. We’ve seen many complex female characters onscreen — some were played by Thompson. What makes <em>Hedda</em> so great and unique is that the complex female character that we’re seeing is not only Black, she’s also queer, and she’s one of the most <em>infuriating</em> characters I’ve ever watched. Complimentary! Hedda is frustrating because even when you disagree with her choices on a fundamental level, you understand every single one of her motivations for being a manipulative, conniving, chaos monster. She does all of these things — like (spoiler!) burn Eileen’s manuscript — because she is handcuffed by the confines of her surroundings. In order to break free of those constraints, Hedda acts out and becomes an architect of destruction. The thing this movie says so boldly is not only is Hedda’s acting out OK, it’s fucking fun to watch. As Hedda blows up her own world and unravels the life she has carefully crafted while desperately trying to hold onto it, the audience is watching her fight for freedom. And that’s relatable to any woman, but it’s also liberating to watch a Black woman push to define herself, even if her methods are questionable. </p>



<p>The question at the center of <em>Hedda</em>, according to DaCosta, is “What does freedom look like?” she tells me over Zoom from New York, sitting beside Thompson. “Especially when it comes to how we represent ourselves, how we represent ourselves as Black women, is it freedom to limit ourselves to just these stereotypically positive traits, like being elegant or strong or noble? Is that freedom?” It’s not. I think true freedom for Black characters to be able to be <em>whatever they are</em> in all of their complicated, messy, frustrating, contradicting ways, just like human beings are, and just like their white counterparts so often get to be.</p>



<p>“I understand historically that we have to make sure that we’re not going to invite literal violence, by showing a negative portrayal of Blackness. I’m really empathetic to that attempt, but I also think it does limit us,” DaCosta continues. “For me, what’s been so important is seeing dynamic, human, Black women on screen in my life. I think that’s really what builds empathy, not making a small box for ourselves that we have to fit into. It was really exciting for me, but I also knew that people might get a little upset.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Over the course of my career, I’ve somehow gotten very, very lucky to play women that are complicated and interesting and aren’t always completely digestible or perfect. It’s just always been what I’ve been attracted to.</p><cite>tessa thompson</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>I didn’t find it upsetting to watch Hedda elegantly stomping around her party looking stunning (seriously, has anyone ever looked better onscreen than Thompson in this role?) and actively dismantling the lives of everyone around her. I found it fascinating. And because Thompson plays Hedda with nuance and depth, it never feels like her manipulation is simply incidental. Even when Hedda is at her absolute worst — like trying to convince Eileen to end her own life (diabolical!) — you can see that her judgement is clouded by self preservation, heartbreak, and desperation. It’s in those moments of inner turmoil where Hedda, and Thompson, shine. “Over the course of my career, I’ve somehow gotten very, very lucky to play women that are complicated and interesting and aren’t always completely digestible or perfect. It’s just always been what I’ve been attracted to,” Thompson says. “And I think the thing that felt particularly exciting about this piece is Ibsen, in the head of Gabler, wrote the prototypical first, way-ahead-of-her-time complicated, messy woman. I think what felt really exciting is to turn that on its head and to reimagine it and to repurpose it and to reconstruct it in all the beautiful ways that Nia was able to.” </p>



<p>If you’re familiar with Ibsen’s play, you’ll love <em>Hedda</em>. And if you’re not, you’ll be in awe of how timely the text still is, and you’ll — in spite of yourself — fall in love with a character who may or may not love herself and is intent on challenging everyone around her to face their own inner demons. There’s a method to her menace.</p>



<p><strong>How Good Is It? </strong><em>Hedda</em> is so good, I’ve seen it four times – twice at the <a href=""https://tiff.net/films/in-conversation-with-tessa-thompson-and-nia-dacosta"">Toronto International Film Festival</a> because I went to the premiere and hosted an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE1ZaBKR5IY"">In Conversation with Thompson and DaCosta</a>, and twice again to prep for our interview. Each time, I found something new to fixate on. The last time, I found myself connecting Hedda’s plight as a queer 1950s housewife without the freedom to live as she desires to the current <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/12/11161942/tiktok-black-tradwives-burnout-marriage-capitalism"">tradwife resurgence</a>. I ask DaCosta about the connection: “I find the tradwife thing super interesting because I can totally see that being a valid economic choice, considering the shit show that is our current climate, economy, world,” DaCosta says. “And also, you see it happen a lot where women choose to give up parts of their freedom so that they can feel safe, even though I don’t think that actually makes you safe.” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>How we represent ourselves as Black women, is it freedom to limit ourselves to just these stereotypically positive traits, like being elegant or strong or noble? Is that freedom?”</p><cite>nia dacosta</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“I think Hedda is someone who’s wrestling with that. Actually, she’s wrestling with [the thoughts that] these things make me safe, or they’re supposed to make me safe, but they’re also killing me,” DaCosta continues. “That battle is where so much of her frustration and her violence comes from, not just the violence she directs outwards, but also towards herself. But I think that’s so complicated for her to unpick and what we’re watching is someone unpick that in whatever way she can.”</p>



<p>As Hedda battles with herself, there’s a rage simmering underneath every smirk and every one of her bleak and destructive actions. Whether that rage makes Hedda suicidal is up for debate up until the final frame. When I ask Thompson about female rage, she says she was able to say so much about the topic through <em>Hedda</em>. “I think there is a tremendous amount of rage that gets started inside of us as humans full stop, but particularly related to moving through the world as a woman,” Thompson says. “I’ve spoken about my grandmothers on this press tour, because I started with them [in preparing for <em>Hedda</em>]. I started to imagine the rage that they must have felt that never got to be expressed. For my father’s mother, she immigrated to this country as a young woman of color in working spaces, managing the whole house. And her life revolved around her family, and she happily made that choice.”</p>



<p>“But I look at photographs of her before she immigrated, [she’s] free on a beach with her friends. I think there was a certain kind of freedom that she had before she came to America and was suddenly a Black American,” Thompson continues. “I just imagine all of the things that she must have felt, all of the private rage that she must have suppressed, and the same for my maternal grandmother. It felt like getting to play this character, to unleash that rage, maybe not in the kindest ways, as Hedda, but it felt like getting to exorcize that for all of the women in my life, for the woman I have been in the past that had secret, private rage at the violence sometimes that you can experience as a young girl moving through the world. It felt good to put it on screen and I hope that in some private ways, it can help people who see the film, and particularly women, to just engage with that. It doesn’t mean you need to cause harm because of it, but don’t deny that you might feel [rage]. Allow yourself the space.”</p>



<p>And that’s ultimately what Thompson and DaCosta have done: provided a space where female rage, complexity, and messiness can coexist. It’s work that I imagine would make Thompson’s grandmothers very proud. Often when we talk about artists on the margins — the ones who aren’t white or straight or male or all three — we talk about the past or about how much they still have to achieve, how excellent they have to be in order to be worthy enough to earn their place. Tessa Thompson and Nia DaCosta are already there, and more importantly, they do work that makes us look forward with hope and endless possibility. That’s how I felt watching <em>Hedda</em>.</p>



<p>Turning Henrik Ibsen’s play into a sensual Black, queer, romp for modern audiences was risky. But Thompson and DaCosta have proven time and time again that they take big swings. From blockbusters (both have dabbled in the Marvel universe, Thompson is the star of the <em>Creed</em> franchise and DaCosta is about to direct the next instalment of  the <em>28 Years Later</em> series), to daring adaptations, to small original ideas (they first collaborated on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/04/229875/little-woods-movie-review-lily-james-tessa-thompson""><em>Little Woods</em></a>), this director-actor duo do all the things we’re being told can’t exist in Hollywood anymore. And their latest collaboration is their best yet. Ultimately, <em>Hedda</em> is a stunning reimagining that painstakingly and purposefully builds towards an astonishing climax. It’s gorgeous and bold and just another entry into the canon of both DaCosta and Thompson’s work about complicated, brilliant, and infuriating women. </p>

And as it gets colder, think of coats made from wool, fleece, and puffer materials as well as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cape-coats-jackets-trend"">styles with scarf details</a> for extra coverage and warmth.<br /><br />To provide a little shopping inspiration, we've gathered our top picks from reader-favorite retailers like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lululemon-loungewear-loungeful-collection"">Lululemon</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-free-people-fp-movement-sets-co-ords"">Free People</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-sandy-liang-collaboration-2025"">Gap</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-damson-madder-new-arrivals"">Damson Madder</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/maeve-anthropologie-bestsellers-review"">Anthropologie</a> to cart up and elevate your fall ‘fits. <br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938219.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>When you think of “beauty sleep,” you might think of plush mattresses, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/silk-pillowcase-hair-skin-benefits"">silk pillowcases</a>, or maybe an overnight mask from your favorite K-beauty brand. And while rest is essential for staying in tip-top shape both mentally and physically, it’s also when your skin gets to work.</p>



<p>That’s right: When you’re enjoying your trip to snoozeland, that’s when your skin gets hard to work — which is what inspired Nocturnal’s hero serum.</p>



<p>“If you’re not getting the proper sleep your body needs, cortisol levels remain high, interfering with cellular activities like wound healing, and even skin hydration,” dermatologist Joshua Zeichner, MD, tells Refinery29. “This even can contribute to acne breakouts.” Founded by beauty industry veterans Katey Hassan and Daniel Kiyoi, Nocturnal’s <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/UBAGQESK/products/polar-night-renewal-serum"">Polar Night Renewal Serum</a> is smart, luxurious skincare in a bottle — and it’s definitely not your everyday night serum. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.linkby.com/UBAGQESK/products/polar-night-renewal-serum"">Polar Night Renewal Serum</a>, $178</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938218.jpg?width=910&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=455%3A512"" /></figure>



<p>Packed with peptides, niacinamide, oat-derived lipids, and evening primrose, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/UBAGQESK/products/polar-night-renewal-serum"">Polar Night</a> is made to brighten, hydrate, and address signs of aging. However, the most notable innovation IMO lies in a patent-pending delivery system — which actually matters so the potent ingredients you’re paying for get readily absorbed by your skin. But at the end of the day, all of the fancy technology in the world doesn’t matter if my skincare doesn’t yield results.</p>



<p>I may not have wrinkles and fine lines yet (I’m 32, but still get routinely asked if I’m still in college — a slight annoyance that I will one day love, I’m sure), so I can’t speak much to the fine line-reducing ability of Polar Night, but I will say that my overall bounciness and texture have vastly improved since incorporating this into my PM routine. (I even keep it on my nightstand to reapply right before bed.) In the morning, I wake up with soft, smooth skin that isn’t screaming for moisture.</p>



<p>And here’s the thing: Is it expensive? Yes. However, I always recommend investing in your serum or moisturizer (as opposed to cleansers) since they tend to be more concentrated in actives and stay on your skin for a longer period of time. The 30mL full size lasted me a few months with nightly use, and I just replaced it with a <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/UBAGQESK/products/polar-night-renewal-serum-refill?variant=43293817143484"">refill pod</a>. (Which, when the packaging is as gorgeous as Nocturnal’s, it genuinely makes me want to reuse it forever.) And since I’ve been using Polar Night, I’ve haven’t wanted to book a facial or invest in richer moisturizers since my skin is already happy and hydrated. Serums that work smarter <em>and </em>harder? Here for it.</p>

<p>We’re now in the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-fall-candles-2025-latine"">middle of fall</a>. The onset of Scorpio season lands in the depths of fall for the Northern Hemisphere. As we dive into the simmering waters of Scorpio, we’ll feel more connected to others because our hearts and minds will be open. We have the opportunity to realize our dreams and we will be lucky enough to be happy with the outcome. Read on to discover the spooky and sweet vibes that will be coming in the month ahead.<br /><br />As a fixed <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/water-signs-zodiac-traits-explained"">water sign</a>, Scorpio is known for devotion and loyalty. The scorpion, who will sting with their poisonous venom when hurt, is extremely intuitive and highly aware of their surroundings. Scorpios wear their hearts close to their chest and suss people out before letting them in. In the days ahead we are going to decide who and what is worth investing our energy into. Being cautious will lead to us being comfortable around the people we trust. </p>



<p>The decaying leaves dropping off the trees remind us of our own mortality. Scorpio is the sign of sex, death, taxes, and evolution and we will be monitoring our personal advancementł. This is a time to make the shifts that have been on our minds. The winds of change are having a profound effect on us. We hold the power to our success and joy. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/manifest-goals-2025-zodiac-signs"">Manifesting our goals</a> will be easier. Like the crops being picked, our visions will soon be a reality. With two retrogrades (Mercury and Jupiter) and a potent Super Full Harvest Moon, we’ll contemplate our next moves and reflect on the past. </p>



<p>The feeling to watch out for is jealousy. On October 24th, when the Sun squares Pluto, we may be consumed by the green-eyed monster. This feeling might be projected onto others, or we could be the victims of it. Scorpio energy can bring out our dark side. We need to make peace with shadowy emotions by embracing our inner child and recognizing these our feelings for what they are. We should love these parts of ourselves in an effort to temper and heal them. By using our innate strength and stamina, we can create a better state of being for ourselves. Be gentle and sympathetic to others and yourself as you float through the enigmatic waves of Scorpio season.</p>



<p>Key Astrological Dates For Scorpio Season: <br /><br /><strong>October 22nd:</strong> The Sun enters Scorpio, starting a month of transformation. Our emotions will get deep, urging us to commit.<br /><br /><strong>October 29th:</strong> Mercury moves into Sagittarius, making communication direct and upfront — no more mincing words.<br /><br /><strong>November 4th:</strong> Mars glides into Sagittarius, pushing us to chase our independence and embrace adventure. <br /><br /><strong>November 5th:</strong> The magical Super Full Moon in Taurus illuminates the sky and highlights our sensual desires.  </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939013.jpg?resize=150%2C150"" /></figure></div>



<p>Let me start by saying this: I am <em>not</em> a sports girl. Never have been. I danced as a kid, I work out, but anything that involves a ball and coordination? Count me out. So when <a href=""https://usapickleball.org/"">USA Pickleball </a>invited me to <a href=""https://www.sandals.com/south-coast/?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=104221446&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD4_U5AhxrctAUMq2uzoLE8kEywU5&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw6bfHBhDNARIsAIGsqLjkljtYkno35KSzZW5OFnvIzuxguWYbDOHKgW_w-WY_uOvjewusxnwaAqYXEALw_wcB"">Sandals South Coast</a> in Jamaica for World Pickleball Day, I was equally excited and terrified.</p>



<p>But after one week of sun, sweat, and intense fun, I get it. I finally understand why everyone’s obsessed with pickleball.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Sandals was named <a href=""https://www.sandals.com/pickleball/"">USA Pickleball’s Official All-Inclusive Resort,</a> and we were there to celebrate the partnership and test out their brand-new courts. From the moment we arrived, they rolled out the red carpet: new rackets, balls, and enough <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pickleball-gifts"">pickleball merch</a> to fill a carry-on. Jamaica is already my favorite island so getting to play my first-ever game in paradise was an unreal experience.</p>



<p>Before we jumped into games, our coach gave us a crash course in Pickleball 101. We started with the basics: how to hold the paddle, how to serve, how <em>not</em> to send the ball flying into another court (which I may or may not have done). My biggest struggle? Figuring out how hard to hit. My brain kept wanting to play tennis, I was reminded over and over: <em>no wrist flicks, no power swings, just a light tap.</em></p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939014.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>If I’m being honest, I was almost more excited about my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/08/11488863/pickleball-fashion-outfits"">pickleball fits </a>than the actual sport. On day one, I wore a cute tan set that immediately betrayed me. I had visible sweat marks all over my body and let’s just say I was no longer the girl with the cute fit on the court. I was drenched in sweat, and my cute court outfit was a distant memory. But by day two, I came back strong in a white cropped tee, white tennis skirt, bucket hat, and sunnies. Looking cute on the court was an instant confidence boost. I actually started getting the hang of it.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939015.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>By the end of the week, I was into it — like, “maybe I’ll join a pickleball league” level of into it. It’s social, easy to learn, and doesn’t leave you feeling like you just survived bootcamp. I totally get why everyone from your parents to your favorite celebs can’t stop talking about it.</p>



<p>I also have to give Sandals its flowers. I’m usually not an all-inclusive resort girl, but this trip changed my mind. Between the food, the vibes, and the fact that they have everything you need to pick up a new hobby (paddles, balls, courts, and lessons), it’s the perfect setup for both chill and play.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939016.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>I went to Jamaica thinking I’d sip cocktails by the pool and maybe try this pickleball thing once. Instead, I got my cardio in, made new friends, and found a sport I actually like. So yeah, consider me a convert.</p>



<p>If you’ve been side-eyeing the pickleball hype like I was, take this as your sign: grab a paddle, find a court, and try it for yourself. Just… don’t wear tan.<br /></p>

<p>On the first day of her first job out of college, Olandria Carthen, aka Bama Barbie, walked in and was struck with one thought: <em>I’m the only one who looks like me. </em>Not only were there no women, but there weren’t any Black folks. </p>



<p>“In that moment in time, I had to remember: Tuskegee literally prepares you for moments like this,” says the beloved reality star, model, and aspiring entrepreneur, on the latest episode of <em>Go Off, Sis</em>, in partnership with <a href=""http://target.com"">Target</a>, about how her Historically Black College and University (HBCU) experience prepared her to face the realities of working in the elevator industry — one that’s very white and very male. “I fell into a mini post-college depression. Imagine going from an all-Black classroom to being the only Black person in the office. But I feel like Tuskegee showed me how to adapt to those types of environments and how to network. I had to remind myself: Never shrink yourself in the presence of others to make them feel more empowered.” </p>



<p>Carthen never expected to find herself in sales at an elevator company (she graduated with a degree in supply chain management), but her disarming charm — plus her Tuskegee education — set her up for success. In just a short time, she was outperforming her peers, knocking out one goal after another. It’s that same charm that not only won over her significant other — Nicolas Vansteenberghe — on arguably the most-watched reality TV show program of the summer, but also fans all over the nation. </p>



<p>“When I was on that show, I knew I was representing more than just myself — I’m representing Black women as a whole. So, going on there and knowing my self-worth, my value, and  self-acceptance truly helped me navigate this space,” she says. “Knowing I have so much support from my community, or just from all women, means the world to me.”</p>



<p>Listen to the full podcast episode during which Carthen chats with Kathleen Newman-Bremang, senior content director of entertainment at Refinery29; Sandy Pierre, brand partnerships lead at Unbothered; and Claire Ateku, social producer at Unbothered about Homecoming season, how she’s handling fame, Nicolandria, and more. </p>
