<h4><em>People want the human internet back.</em></h4><figure><img alt=""AI Robot getting stuck in a Pinterest filter"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MxLTX1U9YxMB69jKuvMU1w.png"" /><figcaption>AI Robot getting stuck in a Pinterest filter</figcaption></figure><p>Pinterest’s new AI filter could be the next step in the evolution of the internet. It’s the first major platform to actually adjust to what a lot of people have been feeling. Our feeds across a broad spectrum of apps are being flooded with low-quality AI slop. The effect is a degradation of trust and an increasing desire to have more control over what we actually see. Pinterest’s move is the first real signal that platforms are recognizing there’s a growing problem instead of pretending that AI generated content and design is the future.</p><p>While I’m not proud to say it, I do occasionally scroll TikTok to kill a few brain cells and a few minutes in my day. My partner also sends me TikToks which she says is her love language, which I in turn use to justify the habit. But these days I’m seeing a trend, there is a <em>stark</em> increase in comments trying to figure out whether a video is AI. We’re literally becoming reality police in the comments of these feeds. Sometimes it’s obvious, there’s that monotoned, programmatically friendly voice playing over a grainy, intentionally retro aesthetic designed to hide AI distortions. But even when it isn’t obvious, people are suspicious. There’s a growing paranoia around what to believe and not believe when scrolling through your feeds on Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok and more.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshots of threads about whether or not a video is AI"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PDf5qkCZYMA69Z6rOqjFAg.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshots of threads about whether or not a video is AI</figcaption></figure><p>It’s a painfully predictable side effect of releasing an unregulated video-generation tool that tries its hardest to pass for reality. There are many tools racing towards that meaningless end but the most notable example is <a href=""https://sora.chatgpt.com/"">Sora</a>. There’s the famous <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9O-8kAnBL2s"">bouncing bunnies video</a> or the progressive pastor video, that went mainstream and gave Sora some early hype. But to me it seems like the hype has evaporated. I don’t know a single person who actually uses Sora.<strong> </strong>Not one. I barely know anyone who even downloaded it! And the people who did opened it once, generated something vaguely cursed, laughed nervously, and then abandoned it.</p><figure><img alt=""Images of videos of Sam Altman doing bizarre things generated by Sora"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*sCSb6GAwY_UMxcBA.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.digit.in/news/apps/openais-sora-app-is-already-flooded-with-disturbing-sam-altman-deepfakes.html"">Images of videos of Sam Altman doing bizarre things generated by Sora</a></figcaption></figure><p>To me it’s unsurprising, as it seemed like the main use case for downloading the app was making creepy videos of <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-openai-sora-app-ai-videos-2025-10"">Sam Altman being mocked</a> in increasingly bizarre and slightly more humiliating situations. Along with a string of racially insensitive videos of MLK making fake speeches, which were eventually disallowed after the very busy ethicist of open <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0g79xevxo"">AI Olivia Gambelin told the BBC OpenAI that limiting further use of Dr King’s image was “a good step forward”</a>. Not only were there weird historical recontextualized videos but also blatant copyright infringements of famous characters. Which we all know is a favourite of OpenAI. Videos on Sora are considered a “success” when they reach escape velocity and seep into mainstream content, which is a strange metric for anything, let alone for a CEO who keeps insisting this tech is “inevitable.”</p><p>But all of this “inevitability” talk from AI tech CEOs is starting to wear thin. Sure, we exist within certain systems. Yes, capital moves the way capital moves. But companies only have power because users hand it to them. When people walk away and engagement drops the inevitability story starts to look flimsy.</p><p>It’s been a awhile now since the first big wave of AI models started generating shockingly polished visuals. And I’ll be honest: sometimes the results are impressive! But my standards for AI are different from my standards for humans. There is still a huge amount of rich, deeply human art being made every day as well as a huge historical trove to dig through that is fundamentally more interesting because it comes from people with taste and lived experience.</p><p>Also the hard truth for AI generated content is that the people who can make beautiful things already are the ones best positioned to make beautiful AI-assisted things. And what are their incentives? Across the board creatives are getting fired because of the threat of AI replacement, why would they be the first to hop onboard to support a tool that’s literally trying to take their jobs. Right now it seems like lot of AI content online comes from people with no creative background dumping average outputs into the feed. People are trying their hand at it, making something new from nothing, and while I admire the spirit in that the harsh truth is it adds almost nothing.</p><p>It turns out making something good that people care about is extremely hard. And making something great is harder still. Great work in my view is inherently collaborative, political, relational. It requires conflict, iteration, and concession. You can’t flatten all of that into a prompt without losing what makes it resonate. Most recently <a href=""https://www.vice.com/en/article/openai-is-getting-into-the-movie-business-with-critterz/"">OpenAI announced that they would be making an AI first movie called Critterz for under 30 million</a> as an attempt to try and show the power of AI in film/animation production. But it does beg the question, why is it that OpenAI has to front the cash here? Maybe it’s because independent filmmakers aren’t interested in leveraging this tool? If it was truly a great tool for filmmakers, we would already be hearing about the new voices breaking through the cultural marketplace signalling the importance of this new medium. It ain’t happening!</p><figure><img alt=""Image of AI generated characters from upcoming OpenAI film Critterz"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JauRQvulDh1F49f4x_DiFQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.vice.com/en/article/openai-is-getting-into-the-movie-business-with-critterz/"">Image of AI generated characters from upcoming OpenAI film Critterz</a></figcaption></figure><p>Oftentimes when I tell this to AI boosters there’s this pushback that it’s only getting better and better, and while yes the fidelity and realism is increasing, I have yet to feel the rumblings of a creative AI revolution. I firmly believe you cannot collapse a lifetime of discipline and taste into a few paragraphs of prompting. You can’t try and remove collaboration and expect a better product. Yes, I’ve seen beautiful AI imagery, but they are the exceptions, not the rule. And more importantly: no one is asking for more of it, in fact they’re asking <strong>for less</strong>.</p><p>When people identify a video as AI, it’s usually to warn others not to trust it. That alone tells you what demand actually looks like. Most social platforms exist on human-generated content and I think the flood of AI slop is not likely to increase engagement. We all buy into this story that AI will optimize for our attention, stimulating the exact parts of our brain to create dopamine zombies and while I don’t deny that’s certainly possible, I do think that it’s actually quite unlikely. There is still no comparison between human content and AI content from a quality perspective.</p><p>Pinterest’s new filter lets users reduce or outright hide AI-generated content. TikTok is now testing a similar feature. And I know I’ll be turning it on the second it becomes available. No one begged for this influx of AI content. It doesn’t solve a problem that actually existed or if it does, I certainly can’t put a finger on it. It’s a novel toy that has overwhelmed entire corners of the internet, suffocating feeds and making us all paranoid and platforms are finally starting to admit it. While they’ll never say “our feeds were drowning in AI nonsense and users hated it.” features speak louder than words. When Pinterest gives you the option to filter out AI, and <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/tiktok-now-lets-you-choose-how-much-ai-generated-content-you-want-to-see/"">TikTok rushes to pilot something similar</a>, the message is clear: <strong>people want the human internet back.</strong></p><p>I have hope that creativity online won’t be defined by who has the most generative models pumping out piles of content. The novelty of AI is already wearing off and the fatigue is very very real. If platforms want engagement, if they want trust or if they want actual culture to keep happening on their watch, they’re going to have to give us control over our feeds, including the ability to filter out, reduce, or completely remove AI-generated content.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3e832e8ad0d0"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-internet-needs-an-ai-off-switch-3e832e8ad0d0"">The internet needs an AI off switch</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

She grew up surrounded by tutors, books and expectations that her intellect would remain a private accomplishment. When she took to history, philosophy and mathematics with a seriousness that made her parents uneasy, well, that wasn’t the goal they were going for. Knowledge, in their view, was for refinement (or so they’d hoped).</p><p>By her late teens, she had begun pushing against the edges of what society considered acceptable for someone of her background. Nursing, at the time, was not an esteemed profession. It was closer to domestic labor, associated with poverty, poor training and conditions that respectable families wanted nothing to do with. The thought of Florence entering that world was, to her parents, pretty unthinkable.</p><p>Beyond her house, Europe was shifting.</p><p>The British Army was expanding its presence abroad. Hospitals weren’t prepared for the scale or severity of the injuries they received. Medical infrastructure was inconsistent, oversight was minimal, and record-keeping existed but didn’t translate into updated policy or changes in care.</p><figure><img alt=""A detailed nineteenth-century illustration of the Battle of Balaklava showing chaotic close-quarters fighting between cavalry and artillery units.

A damaged cannon sits in the foreground beside wounded men on the ground, highlighting the intensity and confusion of the scene."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*epha6k7rC1KcB8iN8kl-Gw.png"" /><figcaption>Battle of Balaklava — Encyclopædia Britannica</figcaption></figure><p>When the <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/event/Crimean-War"">Crimean War</a> began in 1853, Britain assumed its existing systems would be enough. They weren’t. Reports of catastrophic conditions reached London. Overcrowded wards, contaminated water, shortages of supplies, and mortality rates that dwarfed expectations. Public pressure mounted, and the government needed a response that looked decisive.</p><p>Nightingale was asked to lead a team of nurses to the military hospital in Scutari.</p><p>She accepted, arriving to find a system overwhelmed not only by the war, but by a number of hard to overcome assumptions.</p><p>This is where most accounts of Florence Nightingale begin to lean on the familiar imagery. The lamp, the night rounds, the comforting presence in a place defined by suffering.</p><p>While that version is true enough to persist, it leaves out the part that gives her work its lasting impression, and why it’s the subject of this week’s unquoted.</p><p>The moment she stepped into Scutari, she realized the crisis was much more than medical.</p><p>She had entered an information crisis.</p><p>The hospital produced records, but the records concealed more than they revealed. Deaths were counted, but not categorized. Conditions were noted, but not analyzed. The data existed, but it carried no structure that could lead anyone toward responsibility.</p><p>And this is where the story takes a turn.</p><p><strong>The Florence Nightingale we’re here for is the woman who recognized that the health of an institution depends on the clarity of the information that shapes its decisions.</strong></p><h3>No decision strategy = hope</h3><p>When Nightingale began working through records at Scutari, her goal was to understand how a hospital this large could operate with so many people and have so little sense of direction. Ledgers were full (supplies, patient counts, daily notes) but nothing in them hinted at anything actionable. The information described activities being completed, but not anything about that activity’s implication.</p><p>Over time, this problem persisted. Reports were produced because that was the routine. No one had agreed on what those reports were meant to surface, which scenarios mattered, which changes signaled risk, or which patterns required action. Without that understanding, documentation became a ritual — evidence that work had occurred, not evidence that anything had been understood.</p><p>This pushed Nightingale to stop reading the reports as documentation and start reading them as evidence of how little the institution understood itself. The hospital was active… busy, even… but that activity had no correlation.</p><p>Here’s what’s interesting. Decisions weren’t necessarily being avoided. People in power didn’t know what decisions they’d make if the right information presented itself. Their entire operation was basing itself on activity, optimism and ‘God’s will’ (which is a form of fate that requires no responsibility because it assumes none is possible).</p><p>Nightingale knew the only way forward was to be clear about the goal and then to look for the signals that would tell her whether that goal was getting closer or slipping further away. If the aim was fewer deaths, then she needed to understand what conditions made death more likely, and which of those conditions could be influenced by decisions inside the hospital. That meant defining the kind of evidence that would force a change in course, and then arranging the information so those inflection points (signals) could be seen.</p><p>She worked through the records with that question in mind. Not “what happened?” but “what would have made us act sooner?” Once she separated preventable deaths from battle wounds, organized the accounts in intervals that revealed trends, and drew distinctions that had never been documented with any seriousness, the crisis took on a shape the institution couldn’t look past. The patterns had been buried under routine, but they were unmistakable.</p><figure><img alt=""A polar-area chart showing monthly mortality in the British Army from April 1854 to March 1855. Each wedge represents a month, with green areas indicating deaths from nonbattle causes and orange areas showing deaths from battle. The green segments dominate most months, especially in winter, illustrating that disease and poor conditions caused far more deaths than combat. The chart is based on Florence Nightingale’s 1858 statistical work."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XJpZCcrZmsuWeJnVEiAEYA.png"" /><figcaption>Coxcomb Chart: The English nurse Florence Nightingale was an innovator in displaying statistical data through graphs. In 1858 she devised the type depicted here, which she named Coxcomb. Like pie charts, the Coxcomb indicates frequency by relative area, but it differs in its use of fixed angles and variable radii.</figcaption></figure><p>Her work made the responsibility clear. She identified the decisions that mattered and then arranged the information around those decisions so the institution could no longer look away from its own role in the outcomes. Once the data showed the hospital was contributing to the deaths, the excuses fell apart. Their work had to change.</p><h3>Where organizations lose the plot</h3><p>The pattern Nightingale uncovered isn’t confined to a nineteenth-century hospital. We produce so much information, yet struggle with the same absence of direction. Metrics pile up. Dashboards expand. Data becomes a security blanket for activity. Ask a team what decisions any one of their numbers is meant to influence, and the answer may disappoint you. But hey, the dashboard looks compelling, right?</p><p>The problem starts early. Most organizations begin with the data they have, or the data they want, and work backward into meaning. Nightingale did the opposite. She started with the decision. She asked what needed to be understood, what changes mattered, and what signals would make a different course unavoidable.</p><p>There’s a simple discipline in that sequence.</p><p><strong>Start with decisions</strong><br />Instead of asking what additional data might be useful, ask which decisions need to be made more quickly, more confidently or with greater precision. A metric only matters if it changes a decision.</p><p><strong>Translate decisions into signals</strong><br />Once decisions are clear, the next step is to name the behaviors or conditions that would trigger movement. These signals tie to action, connecting behavior to strategy.</p><p><strong>Then map signals to the data</strong><br />Only after the signals are understood does the question of data come into play. Which information reflects those signals? Which is reliable? Which is unnecessary? This prevents teams from collecting numbers for their own sake and turns data into something closer to what Nightingale built (which was a structure that makes responsibility visible).</p><figure><img alt=""A historic photograph of Florence Nightingale standing in a dark dress with lace details, wearing a white bonnet. She faces slightly toward the camera with a calm, steady expression. The background is plain and muted, keeping the focus on her formal pose and clothing."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HktS4rjtGiH7xzqaWO0_ag.avif"" /><figcaption>London Stereoscopic Company</figcaption></figure><h3>The work most people avoid</h3><p>With every failing system, the explanation stops making sense. There’s a gap between what’s happening and what’s being said. The choice is to either declare the situation unfair and leave the responsibility where you found it… or you can step closer, notice what isn’t being noticed, and take on the work the institution isn’t prepared to do.</p><p>When Nightingale chose the second path and saw that conditions at Scutari were overwhelming, every excuse was available to her… war, fate, limited resources, the failures of others. Instead of accepting them, she studied what didn’t add up, verifying what the reports wouldn’t show. None of it was convenient. None of it was glamorous, and nearly all of it was thankless.</p><p>But as with every unquoted, that’s the work the greats take on.</p><p>Nightingale was trying to see the situation clearly enough that responsibility had somewhere to ‘land’. Her nighttime rounds weren’t mythology or symbolism. This was the work of a woman who understood that improvement begins where convenience ends.</p><p>It takes someone great to take on that kind of work.<br />She did, and it was about a lot more than a lamp.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3705e128c123"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/florence-nightingale-on-vanity-metrics-3705e128c123"">Florence Nightingale on vanity metrics</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/10716994.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>The holiday season is upon us, and with that, the arrival of the biggest shopping day of the year: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-friday"">Black Friday</a>. While we may hotly debate when it’s acceptable to blast “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” there’s one early arrival we can all agree on: Black Friday is the biggest day of the year for can’t-miss deals.</p>



<p>With the big day finally here, it’s finally time to score top-rated products you’ve been eyeing (or planning to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-gift-guides"">gift someone special</a>) for a fraction of the price. We’ve rounded up all the must-know sales for a successful — and wallet-friendly — Black Friday 2025. Read on below for our guide to the smartest savings — from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-friday-clothing-deals"">highly-coveted fashion markdowns </a>to steep cuts on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-friday-mattress-deals"">mattresses and bedding</a> — happening now.</p>



<h2>What is Black Friday?</h2>



<p>Black Friday lands the day after Thanksgiving (this year, it’s November 28). But it’s far from a single-day event. It’s now a mega-shopping marathon kicking off as early as October and continuing through early December, along with its sister sale, Cyber Monday. </p>



<h2>When do Black Friday deals start?</h2>



<p>Early Black Friday sales are already underway and will continue to ramp up throughout the month. (Remember, it’s a marathon, not a sprint!)</p>

<p>Last year, I decided I’d finally had enough of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/12/11823303/bob-haircut-trends-2025"">bob haircut</a>. Not in general — (have you seen how good it looks on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRgIcc7D_an/?hl=en"">Julianne Hough?</a>) — just on me. While hairstylists insist it’s low-maintenance <em>and</em> easy to grow out, my experience was the opposite. Every morning, I’d smooth out the bumps that popped up overnight, but straightening them gave me more <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grow-out-bob-hair-care-expert-advice"">split ends</a> than I could shake a bottle of Dream Lengths at. And so began the long slog of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-grow-long-healthy-hair"">growing my hair long again</a>.</p>



<p>Thanks to a few clever hair-growth products (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/typebea-hair-growth-products-review"">shoutout to Typebea</a>), it didn’t take too long for my hair to reach Rapunzel-level lengths, but I hadn’t given any thought to the style I’d like once it got there. My first stop was Pinterest, of course, and as if the app knew exactly what I wanted, it served up a handful of long, swishy, and intentionally <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/paris-fashion-week-haircut-trends-spring-summer-2026"">layered cuts</a>. I knew right away I had to take the photos to my hairstylist, <a href=""https://larrykinghair.com/products/steve-braithwaite?srsltid=AfmBOooaYEVmGAQYqYE6qNe8KC5C_WUVPWFzJs57Bgx24m7BJwqUDZ5b"">Steve Braithwaite</a>, at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/larrykinglondon/?hl=en"">Larry King</a> in London.</p>

<p>Braithwaite’s approach is collaborative — as all good haircuts should be. Before reaching for the scissors, he hit me with a bunch of important questions: Do I like a clean, blunt finish on the ends, or some separation? (I went with clean.) Do I want layers in the back as well as the front? (Yes, for extra volume, as a recent keratin treatment left my hair feeling flat.) Do I wear my hair up? (No, so the face-framing pieces could be as short and swishy as possible.)</p>



<p>“Let’s aim to bring the feathered vibe through the internal shape,” Braithwaite said, adding, “Not too many layers, but enough if you want a little volume — a touch of something messy and textured. It’s nice to have options.” For the face-framing layers, he wanted to make them “a bit more connected through the front,” so they “flow” into one another instead of looking disjointed or fluffy.</p>



<h2>What is the J-shape haircut?</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11945912.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11945918.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>Braithwaite started by sectioning my hair and cutting the layers at an angle to create a curve, so the first layer cupped my bottom lip, and the last ended at the center of my chest. When I took a closer look in the mirror, I noticed that those perfectly cut layers formed a soft “J” shape. If traditional layered cuts swish outward, the J-shape curves inward, gently cupping the face. It’s much looser than the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/c-shape-haircut-trend"">C-shape haircut</a> that recently took salons by storm — and lower-maintenance as a result. Of course, the J-shape cut has been dominating salons long before any of us gave it a playful name, but the visual cue certainly makes it easier to request (especially if your stylist likes to take creative license).</p>



<h2>How do you style the J-shape haircut?</h2>



<p>To style my hair, Braithwaite removed as much moisture as possible by rough-drying with a blowdryer on medium heat, then used a medium barrel brush and the dryer to smooth everything out, curving the ends under (rather than outward) to create that effortless J-shape.</p>



<p>Styling this haircut at home is even easier with a hot brush. After rough-drying my hair to about 80% dry, I section it and use my trusty <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fsmoothstyle-heated-comb-blow-dryer-brush%2F7591576"">Shark SmoothStyle Heated Comb &amp; Blow Dryer Brush</a> to smooth each piece under, creating that loose, face-framing shape. On days when I want to refresh the style, I reach for a flatiron — it’s just as good at curving each layer inward, especially when I’m in a rush. You might also like the <a href=""https://www.nordstrom.com/s/special-edition-airstrait-straightener-in-amber-silk/8482558"">Dyson Airstrait Straightener</a>, which takes hair from wet to dry quickly and easily. </p>



<p>Of course, heat protection is a must. I love <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP517767"">K18 HeatBounce Conditioning Heat Protectant</a>, which acts like a shield against high temperatures and leaves my thick hair feeling soft and manageable. </p>

<h2>How do you ask for the J-shape haircut?</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11945920.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11945921.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>Asking for the J-shape haircut is simple. Braithwaite suggests requesting “connected” layers throughout the lengths and back, with face-framing layers to finish that sweep toward the face. Thanks to the swishy finish, these layers look best when blow-dried straight and tend to suit medium to long hair. Layers like these are also a great way to take some of the weight out of thick hair like mine, but if TikTok is anything to go by, they work equally well on fine hair, as the feathering lends the illusion of volume and fullness.</p>



<p>I can safely say that the J-shape haircut is a compliment magnet. As Braithwaite finished up — working a bit of <a href=""https://www.selfridges.com/AE/en/product/larry-king-haircare-a-social-life-for-your-hair-cream-100ml_R04161273/"">A Social Life For Your Hair</a> cream through my roots and ends for extra polish — a few of the salon’s stylists came over to check out the final look and admire his handiwork. </p>



<p>Happily, I no longer dread styling my thick hair post-shower, and even if I wear it natural, I find that the relaxed J-shape layers work with my wavy texture rather than against it, giving my hair dimension and movement. It’s taken a few haircuts over the years, but with this one, I’m convinced I’ve found my forever style.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11922291.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>We’ve made it to month 12 of 12, cosmic beings, and it’s starting off with a whirlwind. The Gemini Full Moon on the 4th wants us to say everything, do everything, schedule five coffee dates, and buy twelve books we’ll only read three pages of. Gemini’s curious, chatty, and chaotic energy can be fun — or overwhelming — especially  because it’s ruled by Mercury in Scorpio, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">still in its retroshade</a> until the first week of the  month. Translation? Be careful not to spill your tea before it’s fully steeped. You don’t have to post every realization. Mind your business <em>and </em>your bandwidth. It’s okay to love variety and still be discerning. Sometimes your mind just wants to spin… That doesn’t mean you have to follow it down every rabbit hole. </p>



<p>Then, something rare and quietly miraculous starts building: on December 10th, Neptune stations direct in Pisces, joining Saturn, who just did the same a few weeks prior. This is the <em>last time in our lifetimes </em>that both of these outer planets will be moving forward together in their shared home sign. Neptune is dreams and illusions. Saturn is structure and discipline. Together, they ask: what do you want to build, and is it real enough to last, but dreamy enough to still make you weep a little? This is spiritual architecture. Soul strategy, sacred boundaries. It’s rare to feel this mystical and grounded at once. You don’t have to “figure it out.” But you <em>do </em>have to listen, especially when the guidance comes through silence, or tears, or poetry. </p>



<p>One day later, on the 11th, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mercury enters Sagittarius</a>, and things brighten. You’re encouraged to laugh again, to tell a story out loud, to say what you believe without over-explaining it. That playful Sag energy only intensifies as the sun and Mars continue moving through the sign all month, but on December 15th, Mars trades the fire for earth, entering Capricorn for a six-week stay. The vibe shifts: still motivated, still active, but more focused and grounded. And if you’re tempted to sprint toward the  finish line of the year, ask yourself why.  </p>



<p>2025 is a 9 year in numerology and we are in the Year of the Snake, and these both represent cycles of endings, surrender, and preparation. You don’t have to prove anything right now. Mars in Capricorn wants your <em>integrity</em>, not your overexertion. Ending the year strong might just mean getting enough sleep, finishing your personal projects, or walking away from what you know doesn’t align anymore. </p>



<p>The New Moon in Sagittarius arrives on December 19th, and it’s a beautiful reminder that even if this year didn’t unfold the way you expected, hope is still alive. Sagittarius teaches us how to zoom out. How to trust our own resilience. How to envision six months from now and still smile. The astro new year doesn’t begin until March 21st,  2026, so this is not a “wrap it all up” kind of month — it’s a <em>what could grow next </em>kind of moment.  </p>



<p>And when the Winter Solstice hits on December 21st, ushering in Capricorn Season, the energy pivots fully toward sustainability, maturity, and alignment. By the time Venus (Dec 24th) and Juno (Dec 29th) enter Capricorn too, many of us will be craving clarity in our relationships, our finances, our commitments. Not for control, but for peace. We want to <em>want what we’re building</em>. And that’s what the end of this year is really about. </p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, December begins with your voice returning: stronger, bolder, and maybe even  louder than you remember it. The Gemini Full Moon on December 4th floods your  communication sector with insight and closure. Conversations that have been circling for months may finally land. A pitch that sat in your notes app since June? Suddenly  sharp. A truth you’ve been avoiding? It wants out. But with Mercury still in its post retrograde shadow until December 7th, pace yourself. Just because you <em>can </em>say something doesn’t mean you have to say it all at once. This is a great time to write, teach, or start recording that podcast you’ve been procrastinating on. But be mindful not to info-dump or overshare just because the mic is hot again. Full moons are  culminations — don’t forget to pause and see what’s already come full circle before rushing into more. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, a quiet but cosmic transition is taking place behind the scenes: Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th, joining Saturn, who did the same just weeks prior, in your sector of solitude, endings, and deep spiritual healing. This is the <em>last time in your lifetime </em>these two karmic giants will be moving forward together in this realm — the basement of your subconscious, the attic of your past lives. Neptune’s been here since 2011. Saturn since 2023. That’s over a decade of spiritual unlearning, grief  processing, and karmic re-patterning finally preparing to complete. If you’ve felt foggy, withdrawn, or like you’ve been carrying the weight of something ancient without knowing why… this is why. But now, the energy is shifting. The past is still there, but it’s behind you, not breathing down your neck. You may find yourself dreaming more vividly, forgiving more deeply, and craving more solitude before big decisions. Honor that pull inward, because in a few months, Neptune enters Aries, and you’ll begin a  whole new soul cycle. For now? Breathe. Reflect. You’re almost through the tunnel. </p>



<p>Then comes December 19th’s New Moon in Sagittarius, landing in your sector of  adventure, wisdom, and future planning. Suddenly, a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/solo-trip-maldives-luxury-destination"">new long-distance trip</a>, course of  study, or leap of faith starts calling your name. And you’re so close to saying yes. But  just four days earlier, Mars, your ruling planet, enters Capricorn, launching a six-week  journey through your career and public life zone. That’s where the tension begins. This Sag new moon says <em>go wide</em>. Mars in Capricorn says <em>go deep</em>. One wants the bird’s eye view. The other wants the blueprint. You may feel pulled between freedom and responsibility, spontaneity and strategy, vision and execution. That’s okay. Don’t make it either/or. Let this be the season where you ask yourself: what’s worth building, and  what’s just distracting me from my real power?  </p>



<p>Capricorn Season kicks in on December 21st, followed by Venus and Juno joining the party, and you may feel a slow, steady pressure to be more structured, even if your Aries fire would rather blaze. This isn’t about restriction. It’s about <em>direction</em>. Don’t fight the focus. Let it guide your fire where it can actually <em>last</em>. </p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>December starts with a mirror held up to your self-worth. The Gemini Full Moon on  December 4th <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/how-to-manage-your-money"">illuminates your money</a>, value systems, and energetic exchange. If you’ve been undercharging, over-giving, or stuck in a pattern of “I’ll receive after I prove myself,” this lunation cracks something open. It’s not just about finances, it’s about where your time, presence, and power have been leaking without you noticing.  Something from the last six months might culminate now: a contract wrapping, a debt paid off, or a realization that you’re finally done tolerating breadcrumbs. But with Mercury still in Scorpio (aka your relationship zone), keep communication grounded. You don’t have to perform your boundaries — just <em>honor </em>them. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, a subtler, long-range transformation is clicking into place. Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th, joining Saturn, both moving forward in your sector of community, long-term goals, and collective belonging. This is the <em>last time in your lifetime </em>these two planets will be conjunct and direct in Pisces, in your vision zone.  Neptune has been here since 2011, asking you to reimagine what friendship, leadership, and legacy could mean for you. Saturn joined in 2023, bringing structure to  what used to be only dreams. If you’ve felt disconnected from community or unsure of your purpose within a larger movement, clarity is coming — not as a blinding flash, but a quiet alignment. You may realize that a group, platform, or network no longer fits who you’ve become. Or you may feel yourself pulled to share something vulnerable with the right people. Let your people find you. But first, make space for them by clearing what’s expired. </p>



<p>The mood shifts again on December 19th, when the Sagittarius New Moon arrives in your intimacy and shared resources zone. This lunation is about energetic merging with another person, a purpose, a source of power that stretches beyond your ego. You may feel a surge of desire, a temptation to go deeper in a connection, or a hunger to be emotionally seen in ways you’ve been shielding.  </p>



<p>But don’t rush, because just four days earlier, Mars enters Capricorn, launching a six week chapter of expansion, risk, and long-term vision — and that could add tension between staying in control vs. surrendering to something bigger. From December 21st onward, the Capricorn stellium in the skies reminds you to walk your talk. It’s not just about climbing — it’s about meaning. As the year closes, ask yourself: where do I feel brave enough to let go of control? And where am I ready to rebuild, slowly, with  devotion? Your next chapter doesn’t need to be rushed. But it <em>does </em>need to be real. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831461.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, this month starts with your name in lights, but it’s the kind of spotlight that asks: <em>are you being seen for who you really are, or who you’ve been performing as? </em>The Gemini Full Moon on December 4th lands directly in your sign, closing out a six-month identity cycle and bringing your emotions to the surface in unexpected ways. You might be smiling at brunch but crying in the car. You might suddenly feel ready to  dye your hair, quit a gig, or tell someone the truth you’ve been <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/confrontation-friendships-relationships-trust"">rehearsing in your head</a>. This lunation is emotional clarity wrapped in chaos. And with Mercury, your ruler, still in  Scorpio and moving through its post-retrograde shadow, you’re being asked to speak less from impulse, and more from embodied truth. You’ve changed. This full moon wants the real you to lead now. </p>



<p>What makes this emotional shift more potent is the subtle, oceanic current moving  beneath the surface. Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th, joining Saturn, both moving forward in your career, legacy, and public reputation zone. This is the <em>final time in your lifetime </em>that these two planetary elders will move together, direct, in Pisces. Neptune’s been here since 2011, softening your ambitions, mystifying your path, and teaching you to lead with intuition, not ego. Saturn arrived in 2023 to put  scaffolding around your dreams. And now? You’re ready to step into your role — with  less hustle, more heart. You don’t need to have the five-year plan. You just need to trust the wisdom you’ve earned. Let yourself be visible <em>without </em>needing to perform. Let the right people come find you when you’re grounded in your message. </p>



<p>Then comes a rush of new energy: the Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th activates your partnership zone, just four days after Mars enters Capricorn, igniting your intimacy and soul-merging zone for a six-week deep dive. Translation? Your love life, and your ability to share your energy, is going through a shift. If you’re in a relationship, you may crave more depth, more transparency, or more space. If you’re single, a connection could spark with someone who feels intense, but oddly familiar. And from December 21st onward, as Capricorn Season hits and Venus and Juno pile on, your relationships — romantic, financial, spiritual — become the mirror. Who are you when you’re <em>not </em>trying to impress anyone? What’s worth sharing, and what needs more boundaries? Let this be the month you return to your truth and let others meet you there. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831462.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, December begins like a dream you can’t quite remember but can’t fully shake.  The Gemini Full Moon on December 4th activates your sector of closure, healing, and  spiritual release, and suddenly, you’re ultra-sensitive to what’s <em>behind the scenes</em>. You may feel more tired than usual, more emotionally raw, more protective of your time and your nervous system. Old emotions surface through strange dreams, random  memories, or even a song that sends you spiraling. You don’t need to explain it. Just <em>feel it</em>. And then let it go. With Mercury still in Scorpio during the retroshade, this isn’t the time to spill all your secrets. It’s the time to check in with the parts of yourself that you’ve been emotionally ghosting. Forgive where you need to. Unfollow what you need to. You’re clearing spiritual clutter before stepping into something real. </p>



<p>And that something real? It starts to crystallize around December 10th, when Neptune stations direct in Pisces, just weeks after Saturn did the same. This is the <em>final direct  Neptune-Saturn pairing in Pisces in your lifetime </em>— and it’s all happening in the part of your life that governs faith, expansion, and your broader worldview. Since 2011, Neptune has been softening your belief systems, inviting you to trust something bigger than control. Saturn joined in 2023 to show you where that trust had to become a practice, not just a Pinterest quote. If you’ve felt spiritually disconnected or unsure of where you’re headed, this month brings grounding to your growth. You may feel called to deepen your studies, return to a forgotten spiritual practice, or even plan a trip that shifts your perspective. This is cosmic wisdom, not just wanderlust. Listen to what your soul has been trying to tell you all along. </p>



<p>Mid-month, the energy pivots fast. The New Moon in Sagittarius on December 19th lands in your sector of health, rituals, and daily rhythm, giving you a fresh start with how you care for your body and manage your mental load. You’re setting intentions around vitality — not perfection. But just four days earlier, Mars enters Capricorn, igniting your relationship zone and kicking off six weeks of serious energy around your partnerships.  Translation? You’ll need to balance your own wellness with the demands of others. From December 21st onward, Capricorn Season — joined by Venus and Juno — deepens your desire for commitment, but also asks for boundaries. Don’t let someone else’s structure become your stress. You’re allowed to prioritize your peace without justifying it. This season teaches you that love isn’t just a feeling: it’s a daily decision to show up, <em>with </em>yourself and <em>for </em>yourself. And that, my friend, is what will make 2026 your thriving year. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831463.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, December starts with all eyes on you, but that doesn’t mean you have to say yes to every invite. The Gemini Full Moon on December 4th floods your social sector, putting friendships, group dynamics, and future plans under a magnifying glass. You might be the one everyone wants at the party, or the one they call when things fall apart. But you’re also the one who needs to check in with your own capacity. Are you  showing up out of joy, or obligation? This lunation brings a culmination from the past six months: maybe a long-term goal starts showing signs of fruition, or a friendship quietly reaches its expiration point. And with Mercury still in Scorpio in retroshade, words carry weight. So before you commit to one more “collab” or group chat or invitation, ask: does this still light me up, or just drain me? </p>



<p>Behind the scenes, something deeper is shifting. Neptune stations direct in Pisces on  December 10th, joining Saturn — both now moving forward in your most vulnerable, transformational zone. This is the last time in your life these two will move forward together in this part of your chart, and it’s a big deal. Since 2011, Neptune has asked you to surrender your tight grip on control when it comes to intimacy, trust, and merging — emotionally, sexually, or financially. Saturn came in 2023 to put some structure around all that soul work. And now, you’re beginning to feel the payoff. You’ve  grown. You’ve released. You’ve survived things you didn’t think you could name, let alone move through. This month might bring an invitation to go deeper with someone — or to go deeper with yourself. Either way, you’re not here for shallow exchanges anymore. If it’s not real, it’s not for you. </p>



<p>And then comes your reawakening: the Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th lands in your pleasure zone. This is a cosmic green light for fun, creativity, love, and unapologetic joy. You might feel pulled to start a new artistic project, flirt more boldly, or reenter your soft era. But just a few days earlier, Mars enters Capricorn, activating  your health, wellness, and daily routine zone for six weeks — and here’s where the tension sets in. One part of you wants to dance barefoot under the stars. The other part needs to clean your inbox and fix your posture. When Capricorn Season arrives on  December 21st, followed by Venus and Juno, your days may start filling up with tasks, obligations, or wellness goals. Don’t let the pressure to “optimize” steal your sparkle. Your joy <em>is </em>sacred work. So is your rest. Let December be both a celebration and a sacred recalibration. You’re allowed to shine on your own terms, and 2026 is the year you’ll do just that. </p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831464.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, December begins with a spotlight on you, and for once, you might not deflect it.  The Gemini Full Moon on December 4th lands at the peak of your chart, illuminating your career, reputation, and long-term vision. Something you’ve been working toward  since summer may finally reach its moment of clarity or culmination. But this lunation is  less about the achievement and more about <em>how it feels</em>. Are you proud? Are you exhausted? Are you pretending to be fine because that’s easier than admitting you’re running on empty? With Mercury, your planetary ruler, still in Scorpio’s post-retrograde shadow, the energy is intense. But you’re being asked to name what success means to you <em>now</em>, not what it meant six months ago. You’ve changed. Your needs have changed. Let your definition of accomplishment evolve with you. </p>



<p>Beneath the surface, a more intimate reckoning is underway. Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th, joining Saturn in your relationship sector — both now moving forward together in this part of your life for the <em>last time in your lifetime</em>. Since 2011, Neptune has blurred the lines between you and others: between love and illusion, giving and over giving, merging and losing yourself. Saturn arrived in 2023 to draw  boundaries where there were none. Now, you’re integrating those lessons. You may be seeing a current or past relationship more clearly than ever — not because someone changed, but because <em>you </em>did. This isn’t about judgment. It’s about discernment. Who do you become in the presence of another? Where do you compromise your truth in the name of harmony? These are questions you’re finally ready to answer, and act on. Whether a partnership deepens or dissolves, the clarity will feel like relief. </p>



<p>The Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th invites you back into your emotional roots — your home, your body, your past. It’s a chance to redefine safety and reclaim softness. Maybe you’re moving, renovating, or just finally clearing the emotional weight from your living space. You don’t have to do it all at once… just begin where your heart feels ready. But don’t get too cozy: Mars enters Capricorn on December 15th, igniting your creativity, romance, and joy zone for six weeks. You’re being called to pour energy into something <em>you </em>love — not something others expect from you. From December 21st onward, the Capricorn stellium invites a passionate reset. Prioritize play. Take your  dreams seriously. Your inner child has been waiting for your attention — not your  perfection. Let December be a mix of softness and fire. Your tenderness is part of your power now, and that’s what’s going to make 2026 your best year yet. </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831465.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, this month kicks off with a zoomed-out, wide-angle lens on your life. The Gemini Full Moon on December 4th lights up the part of your chart that rules your perspective  — your sense of meaning, belief, truth. Something clicks into place. Maybe a story you’ve been telling yourself reveals a deeper thread. Maybe you realize a chapter has closed, even if you never said it out loud. There could be literal travel or legal  paperwork involved, or a publishing opportunity that opens a door. But the deeper shift is internal: you’re not willing to pretend anymore. And with Mercury still in its post retrograde shadow, it’s wise to choose your words carefully. You don’t need to make a grand declaration… you just need to honor the version of you who’s growing out of old frameworks. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, something more embodied is quietly taking shape. Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th, joining Saturn — both now moving forward in your sector of wellness, routines, and energetic boundaries. This is the <em>final time in your lifetime </em>these two will be direct together in Pisces. Since 2011, Neptune has been washing away your  illusions around perfection, service, and “fixing” things through busyness. Saturn came in 2023 to ground your rhythms. Now, it’s time to integrate. You may feel a call to simplify your schedule, recommit to your health, or finally stop performing balance and <em>actually </em>cultivate it. The healing won’t come from controlling everything, it will come from honoring what your body already knows. Ritual. Boundaries. Sleep. Water. Less noise. More breath. You don’t have to earn your rest. You just have to <em>choose </em>it. </p>



<p>Then comes a shift in momentum. The Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th lands in your communication sector, helping you reset your mindset, clarify your message, or start something that requires your voice. This is a powerful time for pitches, posts, writing projects, or simply reconnecting with curiosity. Say what you need to say. But keep it honest — and kind. Just four days earlier, Mars enters Capricorn, launching a  six-week activation of your home, family, and emotional roots.  </p>



<p>And from December 21st onward, Capricorn Season begins, followed by Venus and Juno stacking up in the same part of your sky. You’ll be asked to get more honest about your foundations: where you live, who you lean on, what “safety” means to you. Home isn’t always cozy. Sometimes it’s confronting. Let December show you where structure can liberate you — not trap you. You’re not seeking control, you’re seeking  peace. And you’re brave enough to build it as we enter 2026. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831467.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, you’re no stranger to transformation, but this month asks you to <em>release power struggles you didn’t realize you were still holding onto</em>. The Gemini Full Moon on  December 4th brings something hidden into full view, likely around money, sex, or trust. You may realize you’ve been overly dependent on someone else’s resources, or  you’ve been overly guarded around your own. This is the kind of lunation that makes you whisper “never again” and <em>mean it</em>. But it’s not about cutting people off — it’s about reclaiming the energy you’ve unconsciously leaked. If you’ve been stuck in a  loop around fear of loss, this moon might help you <em>choose liberation over control</em>. Pay  attention to what conversations come up around shared finances, inheritances, debt, or intimacy. The message? You don’t have to prove your power. Just live it. </p>



<p>Then comes a turning point that’s as subtle as it is seismic. Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th, joined by Saturn — both moving forward now in the part of your life that governs joy, play, and creative expression. This is the <em>last time </em>Neptune  will move direct in Pisces in your lifetime, and with Saturn in the mix, you’re being asked to take your joy seriously. Have you been romanticizing suffering? Avoiding your true desires? Over the past 14 years, Neptune’s been dissolving illusions around who you need to be to receive love, while Saturn’s been building boundaries that protect  your heart. This month, you’re invited to honor the creative muse within, whether through art, children, romance, or unapologetic fun. Pleasure is sacred. Don’t postpone it. </p>



<p>Mid-month, your energy gets grounded in practical magic. The Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th sets the stage for new beginnings in your money and self-worth zone.  This is your annual opportunity to rewire your relationship to earning, spending, and valuing your time. Ask yourself: what am I <em>really </em>worth? Then ask again. If you’ve been undercharging, overworking, or waiting for external validation, this lunation helps you  plant seeds for more aligned abundance. Four days earlier, Mars, your traditional ruler, enters Capricorn, kicking off a six-week period of laser-sharp focus in your communication and planning sector. You’ll end the month writing, speaking, negotiating, editing, and strategizing your way to the next level. Ascension season is here, and 2026 will be your most brilliant year yet.  </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831468.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, this is your month, but before the confetti starts flying, the Gemini Full  Moon on December 4th throws a sharp spotlight on your one-on-one relationships. Is there harmony or imbalance in the way you show up for others — and the way they  show up for you? Someone may reveal their true intentions, or you might realize you’ve  been dimming your brilliance to keep the peace. This is a “define the relationship” moon, whether in romance, business, or collaboration. If things have been unsaid, now’s the time to say them. And if you’ve been waiting for a cosmic green light to walk away from something that no longer aligns? This moon hands you the keys and says “Drive.” </p>



<p>Mid-month, you might feel a quiet but deeply emotional shift as Neptune and Saturn station direct in Pisces, activating your home and roots sector. These two planets have been unearthing buried stories from your lineage, resurfacing generational patterns, and reminding you that “home” is more than a place, it’s a feeling. Neptune’s final months in Pisces mark the end of a 14-year chapter of dissolving illusions around family, safety, and belonging. If you’ve felt untethered or nostalgic, these feelings might peak before clarity finally arrives. With Saturn also moving forward, you’re ready to take grounded, mature steps to create a foundation that actually supports you. Don’t ignore the urge to nest, cry, write letters you don’t send, or create altars for your ancestors. It’s healing season, even in the middle of your birthday glow up. </p>



<p>Then comes your cosmic reset. The Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th is your personal New Year. It’s a rare chance to rewrite your story and step into a new level of self-actualization. If you’ve been feeling like you’ve outgrown your own skin, this lunation gives you the freedom to expand into your next evolution. Reintroduce yourself… not just to others, but to <em>yourself</em>. What would it look like to truly embody your purpose without apology? What would it feel like to no longer filter your light? Around this time, Mars enters Capricorn, and a powerful stellium begins activating your money and value zone. Yes, you’re the main character, but the universe wants to make sure you’re paid like it, too. Just don’t burn out trying to be everything to everyone. This month is a masterclass in pacing, presence, and potency. Be bold, but be intentional, and most importantly, be ready for the expansive gifts 2026 has in store. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831469.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the month of December begins with a cosmic cleanse. The Gemini Full Moon on December 4th hits your sector of health, service, and routine, illuminating  what’s been neglected or overworked. This is the universe’s way of saying: check in before you check out. Have you been pushing yourself too hard without proper rest?  Have you fallen into habits that no longer serve the version of you you’re becoming?  Use this lunation to recalibrate. Small, consistent shifts now can lead to major upgrades later. If a job, task, or daily rhythm feels hollow, it may be time to release it. And if your body has been sending messages through fatigue or tension, this moon amplifies them so you <em>finally </em>listen. </p>



<p>The middle of the month ushers in a quiet but powerful frequency shift as Neptune and Saturn go direct in Pisces, your zone of communication and mental processing. It’s like waking up from a long dream and realizing what was fogged is now coming into view. You may have revelations about past conversations, family dynamics, or the way your inner voice talks to you. Saturn helps you get honest — even if it’s uncomfortable — while Neptune reawakens your poetic, visionary side. Writing, teaching, or sharing your  thoughts publicly could bring healing, not just for others, but for <em>you</em>. If you’ve been silencing yourself or doubting your voice, this month gives you the courage to speak from a deeper place. </p>



<p>Then, the magic begins. The Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th falls in your sector of surrender, dreams, and the unseen. This is your time to retreat and reset before your season begins. Rather than rushing ahead with big goals, pause. Reflect. What inner narratives need to be rewritten? What subconscious patterns are you ready to dissolve? Don’t underestimate the power of rest, ritual, and release. Around this time, Mars enters Capricorn, activating your identity and willpower. The final days of the year are a portal: you’ll feel your energy shift from introspection to embodiment. A whole new you is emerging, but first, give yourself permission to integrate all that you’ve learned. What’s done is done. What’s coming is yours. Step into 2026 with quiet confidence. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831471.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, December begins with a jolt of heart-centered electricity. The Gemini Full  Moon on December 4th lights up your sector of joy, flirtation, and self-expression.  Suddenly, your inner artist, romantic, or performer is wide awake. Something you’ve  been creating or dreaming about since the summer may come full circle now — especially in your love life or creative pursuits. If you’ve been craving connection or validation, this lunation reminds you that it starts with <em>you</em>. Write that poem, take that selfie, or plan that spontaneous date. But also: notice where your inner child might still be waiting for your attention. What if play was your medicine? </p>



<p>As the month deepens, so does your relationship with security. Saturn and Neptune shifting direct in Pisces in your income and values zone marks a turning point in your financial story. Neptune’s fog lifts, so you might get clarity on where you’ve been undercharging, overgiving, or chasing illusions. Meanwhile your ruler Saturn brings the blueprint. This is the last chapter of a long lesson in knowing your worth and building from it. You may revisit your budget or launch a new stream of income that’s both  spiritually aligned and materially grounding. Money isn’t just about survival anymore…  it’s becoming a reflection of your energy. </p>



<p>The Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th brings a wave of visionary inspiration through your sector of networks and purpose. Who are you becoming, and who’s coming with you? Whether it’s launching a digital project, joining a mission-driven group, or redefining your circle of trust, this lunation is a portal into the future. You’re redefining what “community” means and attracting people who feel like soul fam, not just followers. Set intentions that stretch beyond borders; this moon is big-picture energy, and it’s got your name on it. </p>



<p>Then comes a whisper from the deep. Mars enters Capricorn just as the sun nears your shadow sector, initiating a six-week inward journey. The Capricorn stellium starting December 21st pulls your energy toward reflection, endings, and recalibration. This isn’t  about pushing through, it’s about moving <em>with </em>your inner tides. Some of your most important work this month will be done behind the scenes, in silence, or in dreamspace. Let go of what’s expired. Release guilt about needing more space. Your season is coming, Aquarius — and when it arrives, you’ll be crystal clear on what to  leave behind and what to boldly carry forward. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831472.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, December begins with a spotlight on your roots and emotional security. The  Gemini Full Moon on December 4th electrifies your home and family sector, bringing  buried feelings to the surface and illuminating patterns you’re ready to outgrow. You might feel more sensitive than usual to your environment, especially to the words,  rhythms, and energy exchanges within your household. Maybe you’re realizing how deeply your early upbringing shaped the way you express yourself or how you navigate relationships. This is a chance to rewrite the narrative. What would it look like to feel safe <em>and </em>free? To let yourself be both soft <em>and </em>sovereign? </p>



<p>Then comes the cosmic homecoming. Both Neptune and Saturn station direct in your sign, marking a massive turning point in your self-concept and spiritual evolution. Neptune’s been with you for 14 years, and this is the final chapter of an identity dissolving, soul-rebuilding era. Saturn joined in 2023, offering structure to all the sacred mess. If you’ve felt blurry, slowed down, or extra sensitive lately, their direct motion may feel like the fog lifting from your mirror. You’ll see yourself more clearly, name what  you’ve outgrown, and remember that boundaries don’t block love… they <em>channel </em>it. </p>



<p>In the second half of the month, the Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th activates your visibility and career path. This is a powerful time to set goals related to your public image, long-term legacy, and leadership. Don’t be afraid to take up more space — especially if you’ve been waiting for the “perfect” time. The world is more ready for  your magic than you realize. Ask yourself: what dream would I pursue if I truly believed  I was qualified? And if fear of being seen is rising — good. It means you’re growing. </p>



<p>Mars enters Capricorn on December 15th, followed by a Capricorn stellium that  culminates at the solstice. This energizes your friendships, community, and long-term visions. You might feel pulled to collaborate, lead a group project, or finally launch something that’s been incubating all year. But beware of burnout… not every connection is meant to be kept. Stay rooted in your values as the invitations and DMs roll in. You’re not just building momentum this month — you’re building meaningful moments. </p>



<p>And then, a surge of support arrives. The Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th activates your visibility and career path. This is a powerful time to set goals related to your public image, long-term legacy, and leadership. Don’t be afraid to take up more space, especially if you’ve been waiting for the “perfect” time. The world is more ready  for your magic than you realize. Ask yourself: what dream would I pursue if I truly believed I was qualified? And if fear of being seen is rising — good. It means you’re  growing, and 2026 is the year where some of your deepest desires manifest with ease. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11945890.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /><figcaption>Getty Images. </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>From November 30th to December 24th, Venus is flirting and taking chances in Sagittarius. At this point, we are seeking pleasure and adventure. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Venus in Sagittarius</a> allows us to experience and explore the attributes of the Fire sign in a personal way, which includes honesty and directness. Plus, an optimistic outlook and approach to dating. We tend to give a lot of ourselves and bet on love. Nothing can hold us back!</p>



<p>This time around, Venus in Sagittarius might make us long to connect with others. Urging us to be adventurous and noncommittal, we are currently wanting to form connections and unions with others. The caveat is that when Venus aspects Saturn and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/neptune-retrograde-in-aries-pisces-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Neptune in Pisces</a>, we might get caught up in the illusion or dream of another. Be cautious to recognize the red flags and trust your intuition. Saturn’s square to Venus will make us feel like we aren’t enough, which is why we have to do some internal healing to boost our confidence. Neptune’s fraught position to Venus makes us hazy and unsure of our motives, but pushes us down the rabbit hole when it comes to romantic matters.</p>



<p>Saturn’s presence could suggest a financial deficiency. Neptune’s moonwalk alongside Venus (until December 10th, when Neptune turns direct) means that we might be deceived or played with when it comes to money matters (even through <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/money-personalities-spending-habits-explained"">an investment opportunity</a>). Be cautious not to lend money to someone you know will be unlikely to repay it on time. Keep all the receipts from holiday shopping to check if anyone is making excessive charges on your credit card that require verification. Chances are that returns are made since you may be enticed to spend beyond your budget. The best way to handle this energy is to be in control and aware of the situation.</p>



<p>The good news is that our creativity will shine brightly in the weeks ahead. These planets are highlighting our artistic senses, giving us some insight and clarity into our emotions that we need to showcase to the world. Any ventures, even if they’re hobbies, will prove to be lucrative at this time, inspiring us to take our dreams to the next level. Perhaps opening an online shop to sell our services and objects could elevate our confidence as well as our wallets. As long as we believe in ourselves, it’ll happen. </p>



<p>On a personal level, we will be called to confront the real versions of ourselves. This means that we are letting people catch a glimpse of our hearts, passions, and authentic identities, which we’ve been hiding from the world for some time, and breaking out of self-imposed ruts. Venus in Sagittarius wants us to push through to the other side and heighten our successes. We shouldn’t hold ourselves back, nor should we let others do so. Giving people a peek into our souls is going to be the best way to create openness and to feel seen. Confronting ourselves and nature will help us grow and reveal the greatest versions of ourselves. </p>



<p>Venus in Sagittarius offers us a rare glimpse into what we want and need in partnerships. We are currently writing the script, so focusing on what resonates with us on a deep level is essential. Pay attention to how you treat yourself and try to give yourself more TLC. After all, it is the most crucial relationship that you’ll ever commit to.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11945566.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>I love the holiday season but used to dread the endless to-do list and copious shopping required — it weighed on me like a too-heavy ornament pulling down a Christmas tree branch. So, imagine my delight when I found that my favorite app for takeout, <strong>DoorDash</strong>, offers way more than good eats.</p>



<p style=""text-align: left;"">I made this discovery last Halloween, when I set out in a panic to find my son a pumpkin-shaped basket for trick-or-treating. It was the day of, and all the stores were sold out. Same-day shipping wasn’t an option. Frustrated and stressed, I shifted my focus to lunch (a carb-heavy meal was needed to soothe my sorrows). I opened my <a href=""http://doordash.com/"">DoorDash</a> app and noticed a bunch of categories beyond food for the first time. I clicked on “Retail,” searched “Halloween Candy Basket,” and behold: exactly what I needed, available for delivery in under an hour. </p>



<p>And that’s how I discovered my gift-giving secret. Using DoorDash for gifts is alarmingly simple — not unlike the ease of ordering food. It works pretty much the same way. Search the product category you’re interested in (beauty, apparel, electronics, sports, etc) and voila, options abound! Most items arrive in less than an hour, great for those last-minute ladies. Just this week, mere hours before our arrival, I sent my crafty aunt a <a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/29845282/search/cricut%20joy?attr_src=search&amp;disable_spell_check=false""><strong>Cricut Machine</strong></a> from Michael’s as a thank-you for hosting Thanksgiving.</p>



<p>I’ll be using DoorDash on Black Friday to begin my holiday shopping, all from the comfort of my couch. From November 28 to December 24, hundreds of holiday favorites from retailers like Sephora, Best Buy, and Dick’s Sporting Goods are up to 30% off on DoorDash nationwide. I’ll be snagging <strong><a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/26060023/search/airpod%20pros?attr_src=home&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">AirPod Pros</a></strong> for my husband from Best Buy. From Dick’s Sporting Goods I’ve got my eyes on a <strong><a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/23887136/search/raskullz%20toddler%20helmet?attr_src=search&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Raskullz Toddler helmet</a></strong> for my son and a <strong><a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/23887136/search/stanley%20quencher?attr_src=search&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Stanley Quencher</a></strong> for my cardio-obsessed bestie.</p>

<p>My cart will be full of goodies from Sephora for all my upcoming White Elephant needs. I’m talking <strong><a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/24102893/search/biodance%20real%20deep%20mask?attr_src=home&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Biodance Real Deep Mask</a> </strong>gift sets, <strong><a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/24102893/search/tarte%20mini%20tartlette?attr_src=search&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tarte Mini Tartlette</a> </strong>mascaras and<a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/24102893/search/Tower%2028%20mini%20LipSoftie?attr_src=search&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> </a><strong><a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/24102893/search/Tower%2028%20mini%20LipSoftie?attr_src=search&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tower 28 mini LipSoftie</a> </strong>lip treatments. And hey, I need to look my best this holiday season too, don’t I? A <strong><a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/24102893/search/dyson%20airwrap?attr_src=search&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dyson Airwrap</a></strong> is my gift to myself.</p>



<p>I plan to send <strong><a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/35890445/search/matching%20pjs?attr_src=search&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">matching PJs</a> </strong>from the Gap and <strong><a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/35890445/search/fuzzy%20slippers?attr_src=home&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">fuzzy slippers</a> </strong>from American Eagle to some of the holiday-obsessed folks in my life. I’ve got my eyes on an Old Navy<a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/36558445/search/girls%20bomber%20jacket?attr_src=search&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> </a><strong><a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/36558445/search/girls%20bomber%20jacket?attr_src=search&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">bomber jacket</a></strong> perfect for my 9-year-old niece. As for my four-legged niece, PetSmart has great finds, like this <strong><a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/1440375/search/pink%20candy%20cane%20dog%20blanket?attr_src=home&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pink Candy Cane dog blanket</a></strong> from Merry &amp; Bright.</p>



<p>If it’s not already obvious, DoorDash has it all, which makes a <strong><a href=""https://www.doordash.com/consumer/gift-cards/?from_gift_store=true"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">DoorDash gift card</a> </strong>a failproof gift idea. I’ll be stocking up on Black Friday when they are 15% off and 25% off exclusively for DashPash members.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11945568.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>For those unfamiliar, the DashPass subscription is only $9.99 per month and offers free delivery on many items and reduced service fees. As my go-to app for basically everything, DashPass was an obvious yes. </p>



<p>If you need another reason to join, from December 10 to December 12, DashPass members get 15% off gift cards at select favorites including Xbox, Roblox, Best Buy, Panera Bread, Ulta, Gap and more.</p>



<p>I can not stress enough how many times DoorDash has saved me. I’ve sent <a href=""https://www.doordash.com/store/sprinkles-cupcakes-manhattan-beach-24339072/17524546/""><strong>cupcakes from Sprinkles</strong></a> and <a href=""https://www.doordash.com/business/Levain-Bakery-19070/?CX_US_SE_SU_GO_ACQ_CUSXXX_13078187214_RSTRNT_%2BNB_ACQ_RESTR_IMMERCHANTXXX_EVG_CPAx_EPX_COUSA_EN_EN_X_DOOR_GO_SE_TXT_LXXXXXXXXX&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=SEMu&amp;utm_campaign=CX_US_SE_SU_GO_ACQ_CUSXXX_13078187214_RSTRNT_%2BNB_ACQ_RESTR_IMMERCHANTXXX_EVG_CPAx_EPX_COUSA_EN_EN_X_DOOR_GO_SE_TXT_LXXXXXXXXX&amp;utm_term=doordash%20levain%20bakery&amp;utm_content=121857044043&amp;kclickid=_k_CjwKCAiAuIDJBhBoEiwAxhgyFm6EwbwY6NG_nPhocQzav_CqqqMnY6oiByWZyl3yVKas8n5XcNuvMRoCwNQQAvD_BwE_k_&amp;utm_adgroup_id=121857044043&amp;utm_creative_id=770585139540&amp;utm_keyword_id=aud-966867198856:kwd-1261700936846&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=13078187214&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADemgEvQt-y_wsUVPFiD4iSZUrPRS&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAuIDJBhBoEiwAxhgyFm6EwbwY6NG_nPhocQzav_CqqqMnY6oiByWZyl3yVKas8n5XcNuvMRoCwNQQAvD_BwE""><strong>cookies from Levain’s Bakery</strong></a><strong> </strong>as day-of birthday treats, and plan to do the same as holiday gifts for work associates.

<p>DoorDash has transformed Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and holiday shopping all together from a source of anxiety to a welcome occasion. Happy Holidays, indeed. </p>

<p>I was warned about<em> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYcgQMxQwmk"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hamnet</a>. </em>Anyone who knows me knows that I am a crier and that I am easily susceptible to emotional manipulation; whether it’s a schmaltzy commercial with an intergenerational storyline or a corny Hallmark movie about the healing capacity of Christmas, I will weep. So, when it comes to a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/marvel-eternals-director-chloe-zhao-interview"">Chloe Zhao</a> directed, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/26/movies/hamnet-review.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">critically-lauded drama</a> about the loss of a child and art as a tool to cope with grief, people in my life knew that it would break me. And despite their disclaimers, it did.</p>



<p><em>Hamnet</em> unfolds slowly, telling the story of William Shakespeare (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/paul-mescal-normal-people-season-two"">Paul Mescal</a>) and his wife Anne Hathaway, or Agnes Shakespeare (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/jessie-buckley-lost-daughter-interview"">Jessie Buckley</a>) as she’s known in this adaptation of Maggie O’Farrell’s book <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/books/review/hamnet-maggie-ofarrell.html""><em>Hamnet: A Novel of the Plague</em></a>, as they fall in love and have three children including their son, Hamnet. The names Hamnet and Hamlet were often used interchangeably back then and this is O’Farrell’s interpretation of what led to Shakespeare’s masterpiece. </p>



<p>In the first half, <em>Hamnet</em> is about the tender beginnings of a relationship and the complexity of marriage. It’s about a free spirit and a neurotic writer navigating their different desires and a long-distance relationship. There are sly nods to Shakespeare’s most famous work, like the fact that William and Agnes are star-crossed lovers as he presumably scribbles down<em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/11/127977/romeo-and-juliet-movie-what-is-true-love""> Romeo &amp; Juliet</a> </em>by candlelight or that William’s relationship with his dad proves Shakespeare’s daddy issues were in full effect. The subtlety stops there. The second half of <em>Hamnet </em>is unflinching, a devastating portrait of the grief that accompanies unconditional love. At certain moments, <em>Hamnet</em> made me angry; I was begging for a break from the onslaught of emotional tyranny it was reigning over its audience. At others, I was grateful for its vulnerability and unabashed sentimentality. If Zhao and co. were manipulating me into crying so hard I had a headache for hours after the credits rolled, it worked. Anything that succeeds in eliciting that much emotion and draws out these extraordinary performances from two of the best actors of their generation is, to me, a triumph.  </p>



<p>When I speak to Mescal and Buckley over Zoom, they’re a lot gigglier than you may expect considering both are known for playing roles that rip your heart out and give your tear ducts a workout. They are thoughtful, polite, and playfully rib each other with the ease of old friends. Below, the Irish actors talk about the emotional weight of <em>Hamnet</em>, the first movies that made them cry, and gush about their co-star to the hilarious discomfort of the other. </p>







<p><strong>Refinery29:</strong> <strong>I’m sure you’ve gotten this a lot today but this movie fucked me <em>up</em></strong><strong>. I was sobbing hysterically by the end. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal: </strong><em>[Both laugh].</em></p>



<p><strong>I feel like people need a disclaimer that they are going to cry a lot. Can you just give a warning or any advice on how to prepare for the emotional experience of watching this film? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Jessie Buckley: </strong>To feel is quite scary. To feel at all is scary. I think we try to control what that is in our lives and in some ways, there’s so much catharsis to connect again to the epicness of just being alive. And this film is so full of love. It’s so full of the courage to love fully and to live fully, and to lose. And anytime you choose to love, you also choose to potentially lose. You’re risking to lose somebody in your life. But I think there’s a lot of catharsis and hope and healing in this film, and you’re not on your own. There’s going to be somebody beside you who’s going to have a tissue, and they’re going to give it to you, and you’re going to have a big chat and a hug afterwards and you’re going to think<em> that was great.</em></p>



<p><strong>Paul Mescal:<em> </em></strong><em>[laughs] </em>Okay, that was great! </p>



<p><strong>Make it a community experience! </strong></p>



<p><strong>JB:<em> </em></strong><em>[laughs] </em>That wasn’t my experience. I locked myself in a toilet for half an hour afterwards. </p>

<p><strong>Yes, I needed to decompress! Do either of you remember the first movie that made you cry or made you feel like this film does? </strong></p>



<p><strong>JB: </strong>Yes,<strong> </strong><em><a href=""https://www.disneyplus.com/browse/entity-35142c55-bb03-459c-8646-302379fb29b6"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Darby O’Gill and the Little People </a></em>[1959]<em>. </em>Because there was a banshee and I thought that was the most terrifying thing in the whole wide world.

<p><strong>Well, you both made <em>me</em></strong><strong> cry. But the movie doesn’t work without your chemistry. William and Agnes are two big characters to embody and you both did so beautifully. I want to give you a moment to look at each other and gush about working with each other and what makes each other so great. </strong></p>



<p><strong>PM:</strong> Jessie is just [<em>laughs</em>] — This is not just a performance of the year, this is a performance, and I’ve said this before, but this is going to be studied in drama schools. Actors around the world, if you want to see what great acting is, not only just watch <em>Hamnet</em>, watch anything that Jessie has ever been in, and you’d be well fed. And that’s all the time we have for today! [<em>laughs</em>] </p>



<p><strong>JB:</strong> No <em>[laughs]</em>. I feel like I’ve met somebody so significant and giant in my life in working with Paul on this. Firstly, he is absolutely… No, firstly, he has the most…  </p>



<p><strong>PM:</strong> <em>[laughs] </em>Firstly, <em>Darby O’Gill and the Little People. </em></p>



<p><strong>JB: </strong><em>[laughs] </em>No, no! He has such a gigantic human heart, and he’s such a team player. He holds the biggest parts of you. He can drink a case of you, and not many people can, especially co-leads. Not many people can just, with absolute care and courage, help you to tell the story. I mean this with so much sincerity and belief: he is a movie star, and he wears it — </p>



<p><strong>PM: </strong><em>[nervous, uncomfortable laughter] </em></p>



<p><strong>JB:</strong> No, you are! You just are. It’s true for you, and that’s because you have this capacity of being a giant. You are a giant person.</p>



<p><strong>PM:</strong> I am of average height <em>[laughs]. </em></p>



<p><strong>JB: </strong> <em>[laughs]</em> No, your heart is gigantic.

<p>If minimalist nail art is more your thing, then <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/mydumbnails/"">Wendy’s</a> pared-back take on festive nails will certainly appeal. There’s still glitz in the form of 3D pearls and golden rhinestones, and the petite dots of color really pop against a sheer, milky base color.

<p>If there’s one thing we can count on Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers for, it’s a hyper-specific pop culture reference. For the last decade, the comedic duo have mined the deepest corners of queer cultural zeitgeist on their podcast<em> Las Culturistas</em>, which snagged iHeartRadio’s Podcast Of The Year Award in 2023. This holiday season, their new <a href=""https://www.marshalls.com/us/store/index.jsp"">Marshalls</a> campaign — <a href=""https://www.marshalls.com/us/store/shop/marshalls-it-s-giving-gifts/_/N-3830075267"">It’s Giving Gifts!</a> — channels their encyclopedic archive of niche archetypes into the highest form of holiday-season community service: helping shoppers find the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-art-of-giving"">perfect present for every type of person</a> in their lives.<br /><br />From best gifts <a href=""https://www.marshalls.com/us/store/shop/marshalls-it-s-giving-gifts/_/N-3830075267?icid=11.17.25:Marshalls:Homepage_Desktop::Its_Giving_Gifts_Block1_All"">“for the homebody who loves their sourdough starter more than you, and you have accepted that”</a> to selections for <a href=""https://www.marshalls.com/us/store/shop/marshalls-it-s-giving-gifts-made-in-italy/_/N-2758068732?auxcid2=11.10.25:Marshalls:LP_Desktop:Its_Giving_Gifts:MII"">“the cool girl who is always late and makes you think punctuality is kind of embarrassing”</a> and <a href=""https://www.marshalls.com/us/store/shop/marshalls-it-s-giving-gifts-gifts-for-teens/_/N-3954653793?auxcid2=11.10.25:Marshalls:LP_Desktop:Its_Giving_Gifts:For_Teens"">“the teen who has so much drip you were left with no choice but to use the word “‘drip’ to describe them”</a> — each gift guide offers meticulously curated, cross-category selections from designer labels and beloved brands at a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-luxury-gifts-under-50"">wide variety of price points</a>. <br /><br />“Saying that you love Marshalls is like ordering Diet Coke for the table,” Yang tells Refinery29 while we chat in-store at Marshalls in Manhattan. “You empower other people to say something they thought was buried: ‘Oh, wait, I’ve always loved Marshalls too.’”<br /><br />Below, Yang and Rogers share their best tips for picking the perfect gift, their most formative holiday memories, and the greatest presents they’ve ever given — and received.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>





<p><strong>Let’s talk about my personal favorite gift-guide archetype — gifts for “the cool girl who is always late and makes punctuality seem kind of embarrassing.” To reference the recurring segment on your podcast — what are the cultural moments that made this cool girl who she is today?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Bowen Yang</strong>: We all know this girl. We might even be this girl. This girl saw <em>Mean Girls</em> in theaters at least 5 times in 2004. She really imprinted on — not Romy and Michelle — but she identified with their bullies. Maybe [they identify] with Janeane Garofalo ’cause they like a quick-smoke cigarette because they have places to be and they are always late to those places.<br /><br /><strong>Matt Rogers: </strong>I would say it’s that girl from high school who you’re like: “You learned the wrong thing from Regina George.”  But… she looked good.</p>



<p><strong>There’s so many cute purses and shoes in the “cool girl” gift guide. Where is the cool girl wearing these accessories while out and about in Manhattan?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Yang: </strong>She’s taking this to Balthazar, Carbone, the Whitney, the Circle Line Cruise so she can swing around [her purse] while the DJ plays a song on a boat. <br /><br /><strong>Rogers:</strong> She’s going to take this to Zero Bond. She’s going to walk past Taylor Swift, and Taylor’s gonna go: “So sorry, where did you get that bag?” She’ll say: “Marshalls.” And she’s going to wink at Taylor, and Taylor’s gonna be like: “Travis, we gotta go. Let’s get to Marshalls.” </p>





<p><strong>Be honest, did you have any specific friends in mind when creating the “cool girl”” gift guide?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Yang: </strong>I would say our friend Greta [Gerwig] — who we love. Greta is giving both Sabrina Carpenter and early aughts SJP, plus the dad’s girlfriend from <em>The Parent Trap</em>.<br /><br /><strong>Rogers: </strong>Yeah. Any stepmother from any movie where the stepmother comes in and is like: “It’s off to boarding school with you.” But we love that stepmother. We aspire to be her.</p>



<p><strong>For the person who just can’t decide on a gift — what picks from your gift guides do you think are the most universal crowd-pleasers?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Yang: </strong>Silk pajamas, skincare… this bag is a star. <a href=""https://www.marshalls.com/us/store/jump/product/Rhinestone-Handbag/4000410744?colorId=NS4155705&amp;pos=1:33&amp;Ntt=silver%20purse&amp;bsp=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">This bag</a> has been with us the entire campaign. And I will never forget about her — she’s high impact. <br /><br /><strong>Rogers: </strong>And you really can’t go wrong with a candle.</p>





<p><strong>You’re clearly both great gift-givers — but what about receiving? Was there a childhood gift that genuinely shaped who you are today</strong><br /><br /><strong>Rogers: </strong>This was the year that PlayStation 2 came out. I was a video game kid — Bowen Yang still is — and I really wanted that PS2. And they were like: “You’re not getting it. It’s too expensive and no one can get it.” And then on Christmas day, I kept opening up PS2 games, and I was like: “Well, I guess you got me the games for one day when I get the system, right?” They were like: “Exactly, one day when you get the system.” Low and behold, the last gift hiding under the couch was the PS2, and I was a very happy boy.<br /><br /><strong>Yang: </strong>Mine was after <em>Batman Forever </em>came out. I had a Batgirl, Alicia Silverstone action figure — that really spoke to me and has since. </p>



<p><strong>What’s the most unexpected place you’ve ever spent the holidays?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Yang: </strong>Someone in my family recently pitched, out of nowhere: “What about Scottsdale this Christmas?” I said: “What about it? We don’t know anybody there.” No shade to Scottsdale it’s just like… why would we go there? <br /><br /><strong>Rogers:</strong> I will be doing a Tampa Christmas because my parents snowbird down there. People who know me are like: “Matt Rogers, Florida for Christmas, checks out.”</p>





<p><strong>What are your favorite types of gifts to give? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Yang: </strong>Candles are a go-to. I think we’re finally, as a culture, coming out of the stigma around candles as gifts. For a while there, it was like: “Oh, you got a candle? How impersonal.” No. No one’s gonna turn down a candle.</p>



<p><strong>Rogers: </strong>I really hit the jackpot one year when I realized that I could get bespoke drink coasters and customize them for my friends. So I got coasters with different pop stars on them and I gave them to all my friends for the pop star that they stan. And I do think that was my best idea and now I have to think of something else creative.</p>
