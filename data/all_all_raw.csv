<p><strong>Anchored in the Landscape</strong> - Marhûs is anchored in its context—both in name and in form. The name Marhûs comes from the Frisian language, in which ""Mar"" means lake and ""hûs"" signifies dwelling or house. Marhûs can be understood to mean lake house, referring to a home located near a lake. Positioned on the edge of a lake, the design expresses a continuous dialogue between architecture, landscape, and space. The site—framed by two small harbors, a garden with mature trees, a reed-fringed quay, and a long jetty—opens up to expansive panoramic views across the water. The architectural gesture conveys a sense of hospitality, craftsmanship, and reverence for nature. Approached from the street, Marhûs presents a modest, understated profile that resonates with the fine grain of the village. Facing the lake, however, it asserts itself with a confident presence that responds to the vast openness of the Frisian landscape.</p>",

From Gropius's <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/bauhaus"">Bauhaus</a> in 1919 to Arcosanti's desert experiments in the 1970s, architecture operated as a form of cultural prophecy. Built form was the argument. The drawing was the vision. Today, we live in a world that remarkably resembles what the starchitects of the 1900s imagined - modular construction, interconnected digital cities, and automated systems. Yet contemporary architecture rarely proposes culture with the same totalizing confidence. </p>",

<p>Nestled in the tranquil coastal village of Quilon, 'Teal' is a seamless four-bedroom residence that reinterprets the essence of tropical Kerala architecture through a contemporary, minimalist lens. The project is a testament to the power of rooted design principles, blending traditional built forms with modern spatial concepts to create a home deeply attuned to its environment.</p>",

<p>Located in a lot with a steep slope and surrounded by preservation forest, the Balance House translates the combination between integration, sophistication and a precise dialog with topography. Designed as a summer house for a couple and their daughter, the residence takes advantage of the natural terrain to create an inverted program: The six bedrooms, all suites, occupy the upper level, facing the view, while the social areas develop on the lower floor, in direct contact with the garden and the pool.</p>",

<p>At first glance, the large buildings in Grentschel appear to be randomly scattered across the valley floor. However, the unassuming Grentschel stream actually plays an organizing role. Each building volume is oriented to the course of the stream and positioned parallel to it. The project adopts this logic, resulting in a relaxed ensemble with fluid outdoor spaces. </p>",

<p>This project is a refurbishment of an early 20th-century, timber-framed beach house on the Ballard Estate in Swanage, Dorset. The house is located on the seafront, within an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.</p>",

<p>This fully serviced Beach Support Facility is located at Praia da Barra in Ílhavo, respecting the Ovar–Marinha Grande Coastal‑Zone Management Plan. That plan, in force since 2017, required the facility to be moved east of the boardwalk that links the local beaches, with the consequent demolition of the existing structure. Formally, the building is defined by its annular geometry, which shields users from prevailing northerly winds on the south‑facing terrace while reducing visual impact by aligning the ring's internal void with one of the dune's highest points. For centuries, the circular plan has been associated with unity, harmony and even eternity, encouraging spatial continuity.</p>",

In fact, I made a similar prediction nearly two years ago. In December 2023, I published an essay titled <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/design-is-dead-and-we-have-killed-it-ba46cf1dc18b""><em>Design Is Dead. And We Have Killed It.</em></a><em> </em>I explored how AI’s rapid evolution would render design — not just designers — obsolete.</p><p>I argued that visual design’s core purpose is to translate complexity into clarity. And if AI can achieve that same clarity by unifying experiences and anticipating needs across contexts — particularly through non-visual interfaces — it will eventually absorb the function of UI design entirely.</p><p>But since writing that article, my perspective has been shifting. I now believe that visual design may still have a pulse. Understanding that future starts with a simple metaphor— <em>taking the scenic route</em>.</p><figure><img alt=""Map with a red route through New Hampshire’s towns and a bright autumn scene of a red covered bridge surrounded by vibrant yellow foliage."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PhVuxIjHSaAi0aL6MOV0vw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Image source: <a href=""https://www.aarp.org/travel/vacation-ideas/road-trips/new-hampshire-road-trip/"">aarp.org</a></figcaption></figure><h4>From utility to choice</h4><p>When traveling, we often face a choice. The fastest route is efficient and predictable, optimized to get us from point A to point B. The scenic route is slower and longer, but richer — winding roads through forests, detours along a coastline. It doesn’t make “sense” in a strictly utilitarian framework, but it does as an expression of human values.</p><p>This metaphor maps directly onto the current debate about design. The rational view assumes that once AI and invisible interfaces handle functional tasks, visual design will become unnecessary. After all, if a <a href=""https://www.uxtigers.com/post/ai-agents"">voice agent</a> can complete a transaction instantly, why bother designing a screen?</p><p>The answer is that necessity and value are not the same thing. While the fastest route may be a straight highway, that doesn’t make it the most meaningful or memorable. In the same way, a frictionless voice interface might be the most efficient way to get something done, but it is not always the most satisfying.</p><p>When trying to understand how such value is communicated, <a href=""http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/S4B/sem06.html"">semiotics</a> can help explain this process by describing the dualistic nature of interface communication.</p><p>Every interface communicates on two levels—the denotative (what it does) and the connotative (what it means). Invisible systems excel at the first. Visible, intentional design emphasizes the second — signaling care, identity, values, and intent. Choosing to design something, even when you don’t need to, declares that the interaction is meant to be experienced, not just completed.</p><p>Think of a banking app that still shows you a welcoming dashboard instead of just confirming a deposit by text, or a smart-home system that visualizes energy usage rather than simply optimizing it silently. Both are gestures that transform a transaction into a relationship. They show that interfaces do more than deliver outcomes—they infuse narratives, values, and meaning into those outcomes.</p><h4>The value of inefficiency</h4><p>Once utility is taken care of by automation, effort itself becomes expressive. What optimization once treated as waste — time, ornament, friction, even delay — can instead become thoughtful design materials. They slow people down just enough to notice, reflect, or connect.</p><p>For users, the “scenic route” means richer, more meaningful interactions. A well-crafted interface invites exploration instead of simple completion, shaping how people feel as they move through a system because it makes the care and effort behind it visible.</p><p>We often feel that difference when someone chooses to spend effort on us.</p><p>For example, when I left a company after nearly 13 years, my boss and mentor mailed me a handwritten note congratulating me and thanking me for my work and friendship. He could have sent an email — faster, clearer, and certainly more legible (his handwriting is atrocious) — but I would have read it once and moved on. Instead, I keep that note on my shelf as a reminder of the effort and story it represents. The message mattered more because it cost something to create.</p><p>This dynamic is well described by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_theory"">signaling theory</a>, which helps explain why effort itself can communicate value. A “costly signal” — one that takes time or effort — carries more weight because it tells users that the experience was worth investing in.</p><p>A handwritten note feels meaningful because someone cared enough to write it. And in the same way, a thoughtfully designed product feels intentional because it respects the user’s humanity.</p><h4><strong>Human variability and the future of design</strong></h4><p>Most people will choose frictionless utility for routine tasks. But smaller groups seeking deeper, more intentional experiences often shape markets and brand perception far beyond their size. Just look at how <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/31/the-observer-view-on-the-joys-of-the-vinyl-record-resurgence"">vinyl records made a comeback</a>. Few would have predicted such a revival in an era dominated by streaming.</p><figure><img alt=""Vinyl album sales chart from 1993 to 2013 shows a rise, peaking in 2013.

The rise of AI and agent-based interaction won’t erase visual design—it will reframe it. As everyday interactions shift toward voice and conversation, design’s role will move from functional to expressive.</p><p>Designers won’t win by competing with AI on speed and output. Machines will always outperform there. But they cannot replicate human judgment, taste, or the ability to infuse meaning into form. The designer’s work will be knowing when a scenic route is worth taking — when inefficiency signals values or identity.</p><p>Visual design will no longer be the default. But precisely because of that, it will become more powerful — shaping meaning in ways automation cannot, long after screens disappear.</p><p><strong><em>Don’t miss out! </em></strong><a href=""https://micbuckcreative.medium.com/subscribe""><strong><em>Join my email list</em></strong></a><strong><em> and receive the latest content.</em></strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=45983f55196e"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/visual-designs-future-is-the-scenic-route-45983f55196e"">Visual design’s future is the scenic route</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Why clear, strategic writing is more critical than ever.</h4><figure><img alt=""An outline of a pencil surrounded by AI icons that look like stars."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sSQy65QWDjIgpqyXRWkEFw.png"" /></figure><p>If you’ve used an AI product recently, you probably know that the technology is incredible. The UX? Not so much.</p><p>Maybe you’ve gotten comfortable writing prompts or using simple one-click tools. But as AI interfaces start to take different forms, many of them are still kinda hard to figure out. Navigating them can be overwhelming. It doesn’t feel like you’re <em>using</em> these products so much as <em>deciphering</em> them. The engineering is powerful, but the flows don’t make sense.</p><p>If you’re lost in an AI user flow, blame the writing.</p><p>Lots of these tools use unclear labeling, make phony promises, or simply cram interfaces with vague, hyphenated phrases like “AI-enabled.”</p><p>The usability issues make sense, because AI is relatively new. We’ve seen this happen before. Think about the first time you tapped on a smartphone. Or the first time you sent an email. Every big shift takes a little getting used to. As new technology arrives, new interaction patterns emerge. And the role of words in the interface needs to be figured out.</p><p>The solution: good UX writing. Smart, strategic, honest language that keeps users clear and makes products simpler. It’s more important than ever.</p><p>So if you’re designing an AI product, here are some things to consider.</p><h3>Define your audience</h3><p>And do it <em>before</em> you write. The first step of writing is understanding your reader. This decision will influence the way you write. It’ll also influence your feature set and product roadmap. Different audiences need different things. An AI fact-checking tool for journalists will look very different than one for biology students.</p><figure><img alt=""Three different CTAs with different phrasing speaking to different audiences."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*penmi9jhlEEyTg33fxDhYg.png"" /><figcaption>Understand who you’re writing for and how they’ll use your product.</figcaption></figure><h3>Decide where AI sits in the product</h3><p>That means shaping the strategy and architecture of whatever you’re building. Before you add AI language and icons onto every screen, align on your approach to AI. Does AI live across the <em>whole</em> product, or just one feature? Is there a character that sits “on top” of the interface?</p><p>Now is also a good time to ask: is your product using AI at all? Have an honest discussion. If it’s not AI, don’t say it is.</p><figure><img alt=""Three screens that introduce an AI product in different ways. The third doesn’t say “AI” at all."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AulYk4ooJpeQNBaDdREBxg.png"" /><figcaption>Consider how you’ll introduce AI, if at all.</figcaption></figure><h3>Guide the user input</h3><p>Millions of people are still learning how AI products work. So when you’re writing, think about the first-time user. Will they know what to search? Which file to upload? Where to go for help? Find ways to share guidance or give examples. The best products make sense from the very first screen.</p><figure><img alt=""Three different ways of showing a search bar.

As you’re choosing good words, think about form, size, color, and spacing. Find the right approach for your information. Maybe that’s a perfect paragraph. Increasingly, it’s short, scannable pieces of text. Try different ways to show the same idea. You can work with the engineering team to create guidelines around how text gets displayed.</p><figure><img alt=""Three screens showing how color, formatting, and lists can add clarity to writing."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bdAajcoy654fJfUlHqCgUg.png"" /><figcaption>Explore different ways of displaying the same information.</figcaption></figure><h3>Choose smart, specific actions</h3><p>This is one of the toughest pieces of language to land for AI tools.

A button that says “use AI” isn’t precise enough.</p><figure><img alt=""Three buttons that say different things about how they’ll change an image.

Photo by <a href=""https://unsplash.com/@coleito"">Cole Keister</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Give a helpful next step</h3><p>The best AI products are more than intuitive — they’re predictive. They understand user needs and suggest a path forward. The next time you’re designing one screen of your product, consider what might come next. Explore common use cases and try to avoid dead ends.</p><figure><img alt=""Three versions of next steps after a query.

Users should know if they’re talking a chatbot—or a person. They should know if the song was written by a musician—or generated by an app. The solution is simple: use words and images to tell the truth.</p><figure><img alt=""Three versions of how content can be labeled depending on if it was created by AI or a person."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MeUCJ5qaDBU6r4EgoNA4TQ.png"" /><figcaption>Be honest about how AI was involved.</figcaption></figure><h3>Show your sources</h3><p>It’s a way to build trust with the user. It’s also a way to keep people safe. Showing your source doesn’t feel all that urgent if you’re displaying NBA scoring titles. But AI products are now commonly used for things like nutrition, finance, and medicine. Users should know where important information is coming from.</p><figure><img alt=""Three ways an AI-generated response might cite the source material."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZvXH_GCOwVg0vpHNJQIbYw.png"" /></figure><h3>Write for all people</h3><p>Many of today’s AI products were built for early adopters. These products use the language — and acronyms — of engineering. And they presume a deep fluency with technology.</p><p>As AI products move into the mainstream, the writing in the interfaces should evolve, too. The writing should become more readable. Respectful. Inclusive.</p><p>Crafting that language takes talent and experience. It requires deep expertise and a sense of empathy. Sure, AI tools can generate endless amounts text.

My brain had completely rewired from “where do I go?” to “what do I want?” — and this cognitive shift happened before the AI could reliably deliver on that promise. This gap between mental transformation and technical reality defines the next decade of UX design.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Yl1U41mM7GSCSVme09UvKA.png"" /><figcaption>Traditional navigation requires multiple decision points and manual processing, while intention-based design compresses user goals into direct AI execution.</figcaption></figure><h3>What makes Comet different from every browser you’ve used</h3><p>Comet isn’t just another browser with AI features bolted on — it’s a fundamental rethinking of what browsers do. Unlike Chrome or Safari, where you navigate TO information, Comet brings information to you.</p><p>Here’s how it works: Instead of a traditional address bar, Comet presents a natural language interface. But the real innovation happens behind the scenes — the browser maintains persistent context across your entire session, understanding not just your current query, but your underlying intent.</p><figure><img alt=""Comet’s clean interface featuring natural language search instead of traditional URL navigation"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*47gAe3dhGpY0bHBdR4gxqg.png"" /><figcaption>Comet’s clean interface featuring natural language search instead of traditional URL navigation.</figcaption></figure><p>Three core capabilities distinguish Comet from traditional browsers:</p><p><strong>Contextual AI assistant</strong>: A sidebar that doesn’t just answer questions — it proactively analyzes what you’re viewing and suggests relevant insights. Looking at flight options? It compares prices across tabs automatically.</p><figure><img alt=""Comet AI sidebar analyzing gluten-free candy selection at Mercadona, displaying contextual product recommendations while maintaining awareness of celiac dietary constraints"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3UPryT_FiqFtjfytQbdKGQ.png"" /><figcaption>Comet AI sidebar analyzing gluten-free candy selection at Mercadona, displaying contextual product recommendations while maintaining awareness of celiac dietary constraints.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Persistent intent memory</strong>: Unlike chat interfaces that forget context when you close them, Comet maintains understanding of your goals across your entire browsing session. Start researching hotels in one tab, and it remembers your budget constraints when you switch to restaurant searches.</p><p><strong>Cross-site synthesis</strong>: The system can simultaneously process multiple sources, comparing information and identifying patterns across everything you have open — something that would take humans dozens of manual steps.</p><p>This isn’t just a faster way to browse. It’s a different paradigm for how humans interact with information online.</p><h3>Three breakthrough discoveries</h3><p>After two weeks of systematic testing, three insights emerged that every UX team needs to understand:</p><p><strong>The mental model shift is instant</strong>: Users adapt to intention-based interfaces within <em>days</em>, not weeks — even when AI only delivers 60–70% reliability</p><p><strong>AI excels where we least expected</strong>: 90% success rate for synthesis tasks vs 30% for linear workflows — most teams are building AI features backwards</p><p><strong>The future is distributed, not monolithic</strong>: Specialized AI services collaborating feel more seamless than one system trying to do everything</p><h3>Day 3: The moment my brain rewired itself</h3><p>The difference is immediate and stark. Traditional browsing: Chrome’s blank page asks “where do I go?” AI-native browsing: Comet’s search field invites “what do I want?”</p><p><strong>My first test:</strong> “Find cheap flights to Tokyo for May, maximum budget $800.”</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*apgdrt0u57htaseGxsZKeQ.png"" /><figcaption>Natural language query replacing traditional navigation: delegating a complex task with multiple constraints.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Traditional approach:</strong></p><ul><li>Open 15+ tabs across multiple flight sites</li><li>Manually compare prices and schedules</li><li>Cross-reference dates and availability</li><li>Time investment: 15–20 minutes of active navigation</li></ul><p><strong>Comet approach:</strong></p><ul><li>Single natural language request</li><li>AI handles research and synthesis automatically</li><li>Time investment: 30 seconds setup + background processing</li></ul><p><strong>The critical insight:</strong> When Comet worked, it was transformative.

I had 8 browser tabs open with diverse UX research from different sources — articles, studies, case studies, forum discussions.</p><p>Command: “Analyze all open tabs and identify common patterns in UX trends for 2025”.</p><figure><img alt=""Comet AI assistant displaying synthesized findings from eight UX research sources, identifying five recurring design trends with specific citations and detecting contradictions between sources in under 60 seconds."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KKcTcLyHaXuifqP19Ki-bQ.png"" /><figcaption>Comet AI assistant displaying synthesized findings from eight UX research sources, identifying five recurring design trends with specific citations and detecting contradictions between sources in under 60 seconds.</figcaption></figure><p>Result in under 60 seconds:<br />→ Analyzed content from 8 diverse sources<br />→ Identified 5 recurring trends with specific citations <br />→ Detected contradictions between sources<br />→ Suggested connections my manual analysis missed<br />→ Success rate: 90%+ reliability</p><p>This was <em>significantly superior</em> to AI’s performance on sequential tasks like booking flights or shopping.</p><p><strong>The Strategic Insight:</strong> AI excels at parallel information processing, not sequential task execution. Framework for teams: Build AI features around analysis and synthesis <em>first</em>. Save execution automation for later iterations when reliability improves.</p><h3>Day 10: Two AIs started talking to each other — without integration</h3><p>The most surprising discovery wasn’t about Comet itself — it was about how AI systems can work together without explicit integration.</p><p>What happened: I asked Perplexity to analyze my travel spending from Gmail. When I switched to Gmail to verify results, Comet Assistant was immediately contextually aware of my travel expense research.</p><p>No API integration required. Both systems maintained “intention persistence” — understanding my underlying goal across platform transitions.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BGEhBQVOqO5HBCy_KYWH6g.png"" /><figcaption>Distributed AI systems collaborating through shared intention context without technical integration.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Critical validation:</strong> Distributed AI collaboration can feel more seamless than monolithic systems. Users benefit from specialized intelligences working together rather than one system attempting everything.</p><h3>Day 12: When delegation actually works</h3><p>By the end of week two, I decided to test Comet with a real-world, high-stakes scenario: planning my daughters’ 11th birthday party. The constraint? They’re celiac, and I needed to shop at Mercadona, a Spanish supermarket.</p><p>My query: “I need to prepare a birthday party for my 11-year-old daughters who are celiac. Help me create a shopping list for Mercadona with all categories: bread, cookies, cakes, candies, and ice cream.”</p><figure><img alt=""Mercadona online store in Comet browser showing initial product search results with AI sidebar providing contextual shopping assistance for gluten-free products suitable for children’s parties"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wj0VeCCdKHIzRjh612c8mA.png"" /><figcaption>Mercadona online store in Comet browser showing initial product search results with AI sidebar providing contextual shopping assistance for gluten-free products suitable for children’s parties.</figcaption></figure><p>What happened next demonstrated the difference between AI that responds and AI that collaborates.</p><p>Instead of dumping a generic list, Comet’s assistant:<br />1. <strong>Understood the constraint</strong> (gluten-free requirement)<br />2. <strong>Maintained context</strong> across multiple product categories<br />3. <strong>Verified availability</strong> in the specific store<br />4. <strong>Built incrementally</strong>, category by category with my approval<br />5. <strong>Executed the outcome</strong>, adding items to my actual cart</p><figure><img alt=""Comet AI organizing gluten-free products by category (snacks, candies, cookies) with real-time availability verification and stepwise user approval"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nNUGK2A9WrVKUNC5y5HmdA.png"" /><figcaption>Comet AI organizing gluten-free products by category (snacks, candies, cookies) with real-time availability verification and stepwise user approval.</figcaption></figure><p>The breakthrough wasn’t speed — it was <strong>control</strong>. At each stage, I could see what the AI was selecting and why. When it found bread options, it explained the selection. When moving to cookies, it remembered the celiac constraint without being reminded.</p><figure><img alt=""Completed Mercadona shopping cart populated by AI assistant with gluten-free birthday party items across all requested categories, totaling €31.32 after stepwise user approval process demonstrating successful task delegation"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pfiIj4bHeRHxx8jONJI1ZQ.png"" /><figcaption>Completed Mercadona shopping cart populated by AI assistant with gluten-free birthday party items across all requested categories, totaling €31.32 after stepwise user approval process demonstrating successful task delegation.</figcaption></figure><p>This is what genuine delegation looks like: I specified the goal, the AI orchestrated the execution, and I maintained meaningful oversight throughout.</p><p><strong>Success rate for this complex, multi-step task: 95%</strong></p><p>The 5% gap? One item suggestion wasn’t available in my postal code, but the AI caught this and offered alternatives before I even clicked checkout.</p><p>This experience crystallized the difference between intention-based and navigation-based interfaces:</p><p><strong>Traditional approach would require:</strong><br />- Manually searching each category<br />- Verifying each product is gluten-free<br />- Cross-referencing availability<br />- Remembering what you already added<br />- 30–45 minutes of active work</p><p><strong>Delegation approach:</strong><br />- Single natural language goal<br />- AI handles research and verification<br />- Stepwise approval of selections<br />- 5 minutes of oversight, 10 minutes of AI work</p><p><strong>Critical insight: Users will tolerate AI reliability issues if they maintain control over outcomes.</strong></p><h3>When the magic broke: Understanding AI failure modes</h3><p>Documenting failures is as important as celebrating successes. But after two weeks of testing, I learned that not all failures are equal — and the distinction matters for design.</p><h4>When AI admits its limits (the good kind of failure)</h4><p>I asked Comet to find hotels in downtown Manhattan within walking distance of Central Park, budget under $200/night for October dates.</p><figure><img alt=""Booking.com hotel search interface in Comet browser with natural language query specifying downtown Manhattan location near Central Park with $200 per night maximum budget constraint for October dates"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TFmmb3pyyaTQCEp82wuNXg.png"" /><figcaption>Hotel search in Comet with explicit constraints: downtown Manhattan, walking distance of Central Park, under $200/night.</figcaption></figure><p>After processing multiple sources, it returned results significantly above my budget — but with crucial transparency:</p><figure><img alt=""Comet browser showing Booking.com hotel search results with transparent failure communication, displaying available Manhattan hotels priced at $463-$1,882 while explaining that no properties meet the $200 budget constraint and offering alternative search parameters"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KmKY4a-4WdIhblrVEmPvqw.png"" /><figcaption>Comet displaying search results with transparent communication about constraint limitations, showing available hotels above budget while explaining why and offering alternatives.</figcaption></figure><p>The AI didn’t fail silently. It acknowledged my constraints, searched comprehensively, and honestly communicated the reality: “There are currently no hotels available in downtown Manhattan within walking distance of Central Park for under $200/night on Booking.com for your dates. Most available properties in this area range from $400-$2,000/night.”</p><p>Then it offered alternatives: expand search radius, adjust budget, or try different dates.</p><p>This is <strong>transparent failure</strong> — the system attempted to fulfill my intention, couldn’t, and explained why with actionable options. Crucially, user trust remains intact because the AI showed its reasoning.</p><h4>When AI fails silently (the dangerous kind)</h4><p>Real trust destroyers look different. These are failures where AI confidently delivers wrong results without signaling uncertainty:</p><p><strong>Silent execution failures I documented:</strong><br />- Grocery queries returning “cilantro seeds” instead of “fresh cilantro”<br />- Flight bookings with incorrect date interpretations<br />- Multi-constraint searches that quietly ignore specific criteria<br />- Location parameters that get deprioritized without explanation</p><p>The pattern: AI appears confident while being incorrect. No warning signals. No acknowledgment of limitations. Just wrong results presented as right ones.</p><p><strong>The design implication:</strong> AI systems must distinguish between “I can’t fulfill this request” and “I fulfilled this request incorrectly.”</p><p>The first builds trust through honesty and explanation. <br />The second destroys trust through false confidence.</p><p>For UX designers: Design for graceful failure acknowledgment, not just graceful success paths. The quality of your error states determines long-term user trust more than the quality of your success states.</p><h4>Performance and security considerations</h4><p>Beyond functional reliability, Comet faces technical challenges that affect real-world viability:</p><p><strong>Performance: </strong>Noticeably slower than Chrome for basic browsing tasks, particularly on initial page loads and when processing multiple tabs simultaneously.</p><p><strong>Security:</strong> <a href=""https://brave.com/blog/comet-prompt-injection/"">Brave researchers documented prompt injection vulnerabilities</a> in Comet’s architecture, revealing attack vectors unique to AI-native browsers that traditional security models don’t address. As AI becomes infrastructure rather than feature, new security paradigms become necessary.</p><p>These aren’t dealbreakers — they’re growing pains of a new category. But they’re important context for teams considering similar architectures.</p><h3>The new metrics you need to track</h3><p>Traditional engagement metrics miss the fundamental shift. In AI-native interfaces, success depends on the system, not the user. Track these instead:</p><ul><li><strong>Intention success rate</strong>: Does the user’s goal get accomplished?</li><li><strong>Delegation trust index</strong>: How quickly users trust AI with different tasks</li><li><strong>Intention continuity rate</strong>: How well user intent persists across platform transitions</li></ul><h3>The threshold that will reshape everything</h3><p>Based on systematic analysis: <strong>Traditional navigation interfaces will feel cognitively primitive to users who have experienced genuine delegation — the question isn’t if, but how quickly this threshold is reached.</strong></p><p><strong>Supporting evidence</strong>: Users adapt to intention-based paradigms within days, but current AI can only reliably deliver on those intentions 60–70% of the time. This creates a unique design challenge — bridging transformed user expectations with current technological limitations.</p><p><strong>Industry implication:</strong> Companies should focus on AI interoperability and intention continuity rather than building comprehensive AI monoliths. The competitive advantage lies in orchestrating collaborative AI ecosystems, not singular super-systems.</p><h4>What changes Monday morning</h4><p><strong>→ Start with synthesis, not automation</strong><br />Build AI features around information processing first</p><p><strong>→ Map intention flows, not user flows </strong><br />Design for delegation, with traditional navigation as fallback</p><p><strong>→ Design trust incrementally</strong><br />Prove reliability in low-stakes scenarios first</p><p><strong>→ Build graceful degradation</strong><br />Clear pathways back when AI fails</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>Comet represents the first complete empirical validation of theoretical AI UX principles. More importantly, it revealed that the future lies not in monolithic AI systems, but in specialized services collaborating to create unified user experiences.</p><p><strong>For UX designers:</strong> The shift from navigation to intention is operational, not theoretical. Start designing intention flows that span multiple AI systems.</p><p><strong>For product managers:</strong> “Intention Continuity Rate” may be more predictive of success than traditional engagement metrics.</p><p><strong>For the industry:</strong> Early implementation of ecosystem-level AI collaboration provides competitive advantage over isolated AI features.</p><p>The paradigm shift is happening whether our technology is ready or not. The question isn’t whether to participate — it’s whether you’ll lead the transition or follow it.</p><h4><strong>References and further reading:</strong></h4><p><a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/comet"">Perplexity Comet Browser</a><br /><a href=""https://brave.com/blog/comet-prompt-injection/"">Brave Security Research: Agentic Browser Security</a><br /><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mental-models/"">Mental Models in UX Design — Nielsen Norman Group</a><br /><a href=""https://www.starburst.io/blog/parallel-vs-sequential-processing/"">Parallel vs Sequential Processing in Computing</a><br /><a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2501.06322v1"">Multi-Agent Collaboration Mechanisms in AI</a><br /><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266730532300056X"">Distributed AI Systems: Taxonomy and Framework</a><br /><a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/human-computer-interaction"">Human-Computer Interaction Design Principles</a></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=d7a702529a4a"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/what-perplexitys-ai-browser-reveals-about-ux-s-future-d7a702529a4a"">What Perplexity’s AI browser reveals about UX’s future</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<p>Journey mapping is one of the most widely used tools in interactive design, helping us create products and campaigns that connect with users on a deeper emotional level. This is key to building long-term loyalty, where users and customers feel an irrational sense of trust and gratitude toward your brand.</p><p>In this article, I’ll explain what an emotional journey is to give you a strategic perspective on how we use emotional design to shape user experiences. Then we’ll explore the 12 major emotional journeys, helping you better understand the different types of transitions that motivate and reinforce user behavior. This will give you — and potentially your colleagues — a shared set of terms for describing emotional journeys, making it easier to discuss and debate design strategies.</p><p>Finally, we’ll look at a new wave of color science that explores the link between color and motivation, so you can use color more strategically to strike the right emotional tone.</p><h3>Cugelman emotion map</h3><p>We’re going to use the Cugelman Emotion Map to explain each of the emotional transitions and look at them strategically, so let’s start with an overview. I developed the Emotion Map in the Behavioral Design Academy as a model based on neuroscience and psychology of emotion, that I simplified to help designers apply science-based emotional design strategies.</p><p>In this article, I’ll give you an overview of the Map, then we’ll step up and use the model to understand the bigger picture in emotional design. If you’d like to explore it in more detail, here’s a deeper explanation: <a href=""https://www.behavioraldesign.academy/color-psychology/colors-and-emotions"">https://www.behavioraldesign.academy/color-psychology/colors-and-emotions</a></p><p>The Cugelman Emotion Map divides emotional experience into four quadrants — each representing one of the broad emotional states that either motivate or reinforce people’s behavior.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*EkCIV2xWRiLE_SaU.png"" /></figure><h3>Motivators vs. reinforcers</h3><p>People often confuse the terms <em>motivator</em> with <em>reinforcer</em> — and while they’re closely related, they’re actually two distinct psychological principles that we use in different ways.</p><p>You can usually tell when someone doesn’t understand the difference because they use the term <em>“carrot and stick”</em> inconsistently — sometimes as a motivator, other times as a reinforcer — without realizing they’re blending two separate principles. This kind of confusion can seriously harm their design and communication work.</p><p>It’s hard to apply psychology effectively when you mix up the most fundamental principles. So let’s make sure we’re clear on the difference.</p><ul><li>Motivators are design strategies that evoke excitement or fear about a future outcome. We use the term motivator to describe how emotional design can spark a desire to act — either to gain something desirable (which evokes an optimistic emotion) or avoid something unpleasant (that evokes an insecure emotion).</li><li>Reinforcers, on the other hand, are design strategies that deliver an emotionally rewarding or painful experience in the present. These aren’t about driving action, but about reinforcing behavior — shaping user habits by encouraging repetition of something rewarding, and discouraging of things that feel painful or frustrating.</li></ul><p>Let’s contrast these a bit more.</p><p>Motivators are emotions that drive people to take action. Reinforcers, on the other hand, are the emotional rewards or punishments that shape how people behave over time — determining whether they’ll repeat a behavior or avoid it in the future.</p><p>Motivators reflect the energizing emotional response to an anticipated threat someone wants to avoid, or an opportunity they hope to obtain. Reinforcers describe the emotional experience based on what we achieved — whether it’s a positive emotion tied to success, which boosts the odds of repeating the behavior, or a negative emotion tied to failure, which teaches us to try harder or adopt a different approach.</p><p>While motivators inspire us to act, reinforcers teach us how to act.</p><p>Since emotions can be used both to motivate and to reinforce user behavior, understanding how they work gives us a more strategic way to design emotional experiences.</p><p>Let’s look at each quadrant in the Cugelman Emotion Map to better understand how these emotions function, and then we’ll build on this, by exploring the 12 transitions and colors psychology of each quadrant.</p><h3>Motivators (Green quadrants)</h3><p>In the Cugelman Emotion Map, the two motivator quadrants are shown in green, representing go. These are the areas where we people feel motivated to act — either by creating opportunities drive their optimism, or threats that drive their feelings of insecurity. Here’s an explanation of each:</p><ul><li><strong>Optimistic (High energy, positive emotion):</strong> This is where excitement, curiosity, and engagement live. These emotions drive focus, approach and movement towards the goal. Strategically, this is where we showcase incentives, highlight product value, and aim to satisfy our users’ needs. If you don’t offer enough to evoke these emotions, your product will feel unmotivating but if you overdo it, you may come across as selling too hard.</li><li><strong>Insecure (High energy, negative emotion):</strong> These are the stress emotions, with anxiety, worry or a sense of pressure. Strategically, we may use urgency, FOMO, or any of many threat avoidance strategies to drive action. However, this must be used carefully — too much can feel manipulative, overly negative, or stressful. Think of it like a spice: just a dash can be effective, but too much is overwhelming.</li></ul><h3>Reinforcers (Red quadrants)</h3><p>The two reinforcer quadrants are shown in red. These reflect the emotional experiences users feel after taking action — either a rewarding or painful experience.</p><ul><li><strong>Secure (Low energy, positive emotion):</strong> Users feel calm, trusting, and satisfied. Strategically, this is where we want users to land — feeling confident that our product consistently meets their needs. This is the emotional zone where we build long-term loyalty which is often the key to designing a successful product. The downside here, is users can start to feel complacent and start to disengage once they get what they thought they wanted.</li><li><strong>Pessimistic (Low energy, negative emotion):</strong> This is where users feel disappointed, trapped, or helpless. It signals disengagement and the risk of churn. But these emotions are potentially dangerous. If users stay here too long, this is the zone where resentment can form. Resentment is the opposite of loyalty, where people will never trust your company and may go out of their way to harm your reputation and income. Never leave users stuck in this state for long, unless you enjoy responding to nasty comments on social media. The up side is that if your competitors trap users in this quadrant, you can easily poach them.</li></ul><p>This gives us a basic overview of the Cugelman Emotion Map, so let’s move on to the strategic use of these emotions.</p><h3>User journeys are emotional transitions</h3><p>Years ago, I became interested in writing screenplays and read several classic books on the subject — including Aristotle’s Poetics. This 2,000-year-old classic analyzes theater and explains how stories resonate with audiences.</p><p>While reading it, I sketched out a diagram of a play, as a timeline with a curve representing the emotional tone. It rises toward high positivity, then dips into lower negativity over time — similar to how we compose music, shifting between moments of high and low tension.</p><p>Years later, I discovered that Kurt Vonnegut had used a similar framework to analyze the narrative arcs of literature — possibly also inspired by Aristotle. I also came across a scientific paper that used AI to analyze the plot structures of numerous books, using the same emotional diagram.</p><p>I’ve adapted this concept into the Cugelman Emotion Map, which we’ll use to understand the rise and fall of emotional tension as part of our emotional design strategies.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*wSX89it6UbKAdh-W.png"" /></figure><p>To show you how it works, let’s walk through a classic love story — between a frustrated user and an online product that steps in as the hero, solves their problem, and ultimately earns their long-term loyalty. In the chart below, you’ll see how each transition (in the Emotion Map) places our user in one emotional state before and another right after.</p><p>In this story, our user begins in a state of contentment but soon realizes they have a problem. They try to solve it, fail, and gradually sink into a sense of despair — feeling hopeless and ready to give up on finding a solution.</p><p>Then they discover your product, which sparks a sense of renewed optimism. They decide to give it a try. Your product delivers on its promises, and as the user starts to experience real benefits, their trust in your product and brand begins to grow.</p><p>If we continue to reinforce their trust by consistently delivering on our promises, the user may eventually feel something even more powerful: gratitude and the greatest prize of all — their loyalty. At this point, they’re not just satisfied; they’re emotionally invested.</p><h3>The 12 emotional journeys</h3><p>Based on the four quadrants, there are 12 primary emotional journeys that represent every possible transition across the motivators and reinforcers.</p><p>These transitions can happen quickly, but they can also unfold over a much longer period — sometimes taking months or even years — as people gradually shift from one emotional state to another. For example, someone might spend years feeling pessimistic about their life before something changes and they find a new way forward.</p><p>To help you better understand these patterns, below is an overview of all twelve emotional journeys, including one in-depth example for each quadrant.</p><h3>Optimism strategies</h3><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*snfgPZ8BVlKRcnKJ.png"" /></figure><p>These are the most positive emotional transitions, where users pursue a goal as we support them. If your only aim is to get users to take a single action, one optimistic motivational strategy may be enough. However, in most cases, we use these strategies to prompt initial action, then we start focusing on the secure quadrant, where we work to build a long-term, repeat relationship.</p><p>That said, optimistic emotions are the primary tool we use to get people started. Below are three common emotional journeys:</p><ul><li><strong>Inspiring: </strong>Our audience is already content with their current situation, but by offering something truly exciting, they feel that things can go from good to great. This is how we fire up their excitement to leave their place of comfort.</li><li><strong>Incentivizing: </strong>Our audience feels pressure to avoid an imminent threat while progressively feeling optimistic that their course of action will help them avoid the threat and gain benefits. At some point, the positives outweigh the negatives, leaving our audience more positive about the experience.</li><li><strong>Liberating: </strong>Our audience feels trapped in a hopeless position, but when we provide the promise of escape or change for the better, pessimistic despair fades in favor of optimistic hope.</li></ul><h4>Credit Karma aims to inspire users</h4><p>Users often settle when their credit score is “good enough” and stop thinking about improving. This is a common challenge in behavioral design. Once people reach a goal, they tend to disengage — and that’s often when we see them regress, too.</p><p>While the ultimate goal of behavior change is usually long-term loyalty in the secure quadrant, once people reach this point, we typically need to shift towards maintenance strategies to keep them regular. Credit Karma uses mainly inspiring tactics, motivating users with positivity and encouraging continued progress through uplifting, goal-oriented messages. Yes, there is a slight dash of implied fear messaging, but overall, this is far more positive than negative, with a nice calming blue.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*18xFzXplwELrcFT_.png"" /></figure><h3>Insecurity strategies</h3><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*VKbAovXJ9cUFVRJM.png"" /></figure><p>This quadrant involves using stress-arousing techniques that motivate our audience to move in the right direction or stop them from heading the wrong way. I recommend including at least a small dose of these techniques consistently. However, it’s important not to overdo them, as they can backfire when misapplied. Here are the three transitions:</p><ul><li><strong>Pressuring</strong> — Our audience is moving toward something positive, but then realizes there’s an emerging threat. Their current path becomes more attractive because it will also help them avoid this imminent danger.</li><li><strong>Agitating</strong> — Our audience feels secure at first, but their contentment turns to stress as an emerging threat slowly takes over, dominating their thoughts and leaving them feeling they must act urgently.</li><li><strong>Scaring</strong> — Our audience feels trapped in an emotionally painful situation and then experiences growing anxiety to act urgently to avoid an imminent threat they may feel powerless to escape. This is an extremely stressful and punishing transition, but a mainstay of political communications.</li></ul><h4>Booking.com pressures customers with threats</h4><p>Booking makes you feel optimistic that you’ll be able to get the room you want, but then they layer-on classic pressure tactics by telling you that others are booking that same room right now, forcing you from the solidarity of your safe bedroom to a public space where you’re now competing to not lose that room.</p><p>They use their friendly colors in combination with some alarming red, warning you that you’d better act or risk losing that sweet deal. You can read more about <a href=""https://www.behavioraldesign.academy/blog/7-principles-of-social-influence-for-digital-psychology"">booking.com’s social influence strategies here</a>.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*Mko_D70CMOWAj3Z_.jpg"" /></figure><p>A common technique is to make users aware that if they don’t act someone else will get it first, forcing them into a competitive, zero-sum game they never intended to play. Booking.com is famous for this, with this example showing how they’re telling me other people are booking this property now. They really turn up the heat later when I reach the booking page, telling me someone else will get the room if I dare close the page.</p><h3>Security strategies</h3><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*Dayib-OvNDWiAkPB.png"" /></figure><p>For most of what we do, this quadrant represents the ultimate goal of emotional design: fostering long-term, loyal relationships with our target audience.</p><p>When I say <em>loyalty</em>, I don’t mean repeat habits. I’m talking about something deeper — when your audience forms an emotional bond with your brand and starts acting in ways that don’t always make logical sense. They’ll resist switching to competitors even when better deals are available, and some may even feel like they’re “cheating” on your brand because their loyalty feels authentic. These are also the people who often become brand advocates and drive referrals.</p><p>However, the downside of bringing people into this secure quadrant is that they can become complacent. This is why we typically shift into <em>maintenance psychology</em> once our audience reaches this stage.</p><p>Below are the three main ways we bring people into the secure quadrant:</p><ul><li><strong>Gratifying</strong> — Our audience is pursuing something truly motivating, which is fulfilling enough that they feel secure in their ability to achieve it or trust those who provide it — ideally our brand. This is the most satisfying and rewarding experience, the place where trust and loyalty are nurtured, as our audience feels compelled to rep</li><li><strong>Relieving</strong> — Our audience is actively working to avoid an imminent threat, and then discovers a solution that may not excite them but solves the problem, leading them to feel relaxed and secure as tension fades into relief.</li><li><strong>Saving</strong> — Our audience feels trapped in a painful situation but then discovers a solution that may not have seemed exciting yet lifts them from their plight, leaving them feeling secure and filled with deep gratitude.</li></ul><h4>Zappos gratifies its customers</h4><p>Zappos has earned one of the top reputations for phenomenal customer support — and they’ve clearly learned a critical lesson: when customers are pursuing a goal, the company must help them achieve it and never leave them feeling trapped with a product they don’t want or a transaction they consider unfair.</p><p>What’s impressive about their site is how easy it is to find the support page. Not only does it offer a straightforward way to return products, but contacting the company is also straightforward. Compare that to many other companies, where contact info is buried in the footer or hidden behind a bizarre maze of frustrating, nonsensical complexity.</p><p>And when you call that number, you discover how Zappos truly gratifies customers and earns loyalty: by offering support staff who weren’t hired just for competence, but equally for their deeply empathetic personalities.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*lSj9wqDiBVRC14PS.png"" /></figure><h3>Pessimism strategies</h3><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*R0ph0d6pV6qLVWv6.png"" /></figure><p>The last quadrant is the most negative — and the riskiest to work with — as it deals with our most disheartening emotions. Unlike the secure emotions that build loyalty, this quadrant is where self-hate or long-term resentment toward your brand can take root — the exact opposite of what we want to achieve.</p><p>Users can end up here intentionally, through sadistic design, or more commonly, through simple incompetence. Despite this, there are situations where it’s necessary to take users into this space — for example, when they haven’t paid their bills or we have to close an unprofitable product that people depend on. Whether you’re in damage control mode or trying to turn a bad experience into a positive one, it’s critical to understand these emotions and how they function.</p><p>The upside is that when your competitors have driven their users into this quadrant, they’re ripe for defection. All you need to do is step in as the savior, with a product that makes people feel optimistic that it’s time to try something new.</p><p>Here are the three main ways users end up in pessimistic emotional states:</p><ul><li><strong>Overwhelming: </strong>Our audience tries to avoid a threat, but when escape proves impossible, they experience the consequences directly and find themselves trapped in helplessness.</li><li><strong>Discontenting: </strong>Our audience once felt secure, but as their sense of safety erodes, they begin to feel pessimistic, finding themselves trapped in an emotionally punishing situation.</li><li><strong>Disappointing: </strong>Our audience was pursuing an exciting opportunity, only to end up worse off, where hope turns to disappointment and they feel trapped in an awful situation.</li></ul><h4>Temu’s overwhelming wheel of hell</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/406/0*XuBOZoIycWuOMOou.png"" /></figure><p>Temu earns the award for having one of the most frustrating web interfaces that overwhelms users. Instead of allowing people to use their mobile website freely, they aggressively push users toward their mobile app using a manipulative design pattern.</p><p>When you search for products on their mobile web interface, a spinning gambling-wheel pops up, forcing you to play a fake game, win a misleading prize, and then pressuring you to download their app to not lose it.</p><p>If you don’t download the app, the same popup keeps appearing whenever you return to the search results page — making the site far too frustrating to use. On the other hand, if you download the app, you risk installing potential spyware linked to the Chinese Communist Party. Either way, you lose.</p><p>So to get their low prices, you must pay the real price — stress or privacy risks — and each sucks. So the only real choice is not to use their product and assume there’s a hidden cost to their deals.</p><h3>Colors of emotional journeys</h3><p>When it comes to visual design strategies during transitions, color psychology can be a powerful tool for amplifying emotional tone. But before diving in, let’s clear up a few common misunderstandings.</p><h3>Universal color-emotion claims are usually nonsense</h3><p>First, many of the so-called magical links between color and emotion are largely nonsense — ideas invented, recycled, and repeated over time. The design industry has long had a quiet love affair with color pseudoscience, but that approach is becoming increasingly outdated.</p><p>Today, a new wave of research in color psychology and neuroscience is uncovering real, scientifically supported connections between color and emotion. The problem is that much of this knowledge remains buried in academic papers. That’s why I, along with many others, am working to make this research more accessible.</p><h3>Color-emotion associations are context-specific</h3><p>Second, color–emotion associations are real, but they’re context dependent. This means color must always be evaluated within the situation it’s being used. When color and context align, emotional impact is amplified. When they don’t, your message can be weakened and the user experience disrupted. This principle is called <a href=""https://www.behavioraldesign.academy/blog/color-in-context-theory-extended"">color-in-context theory</a>.</p><p>When any color matches the emotional tone of the context, psychologists call this color congruency. A mismatch creates incongruency, a subtle but jarring feeling that makes it hard for people to understand what’s going on, while also eroding trust.</p><p>For example, if you’re shopping and see a red sticker on jeans you’ve been eyeing, you may feel excited — red signals a sale. But if you’re a crypto trader and see a red candlestick on a chart, your heart might sink — red signals a financial loss. In one case, red feels positive; in the other, negative. The emotional response comes not from the color itself, but from what it means in that specific context.</p><p>This is why blanket statements like “red means danger” or “blue means calm” are misleading. What truly matters is color authenticity — choosing colors that accurately reflect the emotional context, rather than applying assumed meanings arbitrarily.</p><p>When color and context are congruent, design becomes more emotionally resonant and persuasive. When mismatched, it creates friction.</p><p>Congruent colors also enhance cognitive fluency — users process information more quickly, trust the experience more, and are more likely to accept the message. Incongruent colors slow processing, raise skepticism, and prompt users to scrutinize more carefully — not always in a good way.</p><h3>Color-emotion associations are rooted in facial perception</h3><p>Third, if color-emotion associations aren’t magical, where do they come from?</p><p>The common explanation points to culture. While cultural meaning plays a role, growing research suggests a deeper origin: our ability to read emotional cues from facial color changes.</p><p>Babies can identify five basic colors — purple, blue, green, yellow, and red — the same hues our brains use to interpret emotional signals in faces. While cultural learning shapes these associations over time, the foundational training begins in infancy. Across all cultures, humans learn to associate certain facial color patterns with specific emotional states in specific contexts.</p><p>Context matters here, too. If someone apologizes but doesn’t blush, you might doubt their sincerity. What you call “intuition” could be your brain registering the absence of a familiar emotional color pattern. Similarly, we judge health based on skin tone. A greenish hue might suggest illness to you; to a doctor, it could signal a specific condition.</p><p>Here’s how it works: Our faces emit subtle color patterns based on blood oxygenation. Oxygenated blood creates red tones; deoxygenated blood creates blue ones. These combine into distinct facial color signatures for different emotions — and they’re visible across all skin tones. People of all ethnicities are able to detect these shifts within their communities, regardless of melanin levels. This appears to be a universal human trait.</p><p>These signals are so consistent that researchers have developed video algorithms capable of estimating heartbeat and emotional state based on facial color shifts. When people view the color masks generated by these systems, they’re surprisingly accurate at guessing emotional states — further validating the theory that facial color cues underpin emotional perception.</p><p>While cultural influence is real, our lifelong training to read facial color changes is likely the strongest source of our color-emotion associations.</p><h3>We project facial-color emotions to non-human things</h3><p>Fourth, research suggests that we unconsciously project facial color associations onto inanimate objects.</p><p>Humans are pathological anthropomorphizers — we assign human traits to animals, machines, and even lifeless objects. The fact that a “pet rock” can have a personality says it all.</p><p>We don’t just see a color — we interpret it through the lens of human emotion. That’s why a blue couch might feel “calm,” or a red button might feel “urgent.” We’re unconsciously applying the same facial color-emotion patterns we’ve observed in people to everything around us.</p><p>In a 2018 study, Thorstenson and colleagues asked participants to match objects, facial expressions, and emotions with different colors. While the match wasn’t perfect, in the chart below, you’ll see there was a strikingly close fit — supporting the idea that our general color-emotion associations originate from the emotional color patterns we first learned by observing our parents’ emotions, and their facial signals.</p><h3>Color contexts of the emotional quadrants</h3><p>Because color-emotion links rely on authentic, context-specific use of color, I’ve merged findings from a wide range of scientific studies and mapped them to the Cugelman Emotion Map. This framework includes major motivational contexts behind emotional experience — such as physiological wellbeing, safety, social bonding, status, and reproductive instincts (love, sex, parenting).</p><p>We won’t go into the full details here, just the high-level emotional tones used for motivating and reinforcing behavior.</p><p>This framework gives us a basic color palette that congruently amplifies the emotional tone across the “12 Journeys” users take as they transition from one emotional state to another.</p><p>Here’s a high-level overview of the emotional color quadrants:</p><ul><li><strong>Optimistic-to-pessimistic emotions: </strong>These range from vibrant rainbow hues in the optimistic quadrant to desaturated gray tones in the pessimistic quadrant.</li><li><strong>Insecure-to-secure emotions:</strong> These range from red, oxygenated blood tones in the insecure quadrant to calm, blue-appearing blood tones in the secure quadrant.</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/708/0*uaOgRvIC0E8M3pJx.png"" /></figure><h3>Optimistic-to-pessimistic emotions: Desaturated to saturated colors</h3><p>When exploring the motivational context of emotional quadrants, certain key colors do emerge; however, the general rule centers on saturation. A well-known study found that among the range of optimistic and pessimistic emotions, one pattern stood out: optimistic emotions are strongly associated with saturated, vivid colors — the kind seen in children’s programming or rainbow imagery. These colors tend to feel more exciting and energetic.</p><p>By contrast, colors tied to pessimistic emotions become increasingly desaturated, often fading toward gray. These muted tones reflect a loss of vitality and align with feelings of decline, detachment, or emotional fatigue.</p><p>A classic example is the “before and after” narrative often used in marketing. The “before” scene typically features dull, desaturated tones — representing a life that’s uninspired or unfulfilled. The “after” scene bursts into vibrant, saturated color, instantly signaling emotional uplift and positivity.</p><h4>Optimistic colors</h4><p>Optimistic colors span the full spectrum but tend to lean toward warmer tones. As a general rule, a diverse palette of saturated, vibrant hues conveys positivity and emotional energy.</p><p>Research from human facial studies shows that red is associated with competitiveness, athletic performance, dominance, and social status. As red shifts toward yellow-orange, it begins to signal health and even sexual attractiveness — patterns commonly observed in facial color and dating studies.</p><p>That said, red’s emotional meaning shifts radically depending on context. While it can be used for optimistic emotions, I typically avoid it as a strategic designer due to its potential to send mixed signals. In positive contexts, I minimize its use, reserving it primarily for insecure emotions where it carries more weight.</p><p>The general guideline is clear: use a vibrant, colorful palette to represent optimistic positivity, but be selective about how and when red is applied.</p><h4>Pessimistic colors</h4><p>Pessimistic emotions are best expressed through desaturated tones — colors that appear faded, aged, or washed out. As hues lose saturation, they naturally drift toward gray, mirroring emotional states such as sadness, depletion, or disconnection.</p><p>In fact, the link between gray and depression is so strong it runs both ways. People experiencing depression often perceive the world as more gray and tend to apply filters to their Instagram photos that appear bluer, darker, and grayer.</p><p>Some hues carry specific negative connotations. For instance: Green is often linked to illness and has been shown to reduce perceived attractiveness in dating studies. Greenish-yellow can signal disgust — which makes sense, as it’s a visible indicator of serious, potentially life-threatening health conditions. Red can suggest blushing, embarrassment, or shame. Blue is closely associated with sadness.</p><p>I generally avoid red and blue in pessimistic contexts, keeping them for more sharply defined emotional contrasts elsewhere in the palette. But if you do use them, desaturate them in depressive or low-energy contexts to maintain emotional accuracy.</p><h3>Insecure-to-secure emotions: Red-blooded to blue tones</h3><p>Facial coloration offers one of the clearest explanations for our color-emotion associations. Specifically, it’s the interplay between oxygenated red veins and deoxygenated blue arteries that produces the wide range of facial colors linked to different emotional states.</p><p>While specific motivational contexts bring their own colors, the broad trend is a shift from red to blue across the insecure-to-secure spectrum.</p><p>A classic example can be found in warnings, alerts, and system messages, which almost always use red to signal urgency or threat. On the other hand, websites that aim to reassure users — such as those handling transactions or personal data — often use baby blues, soft gradients, and calming skies to convey security and trust.</p><h4>Insecure colors</h4><p>In states of insecurity — when people feel vulnerable, anxious, or threatened — red becomes a dominant color. It’s consistently linked to perceptions of aggression and arousal, though the exact meaning depends heavily on context. A flushed face might indicate hostility in a confrontation, or attraction in a romantic moment.</p><p>Because red is emotionally intense and highly context-sensitive, I reserve it primarily for anxious or threat-based emotions, using it strategically and sparingly in other areas.</p><p>Darker tones can also express the intensity of insecurity — leaning more toward deep black rather than neutral gray. These hues add weight and contrast, especially in high-impact or “reverse” palettes. Greenish-brown also fits into this emotional range, often signaling disgust or contempt and reinforcing the darker, more defensive aspects of insecurity.</p><h4>Secure colors</h4><p>Lower blood oxygenation is associated with relaxed, stable emotional states, which are often reflected in blue-to-purple hues, with some slight extensions into red. These tones evoke calm, trust, contentment, and emotional stability — qualities tied to low arousal and composure.</p><p>As emotional activation increases slightly, emotions like admiration or appreciation begin to shift toward subtly warmer tones within the same spectrum. Still, I usually keep these emotions within the bluish palette, as it best conveys the ease, connection, and quiet assurance of trust.</p><h3>Final words</h3><p>I hope this article offered a fresh perspective on color psychology and sparked some new ideas for how you might apply it to your own projects.</p><p>I’m sharing this as a test of the structure for a book I’m currently publishing on the topic. If you have any feedback on the format — whether you found it helpful or see areas for improvement — I’d genuinely appreciate hearing it.</p><p>Enjoy the journey.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/120/1*n_39MynndCiz3GwGQPKfRg.png"" /><figcaption>Brian Cugelman</figcaption></figure><h3>Meet the author</h3><p>Dr. Brian Cugelman is a specialist in using psychology and data science for digital products.</p><p>Thousands of students from companies like Samsung, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, and Salesforce have completed his digital psychology training.</p><p>He has authored over 25 publications and spoken at MIT, the University of Toronto, Johns Hopkins, and various conferences, including TEDx.</p><p>Dr. Cugelman leads the Behavioral Design Academy, offering training on applying psychology to technology.

<h4>How AI redefines user interfaces, and why the chat box gets it wrong</h4><figure><img alt=""A person typing on a vintage tablet prototype, overlaid with a modern AI search bar."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fdhCb8tb0yzs0zFG8Rropg.png"" /><figcaption>Image source: <a href=""https://kokonautlabs.wordpress.com/2013/02/27/alan-kay-on-marshal-mcluhan-and-the-personal-computer/"">Kokonaut Labs</a> / Recreated by author</figcaption></figure><p>In 1989, Alan Kay published <a href=""https://worrydream.com/refs/Kay_1989_-_User_Interface,_a_Personal_View.pdf""><em>User Interface: A Personal View</em></a>, building on Marshall McLuhan’s idea that <a href=""https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/mcluhan.mediummessage.pdf""><strong>“the medium is the message.”</strong></a> A medium doesn’t just carry information, it reshapes how we think. To make sense of it, we first internalize the medium.</p><p><strong>An interface, then, is a cognitive framework.</strong></p><p>Today, AI interfaces are shifting fast: from chat to voice, from canvases to agent-driven cross-tool spaces. As models converge in capability, the real differentiation has moved to the interface layer. The interface is no longer just a channel. It is the key that unlocks technology, translating complexity into affordances and shaping the flow of human attention.</p><h3>The collapse of interaction</h3><p>Before large language models, our typical path to finding answers online looked something like this: break your question down into keywords (like pizza, recipe, tutorial) and feed them to a search engine.</p><p>Then you wade through a long list of results, browsing page by page, clicking on a few promising links to read carefully, and finally mentally stitching those fragments together into your own version of the answer.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram comparing command-based, process-driven, and AI-driven intent-based interfaces through Google and Perplexity examples."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-VaSvfujeqbYtSkUzrczRQ.png"" /></figure><p>In contrast, with conversational AI products, I simply say: “Give me the perfect pizza recipe and instructions,” and the AI immediately serves up a curated answer. If it’s not quite right, I add a couple more sentences, the AI continues to refine or rewrite, and soon I’ve iterated to a final answer.</p><p>So with AI’s intervention, we can see two major shifts in product interaction paradigms:</p><h4><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-paradigm/"">From command-based to intent-based</a></h4><p>Traditional interfaces relied on a turn-taking loop: <strong>input → output → user judgment → next command.</strong> Now, instead of issuing step-by-step instructions, the user states the goal, and the system handles the process behind the scenes.</p><h4>From process-driven to outcome-driven</h4><p>Interaction used to feel like a visible journey, where users accumulated knowledge and built judgment along the way. Today, much of that process is folded into the backend. Interaction becomes a cycle of prompting and refining around the result itself. The user’s main task is to evaluate the output, while the system dynamically connects the dots based on intent.</p><h3>The unmoored chat box</h3><p>Interestingly, most AI products have converged on the same choice: a chat box. The reason is obvious — chat feels natural, with virtually zero learning curve. Prompts unfold as back-and-forth conversation, offering high interactivity, tolerance for errors, low barriers to entry, and almost unlimited flexibility. It’s the perfect vehicle for mass adoption.</p><figure><img alt=""Grid showing six AI chat interfaces, including ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, DeepSeek, and Grok, all sharing similar layouts."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Uyp3cUr0RbKUIwfIUOBUoQ.png"" /></figure><p>This is why Sam Altman wants to build ChatGPT into a <a href=""https://youtu.be/ctcMA6chfDY?si=WLb9A244XcdJmTnT"">Personal Life OS</a>.

The same intent, placed in slightly different contexts, can produce different results. Therefore, ensuring that a setting always corresponds to stable, reproducible effects is a thankless task.</p><p>As a result, AI products often bury parameters deep in the system instead of exposing them as explicit controls.</p><figure><img alt=""Composite interface mockup showing an AI tool presenting maps, videos, product listings, and charts in one unified workspace."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aNaUD3ArHvj-QxGZJuMiOw.png"" /></figure><p>Take ChatGPT as an example. Beyond plain text, it can also produce tables, images, charts, code snippets, videos, and content cards.</p><p>One way to unlock these formats is to be explicit in the prompt — say, asking the AI to present the answer as a flowchart. But this puts the burden back on the user, who now has to master structured prompting and understand how content should align with different formats.</p><p>The second is to let the AI decide, having the system choose the appropriate presentation based on the generated content’s characteristics. This points to a major trend in future interfaces — <a href=""https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/generative-user-interfaces?_sm_vck=J8qN47SpWnMDrN8LSrDW9NkMQHB0Q8RH7DJrRRslW9447Q7sqsRN"">Generative UI</a>.</p><p>In this model, AI doesn’t just generate content, it simultaneously decides and renders the most fitting presentation container, truly merging output with interface for genuine personalization.</p><p>But before Generative UI becomes reality, the chat box stays out of control.</p><h3>Category error</h3><p>Dave Edwards, founder of <a href=""https://artificialityinstitute.org/"">Artificiality</a>, offered a thought-provoking <a href=""https://artificialityinstitute.org/the-design-illusion-of-llms/"">metaphor</a> that most digital products fall into one of two categories:</p><p><strong>Windows</strong>: they connect users to external information and resources — think Tripadvisor, Airbnb, or Spotify.</p><p><strong>Rooms</strong>: they provide spaces for work, collaboration, and creation — tools like Figma, Photoshop, or PowerPoint.</p><figure><img alt=""Comparison between Figma and Tripadvisor interfaces illustrating two tool metaphors: “room” for exploration and “window” for creation."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nU3L_X_hnCmYOBNsZIHJmA.png"" /></figure><p>If we map AI users along a proficiency spectrum: there are beginners, intermediate users, and power users.</p><p>Conversational interfaces naturally cater to the first two groups.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937924.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>At first, Sandra Campos hesitated about joining the TikTok trend taking over her feed. In the five years since immigration officers had dropped her off at <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/latine-border-stories-art-joy"">the Mexican border</a>, she had chosen to keep her life-altering <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/puerto-rico-ice-raids-protests"">deportation story</a> off of her social media page, fearing rejection. </p>



<p>But as deportation videos multiplied across social media platforms under President Donald Trump’s second administration, she found that deportees, like herself, were picking up their phones and telling their side of the story. In May, she joined the trend with a playful, 6-second clip.</p>



<p><a href=""https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSUrXrQBx/"">In the video</a>, Campos whips her long hair in disbelief. The on-screen text reads: “When you get deported after living in the U.S. for 20+ years and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/05/10971837/no-sabo-kid-meaning-new-definition"">barely know Spanish</a>.” </p>



<p>To her surprise, the response was massive. The video quickly went viral, racking up more than 14 million views and 12,000 comments. While some messages were negative, most were supportive, wishing her luck or sharing that their own loved ones had been deported, too.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“I was a little skeptical at first about talking about my deportation on my page. But after I saw that it was well received, my doubts went away.”</p><cite>Sandra Campos</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“I was a little skeptical at first about talking about my deportation on my page,” 28-year-old Campos told Refinery29 Somos during a video call from Guanajuato, a colorful city nestled in the mountains of central Mexico. “But after I saw that it was well received, my doubts went away.”</p>



<p>Campos is part of a growing wave of deportees using TikTok to reclaim their stories and shed light on a side of immigration rarely seen: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/12/11180964/undocumented-daca-immigrants-leaving-us"">what happens after<em> </em>deportation</a>. Through hashtags such as #LifeAfterDeportation, creators share clips about finding work, struggling with Spanish, enrolling their kids in school, and other challenges of rebuilding a life in an unfamiliar place.</p>



<p>“ When I got deported, it wasn’t really big,” said Campos. “Now, everybody’s talking about it.” </p>



<p>For Campos, who was deported in 2020 under the first Trump administration, opening up about such a traumatic event wasn’t easy. “I feel like I was a bit embarrassed about what happened,” she explained. That year, police stopped her for a traffic violation and handed her over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). </p>



<p>Despite qualifying for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/09/10003291/daca-trump-supreme-court-immigrant-experience"">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a> (DACA), the program that allows for deportation protection and work permits for immigrants who were brought over as children, Campos said that her lawyer had advised her not to renew her permit, which she now regrets. Although Campos fought her case, she was deported to Mexico after having lived in Missouri since the age of two.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“I didn’t realize that so many people are going through the same things I went through about not being able to speak Spanish, coming to a whole new place and not knowing what to do.”</p><cite>Sandra Campos</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“Thinking about it now is just crazy, but I hated my life so much [after deportation],” Campos said. “I missed everything about the U.S. I didn’t wanna be here for another minute.”</p>



<p>After spending almost a year with distant relatives in Mexico City, she moved to Guanajuato, found a job as a server, and pursued social media more seriously. Earlier this year, she discovered that what people most resonated with on TikTok was her deportation story. Since her first post in May, she has gained 23,000 followers and received an outpouring of support.</p>



<p>“They say things like, ‘I’m really glad you put your story out there.’ And I’m like, ‘Dang!’ I didn’t realize that so many people are going through the same things I went through about not being able to speak Spanish, coming to a whole new place and not knowing what to do,” she said.</p>



<p>Anna Garcia, a 35-year-old mother of five, knows that feeling well. In 2018, she was arrested at a custody hearing in Utah and deported to Mexico, with $40 in her pocket. Forced to restart her life far from her children felt “like a death sentence,” she told Somos. “I felt like my life was over.” </p>



<p>But over the next year, she pieced her life together in Puerto Vallarta, a city on Mexico’s Pacific Coast, with the goal of regaining custody of her kids. She began <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@annigrcxxx"">documenting her journey</a> on TikTok, gaining half a million followers and becoming a prominent voice for deportees.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“It helps people realize that what they’re feeling — fear, anger, grief — is shared by others, which normalizes those emotions.”</p><cite>Denise Serrato</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><a href=""http://tiktok.com/@annigrcxxx/video/7200468260947578154?_t=ZS-90Qzv7ESaRR&amp;_r=1"">One of her most viral videos</a> captures her reunion with her kids, with a teary-eyed Garcia embracing her children in the Puerto Vallarta International Airport. It’s a moment that might have otherwise gone unnoticed offline, but on TikTok, it allowed for thousands of followers to hold space for her.</p>



<p>One user responded: “So happy for you…I wish you and your babies the best!”</p>



<p>Another said: “My kid’s dad got deported when they were 2 and 6 mo. They are now 6 &amp; 8. I pray they get to reunite with their father one day.”<br /></p>



<p>Denise Serrato, a mental health clinician who often works with immigrant clients, says it’s unsurprising that people who have been affected by deportation are connecting with these stories. “When someone sees deportation stories online, it can trigger a sense of ‘I’m not alone.’ Social media gives visibility to experiences that are often silenced or stigmatized,” she said.</p>



<p>“It helps people realize that what they’re feeling — fear, anger, grief — is shared by others, which normalizes those emotions,” she added.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“I want my content to embody that there is life — and a lot of it — after deportation.”</p><cite>Anna Garcia</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>While Garcia has used the #LifeAfterDeportation hashtag for years, she said that interest has picked up in recent months as more deportations make headlines and anti-immigrant rhetoric intensifies. “ I’ve seen a huge influx of the same type of content,” she said.</p>



<p>For Garcia, who experienced backlash when she first shared her story, seeing more deportation stories online feels like a breakthrough. “It was kind of shameful back then. I have seen a lot of people more comfortable with talking about it now and being empathetic hearing these stories.” </p>



<p>Garcia said that some followers are also reaching out seeking legal advice for loved ones facing deportation. While she tries to offer individual support, she now shares videos offering useful resources for deportees, such as how to access immigration records from the U.S. government or how to seek assistance from Mexican authorities following deportation.</p>



<p>Wanting to help immigrants has motivated Garcia to pursue her dream of becoming an attorney. In August, she <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@annigrcxxx/video/7538154075041352990?_r=1&amp;_t=ZS-90Q7KhU9lm1"">posted a video</a> celebrating the completion of her first year as a law student. The text read: “Watch me turn pain into purpose and grow into a law student in my home country.”</p>



<p>Her message, she said, is simple: life doesn’t end with deportation.</p>



<p>“I want my content to embody that there is life — and a lot of it — after deportation.”</p>

<p>Cosmic crew, welcome to a week that feels like the rom-com scene after the messy breakup montage. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-virgo-horoscope-september-2025-meaning-effects"">Venus, the planet of love</a>, beauty, and “let’s just vibe in harmony,” is officially back home in Libra on October 13th, and the energy is immaculate. After weeks of Virgo nitpicking (“does this person spark joy <em>and </em>meet my 17-point checklist?”), Venus in Libra is like, “girl, relax. Flirt, paint, wear the glitter eyeliner, text them back.” This is us <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">hard-launching</a> joy again in Q4. We’re still intentional, but now the assignment is to let life be a little lighter, a little sexier, a little <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/witchy-gifts-halloween-magic"">more about connection</a>. <br /><br />And Venus doesn’t come alone. Five hours after she steps into Libra, Pluto, the planet of transformation, obsession, and revolution, wakes up from its five-month retrograde nap in Aquarius. And not just any nap: Pluto basically took an ancestral vision quest and came back like, “okay, I’ve got the blueprint for liberation.” The kicker? Venus immediately trines Pluto. Babe, that’s cosmic exhibitionism. This <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/10/10715197/air-signs-meaning-gemini-libra-aquarius"">Air trine</a> is basically the equivalent of them cosmically making out in public, combining forces to remind us how to love harder, freer, and more honestly — both in our own reflections and in the ways we see each other. It’s giving: make love, start revolutions, repeat. </p>



<p>Of course, Mama Luna’s got her own flavor shifts to keep us on our toes. We kick off with the Cancer Moon, which squares Venus in Libra. Translation: tenderness meets tension. You may feel misunderstood in love, or you might over-extend yourself financially/emotionally trying to “keep the peace.” Don’t fall for every sob story, and don’t let someone guilt-trip you out of your boundaries. Midweek, the Moon strides into Leo (Oct 14–16), where it opposes Pluto in Aquarius. Expect collective drama — headlines about power struggles, group accountability, and maybe some performative flexing. On a personal level, check if your pride is clashing with someone else’s truth. </p>



<p>By the weekend, the Moon slides into Virgo (Oct 16–18), syncing beautifully with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars in Scorpio</a>. That’s our cosmic reset: after all the emotional highs, fiery declarations, and power showdowns, we’re reminded to get back to basics. Clean the space, re-organize the notes app, and actually implement the downloads from last week’s Aries Full Moon. Virgo Moon energy is like a Sunday ritual stretched across the weekend — grounding, practical, but still deeply healing. By the end of this week, we’re collectively learning that love, revolution, and liberation don’t have to be abstract. They can show up in small, consistent choices that build a freer, softer life. <br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831490.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, the week kicks off with Venus sliding into Libra on the 13th, activating your partnership sector, and it feels like a cosmic reset button for your relationships. If Venus in Virgo had you second-guessing every little thing about compatibility, Venus in Libra is like, “hey, love can be graceful too.” This transit reminds you that you don’t have to white-knuckle your way through intimacy. It’s about balance, sweetness, laughter, and finding joy in the <em>togetherness </em>of it all. For you, this could mean softer conversations, magnetic new connections, or simply remembering that healthy love feels easy, not heavy. <br /><br />Then comes Pluto, freshly direct in Aquarius, activating your friendship and community sector. Pluto’s been <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pluto-retrograde-in-aquarius-may-2025-meaning-effects"">retrograde for five months</a>, digging through the basement of your social world, and now it emerges with clarity. This is about owning your power in groups, knowing which collectives actually feed your growth, and realizing where you’ve been silencing yourself to “fit in.” Pluto direct is also about revolution in the digital/tech space for you — maybe you’re stepping into a new online platform, finding your voice on social media, or joining a movement that feels too aligned to ignore. Whatever the form, it’s liberation time. </p>



<p>Here’s the kicker: Venus and Pluto, both in Air signs, are trining each other this week. That’s harmony between your partnerships and your friendships, your one-on-one bonds and your wider circles. Gorgeous energy, but remember: even too much harmony can get dizzying. The shadow here could be projecting ideals onto people or chasing the rush of connection without grounding it in reality. Because Venus in Libra still opposes your Aries placements, this week may bring both attraction and tension: what feels sweet could also stretch you outside your comfort zone. The key is balance. Let yourself be inspired by the vision of love and community this trine opens… but don’t forget to keep your feet on the ground and your boundaries intact. </p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, Venus entering Libra on the 13th is basically your ruling planet coming home and tossing you the keys to the wellness suite. This lights up your sector of health, routines, and daily balance. Where Venus in Virgo had you micro-analyzing who or what was draining your joy, Venus in Libra is here to restore harmony, but in practical, embodied ways. This is about making your body feel like a temple again: cooking meals that are both nourishing <em>and </em>aesthetic, finding beauty in your workspace, or bringing more play into your exercise routines. Love doesn’t have to stay in the bedroom this week — it can live in your rituals, your self-care, and how you treat your day-to-day as sacred. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Pluto stations direct in Aquarius, turning the lights back on in your career and long-term vision sector. For the past five months, you may have been privately rethinking what success really means to you, and now the Universe says it’s time to own it out loud. Pluto direct here can feel like an unveiling: a role you’re meant to step into, a professional project that suddenly has momentum, or an inner voice that refuses to let you play small in public anymore. It’s not about overnight fame — it’s about stepping into authority and knowing your voice can shift systems, even subtly. </p>



<p>Now here’s where it gets juicy: Venus in Libra trines Pluto in Aquarius, weaving together your health sector with your career sector. This is cosmic support for aligning what you do daily with the bigger mission you’re building — basically the “habits meet legacy” moment. The high road: designing routines that fuel your professional glow. The shadow? Romanticizing your future vision so much that you forget to show up in the present, or over-committing to roles that drain your body. Remember: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-taurus-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Venus is your ruler</a>, so its harmony with Pluto is powerful for you, but grounding is key. This is the week to let your self-care and your calling be on the same team, not fighting for your attention. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, Venus enters Libra on the 13th and beams straight into your sector of creativity, romance, and joy. This is cosmic permission to flirt with life again. After Venus in Virgo had you stress-testing every detail, Libra says: lighten up. Lean into play, beauty, and love that feels like art. Whether it’s someone you’re crushing on, a passion project you’ve been circling, or just the act of letting yourself <em>enjoy, </em>Venus here reminds you that pleasure is a form of medicine. The more you indulge your inner artist or lover, the more the world mirrors that joy back to you. <br /><br />Then Pluto stations direct in Aquarius, illuminating your expansion sector. For the past five months, you’ve been reflecting on what freedom really means: what you want to study, where you want to travel, how you want to push past the limits of your current story. Pluto waking up here is like a lightbulb moment — you suddenly see where you’ve been conditioned to think too small, and you’re ready to stretch. This isn’t about reckless leaps; it’s about claiming your right to live bigger, wiser, and braver. </p>



<p>When Venus and Pluto trine, your creativity and joy align seamlessly with your expansion and growth. This is the Air-sign magic you thrive on: ideas, art, and experiences flowing like oxygen. The high vibe? Love that teaches you something new, creative projects that expand your worldview, travel or studies that spark romance. The shadow? Chasing ideals so fast you forget to ground them, or projecting fantasies onto people who can’t deliver. Venus in Libra does oppose your Gemini placements by modality (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cardinal-mutable-fixed-signs"">cardinal vs. mutable</a>), so pacing matters. Let yourself be enchanted by the possibilities, but also anchor them — sketch the dream, but also build the frame to hold it. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, are you ready for some necessary shake-ups at home? Venus enters Libra on the 13th, highlighting your sector of family, roots, and emotional foundation. This isn’t about surface-level décor changes (though you may feel called to rearrange your space); it’s about bringing harmony where there’s been tension. Venus here wants you to ask: does my living environment feel like love? Does it reflect balance, beauty, and peace — or just clutter and compromise? Shadows could show up if you’ve been people-pleasing with relatives or ignoring your own needs in order to “keep the peace.” Venus in Libra pushes you to re-center yourself as much as you care for others. <br /><br />Pluto, meanwhile, is stationing direct in Aquarius in your intimacy and shared resources sector. For the past five months, you’ve likely been reflecting on power dynamics — financially, emotionally, or sexually — and Pluto direct brings all of that into sharper focus. This isn’t light energy; it’s about transformation through vulnerability. Maybe you’re renegotiating financial commitments, maybe you’re deepening a bond, or maybe you’re finally letting go of an entanglement that’s been too heavy. Pluto asks: where have you been afraid to surrender, and what would true liberation feel like? </p>



<p>Now, Venus and Pluto are trining each other — <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/10/10715197/air-signs-meaning-gemini-libra-aquarius"">Air-sign</a> magic — connecting your domestic world with your deeper bonds. This is gorgeous energy for building a home life that actually supports the intimacy you crave. It could feel like a breath of fresh air in relationships, or like the courage to merge resources in a way that uplifts both of you. But here’s the caution: trines can get intoxicating. Don’t get swept away in fantasies of the “perfect” partner or the “ideal” home setup without checking in on reality. The sweet spot for you this week is grounding… finding the balance between dreamy upgrades and tangible foundations. If you can do that, you’re stepping into a new level of security that feeds both your heart and your future. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, you ready for your words to turn heads? Venus enters Libra on the 13th, activating your communication sector and making your voice magnetic. This is the week where conversations turn flirty, your writing or content pops off, and even casual chats feel charged with charm. Venus here wants you to find beauty in the exchange — to say what you mean, but also to say it with grace. On the shadow side, you could be tempted to smooth things over with pretty words instead of being real. Remember: harmony is cute, but honesty is what sustains connections. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Pluto stations direct in Aquarius, lighting up your partnership sector. After five months of retrograde review, the dynamics in your closest bonds are about to shift. This could look like a deeper level of intimacy in a romantic relationship, a business alliance leveling up, or a friendship where truth finally surfaces. Pluto in Aquarius isn’t casual — it’s about collective liberation through personal honesty. You’ll feel the push to show up fully as yourself in relationships, even if that means releasing dynamics that no longer honor your growth. </p>



<p>Here’s the magic: Venus in Libra and Pluto in Aquarius are trining each other, harmonizing your communication with your partnerships. Translation: your words have the power to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/04/11877498/dreamville-festival-2025-north-carolina-travel-diary"">transform your connections</a> right now. The high road? Conversations that bring clarity, confessions that strengthen bonds, agreements that feel like fresh air. The shadow? Getting swept up in love-bombing, saying yes too quickly, or over romanticizing what someone <em>could </em>be. Balance your fire with discernment. When you stay grounded in your truth, this trine helps you build relationships that are both magnetic and sustainable. </p>

<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, are you ready to rethink your money moves? Venus enters Libra on the 13th, lighting up your sector of income, values, and self-worth. After weeks of Virgo-Venus energy that had you hyper-analyzing every detail, this shift feels like a sigh of relief. Venus in Libra asks: how can you bring more balance to your finances and more beauty to your relationship with abundance? Maybe that looks like investing in something that uplifts you, or finally realizing that wealth isn’t just about numbers — it’s about alignment with what you truly value. Shadow side? Spending just to “keep up appearances” or ignoring the deeper work of budgeting because it feels less glamorous. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Pluto stations direct in Aquarius, shaking awake your health, work, and routine sector. For the past five months, you’ve been reconsidering how you pour your energy into daily tasks — and who benefits from it. Pluto direct here says: no more leaking your power through endless to-dos or toxic workplace dynamics. This is transformation at the ground level of your life — how you move through your mornings, how you care for your body, how you decide what <em>really </em>deserves your focus. The changes might feel subtle at first, but they’re foundational. </p>



<p>With Venus and Pluto forming a trine, your money and values sector aligns with your work and wellness sector. Translation: it’s time to let your values <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/human-design-astrology-skincare-routine"">shape your routines</a> and your routines support your values. Gorgeous synergy, but it comes with a caution: don’t over-idealize quick fixes or chase shiny purchases as a substitute for deeper discipline. The beauty here is in building harmony that lasts. If you commit to balance — financially, physically, spiritually — this trine helps you create systems that feel like love in action. </p>

<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, are you ready for your cosmic glow-up? Venus, your ruling planet, enters your sign on the 13th and suddenly the spotlight is squarely on you. This is the start of a season where your aura feels magnetic, your style feels on point, and people can’t help but orbit closer. Venus here is like, “remember that you are the art.” It’s a call to celebrate yourself — not in a shallow way, but by honoring your beauty, your charm, and your ability to create harmony just by being present. The shadow side? Over focusing on external validation or smoothing over conflicts so much that you erase your own needs. <br /><br />Pluto, meanwhile, stations direct in Aquarius, activating your sector of creativity, romance, and joy. For the past five months, you’ve been internally processing what sparks passion and what feels stale. Now, Pluto’s direct turn invites you to step fully into your desires: to reclaim the parts of yourself that crave fun, artistry, and intimacy without shame. This isn’t about casual thrills — it’s about digging into what actually transforms you. You may feel pulled toward lovers or projects that change the way you see yourself forever. </p>



<p>And here’s where it all clicks: Venus in Libra and Pluto in Aquarius are trining, weaving your sense of self with your creative and romantic fire. This is cosmic electricity, making you irresistible to opportunities that reflect who you truly are. The high road? Using this magnetism to create, connect, and inspire. The shadow? Getting swept away in the rush of attraction, or romanticizing people/projects that look shiny but lack depth. With all this air energy, stay grounded. When you center your authentic self, this week can feel like the start of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-enjoy-winter-ideas"">new personal era</a> — bold, beautiful, and deeply true to you. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, are you ready to face what’s been lurking in the background? Venus enters Libra on the 13th, activating your sector of rest, healing, and the subconscious. This is a tender placement for Venus — it asks you to soften, retreat, and reconnect with the unseen parts of yourself. Think: more solitude, more journaling, more dreaming. Instead of chasing external validation, Venus here helps you rediscover harmony inside. The shadow? Escaping into fantasies or romanticizing unavailable people just because it feels safe at a distance. Venus in Libra reminds you: intimacy with yourself is the foundation for intimacy with anyone else. <br /><br />At the same time, Pluto, your second planetary ruler, stations direct in Aquarius, waking up your sector of home, family, and roots. For the past five months, you’ve been excavating the stories you inherited from your past — the patterns around safety, power, and belonging. Pluto’s direct turn can feel like a breakthrough: suddenly you see clearly which ancestral cycles you’re meant to break, or how to reclaim control in your domestic life. This could manifest as literal home changes or as emotional clarity about where (and with whom) you truly feel at home. </p>



<p>When Venus and Pluto trine, your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/therapy-healing-relationship-family-friends-impact"">inner healing</a> sector links with your home and family sector. This is potent for mending old wounds, repairing family dynamics, or finally creating a sanctuary that actually reflects your soul. But remember: too much air-trine harmony can feel intoxicating, like you’ve already transcended the work. Don’t get carried away by the idea of a “perfect” healing breakthrough — keep showing up for the daily practices that anchor it. If you do, this week can feel like a deep exhale: the merging of inner peace and outer stability in ways you’ve been craving for years.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, are you ready to shake up your circle? Venus enters Libra on the 13th, lighting up your sector of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/age-gap-friendship-benefits-different-generations"">friendships, community</a>, and collective vision. Suddenly, you’re the connector — introducing people, sparking collaborations, and feeling the love in your wider networks. Venus here is about harmony in your social world, reminding you that the right community feels like art: balanced, supportive, and fun. The shadow? Getting caught up in popularity contests or trying to keep the peace when deeper truths need to be addressed. Venus in Libra asks: which relationships are worth the effort, and which are just background noise? <br /><br />Meanwhile, Pluto stations direct in Aquarius, electrifying your communication and learning sector. For the past five months, you’ve been digging deeper into how you speak, teach, and share your ideas — maybe even confronting fears around being misunderstood. Now Pluto’s direct, your words carry weight. This is a season where your voice can catalyze change, whether that’s through content, conversations, or speaking up in rooms that used to intimidate you. Your mind feels sharper, braver, and ready to break through outdated narratives. </p>



<p>Together, Venus in Libra and Pluto in Aquarius form a trine, linking your friendships with your communication. Translation: your voice has the power to rally your community, and your community has the power to amplify your voice. The high road? Building movements, friendships, or projects that feel revolutionary <em>and </em>joyful. The shadow? Getting swept away in the echo chamber — mistaking group hype for true alignment, or chasing ideals without grounding them. This week, stay rooted in your truth. When you combine your natural optimism with Pluto’s intensity and Venus’s charm, your words can spark the kind of connections that change everything. </p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, are you ready to step into the spotlight? Venus enters Libra on the 13th, activating your career and public recognition sector. This is your cue to shine professionally, whether that means your work finally gets the applause it deserves or you simply feel more magnetic in public spaces. Venus transiting Libra smooths over authority dynamics, helps you attract collaborators, and gives you the charisma to pitch, present, or lead with ease. The shadow? Over-polishing your image to the point where you hide your real self. Venus in Libra reminds you: true success is when your outer reputation matches your inner alignment. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Pluto stations direct in Aquarius, waking up your money and values sector. For the past five months, you’ve been rethinking your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/05/10960772/building-generational-wealth-latinx-experts"">relationship with wealth</a> and worth — what you spend on, what you save, and what you expect in return for your efforts. Pluto direct here can feel like a breakthrough: maybe a new financial opportunity, a deeper awareness of your value in professional settings, or the courage to say no when something doesn’t align with your standards. This is empowerment through resources, not just survival. </p>



<p>Now, with Venus and Pluto forming a trine, your career sector aligns beautifully with your money and values. The high vibe? Work that feels rewarding <em>and </em>pays accordingly, opportunities to negotiate your worth with ease, or finding harmony between your ambitions and your bank account. The shadow? Getting carried away by external validation — chasing titles, applause, or financial wins at the expense of your deeper purpose. This week is about grounding your ambition in authenticity. When you lead from that place, the recognition and the resources flow naturally. </p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, are you ready to feel like you’ve woken up from a five-month dream? Pluto stations direct in your sign on the 13th, and it’s like the lights come back on. For months, you’ve been internally dissecting your identity, power, and long-term vision. Now Pluto’s direct turn says: it’s time to embody what you’ve been processing. This could feel liberating — like a fresh layer of skin — but also intense, as you recognize just how much <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/let-them-theory-tiktok-relationships-dating"">you’ve changed</a>. The shadow? Clinging to outdated versions of yourself because it feels safer than stepping into the radical transformation that’s calling you. <br /><br />At the same time, Venus enters Libra and blesses your sector of expansion, travel, education, and big-picture dreams. This is a beautiful transit for saying yes to adventures, whether that means booking a trip, signing up for a class, or diving into a philosophy that lights you up. Venus in Libra says, “make it beautiful, make it joyful,” reminding you that expansion doesn’t have to feel like pressure; it can feel like pleasure. The shadow here would be chasing escapism… running off to find harmony somewhere else instead of tending to what’s right in front of you. </p>



<p>Together, Venus and Pluto form a trine, linking your sense of self with your growth sector. Translation: this is cosmic support for becoming a more expansive, liberated version of you — one who knows their worth and isn’t afraid to explore new horizons. The high road? Aligning with people, projects, or studies that stretch you in ways that feel inspiring. The caution? Getting carried away with ideals and forgetting to ground your progress in the present. This week is about marrying transformation with adventure, liberation with joy. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, are you ready to go deep? Venus enters Libra on the 13th, activating your sector of intimacy, shared resources, and deep trust. This is a week where your closest bonds could feel sweeter, deeper, and more harmonious — whether financially, emotionally, or romantically. Venus here invites you to explore what reciprocity feels like when it’s balanced and beautiful. The shadow? Romanticizing unavailable people or ignoring red flags just to preserve the illusion of peace. Venus in Libra wants you to ask: does this connection truly feel mutual, or am I just playing nice? <br /><br />Meanwhile, Pluto stations direct in Aquarius, lighting up your subconscious and healing sector. For <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pluto-retrograde-in-aquarius-may-2025-meaning-effects"">the past five months</a>, you’ve been moving through shadow work quietly, processing fears, dreams, and old conditioning that shape your present. Pluto direct here is a revelation: suddenly, what’s been hidden becomes undeniable. This can feel intense, but it’s also freeing, because you can’t heal what you don’t see. Pay attention to dreams, intuitive nudges, and subtle patterns this week — they hold the keys to liberation. </p>



<p>With Venus and Pluto forming a trine, your intimacy sector links with your subconscious. Translation: deep healing and transformation are possible through love, trust, and vulnerability. The high vibe? Relationships that feel like medicine, money moves that free you from old limitations, or breakthroughs in therapy or spiritual practice. The shadow? Getting lost in fantasies of merging so fully with others that you forget yourself. Balance is key. This week, intimacy is powerful, but it works best when you bring your full, sovereign self into the connection.</p>

<p>Just like its subject matter, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8R6DMlDtxk""><em>After The Hunt</em></a> is polarizing. The <a href=""https://www.gq.com/story/luca-guadagnino-wants-to-run-a-film-festival"">Luca Guadagnino</a>-directed and <a href=""https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/after-the-hunt-screenwriter-nora-garrett-interview-1235154652/"">Nora Garrett</a>-written psychological thriller is being met with mixed reviews. In one camp, you have those who think the film (starring <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/08/11504839/ayo-edebiri-bottoms-sag-aftra-strike"">Ayo Edebiri</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/andrew-garfield"">Andrew Garfield</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/julia-roberts-hair-stylist-interview"">Julia Roberts</a>), which wades into the treacherous waters of depicting the aftermath of a sexual assault on campus, is <a href=""https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/after-the-hunt-film-review-2025"">“sharp”, “well-calibrated” and “provocative”</a> and in the other, you’ve got those who have written the film off as <a href=""https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/movies/articles/hunt-review-julia-roberts-stars-173419042.html"">“wasted potential” full of “unlikeable characters.”</a> <em>The New Yorker</em> called <em>After The Hunt </em>“<a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/10/13/after-the-hunt-movie-review"">a pleasurably ludicrous house of cards</a>” while the <em>New York Times</em> pegged the film as “<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/movies/after-the-hunt-review.html"">uncomfortable, for the wrong reasons</a>.” The opposing responses are inevitable when you’re plunging headlong into a <a href=""https://metoomvmt.org/get-to-know-us/tarana-burke-founder/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">topic like #MeToo</a>, a movement turned hashtag turned buzzword that stirs passionate defenses or ardent attacks at its mere mention, usually depending on your political leanings. There’s never going to be a general consensus on cancel culture, racism, sexism, and feminism, or overwhelming unity on how to approach the zeitgeist’s most hotly-debated subjects. The inconsistency is the point. That’s not to say that <em>After The Hunt</em> doesn’t take a clear stance on these issues by its end — it does — but it deftly captures the push-and-pull (and cringe) of where these discussions have landed in the past five years, sometimes clumsily but with nuance, complexity, and self-awareness. </p>



<p>And it’s in that audacity to let its waters stay murky, to allow its characters to be unreliable and unlikeable, and to live in the grey, where I think <em>After The Hunt</em> shines. Roberts plays Alma Imhoff, a Yale professor whose star student, Maggie (Edebiri), accuses her colleague and best friend, Hank (Garfield), of sexual assault. From pretentious pseudo-intellectual debates over whisky to hard-to-watch faceoffs between two women from different generations and races who throw jabs about pronouns and intersectionality at each other to the unfairly messy politics of consent, <em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCC7iIMHq2U"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">After The Hunt</a> </em>dares to capture the frustration, hypocrisy and absurdity of the past five to six years (the movie is set from 2019-2025). It doesn’t deliver answers necessarily, but neither does that white dude in your Ethics 101 class — or your timeline — trying to debate you about your humanity. Mostly, these topics shouldn’t be up for debate at all. <em>After The Hunt</em> asks you to confront your own participation in making sexual assault a punchline and complicity in twisting the push for victims into fodder for the culture wars. The movie’s biggest flaw is that the racial dynamic between Maggie and Alma isn’t mined enough, but thanks to stellar performances by Roberts (her best in years) and Edebiri (consistently proving she’s a <em>star</em>), the gaps in the script are filled in with subtext and loaded stares. Throw in a live wire Garfield (he’s riveting and infuriating) and you’ve got a film that grabs hold and doesn’t let go until its final frame. Plus, it’s just a good movie that’s propulsively watchable, albeit unnerving. </p>

<p>The week I saw <em>After The Hunt </em>was the same week news broke that <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/24/arts/television/the-savant-apple-tv-plus.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Apple TV was shelving </a><em><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/24/arts/television/the-savant-apple-tv-plus.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Savant</a></em>, a series in which <a href=""https://time.com/7320232/the-savant-apple-tv-jessica-chastain/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jessica Chastain</a> plays an undercover investigator who infiltrates online hate groups to take down violent extremists, in the aftermath of the murder of <a href=""https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/charlie-kirk-ezra-klein-tanehisi-coates?srsltid=AfmBOoqCp4lcrSX-2nZEsCKOrppLRX-Blw6tyBZrPK9fVFiDIjEhU8Mq"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">right wing podcaster Charlie Kirk</a> reportedly because its subject matter was too sensitive and too close to real life. To me, that’s exactly <em>why</em> that series should have been released. <a href=""https://deadline.com/2025/09/jessica-chastain-does-not-agree-apple-the-savant-postponed-1236554606/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chastain agreed</a>. I’m tired of Hollywood’s fear of tackling relevant topics, I’m tired of films that don’t try to say anything at all. I’m tired of movies that seem built by an algorithm designed to garner the least backlash. At least <em>After The Hunt </em>has a backbone. Throughout the film, Guadagnino delivers a “<a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/10/13/after-the-hunt-movie-review"">borderline trollish act of homage</a>” to famously “cancelled” Woody Allen, and it’s a rare, bold confrontation of the real-life controversies <em>After The Hunt</em> is trying to satirize. It was a big swing, and whether you like it or not, the film is an accurate snapshot of the #MeToo era. </p>

<p><em>After The Hunt </em>documents a moment in time — a disturbing, delicate, and awkward moment in time, one that we are still navigating. And for better or worse, shouldn’t we have art that reflects these times? Sometimes, I think I can tell when a movie is going to outlive its discourse. With time, <em>After The Hunt</em> may hold up as a page to be read in the chapter of this so-called cultural reckoning. Think of it as a sleek and uncomfortable time capsule of the past half decade of #MeToo discourse, or as a character study of flawed intellectuals desperately attempting to perform their values while clinging to the facade of their respective identities. Or, as Edebiri told me, <em>After The Hunt </em>is a “<a href=""https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-rorschach-inkblot-test-2795806"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Rorschach test</a>” that interrogates your discomfort. </p>



<p>Refinery29 spoke to Edebiri and her co-star Garfield over video chat during the film’s press junket in New York City and the duo discussed everything from their hesitation to play these parts, the psyches of their divisive characters, and the more lighthearted generational debates that dominate our timelines. <em>Mild spoilers ahead.</em></p>



<p><strong>Refinery29: One of the biggest things I was thinking when I was watching<em> After The Hunt </em></strong><strong>was,<em> wow, they really went there. </em></strong><strong>The movie thrives in the discomfort of some of these big cultural conversations. Did either of you have any apprehension or hesitation when it came to tackling such lightning rod issues?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ayo Edebiri: </strong>Yes, definitely, definitely. But I think part of that was the reason that drew me to this [film] and interrogating within myself: <em>what are my apprehensions? Why am I self censoring my thoughts about these conversations? </em>It’s proof in a lot of these spaces that the reason why we’re not done is because we don’t want to touch certain areas — on all sides. So being able to then go here’s this amazing, intentional, thoughtful, caring group of people and we all want to dig into this thing with each other. It was an honor to get to dive in.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937718.png?width=1024&amp;height=640&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=8%3A5"" /></figure>



<p><strong>Andrew, do you feel the same way?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Andrew Garfield: </strong>I do, and I think we’re in a moment in time right now where artists can feel fearful around what they’re allowed to express or explore. And we’re all looking to survive out here in this life. We want to make sure that our work gets sponsored and we rely on sponsorship. We rely on studios, on institutions, on people with paychecks to get projects made, to get our work into people’s hearts, and that can be costly to our own integrity sometimes. And with this [film], it was like, <em>Oh, we get to explore a very, very tender arena of subjects, and we get to really do it. </em>And I’ve said this before, but when Luca told me that Ayo was gonna be playing this part, that reassured me a great deal, because not only is she a great actress, but she’s someone who really considers these things in a very, very caring, sensitive position of humility and care. Obviously, this is a series of subjects that require that kind of care. </p>



<p><strong>I think that care came through. And I think it’s also just important for films to reflect a snapshot of what the cultural conversation is, especially in the last five years. But much as it is about these big topics, it’s really just a character study that digs into complicated people and the ways in which they are selfish, manipulative, and not always the most moral people. There’s no clear hero or villain throughout most of the movie. Can you both talk about the importance of those moral grey areas and characters who aren’t necessarily likable?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE: </strong>It’s been interesting and honestly really cool listening to people who have watched the film, and sometimes more than once, saying how they felt the day they saw it, versus a week later, when you’ve had more time to marinate on it. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://i1.wp.com/www.refinery29.com/images/11937773.jpeg?ssl=1"" /></figure>



<p>All of these characters have their own context, their own histories, their own baggage, that they’re walking around with — however conscious or unconscious. And I think in the same vein, when you’re a moviegoer, that’s happening too. You’re thinking like,<em> Oh, here’s what I’m gonna expect out of a Luca Guadagnino film, or out of a Julia Roberts performance.</em> These are the characters. And this one is the Black girl. So this is what she’s going to do in the story engine. We’re walking around with all these things. And you can watch the movie one way and get what you want out of it, or you can realize something is being subverted, both in the film and in yourself. I think it’s like this really cool, tricky, layered Rorschach Test that Luca put together, and it’s very intentional. </p>

<p>The more that I watch the movie, or the more I sit with it, I’m like<em>, Oh my God, there’s this thing that I didn’t notice</em>, even though I was fully there. I think that act of conversation is what’s really important to me. If we can, in this type of work and play, get to lead people to these conversations, that’s pretty cool.</p>

<p><strong>Ayo, I keep thinking about the first time we see Maggie, and she’s looking at this African artifact in Alma’s house. To me it told me a lot about this character and her discomfort in this predominantly white space. I know you went to NYU, a predominantly white institution. What were the ways in which you related to Maggie and do you have any advice for Black women navigating those spaces? </strong></p>



<p><strong>AE: </strong>What’s interesting to me about Maggie is that I feel we have very different ethoses and in places I think there’s discomfort. We’ve been talking a lot about the subconscious versus the conscious. I don’t know if Maggie would describe herself as uncomfortable in that moment.</p>



<p><strong>Interesting! </strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> I don’t know if she would, to be honest, and that’s its own very loaded thing. And I don’t know how much she’s aware of that, but it is operating outside of her. There’s also a scene where she hugs Julia [playing Alma] and she looks up at a statue. That statue is one of Yale’s founders. That man was a slave owner. The movie ends on the shot of money. Who is the President on the money? These sorts of things are just operating all the time underneath us, while we’re also engaged in these person-to-person interactions day-to-day where we’re maybe forgetting them or ignoring them. That’s what I have to say about the Maggie of it all. </p>



<p>As for advice, yes, I went to a PWI for college. That’s not an uncommon experience. I think finding your people, finding your safe space, whatever that looks like, and making space for connection and sanity — where you need it —  is important. I don’t know if that’s advice, but that’s just what I would say.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://i1.wp.com/www.refinery29.com/images/11937728.jpg?ssl=1"" /></figure>



<p><strong>That’s good advice. Andrew, Hank is so sure he is a good guy but proves by things he says and his actions that he is not. How did you approach that nice guy facade he puts up?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AG:</strong> Yeah, I think he believes he is. He really does believe he’s a good person. I think he feels victimized, and that’s interesting. I just play it as it lays, you play it as it is. And he’s someone that feels like he’s worked very, very hard to get to where he’s got to, that he’s come from a less privileged background, even as a white male, and that he’s had to put in extra hours, extra time, extra energy, and he thinks he’s on the receiving end of an unfair kind of witch hunt. And it’s a really fascinating place to experience, particularly as Hank in the sense of<em> oh yeah, but there’s no way that anyone else is going to see it like this. </em></p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>When Luca told me that Ayo was gonna be playing this part, that reassured me a great deal.. not only is she a great actress, but she’s someone who really considers these things in a caring, sensitive position of humility and care.</p><cite>andrew garfield</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The isolation of it is really interesting. The loneliness is really interesting. And the comprehension of that loneliness, the awareness of, <em>well, I’m fucked and there’s nowhere to go. </em>I think what’s interesting mostly is the very brief moment that he gets to have of self reckoning at the end of his journey in the film where he maybe gets a glimpse of a part of himself that he had been trying to avoid throughout the story, a part of himself that is able to behave in ways that he would rather not look at. And I think that’s in every scene, whether he knows it or not, that’s in every single time we see him, that ability, that capacity, that entitlement.</p>



<p><strong>Entitlement is a good word for Hank. The idea of generational divides is a big theme in the movie so we’re going to end on some rapid fire questions about millennials versus Gen Z. Ayo, you are technically Gen Z, but I heard you spiritually identify as a millennial, right? </strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> I’m not technically Gen Z. I’m technically a millennial! I’m literally turning 30. <br /><strong>AG:</strong> And I’m a geriatric millennial. <br /><strong>AE:</strong> Everyone kept calling me Gen Z. And Luca I kept being like, “Stop saying you’re about to be 30. People need to think you’re Gen Z.” And they do that to me and Rachel [Sennott]. They’re like ‘these girls, who you think are young, are actually turning so old? Can you believe [these girls] are about to die at the end of this year, because they’re so old?’<em> [laughs] </em></p>

<p><strong>OK, settle these online debates once and for all. Gen Z prefers TikTok and millennials prefer Instagram. Who are you with: Gen Z or Millennials?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE: </strong>Neither. Burn it all. <br /><strong>AG: </strong>Neither, kill it! Burn it! </p>



<p><strong>Gen Z prefer staying home and millennials prefer going to the club. Who are you with: Gen Z or Millennials?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE: </strong>In between. <br /><strong>AG:</strong> Let it be. Let everyone be what they want to be, man. I like being at home. </p>



<p><strong>Millennials value stability while Gen Z puts more of an emphasis on finding their dream job. Who are you with: Gen Z or Millennials?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>We need to have a foot in both worlds. <br /><strong>AE:</strong> General strike! <br /><strong>AG:</strong> We gotta survive.<br /><strong>AE: </strong>General strike! <br /><strong>AG: </strong>But we also have our souls. <br /><strong>AE: </strong>General strike! </p>

<p>Get whisked away from mundane days and adult responsibilities, even if just for a moment, with the upcoming <a href=""https://www.gap.com/browse/gapx/gap-sandy-liang?cid=3050683&amp;mlink=3044135,1,HP_GAPX_BANNER_Sandy_C_ExploreGapX"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Gap x Sandy Liang collaboration</a>. </p>



<p>Announced via an <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPjJRG-DUkg/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA=="">animated short film</a> created by Annie Choi, Liang’s childhood in New York is reimagined through a nostalgic lens. We see her sketching before her own “dream closet” comes to life with new clothes that empower her before she captures a shooting star. The aesthetic and playfulness perfectly captures Liang’s signature whimsical designs. </p>



<p>“‘Sandy’s Dream Closet’ illustrates how wearing Gap made me feel growing up as I imagined being an adult one day and who I could be,” Liang said in a press release. “I wanted to take the pieces that meant something to me as a kid and reimagine them through my lens today — celebrating girlhood in all its forms, while honoring the iconic styles that make Gap so timeless.”</p>



<p>And with Gap’s portfolio of collaborations, like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-beis-luggage-collaboration-2025"">with Béis</a> (and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-studio-summer-new-arrivals"">GapStudio</a>’s recent <a href=""https://www.gap.com/browse/new/gapstudio?cid=3045197&amp;mlink=5058,1,HP_MERCH_BANNER_GAPSTUDIO_LAUNCH_W_ShopCollection"">partnership with Gwyneth Paltrow</a> and Apple Martin), we know that this on-point designer collab will be another sought-after and successful one.</p>







<p>Known for her feminine aesthetic via pastels, ruffles, and bows, Liang is bringing her style to Gap via a trench coat with an oversized bow, a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ballet-sneaker-shoe-trend"">Mary Jane ballet flat</a>-printed sweater, and a <a href=""https://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=853294002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050683&amp;cid=3050683#pdp-page-content"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">denim baseball cap with “star”</a> written in Gap’s logo font. You’ll also find Gap essentials, like hoodies and low-rise jeans with the Liang treatment (AKA bow stitching, vegan fur, and the designer’s first name). And don’t forget about the children (not just your inner child) — there will be <a href=""https://www.gap.com/browse/gapx/gap-sandy-liang?cid=3050683&amp;mlink=3044135,1,HP_GAPX_BANNER_Sandy_C_ExploreGapX#department=165"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">online-exclusive baby and toddler styles</a>, like a onesie, sweatsuit, and spotted fur jacket (which matches the womenswear style lower down). </p>



<p>“Sandy Liang has cultivated both an engaged community and an iconic design perspective, which has allowed her to reimagine our heritage pieces into something entirely new, yet familiar,” said President and CEO of Gap, Mark Breitbard, in the release.</p>







<p>The apparel collection will range between a <a href=""https://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864523002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050683&amp;cid=3050683#pdp-page-content"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">$15 clear tote bag</a> to a <a href=""https://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=853540002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050683&amp;cid=3050683#pdp-page-content"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">$268 reversible leather-sherpa jacket</a>, available in select stores and online on <strong>October 10 and 9 a.m. EST</strong>.

<p>I’ve never been much of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/04/11876654/best-festivals-to-attend-2025"">festival girlie</a>. It’s not because I don’t love live music (I do); Between big crowds (I’m barely 5’2 and main stage GA is not the most short-girl-friendly situation), prolonged time in the sun, and expensive food and drinks (in this economy?!), I always resolved to a life of catching the action on social media from the safety of my couch. However, when <a href=""https://www.t-mobile.com/"">T-Mobile</a> invited me to experience Austin City Limits the magenta way, I jumped at the chance. It felt like kismet: I’ve been a T-Mobile girlie for years, and as a newly-minted Texan (I moved to Dallas during the summer), what could be more fun that getting to channel my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tecovas-cowboy-boots-new-arrivals"">inner cowgirl</a> at the state’s biggest music festival?</p>



<p>Ahead, join me as I document three days of discovering my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/festival-fashion-trends-2025"">festival style</a>, and how to try the look out for yourself.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Day One: Floral Frontier</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937352.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The first thing I kept in mind when packing for ACL was that it was going to be hot. As in, 90-degrees-in-direct-sunlight hot. In general, I love to “shop” my closet — I’m a proud outfit repeater — and found an old Reformation dress I bought at a sample sale ages ago but never worn. (<a href=""https://www.thereformation.com/products/everett-mini-linen-dress/1318183TRU.html"">Here</a>‘s a similar one in linen.) Paired with my favorite <a href=""https://www.tecovas.com/products/the-annie?color=fawn-suede"">Tecovas cowboy boots</a> (also from my closet, a gift from when I moved to Dallas), I decided to lean into the yee-haw vibes with a chocolate bandana I got at <a href=""https://www.freepeople.com/shop/bridgette-bandana-hair-scarf/?color=025"">Free People</a>. And with a backdrop of side-stage access (an extra-special perk that fans could also experience via gumball machine at <a href=""https://www.t-mobile.com/benefits"">T-Mobile’s Club Magenta</a>). It was truly a next-level festival experience.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Day Two: Lace &amp; Leather</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937516.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>For day two, I decided to go for an off-duty cowgirl look featuring a romantic <a href=""https://www.freepeople.com/shop/how-sweet-is-it-cami/?color=011"">lace tank</a> and faux suede <a href=""https://www.freepeople.com/shop/nova-fringe-shorts/?color=020"">fringe micro shorts</a>, both from Free People. (This is not an #ad, I just genuinely love the brand!) I recently found the cutest cowboy hat ever at Anthropologie — it works as a neutral but has teeny-tiny sequins sewn throughout for a hint of sparkle. It was a total compliment magnet, and also helped keep me cool during a day of truly incredible sets from the T-Mobile stage. (Also keeping me cool: The AC, fans, and drink stations at Club Magenta — in the club, we’re all fam!) </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Day Three: Midnight Rodeo</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937351.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>My last festival outfit was a bit of a departure from my usual jeans-and-a-tee everyday style, but when at ACL right? This look was vaguely inspired by <a href=""https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/all-about-lainey-wilsons-signature-outfits-at-the-2023-cma-awards/"">Lainey Wilson’s 2023 CMA outfit</a>, a black Carolina Herrera strapless jumpsuit with dramatic bell-bottom flares. I found (or rather, they found me via Instagram ad) these <a href=""https://amzn.to/4h1riCp"">lace wide-leg pants</a> on Amazon, which ended up being a perfect choice since they were airy and breathable. I styled it with a DKNY corset top in black satin — another old closet find, but Abercrombie &amp; Fitch has a <a href=""https://www.abercrombie.com/shop/us/p/lace-and-satin-balconette-corset-52554319"">similar style</a> I love. I wore the same <a href=""https://www.anthropologie.com/shop/sparkle-cowboy-rancher-hat?color=024&amp;quantity=1&amp;size=0000&amp;type=STANDARD"">Anthropologie cowboy hat</a> from the previous day, plus a black silk bandana tied around my wrist to tie (heh) everything together. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>All in all, I left my first Austin City Limits feeling more confident in incorporating Western and Americana elements in my outfits, and can’t wait to continue experimenting with my personal style in my new city. And as much as I enjoy shopping for an upcoming trip/date/event, I also loved repurposing what I already had, and figuring out new ways to style existing pieces in my closet. Same time next year?</p>

Lola Tung has been serving immaculate press looks for <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-to-watch-after-summer-i-turned-pretty"">The Summer I Turned Pretty</a> Season 3</em>, and with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-movie"">the movie</a> on the way, we can expect more Y2K-inspired dreamy updos in the future. The star landed her breakout role in <em>TSITP </em>when she was just 18. She has since gone on to make her Broadway debut in Hadestown and has two other films, <em><a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30691214/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Forbidden Fruits</a></em> and <em>The Young People</em>, yet to be released.<br /><br />There's plenty of beauty inspiration to take from Tung's gorgeous looks, so if you need something to take to the hairdresser or an idea of what hair accessories to try next, look no further. From a sleek blowout at the Paris finale celebration to her 60s-inspired pony at Paris Fashion Week, here's a look at all of <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7535217274479824159?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lola Tung's</a> best hairstyles over the years. <figure><img height=""2999"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11935191.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2999&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=2000:2999"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><h2>Lola Tung's sleek blowout at <em>TSITP</em>'s Paris celebration<br /></h2><br />For <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty's</em> Season 3 finale celebration in Paris, the actor opted for a middle part with a sleek blowout.

While she was game to chop her hair off for the show, due to scenes being shot out of order, it was faked slightly with a wig. So, if you want to sport a bob but don't want to commit, a wig could be an option for you.

Wearing a 2003 Versace purple mini slip dress and white slip-on heels, her look reminded us of Jennifer Garner in <em>Suddenly 30</em>.

<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-7-virtues-vanilla-woods-perfume-fragrance-review"">vanilla perfume trend</a> isn’t going anywhere soon — if anything, perfume’s favorite gourmand has only gotten more ubiquitous these days. And when it comes to vanilla scents, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/"">Noyz</a> is down bad. The Los Angeles-based perfume label has multiple interpretations of the popular note, including editor-favorite <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/noyz-detour-vanilla-perfume-review"">Detour</a>, which debuted earlier this year.</p>



<p>But we’re here to talk about the brand’s latest launch, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/only-human"">Only Human</a>. The vanilla-forward scent combines the warm, cozy appeal of gourmands with the intoxicating vibe of another major fragrance trend: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/best-skin-scents"">Skin scents</a>.</p>



<p>Notes of vanilla bean, ambroxan, and cedarwood blend with invigorating pink pepper, bergamot, and lily to create a scent that’s complex, addictive, and perfect for fall. Combining vanilla with woody notes isn’t unheard of (Case in point: Another editor-beloved scent, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-7-virtues-vanilla-woods-perfume-fragrance-review"">7 Virtues’ Vanilla Woods</a>.) But as the name suggests, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/only-human"">Only Human</a> is all about tapping into the sensual alchemy of two people connecting — per the brand, it’s rumored to smell a bit different on everyone, <em>à la </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-glossier-you-perfume-new-formula"">Glossier You</a>.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/only-human"">Noyz Only Human 50ML</a>, $85 </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937307.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>I personally think that <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/only-human"">Only Human</a>‘s magic lies in its tightrope-like balance of sweet vanilla, spicy pink pepper, citrusy bergamot, and floral waterlily. At first spritz, the vanilla definitely comes through. But throughout the day, it dries down, leaving room for the floral and ambrox notes to emerge. As with all Noyz creations, you can choose (or indulge in all) from a <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/only-human"">50mL full size</a>, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/only-human?variant=50542921122075"">15mL travel spray</a>, and twist-up <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/the-solid-fragrance-only-human"">solid fragrance balm</a>. To say that I’ve found my favorite fall fragrance isn’t just fun alliteration — it’s a fact, thanks to Noyz.</p>
