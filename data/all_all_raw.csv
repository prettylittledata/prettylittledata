<p>It's no exaggeration to say that <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/renzo-piano"">Renzo Piano</a> is one of the most unanimously respected architects in the world of architecture. With an oeuvre that blends respect for context, lightness and technology to create environmentally conscious and aesthetically pleasing structures, his approach combines advanced materials with traditional techniques. In projects of various scales, the Genoese architect maintains an essential thread: the implementation of passive architectural strategies, highlighting the importance of these methods for sustainability and energy efficiency. This is often made explicit in his sketches, as an initial concern, and clearly comes through in the finished works. Here are some examples of iconic projects developed by his office in recent decades.</p>",

<h4>The question is no longer what AI might take from us, but how quickly we can hand it over.</h4><figure><img alt=""Scrabble tiles on a blue grid spell “FOMO,” emphasizing the sense of urgency and modern anxiety of missing out. Other tiles are scattered around."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MUaqGyzxim_7TGMDJaUMYQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image source: <a href=""https://workforceexperience.hp.com/blog/ai-fomo/"">https://workforceexperience.hp.com/blog/ai-fomo/</a></figcaption></figure><p>Like many professionals thinking about the future of design, I’m closely following the conversations around AI — both in public forums and in my own circles. But while many focus on the technical capabilities, I’m more interested in the broader narrative shaping these discussions. And recently, based on my observations, that narrative is shifting. The early fear that machines might erode the very qualities that make us human is giving way to a different anxiety—FoMO.</p><p><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563213000800"">FoMO — fear of missing out — is more than a buzzword</a>. Psychologists define it as the anxious belief that others are gaining opportunities or rewards that we’re excluded from. It’s not a fear of loss, but of being left behind while the world moves ahead.</p><p>It seems like only yesterday we were discussing <a href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/19/1075140/how-existential-risk-became-biggest-meme-in-ai/"">existential risks</a>, automation’s threat to work, and the unsettling possibility that <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/03/27/the-intersection-of-ai-and-human-creativity-can-machines-really-be-creative/"">creativity itself might be mechanized</a>. Now we talk mostly about how to “<a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/91278500/how-to-make-generative-ai-a-partner-in-your-daily-workflow"">integrate</a>” AI into our workflows, how to “<a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-stay-competitive-ai-era-openai-cfo-sarah-friar-2025-8"">stay competitive</a>,” and how not to miss the wave.</p><p>So what changed? Have we given up? Or have we simply convinced ourselves that AI won’t harm humanity. More likely, it’s because the rewards of this technology are immediate and obvious, while the costs are slow and subtle.</p><p>AI provides us speed, convenience, and capability — and it offers them now. But the erosion it causes creeps in quietly, almost imperceptibly. And because of this subtle degradation, we fail to treat it with the urgency it deserves.</p><p>However, out of all the potential consequences such as <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2025/04/25/the-jobs-that-will-fall-first-as-ai-takes-over-the-workplace/"">job replacement</a>, <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/03/27/the-intersection-of-ai-and-human-creativity-can-machines-really-be-creative/"">creative outsourcing</a>, and <a href=""https://technologymagazine.com/news/ai-giants-accused-of-the-largest-ip-theft-in-music-history"">intellectual theft</a>, what troubles me most is the silent replacement of human effort with efficiency— a trade that feels harmless in the moment but carries profound consequences over time.</p><p>Take students, for example — a group I see up close. Under the illusion they’re being efficient (or duplicitous in some cases), they utilize AI to generate ideas or complete work, outsourcing the most essential part of learning — the struggle.</p><p>When we skip the messy and difficult decisions that build the foundation of <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-importance-of-taste-and-other-lies-we-tell-ourselves-b5caacddbec4"">judgment</a>, we never develop the critical skills needed to distinguish strong work from weak.</p><p>Judgment is not something we’re born with, it’s something shaped by repeated trial and error. It takes root in wrestling with constraints, making mistakes, and steadily refining our instincts. Remove the struggle, and the capacity for discernment withers.</p><p>A clear example is someone using AI to build a simple landing page. If they don’t know how to code, they can’t judge whether the output is any good — they have to trust the system. Yet AI still makes errors, even on straightforward tasks like citing accurate sources. The same problem appears in design or writing, where assessing quality is even harder for those without expertise.</p><p>This is a major reason why <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16078"">seasoned professionals now hold a greater advantage than ever</a>—they have access to both the tools and the wisdom, while juniors have only the tools — tools that are steadily eroding their ability to gain valuable experience the way pre-AI generations did.</p><p>As individual discernment atrophies, the collective standard drops too. Across disciplines, the more AI fills the space with what many describe as “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_slop"">AI slop</a>”, the less we train ourselves to recognize what is excellent. Culture becomes saturated with “good enough” work that looks polished but lacks substance. Over time, we lose sight of what depth even is.</p><p>This is why effort matters. We stand in awe of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine_Chapel"">Sistine Chapel</a> or are moved by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-fFHeTX70Q"">Beethoven</a> not just because of their beauty, but because they embody human striving. They carry the weight of years, mistakes, and relentless pursuit.</p><p>If a machine produced the same artifacts tomorrow, they might be identical, but their meaning would evaporate. Without elements of human labor — physical or psychological — such art is reduced to decoration.</p><figure><img alt=""A person gazes at the Sistine Chapel’s intricate, colorful ceiling and wall frescoes, depicting biblical scenes with vivid figures and dynamic movement."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y6Q8NXeG2OXzz5fxAKOqzg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>What frustrates me most is that these aren’t side effects — they’re seismic shifts that demand serious attention. Yet our feeds are flooded with influencers and pseudo-experts insisting that AI is good because it frees us from “tedious” work for “higher-level” tasks. There’s some truth in that — yes, that’s how it <em>should</em> be used — but that’s not how it’s actually being used.</p><p>I know because I catch myself leaning on it for tasks I should be able to do — and do quickly — on my own, especially those that require a touch of humanity, like a sympathetic email to a colleague. Or shaping a big idea that should start with my own vision. It’s an unsettling tendency I’m confident others can relate to.</p><p>But all of these concerns are routinely dismissed as inconvenient footnotes to the next AI product launch. And this is all taking place while a <a href=""https://time.com/7322418/chat-gpt-open-ai-nvidia-tech-monopoly/"">handful of corporations</a> — companies like Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and OpenAI — are consolidating control over the infrastructure of culture itself. And we, as spectators, seem willing to watch as they chip away at what makes us human, all in the name of efficiency and our fixation on the next shiny innovation.</p><p>Maybe the most insidious part of this whole phenomenon is how normalized it’s become. Companies slap “AI-powered” onto products that don’t need it, like “gluten-free” labels on steak, because it’s easier to follow the trend than to ask if the trend makes sense.</p><p>Professionals and students panic that they’ll be unemployable if they don’t master these tools. Creatives worry they’ll be irrelevant if they don’t use them. And so everyone piles in — not out of conviction, but out of fear.</p><p>Conversations about purpose and meaning are being drowned out by the noise. These questions still surface, but they disappear beneath the hype faster than new AI startups can cash in.</p><p>And yet, for all this cynicism, hope isn’t gone. The technology is not destiny. It’s a mirror. It reflects our values back at us. If we allow convenience, speed, and efficiency to be our highest values, AI will amplify those — and hollow out everything else. But if we insist on preserving depth, effort, wisdom, and meaning, AI could become a tool that serves those ends rather than undermines them.</p><p>The choice is still ours, though it grows harder with each passing month. Words like these often echo unheard — and that may be the strongest reason to pause now. The real danger isn’t that machines will surpass us, but that in our desperation not to miss out, we’ll forget that being human means sometimes slowing down and doing things the hard way — because that’s how we grow.</p><p><strong><em>Don’t miss out! </em></strong><a href=""https://micbuckcreative.medium.com/subscribe""><strong><em>Join my email list</em></strong></a><strong><em> and receive the latest content.</em></strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=d628aacfb950"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/fear-of-missing-out-on-ai-is-overshadowing-the-fear-of-losing-our-humanity-d628aacfb950"">Fear of missing out on AI is overshadowing the fear of losing our humanity</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Every single choice, from storm drain placement to road approval, was a decision that left people out. Just as poor infrastructure creates physical barriers, unclear language creates digital barriers.</p><figure><img alt=""Minimalist illustration of a suburban street with a light grey asphalt road, a high sidewalk, a streetlamp, and green rolling hills under a light blue sky"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8j6He40LoOSgVN1e5a-8Uw.png"" /><figcaption>An illustration of a grey asphalt road bordered on the right by a high, light-colored sidewalk with a distinct, vertical curb — (Grant Yun).</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve recently become responsible for most of the UX writing on my product team, handling everything from button labels to complex error flows, and I know I’m not alone. In countless organizations, product designers are often the ones filling in the final text. Because this is usually the last step, it’s easy to treat the content as a quick fill-in, something you automate or even turn to AI to quickly generate.</p><p>Over time, I’ve realized that this perspective misses the point. <strong>The writing is the design.</strong> The rise of AI tools only makes this clearer: AI can generate text, but only a designer can generate strategy, empathy, and safety. When you view every word as a key design element, you move past simple writing and actually create the user’s experience.</p><p>For any designer who feels writing is just an extra task, this article shares a framework. It treats language as a core design function and the essential tool for building products that are usable, useful, and responsible.</p><h3><strong>Writing vs. Designing</strong></h3><p>When approaching a piece of content, most people immediately ask: <em>“How should those words be written?”</em> This is a tough place to start. Before you write anything, you must first think about designing the experience you want your users to have.</p><p>This is the key difference between the two mindsets:</p><ul><li>Writing Mindset asks: <em>How many words will fit here? How should I describe this action?</em></li><li>Design Mindset asks: <em>What problem are we solving? What terms are our users familiar with? What happens next?</em></li></ul><p>Writing is about fitting words together. Designing is about solving problems for your users. You cannot have one without the other; they must work together.</p><p>As Nicole Fenton, coauthor of <em>Nicely Said</em>, puts it: “<em>I use language to solve problems… I use words as material [1].</em>”</p><p>Your words build digital experiences. You are designing interfaces that allow people to pay bills, send emails, or order food. Every word included in those experiences directly shapes the user’s understanding, feeling, and outcome.</p><h3><strong>The usable useful responsible (UUR) framework</strong></h3><p>Designing with words is more than just arranging letters into sentences. To be truly effective, you have to think of your work not as a writing task, but as a design mandate. It demands skills far beyond basic writing.</p><figure><img alt=""The Usable, Useful, Responsible Framework text is shown above a large, yellow, four-stud building block (like a LEGO brick). The brick symbolizes the foundational components of the design framework."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hxr5i39R1NYwKkafChP-_A.png"" /><figcaption>The image shows a LEGO block, symbolizing the building block of a designer’s writing: the Usable, Useful, Responsible Framework</figcaption></figure><h4>1. Usable words</h4><p>When a product is usable, people can complete their tasks without needing help or instructions. For designers, creating usability means making sure your words act as a guide. The language itself must be clear so users can quickly finish their task.</p><p>This level of clarity is critical for everyone, but especially for those with cognitive disabilities, those who are stressed, or those using screen readers. As content design expert Sarah Richards says: <strong><em>“Accessibility is usability.”</em></strong> If your words aren’t easy for everyone to use, you’ve made a design choice that prevents some people from using your product [2].</p><p>Consider a simple login screen on a mobile app. The way the error message is written determines if the user can easily proceed:</p><ul><li><strong>Unusable writing (Poor design)</strong></li></ul><p>Login failed (<em>User is confused; they must guess if the email, password, or registration is the problem.</em>) (<em>User is offered no path forward.</em>)</p><ul><li><strong>Usable writing (<em>Good design</em>)</strong></li></ul><p>Email not registered. Sign up or check for typos. (<em>User knows exactly what is wrong: their account doesn’t exist.</em>) (<em>User is offered a clear, actionable solution: register or correct their mistake.</em>)</p><figure><img alt=""A comparison of two mobile login screens.

Useful words</h4><p>For your words to be useful, you need to understand and honor your users’ intent. Useful writing gives people control and prioritizes their needs, balancing them with business goals. When you respect users, they are motivated to keep giving you their time and attention.</p><p>For example, when a user intends to delete an account, useful writing must provide a clear path to complete that goal. A design that makes this process intentionally difficult through deceptive language is a classic example of making a product unuseful.</p><p><strong>Unuseful writing (User-hostile design)</strong></p><blockquote>“Hold On! Are You Sure You Want to Deactivate Your Profile and Lose Your Benefits?”</blockquote><p>Uses emotionally charged language, focusing on loss, to dissuade the user from their clear intent. Buttons: Cancel (Prominently styled, primary color) and Deactivate Later (Small, secondary color).</p><p>The issue here is it offers “Deactivate” instead of “Delete” to mislead the user into thinking the account is merely paused, retaining their data for marketing.)</p><p><strong>Useful writing (User-first design)</strong></p><blockquote>“Permanently Delete Your Account?”</blockquote><p>This is direct, unambiguous question honoring the user’s intent. Buttons: Yes, Delete Account (Clear, destructive) and Cancel (Neutral color).</p><p>It gives the user the necessary control and confirms the final, irreversible action.</p><figure><img alt=""A comparison of two account closure screens. The screen on the left, marked with an ‘X’, uses a dark pattern by asking the user to “Deactivate later,” making it difficult to find the option to permanently delete the account. The screen on the right, marked with a checkmark, has a clear title, “Permanently delete your account,” and a prominent red “Yes, Delete account” button."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*S6Kz54gsU90EUmzkt16HEA.png"" /><figcaption>A side-by-side comparison of user interfaces for closing an account, demonstrating good and bad design.</figcaption></figure><p>Useful writing focuses on what people want from your product or service and asks how you can balance that with business goals, rather than focusing purely on what the business can get out of it.</p><h4>3. Responsible words</h4><p>As a designer, you are responsible for what you put into the world. To write responsibly, you have to consider how your words could be used and, crucially, misused.</p><p>Irresponsible writing often weaponizes language. A popular example is “confirm-shaming,” where an interface asks a user for something (like an email) and then forces them to say or think something negative about themselves to decline.</p><figure><img alt=""Website footer featuring a newsletter subscription box that employs Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) text to pressure users into signing up to avoid “paying more” or missing “insider knowledge.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*542HwlftSE_p38Y_YDOlOw.png"" /><figcaption>A footer dark pattern example using fear of missing out (FOMO) and implied punishment (“paying more”) to pressure users into subscribing.</figcaption></figure><p>For instance, in a static footer that asks for an email:</p><ul><li>The headline creates anxiety: <strong><em>“Don’t be the last to know!”</em></strong></li><li>The subtext acts as the shaming mechanism: <strong><em>“If you’re okay with missing out on essential insider knowledge and paying more, just scroll on by.”</em></strong> This forces the user to internally validate that they are “okay with missing out” and “paying more” in order to ignore the field, making the act of declining feel like a financial or intellectual failure.</li></ul><p>As a designer, it’s your responsibility to consider not just how your writing will be used, but also how it could be misused, whether by an algorithm, others in your company, or malicious people. You must ask: <strong>Are they true? Are they kind? Are they inclusive?</strong></p><h3>Aligning your team before you write</h3><p>I’ve spent time with my team and stakeholders debating word choice. For example, should a button say “Buy” or “Purchase”? Stakeholders often look for a “best practice” answer: what does Amazon do? But asking this question is frustrating and distracts from the real issue.</p><figure><img alt=""A side-by-side comparison of two identical product cards for Wireless Headphones priced at ₦45,000. The card on the left uses a clear black button labeled “Buy.” The card on the right uses a black button labeled “Purchase”."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rm4pzevukAWkAjP4zpHePg.png"" /><figcaption>A visual comparison of product card buttons: one uses the clear, direct label “<strong>Buy</strong>,” while the other uses the more verbose label “<strong>Purchase</strong>.”</figcaption></figure><p>The right answer isn’t about being right or wrong. It’s about what works for your users and what your team needs to achieve. Before you can choose “Buy” or “Purchase,” you need a clear strategy.</p><blockquote>Strategy simply means getting everyone aligned on a shared focus. It tells the team what to do, and what to ignore.</blockquote><p>A simple strategy statement connects four key elements:</p><ol><li>User Type</li><li>User Need</li><li>Value Provided</li><li>Business Benefit</li></ol><p>For example:</p><blockquote><em>“</em>We help budget-conscious buyers easily acquire high-quality audio gear so they can enjoy superior sound immediately, which supports AudioFlow’s goal of increasing first-time conversions and positive word-of-mouth.”</blockquote><p>This statement immediately provides direction. Since the goal is easy acquisition for a wide, budget-conscious audience, choosing the clearest, most conversational word “Buy” over the more formal “Purchase” is the right strategic move.</p><h3>A framework for writing with AI</h3><p>The fundamentals of good writing are clarity, concision, and empathy, and they remain essential even with AI tools. While AI can draft text very quickly, its output often lacks soul. What makes UX writing truly effective is your ability to go beyond that basic text by understanding the user’s context, establishing a consistent brand voice, and skillfully modulating the tone.</p><figure><img alt=""A dark-themed AI chat interface with the text, “What are you working on?” and an input field labeled “+ Ask anything.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iFCaD0VnkoHsOfo6poGUtQ.png"" /><figcaption>The image displays a minimal, dark-themed AI chat interface</figcaption></figure><p>To integrate AI responsibly without compromising your voice, ethics, or craft, adopt a mindset where AI is a co-pilot used for generating options, while you the designer remain the pilot responsible for strategy and empathy.</p><p>Use this three-step strategic filter to integrate AI outputs into your workflow:</p><h4>1. Prompt with strategy</h4><p>Your input to the AI must be dictated by your established voice and tone documentation, not just your immediate need. Instead of a simple request like “<em>Write an error message</em>,” let your prompt provide a clear strategy like:</p><blockquote>“Write a toast notification message for a mobile app. The user just clicked an expired password reset link. Use a confident, empathetic, and direct tone. The message must tell them to request a new link, and it must be concise.”</blockquote><p>This single prompt bundles the following elements:</p><ul><li><strong>Voice &amp; Tone:</strong> “confident, empathetic, and direct tone”</li><li><strong>Constraint:</strong> “toast notification message for a mobile app,” must “be concise,” and must tell them to “request a new link.”</li></ul><p>The resulting AI output, <strong>“</strong><em>Your link has expired. Please request a new link to continue</em><strong>,”</strong> is a direct result of these layered instructions, showing how strategic input creates high-quality, on-brand UX copy right away.</p><figure><img alt=""An AI prompt and response about writing a confident and empathetic toast notification for an expired password reset link. The suggested text is: “Oops! This password reset link has expired. Please request a new one to continue.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*iR2uvwZpb93L_owDW2X_uA.png"" /><figcaption>A screenshot displays an AI prompt asking for a concise toast notification about an expired password link, instructing the AI to use a confident, empathetic, and direct tone.</figcaption></figure><h4>2. Filter for empathy (Review)</h4><p>The first and most critical step when reviewing AI output is to filter for the human element and inclusivity. AI outputs often rely on aggregated data that can perpetuate bias, use idioms, or assume an emotional state.</p><ul><li><strong>Check for Exclusion:</strong> Does the output use any terminology (gendered, ableist, or overly colloquial) that might alienate a specific population?</li><li><strong>Check for Assumption:</strong> Does the message assume the user is happy, smart, or calm? (e.g., avoid “Great job!” or “Finally!”)</li><li><strong>Check for Idioms:</strong> Is the language literal and ready for translation, or does it rely on cultural shorthand that an international user or machine translator would miss?</li></ul><figure><img alt=""An example of an AI simplifying an idiomatic English text for better translatability and clarity. The rewritten text is: “Thank you for signing up! You can now access all our features. We will guide you through how to use them quickly.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/933/1*8P0Dvi1e_uwQTQcPgm_3ZQ.png"" /><figcaption>The image displays an example of an AI being instructed to refine copy for translatability and clarity</figcaption></figure><h4>3. Edit for core principles (Output)</h4><p>After the output passes the empathy filter, focus on refining the language to ensure it is clear, concise, and authentically human.</p><ul><li><strong>Clear:</strong> Edit for ambiguity. Ensure the language precisely describes the action and the object. For example, does the button label “Save” mean “Save All” or “Save this section”? This clarity is paramount.</li><li><strong>Concise:</strong> Cut out extra words<strong>.</strong> Look at what the AI wrote and remove anything you don’t need, like long, overly nice phrases or confusing descriptions. These just slow the user down. Your main goal is to get to the point quickly so the user can finish their task fast and easily.</li><li><strong>Human:</strong> Finally, edit for rhythm by reading the final output aloud to check for natural cadence. Does the writing sound like a robot, or does it flow naturally with appropriate contractions and pacing? The human ear is the ultimate tool for catching stilted or forced language, ensuring the final tone is authentic and engaging.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""An example of an AI successfully applying UX writing principles (Clear, Concise, Human) to rewrite a long, passive sentence into the direct call-to-action: “Click the button below to save your work and keep your changes.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/841/1*wyYZ2s8cL7KKXuCCI19ZzQ.png"" /><figcaption>The image shows a conversation with an AI where the user is successfully using UX writing principles to edit a draft text</figcaption></figure><p>By following this three-step framework of strategic prompting, empathy filtering, and editing for clarity, concision, and human tone, you can use AI to create high-quality UX copy without losing your voice or affecting the user experience.</p><h3>Designing error messages that help users</h3><p>Error messages are often the most visible things we write, and they appear exactly when users are stressed and confused. While the best error is one that never happens, we must treat any error as a chance to help people finish their work.</p><p>When people use a product, they are focused on completing a task, not on figuring out how the app works. Running into an error is a hard stop to their goal. Instead of assuming the user is doing something “wrong,” your job is to design a better experience. <em>As expert Kathy Sierra says, focus on helping your users become “more skillful, more powerful users [3].”</em></p><h4>The problem with generic errors</h4><p>Companies often blame the user for errors as a way to protect their own image. However, error messages that quietly point the finger at the user and make them feel bad actually harm the brand, causing people to stop using the product and decreasing loyalty.</p><p>When the real problem is a technology or design failure, you should be honest. For example, the email service Mailchimp uses its distinct brand voice to be apologetic, transparent, and helpful when an error occurs. This approach shows they’re committed to guiding the user forward, not blocking them.</p><figure><img alt=""An example of transparent customer service communication from Mailchimp Support, acknowledging a server outage and setting expectations for a multi-hour resolution time."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/426/1*uVDnV1xXKW2ACp25PicWdw.png"" /><figcaption>The image displays an example of effective, honest error communication, characteristic of a user-first approach.</figcaption></figure><p>If something goes wrong, do everything you can to make sure your users aren’t taking the blame. Focus on helping them achieve their goal.</p><h4>The designer’s error framework</h4><p>To guide users through or around failures, you must design your language using three principles:</p><ul><li><strong>Avoid:</strong> The best error message is the one the user never sees. Use visual design and interaction (like autocomplete or automatic formatting) to prevent the error from happening in the first place.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Mobile address search interface showing real-time autocomplete suggestions to help the user find and select a location and avoid typing errors."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Aq6tX3Ha-83mo9V5ho_Vgw.png"" /><figcaption>The image shows an example of the avoid principle in the error framework, using interactions like autocomplete to prevent data entry errors</figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Explain:</strong> When an error occurs, clearly and quickly tell the user what went wrong and why (e.g., “Your return date must be after your departure date”). Never leave the user guessing.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Mobile travel booking form showing a date validation error. The return date is incorrectly set before the departure date, and an explicit error message explains the required date order to the user."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rHwhSDosSBAzaOZfIyT6SQ.png"" /><figcaption>The image shows a mobile screen for a travel booking app demonstrating the explain principle of the error framework.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Resolve:</strong> Easily the most critical component. Always provide a clear next step. Don’t just say “File too large”; say, “This file exceeds the 10MB limit. Try compressing the file or uploading a smaller version.”</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Mobile document upload screen showing a failed upload error for a PDF file that exceeds the 10MB limit, along with actionable advice to compress or upload a smaller file."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YRsg5H0dsboz3UNop3agrg.png"" /><figcaption>The image shows a mobile screen for uploading a document with an error, demonstrating the Resolve principle of the error framework</figcaption></figure><p>Your final task is to ensure the user is supported, not stalled, as they move toward their goal.</p><p>You’re now equipped to expose product flaws, justify your language choices with data, and ensure your product is usable, useful, and responsible.</p><p>AI will generate text faster than you can, but it cannot deliver empathy, define your brand’s ethics, or apply the strategic filter needed to build user trust. That level of intention remains your non-negotiable human power.</p><p>Embrace the words, embrace the strategy, and own your role as the ultimate experience designer.</p><h3>References</h3><p>[1] https://www.nicolefenton.com/words-as-material/</p><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nle2HbYTJU"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nle2HbYTJU</a></p><p>[3] <a href=""https://medium.com/building-winning-products/kathy-sierra-on-designing-for-badass-ba92cd5fad96"">https://medium.com/building-winning-products/kathy-sierra-on-designing-for-badass-ba92cd5fad96</a></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a8ccde162d35"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-writing-is-the-design-a8ccde162d35"">The writing is the design</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4><em>We changed our design mindset. We transitioned from building all the interfaces and prototypes to allowing others to develop their ideas in a safe place, following our design and product rules.</em></h4><figure><img alt=""lego pieces from the internet"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hlqhE85hxbODSNrRSZUXZw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Since we started embracing the “production acceleration stage” in the company, we see product design with fresh perspectives.</figcaption></figure><h4>Fully immersed in AI dynamics</h4><p>Like almost all technology companies today, we are influenced and affected by AI at our core. Part of this technology adoption has brought new company challenges <em>(ways of work, roles, technical knowledge, etc)</em>. Still, it has also led to many positive developments and ideas, allowing us to transform old problems into new opportunities.</p><p>Once AI was established as the new technology core, we are playing in a new, unknown field full of opportunities but also uncertainties. How do we build products now? How do we design? How do we work under new rules and roles? Those are questions that we don’t have a solid answer to yet, but in time, we will figure it out. The other side of the story is the opportunities AI will uncover if we choose to adopt this new approach with conviction.</p><p>This article explains how we <em>(a Latam HR rising start-up) </em>are innovating from a humble concept, an approach that has been positively adopted and significantly changed the way we work.</p><h4>From embracing AI to innovating with it</h4><p>Due to a company event (a hackathon), the UX team and I decided to build something special to present as pre-work. It was a fully functional chat interface made in Cursor for all teams to use and place their ideas, ensuring that whatever they create will maintain all Design System tokens and components. From this simple idea, something bigger started to grow after the event. We wondered what would happen if we decided to build a fully functional dummy platform where everyone could create, play, and share? That’s how the <strong>Product Playground</strong> was born — a simple tool that has already made us think about how we should work from now on.</p><h4>What’s a Product Playground?</h4><figure><img alt=""Papumba video game"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YadChw-B6H4iGTomC6tYEQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Building mode is a popular feature in video games like Fortnite, Fallout 4, The Sims, Minecraft, and Roblox, among others. It allows players to construct, customize, and manipulate structures and objects within a game world.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The concept is straightforward yet robust because of the transformations we are experiencing in this new AI field. The concept of having a place where everyone can “build ideas” connects with the spirit of the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXFTXsWsBfo"">building mode feature in video games,</a> where users can construct, customize, and manipulate structures and objects within a game world.</p><p>Having a “test or creation environment” in tech companies has, until now, been one that only engineers could use, so enabling everyone to use a test platform to create products easily was disruptive, at least for us.</p><p>The definition goes like this <em>(still in progress)</em>: The Product Playground is a local environment that “simulates” products in a fundamental way, in terms of their structure and composition <em>(gray boxes and text)</em>. The idea is that it can be a place to “play” with quick ideas and functionalities, enabling us to have rapid conversations with teams and users.</p><p>Each PM and designer will have their own Playground, enabling them to share with other teams and internal and external clients, thus receiving faster feedback in an environment closely resembling production reality.</p><p>While creating this new dummy world with my teammate, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-vega-ux/""><strong>David Vega</strong></a>, we realized the potential we could exploit from it, along with the new challenges of protocols and design handoff. To us, those concerns were beautiful problems to tackle if the idea could make an impact, and it did.</p><h4>How does it work?</h4><a href=""https://medium.com/media/74d837ecfd7676b18af2583ebf6cf610/href"">https://medium.com/media/74d837ecfd7676b18af2583ebf6cf610/href</a><p>Part of the essence of the Product Playground is to be really friendly to everyone outside the engineering team; therefore, we decided to build this Playground with some UX foundations. To start, there is a “read me first” section where users can understand all the knowledge behind this tool, such as the definition, step-by-step setup, templates, design validator, and tool documentation.</p><p>Once users understand how to operate the tool <em>(it is effortless, though)</em>, they need to pull the repository where the playground lives, and that’s it; you can start to play. We were also cautious in providing some initial prompts to make fundamental changes within the tool, and from there, the imagination is the limit.</p><h4>Scopes and levels of solutions</h4><figure><img alt=""Playground interface"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lsXnttQ2K2uFwdgSDDF3Gw.png"" /><figcaption>Current Product Playground (home) interface with navigation and functional sections ready to be modified</figcaption></figure><p>We started small, as we always do when building products. So far, we have launched the first version of Product Playground and achieved our primary goal: to spark interest in creating products and sharing ideas among people. We believe this version shouldn’t be the end, so we are planning to evolve the AI tool into something more interesting. Here’s the evolution scope we’re planning:</p><p><strong>Phase one:<br /></strong>Mission: “Play and Share”<br />Contains the following features:</p><ul><li>Local environments</li><li>Local component library in Cursor (Design System tokens + components)</li><li>Playground publishing</li><li>100% responsive</li></ul><p><strong>Phase two:<br /></strong>Mission: “Real components, real environments”<br />Contains the following features:</p><ul><li>React environments (Collaborator + Admin)</li><li>Actual company library (MCP: Figma + tokens + components)</li><li>Playground publishing</li><li>100% responsive</li></ul><p><strong>Phase three:<br /></strong>Mission: “Company Standard Code”<br />Contains the following features:</p><ul><li>React environments (Collaborator + Admin)</li><li>UBITS library (MCP: Figma + tokens + components) + rules</li><li>Playground publishing</li><li>100% responsive</li><li>Code reviewed and optimized for engineering.</li></ul><p>We believe that with this AI tool or concept, our way of understanding product building has changed. From our company’s perspective, we see a lot of benefits to highlight, such as:</p><ul><li>Functional designs and ideas that can feel more real in their iterations.</li><li>Speed ​​in idea validation <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/did-ai-kill-the-systems-thinking-skills-in-ux-701f845f18d4""><em>(acceleration stage)</em></a>.</li><li>Shift from the “traditional” mindset that says I must rely on third parties to validate or create something.</li><li>Independence when building product experiences from an idea.</li><li>Engineering inputs; in more advanced phases of the Playground, the components and layouts will be the official ones from the company libraries.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Plagound interface"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/853/1*3qzuJFndKCkNLQpSBpwR3A.png"" /><figcaption>Interface exercise with real elements and components of the design system</figcaption></figure><p>We acknowledge that not everything is rainbows and sunshine. With this new way of building products, we anticipate some big questions and challenges, such as the role of a designer as we know it <em>(I’ll explain it in a few paragraphs)</em> and whether the new handoff method will be a Product playground link. What should happen with Figma files? Do we even need it since now we have a new construction platform? The reality is that we’re discovering answers as soon as we move with this idea. I hope to get you an answer in my next article.</p><h4>A new design mindset?</h4><p>As I mentioned at the beginning of this article, we’re experimenting with a possible design mindset shifting process; how do we know? With this new tool, interface design is not just a job for professionals; it’s for everyone. As a result, our design duty may shift to something unfamiliar: the design of systems, or as we’ve started to call it, <strong>Infrastructure design.</strong> We’re not pretending to add another design role to the already confusing list in the industry, but in scenarios like this, naming what we are building gives us ownership of ideas and processes.</p><p>Infrastructure design, as we understand it, involves the planning, design, and maintenance of a large product platform where others can come to build. Our priority right now is to provide all the building blocks <em>(Design system, user experiences, interactions, etc.) </em>to allow others to create. So immediately we launched the Product Playground, a worry started to circle our minds; with this tool, our design job will disappear? This is a valid question due to the significant hysteria in the design community since AI has become a permanent presence. My answer to that is no; there are still many things a designer can do that no one else can. The issue until now is that we have allowed companies to pigeonhole our work as only an interface exercise, and I believe it is more than that.</p><p>At the end of the day, if someone is creating stuff in a Playground, it is the designer who decides if such an invention is easy to use, coherent with user needs, and meets other relevant criteria.</p><p>Along with this “new concept” that only applies to design teams, there is another one with a broader scale that we are adopting, and I’d like to share: <strong>functional design</strong>. This concept refers to the Playground outcome, where ideas are essentially functional and ready to implement. We’ve abandoned static design and limited prototypes for rich interactions and complete flows that can be made in minutes.</p><p>When we talk about design now, we can see things working in a real environment and have more effective conversations with users and stakeholders. The sense of reality is a plus we haven’t had before.</p><p>Another topic we have been navigating and evangelizing within the design team is embracing “designs” from others, especially from those who are not designers. To clarify, the Product Playground is not open to everyone in the company, but only to people in the tech department <em>(PMs, sales, data, engineers, QA, etc). </em>The message is simple on this concern: What was once an insult to us as designers is now real collaboration. We can exchange design and experiences, and also teach them how to do it in the process.</p><h4>The new company’s way of working.</h4><p>Since we started embracing the “production acceleration stage” in the company, we see product design with fresh perspectives, especially with the Product Playground in the conversation. It may not be the right or only path to follow in the industry, but for us, it’s been quite a change.</p><p>The most compelling evidence we have to validate our hypothesis is time. Before all these concepts <em>(Acceleration stage, Product Playground, Infrastructure design, and functional design)</em>, building an idea went like this: Ideation → Model → Prototype → Engineering. The cycle was slow, expensive, and discouraged innovation, as typically only one idea was developed. Now, a process that used to take weeks only takes a few hours. Plus, we can test multiple versions of an interface quickly, preventing ideas from falling by the wayside.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=22f64e1bc59a"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-ai-concept-that-changed-our-companys-way-of-working-22f64e1bc59a"">The AI concept that changed our company’s way of working</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Gregory Bateson and the art of staying in conversation with yourself.</h4><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white portrait of an elderly man with light hair swept back, wearing a plaid shirt over a collared shirt. He has a gentle, knowing smile and expressive wrinkles that convey warmth and intelligence. The background is softly blurred, keeping focus on his face and thoughtful expression."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*k9P22tQEKIhurkG8V8E1CA.png"" /></figure><p>This week, someone asked me a question that deserves more than a quick answer:</p><blockquote><strong>How can a company get bigger without making the experience worse for the people who already trust it?</strong></blockquote><p><em>I’m </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/natesowder/""><em>Nate Sowder</em></a><em>, and this is unquoted, installment 10. Today, we’re talking mergers and acquisitions.</em></p><p><strong>At first, it sounds like a design problem.</strong> Or maybe a customer service one. Add new markets, new systems, new customers, and suddenly the challenge is keeping what was working while trying to understand what the future needs to become.</p><p>But underneath, it’s a question about honesty. What if the kind of growth that stretches empathy and deepens awareness (the kind we expect from people) could guide how organizations grow too? The trouble is, and it’s what I was really being asked, companies don’t usually grow that way. The bigger they get, the more they drift toward dilution. Uniformity starts to look like fairness. A drive for efficiency starts to feel like understanding. And every merger, no matter how strategic, risks erasing the small, specific things that made people trust you in the first place.</p><p>Which brings us to Gregory Bateson, the British anthropologist who spent his life asking how living systems hold together when they grow, collide or change. He called it <a href=""https://batesoninstitute.org/gregory-bateson/""><em>the ecology of mind</em></a>. His insight was simple… aaand difficult:</p><p><strong>Systems survive by staying in conversation with themselves.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white photograph of anthropologists Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson working at a wooden table in their thatched-roof home near the Sepik River in New Guinea.

Trained as an anthropologist, he moved through biology, psychiatry, cybernetics and communication theory as if they were chapters in a single unfinished book. He studied tribes in New Guinea, mapped communication patterns in families with schizophrenia, and helped define the early vocabulary of systems theory.</p><p>What he was really searching for was what he called the ‘pattern that connects’. Every living system, he argued, survives by registering difference — the small shifts that signal when something in the environment has changed. To Bateson, information was a relationship that needed to be maintained. It wasn’t something you could create and store away.</p><p>He saw life as a constant negotiation between something you are aware of and something you let drift. The moment a system stops sensing its surroundings, it begins to lose the capacity to learn. And what we often call stability is just the early phase of decline. In other words, if you aren’t working toward something, you’re automatically moving away from it.</p><p>That was the core of his thinking. He replaced the language of control with the language of relationship. A forest, an organization, even a mind. Each stays ‘alive’ by keeping the conversation open between its parts.</p><h3>When the conversation breaks</h3><p>Bateson’s ideas make mergers look less like transactions and more like ecological events. Two systems collide, each with its own rhythms, feedback loops and internal grammar. At first, both listen politely. Then they start talking over each other.</p><p>Signals that once made sense begin to distort. Teams over-interpret silence. Customers catch tonal shifts before any official announcement. That doesn’t mean the system is collapsing. What it means is that it’s losing its sense of self.</p><p>Bateson would’ve seen that as a feedback failure, not a leadership flaw. When new information enters a system and the interpretive loops are weak, the signal mutates (it doesn’t go away). Meaning goes looking for somewhere else to live.</p><p><strong>That’s the unseen cost of getting bigger.</strong> Growth multiplies ways to do things faster than it multiplies ways to understand things. And the louder a system gets, the easier it is to confuse agreement with coherence.</p><p>You’re probably thinking what I’m thinking: Every organization faces this… not just in mergers, but technology adoption, strategy, and research.</p><p>We build tools to listen faster, but not always to listen better. Bateson would call that <a href=""https://www.honest-broker.com/p/why-gregory-bateson-matters-a8d"">ecological deafness:</a> a feedback loop optimized for speed instead of reflection.</p><h3>Learning from differences</h3><p>Bateson believed that systems stay healthy by adjusting to the relationships between things. Every change, no matter how small, reshapes the conditions for what comes next. As a system receives information, the key isn’t how much it hears, but whether the hearing leads to reflection.</p><p>AI makes that harder. It expands what an organization can sense, but not what it understands. Algorithms pull in more signal, faster… but they don’t know what matters. And often, neither do we.</p><p>We’ve trained ourselves to think that hearing more means knowing more. But without a loop that turns signal into learning, it’s just a whole lot of noise.</p><p>Bateson’s answer would be:<br />- Humility. <br />- Keep the conversation open. <br />- Build systems that reflect before they respond.</p><h3>Staying in conversation with yourself</h3><p>It’s not that organizations fail because they stop collecting feedback. It’s more that they learn how to ignore it.</p><p>Even with dashboards, surveys, sentiment trackers… it’s easy to bend the story in whatever direction feels most comfortable.</p><p>A forest doesn’t get to do that. It doesn’t negotiate with fire, or spin a drought into a branding opportunity. It just responds.</p><p>Bateson’s point was that healthy systems don’t control the narrative.<br /><strong>They stay in conversation with it.</strong></p><p>If you want to grow without losing what made you trustworthy, build that kind of system.</p><p>Then let it tell you the truth. Even when you’d rather not hear it.</p><p><strong>The work is ahead.</strong><br />And Bateson shows us the way.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=631d44184013"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-ecology-of-a-merger-631d44184013"">The ecology of a merger</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>How designers create true alignment with visual thinking</h4><p>I want to tell you about my favorite apple. It’s incredible. It’s hands down the most delicious apple of all time! When you see it hanging on a tree, its color invites you to come closer and take a bite. When it’s ripe, the flavor is amazing, complemented with a delightfully pleasing texture. It’s a fantastic fruit that fills you with delight.</p><figure><img alt=""Hand draw picture of an apple shape with questions around it"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*dfRMi0iyg9vrfJYA.jpg"" /><figcaption>What kind of apple are you imagining?</figcaption></figure><p>Now, what kind of apple did you imagine? Was it red, green, or yellow? Was the taste tart, sweet, or mild? Where did you imagine that tree…in a field, backyard, or in an orchard? Every person reading this description has a different kind of apple in mind. Yet, we’re all speaking the same language, using the same terms to talk about the same apple. The language is the same, but the ideas in our heads are different.</p><p>This is what I call the “illusion of alignment,” and it doesn’t just happen with apples. It happens all the time in meetings, design reviews, planning sessions, emails, strategy documents and more.</p><h3>The Illusion in Action</h3><p>Imagine a product team spends weeks planning a major feature redesign. Everyone attends the kickoff meeting. The product manager presents the strategy doc. It’s thorough. It’s well-written. It covers all the bases. Heads nod around the room. Engineering gives a thumbs up. Architecture gives green lights. UX flashes a smile. The scope is clear. The goals are documented. Everyone agrees this is the right direction.</p><p>You take notes, ask a few clarifying questions, and get to work. Over the next several weeks, you explore concepts, refine the direction, and build out the solution. It feels good. It feels aligned. The check-ins go smoothly. Then comes the first design review…</p><p>The designer presents their work…the culmination of weeks of thinking, exploring, and refining. And the room… erupts. Not with excitement. With confusion. With concern. With frustration.</p><blockquote>“Wait, I thought we agreed on something simpler?”</blockquote><blockquote>“This isn’t what I had in mind at all.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Why did you go in this direction?”</blockquote><p>Everyone feels blindsided. The designer is confused because they followed the strategy, they asked questions, they thought everyone was aligned. The product manager is frustrated at the designer…clearly they didn’t read the brief. The leaders are worried…we’ve lost weeks, and now we have to start over. Engineers are annoyed since they’ve been planning their work around a completely different approach.</p><p>What happened? Everyone was using the same words the whole time. Everyone read the same document. Everyone nodded in the same meetings. But nobody was actually imagining the same thing.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Dyx0umta-Pm9z48R.jpg"" /><figcaption>Words are not the same as meaning.</figcaption></figure><h3>Words Are Squishier Than We Think</h3><p>Words are not concrete. As much as we want words to have specific, concrete, absolute meaning…they don’t. They’re abstractions that our brains automatically fill in based on our backgrounds, expertise, and experiences. Two people can use identical terms and mean completely different things. Two people can use wildly different terms and mean the <em>exact </em>same thing.</p><p>This shows up in a few different ways. Here are three examples:</p><p>The problem gets worse with documentation. We write things down and feel confident. Look, it’s right there on the page. It’s clear. It’s specific. But even detailed specifications get interpreted through different mental models. Your brain reads those words and instantly constructs an image based on what you know, what you’ve seen before, and what makes sense to you. Our brains make assumptions about the words and between the words to make sense of what we’re reading.</p><p>This isn’t because people are stupid or careless. This is human nature. It’s just how our minds work. It’s how we engage with and understand the world. We can’t help but fill in gaps with our own understanding.</p><h3>The Division It Breeds</h3><p>Before that design review, everything feels fine. There’s harmony in meetings. People are nodding. Documents are approved. Progress is being made. High fives all around. But underneath, an invisible gap is slowly widening. Everyone is building on different assumptions, creating different mental models, imagining different end states, and digging a deeper gulf between each other.</p><p>Then the designer shows their work and suddenly the gap becomes visible. What felt like alignment evaporates like a vapor. That alignment was simply an illusion.</p><p>Trust erodes. The designer feels like the goal posts just moved. The product manager feels ignored. Developers feel annoyed. Everyone questions everyone else’s competence. What was a collaborative team suddenly feels like a war zone.</p><p>We don’t just have a project setback, we have a relationship problem. People start documenting everything defensively. Politics emerge. Finger-pointing begins. The project screeches to a halt as everyone grasps for control of the situation.</p><p>This is what survival looks like. Everyone is genuinely trying to do the right thing. The division wasn’t intentional, it was invisible…until the pictures showed up.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*vYbB6DOAo9yKRECo.jpg"" /><figcaption>Pictures get closer to meaning.</figcaption></figure><h3>Designers as Bridge Builders</h3><p>The pictures. That’s where clarity started to emerge. This is where designers have a unique opportunity. We think visually (or at least we should). We externalize ideas in renderings to make sense of them. We don’t just imagine solutions in our heads, we sketch them, analyze them, erase them, trash them, and sketch some more. We refine them, prototype them, and make them feel more real. We make the invisible visible.</p><p>This puts us in a very opportunistic position. We can expose misalignment before division deepens. We can build bridges between abstract language and concrete forms. We have a chance to drive direction and clarity. We don’t need special authority or permission. We don’t need a “seat at the table”. We just need to do what comes naturally to us: draw.</p><p>A designer with a marker and a napkin can create more alignment in 1 minute than weeks of documented strategy. Not because the strategy is bad, but because the drawing makes everyone’s different mental pictures visible. It forces the misalignment to the surface early, when it’s still easy to correct. It grounds us in what could be, to drive the question of what should be.</p><p>This isn’t about gatekeeping or controlling the conversation. It’s about getting people to talk. It’s about helping everyone see the different pictures in each other’s heads so we can get really get aligned before we waste time, money, and relationships building the wrong things.</p><h3>Tactics for Creating Real Alignment</h3><p>This should be second nature for designers. But, it’s easy to get sucked into the practices and thinking of non-designers around us.</p><p>If this is new to you, or you’re looking for some helpful approaches, here are practical ways designers can use visual thinking to build bridges across different scenarios:</p><p>The goal of these isn’t to finalize decisions. It’s to avoid hidden assumptions and misalignment that will paint you into a corner later and undermine the value you’re delivering to users.</p><h3>Just Draw a Picture</h3><p>Remember our favorite apple from the beginning? The one we imagined differently even though we used the same language? It looks like we’re aligned because we’re talking about an apple. Even if we start talking about details, we still appear to be aligned. It’s not until concrete renderings are introduced that the true state of alignment is shown. This is where the practice of design shines. Every strategy session. Every kickoff. Everyone’s got a different apple in their head. We can help draw it out.</p><figure><img alt=""Hand draw illustration of a marker"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*TYuQ0iT4r6EzcFQP.jpg"" /><figcaption>Grab a marker and just draw a picture for clarity.</figcaption></figure><p>This doesn’t require process overhaul, you can do it any time. It doesn’t need expensive tools, you just need a pencil. It doesn’t require anyone’s permission, just some courage on your part. We need to do what comes naturally to designers: think visually. Make ideas concrete. Turn words into form. Show, don’t just tell.</p><p>There’s been a lot of talk over the years about designers needing a seat at the table. I don’t believe you need to be at the table to influence the people at the table. You need to create artifacts that create shared understanding, and show the path forward. You need to be the one who makes what’s invisible visible before the division breeds and relationships fracture. If everyone at the table is aligned going in, you don’t have to be there to try and align them.</p><p>We’re surrounded by a world addicted to speed and productivity. Some may think drawing is a waste of time, or inappropriate for “serious business discussions,” or something you do later in the “design phase.” They won’t naturally reach for a marker. But we will. Because we’re the ones who instinctively know that pictures are worth 1,000 strategy documents, and pictures create the concrete to help us understand the wicked problems we’re asked to solve.</p><p>Next meeting, bring a sketch. Even a crude one. Spend 5–10 minutes thinking with your pencil and be ready to share. Be the bridge builder. Be the one who weeds out hidden assumptions by creating alignment.</p><p>Pickup your pencil, and get after it!</p><h3>One More Thing…</h3><p>You may get really frustrated when you spend time and energy understanding the problem and proposing a solution only to have it ripped apart over and over again. Or you may work hard on identifying and rendering the best solution and people tell you all the reasons why it’s wrong. You may get frustrated after months into a project and things suddenly go sideways and your project partners decide that it’s the “wrong” direction.</p><p>It’s a horrible feeling and one of incredible frustration. It might feel like you can never get anything right. But I want you to know: as a designer that’s your job. It’s our job to propose and work through solutions and constantly be searching and rendering our thinking. We make the intangible tangible so people can understand it. You make the intangible tangible so we can build it if that’s the agreed path. If you propose a solution, or many solutions, and people disagree, you’ve done your job. Consider it a success if you draw a picture or prototype and people disagree with it. That’s your opportunity to find alignment and find the path forward.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4d8f661e63f0"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-illusion-of-alignment-4d8f661e63f0"">The illusion of alignment</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

While the colorful leaves make for stunning wedding photos, finding fall wedding guest dresses can be tricky. The goal: something elevated, seasonally appropriate, and comfortable enough to carry you through hours of celebrating (and dancing).<br /><br />Ahead, we’ve rounded up 24 statement-making fall wedding guest dresses that work for dipping temperatures (think: maxi lengths, long sleeves, and rich fabrics) and every kind of venue (think: luxe halls, breweries, or lakeside). Expect autumnal florals, sweet puff sleeves, and slinky satin picks. Whether you need an elegant gown for a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-tie-wedding-guest-dress"">black-tie affair</a> or are craving a trendy <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/arrange-asos-brand-plus-size-review"">plus-size dress</a> for a casual ceremony, your perfect look is just a click away.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

And while rest is essential for staying in tip-top shape both mentally and physically, it’s also when your skin gets to work.</p>



<p>That’s right: When you’re enjoying your trip to snoozeland, that’s when your skin gets hard to work — which is what inspired Nocturnal’s hero serum.</p>



<p>“If you’re not getting the proper sleep your body needs, cortisol levels remain high, interfering with cellular activities like wound healing, and even skin hydration,” dermatologist Joshua Zeichner, MD, tells Refinery29. “This even can contribute to acne breakouts.” Founded by beauty industry veterans Katey Hassan and Daniel Kiyoi, Nocturnal’s <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/UBAGQESK/products/polar-night-renewal-serum"">Polar Night Renewal Serum</a> is smart, luxurious skincare in a bottle — and it’s definitely not your everyday night serum. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.linkby.com/UBAGQESK/products/polar-night-renewal-serum"">Polar Night Renewal Serum</a>, $178</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938218.jpg?width=910&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=455%3A512"" /></figure>



<p>Packed with peptides, niacinamide, oat-derived lipids, and evening primrose, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/UBAGQESK/products/polar-night-renewal-serum"">Polar Night</a> is made to brighten, hydrate, and address signs of aging. However, the most notable innovation IMO lies in a patent-pending delivery system — which actually matters so the potent ingredients you’re paying for get readily absorbed by your skin. But at the end of the day, all of the fancy technology in the world doesn’t matter if my skincare doesn’t yield results.</p>



<p>I may not have wrinkles and fine lines yet (I’m 32, but still get routinely asked if I’m still in college — a slight annoyance that I will one day love, I’m sure), so I can’t speak much to the fine line-reducing ability of Polar Night, but I will say that my overall bounciness and texture have vastly improved since incorporating this into my PM routine. (I even keep it on my nightstand to reapply right before bed.) In the morning, I wake up with soft, smooth skin that isn’t screaming for moisture.</p>



<p>And here’s the thing: Is it expensive? Yes. However, I always recommend investing in your serum or moisturizer (as opposed to cleansers) since they tend to be more concentrated in actives and stay on your skin for a longer period of time. The 30mL full size lasted me a few months with nightly use, and I just replaced it with a <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/UBAGQESK/products/polar-night-renewal-serum-refill?variant=43293817143484"">refill pod</a>. (Which, when the packaging is as gorgeous as Nocturnal’s, it genuinely makes me want to reuse it forever.) And since I’ve been using Polar Night, I’ve haven’t wanted to book a facial or invest in richer moisturizers since my skin is already happy and hydrated. Serums that work smarter <em>and </em>harder? Here for it.</p>

<p>We’re now in the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-fall-candles-2025-latine"">middle of fall</a>. The onset of Scorpio season lands in the depths of fall for the Northern Hemisphere. As we dive into the simmering waters of Scorpio, we’ll feel more connected to others because our hearts and minds will be open. We have the opportunity to realize our dreams and we will be lucky enough to be happy with the outcome. Read on to discover the spooky and sweet vibes that will be coming in the month ahead.<br /><br />As a fixed <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/water-signs-zodiac-traits-explained"">water sign</a>, Scorpio is known for devotion and loyalty. The scorpion, who will sting with their poisonous venom when hurt, is extremely intuitive and highly aware of their surroundings. Scorpios wear their hearts close to their chest and suss people out before letting them in. In the days ahead we are going to decide who and what is worth investing our energy into. Being cautious will lead to us being comfortable around the people we trust. </p>



<p>The decaying leaves dropping off the trees remind us of our own mortality. Scorpio is the sign of sex, death, taxes, and evolution and we will be monitoring our personal advancementł. This is a time to make the shifts that have been on our minds. The winds of change are having a profound effect on us. We hold the power to our success and joy. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/manifest-goals-2025-zodiac-signs"">Manifesting our goals</a> will be easier. Like the crops being picked, our visions will soon be a reality. With two retrogrades (Mercury and Jupiter) and a potent Super Full Harvest Moon, we’ll contemplate our next moves and reflect on the past. </p>



<p>The feeling to watch out for is jealousy. On October 24th, when the Sun squares Pluto, we may be consumed by the green-eyed monster. This feeling might be projected onto others, or we could be the victims of it. Scorpio energy can bring out our dark side. We need to make peace with shadowy emotions by embracing our inner child and recognizing these our feelings for what they are. We should love these parts of ourselves in an effort to temper and heal them. By using our innate strength and stamina, we can create a better state of being for ourselves. Be gentle and sympathetic to others and yourself as you float through the enigmatic waves of Scorpio season.</p>



<p>Key Astrological Dates For Scorpio Season: <br /><br /><strong>October 22nd:</strong> The Sun enters Scorpio, starting a month of transformation. Our emotions will get deep, urging us to commit.<br /><br /><strong>October 29th:</strong> Mercury moves into Sagittarius, making communication direct and upfront — no more mincing words.<br /><br /><strong>November 4th:</strong> Mars glides into Sagittarius, pushing us to chase our independence and embrace adventure. <br /><br /><strong>November 5th:</strong> The magical Super Full Moon in Taurus illuminates the sky and highlights our sensual desires.  </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939013.jpg?resize=150%2C150"" /></figure></div>



<p>Let me start by saying this: I am <em>not</em> a sports girl. Never have been. I danced as a kid, I work out, but anything that involves a ball and coordination? Count me out. So when <a href=""https://usapickleball.org/"">USA Pickleball </a>invited me to <a href=""https://www.sandals.com/south-coast/?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=104221446&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD4_U5AhxrctAUMq2uzoLE8kEywU5&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw6bfHBhDNARIsAIGsqLjkljtYkno35KSzZW5OFnvIzuxguWYbDOHKgW_w-WY_uOvjewusxnwaAqYXEALw_wcB"">Sandals South Coast</a> in Jamaica for World Pickleball Day, I was equally excited and terrified.</p>



<p>But after one week of sun, sweat, and intense fun, I get it. I finally understand why everyone’s obsessed with pickleball.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Sandals was named <a href=""https://www.sandals.com/pickleball/"">USA Pickleball’s Official All-Inclusive Resort,</a> and we were there to celebrate the partnership and test out their brand-new courts. From the moment we arrived, they rolled out the red carpet: new rackets, balls, and enough <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pickleball-gifts"">pickleball merch</a> to fill a carry-on. Jamaica is already my favorite island so getting to play my first-ever game in paradise was an unreal experience.</p>



<p>Before we jumped into games, our coach gave us a crash course in Pickleball 101. We started with the basics: how to hold the paddle, how to serve, how <em>not</em> to send the ball flying into another court (which I may or may not have done). My biggest struggle? Figuring out how hard to hit. My brain kept wanting to play tennis, I was reminded over and over: <em>no wrist flicks, no power swings, just a light tap.</em></p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939014.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>If I’m being honest, I was almost more excited about my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/08/11488863/pickleball-fashion-outfits"">pickleball fits </a>than the actual sport. On day one, I wore a cute tan set that immediately betrayed me. I had visible sweat marks all over my body and let’s just say I was no longer the girl with the cute fit on the court. I was drenched in sweat, and my cute court outfit was a distant memory. But by day two, I came back strong in a white cropped tee, white tennis skirt, bucket hat, and sunnies. Looking cute on the court was an instant confidence boost. I actually started getting the hang of it.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939015.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>By the end of the week, I was into it — like, “maybe I’ll join a pickleball league” level of into it. It’s social, easy to learn, and doesn’t leave you feeling like you just survived bootcamp. I totally get why everyone from your parents to your favorite celebs can’t stop talking about it.</p>



<p>I also have to give Sandals its flowers. I’m usually not an all-inclusive resort girl, but this trip changed my mind. Between the food, the vibes, and the fact that they have everything you need to pick up a new hobby (paddles, balls, courts, and lessons), it’s the perfect setup for both chill and play.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939016.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>I went to Jamaica thinking I’d sip cocktails by the pool and maybe try this pickleball thing once. Instead, I got my cardio in, made new friends, and found a sport I actually like. So yeah, consider me a convert.</p>



<p>If you’ve been side-eyeing the pickleball hype like I was, take this as your sign: grab a paddle, find a court, and try it for yourself. Just… don’t wear tan.<br /></p>

<p>On the first day of her first job out of college, Olandria Carthen, aka Bama Barbie, walked in and was struck with one thought: <em>I’m the only one who looks like me. </em>Not only were there no women, but there weren’t any Black folks. </p>



<p>“In that moment in time, I had to remember: Tuskegee literally prepares you for moments like this,” says the beloved reality star, model, and aspiring entrepreneur, on the latest episode of <em>Go Off, Sis</em>, in partnership with <a href=""http://target.com"">Target</a>, about how her Historically Black College and University (HBCU) experience prepared her to face the realities of working in the elevator industry — one that’s very white and very male. “I fell into a mini post-college depression. Imagine going from an all-Black classroom to being the only Black person in the office. But I feel like Tuskegee showed me how to adapt to those types of environments and how to network. I had to remind myself: Never shrink yourself in the presence of others to make them feel more empowered.” </p>



<p>Carthen never expected to find herself in sales at an elevator company (she graduated with a degree in supply chain management), but her disarming charm — plus her Tuskegee education — set her up for success. In just a short time, she was outperforming her peers, knocking out one goal after another. It’s that same charm that not only won over her significant other — Nicolas Vansteenberghe — on arguably the most-watched reality TV show program of the summer, but also fans all over the nation. </p>



<p>“When I was on that show, I knew I was representing more than just myself — I’m representing Black women as a whole. So, going on there and knowing my self-worth, my value, and  self-acceptance truly helped me navigate this space,” she says. “Knowing I have so much support from my community, or just from all women, means the world to me.”</p>



<p>Listen to the full podcast episode during which Carthen chats with Kathleen Newman-Bremang, senior content director of entertainment at Refinery29; Sandy Pierre, brand partnerships lead at Unbothered; and Claire Ateku, social producer at Unbothered about Homecoming season, how she’s handling fame, Nicolandria, and more. </p>

<p></p>



<p>Get ready to sizzle! The day before <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2024-meaning-effects"">Scorpio season</a> begins, October 21st, brings a super intense New Moon in Libra. Relationships and money are shifting and itching for evolution. The cosmos is asking us to define our aspirations and inclinations. <br /><br />The Moon’s orbit around the Earth takes nearly a month to go from New to Full. The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lunar-wellness-cycle-meaning-black-women"">lunar cycle</a> begins when the Sun, Moon, and Earth are in line with each other, with the Moon facing Earth bearing no light from the Sun. As a result, a Dark Moon happens. A New Moon occurs astrologically when the Sun and Moon form a conjunction in the same sign and degree. The union of the two is a balance of the conscious (Sun) and the unconscious (Moon). We are attaining harmony in our identity and feelings. They dance together, allowing us to find our sense of self and our purpose.<br /><br />The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/weekly-horoscope-19-october-25-2025-meaning-effects"">New Moon in Libra</a> gives us clarity on who we want to partner with and the strength of vision to cut ties with those we do not. Regardless of our chosen avenue, we are gearing up to make tough decisions regarding matters of the heart. Exciting partnerships could develop, encouraging us to lean into romantic notions. We might also consider balancing various parts of our lives to achieve harmony and peace of mind. Finances could come into play, and we should ensure we stick to a budget and do not overspend. The overall message is to embrace relationships and lifestyles that lift us and allow us to grow. Emotional safety is necessary, so tighten the foundations and build toward a better place.</p>



<p>The lunation occurs in the latest degree of Libra, the 29th, called anaretic degree. This brings a messy vibe and the need for immediate change. We might show our tempers if our patience is exhausted. Additionally, the New Moon squares Jupiter in Cancer, expanding our sentimental and passionate horizons. Although this sounds amazing on paper, we might overindulge in our desires, making it challenging for others to relate to us or vice versa. While we wish to scream our feelings from the rooftops, it may be best to subdue them as a form of energetic protection. Saturn retrograde in Pisces initiates a minor frustrations within this lunation. Basically, we should slow our roll. <br /><br />Yes, we’re in love with life — but it’s advisable not to shoot our shot too quickly. We should wait until we have100% confidence in matters. Think of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/october-2025-tarotscopes-process-release"">Fool tarot card</a>; one misstep backwards brings catastrophe. Speaking of tarot, this lunation is associated with Justice and the Two of Swords. Justice represents the Sun in Libra, and the Two of Swords correlates to the Moon in Libra. The combination of these cards is another warning against rushing in — even though Jupiter is strongarming us and making us believe that haste is a good idea. Meditate for a hot minute about what truly speaks to your spirit. The more impetuous we are, the less we listen to our intuition, and intuition is key right now. </p>



<p>This is the first moment we’ve had that pushes us to manifest — last month’s eclipses caused too much frenetic energy for us to see straight, so we paused on setting intentions. Now is the time to take a leap toward our goals and make moves to secure our bag for the future. Whether committing to a ‘ship or starting a project, be sure to center your energy on the ideas that inspire and motivate you to be the greatest version of yourself. The truth is, the only way to do fantastic work and to live up to your potential is to love what you do and who you spend your time with. It’s that simple!</p>

<p>This week begins with a wave of beauty, balance, and intention-setting as the New Moon in Libra arrives on October 21, opening up a 10-day portal to re-center and recalibrate. The New Moon is ruled by <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-libra-horoscope-october-2025-meaning-effects"">Venus, who’s just come home to Libra</a>, adding a layer of divine ease and elegance to the cosmic weather. Think of this lunation as your official invitation to simplify your life, clear emotional clutter, and call in relationships that reflect your growth, not your patterns. Even if the world feels chaotic, this is a window where the inner world can start to feel a little more in rhythm — one breath at a time. <br /><br />But don’t get too comfy, because the next day, on the 22nd, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/libra-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Libra Season</a> ends, and on the 23rd, the depths of Scorpio Season rise up to meet us. That shift alone — from Air to Water, from surface to soul, from curation to catharsis — is a reminder that life moves in layers. We’re at a threshold, a moment between what’s light and what’s heavy, and the astrology this week is here to teach us that we don’t have to pick one or the other. We can live and let live, love and let love, <em>and</em> still honor the shadows that live within us. This isn’t a week of either/or. It’s both/and. <br /><br />And here’s the plot twist: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars, Scorpio’s ancient ruler, is also in Scorpio</a>, intensifying our instincts, sharpening our focus, and stirring our deepest desires. When both Venus and Mars are in their home signs, it’s like the divine feminine and divine masculine are having a private convo about where we’re really headed. Passion meets poise, truth meets tenderness, and we’re being asked to integrate it all. The version of you who craves connection and harmony gets to co-exist with the one who’s finally ready to stop pretending and speak from the soul. </p>



<p>Also on October 22, Neptune retrogrades back into Pisces at 5:51am EST for its final visit to its home sign — a placement it’s held since July 2011. That’s 14 years of dreaming, dissolving, romanticizing, escaping, and sometimes deceiving ourselves. So let’s pause here: <em>What were you longing for in 2011 that still lingers in the background of your life today? What illusions have been too sweet to let go of? What delusions have actually protected you, and which ones are now blocking your growth?</em> Neptune’s final retrograde through Pisces is here to help us differentiate between being delulu and finding the solulu, and that lesson is as spiritual as it is sobering. <br /><br />And it’s not just personal… this retrograde affects us on a collective level, too. With Saturn also recently re-entering Pisces, and the North Node currently transiting Pisces (until 2026), there’s a massive wave of Piscean energy shaping our intuition, our ideals, and our imaginations. That means questioning media narratives, cultural myths, and the stories we’ve been spoon-fed. It means trusting your gut, even when the facts aren’t clear. And above all, it means reclaiming your spiritual sovereignty. The answers don’t always arrive through logic — sometimes they live in a poem, a dream, a flash of insight, or the moment your body relaxes for the first time in days. <br /><br />This week is about trusting the quiet truth inside you, even if you’re still figuring out how to name it. It’s okay to change your mind. It’s okay to want solitude one minute and to feel wildly social the next. Conversations will be both hilarious and profound — the kind that make you laugh until you cry and cry until you laugh again. And the more grace you offer yourself through this integration process, the more you’ll be able to offer it to others. We’re all riding this wave together. No one’s doing it perfectly. </p>



<p>So lean into the beauty. Let yourself desire peace. But don’t be afraid to feel the edges of your longing, too. Let the Libra New Moon remind you that healing doesn’t always look like shadow work — sometimes it’s a playlist, a pretty dress, a flirty glance, or the moment you decide to forgive yourself for being human. And let Scorpio Season’s arrival remind you that transformation can be tender, and it’s okay if you’re not ready to share the full story just yet. You’re allowed to evolve quietly.<br /><br />Because this week? It could all be so simple — and it gets to be. <br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>You’ve been pretending not to care, Aries, but the Libra New Moon on October 21st is calling your bluff. It’s happening in your partnership sector, and with Venus also in Libra, it’s time to admit that yes, you want softness. You want connection. You want someone who sees you and doesn’t flinch. Whether you’re in a relationship, navigating a situationship, or feeling completely solo — this lunation wants you to pause and check in: <em>What kind of love are you calling in?</em> You get to rewrite your expectations and begin again. It’s okay to let yourself want more: more harmony, more depth, more reciprocity. That doesn’t make you weak; it makes you wise.<br /><br />Then, two days later, the vibe shifts completely as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/10/10719292/scorpio-season-october-2021-meaning-effects"">Scorpio Season</a> begins on the 23rd, lighting up your sector of merging, intimacy, and long-term investments. This is about more than sex (though, yes, that too). This is about legacy. About who you’re building with. About what you’re merging your energy, resources, and soul with and why. With Mars, your ruling planet, in Scorpio, you’re operating with more instinct and intuition than usual. You’re not showing all your cards. You’re observing, planning, feeling more private, and more potent. That can feel disorienting for a Fire sign, but it’s medicine. Let your decisions simmer. Reassess how you spend your energy and who you trust with your heart, your body, your secrets. Scorpio Season is about power, not performance. </p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, your body knows. Your spirit knows. Your routines know. This week’s Libra New Moon on October 21st is like a soft reset for your wellness, work, and rhythm sector, and it’s reminding you that healing isn’t supposed to feel like punishment. It’s supposed to feel like <em>alignment</em>. That means going to bed at a decent hour, turning your phone off an hour before sleep, choosing ginger tea over scrolling, and saying “no” without guilt. With Venus, your ruling planet, also in Libra, this is your chance to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-libra-horoscope-october-2025-meaning-effects"">romanticize your wellness</a>. Make your water fancy. Play jazz while you fold clothes. Eat your snacks before 8pm. You already know what needs tweaking — this lunation just gives you permission to actually <em>do it</em>. And yes, small changes count. <br /><br />But then the tempo changes: Scorpio Season begins October 23, activating your relationship sector and inviting you into the realm of real connection. And not the Instagram kind — the deep, soul-mirroring, “why are you in my dreams” kind. With Mars also in Scorpio, your desire for depth in partnership is doubled. It’s cinematic and intense. You may find yourself magnetically pulled toward people with Scorpio placements, or just craving more <em>presence</em> from the people already in your life. But the challenge? Don’t lose yourself in the sauce. Remember your rituals. Stay rooted in your values. You don’t have to prove you’re lovable. You just have to be present. </p>

<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>This Libra New Moon on October 21st is a love letter to your inner child, Gemini. It’s a fresh start in your creativity, romance, and play sector, and it wants you to do what actually feels good. Remember hobbies? Remember flirting for fun? Remember making things just because you felt like it? That’s what this lunation is about. Venus in Libra is also holding your hand, reminding you that ease can be productive. That joy is part of your path, and that laughter heals. This week, say yes to the dance class, the art project, the silly text, the cartoon rewatch, the solo karaoke in your bathroom mirror. Give your inner child the wheel for a bit. They know the way. <br /><br />Then, once Scorpio Season begins on October 23, your energy gets more serious — but in a helpful way. Scorpio lights up your sector of wellness, habits, and systems, and Mars in Scorpio gives you the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-improve-focus"">power to focus</a>. You’re not just dabbling anymore. You’re getting your sh*t together. And yes, that might feel a little overwhelming at first — the structure, the schedule, the responsibility — but it’s so necessary. Think of this as your season of refinement. What systems do Future You need in place? What boundaries? What daily rituals? Treat discipline as a form of devotion, not restriction. You’re not doing this to limit yourself — you’re doing it to <em>free yourself</em>. </p>

<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You can’t decorate over a wound, Cancer. This week’s Libra New Moon on October 21st lands in your home, healing, and inner foundation sector, and it’s gently guiding you to tend to what’s beneath the surface. Maybe that means rearranging your room so it feels more like a sanctuary. Maybe it means having a long <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/talking-to-family-relationship-disapproval"">talk with a family member</a>. Maybe it means journaling the thoughts you usually keep hidden. This isn’t about appearances — it’s about <em>alignment</em>. With Venus also in Libra, you’re supported in creating beauty and balance where things have felt off-kilter. Let this lunation be a reset for your nervous system. You’re allowed to begin again, even if you never got the apology. Especially if you didn’t.<br /><br />Then comes the glow-up: Scorpio Season kicks off October 23, activating your sector of joy, pleasure, romance, and creativity for the next four weeks. This is your permission slip to <em>feel yourself</em>. To flirt, to play, to create. With Mars also in Scorpio, your sensuality is magnetized, but so is your creativity. You’re not just craving fun, you’re craving depth <em>within</em> fun. Art that moves you, love that consumes you, moments that feel like magic. Just don’t forget: the muse needs rest, too. Protect your energy, and your intuition. The next four weeks are about remembering what brings you back to life and refusing to settle for anything less. </p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The Libra New Moon on October 21st is a social, stimulating reset for you, Leo. It’s lighting up your communication, curiosity, and connection zone. Conversations flow easier this week, and you may find yourself reaching out to people you’ve been meaning to text back since… August. With Venus also in Libra, charm comes naturally to you (yes, even more than usual). You could be asked to collaborate, speak, teach, or write something that finally gets your ideas the attention they deserve. Say yes to anything that feels light, exciting, and reciprocal. This lunation wants you to remember that words are spells, so choose the ones that align with where you’re headed, not where you’ve been. <br /><br />Once Scorpio Season begins on October 23rd, the vibe shifts inward. Your attention turns toward your home, your emotional safety, and your sense of belonging. It’s less about how you’re <em>perceived</em> and more about how you <em>feel</em> when the lights are off and no one’s watching. With Mars also in Scorpio, family dynamics, domestic decisions, or living arrangements may need attention. But instead of reacting, try responding. Scorpio Season is about moving from pride to presence. About anchoring yourself in the small, sacred rituals that keep your heart steady. Decorate your space. Reconnect with your roots. Make home feel like peace again. </p>

<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, this week’s Libra New Moon on October 21st is whispering “stability” — not in a boring way, but in the “let’s actually feel safe in our bodies and our money again” kind of way. It lands in your finance and self-worth zone, encouraging you to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2025"">treat your energy like currency</a>. Where are you investing your time, your attention, your money, your heart? Do those investments still align with your values? With Venus also in Libra, you’re being guided to reconnect with the pleasure of abundance — not hustle for it. Maybe that looks like budgeting with grace, paying yourself first, or simply believing you’re allowed to receive without overexplaining. This lunation wants you to see yourself as the asset.<br /><br />Then, Scorpio Season begins on October 23rd, shifting your attention to your communication and learning sector. You’re not just observing anymore — you’re analyzing, processing, and saying the things that others are too scared to. With Mars in Scorpio, your words carry weight, and your intuition about people is almost eerie. Don’t use that power to overthink or prove yourself — use it to connect. Journal your thoughts. Have the difficult conversation. Take the class or trip that’s been calling to you. Your mind is a portal right now. Speak from the heart, and it’ll reach exactly who it needs to. </p>

<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>We’ve made it to <em>your</em> annual new moon week, Libra, and it’s one of the most beautiful cosmic resets of the year. On October 21st, both the Sun and Moon meet in your sign, with your ruler Venus also cozy at home in Libra. Translation? This is a full permission slip to live and let live, love and let love. You don’t have to earn peace; you can choose it. You’re not being superficial for wanting beauty or harmony — you’re remembering that those things heal you. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-zodiac-sign-2025"">Set intentions</a> that celebrate who you’re becoming rather than fixating on who you used to be. This lunation is a mirror moment. Look closely. You’ve grown more than you realize. <br /><br />By October 23rd, when the Sun slides into Scorpio, the tone deepens — and your focus turns to your values, resources, and inner self-worth. You might notice where you’ve been over-giving, or where your generosity hasn’t been matched. Don’t spiral… Just rebalance. With Mars in Scorpio, it’s time to get practical about your goals. Where do you want to build lasting stability? What’s worth your emotional bandwidth? Scorpio Season helps you refine what “abundance” really means to you. Sometimes, it’s money. Sometimes, it’s peace. This next chapter teaches you how to protect both. </p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio Season begins this week, babe! You can feel it coming, can’t you? But before we get there, the Libra New Moon on October 21st feels like the inhale before the exhale — a quiet clearing in your healing, rest, and reflection zone. You may crave solitude more than usual, and that’s not isolation… it’s preparation. With Venus also in Libra, your soul is recalibrating before the spotlight returns to you. This week’s new moon wants you to release the pressure to do everything at once. Rest is the ritual, closure is the work, and forgiveness is the reset. Give yourself the stillness your spirit’s been asking for, and watch how naturally the inspiration flows back in. <br /><br />Then, on October 23rd, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2024-meaning-effects"">it’s officially </a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2024-meaning-effects"">your</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2024-meaning-effects""> season, Scorpio</a>. The Sun enters your sign, and so does the main character energy. With Mars, your ancient ruler, also here, your magnetism skyrockets. You’re bold without trying, mysterious without forcing it, and on some level… people just <em>know</em> not to play with you right now. But with that power comes a choice: will you lead with love or control? This next four-week chapter is about mastering your intensity — not dimming it. Say what you want, own what you desire, and move like you’ve already shed what needed to go. It’s transformation season, and you’re the divine template. </p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The Libra New Moon on October 21st lands in your community and social goals sector, Sagittarius — and it’s giving “soft launch your reinvention” energy. This is the moment to remember you’re allowed to be known in new ways. You may feel drawn to refresh your brand, update your online presence, or pitch that creative idea that’s been living in your Notes app. With Venus also in Libra, friendship becomes a love language — so lean into the joy of collaboration and platonic intimacy. Whether it’s scheduling a girls’ night, finding a new creative crew, or saying “yes” to something that terrifies you <em>just a little</em>, this is a portal to deeper alignment. Don’t ghost your future self. <br /><br />By October 23rd, when Scorpio Season begins, your mood turns reflective. This is your annual “soul sabbatical” — when the Sun illuminates your closure, subconscious, and healing zone. You may feel more sensitive or sleepy than usual, especially with Mars in Scorpio intensifying your dreams and instincts. Use this time to untangle what you’ve been carrying that isn’t yours. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/casual-relationship-rules-boundaries"">Set boundaries with the energy drainers</a>. Tend to your inner world like it’s your most sacred altar. The magic of this season isn’t loud — it’s hidden, behind-the-scenes, preparing you to rise again in late November. For now, rest <em>is</em> productivity. </p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The Libra New Moon on October 21st is blessing your career and visibility sector, Capricorn, and it’s your cosmic cue to step into the spotlight — but on your own terms. What do you <em>really</em> want to be known for? Who do you feel called to become? This lunation, with Venus also in Libra, helps you approach your ambition from a place of harmony and alignment, rather than grind and guilt. Pitch the bold idea, apply for the role, speak up in the meeting. It’s not about proving anything — it’s about <em>remembering</em> what you bring to the table. You’re building a legacy. Let this new moon reflect that.<br /><br />When the Sun enters Scorpio on October 23rd, the energy pivots toward your friendships, networks, and long-term dreams. Suddenly <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dating-relationship-connection-vs-compatibility"">you’re craving connection</a> — but not the surface-level kind. With Mars also in Scorpio, you’re being guided to deepen your bonds or lovingly release what’s no longer aligned. This season helps you call in your soul tribe — the people who see your power and remind you of your softness. Whether you’re building something new, joining a cause, or just having a long-overdue heart-to-heart with a friend, Scorpio Season is your reminder: success is sweeter when it’s shared. </p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, the Libra New Moon on October 21st arrives with lightness and lift — activating your exploration, truth, and belief sector. It wants you to zoom out. To remember that life isn’t only about responsibilities and goals, but also about adventure, serendipity, and soul expansion. This is a beautiful week to plan a trip, take a course, or follow a philosophical rabbit hole that intrigues you. With Venus also in Libra, you might even fall for someone with a different background or worldview. This lunation is about freedom. Say yes to what expands your heart, and say no to what keeps you small. <br /><br />Once Scorpio Season kicks off on October 23rd, your focus shifts to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/career-horoscope-2025"">your career, reputation, and long-term impact</a>. With Mars in Scorpio, your drive to succeed sharpens, but so does your tendency to burn out if you’re not being honest about what success <em>means</em> to you. Scorpio Season asks you to build more than just your resume. It asks you to build trust. Build truth. Build something that won’t crumble when things get hard. Keep your vision, but let go of the masks. The real you? That’s the version the world’s been waiting for. </p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The Libra New Moon on October 21st is an intimate one for you, Pisces… it takes place in your sector of merging, transformation, and shared resources, which means you may be reflecting on the emotional (and financial) ties in your life. Who are you sharing your energy with, and why? This lunation, paired with Venus’ current transit in Libra, helps you navigate these waters with grace, honesty, and softness. Whether you’re deepening a relationship, releasing an entanglement, or calling in a more balanced dynamic, the message is clear: don’t settle for anything that doesn’t feel <em>sacred</em>. You’re worthy of depth that doesn’t drain you.<br /><br />By October 23rd, when the Sun enters Scorpio, the mood lifts slightly — but it also gets <em>real</em>. This is your annual call to expand, both spiritually and literally. With Mars in Scorpio, your curiosity is on fire. You’re craving truth, adventure, and deeper meaning. Whether it’s planning a spiritual retreat, writing your truth, or diving into metaphysical studies, Scorpio Season activates your philosopher mode. But it’s not about escaping. It’s about understanding the hidden patterns that guide your life. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-is-intuition-psychic-spiritual-meaning"">Let your intuition lead you</a> somewhere that pleasantly surprises you and helps you expand your possibilities. </p>

It’s finally time for Target’s annual designer collaboration, and this one stands out from its most recent slate, like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/target-kate-spade-collaboration-shop"">Kate Spade</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/target-diane-von-furstenberg-collaboration-lookbook"">DVF</a>. This time, the reader-favorite retailer has partnered with the nearly 200-year-old <a href=""https://www.woolrich.com/us/en/"">outdoor lifestyle brand Woolrich</a> on an ultra-cozy, adventure-ready, and dare we say: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPzeJaZk-pX/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA=="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">lumberjack-chic collection</a>. <br /><br />Beyond buffalo-check womenswear and menswear — which Woolrich popularized — you can fully embrace your adventurous side out on the trails or in your humble abode with a range of Target-exclusive accessories, homeware, outdoor gear, and food and drinks. Think: <a href=""http://goto.target.com/55rXmn"">landscape-printed fleece zip-ups</a>, <a href=""http://goto.target.com/GKWAoE"">sheep-covered pillows</a>, <a href=""http://goto.target.com/EEB5GX"">binoculars</a>, and new <a href=""http://goto.target.com/2aDGXD"">maple syrup Kodiak pancake mix</a>.  So while Woolrich’s high-quality and durable apparel may typically cost you a pretty penny, this Target collaboration makes the heritage brand’s designs (and expanded categories) more accessible to a broader audience — with most price points falling under $40.<br /><br />“Woolrich x Target is all about fashion meeting function to help consumers embrace the outdoors in style,"" said Jill Sando, Target's executive vice president and chief merchandising officer, apparel &amp; accessories, home and hardlines in a press release. ""From the <a href=""http://goto.target.com/e1zOBg"">Quilted Sheep Tote Bag</a> to the <a href=""http://goto.target.com/mOMDrD"">Buffalo Check Outdoor Wearable Throw</a>, to the amazing <a href=""http://goto.target.com/jebM2a"">inflatable kayak</a>, and so much more, I love how Target and Woolrich have worked together to create something that's fun and affordable.""<br /><br />The classic utilitarian aesthetics and functional features get a playful Target spin à la vibrant colorways, playful sheep graphics, printed reversible styles, and even a campaign shot in New York to show how Woolrich’s designs can translate into “modern urban style.” So whether you break up your buffalo check ""Pennsylvania tuxedo” with a graphic tee, cargo pants, or quilted skirt, you’ll look and feel confident taking on camping sites <em>or</em> bustling crowds. <br /><br />Woolrich’s creative director, Heekyun Kim, said in the release: ""This collaboration with Target represents an exciting opportunity to introduce our iconic designs, like our legendary buffalo check, to a new generation of explorers. We are proud to create a collection that honors our archives while making the Woolrich spirit of adventure accessible to all.”<br /><br />The collection officially drops <strong>tomorrow, October 18 at 3 a.m. EST</strong>, but you can preview the 100-plus item range now.<br /><br />Click on to see our favorite <a href=""http://goto.target.com/EEB5xX"">Target x Woolrich collaboration</a> looks so you can add to cart ASAP with a plan!<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

<p><em>Welcome to</em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/money-diary""><em> Money Diaries</em></a><em> where we are tackling the ever-present taboo that is money. We’ve partnered with</em><a href=""https://www.klarna.com/us/""><em> Klarna</em></a><em>, the financial services company that offers the</em><a href=""https://www.klarna.com/us/klarna-card/""><em> Klarna Card</em></a><em> that can be used two ways — as a traditional debit card anywhere Visa and virtual payments are accepted, or as a flexible pay-later option — allowing its users to feel empowered and in control of their spending. </em></p>



<p><em>Today: </em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ayanahyman""><em>Ayana Hyman</em></a><em>, a 23-year-old Los Angeles-based content creator, uses her Klarna Card to buy essentials like groceries (adulting!) and little things that make her happy.</em></p>



<h2>Day One</h2>



<p>9 a.m. — My alarm clock goes off. I immediately hit snooze and sleep for another hour. Classic. I eventually peel myself out of bed at 10 a.m. and then I remember: I live in Los Angeles now(!!), and that gets me hyped for the day. Moving here has been my dream for forever, and even though I’m all settled in now (I moved a couple months ago), it still feels surreal. </p>



<p>10:30 a.m. — I wash the crust out of my eyes and do my morning skincare routine while bumping to my favorite tunes. I absolutely have to start the day with music pumping through my veins — it’s my way of grounding myself in a new city that honestly still <em>feels</em> new.</p>



<p>1:15 p.m. — I go to my favorite torture class — pilates — and sweat outrageously for an hour. I’ve actually met some of my new friends here. Moving to a new city can be lonely, and it’s been a challenge putting myself out there, so it feels good to start recognizing some familiar faces. <strong>$40 </strong></p>



<p>2:15 p.m. — I grab a container of mangoes — definitely a little pricey, but they make my day every time. Worth it. <strong>$15</strong></p>



<p>6 p.m. — I have a random craving for BBQ, so I order some and it <em>bussed zownnn</em> (as it should for 86 whole dollars!!). Did it taste like comfort? Absolutely.<strong> $86</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $141</strong></p>



<h2>Day Two</h2>



<p>11 a.m. — I start my day with a morning croissant and matcha that I order straight to my door. Matcha is definitely a <em>non-negotiable </em>on heavy editing days. I’ve been a content creator for four years now, and I’ve learned that little treats, like matcha, are just the thing I need to keep going. <strong>$30 </strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — It’s a full hair wash day today: washing, blow drying, and braiding, which kind of feels like the Hair Olympics. I blast music and chat with my mom, which makes the time go by much faster.</p>



<p>5 p.m. — Finally done and I reward myself with a home-cooked meal of chicken, potatoes, and crab claws. It’s a weird combination of dishes, I know, but comfort food always reminds me of home back in Atlanta.  </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $30</strong></p>



<h2>Day Three</h2>



<p>7:30 a.m.  — It’s an early start today because I’m going to a workout class with the girlies I met at pilates. Yay for new friends.</p>



<p>10:30 a.m. — I’m a sucker for cute workout clothes and the workout studio has the <em>CAY-UTEST</em> top. I buy it, of course. <strong>$30</strong></p>



<p>1 p.m. — After our workout, we all get lunch. I only order one smoothie and a croissant, and somehow that’s $30, but I guess that’s LA for ya. I’m still learning how to manage my money out here (social spending versus staying home), but these little hangs definitely make the city feel less lonely. <strong>$30</strong></p>



<p>4:30 p.m. — I spend the afternoon editing content I’ve been procrastinating on. It’s just been sitting in my phone for weeks (oops). I eat a freezer dinner and decide to call it a day. Welcome to the unglamorous side of content creation. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $60</strong></p>



<h2>Day Four</h2>



<p>12 p.m. — I have a brand dinner tonight, and I spend the entire morning thinking about my outfit. When I have something to look forward to, my brain can only think of that one thing for the rest of the day.</p>



<p>3 p.m. — I don’t need to leave until 6:30 p.m., but I start getting ready now, because I’m a professional dilly-dallier. The earlier I get ready the better, because I don’t want to be late — tonight’s event is with one of my favorite Black-owned beauty brands.</p>



<p>6:45 p.m. — Told you! I’m finally ready and leave for dinner. The event is <em>stunning</em>. Moments like these remind me of why I moved out here. I’m living the life I’ve always imagined.  </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $0</strong></p>



<h2>Day Five </h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937459.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>12 p.m.— I get dressed to go to the nail salon — only for them to turn me away because they’re all booked for the day (cue the dramatic <em>nooooo</em>). </p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — Instead of heading home, I take myself on a solo movie date. In Atlanta, I would be hanging out with my sisters or friends. Sometimes being alone feels a bit harder in a new city, but I’m learning to enjoy my own company. And this beats doing chores, so I don’t regret my decision at all. <strong>$43</strong></p>



<p>7 p.m. — I end the night by FaceTiming with my mom, aka my long-distance bestie. I always feel lighter after chats with her. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $43</strong></p>



<h2>Day Six</h2>



<p>2 p.m. — It’s Self-care Saturday. Translation: bed-rotting and doom-scrolling for hours. Sometimes you just need to do nothing. </p>



<p>4:30 p.m. — If I want to make it to the next day, I’m going to need some food in my house, so off to the grocery store we go, where I buy ingredients for a few recipes I have in mind, plus a little bouquet of flowers to brighten my home. To be completely honest, grocery shopping is an adulting task that I’m still getting used to.<strong> </strong>The total amount is a lot, but I justify it because it’ll be cheaper than eating out. And by using my Klarna Card, I can easily track how much I’m spending in the app. And the beauty of this card — and how it differs from other cards — is that I can use it two ways: as a regular debit card wherever Visa or virtual payments are accepted (so, <em>pretty much </em>everywhere) and as a way to plan for a bigger purchase and pay later. </p>



<p>I first learned about Klarna in college. I would buy clothes, and with Klarna, pay the amount in installments. Making smaller payments was just easier (also, girl math), and I felt more in control of my spending. And so I love that I still have that ability to plan for purchases with the Klarna Card, except now, I can use it virtually anywhere and for virtually anything (instead of being limited to select merchants that have Klarna at checkout). <strong>$146</strong></p>



<p>7 p.m. — My mom talks non-stop about this pasta recipe she’s always making nowadays, so I take a shot at making it with my newly purchased ingredients. And she wasn’t exaggerating — it’s <em>good. </em></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $146</strong></p>



<h2>Day Seven</h2>



<p>10 a.m. — I show up to the nail salon because I made an actual appointment this time (#womeninstem). And my nails came out so cute. I simply tap to pay using my Klarna Card (#blessed). <strong>$112</strong></p>



<p>2 p.m. — As much as I want to order food because I don’t feel like cooking, I lace up my big-girl boots and make a lettuce wrap with the groceries I bought earlier. Who’s proud of me? (Me haha).</p>



<p>5 p.m. — Sundays are all about comfort. And it just so happens that <em>all </em>of my favorite shows air on Sundays. So you can find me on my couch for the rest of the night — it’s a ritual that reminds me of home, even if home is now thousands of miles away. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $112</strong></p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937453.png?width=1024&amp;height=688&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=64%3A43"" /></figure>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>“I must confess: I don’t usually track my spending, so I honestly thought that I’d spend <em>way</em> more this week. But I feel good about where my money went. Most of what I spent was on little things that made me happy — like flowers or a matcha or a cute workout top — which feels like the best kind of spending. But I’m also very much aware that regularly dining out can add up, which was why I started to make a concerted effort to cook more at home this week. Keeping track of everything helped me see where my money was going, and using my Klarna Card gives me the flexibility to pay now or plan a purchase to pay later.”</p>

Certain merchant, product, good and service restrictions apply. Some merchants do not accept virtual cards. Physical card only included with a paid Klarna Membership Plan</em>.</p>
