Dolphins and ichthyosaurs, for example, are separated by millions of years of evolutionary history, yet both evolved nearly identical hydrodynamic bodies.

<p>MVRDV has completed construction on the Pujiang Platform, a <strong>viewpoint comprising an arched, earth-covered timber pavilion perched among the hills</strong> to the south of Chengdu. The project serves as both a <strong>visitor destination and an event space </strong>that takes advantage of the spectacular natural beauty of central China. Designed to <strong>blend into nature</strong> while also standing out as a beacon when seen from the plains below, the <strong>structure of earth-covered timber arches</strong> takes a telescopic shape, drawing visitors to the expansive viewing window and balcony that projects out over the slope.</p>",

<h4>Our brain is a prediction machine that can’t be stopped. No matter how hard we try, it will still build expectations.</h4><p>If you’re reading this, you’ve probably asked yourself the same question I always have: What exactly makes users subconsciously follow <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279871278_Color-in-Context_Theory"">Color Psychology</a>, <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles?srsltid=AfmBOopi3ws2HhTLq5t9k-4j8DcE9Ef_W6XddNvGAqidJSuDQZDW4XU4"">Gestalt principles</a>, and behavioral patterns like <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/hicks-law/"">Hick’s law</a>? Why does all of this work? Is there a way to understand the true nature of our brain and not just how it reacts, but why it predicts, expects, and perceives the world the way it does?</p><p>Now it’s time to go one level deeper — into the core of how our brain actually works. In this article, we’ll touch on one of the fundamental theories that helps me personally answer these questions, and I would love to share it with you. Buckle up, we’re shifting into nerd gear!</p><h3>The Free Energy Principle</h3><p>In 2010, in his paper <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2787"">The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_J._Friston"">Karl Friston</a> formally introduced a theory stating that every system, including living organisms, strives to minimize free energy. Simple enough: we don’t like surprises. But let’s take a closer look at what that really means.</p><figure><img alt=""Portrait of neuroscientist Karl Friston, author of the Free Energy Principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*SSE0hdbj4PtpTqh7.jpg"" /><figcaption>Karl Friston, Photo by Kate Peters (<a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/karl-friston-free-energy-principle-artificial-intelligence/"">WIRED</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The brain’s main task is to minimize the gap between expectation and reality. This gap is what the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle"">Free Energy Principle</a> defines as free energy. When the brain encounters unpredictable input, its stress level rises. And it’s crucial to understand: this isn’t about you as a person or a “user”, it’s about your brain. It’s not something we consciously control, but it’s something we can use.</p><p>After all, as humans, we don’t always chase predictability or comfort. Many people enjoy physical exercise, even though it’s technically stress for the muscles. We love movies with unexpected plot twists, and even comedy works by placing us in a familiar setup and then adding an unpredictable punchline.</p><p>That’s because we’re more than just our brains. The human organism and our consciousness is a complex system of subsystems, including our hormonal system, which can reward the brain with the right chemistry under stress, or reinforce behavior when we act in line with its internal “program.”</p><p>So, the Free Energy Principle is actually quite a complex theory, and there are different mathematical interpretations of it. But for simplicity and convenience, today we’re going to look at a more accessible formula:</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram of the free energy equation with each variable labeled."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OltXx93fAkWg9_8i2HvACw.png"" /></figure><p>We can break it down into several key variables:</p><ul><li><strong><em>F</em> </strong>— variational free energy: this is the result of our brain’s calculations. For the brain (or any predictive system) to remain in a stable, low-stress state, F should approach zero. The higher the free energy, the greater the stress or uncertainty in the system. This idea directly connects to the concept of entropy, the natural tendency toward disorder which both we and our brains constantly try to resist.</li><li><strong><em>s</em></strong> — sensory input: everything we receive from the external world — sounds, tactile sensations, visual images, etc.</li><li><strong><em>m</em></strong> — internal model: our internal representation of how the world works. Essentially, our expectations about external reality or specific aspects of it.</li><li><strong><em>P</em></strong><em> </em>— probability: represents the likelihood of a certain sensory input given our internal model (it’s defined by what’s in the parentheses but not part of the main operation). The result ranges from 0 to 1, since it’s a probability.</li><li><strong>−ln</strong> — natural logarithm: this function converts probabilities (values between 0 and 1) into a scale from 0 to infinity, making the difference between expectation and reality mathematically measurable but not limited.</li></ul><p>The higher the probability, the smaller the resulting value. In other words, our brain is “happy” when the probability of our expectations matching what we actually perceive equals 1 (maximum probability) — in that case, F=0. The lower the probability (P), the greater the amount of free energy (F): 1 = 0; 0.5 = 0.69; 0.1 = 2.3; 0.01 = 4.6.</p><p>Let’s look at an example. A user moves the cursor over something that looks like a button: text on a bright blue rectangle.</p><figure><img alt=""Interface example of a button with active cursor"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*idKF4TdvSkphrORSln-aGg.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p>m — the user expects that the button will somehow change its state, what we usually call a hover state.</p><p>s — nothing happens to the button itself, but the cursor changes.</p><p>Technically, the user’s expectations were violated. But since our internal models are more complex than a single visual reaction, the additional input (the cursor change) helped complete the picture. When the button eventually responds to a click, the user almost immediately forgets the odd interaction.</p><p>Their P might have dropped slightly, perhaps to 0.95, meaning the probability that their mental model still matches the incoming input remains very high. The amount of free energy is close to zero. The brain is calm, the user is satisfied, the product is sold.</p><p>Now let’s take a negative example. The user moves the cursor over the same button: the same text, the same blue rectangle. The user once again expects that clicking it will initiate a purchase, that’s our m (the internal model).</p><p>But the response is nothing: no color change, no cursor change, not even an error message. The user clicks repeatedly. Their P (probability) that their mental model matches the actual input, drops close to zero.</p><figure><img alt=""Interface example of a button with no hover feedback."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SN8vFhrI6J4EoE0zb1jFCA.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p>The brain starts trying to reduce the growing amount of free energy, sending out emotional signals. In this case, the button, the site, the entire interaction become irritants. Almost unconsciously, the user begins performing a series of random actions, trying to fix the problem.</p><p>And if we’re lucky, they eventually scroll up and notice that the email field is outlined in red with a message saying it’s required. They enter the email, click Buy again, and finally succeed.</p><p>Not as happy, but at least with a product on the way. All of this happened simply because the button had no disabled state, no visual communication that it couldn’t yet be pressed, forcing the user to waste five tense seconds clicking into nothing.</p><p>This is a fairly simple example that directly illustrates the relationship between our expectations and our perception of reality. But there are many others that you, as designers, already know well.</p><p>Take the Gestalt principles, for instance. We don’t just see a random collection of shapes but we instinctively try to group them and assign meaning. It’s something our brain does automatically, without conscious effort. That’s exactly why, at the beginning of this section, I emphasized that this principle isn’t about us as individuals. It’s about our brain itself.</p><p>Our brain constantly relies on its internal model, comparing it with the incoming sensory input we receive. And when the amount of free energy becomes too high, the brain automatically tries to fix the problem.</p><p>It starts to create new categories or groups, sending the necessary emotional signals to push us toward resolving the discrepancy. Sometimes, it adjusts the internal model itself, modifying m in the formula to reduce the gap between expectation and reality. That’s actually how we learn something new and this, in fact, can explain the very nature of our neuroplasticity.</p><p>But the brain can also go the other way distorting perception, effectively altering s in the formula, the sensory input itself. And that’s where we enter the territory of cognitive biases and perceptual illusions, an entire field in itself, and one that truly deserves the attention of us designers.</p><h3>Abduction is the key to humanity</h3><p>I’m confident in saying that almost every well-known principle we are using in design can ultimately be explained through the Free Energy Principle. But that doesn’t mean we, as designers, need to consciously apply it in our daily work. Good and even excellent designers usually operate within the beginner and intermediate levels of design psychology, and that’s more than enough to create meaningful, functional products.</p><p>For me personally, it has always been and still is fascinating to understand why things, principles, and rules work the way they do. That’s why I try to find explanations and new perspectives through different sciences. And psychology is one of them.</p><p>With this article, I’d like to invite you to look at the familiar design dogmas we follow from a slightly different angle and to try broadening our perspective.</p><p>In a world where AI already knows all these rules and can even create interfaces based on them, what may soon remain truly ours is our human curiosity, the desire to reach for truth, to question what we take for granted, and to look at problems from new angles, expanding the boundaries of any given task.</p><p>In the language of philosophy, specifically the branch of logic we, as humans and users, most often rely on deduction and induction.</p><p>Deduction is deriving consequences from established rules. When we build our hypotheses based on principles and patterns. All clickable elements should change their state on hover → This button changes its state on hover → Therefore, this button is a clickable element.</p><p>Induction is generalizing from experience. When we conduct direct user testing. Our user clicked 100 different buttons, and each time the button changed its state on hover → The user now expects that all buttons should change their state when hovered over.</p><p>But we, as designers, are expected to bring new ideas into the world.</p><p>So I’d like to invite you to look at another type of reasoning — abduction. It is the process of forming a hypothesis that could best explain an observation.</p><figure><img alt=""Triangular diagram showing the relation between abduction, deduction and induction with text descriptions."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/850/1*cLJYu98iQ0ogbr6iNisEuw.png"" /><figcaption>The relation between abduction, deduction and induction. <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Fig-A1-The-relation-between-abduction-deduction-and-induction-Several-alternative_fig1_48326326"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>We notice that users often close the payment page without clicking the button → What if the problem isn’t the button’s state but the emotional context — the anxiety or distrust triggered by the act of payment? → Let’s change “Pay” to “Secure Payment” and add the logos of trusted payment providers below the button to increase confidence.</p><blockquote>Abduction is the process of forming explanatory hypotheses. It is the only logical operation which introduces any new idea.<br /><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce""><em>Charles S. Peirce</em></a><em> in </em><a href=""https://isidore.co/misc/Res%20pro%20Deo/Peirce/Done/5.html""><em>Collected Papers, CP 5.172</em></a></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Portrait of philosopher Charles S. Peirce, associated with the concept of abduction."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*7FcbdkzlQAL20VNs.png"" /><figcaption>Charles Sanders Peirce. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce#/media/File:Charles_Sanders_Peirce.png"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>You could even say that by using abduction, we ourselves become prediction machines: the feeling of anticipation, building a hypothesis, is what has made us human for thousands of years. It’s how we were able to achieve such heights of science and technology out of nothing.</p><p>And this ability appeared in us precisely because our brain tries to get rid of free energy. That’s why I believe this principle is important not only to try to explain user behavior, but it is fundamental for us, as creators, thinkers, and engineers.</p><h3>Final thoughts</h3><p>And as for the practical application of today’s topic, I suggest you the following approach as an experiment just for yourself: if you’re facing a tough problem or one you’ve solved a hundred times, try ignoring all design principles for a moment. Approach it as if you only had abduction to generate hypotheses and the Free Energy Principle to evaluate them.</p><p>Take a specific user and the situation they’re in, then sketch several alternative solutions you can score with the formula F = −ln P(s∣m).</p><p>Fill in the variables: m (what the user expected) and s (what the user actually saw). Then estimate which solution “minimizes free energy”, meaning yields the highest probability that perception will match expectation. And that’s your leading candidate.</p><p>And remember, psychology gives us the lens, design provides the tools, but the final verdict always belongs to the human being whose subjective perception can overturn any formula. That’s why theory is only valuable as long as it remains flexible, ready to yield to real observation, to the living unpredictable experience of the people we design for.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=0e557d122b81"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/lower-the-surprise-applying-the-free-energy-principle-to-ux-0e557d122b81"">Lower the surprise: Applying The free energy principle to UX</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I’m talking about <strong>architecting the “how”</strong> — the flow of cognitive work between human and AI. Who does what? Where does intelligence live? How do they collaborate? This is the discipline of designing intelligent systems, not just intelligent features.</p><p>Let me show you exactly how Perplexity and NotebookLM do it — and what you can apply to your own products.</p><h3>The architecture difference</h3><p>Here’s what people miss:</p><p>Both products run on the same foundation — large language models, vector embeddings, search APIs, retrieval-augmented generation.</p><p><strong>Same ingredients.

Because they architected different <strong>intelligence flows</strong> — different answers to these critical questions:</p><ul><li>WHERE does AI work autonomously?</li><li>WHERE does human provide direction?</li><li>HOW do they hand off work between them?</li><li>WHAT intelligence lives in which layer?</li></ul><blockquote><strong><em>In his </em></strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ""><strong><em>June 2025 keynote at Y Combinator</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Andrej Karpathy — former director of AI at Tesla and OpenAI co-founder — described this exact shift:</em></strong><em> </em>“LLMs aren’t just tools anymore.

Intelligence Flow Architecture = intelligence embedded in the system’s core.)</p><h4><strong>The four principles</strong></h4><h3>Principle 1: Design backward from autonomous execution</h3><p>Don’t start with: <em>“What interface should we show?”</em></p><p>Start with: <em>“What will the system DO autonomously?”</em></p><ul><li>Perplexity: Search + synthesize + cite</li><li>NotebookLM: Analyze + map + generate formats</li></ul><p>Then design everything else to enable that autonomy.</p><p>This inverts traditional software design. Traditional products started with the interface — buttons, menus, workflows — then built backend systems to support them. Intelligence-first architecture starts with autonomous execution and works backward.</p><blockquote><em>The shift is profound: from </em>“How will users accomplish this task?” to “What can the system accomplish autonomously?” <em>As </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_RjOhCkhvQ""><em>Satya Nadella</em></a><em> noted, we’re moving business logic from the application tier to the intelligence tier. The execution layer defines your system’s value — everything else exists to enable it.</em></blockquote><p>Without this inversion, you end up with “AI features” bolted onto traditional interfaces. The intelligence feels like an add-on because it IS an add-on. True intelligence-first architecture means intelligence is embedded as fundamental structure, not added as features.</p><h3>Principle 2: Embed intelligence in specific layers</h3><p>Don’t bolt AI on as features.</p><p>Architect where intelligence lives:</p><ul><li>Perplexity: Intelligence in synthesis layer</li><li>NotebookLM: Intelligence in knowledge processing layer</li></ul><p>The intelligence isn’t visible as “AI feature” — it’s structural.</p><p>The test for embedded intelligence: Can you remove the AI and still have a functional product? If yes, intelligence is bolted on. If no, it’s embedded.</p><p>Perplexity without its synthesis intelligence doesn’t exist — it’s not “Google with AI added,” it’s a fundamentally different architecture where intelligence IS the product. NotebookLM’s knowledge processing layer isn’t a feature you can toggle off; it’s the system’s foundation.</p><p>This architectural embedding happens in specific layers of your five-layer stack. Intelligence doesn’t float everywhere — it concentrates where transformation occurs. In Perplexity, that’s Layer 2 (synthesis orchestration). In NotebookLM, it’s Layer 2 (knowledge graph construction). Identify where YOUR system’s intelligence must live, then build everything to support that layer.</p><h3>Principle 3: Design clear human/AI boundaries</h3><p>Define precisely where AI works autonomously and where human provides direction:</p><ul><li>Perplexity: Human directs → AI discovers → Human evaluates</li><li>NotebookLM: Human curates → AI orchestrates → Human explores</li></ul><blockquote><strong><em>Think of this as creating control maps — the new journey maps for AI experiences.</em></strong><em> Instead of mapping what users do, you map who is in control (user, AI, or both) and when that control shifts. As </em><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/from-journey-maps-to-control-maps-17aac58b9dd9""><em>Rob Chappell</em></a><em> notes, </em>“The question is no longer ‘What is the user trying to do?’ The more relevant question is: ‘Who is in control at this moment, and how does that shift?’”</blockquote><p>This is the evolution from traditional user journeys to human-AI collaboration flows.</p><p><strong>This pattern is becoming so clear that in June 2025, Karpathy dedicated his Y Combinator keynote to it.</strong> He calls it “partial autonomy” — systems where AI generates and humans verify in a continuous loop.</p><p>The architectural insight: <strong>The fastest generation-verification loop wins. Not the most autonomous AI.</strong></p><p>That’s why <a href=""https://cursor.com/"">Cursor</a> (coding), Perplexity (search), and NotebookLM (research) are succeeding — they optimized the loop, not the autonomy.</p><h3>Principle 4: Optimize for cognitive distribution</h3><p>Not: “Can AI do this task?”</p><p>But: “SHOULD AI do this, or SHOULD human?”</p><ul><li><strong>Human strengths:</strong> Goal definition, judgment, creative direction, evaluation</li><li><strong>AI strengths:</strong> Discovery, synthesis, pattern recognition, execution</li></ul><p>Both products make this mapping explicit in their architecture.</p><p>This requires mapping cognitive strengths systematically. From your Hybrid Cognition Map: Humans excel at goal definition, context understanding, judgment calls, ambiguity resolution, ethical decisions, creative direction, and stakeholder intuition. AI excels at information retrieval, pattern recognition, rapid iteration, consistency, tedious execution, multi-source synthesis, and 24/7 availability.</p><p>The magic happens at the intersection — not human OR AI, but human AND AI working in complementary strengths. Perplexity distributes: human defines information need (judgment), AI discovers and synthesizes (execution). NotebookLM distributes: human curates sources (context), AI processes and orchestrates (synthesis).</p><p>Poor cognitive distribution creates friction. If you ask humans to do what AI does better (tedious data processing), or ask AI to do what humans do better (strategic judgment), the collaboration fails. Design explicitly for strengths, not just capabilities.</p><figure><img alt=""The complete framework: Four principles that define how Perplexity and NotebookLM architect human-AI collaboration.

I took photos of the worksheet, showed them to an AI, and asked it to generate similar exercises. Seconds later: a new practice set, perfectly matched to her level.</p><p>She finished it. Asked for another. I already had everything loaded — another set appeared in seconds.</p><p><strong>This wasn’t impressive because the AI was smart.</strong> It was impressive because I’d designed the <strong>how</strong>: Photo → Parse → Generate → Verify → Iterate. A five-second intelligence flow that would have taken me 30 minutes manually.</p><p>That’s Intelligence Flow Architecture in daily life.</p><p>Now let’s make it actionable for your team.</p><h3>From analysis to application</h3><p>You’ve seen how Perplexity and NotebookLM architect intelligence flows.</p><p>Now let’s make this actionable for your team.</p><p>The method works for any product workflow — from email to CRM to document editing.</p><p>Here’s the four-step process:</p><h3>How to apply intelligence flow architecture to your product</h3><h4><strong>STEP 1: Map your current workflow</strong></h4><p>Pick one core workflow. List every step users do manually.</p><h4><strong>STEP 2: Identify cognitive work</strong></h4><p>For each step, ask:</p><ul><li>Is this discovery work? (AI strength)</li><li>Is this synthesis? (AI strength)</li><li>Is this judgment? (Human strength)</li><li>Is this goal-setting? (Human strength)</li></ul><h4><strong>STEP 3: Design the intelligence flow</strong></h4><p>Redistribute work:</p><ul><li>What should AI do autonomously?</li><li>Where does human direct?</li><li>What are the handoff points?</li></ul><h4><strong>STEP 4: Design backward from execution</strong></h4><ul><li>What will AI execute? (execution layer)</li><li>What intelligence enables that? (intelligence layer)</li><li>How do systems coordinate? (orchestration layer)</li><li>How does human express intention? (input layer)</li></ul><h4><strong>Example: Redesigning email with Intelligence Flow Architecture</strong></h4><p>Let’s make this concrete. Here’s how Intelligence Flow Architecture transforms a common workflow — email composition.</p><p>Traditional Gmail requires you to manually type, edit, format, and send — roughly 5 minutes of writing every word. Intelligence Flow Architecture redesigns this as a 6-layer collaboration where AI handles autonomous execution while you provide direction and judgment.</p><p>The result: 30 seconds instead of 5 minutes. Directing instead of writing.</p><figure><img alt=""Email workflow transformation: Traditional Gmail requires 5 minutes of manual writing.

The Tesla lesson</h3><p>Before we dive into what this means for product teams, let’s address the obvious question: <strong>Why design for partial autonomy instead of full autonomous agents?</strong></p><p>In his June 2025 keynote, Karpathy shared a telling story from his five years building autonomous systems at Tesla:</p><p>In 2013, he took a perfect self-driving ride in a Waymo — zero interventions, flawless. He thought: “Self-driving is imminent.”</p><p><strong>That was 12 years ago.</strong> Even now, <a href=""https://waymo.com/"">Waymo vehicles</a> that appear driverless still require significant human teleoperation and oversight.</p><blockquote><strong><em>His warning applies directly to product design:</em></strong><em> When AI generates massive outputs — 10,000 lines of code, complete research reports, fully redesigned interfaces — you haven’t saved time if verification takes hours. </em>“When I see things like ‘oh 2025 is the year of agents,’ I get very concerned. This is the <strong>decade</strong> of agents.”</blockquote><blockquote><strong>“We have to keep the AI on the leash,”</strong> <em>Karpathy emphasized. Not because AI isn’t capable, but because </em><strong><em>verification speed determines actual productivity.</em></strong></blockquote><p>This is why Intelligence Flow Architecture prioritizes the generation-verification loop over full autonomy. The goal isn’t to remove humans from the loop. <strong>The goal is to make the loop spin as fast as possible.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Karpathy’s lesson from 12 years at Tesla: Fast generation-verification loops beat pursuing full autonomy. Loop speed determines productivity, not autonomy level."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2OemyGgIYm1AjKuiQUmbuQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Karpathy’s lesson from 12 years at Tesla: Fast generation-verification </em>loops beat pursuing full autonomy. Loop speed determines productivity, <em>not autonomy level. </em>Visualization created with Gemini AI.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>A note for designers:</strong> You might be thinking “I’m not a system architect. Can I actually apply this?” Yes. Intelligence Flow Architecture isn’t about backend engineering — it’s about design thinking applied to human-AI collaboration. Start small: Pick one workflow. Map where human directs vs where AI executes. That’s architecting intelligence flows. You’re already doing this thinking — now you have language for it.</p><h3>What this means for product teams</h3><p>Here’s what changes when you adopt Intelligence Flow Architecture:</p><h4><strong>BEFORE (AI Features):</strong></h4><ul><li>PM says: “Let’s add AI to this workflow”</li><li>Designer asks: “What should the AI button look like?”</li><li>Engineer builds: API call to GPT → show response</li><li>Result: Feature that feels bolted on</li></ul><h4><strong>AFTER (Intelligence Flow Architecture):</strong></h4><ul><li>PM asks: “What cognitive work should AI handle autonomously?”</li><li>Designer maps: Human direction → AI execution → Human evaluation</li><li>Engineer architects: Intelligence layer + orchestration layer + execution layer</li><li>Result: System that feels intelligent</li></ul><h3><strong>The pattern</strong></h3><p>Perplexity and NotebookLM didn’t ask “How do we add AI?”</p><p>They asked: “How do we architect collaboration between human and artificial intelligence?”</p><p>That’s the difference between an AI feature and an intelligent system.</p><p>That’s Intelligence Flow Architecture.</p><p>And that framework — deciding where intelligence lives, how work distributes, when systems execute autonomously — <strong>that’s intelligence-first architecture.</strong></p><p><strong>Same AI models.</strong><br /><strong>Different architecture.</strong><br /><strong>Completely different experience.</strong></p><p>Now you know why.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ace59eeda531"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/perplexity-and-notebooklm-dont-use-better-ai-they-use-better-intelligence-flow-architecture-ace59eeda531"">Perplexity and NotebookLM don’t use better AI—they use better intelligence flow architecture</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Emerging personality patterns that drive differentiation in AI products</h4><figure><img alt=""Cover image depicting different AI products like Slack bot, Claude, Tolans and Moxie robot."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*r5Fda8lcau0bg7QYOs1FHw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>In 1966, MIT’s Joseph Weizenbaum created ELIZA, a conversational AI that mimicked a Rogerian therapist using simple pattern matching. Despite its limited design, many users felt understood and emotionally “seen,” attributing empathy and intent to the system, a phenomenon later called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect""><strong>“ELIZA effect</strong></a><strong>”. </strong>From the very start, people related to even basic conversational software as if it had a mind of its own.</p><p>Long before modern AI, product and brand design had already embraced personality as a differentiator. <a href=""https://imgs.search.brave.com/bGxPgSeNEiF9Eug7c4YNn_bgulI2vwDeCDJqyq_KKtU/rs:fit:860:0:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9kMmlq/ejZvNXhheTF4cS5j/bG91ZGZyb250Lm5l/dC9hY2NvdW50XzQ4/MS9TY3JlZW5zaG90/MjAxOC0xMS0wOGF0/MTFfMDRfMThBTV81/NDI1N2M0MTI4M2Mx/NWI0YTMxNTRiNjMz/ZDRlY2IxNV84MDAu/cG5n"">Mailchimp’s playful feedback</a> or <a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/slack-copywriting-what-they-say-to-9-6-million-pageviews-every-month-4351888f1c2c"">Slack’s quirky copywriting</a> showed how tone and character could give otherwise functional software a distinctive emotional presence. Design theory reinforces this! <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_Design""><strong>Norman’s emotional design theory</strong></a> shows that products which evoke emotion foster attachment and loyalty<strong>,</strong> while <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism""><strong>anthropomorphism</strong></a><strong> </strong>explains our instinct to assign human traits to machines.<strong> </strong>Sherry Turkle’s research at MIT shows that people form <a href=""https://sts-program.mit.edu/book/alone-together-expect-technology-less-eachother/""><strong>“artificial intimacy”</strong></a> with conversational agents assigning them emotions, motives, and moral qualities as if they were caring entities rather than tools.</p><p>In modern AI systems, this projection becomes even more consequential. Anthropic, for example, shapes <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyJj9RxSsBY""><strong>Claude</strong> around a deliberate character</a> — thoughtful, principled, and balanced — by embedding values and ethical reasoning into how the model thinks and responds.</p><p>Thus<strong>, designing for personality shifts from a branding layer to a core interaction layer </strong>that shapes trust, adoption, and long-term habits.</p><h3>Emerging personality patterns in AI products</h3><p>This framework draws from my work on a virtual pet at <a href=""https://www.ideo.com/"">IDEO</a>, a companion robot at <a href=""https://miko.ai/"">Miko.ai</a>, and most recently an AI tutor at <a href=""https://www.getsupernova.ai/new-home"">SuperNova AI </a>— supported by research (reference list in the end) across HCI, HRI, and narrative design .</p><p>Personality in AI systems is shaped much like a human character with underlying internal traits that drive behavior and external expressive cues that make those traits visible.</p><ul><li><strong>Internal layer</strong> refers to the traits and personality cues like values, worldview, personality archetype, backstory and contextual intelligence.</li><li><strong>External layer</strong> expresses these traits through the surface with avatar, typography, tone of voice, motion, and other multi-modal feedback cues.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""A diagram showing an AI personality model with Internal Layer components on the left and External Layer components on the right, all pointing to a central AI icon.

Purpose, worldview and values</h3><h4><strong>Purpose</strong></h4><p>Purpose is the starting point and shapes the AI’s <em>relationship</em> to the user based on what it helps them accomplish. <br /><br />An AI built to <em>teach</em> will naturally behave differently from one designed to <em>co-create an app or automate commands</em>. <strong>Defining purpose guides —</strong></p><ul><li><em>What is this AI supposed to accomplish for users?</em></li><li><em>What should be the nature of AI-human relation? Is the interaction like interacting with a tool help, a pet/ companion or a collaborator/ supervisor/ assistant?</em></li></ul><p>After purpose, worldview and values form the underlying belief system that makes the AI’s behavior consistent and predictable across different situations.</p><h4><strong>Worldview</strong></h4><p>Defines <em>how the AI interprets problems and reasons under uncertainty, </em>whether it approaches tasks with caution, optimism, curiosity, or analytical detachment. <strong>Defining worldview guides —</strong></p><ul><li><em>How should user needs/ problems be approached?</em></li><li><em>What matters most in its interactions?</em></li></ul><h4><strong>Values</strong></h4><p>Define the AI’s ethical boundaries and priorities — the principles it won’t break. They influence not only <em>what</em> the AI refuses, but <em>how</em> it refuses, shaping the emotional tone of guardrails. <strong>Defining values guides —</strong></p><ul><li>What are the rules it shouldn’t break?</li><li>How should it protect or guide the user?</li></ul><figure><img alt=""A split-screen image explaining Purpose, Worldview, and Values using Claude’s system prompt.

Archetypes</h3><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype#:~:text=An%20archetype%20can%20be%20any,,%20or%20%22merge%22%20into.""><strong>Brand archetypes</strong></a> are universal character prototypes drawn from Carl Jung’s psychology. Brands adopt these familiar personas to evoke specific emotions and embody core values.</p><p>Selecting an archetype helps determine whether your AI feels like a playful entertainer (Jester), a wise advisor (Sage), an empathetic supporter (Caregiver) or any of the other twelve classic archetypes.</p><figure><img alt=""A brand-archetype wheel showing twelve archetypes (Creator, Innocent, Sage, Explorer, Outlaw, Magician, Hero, Lover, Jester, Everyman, Caregiver, Ruler).

Its warm, calm visual identity and starburst icon signal structure and trust, while its communication style stays gentle, honest, and reflective.</li><li><strong>Wysa (Jester + Coach)</strong> a compassionate, judgment-free companion focused on emotional support and guided healing. Its cute penguin mascot and playful tone signal approachability and warmth, while its communication style stays empathetic, encouraging, and grounded in evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy.</li></ul><p>Archetypes resonate at a subconscious level guiding the design to maintain character consistency and thus strengthening user experience and engagement.</p><h3>3. Backstory</h3><p>In consumer-facing AI, where emotional connection is key, backstory adds coherence and emotional weight to the interaction. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet_on_the_Holodeck"">Janet Murray’s Hamlet on the Holodeck</a> shows that when virtual characters have defined roles and histories, it enriches user interaction and making the system feel more alive and intentional.</p><figure><img alt=""An image of the Miko robot on the left and a chat transcript on the right, where Miko answers questions about its name, age, abilities, and identity with playful personality. A caption explains that Miko robots have rich backstories users uncover through conversation."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MXwMEzP9HuRskUPhuce0Bw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Some successful consumer products which follow this pattern strongly are</p><ul><li><a href=""http://www.miko.ai""><strong>Miko</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The companion robot invites children to ask, <em>“Where did you come from?”, “What’s your job?”, “Are you a boy or a girl?”</em> — revealing his backstory and personality through playful dialogue.</li><li><a href=""https://www.tolans.com/""><strong>Tolan</strong></a><strong>:</strong> General-purpose assistants take on the persona of friendly aliens from planet Portolah, each arriving with distinct personalities and quirks to befriend their human companions</li><li><a href=""https://character.ai/""><strong>Character.ai</strong></a><strong>:</strong> A massive platform where users chat with millions of AI characters, each with detailed backstories, personalities and fictional histories to explore.</li></ul><h3>4. Context adaptation</h3><p>Contextual adaptation is the AI’s ability to respond appropriately to a user’s <strong>situational context or emotional state</strong> and shaping tone, language, and pacing to feel human and supportive.</p><p>This relies on techniques like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_recognition""><strong>emotional state recognition</strong></a> (detecting sentiment or tone), <a href=""https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/ai-mirroring-behaviors""><strong>conversational mirroring</strong></a> (reflecting the user’s phrasing or energy), and <strong>contextual personality shifting</strong> (adjusting tone or style based on task complexity or user mood) .</p><ul><li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa""><strong>Alexa</strong></a>, though simpler, varies its vocal delivery: sounding excited when offering good news (“It’s sunny all day!”) or disappointed when reporting a loss, reinforcing its role as a helpful household companion.</li><li><a href=""https://answeringagent.com/blog/5-ways-ai-adapts-tone-for-customer-calls""><strong>T-Mobile’s AI</strong> reduced customer complaints by 73%</a> through instant detection of negative sentiment and tone mirroring</li><li><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.replika.app&amp;hl=en_IN&amp;pli=1""><strong>Replika</strong></a>, performs deep, long-term mirroring. It learns a user’s vocabulary, emotional patterns, and interaction style over many conversations, gradually shaping its own language, tone, and even “personality” to reflect the individual.</li></ul><h3>5. Visual identity</h3><p>Visual identity is often the first layer through which users infer an AI product’s personality. Design decisions around logo, avatar, color, type and even hardware shapes cues.</p><figure><img alt=""Image showing Perplexity’s geometric logo, Claude’s serif typography, and the Lovot robot. A caption notes that Claude’s serifs feel warm and credible, Perplexity’s sans-serif feels modern and analytical, and Lovot’s soft design conveys a companion-like personality."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sQ7i9Nt3p9T041kdfEAYoQ.jpeg"" /></figure><ul><li><strong>Logo/ Avatar/ Embodied identity </strong>give an AI a recognizable “face” and act as an immediate proxy for personality. For instance, <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/"">Perplexity</a>’s logo, is minimal, geometric, and abstract and it subtly animates during search to cue users that AI is creating an answer. On the other end of the spectrum, more expressive AI products like <a href=""https://lovot.life/en/"">Lovot</a> uses a physical body, large eyes, soft materials, and even personalised clothing to project warmth, affection, and a companion-like presence.</li><li><strong>Typography</strong> contributes to brand voice in chat interfaces. For example, <strong>Claude’s serif typography conveys</strong> warmth, maturity, and approachability — qualities that align with its thoughtful, privacy-first positioning. <strong>Perplexity’s geometric sans-serif communicates</strong> modern technical clarity and reliability, reinforcing its role as a precise, research-oriented tool.</li><li><strong>Illustrations/ Imagery:</strong> Supports communicating information in a delightful way</li><li><strong>Motion and Animation: </strong>Motion guidelines define how elements animate, transition, and respond to user interaction.</li><li><strong>Color palette</strong> reinforce AI personality archetypes by leveraging emotional associations rooted in color psychology. For example. blue signals trust and calm (Alexa), bright green colours signal playfulness and growth (Duolingo, Miko) and muted tones as professionalism (Notion AI).</li></ul><h3>6. Communication style &amp; copy</h3><p>Communication style and copy are also the most visible expressions of an AI’s personality. Whether experienced through <strong>voice or text,</strong> elements like <strong>tone</strong>, <strong>phrasing</strong>, <strong>pacing</strong>, <strong>formality </strong>work together to communicate character’s personality and guide user experience.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Duolingo’s writing guidelines page showing the section on ‘Voice’. It describes how Duolingo’s brand personality appears through words, supported by four voice qualities — expressive, playful, embracing and worldly — with a sidebar menu on the left and an illustration on top"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZOGg6drhwqpcvegAtbKosw.jpeg"" /></figure><h4>Core elements shared across voice and chat interfaces</h4><ul><li><strong>Tone</strong> sets the emotional posture: formal tones (e.g., <em>Sage</em>, <em>Ruler</em>) project authority and professionalism, while informal tones (e.g., <em>Everyman</em>, <em>Jester</em>) build warmth and approachability. For example, <a href=""https://www.capitalone.com/digital/tools/eno/"">Capital One’s Eno</a> uses “First things first” is perceived as friendlier than “Here is the first step” in user research.</li><li><strong>Phrasing and vocabulary</strong> reflect personality cues. For instance, a Caregiver might say “<em>“Let me walk you through this , we’ll figure it out together,”</em>,” while Sage personas might use precise, technical terms (e.g., “<em>“Let me explain the details step by step</em>”).</li><li><strong>Pacing and prosody</strong> (in voice), or <strong>structure and grammar</strong> (in text), shape rhythm and emphasis which is key to emotional delivery and comprehension. Models from <a href=""https://elevenlabs.io/docs/models"">ElevanLabs V3</a> and <a href=""https://cartesia.ai/sonic"">Cartesia</a> uses intentional pauses and inflection to simulate human-like and expressive speech generation.</li></ul><h4>Modality differences: Voice vs. Chat</h4><p>Voice-first interfaces (e.g., Alexa, Miko) rely heavily on <strong>prosody, timing, and conversational repair</strong>. Spoken interactions are adaptive — users naturally adjust tone, pacing, or emphasis when there’s confusion.</p><p>In contrast, chat-based interfaces (e.g., Claude, Perplexity) emphasize <strong>structural clarity, grammar, and concise phrasing</strong>.

Multimodal feedback</h3><p><strong>Multimodal feedback</strong> refers to the way an AI system expresses its internal states such as listening, thinking, processing, or responding sometime called <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/chain-of-thoughts""><strong>Chain-of-thought (CoT)</strong></a><strong> display </strong>through various visual design elements and multiple sensory channels. These channels can include <strong>visual cues</strong>, <strong>voice and sound design</strong>, <strong>micro-animations</strong>, <strong>LED lights</strong>, or <strong>haptics</strong>.</p><p><strong>It allows users to <em>see</em>, <em>hear</em> or <em>feel</em> what the AI is doing</strong>, making the interaction more interpretable, human-like and trustworthy.</p><figure><img alt=""Four examples of AI systems showing how they express internal state: Replit panels with micro-animations for thinking steps; Alexa device with LED ring phases — idle, listening, thinking, speaking; Duolingo voice call using animated character face; Moxie robot using voice, eyes, and body movement"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2C-JnFqBHXrmlqKoxgfg-g.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Multimodal feedback varies across products depending on how much personality is intended for the product.</p><ul><li><a href=""https://replit.com/ai"">Replit AI</a>, <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/"">Perplexity</a>, <a href=""https://claude.ai/"">Claude</a><strong> </strong>relies on <strong>icon animations</strong> and <strong>microcopy</strong> to communicates system states.</li><li>Alexa devices like <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B8V1LZ3?ref=amzdv_ucc_dp_lod__B09B8V1LZ3&amp;th=1"">Echo dot</a> uses <strong>LED lights</strong>, <strong>voice tone</strong> and <strong>sound effects</strong> to express internal states.

Research in human–robot interaction (Michalowski et al., 2007; Hoffman &amp; Breazeal, 2007; Breazeal, 2003) shows when robots align their timing with humans — pausing at the right moments, matching conversational pacing, or synchronizing gesture and gaze —<strong> interactions feel more alive</strong>, more engaging<strong>, more lifelike, and more trustworthy</strong>.</p><p>Products like <strong>Tolans</strong> use coordinated animations, eye-gaze, and motion timing to signal attention and emotional states, making the characters feel alive. Voice agents like <strong>Alexa</strong> similarly use rhythmic cues — brief pauses, LED pulses, and vocal pacing — to create a sense of responsiveness. In both cases, achieving the right timing transforms abstract AI behaviour into something that feels intentional, expressive, and socially fluent.</p><h3>When does personality matter?</h3><p>The fundamental question to ask before designing for personality, if your product needs one and how complex?</p><p>Not every AI system needs a quirky mascot or empathetic voice.

They want to build a product which they are super sure of; they have their pitch deck ready, investors are lined up, and they want to hit market in six months. All they need is a working product: an embodiment of their mission. As a product manager, you do the usual. In a short duration, you conjure up enough details to come up with a roadmap. A plan with all the required features to put the product in the hands of potential users. It is well-detailed, with release dates and launch timelines. You align the team and start development. <strong>What could go wrong?</strong></blockquote><p>Working constantly with early-stage startups has taught me one thing: startups are a minefield of uncertainty. If a founder believes they have all their answers on <strong>day one, </strong>they pretty much have a dream to sell you. It might just say that on the pitch deck.</p><p>In my experience, anything a startup builds in its early stages is a whole lot of assumptions wrapped around a concrete vision. When you start treating these assumptions as ground reality and planning features rather than outcomes, you create a recipe for trouble. A well-documented, timeline-based feature roadmap is often where the problem starts.</p><p>These plans actually give founder and teams a false sense of security. However, teams very quickly realise that:</p><p><strong>Feature roadmaps limit exploration and discovery. </strong>If the boundaries of exploration are limited to a predefined feature set, you quickly find yourself boxed in. Instead of giving the team ample time to actually solve problems, you end up preparing for the next release cycle as the team focuses on building the current feature on the list.</p><p><strong>Feature roadmaps leave little room for new information.</strong> These plans operate under the conviction that all underlying assumptions have been fully priced in, locking potential ideas, features, and deadlines in advance.</p><p>However, as you start working on the product, the <strong><em>act of building</em></strong> itself brings significant clarity. New information either challenges or validates previously made assumptions. As a result, you are compelled to carve out a new shape for the product — one that reflects an evolved understanding, sometimes with a focus on revised outcomes.</p><p>This is where feature roadmaps fail to adapt. They are built for predictability, and any change often leads to delays or scope expansion. You then have to resist new ideas and information just to stay on track with previously set timelines.</p><p><strong>Feature roadmaps have a confidence bias. </strong>They inherently believe that the solution, from the outset, is already fit for the market in its current shape. What is supposed to be a strategic and continuous discovery turns into a scheduling exercise. In reality, just because you are solving the right problem doesn’t mean the current shape of the product will perform well in the market.</p><p><strong>Feature roadmaps underestimate the invisible work.</strong> Development teams often require a fair amount of time and effort to figure out the <em>right</em> way to build before dipping their hands into execution. This is difficult to plan for, as the paths of discovery are not always linear. Sometimes you have to spend more time delivering the same planned item. The timeline is affected not by new demands, but by a well-defined scope.</p><blockquote><em>A PM I know used to say ‘</em><strong><em>Roadmaps are the glue that makes strategy stick to planning’. </em></strong><em>Lately, I feel the longer they are planned for, the </em><strong><em>harder</em></strong><em> they set in, making things very difficult and </em><strong><em>costly</em></strong><em> to pull away.</em></blockquote><p>Don’t get me wrong. I am not saying they are a bad exercise. Early-stage startups <strong>need</strong> to have a vision and a pathway to get there, and roadmaps serve that purpose effectively. What I do take issue with is the way of thinking that propagates building ‘all the things we thought were correct <strong>then</strong>’ at the cost of ‘what we know <strong>now’,</strong> treating previous ideas as gospel truth. A product being built just for the sake of it. It’s a lose-lose situation for everyone.</p><p>So, what’s the alternative?</p><ol><li><strong>Building roadmaps around outcomes, not features. </strong>This gives your team the agility to adapt to one of the umpteen pathways that could be used to arrive at the desired outcome. Outcome-focused roadmaps also ensure that the team focuses on solving the problem at hand and not just checking stories off a to-do list.</li><li><strong>Make clarity your top priority. </strong>Be it through initial research, alpha releases, or targeted experiments, your first three months should focus on validating your assumptions. These will help you plan a more robust roadmap, rather than building a product on ideas made of sand.</li><li><strong>Use the 666 method. </strong>A way of mapping horizons based on what your startup needs to focus on over the next <strong>6 years, 6 months, and 6 weeks</strong>.</li></ol><ul><li><strong>Next 6 years. </strong>This is your north star, the team’s vision of the future six years from now. This will change and evolve as your team learns how your product is built, adopted, and integrated into your users’ lives. Please do not create a fixed plan for six years.</li><li><strong>Next 6 months. </strong>This is your pathway of putting the product in front of your users for the very first time. It is a culmination of all your current beliefs, learnings and insights. The team should assume that only 50–60% of this plan will actually get built. The rest will emerge based on what you discover along the way, creating a need to revisit and revise this plan every couple of months.</li><li><strong>Next 6 weeks. </strong>This is where a feature roadmap makes sense. Once your team is confident on what needs to be built next, create a small, focused plan. Once locked in, changes here should be minimal. Make sure you know what you want to learn from the outcome of these six weeks. <strong>This is the only horizon where going granular is appropriate.</strong></li></ul><p><em>Lastly, learn to </em><strong><em>balance</em></strong><em> and </em><strong><em>realign</em></strong><em>. Planning works best when delivery and discovery are mapped together, each informing and correcting the other.</em></p><p>References:</p><ul><li>Yojji: Roadmap Startup Guide &amp; Examples: <a href=""https://yojji.io/blog/roadmap-startup-guide-examples"">https://yojji.io/blog/roadmap-startup-guide-examples</a></li><li>Clarify: The Art of Product Roadmapping for Early-Stage SaaS Founders: <a href=""https://www.clarify.ai/blog/the-art-of-product-roadmapping-for-early-stage-saas-founders"">https://www.clarify.ai/blog/the-art-of-product-roadmapping-for-early-stage-saas-founders</a></li><li>Product School: Now–Next–Later Roadmap Framework: <a href=""https://productschool.com/blog/product-strategy/now-next-later-roadmap"">https://productschool.com/blog/product-strategy/now-next-later-roadmap</a></li><li>Product plan: Product roadmaps for startups vs enterprises: <a href=""https://www.productplan.com/learn/product-roadmaps-startups-versus-enterprises/"">https://www.productplan.com/learn/product-roadmaps-startups-versus-enterprises/</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9360d392758b"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/why-feature-roadmaps-dont-work-for-early-stage-startups-9360d392758b"">Why feature roadmaps don’t work for early-stage startups</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

They scale a product people don’t love, solve problems users don’t have, and burn resources on ineffective experiments.</p><p>Let’s take a look at Workday, it’s a powerful HR and finance platform often criticized for its frustrating user experience, especially in the job application process. You guys, who’s ever tried Workday? We might know this isn’t an isolated issue. The Baymard Institute found that nearly 70% of online shopping carts are abandoned, largely due to poor UX.</p><p>This is the exact problem Product-Led Growth (PLG) aims to solve. In simple terms, PLG means your product itself becomes the primary engine for user acquisition, conversion, and retention. It’s a philosophy that forces design, marketing, sales, and engineering to align around the user experience. Often, this activity proceeds by a growth team who orchestrates but the skeleton is strategy + user experience.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6tb4w2wxyLCitsGdRh_0Dw.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://share.google/7WzjN5Ur51rKjUsEm""><em>The Product-Led Prism</em></a><em> by </em>www.productled.org</figcaption></figure><p>But there’s a catch.</p><h4><strong>The Foundation: Product-Market Fit</strong></h4><p>A business can only focus on true, scalable growth after achieving product-market fit. Without it, growth activities just scatter your efforts instead of driving focus, and accelerate failure.</p><p>So, how can you tell if your business has reached product–market fit?</p><p>It certainly shows up in terms of happier customers, lower churn rates, shortened sales cycles, and rapid organic growth. But the threshold for any of these can be tough to define.</p><p>For Pre-Product</p><ul><li>Visible excitement: “…we were getting literal love letters”</li><li>Someone’s pupils dilate when they use your stuff</li><li>People are wiling to pay for it now</li></ul><p>For Post-Product</p><ul><li>Retention: Users stick around.

Scaling beforehand is like building a skyscraper on sand.</p><h4><strong>The Pitfall: Confusing Speed with Strength</strong></h4><p>The pressure to grow fast, especially in early-stage startups, can be deafening. But speed without direction leads to failure.</p><p>An experienced business strategist, Yulia Neicovcean, illustrates two scenarios:</p><blockquote>“…</blockquote><blockquote>Scenario 1: Growth That Lasts</blockquote><blockquote>Companies decided early to build structure solid CRM, client retention strategies, and a focus on prime communities. They didn’t try to do everything. They specialized. As the market shifted, their brand held strong, and they kept growing steadily instead of burning out.</blockquote><blockquote>Scenario 2: Failure in Fast-Forward</blockquote><blockquote>Another company scaled aggressively hiring quickly, chasing every new trend, ignoring compliance and fundamentals. For a year it looked like they were unstoppable. But when regulations tightened and clients demanded quality over quantity, the cracks showed. Within two years, they went from “the next big thing” to closing their doors.</blockquote><blockquote>The lesson is clear:</blockquote><blockquote>Growth is not proof of success; sustainability is. “</blockquote><p>This is where two powerful frameworks come together to create a solution.</p><p><strong>1. McKinsey’s Three Horizons of Growth: The Strategic Compass</strong></p><p>The McKinsey Three Horizons model first introduced in The Alchemy of Growth (1999) remains a valuable tool for prioritizing innovation. However, its traditional interpretation has a critical blind spot in the digital age.</p><p>The original model suggests that disruptive innovations (Horizon 3) emerge from long research and development cycles. While this is still true for fields like biotech or energy, the modern trap is failing to recognize that today’s most powerful disruptions often skip this lengthy phase.</p><p>Instead, they are achieved by repurposing existing, mature technologies — like cloud computing, APIs, and mobile platforms — into radical new business models. This is where strategy and user experience intersect:</p><ul><li><strong>Disruption Lies in Business Model &amp; UX: </strong>Companies like Uber, Airbnb, and Instagram didn’t invent new core technologies (GPS, online payments, photo-sharing). They leveraged existing ones to create a fundamentally superior and seamless user experience, which in turn defined a new business model.</li><li><strong>Speed as a Disruptive Force: </strong>The ability to rapidly deploy these experience-driven models creates a powerful advantage. A competitor stuck in the old Horizon 3 mindset is still in R&amp;D, while a UX-focused competitor has already captured the market.</li></ul><p>Therefore, the framework is still useful for categorizing ambitions, but its value for planning disruption is limited. Its full potential is only unlocked when integrated with a deep understanding of how existing technology can be reimagined through user-centric design to create immediate, market-changing value.</p><p><strong>The model guides you to balance your focus across three time horizons:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Horizon 1 (H1): Your Core Business. </strong>This is what pays the bills today. Initiatives here focus on optimizing, defending, and growing your existing operations (e.g., improving checkout conversion rates).</li><li><strong>Horizon 2 (H2): Emerging Opportunities. </strong>These are new ventures that are expected to become your core business in the next 1–3 years (e.g., launching a new product line or entering a new market).</li><li><strong>Horizon 3 (H3): Future Bets. </strong>These are long-term ideas and experiments that could define your future (e.g., R&amp;D for a disruptive technology).</li></ul><p>The failed company in Scenario 2 was likely chasing H3 dreams without a profitable H1 foundation. A sustainable strategy requires actively managing all three.</p><p><strong>2. UXR as a Product Discovery Mindset: The Reality Check</strong></p><p>As Marty Cagan notes in his book INSPIRED, “<em>The few that succeed are usually those that are really good at the product discovery phase</em>.” This is where User Experience Research (UXR) evolves from a mere task into a core mindset.</p><p>It’s the continuous practice of asking:</p><ul><li>“Are we solving the right problem?”</li><li>“Will users actually use this?”</li><li>“Can we build a viable business around it?”</li></ul><p>This UXR mindset is the solution to the “Three Horizons trap.” It replaces long, risky R&amp;D cycles in H3 with a culture of continuous learning, ensuring strategy is guided by evidence from the very beginning.</p><p>This isn’t about occasional testing, it’s about rapidly identifying hidden opportunities to repurpose our existing technologies to solve real user problems with the right analysis. This approach enables the fast, asymmetric disruptions that define modern, sustainable growth.</p><p>This is why I created the Sustainable Growth Flowchart. It’s a practical map that combines these two frameworks, ensuring every growth initiative is grounded in both strategic business planning and user reality.</p><h3><strong>The Sustainable Growth Flowchart: </strong>The Intersection of Business Strategy and User Experience</h3><p>For downloadable file: <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W4pklZ8LLiq68oFk2M32W3cekI-YxhgN/view?usp=drive_link"">check here</a></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Wy-LruGuoDkG0x0dZt4f5Q.png"" /><figcaption>The Intersection of Business Strategy and User Experience — By Lismayasari Annisyah</figcaption></figure><p>Let’s walk through the key decision gates. The entire process is a cycle, governed by ‘Monitor, Measure, and Adapt.’</p><ol><li>Begin with a Ruthless Audit: Defining the Right Problem</li></ol><p>The flowchart starts here because launching into solutions without validating the core problem is a fundamental failure mode in UX and product design. This step embodies a user research (UXR) mindset, systematically deconstructing assumptions through methods such as analytics review, user interviews, surveys, competitive analysis, or journey mapping. The term “ruthless” signifies a commitment to brutal honesty and a willingness to kill ideas if data reveals they are misaligned or ineffective. This audit is not a one-time event; it’s a process for uncovering latent opportunities, such as unmet user needs that could drive retention or acquisition.</p><p>I watched Melanie Perkins, Co-founder and CEO of Canva, explain in Founder Story interviews that their core mission was to “democratize design” making design accessible to non-designers rather than simply adding features to complex tools. Through user research and analytics, they refined the problem statement, which led to a simplified interface and increased adoption among users who were not design experts.</p><p>As I’m in a SaaS product, this might involve auditing my onboarding flow. If drop-off rates are high, user interviews could uncover confusing UX patterns, prompting a redesign that aligns with users’ mental models. Incorporating tools like heatmaps (e.g., Hotjar) is one of many methods that can be used to help identify cognitive biases in our assumptions, ensuring the problem is validated by users (the right problem), not ego-driven.</p><p>2. The First Critical Gate: Product-Market Fit (PMF)</p><p>This is the flowchart’s decisive checkpoint: “Have we achieved Product-Market Fit?” If not, the directive is to return to research; scaling is not permitted. PMF means your product solves a real problem for a well-defined market so effectively that users become habitual adopters. UXR verifies this by connecting to problem/solution fit, GAP analysis, value proposition clarity, Bayesian analysis, or mixed-method research. Also, see metrics like retention, churn rates, or any metrics that fit our business type. Bypassing this gate means investing resources into what the flowchart calls a “broken engine.”</p><p>I read ‘The Slack Origin Story’ by Techcrunch, they explained that Slack serves as a classic example, as it pivoted from a gaming tool to a team communication platform after internal data showed skyrocketing adoption within their own team. Early PMF was validated through strong engagement metrics and user feedback, which justified scaling efforts. Regarding this, UX people can conduct cohort analysis, if users return daily and refer others, you likely have PMF.</p><p>If not, iterate on core features using qualitative insights, bayesian analysis, the buyer’s/user journey, or any method that can map the system.</p><p>We maybe familiar with Airbnb, they achieved PMF by focusing on high-quality photos and trust-building UX elements, converting skeptical users into advocates. This gate prevents startups from burning capital on unvalidated ideas, reinforcing user experience as the foundation of market resonance.</p><p>3. Set Goals and Select Your Lever: Balancing Growth Strategies</p><p>Once PMF is confirmed, the flowchart directs you to establish measurable goals such as KPIs for user acquisition or churn reduction and choose appropriate growth levers. This draws on the Ansoff Matrix: Market Penetration (deepening engagement within existing markets), Product Development (building new features for current users), Market Development (bringing existing products to new markets), or Diversification (launching new products in new markets). It’s critical to align these with strategic time horizons: H1 (short-term optimization), H2 (medium-term expansion), and H3 (long-term innovation) ensuring sustainability without overextending resources. This means UX practitioners can recommend a lever prioritize that enhance user delight, while the company sets up strategic resource allocation.</p><p>Spotify as our favorite music player, for instance, they employed Product Development (H2) by introducing personalized playlists, which increased retention among existing users, while also pursuing Market Penetration (H1) through free-tier offerings in new regions.</p><p>For example, if we have a goal to double user growth, we might choose Market Penetration via UX improvements like a seamless referral program while investing in H3 diversification such as AI-powered features.</p><p>Quartr.com explained that Netflix successfully diversified into original content (H3) after saturating its core streaming market, using data to guide decisions. This balanced approach avoids the “growth at all costs” trap, ensuring UX drives long-term value.</p><p>4. The Alignment Check: The PLG Litmus Test</p><p>Before execution, the flowchart mandates asking: “Are cross-functional teams aligned and adequately funded?” This step operationalizes Product-Led Growth (PLG), where the product itself through intuitive UX drives acquisition, conversion, and expansion, reducing reliance on heavy sales tactics. If marketing, design, engineering, or other teams are not synchronized, the process loops back. This prevents siloed efforts that undermine initiatives. Designers need this alignment to ensure UX remains central. Also, it means funding experiments with clear ownership.</p><p>Ruben Dominguez wrote about The Rise of PLG, explaining that Dropbox mastered PLG by making file-sharing so effortless that users naturally invited others, with cross-functional teams iterating based on evidance and the right problem. Let’s check our business, If your PLG test fails, evidenced by a low viral coefficient, it may stem from misalignment. For example, researcher deliver insights and recommendations about, but marketing have different definition about the findings. Also, design may advocate for user testing, but engineering lacks the resources to implement changes.</p><p>Grammarly is another example: cross-functional alignment around a freemium UX model fueled viral growth without significant marketing spend. This can be initiated by the product, research, or growth department. This check is especially critical in startups, where limited budgets amplify the cost of misalignment.</p><p>The entire process is cyclical, governed by ‘Monitor, Measure, and Adapt, and back to monitor because sustainable growth is never a one-and-done effort.”</p><p>The entire process is cyclical, governed by ‘Monitor, Measure, and Adapt, and back to monitor because sustainable growth is never a one-and-done effort.”</p><h4><strong>As it’s never a one-and-done effort, what’s the truth about business growth?</strong></h4><p>Scaling a business and achieving exponential growth isn’t something impossible. Even though it’s difficult, it can be achieved when a business truly has the right strategy, the right execution, and the right focus.</p><p>It’s also important to understand what actually slows down business growth whether it’s the team, the system, the strategy, or even the mindset and inaccurate knowledge that shape every decision.</p><p>Oh, I know. It’s so easy to say things like, “Just check your business issues, solve them, and you’ll have sustainable growth!”</p><p>Sometimes you already have high-quality services, a brilliant system, and strategic marketing but the real issue is in our mindset or even our immaturity.</p><p>But the good news is: we can always learn, unlearn, and relearn anything.</p><h4><strong>Key reminders for designer growth focused</strong></h4><p>What I’ve learned from my own reflections and insights from product leaders:</p><p>1. Set clear goals; for the day, the week, the month, and the year.</p><p>2. Investigate deeply; look for real opportunities and make sure you’re solving the right problem.</p><p>3. Experiment and iterate; explore concepts with scalability potential or take calculated risks.</p><ul><li>Apply the right product design principles</li><li>Use the right UI patterns and UX laws that work</li><li>Read and interpret data clearly</li><li>Choose effective methods and define the right metrics</li></ul><p>4. Be aware of design responsibility; always consider the impact on both users and the business. Ethics matter.</p><p>Sustainable growth demands both strategic discipline and user-centered insight. Speed alone is not strength. Strength comes from clarity, reflection, and responsible execution.</p><p>My flowchart is not a final answer, but a guide a tool for reflection and decision-making. It exists to replace guesswork with a disciplined, evidence-driven system.</p><p>Now, ask yourself:</p><p>Where does your product currently stand?

December is more than just the holidays. It’s also the beginning of the winter arc. If you’re unfamiliar, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/winter-arc-tiktok-fitness-self-improvement"">winter arc</a> is a social trend centered on building healthy, grounding habits during the colder months. For some, that looks like locking in: doing a full physical and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/digital-decluttering-how-to"">digital declutter</a>, taking a financial audit of your 2025 plans, or creating a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/taylor-cassidy-vision-boarding"">vision board</a> for 2026. Meanwhile, others are embracing a slower hibernation mode, like reading that final book on your TBR list, easing into restorative routines, or slowly crocheting a seasonal sweater.<br /><br />Whatever the approach, it’s all a form of preparation for the year ahead, another 365 days filled with opportunities, challenges, and moments of inspiration to plan for and look forward to. While it’s true that the seconds between December 31, 2025 and January 1, 2026 won’t magically transform our lives, there is a shift in energy that takes place. One that invites us to reflect on our wins, acknowledge the lessons, and give ourselves permission to start fresh in the new year.<br /><br />And while you don’t need anything fancy to tap into that New Year energy, there are tools that can make it easier to manifest, plan, organize, and track your progress. Below, we’re sharing stationery picks, motivational prints, and energy-clearing essentials to help you step confidently into your next chapter.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

Palo santo, a fragrant wood traditionally used in South America, is known for its warm, resinous scent and its ability to create a grounding atmosphere. When burned, it releases a gentle aroma that instantly shifts the tone of a room. Incan cultures believed it offered medicinal and therapeutic benefits, like purifying spaces, and many continue to use it to cleanse and reset. Peruvian-owned lifestyle brand Luna Sundara works with local artisans who sustainably harvest high-quality Palo Santo smudging sticks.<br /><br /><strong>Luna Sundara</strong> Luna Sundara’s Palo Santo Smudging Sticks, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lunasundara.com%2Fcollections%2Fpalo-santo%2Fproducts%2Fluna-sundara-palo-santo-smudging-sticks-from-peru-sustainably-harvested-quality-hand-picked-100-grams-approx-25-sticks&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Flock-in-tools-2026"">Luna Sundara</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1420"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11949367.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1146&amp;height=1420&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=573:710"" width=""1146"" /><figcaption><strong>Bella Doña’s 2026 Planner<br /></strong><br />Next, get organized.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11943891.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>R29 babes, we’ve made it to the final full <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">week of Sag Season</a>, and the energy shift is major. The highlight of this week is Mars leaving Sagittarius and entering Capricorn on December 15th, where it’s exalted, meaning this planet of action and ambition literally feels its best and performs at peak capacity in this earth sign. Mars will be in Capricorn for six weeks, and the collective vibe is shifting from “let’s explore everything!” to “let’s actually build something that lasts.”</p>



<p>This transit activates our discipline and ability to execute long-term goals with strategic precision instead of just spontaneous enthusiasm. Mars in Capricorn wants us focused, productive, and climbing mountains — both literal and metaphorical. But here’s the shadow: this energy can make us workaholics who forget that rest is productive too, or so focused on ending the year strong that we burn ourselves out trying to prove something.</p>



<p>The pressure to “finish 2025 perfectly” might feel intense, but remember: we’re in a 9 year in numerology, which is about spiritual completion and releasing what no longer serves us, not forcing traditional ambition. We’re also in the Year of the Snake in Chinese astrology, which is about shedding skin and dropping deadweight rather than aggressive forward momentum. The real work this week is grounded, consistent action toward goals that will ultimately make you feel lighter, not heavier.</p>



<p>Luckily, we still have <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">some Sagittarius fire</a> to balance all that Capricorn earth, because <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury just entered Sag</a> and the sun is wrapping up its tour here too. This blend of fire and earth is actually perfect: the Sagittarius energy keeps us optimistic, fun-seeking, and dreaming big while the Capricorn energy helps us figure out what practical steps we need to take to make those dreams real. You’re allowed to have fun and be productive, to set ambitious goals and take strategic action, to dream and build.</p>



<p>The key is not letting Mars in Capricorn convince you that grinding is the only path forward, or that your worth is measured by how much you accomplish before the year ends. The fire reminds us to enjoy the process, the earth reminds us to show up consistently — both are necessary. If you’re feeling torn between wanting to party through the holidays and feeling guilty that you’re not working hard enough, that’s this cosmic tension playing out. Give yourself permission to do both, intentionally.</p>



<p>And speaking of dreaming big: the New Moon in Sagittarius on December 19th is one of the most uplifting, hopeful lunar resets of the entire year. This is the final new moon of 2025, which means it’s your cosmic invitation to set intentions without playing small, to dream so big it feels uncomfortable, and to ask yourself: where could I be six months from now if I actually believed in my potential? Sagittarius energy is about expansion, optimism, and trusting that the universe wants you to win — this is not the new moon for realistic, practical goals (that’s what Mars in Capricorn is for). This is the new moon for vision-boarding your dream life and taking one bold action that proves you’re serious about it. The cosmic assignment for this week is clear: set intentions like your dreams are already real, take consistent action with Mars in Capricorn’s support, and trust your gut with Jupiter in Cancer’s wisdom.</p>

<p>Aries, the final <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">week of Sag Season</a> is lighting up your expansion sector, and honestly, you’ve been living your best adventurous life. But the energy shifts dramatically on December 15th when Mars (your ruler) enters Capricorn and your career sector for the next six weeks. This is huge — Mars is exalted in Capricorn, meaning your ambition, drive, and professional focus are about to be unstoppable.</p>



<p>You’re entering your “build the empire” era where disciplined action toward career goals feels natural instead of forced. The next six weeks are perfect for promotions, launching businesses, or simply showing up professionally with the kind of consistency that creates lasting success. But here’s the shadow: Mars in Capricorn can make you such a workaholic that you forget fun exists, or so focused on climbing that you burn out before you reach the top. Remember that rest is strategic, not lazy, and your career success is more sustainable when you’re not sacrificing your entire life for it.</p>



<p>The New Moon in Sagittarius on December 19th lands in your expansion sector and it’s giving “dream so big it scares you” energy. This is the final new moon of 2025, so set intentions around travel, higher learning, entrepreneurship, or simply expanding your worldview in ways that feel impossible right now. Act as if you’re already living your dream life six months from now. This new moon is ruled by Jupiter in Cancer, which is activating your home sector. Maybe you’re expanding your idea of what home means, planning to move somewhere that supports your growth, or simply realizing that your foundation needs to evolve to hold your bigger dreams. Set intentions that honor both your need for adventure and your need for emotional security… you don’t have to choose between exploring the world and having roots.</p>

On December 15th, Mars enters Capricorn and your expansion sector for six weeks, giving you the disciplined drive to finally take action on travel plans, educational pursuits, or philosophical growth you’ve been contemplating. Mars in Capricorn wants your expansion strategic and sustainable, not just spontaneous and scattered. You might feel motivated to book the trip, enroll in the course, or commit to beliefs that require consistent practice instead of just inspiration. The shadow is becoming so focused on planning your expansion that you forget to actually experience it, or turning growth into another checklist instead of an adventure.</p>



<p>The New Moon in Sagittarius on December 19th activates your transformation and shared resources sector with “benevolent billionaire” energy. This is your cosmic invitation to set intentions around the kind of wealth, intimacy, and power you want to embody in the next six months. What does abundance look like when you’re not just surviving but thriving? What partnerships (romantic or financial) would actually support your evolution? This week’s new moon is ruled by Jupiter in Cancer, which is lighting up your communication sector, so your words have extra manifestation power right now. This is one of the best times to speak your dream life into existence… literally say out loud what you’re calling in around money, shared resources, and transformation. You can manifest through honest conversations about what you need financially and emotionally. Trust that speaking your desires clearly is the first step toward materializing them.</p>

<p>Cancer, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Sag Season is wrapping up</a> in your wellness and daily routine sector, and you’ve been experimenting with making self-care feel more adventurous. On December 15th, Mars in Capricorn enters your partnership sector for six weeks, giving you the drive to take serious action on relationships. Mars in Capricorn wants your connections disciplined, committed, and built on solid foundations; this is about showing up consistently in partnerships instead of just when it feels easy.</p>



<p>You might feel motivated to have difficult relationship conversations, set boundaries you’ve been avoiding, or simply put in the work to build partnerships that last. Avoid becoming so focused on fixing relationships that you lose the softness, or treating connections like another responsibility instead of something you actually enjoy. Let Mars help you build sustainable partnerships, but don’t sacrifice emotional intimacy for the appearance of stability.</p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>

But on December 15th, Mars enters Capricorn and your wellness sector for six weeks, shifting your focus to routines, health, and daily discipline. Mars in Capricorn wants you taking your self-care seriously… this is about building sustainable habits instead of just spontaneous wellness moments. You might feel motivated to commit to consistent workouts, create structured morning routines, or finally address health issues with strategic action instead of just positive thinking.</p>



<p>This transit’s shadow is becoming such a perfectionist about your routines that you lose the joy, or treating your body like another project that needs to be optimized for maximum performance. Let Mars help you build daily discipline, but remember that wellness is about feeling good, not just looking productive.</p>



<p>The New Moon in Sag on December 19th lands in your creativity, romance, and joy sector, and it’s basically the universe handing you permission to play without guilt. This is the final new moon of 2025, so set intentions around the kind of creative expression, romantic connections, and pleasure you want to experience in the next six months. What would you create if you knew it would be celebrated? Who would you love if you trusted they could handle your light? This new moon is ruled by Jupiter in Cancer, which is activating your solitude and healing sector, creating an interesting blend between public expression and private processing. Maybe you’re realizing that your best creative work comes from the healing you’re doing in private, or that romance feels safer when you’ve processed your own patterns first. Set intentions that honor both your need to shine and your need to do inner work… sometimes the most magnetic thing you can create is what emerges after you’ve healed. Trust your intuition about what actually brings you joy versus what just gets applause.</p>

Mars in Capricorn wants your self-expression strategic, your romantic life intentional, and your pleasure productive (yes, even fun gets organized with this transit). You might feel motivated to commit to creative routines, pursue romantic connections with clear intentions, or simply show up to your joy with consistency instead of waiting for inspiration. But beware of becoming so serious about fun that you forget to actually enjoy it, or turning creativity into another checklist where nothing feels good enough. Let Mars help you build sustainable creative practices, but remember that play is most powerful when it’s spontaneous, not scheduled.</p>



<p>The New Moon in Sag on December 19th activates your home sector, asking you to dream big about your foundation. This is the final new moon of 2025, so set intentions around the kind of living situation, family dynamics, and emotional roots you want to cultivate.

Mars in Capricorn wants your foundation solid, and your living situation functional. You might feel motivated to move, renovate, set boundaries with family, or simply create a home environment that supports your goals instead of just housing your stuff. The shadow of this transit is becoming so focused on fixing your foundation that you create more stress than stability, or treating home like another project that needs to be perfected. Let Mars help you build the sanctuary you need, but don’t sacrifice emotional comfort for the appearance of having it together.</p>



<p>The New Moon in Sag on December 19th lands in your communication sector, and it’s asking you to dream big about your voice. This is the final new moon of 2025, so set intentions around how you want to express yourself, what conversations you want to have, and what ideas you want to share over the next six months.

On December 15th, Mars, your planetary ruler, enters Capricorn and your communication sector for six weeks, giving your words serious power and your ideas strategic execution. Mars in Capricorn wants you to use your voice to build something that lasts. You might feel motivated to finally write that thing, have important professional conversations, or speak up in situations where you usually stay quiet. The shadow of this transit is becoming so intense in how you communicate that people feel attacked instead of informed, or treating every conversation like a strategic negotiation instead of genuine connection. Let Mars help you express yourself powerfully, but remember that impact doesn’t require force… sometimes clarity is enough.</p>



<p>The New Moon in Sag on December 19th activates your money sector and it’s giving “abundant AF” energy. This is the final new moon of 2025, so set intentions around the kind of financial reality you want to be living in six months.

This new moon is ruled by Jupiter in Cancer, which is lighting up your expansion and belief sector, creating a powerful connection between what you believe is possible and what you can actually manifest financially. Maybe you’re realizing that your money story is directly connected to your worldview, or that abundance requires you to expand your beliefs about what you’re allowed to have.

Trust your intuition about which financial moves will actually create the freedom you’re seeking… your gut knows the difference between strategy and scarcity.</p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>

This transit is about creating financial stability that supports your adventures instead of just winging it with optimism. During Mars in Cap, you might feel motivated to budget seriously, pursue income opportunities with discipline, or simply get honest about the difference between abundance mindset and actual money management. The shadow is becoming so focused on making money that you forget why you wanted financial freedom in the first place, or grinding so hard for security that you lose the joy.

Our choice pick for an unforgettable gift that’ll impress even the bougiest friend is Aspen, which juxtaposes crisp notes of balsam fir, eucalyptus, and cypress with bright, juicy grapefruit for a result that’s festive yet unexpected. <br /><br /><strong>Jenni Kayne</strong> Aspen Glass Candle, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jennikayne.com%2Fproducts%2Faspen-glass-candle-black%3Fvariant%3D40542366269613"">Jenni Kayne</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2133"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11949748.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1600&amp;height=2133&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1600:2133"" width=""1600"" /><figcaption><h2>Cozy Earth Gather Candle <br /></h2><br />If you have a little less to spend, go for Cozy Earth’s Gather candle.

Nuit Enchantée Luna is like taking a breath of fresh air indoors: zingy bergamot, a sweet petal accord, creamy birchwood, and crunchy green lotus make up the notes that linger long after you’ve blown it out. Even better?

There’s a big difference between giving a gift and <em>really</em> giving a gift. We all know the feeling: something bought quickly just to check a box versus something chosen because it feels like the person it’s meant for. That intentional, personalized spark is exactly what creator <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/alexa.lumley/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Alexa Lumley</a> looks for — and exactly why <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Etsy</a> has become her go-to for discovering gifts that feel thoughtful, meaningful, and deeply personal.<br /> <br />For Lumley, shopping on Etsy isn’t a routine scroll — it’s a moment of connection. “What draws me to Etsy is the thrill of discovery,” she says. “I never feel like I’m just shopping; I feel like I’m getting a peek into someone’s passion — their craft, their story, their point of view.”<br /><br />That look into a maker’s world is what keeps her coming back. She’s drawn to pieces that feel thoughtful and personal — the kind of gift that feels like it was meant for someone in particular. “There’s something so satisfying about finding a piece you didn’t expect, but instantly know it’s the one.”<br /><br />When she’s in gifting mode, Lumley approaches Etsy with equal parts intuition and strategy. She always starts with her “favorite shops” list, but she loves letting the platform lead her somewhere unexpected. Her number-one tip? Use the “similar items on Etsy” section at the bottom of every listing. “Some of my absolute favorite pieces have come from scrolling there,” she says. “The less rigid I am, the better the finds.” It’s her secret to uncovering gifts she never could’ve searched for directly — especially the ones that end up meaning the most.<br /><br />That gift-driven mindset came through clearly when Lumley recently chose presents for her loved ones this holiday: a <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/listing/4325425131/beige-knit-sweater-women-chunky-ribbed?click_key=01f6a6ef50347b8ea87a031af0bf0051%3ALTb705faea2f8f2c1ee9dbd8d3158b1f7437eff5fe&amp;click_sum=4c05e97b&amp;ls=r&amp;ref=rlp-listing-grid-1&amp;external=1&amp;sr_prefetch=0&amp;pf_from=rlp&amp;sts=1&amp;content_source=01f6a6ef50347b8ea87a031af0bf0051%253ALTb705faea2f8f2c1ee9dbd8d3158b1f7437eff5fe"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">luxuriously cozy handmade sweater</a> for her mother, an incredible <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/listing/984862301/rustic-christmas-natural-linen?click_key=01f6a6ef50347b8ea87a031af0bf0051%3ALT6983f6892946084e2e7d8ffdca22b905748dfa2c&amp;click_sum=ce78f421&amp;ls=r&amp;ref=rlp-listing-grid-2&amp;external=1&amp;sr_prefetch=0&amp;pf_from=rlp&amp;pro=1&amp;frs=1&amp;sts=1&amp;content_source=01f6a6ef50347b8ea87a031af0bf0051%253ALT6983f6892946084e2e7d8ffdca22b905748dfa2c"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">linen tablecloth</a> for her sister, and a <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.etsy.com/listing/4352700156/handmade-ceramic-spoon-rest-fun-kitchen?click_key%3D01f6a6ef50347b8ea87a031af0bf0051%253ALTfde57492dfa563d42fa87dd6a8600a5da2259f78%26click_sum%3Db06969d3%26ls%3Dr%26ref%3Drlp-listing-grid-3%26external%3D1%26sr_prefetch%3D0%26pf_from%3Drlp%26frs%3D1%26content_source%3D01f6a6ef50347b8ea87a031af0bf0051%25253ALTfde57492dfa563d42fa87dd6a8600a5da2259f78&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1765387408517031&amp;usg=AOvVaw2BGAktedaR7EPU9k0YwrIS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">handmade ceramic spoon rest</a> painted with 'Mediocre Chef'— a cheeky little nod that instantly reminded her of her best friend. ""It was exactly her sense of humor,"" she says. They’re the kinds of gifts that make people say, <em>Wait, where did you find this?</em> — which, for Lumley, is the whole point.<br /><br />Her gifting philosophy mirrors her approach to personal style. “I’m a very visual person,” she explains. Thoughtful photography and cohesive styling help her understand a maker’s intention — something she values deeply when choosing pieces for others. And when she’s unsure, she returns to the mood boards she builds for herself. “If a piece fits the overall vibe, I know I’ll love it long-term. If it doesn’t, it’s usually a reminder that I’m looking at an impulse buy.”<br /><br />Still, her favorite finds are always the unexpected ones, like a recent discovery — a <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/listing/1657422074/baguette-candle-4-wick-beeswax-bread?click_key=c6c50d4b0a1eea25c6109b17be9ec371%3ALT9131757c33e1800154f1f2ed718845f902a7836d&amp;click_sum=a1a8311c&amp;ls=r&amp;ref=rlp-listing-grid-25&amp;external=1&amp;sr_prefetch=0&amp;pf_from=rlp&amp;frs=1&amp;sts=1&amp;content_source=c6c50d4b0a1eea25c6109b17be9ec371%253ALT9131757c33e1800154f1f2ed718845f902a7836d"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">baguette candle</a> so realistic it made her think of a friend who loves to host dinner parties as much as she loves good food.<br /><br />This Etsy magic is what keeps Lumley returning to the platform for gifting again and again: it bridges the gap between wanting to give something nice and wanting to give something thoughtful. It’s where craft becomes connection and discoverability is mixed with soul. “When a piece feels so specific to someone you love, it makes the discovery feel even more special.”<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSAeag3kdaU/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA=="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Watch her video</a> to explore the personalized Etsy gifts she chose for the people she loves.<figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948354.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><h2>Handmade Ceramic Spoon Rest</h2><br />For the home cook whose kitchen tells a story—splattered sauces, big laughs, and all.

</div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11945554.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Every January, I set big intentions: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tal-hydration-water-bottle-review"">drink twice as much water</a>, hit <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/03/11866324/the-girls-spot-womens-only-gym-trans-women-ban-backlash"">the gym</a>, and see my friends more. Without fail, life usually gets in the way, and most fizzle out, but one rule I always stick to is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/skincare-products-you-dont-need"">taking good care of my skin</a>. </p>



<p>As a beauty director, I know too many dermatologists <em>not</em> to. (Yes, I’ve been scolded for not removing my makeup properly — it’s a little embarrassing.) But making — and keeping — skincare resolutions doesn’t have to feel like a chore. Often, even small changes can build the foundation for skin you’re happy with.</p>



<p>Ahead, I asked a top dermatologist for their practical skincare resolutions for 2026. Believe me — these are goals you’ll actually want to follow in January and beyond.</p>



<h2>Skip the ‘good vs. bad’ ingredient apps</h2>



<p>There’s no shortage of apps and websites that screen skincare ingredients and label them “safe” or “unsafe” for your skin — but dermatologist <a href=""https://drophelia.com/?srsltid=AfmBOor1SZ0zAioqHnSNhEuCEpxXtxjuHiSp-ltwTen9UrhqlRGBraRo"">Dr. Ophelia Veraitch</a> isn’t convinced. “I haven’t found the apps to help screen ingredients very accurate,” says Dr. Veraitch. </p>



<p>Instead, she recommends that patients prone to unexplained irritation or sensitivity cross-check their products against an allergy list. The <a href=""https://dermnetnz.org/topics/baseline-series-of-patch-test-allergens"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">North American Baseline Series</a> — often used by dermatologists — is a standard list of allergens most commonly known to cause contact dermatitis, meaning skin irritation like redness or dry, cracked skin caused by direct contact with an allergen. If your skin doesn’t react to your skincare or cosmetics, there’s generally little need to cross-check.</p>



<h2>Supercharge sunscreen with these key ingredients</h2>



<p>If you’re an R29 regular, this might sound obvious: “<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-sunscreen-spf-oily-skin"">Daily, year-round sunscreen</a> is the single most impactful habit for preventing premature aging and reducing the risk of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mole-mapping-experience-melanoma"">skin cancers</a>,” says Dr. Veraitch, who recommends a high-factor (SPF 30–50), <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wearing-sunscreen-spf-daily-affordable"">broad-spectrum facial sunscreen</a>. But if you really want to maximize its protective benefits, consider layering a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-vitamin-c-serum"">vitamin C</a> or vitamin E serum underneath. “Both ingredients help neutralize free-radical damage,” says Dr. Veraitch, basically things like pollution and UV rays. “They also support collagen,” she adds, which keeps skin supple.</p>



<p>Opt for a gentle vitamin C serum like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fmulti-antioxidant-radiance-serum-with-vitamin-c-P516231%3F"">The Ordinary’s Multi-Antioxidant Radiance Serum with Vitamin C and Ginseng</a>, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2F12-pure-vitamin-c-anti-aging-face-serum-pimprod2012322%3Fsku%3D2556946"">La Roche-Posay 12% Pure Vitamin C Anti-Aging Face Serum</a>. If you tend to have dry, easily irritated skin, vitamin E is naturally more moisturizing and can help protect your skin barrier — the outermost layer that keeps good stuff in (like moisture) and bad stuff out (like bacteria). Try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fsuper-serum-5-in-1-renewing-face-serum-pimprod2041031%3Fsku%3D2615445"">Olay Super Serum 5-in-1 Renewing Face Serum</a>.</p>





<h2>Try tranexamic acid for hyperpigmentation</h2>



<p>From vitamin C to glycolic acid, there are a handful of ingredients dermatologists recommend <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/07/11453847/hyperpigmentation-scale-dark-skin-esthetician-advice"">for hyperpigmentation</a>, often caused by acne, superficial burns, or too much sun exposure. But according to Dr. Veraitch, there’s nothing quite like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/10/11131505/melasma-treatments-dermatologist-shereene-idriss"">tranexamic acid</a>.</p>



<p>“Tranexamic acid is one of the most effective and underutilized ingredients for treating pigmentation,” she says. “What’s more, it helps calm inflammation and targets pathways involved in melasma [a skin condition that causes gray or brown patches], post-inflammatory marks, and uneven skin tone.”</p>



<p>Dr. Veraitch adds that she doesn’t like to chase buzzy new ingredients. Instead, she prefers to see solid data and real-world experience before recommending something to her patients — and there’s <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4235096/"">plenty of research</a> ruling in tranexamic acid’s favor for treating pigmentation.</p>

There’s also <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Ftranexamic-topical-acid-5-pimprod2045655%3Fsku%3D2627359"">Naturium’s Tranexamic Topical Acid 5%</a>, formulated with tranexamic acid, niacinamide, and kojic acid to even out skin tone, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Finnbeauty-project-retinol-remix-1-retinol-treatment-with-peptide-tranexamic-acid-P483127%3F"">INNBeauty Project Retinol Remix 1% Retinol Treatment</a>, with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/rhode-peptide-eye-prep-review"">skin-strengthening peptides</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"">cell-rejuvenating retinol</a>.</p>





<h2>Make mindful drinking part of your skincare goals</h2>



<p>“Alcohol can really exacerbate inflammatory skin conditions such as acne <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sex-trigger-rosacea-flare-up"">and rosacea</a>,” says Dr. Veraitch, who believes January is the perfect time to consider “cutting back and rebalancing the skin” after the festive season. In fact, prioritizing overall wellbeing throughout the year — whether managing stress, exercising more, or seeking help for sleeplessness — is always her top tip. “General health plays a huge role in skin and hair quality,” she emphasizes.</p>



<h2>Where you spray perfume makes all the difference</h2>



<p>If you have sensitive or reactive skin, Dr. Veraitch recommends rethinking where you spray your perfumes and body mists. “Spraying perfume directly onto the skin can trigger contact allergies and make people sensitive to many fragranced skincare products,” says Dr. Veraitch, who has seen this firsthand in her clinic. She adds that perfume is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/perfume-fragrance-hormonal-effects"">absolutely fine and safe to use</a>, but those with sensitivities may do better applying it to clothing rather than directly onto their skin. Fragrance tends to last a lot longer on clothes, anyway. </p>



<h2>Targeted skincare beats blanket injectables</h2>



<p>Dr. Veraitch says many patients book injectables <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/injectable-lip-balm-filler"">like filler</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/preventative-botox-wrinkles-scam-myth"">Botox</a> without first making sure their skin is at its healthiest — think a strong <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-is-skin-barrier-damage-fix"">skin barrier,</a> with minimal irritation. Of course, R29 is a judgment-free zone when it comes to treatments, but if you <em>are</em> considering injectables, Dr. Veraitch advises seeing a dermatologist for a targeted treatment plan first: “Clear, healthy skin means you’re not constantly ‘chasing’ signs of aging with fillers,” she says. A dermatologist, facialist, or esthetician can help you build a skincare plan that suits your budget.</p>



<h2>Consider making laser part of your skincare plan</h2>



<p>If your skincare budget extends to treatments in 2026, Dr. Veraitch can’t speak more highly of Fraxel Dual, a non-ablative laser she says improves skin texture, pigmentation, and overall radiance in a long-lasting way. “It’s one of the most effective ways I’ve seen to ‘reset’ the skin,” says Dr. Veraitch, who regularly recommends the treatment to her patients.</p>



<p>And it’s not just cosmetic. “Recent data from Harvard dermatologists has shown that patients who get Fraxel Dual once a year have a 50% <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36728065/"">reduced risk of developing non-melanoma</a> skin cancers,” she adds. That said, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-uv-filters-spf-45-sunscreen"">wearing sunscreen</a> and limiting your time in the sun is just as effective — and remains a top dermatologist recommendation. There’s no need to spend a small fortune, either. “People often believe that the more expensive the product, the better the results — but that’s rarely true,” says Dr. Veraitch. “Using the right and good quality actives, plus a decent SPF for your skin, matters far more than price.”</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948030.jpg?resize=150%2C150"" /><figcaption>Digital image creation of the Mars planet.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>After <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">months of planetary retrogrades</a>, we are finally regaining our energy. For the first time since the start of 2024, Mars is shining boldly in Capricorn, giving us the enthusiasm to move forward. This is the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/december-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">cosmic glow-up</a> we’ve been waiting for! Now, we can move into the new year with a more refined and ardent mindset. So, set your calendar for December 15th to feel the energetic shift. </p>



<p>Mars in Capricorn is a powerful placement for the action planet. Capricorn is a cardinal sign that likes to get things done and won’t stop until it achieves its goal. When Mars and Capricorn collide, it utilizes strategy and ambition to achieve its goals. During this transit, we focus on the long-term agenda rather than short-term plans, ensuring that our goals come to fruition through planning and discipline. We can succeed at whatever we put our mind to, as long as our visions are well thought out and leave no room for error.</p>



<p>Surely, you must be aware that Mars in Capricorn brings out our <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/women-high-libido"">highest sex drives</a>? However, we aren’t ones to look for frills or fancy lovemaking; instead, we often prefer a straightforward approach to hooking up (Mars in Capricorn works and plays hard at the office and in the bedroom). But we tend to lean into the simple pleasures of life. Capricorn is an earth sign that likes decadence just as much as its cohorts; the sea goat doesn’t kiss and tell and keeps it low-key. </p>



<p>It’s important to note that Mars in Capricorn can take matters to the extreme after being pushed to the edge, which doesn’t take much. The slightest criticism can stir the pot. However, this placement doesn’t necessarily want to engage in arguments — a chill lifestyle is essential. Once they reach a feverish pitch, they will be relentless in proving their points and won’t stop until the other person gives up. Basically, Mars in Capricorn isn’t about to wave a white flag in the air; they’ll keep it going until an authentic apology is given.</p>



<p>We may be a little pushy and want to expedite matters because we want them to happen at top speed. It’s great to be excited about relationships, as we want to fulfill our aspirations in every area of our lives; however, we must respect other people’s boundaries. Although Mars in Capricorn is very compliant to their needs, this placement can be a little aggressive and force us to ignore limits that are set in partnerships.</p>



<p>All in all, Mars in Capricorn is a glorious time to expand our horizons, as long as we don’t hold back. By aligning with the cosmic forces at play, we can flourish and bring our dreams to life. Most importantly, take this time as an opportunity to prioritize self-care and do something great for yourself. Give yourself TLC!</p>
