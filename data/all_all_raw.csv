<p><strong>Abstract</strong> - Located on the hillside of a residential neighborhood, as an extension of the Jules Ferry school complex, the new <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/cebazat"">Cébazat</a> leisure center is a compact, single-story building. This new facility restructures the entrances, playgrounds, and walkways of the nursery and primary schools, while blending harmoniously into its surroundings. Its multi-sloped roof promotes smooth integration into the urban fabric and creates generous interior volumes, giving the place a warm, homely atmosphere that is suitable for children. The building comprises three large activity rooms and two multi-purpose dormitories, all facing east towards the playgrounds and educational areas. A wide central circulation area, bathed in natural light, also serves as a living space in its own right. Designed to provide a healthy, fun, and eco-friendly environment, the building has a timber frame, straw insulation, and exposed beams. The hemp block partitions and earth plaster reinforce this bio-based design, rooted in living materials.</p>",

<h4>Beneath Spotify’s algorithmic charm lies a growing problem: a platform flooded with songs made by no one.</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zfXa_RV7wghv9shRcO7ycw.png"" /><figcaption>Image of a robot singing and playing Guitar</figcaption></figure><p>Music has always been important in my household, I have fond and vivid memories of mornings starting off the day with my dad playing Otis Redding’s Sitting on the Dock of the Bay on the record player. Songs have always been a source of connection for me and my Dad, he’d send me over his recommendations via spotify and I’d happily listen to em, even though most of the time they were stuck in the 60’s. Recently that changed when I started receiving AI generated music from him along with a text reading “Have you heard of this artist Mel McCoy from the Country Bayou Blues band? I’ve attached the image so you guys can see why I hadn’t heard of the artist…</p><p>Music has always been important in my household. I have fond and vivid memories of mornings starting off the day with my dad playing Ottis Redding’s Sitting on the Dock of the Bay on the record player. Music was how we connected. So over the years, he’d send me Spotify recommendations, mostly stuck in the ’60s, oftentimes some repetitive blues songs, I’d happily listen, grateful for that small bridge between generations and to connect with my dad.</p><p>Then one morning, that bridge cracked.</p><h3>The Fake Artist Incident</h3><p>My dad texted me: <em>“Have you heard of Mel McCoy from the Country Bayou Blues Band?”</em> Attached was a Spotify link and an image of a haggard old blues man in a cowboy hat. While my knowledge of wrinkly blues men ain’t bad, I hadn’t heard of him…because well, he didn’t exist. The song was AI-generated, a synthetic blues track wrapped in a fake persona.</p><p>That small exchange, sent a jolt through me. It made me realize how quickly the ground beneath us was shifting. Spotify was now quietly filling with music made by absolutely no one at all.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/630/0*55WU9Pc0Fb0iBzXT.jpg"" /><figcaption>AI image of blue man named Mel McCoy</figcaption></figure><h3>Spotify’s AI Crackdown (the Numbers That Don’t Add Up)</h3><p>Recently, Spotify announced that it had removed more than <a href=""https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-09-25/spotify-strengthens-ai-protections/""><strong>75 million “spammy” AI-generated tracks</strong></a> from the platform. Hard to believe as they purport to have just over <a href=""https://newsroom.spotify.com/company-info/"">100 million tracks in total</a>, which would mean more than half of its entire catalogue was removed if taken at face value. The company framed it as a victory for authenticity, but the scale strains belief and it its true that nearly two-thirds of their music was AI generated, then that is a grave proposition.</p><p>If there were truly that many synthetic songs circulating, then AI-generated music isn’t some fringe experiment, it’s a massive part of the musical ecosystem. And if the number is inflated, then Spotify is trying to control the narrative rather than the problem. Either way, the message is clear: AI music is no longer a nightmare of Spotify’s future. It’s the present.</p><p>In some ways, it feels like Spotify has been preparing us for this shift for years. Its earliest “AI” features felt benign verging on kinda fun! Personalized recommendations, <em>Discover Weekly</em>, and shared “Blend” playlists that merged two people’s tastes to create a musical mutant baby. Then came <em>Daylists</em>, those weirdly specific playlists titled things like <em>spaced out international wednesday afternoon</em>. Note by note, Spotify has moved from being a place to explore music to a place where music finds you.</p><p>I admit, these features are annoyingly convenient. But they beg a deeper question: what problem is Spotify really trying to solve?</p><p>Unfortunately the answer is obvious, like every platform these days, its engagement. Keep you listening for as long as possible. That’s why songs automatically roll into “radio” mode after they end, and why playlists refresh endlessly.</p><p>At first, I loved it. It felt like I had a tiny DJ whose only job was to find me music to listen to. But eventually I realized that those recommendations don’t actually mirror how I used to discover music. I used to discover music through friends, conversations, cafés, record stores, or god forbid, even the radio!</p><p>It might sound quaint or cheugy, but discovery used to be an act of active participation. Music discovery was something you <em>got to do</em>, not something that was done <em>for</em> you.</p><p>Music is a deeply personal experience, which is very different from a deeply <strong>personalized</strong> one. And because we don’t understand how Spotify’s algorithms steer us, it’s hard to know whose interests they really serve. Maybe they’re agnostic, maybe they just wanna be like an enthusiastic record store employee (I know it’s an oxymoron) but more likely, their purpose isn’t sharing art that they care about, it’s retention!</p><h3>The Quiet Rise of AI Music</h3><p>Over the past year, AI-generated music on Spotify has exploded. Despite public statements about regulation and moderation, the company’s behavior suggests a more grey relationship with synthetic sound.</p><p>In 2024, Spotify updated its <strong>User Agreement</strong> to give itself broad, perpetual rights over anything users upload or create. Many artists feared that language could allow the company to train AI systems on their recordings or generate derivative tracks, a concern Spotify dismissed but never fully clarified.</p><p>The fear is obvious, Spotify could use its vast dataset, every stream, skip, and playlist to generate music that sounds “good enough” to replace the real thing. By leveraging artists’ work, it could create AI versions of them, cut out the original creators, and pocket the difference. It sounds dystopian, but economically, it makes sense. Spotify’s business model rewards quantity over quality. AI-generated music offers infinite supply at almost no cost.</p><p>You might think, well, I would never listen and fully enjoy AI music but I know from experience that more and more you won’t know. A lot of people, myself included have become passive participants in this weird musical system. When we pick playlists “for vibes” Chill Jazz, Study Lo-Fi, Relaxing Guitar, we rarely check who made the tracks. And those playlists are rife with artists that are aliases for production collectives or outright AI projects. The music is serviceable, mood-fitting, and free of friction. But every AI track streamed is a quiet rehearsal for a world where human artistry might become optional.</p><p>My mom, for example, listens to AI music happily. She finds it catchy and harmless. She doesn’t go to concerts, so why does it matter who made the song? My dad, meanwhile, has become paranoid. He now messages me links, asking, “Is this one real?”</p><p>Between them lies the cultural crossroads we’re all standing at: comfort on one side, paranoia on the other.</p><h3>Follow the Incentives</h3><p>For Spotify, the math is hard to ignore: AI-generated songs mean no royalties, no scheduling conflicts, no egos. Just endless, on-brand audio that never sleeps. For musicians, that means competing not with each other but with tailor made algorithms that can make a million forgettable songs overnight.</p><p>We’re already seeing this battle spill into court. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/jun/25/record-labels-sue-ai-song-generator-apps-copyright-infringement-lawsuit""><strong>Universal Music Group</strong> and the <strong>RIAA</strong> have sued AI startups like <strong>Suno</strong> and <strong>Udio</strong></a> for training on copyrighted works without permission. Those cases will define whether training an AI on music constitutes infringement and the outcome will determine how far platforms like Spotify can go before crossing a legal line.</p><p>If those lawsuits fail, the floodgates open.</p><p>In my opinion, Spotify isn’t resisting AI, it’s refining it. The company’s policies and incentives point toward a future where the platform doesn’t just <em>curate</em> music but <em>creates</em> it. Probably a bit paranoid, but in this age of AI where everything seems to quickly get gobbled up and regurgitated by LLM’s its not an unreasonable paranoia. I hope for a future where we could simply filter out AI generated music. Spotify doesn’t seem to mind so far and their morally grey track record makes me worry. I hope things don’t go in this direction, because for me, music without a maker isn’t music at all.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a4d6729c715b"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/spotify-has-an-ai-problem-a4d6729c715b"">Spotify has an AI problem</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Prioritise meaning over features.</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*djntMZYajhgtJ0eDUHS_Sw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Apple’s Think Different narrative ad, © Apple Inc</figcaption></figure><p>We, human beings, are fundamentally narrative creatures. We all need a story to live, our brains are wired to make sense of our world and ourselves through stories. Friedrich Nietzsche said, “<em>He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how”</em>. Stories attempt to answer our why questions.</p><p>Earliest cave paintings and the latest Pixar movie are a testament to our enduring fascination with stories. We will continue to be captivated by them even through the times of AI.</p><h4><strong>Why narrative matters</strong></h4><p>Jordan Peterson says, “<em>It is the near-simultaneous discovery by literary critics, researchers into robotics and artificial intelligence, cognitive scientists and neuropsychologists alike that we do and even must perceive reality through a story. Or more accurately, they discovered that a story is a portrayal of the structure through which we perceive reality.”</em></p><p>Our world is too complex to navigate without direction and purpose. To help us make sense of our reality, we create narratives that help filter and focus on what matters.</p><p>The real-life stories that inspire us, the fictional stories that stretch our imagination, business stories that motivate us, and ideological stories that unite or divide us evolve into overarching meta-narratives we inhabit, whether we are aware of it or not. Surprisingly, we are often drawn to the ones that help us cope with our struggles and the wounds we carry. They attempt to provide answers to our deeper human need for identity, belonging, significance, purpose, and transcendence.</p><p>For example, “<em>The American Dream</em>” is a popular cultural meta-narrative in which the story of prosperity and success is attainable through hard work, grit, and determination. “<em>Rags to Riches</em>” is another story archetype of a journey from poverty or obscurity to a position of great wealth, success, or fame. Many such meta-narratives exist. They could be of a political, cultural, ethnic, historical, or religious nature.</p><p>It is essential to recognise that we all inhabit such meta-narratives, and they hold utmost importance personally. Whatever doesn’t fit one’s narrative often fails to register as meaningful or important.</p><p>When a business wants to be successful, the narratives its customers inhabit, shaped by the challenges they face, the emotions they experience, and the aspirations they strive for, must be at the heart of the company’s story.</p><h4><strong>Understanding story design</strong></h4><p>Steve Jobs, the great business storyteller, said, “<em>The most powerful person in the world is the storyteller. The storyteller sets the vision, values and agenda of an entire generation that is to come.”</em></p><p>However, in 1983, when he launched Lisa, he released a nine-page ad in the New York Times, explaining all its technical features, which nobody outside of NASA was interested in. The computer failed. But after he left Apple, his experience at Pixar or Nike’s <em>‘Just do it’ </em>campaign may have convinced him of the power of story. That’s why when he returned, his understanding of the business changed. He focused on the emotions, frustrations, and aspirations of their customers who felt they were the crazy ones, misfits and rebels. Then he said to them, “<em>Think different”</em></p><p>Earlier, Apple’s story was all about itself. Its new story is its customer’s story. “<em>(1) It identified what their customers wanted (to be seen and heard), (2) idefined their customers’ challenges (that people did not recognise their hidden genius), and (3) offered their customers a tool they could use to express themselves emotionally (computers and smartphones).</em>”</p><p>While facilitating <em>Kintsugi Story</em> workshops at <em>Mountain Retreat</em>, I am slowly coming to learn how different circumstances draw us to particular narratives. They could be our existential needs, psychological wounds, childhood formation, past experiences, social status, and so on.</p><p>In a story, what the character wants and aspires to become is often perceived as a cure for the fears/trauma the character encountered in the past.</p><p>In fiction writing, they call it a character’s ghost; it is something in your character’s past that haunts him in the present. Every person carries their past wounds and struggles. Our perception of our world is shaped by the wounds and fears that our past experiences have created. These may not always be very traumatic incidents; they could be small feelings of neglect, inability or instability, etc., during childhood. Fortunately for some, those wounds heal, leaving scars nevertheless.</p><p>Apple’s core audience for its personal computer was artists, designers, and students, who often felt like outsiders in the technology space. They felt people did not recognise their hidden genius; they felt neglected. Apple echoed their emotions and praised their perceived identity as the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels. The <em>Think Different</em> narrative resonated with these people because Apple cared about their frustrations and told a transformative story.</p><p>I want to call Steve Jobs a great business story-thinker, not just a storyteller, because he designed his business around his customers’ narrative. He created products and services that showed a better future. This created a lasting impact on his customers because he empathised with their emotional needs and the fears they carried.</p><p>It is debatable whether Apple’s products truly created a positive impact on our generation. That is a different topic for another day. Nevertheless, the influence was deeper. Story thinking is a powerful skill to either positively transform people or manipulate them. People in power always use it for the latter goal.</p><p>Most people are often ignorant of the narratives we inhabit. But, when someone articulates the story they’re living, it creates a moment of recognition — <em>‘Yes, that’s exactly how I feel.’ </em>Rene Girard said, <em>“Man is the creature who does not know what to desire, and he turns to others in order to make up his mind. We desire what others desire because we imitate their desires.”</em></p><p>Our desires and our narratives are mediated through others, especially our models. Models are those who we are captivated by, those with lofty aims, and we wish, if we are brave, we could be possessed by their spirit. We not only desire the things that they desire, but we also desire to become like them. <em>“All desire is a desire for being.” </em>― Rene Girard.</p><p>If businesses need to make sense to their customers, they need to articulate their story through their models. When people buy Apple products, they are buying into Steve Jobs’ narrative that misfits, creatives, and rebels can become geniuses just like him.</p><p>Apple doesn’t sell computers; they sell “<em>think different</em>”. It’s a narrative about creativity, rebellion against conformity, and belonging to an elite tribe of geniuses.</p><p>Nike doesn’t sell shoes; they sell “<em>the athlete in you</em>”. It’s a ‘hero’s journey’ narrative about overcoming obstacles and achieving one’s potential.</p><p>However, narratives are not just the stories we tell our customers. First, it is the customer’s story we tell ourselves, and then let it inform us in creating products that meet their needs.</p><p>Donald Miller says, “<em>What most brands miss, however, is that there are three levels of problems a customer encounters. In stories, heroes encounter external, internal and philosophical problems. Why? Because these are the same three-level problems human beings face in their everyday lives.</em>” To put it simply, an external problem, which is often tangible, causes our customers to experience an internal frustration, which is philosophically wrong!</p><p>In an era of abundance, great products don’t just solve surface-level problems — they help us become who we want to be. The more brands address the deeper needs for identity, belonging, significance, purpose and transcendence, the more they connect with customers and the broader industry and culture. Mere utility-centred products can be quickly replaced.</p><p>Does it make sense only for multi-billion-dollar companies? No, even a mom-and-pop shop that is empathetic to customers’ needs, fears, and aspirations can become successful.</p><p>Moreover, narrative design is not just for the MVP stage; it is a continuous effort, as narratives must evolve in tandem with cultures.</p><h4><strong>Designing narrative products</strong></h4><p>To build the right narrative for our customers, we need to strengthen our right-hemisphere thinking in our organisations. Unfortunately, most product design and development is dominated by left-hemisphere thinking.</p><p>McGilchrist, in his book ‘<em>The master and his emissary’</em>, argues that the two hemispheres don’t divide tasks by type (logical vs. creative), but rather by how they attend to the world. The left hemisphere offers narrow, focused attention — it grasps things in isolation, categorises, and manipulates. It sees the world as static, knowable, and mechanical. We end up building what we can measure, not what matters. However, the right hemisphere provides broad, sustained attention — it perceives context, relationships, and the whole. It remains open to what is new, ambiguous, and alive.</p><p>He uses the bird foraging for food while watching out for predators as a central analogy for the two hemispheres’ different and often competing modes of attention.</p><p>Narratives are fundamentally right-hemisphere phenomena. You can’t understand a story by dissecting it into data points or features. Narrative dead products may work efficiently, but they lack significance on a deeper level. A more efficient product could easily replace them.</p><p>For example, here is what a pure left-hemisphere restaurant (let’s call it OptimalBite) owner may say, <em>“Our Q3 data shows table turnover averaging 47 minutes. Competitors are at 42. We’re losing 10.6% revenue per seat per day.”</em> Whereas a dominant right-hemisphere owner (let’s call it Nonna’s Kitchen) may say, <em>“Our customers — they’re exhausted. Overworked. Disconnected. They’re hungry for belonging. I want them to feel that they have come to their grandmother’s kitchen in Tuscany. To feel they are home. They belong.”</em></p><p>But when you ask customers from the former restaurant? <em>“It’s fine. It’s convenient. The food is… okay.” </em>What will the customers from the latter restaurant say? <em>“We’ve been coming here for five years. The chef remembered my husband died last year and gave us a special toast in his memory.”</em></p><p>Right-hemisphere thinking involves seeing the whole before the parts, which means capturing context, emotions, and behaviour — that is, understanding products within the customer’s life narrative. This involves asking questions like, How do products fit into the actual lived context of people’s lives? What are the larger cultural/meta narratives at play? What fears and frustrations do they carry?</p><p>Understand which archetypal narrative resonates with your customers. For example, the ‘hero’s journey’, the ‘mastery story’, etc. Which narrative rings true emotionally? What kind of person does this product encourage users to become?</p><p>Ask how your product intersects with customers’ lives. Grasp what the product <em>means </em>metaphorically and philosophically, understanding human connections and their identity formation and see products as part of a journey, not isolated moments or features.</p><p>Right-hemisphere thinking prioritises synthesis over analysis. It fosters ecosystem thinking, allowing for ambiguity and narrative evolution, and remains open to new and unexpected possibilities.</p><p>Story-first businesses begin by studying their customers, the stories they are living, capturing their emotions, frustrations and aspirations. Field trips, contextual enquiries, day-in-the-life immersions, story workshops, model mapping, story pattern mapping, among others.</p><p>Airbnb started as a great story-first company; it was revolutionary. However, today it has drifted to standardisation, efficiency, and algorithms. Now it is like any other hospitality business.</p><p>The key is that right-hemisphere practices don’t replace left-hemisphere rigour — they inform it. Both are necessary. But the right must lead.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zIiGEf8tFvAoP478yBQLpQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Nike’s “Just Do It” narrative ad, 1988 © Nike</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>The ethics of narrative design</strong></h4><p>Narrative design is also a powerful tool for manipulation because it exploits some of the fundamental human emotions and needs.</p><p>In any good story, the protagonist begins believing a lie — a flawed narrative in Act 1 — but is very convinced. However, at the midpoint of Act 2, a crisis point in the story, the protagonist has been struggling under the burden of his lie. At this moment, he finally sees the Truth. When he chooses to accept it (which will cost him a lot, even his life), transformation begins. It leads to a new, wholesome narrative with renewed aspirations.</p><p>Good stories are about people facing challenges that test them. Transformation is the evidence that the test mattered — that going through the fire either forged something stronger or revealed what was already there. Without transformation, we’re left wondering: what was the point of this story?</p><p>People are drawn to narratives that take them from a state of lack to a more complete and fulfilled one, as they perceive it, inspired by their models. Apple iPhone customers may discover that they have become more creative or better storytellers, just like their model Steve Jobs himself.</p><p>Most of the compelling narratives promise transformation. It’s often what separates a good story from a manipulative one. Or a good product from a poor one. A good product is like a wise guide that enables customers’ transformation.</p><p>Customer transformation should be at the heart of a great product narrative, not manipulation, because transformation is valued higher than instant gratification. For example, social media platforms hijack our need for belonging and significance, creating narratives where we’re constantly performing for validation. Manipulative narratives do thrive, but not for long.</p><p>The right hemisphere has a unique capacity to perceive inherent value and meaning. Iain McGilchrist refers to it as valueception. Philosopher Max Scheler originally introduced the concept in his ‘<em>Hierarchy of Values’</em>. He classifies values into a four-rank pyramid, from the lowest to the highest. At the lowest, he places pleasure values, then vital values, and finally spiritual values, such as truth, goodness, and beauty. At the top, he places the sacred values.</p><p>Scheler argued that the <em>depth</em> and <em>quality</em> of the satisfaction we feel is directly tied to the <em>rank</em> of the value it corresponds to. Therefore, products that embody higher-order values such as integrity, honesty, truth, and beauty, in contrast with mere utility value, offer sustained and deeper satisfaction.</p><p>For example, Nonna’s kitchen, which fostered genuine community (spiritual value), is highly valued over Optimalbite, which cared for convenience (pleasure value).</p><p>A transformative story sets the character on a journey to the sacred, whereas a manipulative story takes the character in the opposite direction.</p><p><em>“When a person can’t find a deep sense of meaning, they distract themselves with pleasure” — Viktor Frankl</em>.</p><p>This may sound great now, but does it hold in an Agentic future?</p><h4><strong>Narrative products in Agentic future</strong></h4><p>In a speculative future where we set goals for AI systems to make decisions and act on our behalf, this suggests that customers may not interact with brands directly in that digital space.</p><p>In the Agentic AI paradigm, if customers interact only with AI agents, which in turn interact with multiple brands and systems based on the criteria that are configured, then it appears that brand narratives may lose their power and break the mimetic desire loop, as most products become mere commodities for a narrative agnostic agent.</p><p>If the future unfolds in this way, brand narratives will become even more crucial for products to make sense to customers, or face the fate of extinction in the algorithmic optimisation. Narrative dead products or services will become commodities or mere tasks in a curated algorithmic world.</p><p>However, we humans do not always seek optimal solutions in everything; everyone wants a narrative to live for.</p><p>When agents will have to become the narrative mediators, brands will have to create their narrative agents, and digital products need to become agentic.</p><p>Regardless, physical, embodied experiences will remain crucial because certain narrative elements resist digital mediation — such as community rituals and sensory experiences. Brands need to foster real-world community experiences to strengthen the narrative to meet our deeper need for belonging.</p><p>On the negative side, as social media intensified narratives and their memetic processes exponentially, in the marketplace of Agentic AI, people can be trapped in a narrative echo chamber curated by AI agents. Even worse, governments or institutions can enforce their agents for compliance or control, and kill other narratives. This can be catastrophic for human flourishing. Therefore, it is important to protect ourselves with authentic and transformative narratives that inspire us.</p><p>Designing narrative-driven products and their agents is an emerging area to watch for.</p><p>For further reading<br />1. <a href=""https://www.amazon.in/Whole-New-Mind-Right-Brainers-Future/dp/1594481717/ref=sr_1_1?crid=UAYLS01WIP8S&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.C9nLNzK5RXjGHmsdmK1pGEvTht3bkrxTds-eDTDYAeBBgrhLUj29VJHNvH0d-wjT7xQqndKfi27Fvk1DGsi3o9nZRa07NuptQUTUOSzUW8pffbq3WP0MsxCSJGpMEsoe0hL393p_44mxkb2FIhnub9Mdlu46FTwoZVK4xQPqh-fquSuPkOAYINCQou-o2jH1UibQZk30PZ2E0WU5YOOtK_ItG_ijoCJI1nXWhwLY6Ms.B6oCDgbMJZwTaEMcixR5UwMzD4sMCkocFt3PMGfF5W4&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=whole+new+mind&amp;qid=1760810180&amp;sprefix=whole+new+mind%2Caps%2C232&amp;sr=8-1""><em>A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future</em></a> by Daniel Pink<br />2. <a href=""https://www.amazon.in/MASTER-EMISSARY-EXPANDED-Iain-Mcgilchrist/dp/0300245920/ref=sr_1_1?crid=29DU9JNTGNHEC&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.JdaQFJPcrWnhaAKG_Qc3mefOJ_aCjVR1FjvgqLr-uy1IBbuIIGtr67gicGXIf8KHw7zzYWn6qLT4m5Wmiwq1kNKqhZrOaVmWF3UmAIQ82CdGCqpnHW25Ek7miQb7KDrudi7yJgOgZWk28egmrte7Cw.ArdnNZ2jtL0wcoDk1tdaxcDywDmVz1FZckABU20w188&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=the+master+and+his+emissary&amp;qid=1760810276&amp;sprefix=Master+and+emis%2Caps%2C216&amp;sr=8-1""><em>Master and his emissary</em></a> by Iain Mcgilchrist<br />3. <a href=""https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0141033576/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=A3H3WE9M6NY1KV&amp;psc=1""><em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em></a><em> </em>by Daniel Kahneman<br />4. <a href=""https://www.amazon.in/Story-Structure-Substance-Principles-Screenwriting/dp/0060391685/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2T5OPI4TD6YPM&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.SY6skpwlFjfvpGICdsse9ltgjz9OPwOJqxFjDhKxmvc4mSyFreZQ0Ht9DU-HyUsZA46wPWfPGdMZt8EULsTbdy9u_mRxYEKAMpAePbEnhMFXaLIYmGwavrPK8qNYFfGhffks-IgWVhvLp2RBhPNML57FeG04AUquqeE-_-geoG8iFgGwH5tLelwKZ0jrgezYzFYKDMFpT0W4qtppXWWUxMMs8z-u01_LYXEjd_TZuy4.sVFbNnpG8VtfkWU0pKP4pCO-NJV1GbX7M9KMxffErNQ&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=story+Robert+McKee&amp;qid=1761076967&amp;sprefix=story+robert+mckee%2Caps%2C285&amp;sr=8-1""><em>Story: Style, Structure, Substance, and the Principles of Screenwriting</em></a> by Robert Mckee<br />5. <a href=""https://www.amazon.in/Building-StoryBrand-2-0-Clarify-Customers/dp/1400253713/ref=sr_1_1?crid=18RDQTSZYQC9A&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.m5ARGEL4YoPCtotNv_d85cob0tU7WlMuZtuo83ECSF24x40-lDvuENdI-zW1m7RtMWOjC7f4thXcAGuMHeztJxCZe8e-s0suJrBXMtiCwv48J2gKezJVwnVFQGjFlFn59LXu8ow1OEgEI9b6xq_zZkRVunPWc55-a6IU9UdDxeBQYmMe-JZ1lzntWVn_Se9eT9MZ3MCn2_AQpov3M7jRfQQy17L-pPtnaCsjtC6j6t4.39ONQAfRbgHP4-u7Me73VwV4rNDcNwAegZmWdORCWYQ&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=building+a+story+brand+by+donald+miller&amp;qid=1761077080&amp;sprefix=story+brand+%2Caps%2C222&amp;sr=8-1""><em>Building a StoryBrand 2.0 : Clarify Your Message So Customers Will Listen</em></a> by Donald Millar</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9a50e28caae9"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/right-narratives-shape-lasting-products-9a50e28caae9"">Right narratives shape lasting products</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>The question is no longer what AI might take from us, but how quickly we can hand it over.</h4><figure><img alt=""Scrabble tiles on a blue grid spell “FOMO,” emphasizing the sense of urgency and modern anxiety of missing out. Other tiles are scattered around."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MUaqGyzxim_7TGMDJaUMYQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image source: <a href=""https://workforceexperience.hp.com/blog/ai-fomo/"">https://workforceexperience.hp.com/blog/ai-fomo/</a></figcaption></figure><p>Like many professionals thinking about the future of design, I’m closely following the conversations around AI — both in public forums and in my own circles. But while many focus on the technical capabilities, I’m more interested in the broader narrative shaping these discussions. And recently, based on my observations, that narrative is shifting. The early fear that machines might erode the very qualities that make us human is giving way to a different anxiety—FoMO.</p><p><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563213000800"">FoMO — fear of missing out — is more than a buzzword</a>. Psychologists define it as the anxious belief that others are gaining opportunities or rewards that we’re excluded from. It’s not a fear of loss, but of being left behind while the world moves ahead.</p><p>It seems like only yesterday we were discussing <a href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/19/1075140/how-existential-risk-became-biggest-meme-in-ai/"">existential risks</a>, automation’s threat to work, and the unsettling possibility that <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/03/27/the-intersection-of-ai-and-human-creativity-can-machines-really-be-creative/"">creativity itself might be mechanized</a>. Now we talk mostly about how to “<a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/91278500/how-to-make-generative-ai-a-partner-in-your-daily-workflow"">integrate</a>” AI into our workflows, how to “<a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-stay-competitive-ai-era-openai-cfo-sarah-friar-2025-8"">stay competitive</a>,” and how not to miss the wave.</p><p>So what changed? Have we given up? Or have we simply convinced ourselves that AI won’t harm humanity. More likely, it’s because the rewards of this technology are immediate and obvious, while the costs are slow and subtle.</p><p>AI provides us speed, convenience, and capability — and it offers them now. But the erosion it causes creeps in quietly, almost imperceptibly. And because of this subtle degradation, we fail to treat it with the urgency it deserves.</p><p>However, out of all the potential consequences such as <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2025/04/25/the-jobs-that-will-fall-first-as-ai-takes-over-the-workplace/"">job replacement</a>, <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/03/27/the-intersection-of-ai-and-human-creativity-can-machines-really-be-creative/"">creative outsourcing</a>, and <a href=""https://technologymagazine.com/news/ai-giants-accused-of-the-largest-ip-theft-in-music-history"">intellectual theft</a>, what troubles me most is the silent replacement of human effort with efficiency— a trade that feels harmless in the moment but carries profound consequences over time.</p><p>Take students, for example — a group I see up close. Under the illusion they’re being efficient (or duplicitous in some cases), they utilize AI to generate ideas or complete work, outsourcing the most essential part of learning — the struggle.</p><p>When we skip the messy and difficult decisions that build the foundation of <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-importance-of-taste-and-other-lies-we-tell-ourselves-b5caacddbec4"">judgment</a>, we never develop the critical skills needed to distinguish strong work from weak.</p><p>Judgment is not something we’re born with, it’s something shaped by repeated trial and error. It takes root in wrestling with constraints, making mistakes, and steadily refining our instincts. Remove the struggle, and the capacity for discernment withers.</p><p>A clear example is someone using AI to build a simple landing page. If they don’t know how to code, they can’t judge whether the output is any good — they have to trust the system. Yet AI still makes errors, even on straightforward tasks like citing accurate sources. The same problem appears in design or writing, where assessing quality is even harder for those without expertise.</p><p>This is a major reason why <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16078"">seasoned professionals now hold a greater advantage than ever</a>—they have access to both the tools and the wisdom, while juniors have only the tools — tools that are steadily eroding their ability to gain valuable experience the way pre-AI generations did.</p><p>As individual discernment atrophies, the collective standard drops too. Across disciplines, the more AI fills the space with what many describe as “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_slop"">AI slop</a>”, the less we train ourselves to recognize what is excellent. Culture becomes saturated with “good enough” work that looks polished but lacks substance. Over time, we lose sight of what depth even is.</p><p>This is why effort matters. We stand in awe of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine_Chapel"">Sistine Chapel</a> or are moved by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-fFHeTX70Q"">Beethoven</a> not just because of their beauty, but because they embody human striving. They carry the weight of years, mistakes, and relentless pursuit.</p><p>If a machine produced the same artifacts tomorrow, they might be identical, but their meaning would evaporate. Without elements of human labor — physical or psychological — such art is reduced to decoration.</p><figure><img alt=""A person gazes at the Sistine Chapel’s intricate, colorful ceiling and wall frescoes, depicting biblical scenes with vivid figures and dynamic movement."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y6Q8NXeG2OXzz5fxAKOqzg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>What frustrates me most is that these aren’t side effects — they’re seismic shifts that demand serious attention. Yet our feeds are flooded with influencers and pseudo-experts insisting that AI is good because it frees us from “tedious” work for “higher-level” tasks. There’s some truth in that — yes, that’s how it <em>should</em> be used — but that’s not how it’s actually being used.</p><p>I know because I catch myself leaning on it for tasks I should be able to do — and do quickly — on my own, especially those that require a touch of humanity, like a sympathetic email to a colleague. Or shaping a big idea that should start with my own vision. It’s an unsettling tendency I’m confident others can relate to.</p><p>But all of these concerns are routinely dismissed as inconvenient footnotes to the next AI product launch. And this is all taking place while a <a href=""https://time.com/7322418/chat-gpt-open-ai-nvidia-tech-monopoly/"">handful of corporations</a> — companies like Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and OpenAI — are consolidating control over the infrastructure of culture itself. And we, as spectators, seem willing to watch as they chip away at what makes us human, all in the name of efficiency and our fixation on the next shiny innovation.</p><p>Maybe the most insidious part of this whole phenomenon is how normalized it’s become. Companies slap “AI-powered” onto products that don’t need it, like “gluten-free” labels on steak, because it’s easier to follow the trend than to ask if the trend makes sense.</p><p>Professionals and students panic that they’ll be unemployable if they don’t master these tools. Creatives worry they’ll be irrelevant if they don’t use them. And so everyone piles in — not out of conviction, but out of fear.</p><p>Conversations about purpose and meaning are being drowned out by the noise. These questions still surface, but they disappear beneath the hype faster than new AI startups can cash in.</p><p>And yet, for all this cynicism, hope isn’t gone. The technology is not destiny. It’s a mirror. It reflects our values back at us. If we allow convenience, speed, and efficiency to be our highest values, AI will amplify those — and hollow out everything else. But if we insist on preserving depth, effort, wisdom, and meaning, AI could become a tool that serves those ends rather than undermines them.</p><p>The choice is still ours, though it grows harder with each passing month. Words like these often echo unheard — and that may be the strongest reason to pause now. The real danger isn’t that machines will surpass us, but that in our desperation not to miss out, we’ll forget that being human means sometimes slowing down and doing things the hard way — because that’s how we grow.</p><p><strong><em>Don’t miss out! </em></strong><a href=""https://micbuckcreative.medium.com/subscribe""><strong><em>Join my email list</em></strong></a><strong><em> and receive the latest content.</em></strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=d628aacfb950"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/fear-of-missing-out-on-ai-is-overshadowing-the-fear-of-losing-our-humanity-d628aacfb950"">Fear of missing out on AI is overshadowing the fear of losing our humanity</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>AI can generate text, but only a designer can generate strategy, empathy, and safety.</h4><p>Imagine a neighborhood with no sidewalks or ramps. Someone using a wheelchair or a parent pushing a stroller is immediately forced to drive or rely on others just to run simple errands.</p><p>This planning was intentional: it was designed for cars and against people who need help getting around. Every single choice, from storm drain placement to road approval, was a decision that left people out. Just as poor infrastructure creates physical barriers, unclear language creates digital barriers.</p><figure><img alt=""Minimalist illustration of a suburban street with a light grey asphalt road, a high sidewalk, a streetlamp, and green rolling hills under a light blue sky"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8j6He40LoOSgVN1e5a-8Uw.png"" /><figcaption>An illustration of a grey asphalt road bordered on the right by a high, light-colored sidewalk with a distinct, vertical curb — (Grant Yun).</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve recently become responsible for most of the UX writing on my product team, handling everything from button labels to complex error flows, and I know I’m not alone. In countless organizations, product designers are often the ones filling in the final text. Because this is usually the last step, it’s easy to treat the content as a quick fill-in, something you automate or even turn to AI to quickly generate.</p><p>Over time, I’ve realized that this perspective misses the point. <strong>The writing is the design.</strong> The rise of AI tools only makes this clearer: AI can generate text, but only a designer can generate strategy, empathy, and safety. When you view every word as a key design element, you move past simple writing and actually create the user’s experience.</p><p>For any designer who feels writing is just an extra task, this article shares a framework. It treats language as a core design function and the essential tool for building products that are usable, useful, and responsible.</p><h3><strong>Writing vs. Designing</strong></h3><p>When approaching a piece of content, most people immediately ask: <em>“How should those words be written?”</em> This is a tough place to start. Before you write anything, you must first think about designing the experience you want your users to have.</p><p>This is the key difference between the two mindsets:</p><ul><li>Writing Mindset asks: <em>How many words will fit here? How should I describe this action?</em></li><li>Design Mindset asks: <em>What problem are we solving? What terms are our users familiar with? What happens next?</em></li></ul><p>Writing is about fitting words together. Designing is about solving problems for your users. You cannot have one without the other; they must work together.</p><p>As Nicole Fenton, coauthor of <em>Nicely Said</em>, puts it: “<em>I use language to solve problems… I use words as material [1].</em>”</p><p>Your words build digital experiences. You are designing interfaces that allow people to pay bills, send emails, or order food. Every word included in those experiences directly shapes the user’s understanding, feeling, and outcome.</p><h3><strong>The usable useful responsible (UUR) framework</strong></h3><p>Designing with words is more than just arranging letters into sentences. To be truly effective, you have to think of your work not as a writing task, but as a design mandate. It demands skills far beyond basic writing.</p><figure><img alt=""The Usable, Useful, Responsible Framework text is shown above a large, yellow, four-stud building block (like a LEGO brick). The brick symbolizes the foundational components of the design framework."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hxr5i39R1NYwKkafChP-_A.png"" /><figcaption>The image shows a LEGO block, symbolizing the building block of a designer’s writing: the Usable, Useful, Responsible Framework</figcaption></figure><h4>1. Usable words</h4><p>When a product is usable, people can complete their tasks without needing help or instructions. For designers, creating usability means making sure your words act as a guide. The language itself must be clear so users can quickly finish their task.</p><p>This level of clarity is critical for everyone, but especially for those with cognitive disabilities, those who are stressed, or those using screen readers. As content design expert Sarah Richards says: <strong><em>“Accessibility is usability.”</em></strong> If your words aren’t easy for everyone to use, you’ve made a design choice that prevents some people from using your product [2].</p><p>Consider a simple login screen on a mobile app. The way the error message is written determines if the user can easily proceed:</p><ul><li><strong>Unusable writing (Poor design)</strong></li></ul><p>Login failed (<em>User is confused; they must guess if the email, password, or registration is the problem.</em>) (<em>User is offered no path forward.</em>)</p><ul><li><strong>Usable writing (<em>Good design</em>)</strong></li></ul><p>Email not registered. Sign up or check for typos. (<em>User knows exactly what is wrong: their account doesn’t exist.</em>) (<em>User is offered a clear, actionable solution: register or correct their mistake.</em>)</p><figure><img alt=""A comparison of two mobile login screens. The screen on the left shows an unclear error: “Login failed.” The screen on the right shows a clear, useful error message under the email field: “Email not registered. Sign up or check for typos.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6ZDivlMQGmS3DVHnwJ5MPg.png"" /><figcaption>A comparison between two different ways a login screen handles an error, illustrating the difference between unuseful and useful feedback.</figcaption></figure><p>This demonstrates how usable writing guides the user by providing clarity (<em>what went wrong</em>) and actionability (<em>what to do next</em>).</p><h4>2. Useful words</h4><p>For your words to be useful, you need to understand and honor your users’ intent. Useful writing gives people control and prioritizes their needs, balancing them with business goals. When you respect users, they are motivated to keep giving you their time and attention.</p><p>For example, when a user intends to delete an account, useful writing must provide a clear path to complete that goal. A design that makes this process intentionally difficult through deceptive language is a classic example of making a product unuseful.</p><p><strong>Unuseful writing (User-hostile design)</strong></p><blockquote>“Hold On! Are You Sure You Want to Deactivate Your Profile and Lose Your Benefits?”</blockquote><p>Uses emotionally charged language, focusing on loss, to dissuade the user from their clear intent. Buttons: Cancel (Prominently styled, primary color) and Deactivate Later (Small, secondary color).</p><p>The issue here is it offers “Deactivate” instead of “Delete” to mislead the user into thinking the account is merely paused, retaining their data for marketing.)</p><p><strong>Useful writing (User-first design)</strong></p><blockquote>“Permanently Delete Your Account?”</blockquote><p>This is direct, unambiguous question honoring the user’s intent. Buttons: Yes, Delete Account (Clear, destructive) and Cancel (Neutral color).</p><p>It gives the user the necessary control and confirms the final, irreversible action.</p><figure><img alt=""A comparison of two account closure screens. The screen on the left, marked with an ‘X’, uses a dark pattern by asking the user to “Deactivate later,” making it difficult to find the option to permanently delete the account. The screen on the right, marked with a checkmark, has a clear title, “Permanently delete your account,” and a prominent red “Yes, Delete account” button."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*S6Kz54gsU90EUmzkt16HEA.png"" /><figcaption>A side-by-side comparison of user interfaces for closing an account, demonstrating good and bad design.</figcaption></figure><p>Useful writing focuses on what people want from your product or service and asks how you can balance that with business goals, rather than focusing purely on what the business can get out of it.</p><h4>3. Responsible words</h4><p>As a designer, you are responsible for what you put into the world. To write responsibly, you have to consider how your words could be used and, crucially, misused.</p><p>Irresponsible writing often weaponizes language. A popular example is “confirm-shaming,” where an interface asks a user for something (like an email) and then forces them to say or think something negative about themselves to decline.</p><figure><img alt=""Website footer featuring a newsletter subscription box that employs Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) text to pressure users into signing up to avoid “paying more” or missing “insider knowledge.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*542HwlftSE_p38Y_YDOlOw.png"" /><figcaption>A footer dark pattern example using fear of missing out (FOMO) and implied punishment (“paying more”) to pressure users into subscribing.</figcaption></figure><p>For instance, in a static footer that asks for an email:</p><ul><li>The headline creates anxiety: <strong><em>“Don’t be the last to know!”</em></strong></li><li>The subtext acts as the shaming mechanism: <strong><em>“If you’re okay with missing out on essential insider knowledge and paying more, just scroll on by.”</em></strong> This forces the user to internally validate that they are “okay with missing out” and “paying more” in order to ignore the field, making the act of declining feel like a financial or intellectual failure.</li></ul><p>As a designer, it’s your responsibility to consider not just how your writing will be used, but also how it could be misused, whether by an algorithm, others in your company, or malicious people. You must ask: <strong>Are they true? Are they kind? Are they inclusive?</strong></p><h3>Aligning your team before you write</h3><p>I’ve spent time with my team and stakeholders debating word choice. For example, should a button say “Buy” or “Purchase”? Stakeholders often look for a “best practice” answer: what does Amazon do? But asking this question is frustrating and distracts from the real issue.</p><figure><img alt=""A side-by-side comparison of two identical product cards for Wireless Headphones priced at ₦45,000. The card on the left uses a clear black button labeled “Buy.” The card on the right uses a black button labeled “Purchase”."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rm4pzevukAWkAjP4zpHePg.png"" /><figcaption>A visual comparison of product card buttons: one uses the clear, direct label “<strong>Buy</strong>,” while the other uses the more verbose label “<strong>Purchase</strong>.”</figcaption></figure><p>The right answer isn’t about being right or wrong. It’s about what works for your users and what your team needs to achieve. Before you can choose “Buy” or “Purchase,” you need a clear strategy.</p><blockquote>Strategy simply means getting everyone aligned on a shared focus. It tells the team what to do, and what to ignore.</blockquote><p>A simple strategy statement connects four key elements:</p><ol><li>User Type</li><li>User Need</li><li>Value Provided</li><li>Business Benefit</li></ol><p>For example:</p><blockquote><em>“</em>We help budget-conscious buyers easily acquire high-quality audio gear so they can enjoy superior sound immediately, which supports AudioFlow’s goal of increasing first-time conversions and positive word-of-mouth.”</blockquote><p>This statement immediately provides direction. Since the goal is easy acquisition for a wide, budget-conscious audience, choosing the clearest, most conversational word “Buy” over the more formal “Purchase” is the right strategic move.</p><h3>A framework for writing with AI</h3><p>The fundamentals of good writing are clarity, concision, and empathy, and they remain essential even with AI tools. While AI can draft text very quickly, its output often lacks soul. What makes UX writing truly effective is your ability to go beyond that basic text by understanding the user’s context, establishing a consistent brand voice, and skillfully modulating the tone.</p><figure><img alt=""A dark-themed AI chat interface with the text, “What are you working on?” and an input field labeled “+ Ask anything.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iFCaD0VnkoHsOfo6poGUtQ.png"" /><figcaption>The image displays a minimal, dark-themed AI chat interface</figcaption></figure><p>To integrate AI responsibly without compromising your voice, ethics, or craft, adopt a mindset where AI is a co-pilot used for generating options, while you the designer remain the pilot responsible for strategy and empathy.</p><p>Use this three-step strategic filter to integrate AI outputs into your workflow:</p><h4>1. Prompt with strategy</h4><p>Your input to the AI must be dictated by your established voice and tone documentation, not just your immediate need. Instead of a simple request like “<em>Write an error message</em>,” let your prompt provide a clear strategy like:</p><blockquote>“Write a toast notification message for a mobile app. The user just clicked an expired password reset link. Use a confident, empathetic, and direct tone. The message must tell them to request a new link, and it must be concise.”</blockquote><p>This single prompt bundles the following elements:</p><ul><li><strong>Voice &amp; Tone:</strong> “confident, empathetic, and direct tone”</li><li><strong>Constraint:</strong> “toast notification message for a mobile app,” must “be concise,” and must tell them to “request a new link.”</li></ul><p>The resulting AI output, <strong>“</strong><em>Your link has expired. Please request a new link to continue</em><strong>,”</strong> is a direct result of these layered instructions, showing how strategic input creates high-quality, on-brand UX copy right away.</p><figure><img alt=""An AI prompt and response about writing a confident and empathetic toast notification for an expired password reset link. The suggested text is: “Oops! This password reset link has expired. Please request a new one to continue.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*iR2uvwZpb93L_owDW2X_uA.png"" /><figcaption>A screenshot displays an AI prompt asking for a concise toast notification about an expired password link, instructing the AI to use a confident, empathetic, and direct tone.</figcaption></figure><h4>2. Filter for empathy (Review)</h4><p>The first and most critical step when reviewing AI output is to filter for the human element and inclusivity. AI outputs often rely on aggregated data that can perpetuate bias, use idioms, or assume an emotional state.</p><ul><li><strong>Check for Exclusion:</strong> Does the output use any terminology (gendered, ableist, or overly colloquial) that might alienate a specific population?</li><li><strong>Check for Assumption:</strong> Does the message assume the user is happy, smart, or calm? (e.g., avoid “Great job!” or “Finally!”)</li><li><strong>Check for Idioms:</strong> Is the language literal and ready for translation, or does it rely on cultural shorthand that an international user or machine translator would miss?</li></ul><figure><img alt=""An example of an AI simplifying an idiomatic English text for better translatability and clarity. The rewritten text is: “Thank you for signing up! You can now access all our features. We will guide you through how to use them quickly.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/933/1*8P0Dvi1e_uwQTQcPgm_3ZQ.png"" /><figcaption>The image displays an example of an AI being instructed to refine copy for translatability and clarity</figcaption></figure><h4>3. Edit for core principles (Output)</h4><p>After the output passes the empathy filter, focus on refining the language to ensure it is clear, concise, and authentically human.</p><ul><li><strong>Clear:</strong> Edit for ambiguity. Ensure the language precisely describes the action and the object. For example, does the button label “Save” mean “Save All” or “Save this section”? This clarity is paramount.</li><li><strong>Concise:</strong> Cut out extra words<strong>.</strong> Look at what the AI wrote and remove anything you don’t need, like long, overly nice phrases or confusing descriptions. These just slow the user down. Your main goal is to get to the point quickly so the user can finish their task fast and easily.</li><li><strong>Human:</strong> Finally, edit for rhythm by reading the final output aloud to check for natural cadence. Does the writing sound like a robot, or does it flow naturally with appropriate contractions and pacing? The human ear is the ultimate tool for catching stilted or forced language, ensuring the final tone is authentic and engaging.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""An example of an AI successfully applying UX writing principles (Clear, Concise, Human) to rewrite a long, passive sentence into the direct call-to-action: “Click the button below to save your work and keep your changes.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/841/1*wyYZ2s8cL7KKXuCCI19ZzQ.png"" /><figcaption>The image shows a conversation with an AI where the user is successfully using UX writing principles to edit a draft text</figcaption></figure><p>By following this three-step framework of strategic prompting, empathy filtering, and editing for clarity, concision, and human tone, you can use AI to create high-quality UX copy without losing your voice or affecting the user experience.</p><h3>Designing error messages that help users</h3><p>Error messages are often the most visible things we write, and they appear exactly when users are stressed and confused. While the best error is one that never happens, we must treat any error as a chance to help people finish their work.</p><p>When people use a product, they are focused on completing a task, not on figuring out how the app works. Running into an error is a hard stop to their goal. Instead of assuming the user is doing something “wrong,” your job is to design a better experience. <em>As expert Kathy Sierra says, focus on helping your users become “more skillful, more powerful users [3].”</em></p><h4>The problem with generic errors</h4><p>Companies often blame the user for errors as a way to protect their own image. However, error messages that quietly point the finger at the user and make them feel bad actually harm the brand, causing people to stop using the product and decreasing loyalty.</p><p>When the real problem is a technology or design failure, you should be honest. For example, the email service Mailchimp uses its distinct brand voice to be apologetic, transparent, and helpful when an error occurs. This approach shows they’re committed to guiding the user forward, not blocking them.</p><figure><img alt=""An example of transparent customer service communication from Mailchimp Support, acknowledging a server outage and setting expectations for a multi-hour resolution time."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/426/1*uVDnV1xXKW2ACp25PicWdw.png"" /><figcaption>The image displays an example of effective, honest error communication, characteristic of a user-first approach.</figcaption></figure><p>If something goes wrong, do everything you can to make sure your users aren’t taking the blame. Focus on helping them achieve their goal.</p><h4>The designer’s error framework</h4><p>To guide users through or around failures, you must design your language using three principles:</p><ul><li><strong>Avoid:</strong> The best error message is the one the user never sees. Use visual design and interaction (like autocomplete or automatic formatting) to prevent the error from happening in the first place.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Mobile address search interface showing real-time autocomplete suggestions to help the user find and select a location and avoid typing errors."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Aq6tX3Ha-83mo9V5ho_Vgw.png"" /><figcaption>The image shows an example of the avoid principle in the error framework, using interactions like autocomplete to prevent data entry errors</figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Explain:</strong> When an error occurs, clearly and quickly tell the user what went wrong and why (e.g., “Your return date must be after your departure date”). Never leave the user guessing.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Mobile travel booking form showing a date validation error. The return date is incorrectly set before the departure date, and an explicit error message explains the required date order to the user."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rHwhSDosSBAzaOZfIyT6SQ.png"" /><figcaption>The image shows a mobile screen for a travel booking app demonstrating the explain principle of the error framework.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Resolve:</strong> Easily the most critical component.

Can you handle what's about to happen in the next few hours? Probably. But can you handle it on your <em>own? </em>Probably not. At least not when it comes to the<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/best-horror-movies""> scariest movies</a> of all time.<br /><br />In our opinion, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/09/11534610/angelica-ross-emma-roberts-black-trans-women-hollywood"">horror movies</a> are best consumed as a group activity. Go to the theaters in packs. Jolt at <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-horror-films-movies-shows"">the jump scares</a>. Emerge with your heart beating a <em>bit </em>too fast. Pretend, for a while, that you won't have to face the darkness alone. Inevitably, of course, you will. At some point after the movie, you'll separate from your friends and find yourself alone in your bedroom to sleep. Scenes from the movie might nip at your memory, reminding you of its<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/01/11255896/m3gan-movie-fashion-costume-design""> creepiest moments</a> and that the horrors might just exist outside of the movie theater, too. That's when the fun of the horror movie <em>really</em> begins.<br /><br />So, if you’re looking for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/04/147031/best-netflix-horror-movies"">a spooky flick to watch</a> with friends and then keep you up all night, here are our picks for the 30 scariest movies ever — if you dare.<figure><figcaption><h2><em>Sinners (2025)</em></h2>From Ryan Coogler (the visionary behind <em>Black Panther </em>and <em>Creed</em>) and starring Michael B. Jordan, <em>Sinners</em> is about twin brothers Smoke and Stack (bth played by Jordan) who are trying to leave their troubled lives behind by returning to their hometown, but they discover that an even greater evil is waiting to welcome them back. As the tagline goes: “You keep dancing with the devil, one day he’s gonna follow you home.” Also starring Wunmi Mosaku,  Hailee Steinfeld, Jack O’Connell, Jayme Lawson, Omar Benson Miller and Delroy Lindo. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Weapons (2025)</em></h2>Written and directed by <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1199107/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Zach Cregger</a>, <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/08/11926872/weapons-movie-julia-garner-review-spoilers"">Weapons</a></em> focuses on the disappearance of nearly an entire classroom except for one boy, Alex (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9816029/?ref_=fn_all_nme_1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cary Christopher</a>). When parents review the security footage in their homes, they realize that all of the missing kids woke up and ran out the door into the darkness at 2:17am on the same night. With a community searching for answers, fingers point to their teacher Justine (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/juliagarnerofficial/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Julia Garner</a>) as the culprit responsible for a mystery local police can’t even begin to solve. And as you watch, you’ll be searching for answers, too. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Nosferatu</em></h2>A Dracula tale, Robert Eggers’ <em>Nosferatu</em> is tackles the age-old story of an obsession between a haunted young woman (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lilyrose_depp/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lily-Rose Depp)</a> and the terrifying vampire (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/billskarsgard_/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bill Skarsgård</a>) infatuated with her. As it does, horror unfolds.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Fresh (2022)</em></h2>Like most good horror movies, <em>Fresh</em> starts like a fairytale: a woman named Noa (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/where-the-crawdads-sing-movie-interview"">Daisy Edgar Jones</a>) quitting dating apps and subsequently meets the supposedly perfect man, Steve (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2021/04/10427343/sebastian-stan-denise-gough-sex-scenes-monday-movie-interview"">Sebastian Stan</a>). When she accepts his invitation to a romantic weekend getaway, she finds out their love story isn't the happily ever after she was hoping for: her new man has been hiding some, ahem, unusual appetites.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Longlegs</em> (2024)<br /></h2><br />A little bit goofy and a whole lot of scary, <em>Longlegs</em> follows FBI agent Lee Harker (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2140860/"">Maika Monroe</a>) as she takes on the trials and tribulations of an unsolved serial killer case. Things take a twisted turn when she encounters a connection to the killer and has to race against time (almost as fast as your beating heart) before he mercilessly claims another family as victims.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Talk To Me </em>(2023) </h2><br />Perhaps the best horror movie to come out of Australia since <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2321549/""><em>The Babadook</em></a><em> </em>(more on that one later), <em>Talk To Me </em>combines A24 film style with a skin-crawlingly twisted story. The premise is that a group of childhood friends discover an embalmed hand that lets them communicate with spirits, which they then turn into a thrilling party game. However, things take a dark turn when the high-stakes game goes too far.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Witch </em>(2015)</h2><br />The debut film by now-notable horror director <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3211470/"">Robert Eggers</a>, <em>The Witch</em> tells the story of a family in 1600s New England whose youngest son suddenly disappears. Since the eldest daughter, Thomasin (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-anya-taylor-joy-movies-tv-shows"">Anya Taylor-Joy</a>), was the last person with the baby, the family blames her and suspicions<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/modern-witch-tarot-deck-reviews""> of witchcraft</a> begin to swirl. Slowly, paranoia ensues and the family unravels.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Midsommar</em> (2019)</h2><br />From the horror genius mind of Ari Aster, <em>Midsommar</em> follows the story of Dani (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/09/11108027/florence-pugh-makeup-venice-film-festival"">Florence Pugh</a>) as she journeys to a rural village in Sweden with her boyfriend and his friends. What starts off as a picturesque trip to take part in a midsummer festival turns into a freaky hellscape run by a violent cult. Perhaps the most unsettling part of this movie is the mix of the sunny, idyllic setting with truly terrifying, dark scenes.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Rosemary’s Baby</em> (1968)</h2><br /><br />Rosemary (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001201/"">Mia Farrow</a>), a pregnant newlywed living in a Manhattan brownstone, has a feeling that something isn't right with her baby — or with her neighbors. Though she's told not to take those suspicions seriously by the more ""rational"" people in her life, aka her husband (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001023/"">John Cassavetes</a>), Rosemary should listen to her gut, call her mom, and get out of that apartment. Alas. Instead, she's impregnated by the devil, and her baby is to be used in a Satanic ritual. <em>Rosemary's Baby </em>conjures up an unforgettable atmosphere of second-guessing that bleeds into outright fear.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Psycho</em> (1960)</h2><br />After stealing money from her boss, Marion Crane (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001463/"">Janet Leigh</a>) leaves town. After a day of traveling, she seeks refuge in a decrepit motel — but danger she encounters at this hotel is far worse than law enforcement. Marion never could've guessed the secrets the hotel's innocuous-seeming manager, Norman Bates (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000578/"">Anthony Perkins</a>), was hiding. <em>Psycho </em>manages to be one of the scariest movies ever without <em>any </em>gore whatsoever. Instead, the movie will make you question where all of your casual decisions might be leading you.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Don't Look Now</em> (1973)</h2><br />John Baxter (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000661/"">Donald Sutherland</a>) and his wife Laura (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001046/"">Julie Christie</a>) are devastated when their daughter dies. In the aftermath, John takes a job restoring a church in Venice. There, they meet two strange old women who claim to see their daughter. <em>Don't Look Now </em>is a stunning work of psychological horror adapted from a story by Daphne du Maurier, the author of <em>Rebecca</em>. It's light on gore but big on scares.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Hush</em> (2016) </h2><em>Hush </em>is a creative entry into the horror genre. The movie follows an intense cat-and-mouse game between a stalker and his unwilling victim. Maddie (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2318089/"">Kate Siegel</a>) is a deaf author who lives alone. <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0302330/"">John Gallagher Jr.</a> is the masked killer who thinks she's going to be an easy target. He's wrong.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Exorcist </em>(1973)</h2><br />Good luck getting Regan's (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000304/"">Linda Blair</a>) ravings out of your mind after seeing <em>The Exorcist</em>. Over the course of this horror classic, Regan goes from being a sweet elementary-schooler to a foul-mouth demon. And no, puberty isn't to blame. The devil is.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>28 Days Later </em>(2002)</h2><br />What would<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/01/11257325/the-last-of-us-hbo-premiere-everything-to-know""> the zombie apocalypse</a> actually look like? How would it reshape the world? After a virus contaminates the population, civilization quickly crumbles. <em>28 Days Later </em>is a movie about the flimsiness of our institutions, and how susceptible we are to something like the rage virus. Oh, and it stars a young <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0614165/"">Cillian Murphy</a>.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>It Follows </em>(2014)</h2><br /><br />So many horror movies are structured around the idea that <em>something </em>is coming for the main characters. <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/"">In <em>Alien</em>,</a> it's the xenomorph. In <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087800/""><em>A</em> <em>Nightmare on Elm Street</em></a>, it's Freddy Krueger. <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3235888/""><em>It Follows</em></a><em> </em>cleverly updates the tropes seen in these movies. After Jay (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2140860/"">Maika Monroe</a>) sleeps with her boyfriend Hugh (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1621032/"">Jake Weary</a>) for the first time, she contracts a terrible STD: Death is following her, until she passes it on to someone else. If it kills Jay, it kills everyone who came before her, too.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Omen </em>(1976)</h2><br />Ever babysit a kid and just<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/10/11159487/black-latina-ghost-hunters""> get the shivers</a>? <em>The Omen</em> will confirm that, indeed, some children are just bad eggs — and of that set, Damien (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0827032/"">Harvey Spencer Stephens</a>) is the baddest egg of all. After Katherine (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001665/"">Lee Remick</a>) gives birth to a stillborn baby boy, her husband Robert (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000060/"">Gregory Peck</a>) and doctor conspire to replace him with an orphan — and not tell Katherine. Soon, everyone around baby Damien starts dying. That’s right: Robert may have accidentally adopted the antichrist.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> (1974)</h2><br /><br />What begins as a road trip turns into a nightmare after Sally (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0122782/"">Marilyn Burns</a>), her brother, and two of their friends encounter a group of outcasts living in a barn — one of whom is a serial killer. In this movie, you can catch Leatherface at the beginning of his long franchise life. Horrifyingly, <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> is based on the true story of Ed Gein, who made masks from the skins of his victims.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Conjuring </em>(2013)</h2><br /><br />Taking place in Rhode Island in the ‘70s, <em>The Conjuring</em> details the events of real-life paranormal investigators and demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren as they are called upon to investigate a family being terrorized in their new<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/10/126422/haunted-houses-vacation-rentals""> haunted house</a>. Plus, this movie is a gateway into the entire <em>Conjuring </em>film universe, which includes <em>Annabelle</em>, <em>The Nun</em> and <em>The Conjuring</em> sequels, all of which are based on the Warrens' supposed exploits.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Hereditary</em> (2018)</h2><br /><br />If only a movie could come with a seatbelt. In the case of <em>Hereditary</em>, we’d want one. The movie begins with the death of the Graham family matriarch. As the family grieves, they’re haunted by a malevolent presence. Get ready for a jolting, shocking ride. This is the aforementioned Ari Aster’s first film — and it will certainly keep you up at night.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Carrie</em> (1976)</h2><br /><br /><em>Carrie </em>takes the inherent horrors of high school seriously. For Carrie (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000651/"">Sissy Spacek</a>), high school is a waking nightmare. She’s relentlessly bullied at school. At home, her uber-religious mother punishes her constantly. Carrie’s head is a swirling mess of repression. Eventually, she finds release at the high school prom, where she’s christened Prom Queen in an outpouring of pig’s blood. The movie culminates in one of the most memorable, horrifying climaxes in cinematic history.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Halloween</em> (1978)</h2><br /><br />The original <em>Halloween</em>, released 50 years ago, is a stalwart in the slasher genre. Michael Myers, recently freed from a mental institution, runs amok in the town of Haddonfield, IL targeting teenagers especially. Laurie (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000130/"">Jamie Lee Curtis</a>) is a babysitter who manages to outsmart (or maybe just outrun) him. Watch it so you can have a whole <em>Halloween</em> marathon that includes the final entry from 2022 in the recent reboot trilogy, which takes place when Laurie is older, waiting for the return of her tormentor. The final girl lives on.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Alien</em> (1979)</h2><br />The game: survival. The players: the hapless human crew of the spaceship Nostromo and the xenomorph, a slimy alien with rows of fangs for teeth. <em>Alien </em>is a gore-fest, reminding us that death could (literally) be around any corner. The movie also introduced one of the most iconic woman heroes and final girls of all time: Ellen Ripley (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000244/"">Sigourney Weaver</a>).<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Shining</em> (1980)</h2><br /><br />Where art house cinema meets horror meets psychological thriller, that’s where you’ll find <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000040/"">Stanley Kubrick’s</a> <em>The Shining. </em>Writer Jack Torrance (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000197/"">Jack Nicholson</a>) relocates his wife Wendy (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001167/"">Shelley Duvall</a>) and his psychic son, Danny (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0515950/"">Danny Lloyd</a>), to Colorado’s Overlook Hotel for the winter. They think they’re alone, but they're not. Ghosts populate the Overlook Hotel. And soon, so does madness.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Get Out</em> (2017)</h2><br /><a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1443502/"">Jordan Peele's</a> Oscar-nominated directorial debut is certainly scary because of the jump scares and unexpected twists. But what sets <em>Get Out </em>apart from every other horror movie is its incisive — and terrifying — commentary about race in America. Chris (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2257207/"">Daniel Kaluuya</a>) goes with his white girlfriend, Rose (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4129745/"">Alison Williams</a>), to meet her family in their upstate mansion. He can't shake the feeling that something's <em>off </em>with her family. He's incredibly right. If you like Peele’s work, then you also need to watch <em>Us</em> (2019) and<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/07/11058789/jordan-peele-nope-ending-explainer""> <em>Nope</em> (2022)</a>.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Paranormal Activity</em> (2007)</h2><br /><br />By introducing the concept of ""found footage,"" <em>The Blair Witch Project </em>reshaped the entire horror movie genre. <em>Paranormal Activity </em>brought the found footage feeling right to your living room. CCTV catches each creepy haunting that preys on the Sloat family in their new house.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em> (1984)</h2><br /><br />Sleep is where we go to retreat from the world. Except in <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em>, sleep is where you're most susceptible to Freddy Krueger (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000387/"">Robert Englund</a>), a demon who kills teenagers in their dreams — and then ensures their death in reality.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Silence Of The Lambs</em> (1991)</h2><br /><br />In <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em>, FBI investigators realize the only way they can catch the serial killer Buffalo Bill (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0505971/"">Ted Levine</a>) is by consulting someone who knows the killer mind intimately: Dr. Hannibal Lecter (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000164/"">Anthony Hopkins</a>), a convicted cannibalistic serial killer already locked up. Clarice Starling (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000149/"">Jodie Foster</a>) is forced to get close to the masked, smooth-talking Dr. Lecter who could — and does — eat a human as casually as he eats a lamb chop.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Ring</em> (1998)</h2><br /><br />Good luck staring at a TV set after watching<em> Ring</em>. The premise of this Japanese movie — which was later turned into the 2002 American movie <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298130/""><em>The Ring</em></a><em> </em>— is terrifying: Watch a cursed video tape, and have seven days to live, unless you make a copy of the tape and pass it on. In that case, you’ve cursed someone else. In<em> Ring</em>, the boundaries between<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/10/11788325/best-new-streaming-movies-tv-shows-october""> what we watch</a> and our fate is tied together inherently. Fortunately that’s not normally the case<em> </em>— otherwise fans of serial killer shows would be in trouble.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Orphanage </em>(2007)</h2><br /><br /><em>The Orphanage </em>is a thought-provoking and thrilling entry into <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/04/147031/best-netflix-horror-movies"">the horror genre</a> which will appeal to <em>all</em> movie buffs. At the start of the movie, Laura (Belén Rueda), her husband (Fernando Cayo), and adoptive son (Roger Princep) return to the orphanage where she was raised. She hopes to convert the orphanage into a home for disabled children. Instead, she stumbles upon the orphanage's dark history, which manifests in ghost form.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Babadook</em> (2014)</h2><br /><br />“If it's in a word, or it's in a look, you can't get rid of the Babadook.” So goes the rhyme which repeats, like an unforgettable motif, throughout this Australian movie. In <em>The Babadook</em>, a single mother (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0204583/"">Essie Davis</a>) and her son (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5231168/"">Noah Wiseman</a>) live together in an old house that is <em>already </em>scary — and then becomes <em>super </em>scary when a long-limbed monster called the Babadook makes his presence known. <em>The Babadook </em>is a chilling story about loss and trauma nestled inside a conventional horror movie format.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Blair Witch Project </em>(1999)</h2><br /><br /><em>The Blair Witch Project </em>could be the scariest movie on this list, simply because of how <em>real </em>it seems. Typically, while watching a<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/best-horror-movies""> horror movie</a>, you can rationalize some of the fears away by reminding yourself of its fictional nature. But that's harder to do when watching a movie like <em>Blair Witch</em>. The movie depicts three film students (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0931321/"">Michael Williams</a>, Joshua Leonard, and <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0231946/"">Heather Donohue</a>) who supposedly set forth to find the Blair Witch in 1994; the movie is the footage they left behind. When it premiered at Sundance in 1999, some viewers really did think it was a documentary.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Audition</em> (1999)</h2><br /><br />You haven't seen a<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/10/11138345/do-revenge-drea-camila-mendes-video""> revenge movie</a> until you've seen <em>Audition</em>. In this Japanese movie, a widowed film producer sets about finding a wife very methodically. He'll interview women for a nonexistent movie part. When he finds a properly submissive woman, he'll ask her out on a date. But he wasn't prepared for Asami (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0793402/"">Eihi Shiina</a>), the 28th auditionee of the day with a gruesome plan of her own.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Open Water </em>(2003)</h2><br /><br />Some might say that <em>Open Water </em>is the scariest movie on this list, but not because it’s a classic horror movie. A couple goes on a scuba diving expedition during a beach vacation. Then, the boat leaves them in the middle of the ocean. On the surface of the water, they panic and bicker. Beneath them, sharks start to circle. No movie will inspire more existential dread than this one, watching people face the inevitability of their death. On a final note: <em>Open Water </em>is based on a true story, which makes it all the more scary.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>IT </em>(2017)</h2><br /><br />Every 27 years, the children of Derry are preyed on by a shape-shifting force of evil who typically takes the form of a painted clown (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0803889/"">Bill Skarsgård</a>). The year IT comes back, a group of misfits called the Loser's Club decides to take the monster on. <em>IT </em>is set in a world in which no one can protect kids but themselves.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Suspiria </em>(2018)</h2><br /><br /><a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0345174/"">Luca Guadagnino's</a> remake of <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000783/"">Dario Argento's</a> classic horror film is a deeply unsettling tale of witchcraft, ballet, and violence. Warning: There is one particularly gruesome scene that some viewers found so repulsing they actually got physically ill. It involves a dancer's bones breaking as a dancer in a second room inadvertently controls her grotesque movements. If you’re prone to squeamishness, maybe steer clear of this movie. <br /><br /></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<p><em>Welcome to “</em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/whats-good""><em>What’s Good</em></a><em>,” a column where we break down what’s soothing, distracting, or just plain good in the streaming world with a “rooting for everybody Black” energy. This edition is all about </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3lgD59KrTw"">Hedda</a><em>, starring </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/03/11311288/tessa-thompson-creed-3-bianca-therapy""><em>Tessa Thompson</em></a><em> and directed by </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-marvels-movie-woke-backlash""><em>Nia DaCosta,</em></a><em> in theaters now and streaming on Prime Video on October 29. I also spoke to Thompson and DaCosta about the film below. </em></p>



<p><strong>What’s Good? </strong><em>Hedda</em> is good because <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2025-10-23/nia-dacosta-tessa-thompson-hedda-interview"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nia DaCosta</a> is great. And <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2019/04/230130/is-little-woods-realistic-interview-tessa-thompson"">Tessa Thompson</a> is even better. The DaCosta-directed adaptation of Henrik Ibsen’s classic play stars Thompson in the titular role as Hedda Gabler, an ambitious, repressed housewife still hung up on her prodigious ex-lover, Eileen (played by an enthralling <a href=""https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/nina-hoss-hedda-interview-1235156752/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nina Hoss</a>) and bored by her prosaic husband, George (a delightfully aloof and banal <a href=""https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a65454630/who-is-tom-bateman-daisy-ridley-husband/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tom Bateman</a>). Hedda’s disenchantment comes to a head at a dinner party where Eileen shows up with her new girlfriend, Thea (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/impoots/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Imogen Poots</a> playing frantic and overwrought perfectly), as she’s vying for the same job as George. Throw in Hedda’s other sometimes-lover Judge Roland Brack (a mischievous and menacing <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/nicholaspinnock/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nicolas Pinnock</a>) in the mix and you’ve got a night of mayhem and manipulation. </p>



<p>Set in 1950s England, as the party devolves into shambles — mostly orchestrated by Hedda herself — <em>Hedda</em> goes from a simmering conversation about what happens to a woman bound by her circumstances to a sexy psychological thriller about class, power, and ambition. As the events of the evening unfold, Hedda becomes more and more quietly unhinged and Thompson is so magnetic, oozing with charisma, that you can’t look away and you can’t help but root for one of the messiest women in cinematic history. I like to think of this column as my own Oscars. The Academy is going to deem their own “best of the best” come March 2026, and while Tessa Thompson’s name should definitely be on that ballot, in this space, I get to say what’s the best of the year and I am telling you — unequivocally — that <em>Hedda</em> is one of the best films and performances of the past year. Period. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Hedda is frustrating because even when you disagree with her choices on a fundamental level, you understand every single one of her motivations for being a manipulative, conniving, chaos monster. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>Who It’s Good For (spoilers ahead): </strong>I’m probably supposed to say that Hedda is good because it shows you a complex female character we haven’t seen onscreen before but I don’t think that’s true. We’ve seen many complex female characters onscreen — some were played by Thompson. What makes <em>Hedda</em> so great and unique is that the complex female character that we’re seeing is not only Black, she’s also queer, and she’s one of the most <em>infuriating</em> characters I’ve ever watched. Complimentary! Hedda is frustrating because even when you disagree with her choices on a fundamental level, you understand every single one of her motivations for being a manipulative, conniving, chaos monster. She does all of these things — like (spoiler!) burn Eileen’s manuscript — because she is handcuffed by the confines of her surroundings. In order to break free of those constraints, Hedda acts out and becomes an architect of destruction. The thing this movie says so boldly is not only is Hedda’s acting out OK, it’s fucking fun to watch. As Hedda blows up her own world and unravels the life she has carefully crafted while desperately trying to hold onto it, the audience is watching her fight for freedom. And that’s relatable to any woman, but it’s also liberating to watch a Black woman push to define herself, even if her methods are questionable. </p>



<p>The question at the center of <em>Hedda</em>, according to DaCosta, is “What does freedom look like?” she tells me over Zoom from New York, sitting beside Thompson. “Especially when it comes to how we represent ourselves, how we represent ourselves as Black women, is it freedom to limit ourselves to just these stereotypically positive traits, like being elegant or strong or noble? Is that freedom?” It’s not. I think true freedom for Black characters to be able to be <em>whatever they are</em> in all of their complicated, messy, frustrating, contradicting ways, just like human beings are, and just like their white counterparts so often get to be.</p>



<p>“I understand historically that we have to make sure that we’re not going to invite literal violence, by showing a negative portrayal of Blackness. I’m really empathetic to that attempt, but I also think it does limit us,” DaCosta continues. “For me, what’s been so important is seeing dynamic, human, Black women on screen in my life. I think that’s really what builds empathy, not making a small box for ourselves that we have to fit into. It was really exciting for me, but I also knew that people might get a little upset.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Over the course of my career, I’ve somehow gotten very, very lucky to play women that are complicated and interesting and aren’t always completely digestible or perfect. It’s just always been what I’ve been attracted to.</p><cite>tessa thompson</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>I didn’t find it upsetting to watch Hedda elegantly stomping around her party looking stunning (seriously, has anyone ever looked better onscreen than Thompson in this role?) and actively dismantling the lives of everyone around her. I found it fascinating. And because Thompson plays Hedda with nuance and depth, it never feels like her manipulation is simply incidental. Even when Hedda is at her absolute worst — like trying to convince Eileen to end her own life (diabolical!) — you can see that her judgement is clouded by self preservation, heartbreak, and desperation. It’s in those moments of inner turmoil where Hedda, and Thompson, shine. “Over the course of my career, I’ve somehow gotten very, very lucky to play women that are complicated and interesting and aren’t always completely digestible or perfect. It’s just always been what I’ve been attracted to,” Thompson says. “And I think the thing that felt particularly exciting about this piece is Ibsen, in the head of Gabler, wrote the prototypical first, way-ahead-of-her-time complicated, messy woman. I think what felt really exciting is to turn that on its head and to reimagine it and to repurpose it and to reconstruct it in all the beautiful ways that Nia was able to.” </p>



<p>If you’re familiar with Ibsen’s play, you’ll love <em>Hedda</em>. And if you’re not, you’ll be in awe of how timely the text still is, and you’ll — in spite of yourself — fall in love with a character who may or may not love herself and is intent on challenging everyone around her to face their own inner demons. There’s a method to her menace.</p>



<p><strong>How Good Is It? </strong><em>Hedda</em> is so good, I’ve seen it four times – twice at the <a href=""https://tiff.net/films/in-conversation-with-tessa-thompson-and-nia-dacosta"">Toronto International Film Festival</a> because I went to the premiere and hosted an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE1ZaBKR5IY"">In Conversation with Thompson and DaCosta</a>, and twice again to prep for our interview. Each time, I found something new to fixate on. The last time, I found myself connecting Hedda’s plight as a queer 1950s housewife without the freedom to live as she desires to the current <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/12/11161942/tiktok-black-tradwives-burnout-marriage-capitalism"">tradwife resurgence</a>. I ask DaCosta about the connection: “I find the tradwife thing super interesting because I can totally see that being a valid economic choice, considering the shit show that is our current climate, economy, world,” DaCosta says. “And also, you see it happen a lot where women choose to give up parts of their freedom so that they can feel safe, even though I don’t think that actually makes you safe.” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>How we represent ourselves as Black women, is it freedom to limit ourselves to just these stereotypically positive traits, like being elegant or strong or noble? Is that freedom?”</p><cite>nia dacosta</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“I think Hedda is someone who’s wrestling with that. Actually, she’s wrestling with [the thoughts that] these things make me safe, or they’re supposed to make me safe, but they’re also killing me,” DaCosta continues. “That battle is where so much of her frustration and her violence comes from, not just the violence she directs outwards, but also towards herself. But I think that’s so complicated for her to unpick and what we’re watching is someone unpick that in whatever way she can.”</p>



<p>As Hedda battles with herself, there’s a rage simmering underneath every smirk and every one of her bleak and destructive actions. Whether that rage makes Hedda suicidal is up for debate up until the final frame. When I ask Thompson about female rage, she says she was able to say so much about the topic through <em>Hedda</em>. “I think there is a tremendous amount of rage that gets started inside of us as humans full stop, but particularly related to moving through the world as a woman,” Thompson says. “I’ve spoken about my grandmothers on this press tour, because I started with them [in preparing for <em>Hedda</em>]. I started to imagine the rage that they must have felt that never got to be expressed. For my father’s mother, she immigrated to this country as a young woman of color in working spaces, managing the whole house. And her life revolved around her family, and she happily made that choice.”</p>



<p>“But I look at photographs of her before she immigrated, [she’s] free on a beach with her friends. I think there was a certain kind of freedom that she had before she came to America and was suddenly a Black American,” Thompson continues. “I just imagine all of the things that she must have felt, all of the private rage that she must have suppressed, and the same for my maternal grandmother. It felt like getting to play this character, to unleash that rage, maybe not in the kindest ways, as Hedda, but it felt like getting to exorcize that for all of the women in my life, for the woman I have been in the past that had secret, private rage at the violence sometimes that you can experience as a young girl moving through the world. It felt good to put it on screen and I hope that in some private ways, it can help people who see the film, and particularly women, to just engage with that. It doesn’t mean you need to cause harm because of it, but don’t deny that you might feel [rage]. Allow yourself the space.”</p>



<p>And that’s ultimately what Thompson and DaCosta have done: provided a space where female rage, complexity, and messiness can coexist. It’s work that I imagine would make Thompson’s grandmothers very proud. Often when we talk about artists on the margins — the ones who aren’t white or straight or male or all three — we talk about the past or about how much they still have to achieve, how excellent they have to be in order to be worthy enough to earn their place. Tessa Thompson and Nia DaCosta are already there, and more importantly, they do work that makes us look forward with hope and endless possibility. That’s how I felt watching <em>Hedda</em>.</p>



<p>Turning Henrik Ibsen’s play into a sensual Black, queer, romp for modern audiences was risky. But Thompson and DaCosta have proven time and time again that they take big swings. From blockbusters (both have dabbled in the Marvel universe, Thompson is the star of the <em>Creed</em> franchise and DaCosta is about to direct the next instalment of  the <em>28 Years Later</em> series), to daring adaptations, to small original ideas (they first collaborated on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/04/229875/little-woods-movie-review-lily-james-tessa-thompson""><em>Little Woods</em></a>), this director-actor duo do all the things we’re being told can’t exist in Hollywood anymore. And their latest collaboration is their best yet. Ultimately, <em>Hedda</em> is a stunning reimagining that painstakingly and purposefully builds towards an astonishing climax. It’s gorgeous and bold and just another entry into the canon of both DaCosta and Thompson’s work about complicated, brilliant, and infuriating women. </p>

And while rest is essential for staying in tip-top shape both mentally and physically, it’s also when your skin gets to work.</p>



<p>That’s right: When you’re enjoying your trip to snoozeland, that’s when your skin gets hard to work — which is what inspired Nocturnal’s hero serum.</p>



<p>“If you’re not getting the proper sleep your body needs, cortisol levels remain high, interfering with cellular activities like wound healing, and even skin hydration,” dermatologist Joshua Zeichner, MD, tells Refinery29. “This even can contribute to acne breakouts.” Founded by beauty industry veterans Katey Hassan and Daniel Kiyoi, Nocturnal’s <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/UBAGQESK/products/polar-night-renewal-serum"">Polar Night Renewal Serum</a> is smart, luxurious skincare in a bottle — and it’s definitely not your everyday night serum. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.linkby.com/UBAGQESK/products/polar-night-renewal-serum"">Polar Night Renewal Serum</a>, $178</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938218.jpg?width=910&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=455%3A512"" /></figure>



<p>Packed with peptides, niacinamide, oat-derived lipids, and evening primrose, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/UBAGQESK/products/polar-night-renewal-serum"">Polar Night</a> is made to brighten, hydrate, and address signs of aging. However, the most notable innovation IMO lies in a patent-pending delivery system — which actually matters so the potent ingredients you’re paying for get readily absorbed by your skin. But at the end of the day, all of the fancy technology in the world doesn’t matter if my skincare doesn’t yield results.</p>



<p>I may not have wrinkles and fine lines yet (I’m 32, but still get routinely asked if I’m still in college — a slight annoyance that I will one day love, I’m sure), so I can’t speak much to the fine line-reducing ability of Polar Night, but I will say that my overall bounciness and texture have vastly improved since incorporating this into my PM routine. (I even keep it on my nightstand to reapply right before bed.) In the morning, I wake up with soft, smooth skin that isn’t screaming for moisture.</p>



<p>And here’s the thing: Is it expensive? Yes. However, I always recommend investing in your serum or moisturizer (as opposed to cleansers) since they tend to be more concentrated in actives and stay on your skin for a longer period of time. The 30mL full size lasted me a few months with nightly use, and I just replaced it with a <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/UBAGQESK/products/polar-night-renewal-serum-refill?variant=43293817143484"">refill pod</a>. (Which, when the packaging is as gorgeous as Nocturnal’s, it genuinely makes me want to reuse it forever.) And since I’ve been using Polar Night, I’ve haven’t wanted to book a facial or invest in richer moisturizers since my skin is already happy and hydrated. Serums that work smarter <em>and </em>harder? Here for it.</p>

<p>We’re now in the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-fall-candles-2025-latine"">middle of fall</a>. The onset of Scorpio season lands in the depths of fall for the Northern Hemisphere. As we dive into the simmering waters of Scorpio, we’ll feel more connected to others because our hearts and minds will be open. We have the opportunity to realize our dreams and we will be lucky enough to be happy with the outcome. Read on to discover the spooky and sweet vibes that will be coming in the month ahead.<br /><br />As a fixed <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/water-signs-zodiac-traits-explained"">water sign</a>, Scorpio is known for devotion and loyalty. The scorpion, who will sting with their poisonous venom when hurt, is extremely intuitive and highly aware of their surroundings. Scorpios wear their hearts close to their chest and suss people out before letting them in. In the days ahead we are going to decide who and what is worth investing our energy into. Being cautious will lead to us being comfortable around the people we trust. </p>



<p>The decaying leaves dropping off the trees remind us of our own mortality. Scorpio is the sign of sex, death, taxes, and evolution and we will be monitoring our personal advancementł. This is a time to make the shifts that have been on our minds. The winds of change are having a profound effect on us. We hold the power to our success and joy. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/manifest-goals-2025-zodiac-signs"">Manifesting our goals</a> will be easier. Like the crops being picked, our visions will soon be a reality. With two retrogrades (Mercury and Jupiter) and a potent Super Full Harvest Moon, we’ll contemplate our next moves and reflect on the past. </p>



<p>The feeling to watch out for is jealousy. On October 24th, when the Sun squares Pluto, we may be consumed by the green-eyed monster. This feeling might be projected onto others, or we could be the victims of it. Scorpio energy can bring out our dark side. We need to make peace with shadowy emotions by embracing our inner child and recognizing these our feelings for what they are. We should love these parts of ourselves in an effort to temper and heal them. By using our innate strength and stamina, we can create a better state of being for ourselves. Be gentle and sympathetic to others and yourself as you float through the enigmatic waves of Scorpio season.</p>



<p>Key Astrological Dates For Scorpio Season: <br /><br /><strong>October 22nd:</strong> The Sun enters Scorpio, starting a month of transformation. Our emotions will get deep, urging us to commit.<br /><br /><strong>October 29th:</strong> Mercury moves into Sagittarius, making communication direct and upfront — no more mincing words.<br /><br /><strong>November 4th:</strong> Mars glides into Sagittarius, pushing us to chase our independence and embrace adventure. <br /><br /><strong>November 5th:</strong> The magical Super Full Moon in Taurus illuminates the sky and highlights our sensual desires.  </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939013.jpg?resize=150%2C150"" /></figure></div>



<p>Let me start by saying this: I am <em>not</em> a sports girl. Never have been. I danced as a kid, I work out, but anything that involves a ball and coordination? Count me out. So when <a href=""https://usapickleball.org/"">USA Pickleball </a>invited me to <a href=""https://www.sandals.com/south-coast/?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=104221446&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD4_U5AhxrctAUMq2uzoLE8kEywU5&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw6bfHBhDNARIsAIGsqLjkljtYkno35KSzZW5OFnvIzuxguWYbDOHKgW_w-WY_uOvjewusxnwaAqYXEALw_wcB"">Sandals South Coast</a> in Jamaica for World Pickleball Day, I was equally excited and terrified.</p>



<p>But after one week of sun, sweat, and intense fun, I get it. I finally understand why everyone’s obsessed with pickleball.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Sandals was named <a href=""https://www.sandals.com/pickleball/"">USA Pickleball’s Official All-Inclusive Resort,</a> and we were there to celebrate the partnership and test out their brand-new courts. From the moment we arrived, they rolled out the red carpet: new rackets, balls, and enough <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pickleball-gifts"">pickleball merch</a> to fill a carry-on. Jamaica is already my favorite island so getting to play my first-ever game in paradise was an unreal experience.</p>



<p>Before we jumped into games, our coach gave us a crash course in Pickleball 101. We started with the basics: how to hold the paddle, how to serve, how <em>not</em> to send the ball flying into another court (which I may or may not have done). My biggest struggle? Figuring out how hard to hit. My brain kept wanting to play tennis, I was reminded over and over: <em>no wrist flicks, no power swings, just a light tap.</em></p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939014.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>If I’m being honest, I was almost more excited about my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/08/11488863/pickleball-fashion-outfits"">pickleball fits </a>than the actual sport. On day one, I wore a cute tan set that immediately betrayed me. I had visible sweat marks all over my body and let’s just say I was no longer the girl with the cute fit on the court. I was drenched in sweat, and my cute court outfit was a distant memory. But by day two, I came back strong in a white cropped tee, white tennis skirt, bucket hat, and sunnies. Looking cute on the court was an instant confidence boost. I actually started getting the hang of it.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939015.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>By the end of the week, I was into it — like, “maybe I’ll join a pickleball league” level of into it. It’s social, easy to learn, and doesn’t leave you feeling like you just survived bootcamp. I totally get why everyone from your parents to your favorite celebs can’t stop talking about it.</p>



<p>I also have to give Sandals its flowers. I’m usually not an all-inclusive resort girl, but this trip changed my mind. Between the food, the vibes, and the fact that they have everything you need to pick up a new hobby (paddles, balls, courts, and lessons), it’s the perfect setup for both chill and play.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939016.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>I went to Jamaica thinking I’d sip cocktails by the pool and maybe try this pickleball thing once. Instead, I got my cardio in, made new friends, and found a sport I actually like. So yeah, consider me a convert.</p>



<p>If you’ve been side-eyeing the pickleball hype like I was, take this as your sign: grab a paddle, find a court, and try it for yourself. Just… don’t wear tan.<br /></p>

<p>On the first day of her first job out of college, Olandria Carthen, aka Bama Barbie, walked in and was struck with one thought: <em>I’m the only one who looks like me. </em>Not only were there no women, but there weren’t any Black folks. </p>



<p>“In that moment in time, I had to remember: Tuskegee literally prepares you for moments like this,” says the beloved reality star, model, and aspiring entrepreneur, on the latest episode of <em>Go Off, Sis</em>, in partnership with <a href=""http://target.com"">Target</a>, about how her Historically Black College and University (HBCU) experience prepared her to face the realities of working in the elevator industry — one that’s very white and very male. “I fell into a mini post-college depression. Imagine going from an all-Black classroom to being the only Black person in the office. But I feel like Tuskegee showed me how to adapt to those types of environments and how to network. I had to remind myself: Never shrink yourself in the presence of others to make them feel more empowered.” </p>



<p>Carthen never expected to find herself in sales at an elevator company (she graduated with a degree in supply chain management), but her disarming charm — plus her Tuskegee education — set her up for success. In just a short time, she was outperforming her peers, knocking out one goal after another. It’s that same charm that not only won over her significant other — Nicolas Vansteenberghe — on arguably the most-watched reality TV show program of the summer, but also fans all over the nation. </p>



<p>“When I was on that show, I knew I was representing more than just myself — I’m representing Black women as a whole. So, going on there and knowing my self-worth, my value, and  self-acceptance truly helped me navigate this space,” she says. “Knowing I have so much support from my community, or just from all women, means the world to me.”</p>



<p>Listen to the full podcast episode during which Carthen chats with Kathleen Newman-Bremang, senior content director of entertainment at Refinery29; Sandy Pierre, brand partnerships lead at Unbothered; and Claire Ateku, social producer at Unbothered about Homecoming season, how she’s handling fame, Nicolandria, and more. </p>

<p></p>



<p>Get ready to sizzle! The day before <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2024-meaning-effects"">Scorpio season</a> begins, October 21st, brings a super intense New Moon in Libra. Relationships and money are shifting and itching for evolution. The cosmos is asking us to define our aspirations and inclinations. <br /><br />The Moon’s orbit around the Earth takes nearly a month to go from New to Full. The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lunar-wellness-cycle-meaning-black-women"">lunar cycle</a> begins when the Sun, Moon, and Earth are in line with each other, with the Moon facing Earth bearing no light from the Sun. As a result, a Dark Moon happens. A New Moon occurs astrologically when the Sun and Moon form a conjunction in the same sign and degree. The union of the two is a balance of the conscious (Sun) and the unconscious (Moon). We are attaining harmony in our identity and feelings. They dance together, allowing us to find our sense of self and our purpose.<br /><br />The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/weekly-horoscope-19-october-25-2025-meaning-effects"">New Moon in Libra</a> gives us clarity on who we want to partner with and the strength of vision to cut ties with those we do not. Regardless of our chosen avenue, we are gearing up to make tough decisions regarding matters of the heart. Exciting partnerships could develop, encouraging us to lean into romantic notions. We might also consider balancing various parts of our lives to achieve harmony and peace of mind. Finances could come into play, and we should ensure we stick to a budget and do not overspend. The overall message is to embrace relationships and lifestyles that lift us and allow us to grow. Emotional safety is necessary, so tighten the foundations and build toward a better place.</p>



<p>The lunation occurs in the latest degree of Libra, the 29th, called anaretic degree. This brings a messy vibe and the need for immediate change. We might show our tempers if our patience is exhausted. Additionally, the New Moon squares Jupiter in Cancer, expanding our sentimental and passionate horizons. Although this sounds amazing on paper, we might overindulge in our desires, making it challenging for others to relate to us or vice versa. While we wish to scream our feelings from the rooftops, it may be best to subdue them as a form of energetic protection. Saturn retrograde in Pisces initiates a minor frustrations within this lunation. Basically, we should slow our roll. <br /><br />Yes, we’re in love with life — but it’s advisable not to shoot our shot too quickly. We should wait until we have100% confidence in matters. Think of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/october-2025-tarotscopes-process-release"">Fool tarot card</a>; one misstep backwards brings catastrophe. Speaking of tarot, this lunation is associated with Justice and the Two of Swords. Justice represents the Sun in Libra, and the Two of Swords correlates to the Moon in Libra. The combination of these cards is another warning against rushing in — even though Jupiter is strongarming us and making us believe that haste is a good idea. Meditate for a hot minute about what truly speaks to your spirit. The more impetuous we are, the less we listen to our intuition, and intuition is key right now. </p>



<p>This is the first moment we’ve had that pushes us to manifest — last month’s eclipses caused too much frenetic energy for us to see straight, so we paused on setting intentions. Now is the time to take a leap toward our goals and make moves to secure our bag for the future. Whether committing to a ‘ship or starting a project, be sure to center your energy on the ideas that inspire and motivate you to be the greatest version of yourself. The truth is, the only way to do fantastic work and to live up to your potential is to love what you do and who you spend your time with. It’s that simple!</p>

<p>This week begins with a wave of beauty, balance, and intention-setting as the New Moon in Libra arrives on October 21, opening up a 10-day portal to re-center and recalibrate. The New Moon is ruled by <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-libra-horoscope-october-2025-meaning-effects"">Venus, who’s just come home to Libra</a>, adding a layer of divine ease and elegance to the cosmic weather. Think of this lunation as your official invitation to simplify your life, clear emotional clutter, and call in relationships that reflect your growth, not your patterns. Even if the world feels chaotic, this is a window where the inner world can start to feel a little more in rhythm — one breath at a time. <br /><br />But don’t get too comfy, because the next day, on the 22nd, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/libra-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Libra Season</a> ends, and on the 23rd, the depths of Scorpio Season rise up to meet us. That shift alone — from Air to Water, from surface to soul, from curation to catharsis — is a reminder that life moves in layers. We’re at a threshold, a moment between what’s light and what’s heavy, and the astrology this week is here to teach us that we don’t have to pick one or the other. We can live and let live, love and let love, <em>and</em> still honor the shadows that live within us. This isn’t a week of either/or. It’s both/and. <br /><br />And here’s the plot twist: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars, Scorpio’s ancient ruler, is also in Scorpio</a>, intensifying our instincts, sharpening our focus, and stirring our deepest desires. When both Venus and Mars are in their home signs, it’s like the divine feminine and divine masculine are having a private convo about where we’re really headed. Passion meets poise, truth meets tenderness, and we’re being asked to integrate it all. The version of you who craves connection and harmony gets to co-exist with the one who’s finally ready to stop pretending and speak from the soul. </p>



<p>Also on October 22, Neptune retrogrades back into Pisces at 5:51am EST for its final visit to its home sign — a placement it’s held since July 2011. That’s 14 years of dreaming, dissolving, romanticizing, escaping, and sometimes deceiving ourselves. So let’s pause here: <em>What were you longing for in 2011 that still lingers in the background of your life today? What illusions have been too sweet to let go of? What delusions have actually protected you, and which ones are now blocking your growth?</em> Neptune’s final retrograde through Pisces is here to help us differentiate between being delulu and finding the solulu, and that lesson is as spiritual as it is sobering. <br /><br />And it’s not just personal… this retrograde affects us on a collective level, too. With Saturn also recently re-entering Pisces, and the North Node currently transiting Pisces (until 2026), there’s a massive wave of Piscean energy shaping our intuition, our ideals, and our imaginations. That means questioning media narratives, cultural myths, and the stories we’ve been spoon-fed. It means trusting your gut, even when the facts aren’t clear. And above all, it means reclaiming your spiritual sovereignty. The answers don’t always arrive through logic — sometimes they live in a poem, a dream, a flash of insight, or the moment your body relaxes for the first time in days. <br /><br />This week is about trusting the quiet truth inside you, even if you’re still figuring out how to name it. It’s okay to change your mind. It’s okay to want solitude one minute and to feel wildly social the next. Conversations will be both hilarious and profound — the kind that make you laugh until you cry and cry until you laugh again. And the more grace you offer yourself through this integration process, the more you’ll be able to offer it to others. We’re all riding this wave together. No one’s doing it perfectly. </p>



<p>So lean into the beauty. Let yourself desire peace. But don’t be afraid to feel the edges of your longing, too. Let the Libra New Moon remind you that healing doesn’t always look like shadow work — sometimes it’s a playlist, a pretty dress, a flirty glance, or the moment you decide to forgive yourself for being human. And let Scorpio Season’s arrival remind you that transformation can be tender, and it’s okay if you’re not ready to share the full story just yet. You’re allowed to evolve quietly.<br /><br />Because this week? It could all be so simple — and it gets to be. <br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>You’ve been pretending not to care, Aries, but the Libra New Moon on October 21st is calling your bluff. It’s happening in your partnership sector, and with Venus also in Libra, it’s time to admit that yes, you want softness. You want connection. You want someone who sees you and doesn’t flinch. Whether you’re in a relationship, navigating a situationship, or feeling completely solo — this lunation wants you to pause and check in: <em>What kind of love are you calling in?</em> You get to rewrite your expectations and begin again. It’s okay to let yourself want more: more harmony, more depth, more reciprocity. That doesn’t make you weak; it makes you wise.<br /><br />Then, two days later, the vibe shifts completely as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/10/10719292/scorpio-season-october-2021-meaning-effects"">Scorpio Season</a> begins on the 23rd, lighting up your sector of merging, intimacy, and long-term investments. This is about more than sex (though, yes, that too). This is about legacy. About who you’re building with. About what you’re merging your energy, resources, and soul with and why. With Mars, your ruling planet, in Scorpio, you’re operating with more instinct and intuition than usual. You’re not showing all your cards. You’re observing, planning, feeling more private, and more potent. That can feel disorienting for a Fire sign, but it’s medicine. Let your decisions simmer. Reassess how you spend your energy and who you trust with your heart, your body, your secrets. Scorpio Season is about power, not performance. </p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, your body knows. Your spirit knows. Your routines know. This week’s Libra New Moon on October 21st is like a soft reset for your wellness, work, and rhythm sector, and it’s reminding you that healing isn’t supposed to feel like punishment. It’s supposed to feel like <em>alignment</em>. That means going to bed at a decent hour, turning your phone off an hour before sleep, choosing ginger tea over scrolling, and saying “no” without guilt. With Venus, your ruling planet, also in Libra, this is your chance to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-libra-horoscope-october-2025-meaning-effects"">romanticize your wellness</a>. Make your water fancy. Play jazz while you fold clothes. Eat your snacks before 8pm. You already know what needs tweaking — this lunation just gives you permission to actually <em>do it</em>. And yes, small changes count. <br /><br />But then the tempo changes: Scorpio Season begins October 23, activating your relationship sector and inviting you into the realm of real connection. And not the Instagram kind — the deep, soul-mirroring, “why are you in my dreams” kind. With Mars also in Scorpio, your desire for depth in partnership is doubled. It’s cinematic and intense. You may find yourself magnetically pulled toward people with Scorpio placements, or just craving more <em>presence</em> from the people already in your life. But the challenge? Don’t lose yourself in the sauce. Remember your rituals. Stay rooted in your values. You don’t have to prove you’re lovable. You just have to be present. </p>

<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>This Libra New Moon on October 21st is a love letter to your inner child, Gemini. It’s a fresh start in your creativity, romance, and play sector, and it wants you to do what actually feels good. Remember hobbies? Remember flirting for fun? Remember making things just because you felt like it? That’s what this lunation is about. Venus in Libra is also holding your hand, reminding you that ease can be productive. That joy is part of your path, and that laughter heals. This week, say yes to the dance class, the art project, the silly text, the cartoon rewatch, the solo karaoke in your bathroom mirror. Give your inner child the wheel for a bit. They know the way. <br /><br />Then, once Scorpio Season begins on October 23, your energy gets more serious — but in a helpful way. Scorpio lights up your sector of wellness, habits, and systems, and Mars in Scorpio gives you the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-improve-focus"">power to focus</a>. You’re not just dabbling anymore. You’re getting your sh*t together. And yes, that might feel a little overwhelming at first — the structure, the schedule, the responsibility — but it’s so necessary. Think of this as your season of refinement. What systems do Future You need in place? What boundaries? What daily rituals? Treat discipline as a form of devotion, not restriction. You’re not doing this to limit yourself — you’re doing it to <em>free yourself</em>. </p>

<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You can’t decorate over a wound, Cancer. This week’s Libra New Moon on October 21st lands in your home, healing, and inner foundation sector, and it’s gently guiding you to tend to what’s beneath the surface. Maybe that means rearranging your room so it feels more like a sanctuary. Maybe it means having a long <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/talking-to-family-relationship-disapproval"">talk with a family member</a>. Maybe it means journaling the thoughts you usually keep hidden. This isn’t about appearances — it’s about <em>alignment</em>. With Venus also in Libra, you’re supported in creating beauty and balance where things have felt off-kilter. Let this lunation be a reset for your nervous system. You’re allowed to begin again, even if you never got the apology. Especially if you didn’t.<br /><br />Then comes the glow-up: Scorpio Season kicks off October 23, activating your sector of joy, pleasure, romance, and creativity for the next four weeks. This is your permission slip to <em>feel yourself</em>. To flirt, to play, to create. With Mars also in Scorpio, your sensuality is magnetized, but so is your creativity. You’re not just craving fun, you’re craving depth <em>within</em> fun. Art that moves you, love that consumes you, moments that feel like magic. Just don’t forget: the muse needs rest, too. Protect your energy, and your intuition. The next four weeks are about remembering what brings you back to life and refusing to settle for anything less. </p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The Libra New Moon on October 21st is a social, stimulating reset for you, Leo. It’s lighting up your communication, curiosity, and connection zone. Conversations flow easier this week, and you may find yourself reaching out to people you’ve been meaning to text back since… August. With Venus also in Libra, charm comes naturally to you (yes, even more than usual). You could be asked to collaborate, speak, teach, or write something that finally gets your ideas the attention they deserve. Say yes to anything that feels light, exciting, and reciprocal. This lunation wants you to remember that words are spells, so choose the ones that align with where you’re headed, not where you’ve been. <br /><br />Once Scorpio Season begins on October 23rd, the vibe shifts inward. Your attention turns toward your home, your emotional safety, and your sense of belonging. It’s less about how you’re <em>perceived</em> and more about how you <em>feel</em> when the lights are off and no one’s watching. With Mars also in Scorpio, family dynamics, domestic decisions, or living arrangements may need attention. But instead of reacting, try responding. Scorpio Season is about moving from pride to presence. About anchoring yourself in the small, sacred rituals that keep your heart steady. Decorate your space. Reconnect with your roots. Make home feel like peace again. </p>

<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, this week’s Libra New Moon on October 21st is whispering “stability” — not in a boring way, but in the “let’s actually feel safe in our bodies and our money again” kind of way. It lands in your finance and self-worth zone, encouraging you to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2025"">treat your energy like currency</a>. Where are you investing your time, your attention, your money, your heart? Do those investments still align with your values? With Venus also in Libra, you’re being guided to reconnect with the pleasure of abundance — not hustle for it. Maybe that looks like budgeting with grace, paying yourself first, or simply believing you’re allowed to receive without overexplaining. This lunation wants you to see yourself as the asset.<br /><br />Then, Scorpio Season begins on October 23rd, shifting your attention to your communication and learning sector. You’re not just observing anymore — you’re analyzing, processing, and saying the things that others are too scared to. With Mars in Scorpio, your words carry weight, and your intuition about people is almost eerie. Don’t use that power to overthink or prove yourself — use it to connect. Journal your thoughts. Have the difficult conversation. Take the class or trip that’s been calling to you. Your mind is a portal right now. Speak from the heart, and it’ll reach exactly who it needs to. </p>

<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>We’ve made it to <em>your</em> annual new moon week, Libra, and it’s one of the most beautiful cosmic resets of the year. On October 21st, both the Sun and Moon meet in your sign, with your ruler Venus also cozy at home in Libra. Translation? This is a full permission slip to live and let live, love and let love. You don’t have to earn peace; you can choose it. You’re not being superficial for wanting beauty or harmony — you’re remembering that those things heal you. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-zodiac-sign-2025"">Set intentions</a> that celebrate who you’re becoming rather than fixating on who you used to be. This lunation is a mirror moment. Look closely. You’ve grown more than you realize. <br /><br />By October 23rd, when the Sun slides into Scorpio, the tone deepens — and your focus turns to your values, resources, and inner self-worth. You might notice where you’ve been over-giving, or where your generosity hasn’t been matched. Don’t spiral… Just rebalance. With Mars in Scorpio, it’s time to get practical about your goals. Where do you want to build lasting stability? What’s worth your emotional bandwidth? Scorpio Season helps you refine what “abundance” really means to you. Sometimes, it’s money. Sometimes, it’s peace. This next chapter teaches you how to protect both. </p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio Season begins this week, babe! You can feel it coming, can’t you? But before we get there, the Libra New Moon on October 21st feels like the inhale before the exhale — a quiet clearing in your healing, rest, and reflection zone. You may crave solitude more than usual, and that’s not isolation… it’s preparation. With Venus also in Libra, your soul is recalibrating before the spotlight returns to you. This week’s new moon wants you to release the pressure to do everything at once. Rest is the ritual, closure is the work, and forgiveness is the reset. Give yourself the stillness your spirit’s been asking for, and watch how naturally the inspiration flows back in. <br /><br />Then, on October 23rd, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2024-meaning-effects"">it’s officially </a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2024-meaning-effects"">your</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2024-meaning-effects""> season, Scorpio</a>. The Sun enters your sign, and so does the main character energy. With Mars, your ancient ruler, also here, your magnetism skyrockets. You’re bold without trying, mysterious without forcing it, and on some level… people just <em>know</em> not to play with you right now. But with that power comes a choice: will you lead with love or control? This next four-week chapter is about mastering your intensity — not dimming it. Say what you want, own what you desire, and move like you’ve already shed what needed to go. It’s transformation season, and you’re the divine template. </p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The Libra New Moon on October 21st lands in your community and social goals sector, Sagittarius — and it’s giving “soft launch your reinvention” energy. This is the moment to remember you’re allowed to be known in new ways. You may feel drawn to refresh your brand, update your online presence, or pitch that creative idea that’s been living in your Notes app. With Venus also in Libra, friendship becomes a love language — so lean into the joy of collaboration and platonic intimacy. Whether it’s scheduling a girls’ night, finding a new creative crew, or saying “yes” to something that terrifies you <em>just a little</em>, this is a portal to deeper alignment. Don’t ghost your future self. <br /><br />By October 23rd, when Scorpio Season begins, your mood turns reflective. This is your annual “soul sabbatical” — when the Sun illuminates your closure, subconscious, and healing zone. You may feel more sensitive or sleepy than usual, especially with Mars in Scorpio intensifying your dreams and instincts. Use this time to untangle what you’ve been carrying that isn’t yours. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/casual-relationship-rules-boundaries"">Set boundaries with the energy drainers</a>. Tend to your inner world like it’s your most sacred altar. The magic of this season isn’t loud — it’s hidden, behind-the-scenes, preparing you to rise again in late November. For now, rest <em>is</em> productivity. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The Libra New Moon on October 21st is blessing your career and visibility sector, Capricorn, and it’s your cosmic cue to step into the spotlight — but on your own terms. What do you <em>really</em> want to be known for? Who do you feel called to become? This lunation, with Venus also in Libra, helps you approach your ambition from a place of harmony and alignment, rather than grind and guilt. Pitch the bold idea, apply for the role, speak up in the meeting. It’s not about proving anything — it’s about <em>remembering</em> what you bring to the table. You’re building a legacy. Let this new moon reflect that.<br /><br />When the Sun enters Scorpio on October 23rd, the energy pivots toward your friendships, networks, and long-term dreams. Suddenly <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dating-relationship-connection-vs-compatibility"">you’re craving connection</a> — but not the surface-level kind. With Mars also in Scorpio, you’re being guided to deepen your bonds or lovingly release what’s no longer aligned. This season helps you call in your soul tribe — the people who see your power and remind you of your softness. Whether you’re building something new, joining a cause, or just having a long-overdue heart-to-heart with a friend, Scorpio Season is your reminder: success is sweeter when it’s shared. </p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, the Libra New Moon on October 21st arrives with lightness and lift — activating your exploration, truth, and belief sector. It wants you to zoom out. To remember that life isn’t only about responsibilities and goals, but also about adventure, serendipity, and soul expansion. This is a beautiful week to plan a trip, take a course, or follow a philosophical rabbit hole that intrigues you. With Venus also in Libra, you might even fall for someone with a different background or worldview. This lunation is about freedom. Say yes to what expands your heart, and say no to what keeps you small. <br /><br />Once Scorpio Season kicks off on October 23rd, your focus shifts to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/career-horoscope-2025"">your career, reputation, and long-term impact</a>. With Mars in Scorpio, your drive to succeed sharpens, but so does your tendency to burn out if you’re not being honest about what success <em>means</em> to you. Scorpio Season asks you to build more than just your resume. It asks you to build trust. Build truth. Build something that won’t crumble when things get hard. Keep your vision, but let go of the masks. The real you? That’s the version the world’s been waiting for. </p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The Libra New Moon on October 21st is an intimate one for you, Pisces… it takes place in your sector of merging, transformation, and shared resources, which means you may be reflecting on the emotional (and financial) ties in your life. Who are you sharing your energy with, and why? This lunation, paired with Venus’ current transit in Libra, helps you navigate these waters with grace, honesty, and softness. Whether you’re deepening a relationship, releasing an entanglement, or calling in a more balanced dynamic, the message is clear: don’t settle for anything that doesn’t feel <em>sacred</em>. You’re worthy of depth that doesn’t drain you.<br /><br />By October 23rd, when the Sun enters Scorpio, the mood lifts slightly — but it also gets <em>real</em>. This is your annual call to expand, both spiritually and literally. With Mars in Scorpio, your curiosity is on fire. You’re craving truth, adventure, and deeper meaning. Whether it’s planning a spiritual retreat, writing your truth, or diving into metaphysical studies, Scorpio Season activates your philosopher mode. But it’s not about escaping. It’s about understanding the hidden patterns that guide your life. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-is-intuition-psychic-spiritual-meaning"">Let your intuition lead you</a> somewhere that pleasantly surprises you and helps you expand your possibilities. </p>
