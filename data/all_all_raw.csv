<p><em>Site: Ecological Restoration</em> - The design team and clients observed that the southern area of this volcano, supporting only sparse herb species, contrasted sharply with the lush vegetation surrounding the volcanoes. Collaborating with geologists and local herders, the team investigated the cause. The site has undergone erosion for approximately 150,000 years. The volcanic cone slumped into nine hills, now covered in soft grassland, and blended into the steppe. Located southeast of the cone, the hotel site is leeward to the northwest wind, resulting in snow and sand accumulation. Harsh soil conditions make plant growth difficult. Therefore, the hotel was deliberately sited over two-meter-deep sand pits to prevent their expansion, replace them with a new ecosystem, and restore vitality. Strategies include a snow barrier wall to retain water, protect the soil, and create a better environment for planting.</p>",

<h4>Discuss children’s preference on avatar design</h4><figure><img alt=""a white board with three quick sketches on it: doll, human face, and giraffe"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3UX4wIsuV9HFPyR68K1AnA.png"" /><figcaption>Image created by AI tool ElevenLabs</figcaption></figure><p>As a developer in a children’s hospital, I’ve designed some playful VR simulations for young patients. We try to avoid serious medical settings because there are still concerns about using VR in serious clinical contexts. Instead, we use VR in two main ways: making tedious treatments more engaging through gamification, and providing distraction during painful moments. It’s become pretty common, and it’s effective.</p><p>But when these simulations need avatars, there’s always that one question: <strong>What should they look like? </strong>An animal character? A cartoon character? Another human?</p><p>This matters more than you’d think. In VR, kids’ emotions intensify. They’re still figuring out what’s real and what’s not, so getting the details wrong can cause real confusion and discomfort.</p><p>Here’s what I learned from the research:</p><h3>Not too real, not too fake</h3><p><a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3544548.3581501"">Research </a>tested three VR avatars with kids: a human, a giraffe, and a Muppet. I thought the Muppet would win because it’s cute (well, I think so) and familiar to kids.</p><p>The giraffe won.</p><figure><img alt=""sad Elmo"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/753/1*fSqwbDbYH8_Mi8K7xic8Bg.png"" /><figcaption>Sad Elmo (<a href=""https://tenor.com/view/fairysoobs-elmo-sad-elmo-sad-stare-gif-26846922"">image source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Researchers think <strong>social realism</strong> is one reason. Social realism means how closely something matches what kids experience in real life. A human has high social realism (kids see humans daily). A giraffe has moderate social realism (it exists, but kids don’t encounter one up close). A Muppet has low social realism (it’s a fantastical TV character, not a living being).</p><figure><img alt=""Three different social realism"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*aUetvXe6GSzGacdC2MWPfQ.png"" /><figcaption>Three different social realism</figcaption></figure><p>The giraffe hit the sweet spot: real enough to be believable, special enough to be exciting. As one kid said, “I have never seen one so it’s really cool.”</p><p>The human character’s high social realism created its own problem. Because humans’ brains are so good at identifying faces, kids noticed and commented on every imperfection: “weird hair,” “big head.” They also found the eye movements unsettling.</p><p>Kids found the Muppet “weird” and “creepy” because “it’s not a real thing.” When children are still learning to separate fantasy from reality, encountering something contradictory can be unsettling. However, kids who recognized the Muppet from Sesame Street actually responded positively, which means prior exposure might help.</p><p>Still, it’s hard to predict each child’s experience with specific characters. A safe design principle is to choose something with moderate social realism. It’s clearly non-human, clearly plausible, and doesn’t trigger that uncomfortable “this shouldn’t exist” or “something’s off” feeling.</p><h3>Getting the proportions right</h3><p>Okay, so let’s say we pick a character with moderate social realism, like a fox. How should we design its appearance? Most designers are aware of uncanny valley effects and avoid hyper-realistic designs. So what if we make it cute and cartoon-like with bigger eyes and head?</p><p>Well, it turns out that kids aren’t fans of exaggerated proportions either. <a href=""https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000449027600041"">Feng’s research</a> showed that children’s preference declined as eye size enlarged. The reason is likely the same: <strong>exaggerated proportions conflict with kids’ understanding of the world.</strong> <a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2042753021994337"">Research</a> with young adults showed that a 25% eye size increase can be optimal, suggesting small tweaks might help. However, more research is needed to determine if this applies to children as well.</p><p>When designing the appearance, consistency is crucial. If you choose a cartoon style, commit fully across the entire body, not just the face. Mixing realistic bodies with cartoonish features creates the kind of mismatch that makes kids uncomfortable.</p><h3>Movement matters</h3><p>Besides appearance, many kids commented on avatars’ behaviors. Interestingly, they mentioned movement first and appearance second, showing the importance of behavioral realism.</p><p>Kids made comments about all kinds of movements, including head movements and facial expressions. But among all their observations, eyes were the most critical feature.<strong> They assessed realism mainly through eye behavior.</strong> For instance, they found avatars creepy because of “unsettling eye movement,” staring, or unnatural blinking speed. They also wanted avatars to “acknowledge their existence by making eye contact.”</p><p>However, realism alone isn’t enough. Consistency matters. A cartoon fox with hyper-realistic blinking will still feel off. Behavioral realism needs to match visual realism. Designers need to find the balance between all elements.</p><h3>Keep distance in mind</h3><p>Compared to adults, kids showed more attempts to interact with avatars. They wanted to play with them and touch them. Some expressed disappointment that avatars felt “fake” because they couldn’t physically interact with them.</p><p>Not all applications need direct avatar interaction. For experiences where interaction isn’t intended, distance design can help. Well-designed distance can improve both visual and behavioral realism. It not only prevents unwanted interactions but also keeps certain imperfect features from being too noticeable.</p><p>Distance design is relatively new compared to traditional media. On flat screens, characters maintain a certain distance from users. However, in VR, characters share the same space as kids.</p><p>In real life, people naturally keep some distance from one another. Hall’s proxemics theory (1966) explains this: people maintain different zones of personal space depending on their relationship and social context. <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10055-025-01127-y"">Studies </a>show people maintain similar distance zones in VR. When approaching others, they typically stay within social space range (1.22–3.65m), which is consistent with Hall’s theory. (1 unity unit in VR = 1 meter)</p><figure><img alt=""Hall’s proxemics theory"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dPODKM01alTqpWRGVKxvcw.png"" /><figcaption>Hall’s proxemics theory</figcaption></figure><p>However, some <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10055-024-00982-5"">studies</a> find people keep much larger distances in VR than in real life, which is around 160% farther. This might be because distance perception works differently in virtual environments.</p><p>These differences are normal. They can stem from environmental settings, age range, or users’ prior VR experience.<strong> The safest design principle is to position avatars slightly farther away and allow kids to close the gap if they want.</strong></p><p>In VR, kids’ emotions intensify because characters share the same space, making everything feel more real. This makes designing avatars trickier than it looks.</p><p>It’s not just about making something cute. We need to understand how children process reality and what triggers their “something’s wrong” feeling. Kids are still in their developmental phase, learning what’s real and what’s not.

<h4>How chatbot-first thinking makes products harder for users</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7x1tlD3qYPDu58RQ-u1veQ.png"" /></figure><p>We’ve lived with AI long enough to witness some groundbreaking changes in how we live, work, and design. But we’ve also lived with it long enough for misconceptions to emerge — before best practices have really had a chance to settle.</p><p>The pace of disruption remains wild. However, <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/state-of-ux-2026/"">2026 is already being described as the year of AI fatigue</a>.</p><p>For product leaders, this creates a new challenge: we need to define ways to approach UX for AI without making AI-powered products exhausting, inconvenient, risky, and unsustainable.</p><p>This article focuses on one of the widespread misconceptions that could send the future of UX along a very wrong trajectory. I call it <em>chatbot-first thinking</em>: the assumption that conversational interfaces can — or should — replace most existing UI patterns completely.</p><h3><strong>The Promise of Zero UI</strong></h3><p>Let’s start with the most obvious question on the surface:</p><p><strong>Is the future of user experience purely conversational?</strong></p><p>For many, it’s tempting to dream about it. Especially if you’re a frequent user of large LLM interfaces today. Especially if you follow <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/openai-aims-to-ship-its-first-device-in-2026-and-it-could-be-earbuds/"">announcements like OpenAI’s recent promise of a screen-free, pocketable product</a> that hints at a life increasingly driven by AI orchestration. And especially if your mental model of AI experience is based on the early ChatGPT experience, which was entirely conversational, with no UI snippets and micro-apps within the chat dialogue.</p><p>It’s also easy to fall into this line of thinking after watching the rise of ChatGPT apps — pulling familiar services, like OpenTable, directly into the chat dialogue (spoiler alert: you still need to visit OpenTable’s website to complete your user journey, as is the case with almost every app in the ChatGPT app directory). The idea that everything could eventually live inside a single conversational interface starts to feel not just plausible, but inevitable.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/c1daf7b9a5b088348fa7d2943f70612d/href"">https://medium.com/media/c1daf7b9a5b088348fa7d2943f70612d/href</a><p>In my personal life, as an enthusiast of AI tools, I increasingly try to experiment and outsource tasks to LLMs via text or voice. Agents from tools like ChatGPT or Claude — despite being clumsy, slow, and often struggling with all the still-non-AI-first websites — can handle a variety of scenarios, all of which I can trigger via a voice command in the chat.</p><p>But there’s only so much I can do via text, let alone voice.</p><h3>Can we always use conversational UX?</h3><p>The reality is much more complex. Many of the tasks we deal with in our personal life and at work require <strong>rich, multi-modal interaction patterns that conversational interfaces simply cannot support</strong>.</p><p>If you’re a product leader evaluating whether UX of your AI functionality should become purely conversational, I recommend thinking twice whether it will become an accelerator or a blocker for your product.</p><p>One of the good starting points is <a href=""https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversation-design/is-conversation-the-right-fit#is-conversation-the-right-fit"">Google’s checklist</a> for the conversational approach fit:</p><figure><img alt=""“Is conversation the right fit?” from Google’s Assistant / Conversation Design Guidance"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*adb9a_2AQYvfkCIsl69UtA.png"" /><figcaption>“Is conversation the right fit?” from <a href=""https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversation-design/is-conversation-the-right-fit#is-conversation-the-right-fit"">Google’s Assistant / Conversation Design Guidance</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote>When working with clients, we take this evaluation to the next level by guiding them to the interaction pattern choice via a series of validating questions, and essentially checking — does the conversational approach check all the boxes?</blockquote><h4>Question 1: Is it accessible?</h4><p>Chat-based interfaces require users to describe their problems in written text. <a href=""https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/piaac/ideuspiaac/"">Recent literacy research</a> shows that nearly half of the population in wealthy countries struggles with complex texts and won’t get good results from chatbots. <a href=""https://www.uxtigers.com/post/ai-articulation-barrier"">Jacob Nielsen called it a fundamental usability problem</a>, because it forces users to become prompt engineers just to reach the same basic level of user experience that visual interfaces previously provided.</p><figure><img alt=""Data collected by the OECD.

Countries are sorted by the percentage of their adult population within literacy levels zero through two. “Scandinavia” is the average of Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden.</figcaption></figure><h4>Question 2: Does it promote the product’s adoption and discoverability?</h4><p>Let’s imagine all of your product’s users are articulate enough. Could they still use a conversational approach for virtually everything?</p><p>Consider food ordering as an example. Major players in the AI industry like to paint a future where ordering a lunch delivery is as simple as issuing a voice command. But what if you don’t know what you want to order at all and would prefer to see the menu first? Listening to a menu, when it could be presented via graphical interface, violates one of the <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/#:~:text=6%3A%20Recognition%20Rather%20than%20Recall"">core usability principles, <em>“recognition rather than recall”</em></a> which advises <strong>minimising memory load by keeping interfaces self-evident.</strong></p><blockquote>Unlike a screen, spoken commands and outputs vanish instantly, giving users nothing to refer back to. It’s <em>“much easier to pick out the desired item from a list when the list is displayed on a monitor than when it’s read aloud,”</em> <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/voice-interfaces-assessing-the-potential/#:~:text=,feedback%20%20on%20its%20actions"">as Jacob Nielsen explains</a>.</blockquote><p>Back to our example with food ordering: how often do you actually spell out the names of your favourite food items in your head when you’re hungry? Maybe you just don’t remember the quirky name of that rice bowl you always order. Which leads us to the next issue with conversational interfaces.</p><p>Everything we put in a chat prompt is a piece of context, and the result of our collaboration with a chatbot can be only as good as the precision and relevance of our input.<strong> Therefore, prompt-based products work best for the users who already know how to ask the right question.</strong></p><p>In a purely conversational system, users often don’t know what features or commands exist, unless they actively ask or the system hints at them. Moreover, when they do discover the product capabilities and get their job done successfully via chat, how can they be sure they can still get the exact same result next time? Generative AI is probabilistic by nature, and the results may differ slightly each time. Of course, building a knowledge graph, templates, or guardrails can reduce this variation — but it can never remove it entirely. Conversational interfaces are a poor fit for high-precision tasks — unless they are heavily supported by non-conversational structure.</p><h4>Question 4: Is it reliable?</h4><p>Imagine a business user using a purely conversational assistant to update a contract term: “Change the renewal period to one year and apply the standard discount.”</p><p>That sounds clear to a human, but in practice it leaves room for interpretation. Which contract version? Which definition of “standard”? Does the discount apply immediately or at renewal? Is it one year from today or from the original start date? Small variations in phrasing — or in how the model interprets context — can lead to different outcomes each time.</p><p>In high-precision scenarios like this, users need to see exact fields, values, and constraints, review changes side by side, and explicitly confirm what will be saved. A conversational interface can help guide the process, but relying on chat alone makes the experience fragile.</p><h4>Question 5: Is it necessary?</h4><p>Just because a task <em>can</em> be done via chat, should it be done via chat?</p><p>Let’s take an example of an atomic, well-defined task that looks like a textbook success case for an AI agent: I recently needed a transcript for a YouTube video and decided to outsource the task to the ChatGPT agent.</p><p>The old way of doing it:</p><ol><li>Search for an online transcription service</li><li>Copy and paste the YouTube link</li><li>Click a call-to-action button</li><li>Download the transcript</li></ol><p>The new, agentic way of doing it (as of January 2026):</p><ol><li>Prompt ChatGPT: Get me the transcript of this YouTube video (link included)</li><li>(Optional) Observe how the agent navigates across multiple third-party transcription services, struggles with permissions, cookies, paywalls, or rate limits, retries failed requests, reformats output several times, takes minutes to complete the task but finally provides the transcript</li><li>Download the transcript</li></ol><p>If I need the transcript now, the experience quickly becomes frustrating. But it’s not just that.</p><h4>Question 6: Is it sustainable?</h4><p>The described experience raises another debate. When an LLM agent spends five minutes crawling the web, calling tools, retrying failures, reasoning through intermediate steps, it is running on energy-intensive infrastructure, contributing to real data-center load, energy usage, and CO₂ emissions. For a task that could be solved with less energy by a specialised service, this is computational overkill.</p><p>From a systems perspective, this isn’t just inefficient UX — it’s inefficient infrastructure usage. <strong>The question becomes: was AI the right tool for this task at all?</strong></p><h3>But what about agentic experiences? Won’t they remove the need for UI (and UX)?</h3><p>First, let’s explore what an AI agent is.</p><blockquote><a href=""https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-are-ai-agents"">An AI agent is a software system that autonomously pursues goals and completes tasks on behalf of a user by reasoning, planning, and acting across tools and environments with minimal human input.</a></blockquote><p>The agent’s role is to support human workflows: making information visible or drawing attention to what matters, handling parts of the workflow, exploring alternative scenarios, suggesting a best-guess next step, translating intent into actions by interfacing with APIs, coordinating signals across systems, or executing commands. <strong>The human remains the primary problem solver, with the agent augmenting and supporting — not replacing them.</strong></p><p>In line with service design thinking, agents need humans to support them across several stages of the agentic lifecycle: 1) <strong>Set up</strong> → 2) <strong>Delegate</strong> → 3) <strong>Execute</strong> → 4) <strong>Observe</strong> → 5) <strong>Intervene</strong> → 6) <strong>Confirm</strong> → 7) <strong>Complete</strong> → 8) <strong>Learn and Disengage. </strong>This system layer is called <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/human-in-the-loop"">human-in-the-loop (HITL)</a> and is intended to ensure accuracy, safety, accountability or ethical decision-making of AI workflows.</p><blockquote>Agentic experiences require a service design approach to mapping and designing of these novel, dual experiences where agents and humans collaborate to achieve results we earlier could only dream of.</blockquote><figure><img alt=""Service blueprint for human-agentic experiences"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*O6-4hKkZyanuzI-4UN1zTw.png"" /><figcaption>Service blueprint for human-agentic experiences</figcaption></figure><p>All of the described stages and touchpoints require choosing from a variety of interface approaches, beyond just the conversational one <a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2410.22370v1"">(canvas UI, contextual UI, modular UI, simulation environment, and other types)</a>. But this is a topic for a different article.</p><figure><img alt=""Various UX layouts for generative AI"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*h3gLQka9I-VzYo2rKBLe3g.png"" /><figcaption>Various <a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2410.22370v1"">UX layouts for generative AI</a></figcaption></figure><h3>The price of (not) doing UX for AI the right way</h3><p>Customer fatigue with AI slop is growing across all industries, with business initiatives like <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-ad/"">AI-generated ad campaigns triggering massive online backlash</a>.</p><p>In 2024 LinkedIn <a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/91196335/linkedin-ai-powered-prompt-questions-under-posts-feeds-premium-removed"">silently removed the shallow and unhelpful AI prompt suggestions</a> in the feed which were spotted frequently by Premium users. Meta was also <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/meta-putting-ai-front-center-apps-users-are-annoyed-rcna148857"">criticised for rolling out Meta AI as a default part of the interface in their major apps</a>, such as in the search bar or with prominent icons users can’t easily remove. Despite the user backlash, Meta is continuing to push AI features and earning the reputation of a company that is leading with AI for AI’s sake and hurting user experience rather than helping it.</p><p>On the other hand, companies that apply user-centered approach to the design of AI-powered products are enjoying success as pioneers setting new mental models.</p><p>For example, <a href=""https://news.microsoft.com/en-hk/2024/11/20/ignite-2024-why-nearly-70-of-the-fortune-500-now-use-microsoft-365-copilot/"">Microsoft 365 Copilot’s success with 70% of Fortune 500</a> companies is partially explained by their<strong><em> </em></strong>inline-style interaction pattern which has become the baseline of intuitive AI UX — the one that enhances existing workflows, not replaces them with inferior interaction patterns.</p><p>Notion AI has been one of the first companies which enabled the interaction pattern of AI suggesting contextual preset actions. This is just one example of how thoughtful selection of a UX pattern can remove the cognitive load of wondering what the AI can actually do with the text and what the best way to prompt it is.</p><figure><img alt=""Notion AI providing contextual actions to guide the user"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/580/1*XVYmQSKVS2aJfaKlYxfleg.png"" /><figcaption>Notion AI providing contextual actions to guide the user</figcaption></figure><blockquote>The future of UX for AI will not be a single interface or interaction pattern — it will be layered ecosystems of tools, touchpoints, and safeguards. As these ecosystems become more agentic, the need for thoughtful UX design only increases.</blockquote><p>This is where user-centered design and service design become essential — not as supporting roles, but as foundational disciplines. UX and service designers are uniquely equipped to map end-to-end journeys, identify moments where human judgment must remain in the loop, and design systems that clearly communicate intent, limits, confidence, and accountability. They help answer the hard questions that AI alone cannot (at least not in its pre-AGI era): <em>When should the system act? When should it pause? When should it explain itself? And when should it step aside entirely?</em></p><p>If there is one lesson we should take from the last decade of digital product design, it’s that technology rarely fails because it isn’t powerful enough. It fails because it isn’t shaped around real human needs and contexts. AI is no exception — and the cost of getting it wrong is significantly higher.</p><h4>Recommended further reading</h4><p><a href=""https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/02/designing-ai-beyond-conversational-interfaces/""><em>When Words Cannot Describe: Designing For AI Beyond Conversational Interfaces</em></a> by Maximillian Piras</p><p><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-changing-search-behaviors/?utm_source=chatgpt.com""><em>State of UX 2026: Design Deeper to Differentiate</em></a><em> </em>by Nielsen Norman Group</p><p><a href=""https://lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?2107""><em>Common AI Product Issues</em></a><em> </em>by Luke Wroblewski</p><p><a href=""https://www.uxtigers.com/post/ai-articulation-barrier""><em>The Articulation Barrier: Prompt-Driven AI UX Hurts Usability</em></a><em> </em>by Jakob Nielsen</p><p><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-paradigm/#:~:text=I%20doubt%20that%20the%20current,coughs%20up%20the%20right%20results""><em>AI: First New UI Paradigm in 60 Years</em></a> by Jakob Nielsen</p><p><a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2410.22370v1""><em>Survey of User Interface Design and Interaction Techniques in Generative AI Applications</em></a> by Reuben Luera</p><p><a href=""https://youtu.be/e3Pj7W0xl_c?si=vVhKSHDnyrbfezkp""><em>The Hidden Cost of Instant Answers</em></a> by Saleh Kayyali</p><p><a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2410.22370v1"">Survey of User Interface Design and Interaction Techniques in Generative AI Applications</a> by Reuben Luera</p><p><a href=""https://zapier.com/blog/human-in-the-loop/?utm_source=chatgpt.com""><em>Human-in-the-loop in AI workflows: HITL meaning, benefits, and practical patterns</em></a> by Juliet John</p><p><a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395298892_How_AI_Agents_Are_Reshaping_the_Internet_from_Human-Centered_to_Machine-Mediated_Commerce""><em>How AI Agents Are Reshaping the Internet from Human-Centered to Machine-Mediated Commerce</em></a> by A.

<h4><em>Vibe coding is the buzzword of the moment, and for good reason , AI tools have given product designers a massive new superpower. They have turned us all into “makers.” </em>In this article, I’ll show how I vibe coded two different projects: a floating UI cooking app and an XR basketball game.</h4><figure><img alt=""A photo of a street with a 3D hood in the middle. Two arms are in front as if were to throw a ball"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TOwitEhHrw2eRiVNjXkF2g.jpeg"" /></figure><p>While Figma put vibe coding on the map for designers, this approach goes far beyond just one tool. There is an army of incredible tools serving different purposes: design-focused tools like <a href=""https://stitch.withgoogle.com/"">Stitch</a>; prototyping engines like <a href=""https://vercel.com/"">Vercel</a>, <a href=""https://lovable.dev/"">Lovable</a>, <a href=""https://aistudio.google.com/"">Google AI Studio</a>, and production-ready environments like <a href=""https://antigravity.google/"">Antigravity </a>or <a href=""https://cursor.com/"">Cursor</a>. It’s worth mentioning that even the ones I categorize as prototyping can send its code to GitHub which add a new step towards production-ready code.</p><p>After “vibe coding” mobile and web app prototypes for a while, I realized these tools should be able to handle XR 3D canvases as well. This led to a thought… can they also prototype XR experiences?</p><p>The technology is certainly there. <a href=""https://immersiveweb.dev/"">WebXR </a>is the standard API for immersive experiences on the web, and frameworks like <a href=""https://aframe.io/"">A-Frame</a> provide ready-to-use XR components, covering inputs, primitives, teleportation, gestures and so on. Since AI coding tools can already interact with external libraries, I realized I only needed to provide the intent and guide the AI toward the spatial outcome I wanted.</p><p>So, that’s exactly what I did. And it worked. Suddenly, I could tell the AI what I wanted, and it created a 3D canvas with a head-tracked camera, hand controllers, and functional interactions. This is the beginning of spatial vibe coding!</p><h3>My approach to Spatial Vibe Coding</h3><p>In practice, vibe coding for immersive experiences is similar to vibe coding for mobile or desktop, but with an added dimension.</p><p>While you don’t need to be a developer to make functional prototypes, the more you know about the tech stack, the more control you have. Pure vibe coding , focusing solely on intent without thinking about the “how” , is valid and often the best way to avoid biasing the AI. If you give the agent freedom, it often finds the most efficient path. Conversely, if you try to micromanage it, you end up with “two brains” working against each other on the same task.</p><p>However, understanding the tools allows you to speak the same language as the AI, increasing speed and precision. For example, A-Frame has a specific component called <a href=""https://aframe.io/docs/1.7.0/components/hand-tracking-controls.html"">hand-tracking-controls</a>. If you tell the AI to use this specific component, it generates a standardized, ready-to-use solution that creates fewer problems than a custom solution.</p><p>My recommendation? Focus on intent, but establish “rules” based on the components you know work best.</p><h3>The prompting strategy: Freedom vs Bias</h3><p>When it comes to technically complex projects, I prefer to let the main AI agent figure out the solution rather than asking a <em>second</em> AI to polish or “engineer” my prompt.</p><p>In my experience, when another AI takes my rough prompt and “polishes” it, it introduces a biases. It often guides the final coding agent in a direction it wouldn’t have naturally taken, leading to worse results. I get better outcomes when I either tell the AI to refine the prompt without dictating <em>how</em> to solve it, or simply go with my original, intent-based prompt.</p><h4>The “intent-based” prompt (successful in this example)</h4><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of Figma Make environment with the preview of the UI panel"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NGyz2eAkBtUfFHL_cXmvTg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Figma Make environment</figcaption></figure><p>Here is the original prompt I created. It focused on the <em>what</em>, not the minute details of the <em>how</em>:</p><blockquote>“I want you to create an MR cooking app. The app should provide a passthrough experience with a UI panel rendered inside it. When the app is published and the URL is opened in a VR headset such as Meta Quest 2 or 3, the user should see the standard Open in VR button in the browser. After clicking it, the user can enter the experience.</blockquote><blockquote>Use WebXR and A-Frame. I will be referencing A-Frame components and primitives frequently, so make sure to use native A-Frame primitives where possible.</blockquote><blockquote>Ensure that the UI is rendered within the MR experience. Place the UI panel to the left of the user and slightly tilted toward the user’s camera. For now, include placeholder elements in the panel: a title, an image, and some text.</blockquote><blockquote>The input system should be hand tracking, using the A-Frame raycaster component. Prepare a structure to group all UI elements, as the app will include multiple screens and navigation. Build the UI using A-Frame primitives.”</blockquote><p><strong>The Result:</strong> I got a functional 3D canvas, an input system, passthrough, and a UI in place. It wasn’t polished, but it was a solid baseline for iteration.</p><h4>The “over-engineered” prompt (failed in this example)</h4><p>I then tried using an AI to “professionalize” the prompt. This version was too prescriptive:</p><blockquote>“Create a functional WebXR prototype for a Mixed Reality (MR) cooking app using the A-Frame framework.</blockquote><blockquote>1. Scene &amp; Environment Setup:<br />Initialize an &lt;a-scene&gt; configured for AR/MR passthrough. Ensure the background is transparent (&lt;a-sky&gt; removed or transparent) so the user sees the real world. Ensure the WebXR button is enabled by default so the user can click “Enter VR/AR” on Meta Quest 2/3 browsers.</blockquote><blockquote>2. Camera &amp; Input:<br />Set up a camera rig with a position of 0 1.6 0. Implement Hand Tracking controls. Add &lt;a-entity&gt; components for both left and right hands using the hand-tracking-controls component. Attach a raycaster to the hands (configured to interact with UI objects) so the user can point and pinch/select elements.</blockquote><blockquote>3. UI Architecture:<br />Create a parent &lt;a-entity&gt; to act as a “Screen Container” to group all UI elements. This will allow for easy visibility toggling for future navigation. Placement: Position this UI group to the left of the user (approx x: -1, z: -1.5) and rotate it on the Y-axis (approx rotation=”0 45 0&quot;) so it is tilted to face the user’s camera.</blockquote><blockquote>4. UI Design (A-Frame Primitives):<br />Inside the UI group, build a panel using an &lt;a-plane&gt; as the background (dark color, slight opacity). Add an &lt;a-image&gt; placeholder for a recipe title image. Add &lt;a-text&gt; for the recipe title and instruction placeholders. Ensure all UI elements are children of the parent group and are rendered properly in the MR view.”</blockquote><p><strong>The Result:</strong> This prompt guided the AI agent too much. It ended up strictly following instructions rather than finding a cohesive solution, which led to broken code. It’s like micromanaging a graphic designer, if you tell them exactly where to put every pixel, you won’t get their best work.</p><h3>Iterating on the design</h3><p>Once the foundations were defined, I decided to push the fidelity. I noticed some errors in my initial brief, specifically, trying to build complex UI with primitives. I realized it was better to design a high-fidelity UI in Figma, export it as a PNG, and import it into the experience. While tools like Figma Make struggled slightly with the point-and-pinch input system, it was enough to visualize what the production version could look like.</p><figure><img alt=""A UI panel floating in an actual kitchen"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LnDX2_CS64n6-AlK2Lyi_Q.gif"" /><figcaption>Cooking up testing in XR</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=""Hight fidelity UI of the cooking app"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qYhj6cwODYlhoYoUv8_ZVQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Cooking app UI in Figma</figcaption></figure><h3>Going further: complex interactions with Gemini 3 Pro</h3><figure><img alt=""An animated gif of a player throwing a ball into the hoop"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g4w0VTg3NNNF5M30CvYWDA.gif"" /><figcaption>Testing the game in VR</figcaption></figure><p>To push beyond UI panels, I went with Gemini Pro in Google AI Studio.</p><p>This demonstrated that a 15-minute prompting session can result in a fully functional WebXR prototype featuring physics, grabbing mechanics, and game logic.

But somewhere between a cooking hack and a clip you’ve already forgotten, forty minutes vanished. It’s all a blur. Welcome to the era of infinite content and finite attention, where our brains are working overtime just to keep up with the deluge.</p><p>Here’s the uncomfortable truth: our ability to focus is dwindling at a startling rate. <strong>According to </strong><a href=""https://gloriamark.com/attention-span/""><strong>Gloria Mark</strong></a><strong>, a professor of informatics at the University of California, the average attention span on any screen has plummeted from around two and a half minutes in 2004 to just 47 seconds in recent years.</strong> That’s not a typo. Forty-seven seconds. The median is even lower at 40 seconds, which means half of the time we’re switching our focus faster than it takes to microwave popcorn.</p><p>And in case you were wondering whether AI is helping or hindering the situation, well, the plot thickens.</p><figure><img alt=""Bar chart or timeline graphic illustrating the decline in average human attention span on screens over two decades. Three data points are shown: 150 seconds (2.5 minutes) in 2004, 75 seconds in 2012, and 47 seconds from 2018 onwards, representing a decrease of approximately 69% over the period studied."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ahnUnhiOt5daivhLYbbZUw.png"" /><figcaption>Attention spans have decreased by two-thirds since 2004, <a href=""https://www.brainscape.com/academy/top-students-increasing-attention-span/"">graph by Brainscape</a></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>The content tsunami</strong></h3><p>If you’ve ever felt like the internet is getting, shall we say, noisier, your instincts aren’t deceiving you. <a href=""https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/over-50-percent-internet-ai-slop"">Recent data from Graphite</a>, an SEO firm that analysed 65,000 English-language articles published between 2020 and 2025, found that over half of all written content on the internet is now generated by AI. Before ChatGPT launched in late 2022, that figure was hovering around 5%. Talk about an explosion.</p><p><a href=""https://ahrefs.com/blog/what-percentage-of-new-content-is-ai-generated/""><strong>A separate study from Ahrefs</strong></a><strong> painted an even more dramatic picture, finding that a staggering 74% of newly created web pages in April 2025 contained AI-generated content. </strong>Meanwhile, <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08755"">research published on arXiv</a> suggested that roughly a third to almost half of the text on active web pages now originates from AI sources. Suffice to say, we’re swimming in machine-made material, and our cognitive lifeboats are getting cramped.</p><p>The trouble is, more content doesn’t necessarily mean better content. In fact, the sheer volume creates what researchers call “attention fragmentation,” a relentless toggling between tasks, tabs, and tools that leaves us perpetually half-focused. Gloria Mark describes this phenomenon as “kinetic attention,” where our mental state becomes dynamic and restless, flitting from screen to screen like a caffeinated hummingbird.</p><h3><strong>The dopamine machine</strong></h3><p>It would be somewhat unfair to pin all of this on AI alone. Short-form video platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts have been doing a phenomenal job of hijacking our neural reward systems well before the generative AI boom. But here’s where things get interesting: AI is now supercharging these platforms’ ability to serve up hyper-personalised content at unprecedented scale.</p><p>Dr John Hutton, a pediatric neuropsychologist and director of the Reading &amp; Literacy Discovery Center at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, has <a href=""https://theweek.com/health-and-wellness/1025836/tiktok-brain-and-attention-spans"">described TikTok as a “dopamine machine.”</a> The platform delivers quick hits of novelty and pleasure with every swipe, reinforcing cravings in much the same way a tasty meal or, less pleasantly, an addictive substance might. <strong>Each scroll triggers a little burst of feel-good neurochemistry, and our brains quickly learn to want more.</strong></p><p>The neurological evidence behind this is pretty eye-opening. In 2025, <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381192500031X"">researchers at Tianjin Normal University</a> in China scanned the brains of more than 100 university students and found that those most hooked on short-form videos had noticeable differences in their brain structure. Specifically, they had more grey matter in the orbitofrontal cortex, the part of your brain that processes rewards and pleasure. The researchers suspect these students are simply more sensitive to the dopamine hits these platforms are designed to deliver, meaning they’re getting a stronger buzz from every personalised video that lands on their feed.</p><figure><img alt=""Infographic titled “Social Media’s Toll on the Mind” showing TikTok and Instagram Reels icons pointing down to a colourful brain illustration.

A red warning banner at the bottom reads “More prone to impulsive, short-term thinking.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*t7d4dJA0JxVsNSOCjsiyhw.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Meanwhile, </strong><a href=""https://www.psypost.org/large-meta-analysis-links-tiktok-and-instagram-reels-to-poorer-cognitive-and-mental-health/""><strong>a large meta-analysis</strong></a><strong> linked heavy use of TikTok and Instagram Reels to poorer cognitive and mental health outcomes, including higher levels of anxiety, depression, and, crucially, attention difficulties. </strong>Users with addiction symptoms showed decreased activity in brain regions responsible for self-reflection and risk evaluation, making them more prone to impulsive, short-term thinking.</p><h3><strong>When the brain goes on autopilot</strong></h3><p>So what exactly happens when we marinate our minds in bite-sized, algorithmically-curated content day after day? According to emerging research, the prefrontal cortex starts to feel the strain. This is our brain’s control centre for executive function, impulse restraint, and focused attention.</p><p>A <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2024.1383913/full"">2024 study by Yan and colleagues</a> found that individuals with high short-video use tendencies showed weaker executive function and poorer self-control. <strong>It’s a bit like training for a marathon by exclusively doing 10-second sprints: the sustained-focus muscle simply doesn’t get the workout it needs.</strong></p><p>But how does this translate in real life? When young people’s brains grow accustomed to the constant environmental changes delivered by an infinite scroll of 15-second clips, they may struggle to adapt to activities that don’t move quite as fast.</p><p><strong>The term “TikTok brain” has emerged to describe this pattern: impulsivity, preference for novelty, low tolerance for delayed gratification, and difficulty maintaining attention.</strong> It’s not exactly the cognitive toolkit you’d want for, say, reading a novel, sitting through a lecture, or tackling complex problems at work.</p><h3><strong>The AI amplifier effect</strong></h3><p>Here’s where AI-generated content adds a particularly spicy ingredient to this already potent cocktail. Traditional content creation had natural bottlenecks: someone had to actually write, film, or design things, which took time and effort. AI has essentially removed those constraints, enabling content to be produced at a scale and speed that would make any human creator’s head spin.</p><p>The result? <strong>An endless buffet of highly engaging, hyper-personalised material designed to capture and hold our attention. </strong>AI algorithms analyse vast amounts of user data, from search history and social media behaviour to physiological signals, crafting recommendations so compelling that stepping away feels almost painful. <a href=""https://sqmagazine.co.uk/social-media-attention-span-statistics/"">TikTok’s algorithm alone tracks over 300 data points per user </a>to tailor content within the first hour of usage, making recommendations increasingly irresistible.</p><p><strong>And here’s the kicker: some research suggests that even AI itself isn’t immune to the effects of junk content.</strong> A <a href=""https://fortune.com/2025/10/22/ai-brain-rot-junk-social-media-viral-addicting-content-tech/"">pre-print study from researchers at Texas A&amp;M, the University of Texas at Austin, and Purdue University</a> found that when large language models were trained on short, viral social media posts, they exhibited lasting cognitive decline, including increased “thought-skipping” and reduced reasoning abilities. If the machines are getting “brain rot” from low-quality content, what does that say about us?</p><figure><img alt=""Infographic titled “The 25-Minute Problem: The Cost of Cognitive Switching&quot; on a steel blue background. Three white cards show: “The Interruption” (stopwatch and brain with lightning bolts — attention switches every 47 seconds), “The Daunting Recovery” (orange header, stopwatch displaying 25 minutes to refocus, figure climbing an arrow), and “Perpetual Loop” (circular diagram of brains and stopwatches showing the endless cycle: distraction → 25 min → new distraction)."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oYMDR7MT6pwL5K7RPJFPKg.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>The 25-minute problem</strong></h3><p>Perhaps the most concerning finding from Gloria Mark’s research is what happens after we get distracted. <a href=""https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/cant-pay-attention-youre-not-alone""><strong>On average, it takes about 25 minutes</strong></a><strong> to fully refocus on the original task after an interruption.</strong> Given that we’re switching our attention every 47 seconds or so, the maths becomes rather grim. We’re essentially living in a perpetual state of cognitive switching, never quite present, never quite focused.</p><p>The consequences ripple outward. Laboratory studies consistently show that people make more errors when they switch their attention frequently. Performance suffers: tasks take longer to complete, and the quality of work declines. Medical professionals, pilots, and other high-stakes workers have long known this; now the rest of us are discovering it in our daily digital lives.</p><p><strong>A </strong><a href=""https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250718/Social-media-use-linked-to-declining-focus-and-emotional-strain-in-youth.aspx""><strong>2025 NTU Singapore study</strong></a><strong> found that over two-thirds of young people reported difficulty focusing, with many struggling to engage with content lasting more than a minute.</strong> Heavy users (those clocking five or more hours daily) were significantly more likely to experience what researchers call “attention fragmentation symptoms,” alongside weaker working memory. These aren’t just numbers; they represent real-world impacts on how we think, learn, and work.</p><h3><strong>Can we reclaim our focus?</strong></h3><p>Before you throw your phone into the nearest body of water, there is some cause for optimism. Gloria Mark emphasises that our ability to focus isn’t lost; it’s just changing. <strong>The key, she argues, is developing what she calls </strong><a href=""https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/work-culture/gloria-mark-how-to-get-your-attention-span-back""><strong>“meta-awareness”</strong></a><strong>: </strong>the skill of catching yourself mid-drift, mid-scroll, or mid-sentence, and consciously deciding whether to follow that impulse or pull your attention back.</p><p>In one study, participants were asked to estimate how often they switched tasks. They guessed around 15 times per hour. The actual number? Over 30. Simply becoming aware of how fragmented our attention really is can be a powerful first step toward change.</p><p>She also champions the value of what she calls “rote activity,” meaning simple, mindless tasks like playing a quick game or doing something repetitive. These give our overtaxed minds a genuine break. Think of it as cognitive snacking: strategic mental downtime that can actually help replenish our attentional resources rather than deplete them further.</p><figure><img alt=""Infographic comparing “Traditional Content” versus ‘Microlearning.” Left side shows an overwhelmed person surrounded by chaotic app icons and notifications with a stopwatch indicating 8 seconds, leading to a confused head silhouette with a question mark.

Bottom text highlights “15-fold improvement” with the tagline “Intention &gt; Engagement.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IvpJqk7aTD7RgRlyLa10lQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p><strong>There’s also </strong><a href=""https://www.amraandelma.com/user-attention-span-statistics/""><strong>evidence that microlearning</strong></a><strong> can actually stretch attention spans from 8 seconds to 2 minutes.</strong> This type of short, focused video content is designed with intention rather than just engagement, and the results speak for themselves: a 15-fold improvement simply by changing how content is delivered. The difference between content designed to capture attention and content designed to build it may well be the cognitive battleground of the coming years.</p><h3><strong>The bottom line</strong></h3><p>We are, in many ways, living through an unprecedented experiment in human attention. AI-generated content is flooding the internet, algorithms are becoming ever more sophisticated at predicting and exploiting our psychological vulnerabilities, and <strong>our brains, evolved for a very different information environment, are scrambling to adapt.</strong></p><p>The research shows it’s not a simple story. Yes, our attention spans are shrinking, and yes, the combination of short-form video platforms and AI-generated content appears to be accelerating this trend. The neurological evidence suggests real changes in how our brains process information, particularly among younger users whose prefrontal cortices are still developing.</p><p><strong>But humans have always been remarkably adaptable creatures.</strong> The challenge now is to become intentional about our relationship with technology: to recognise when we’re being pulled into patterns that don’t serve us, and to actively cultivate the focused attention that deeper thinking requires.</p><p>After all, the irony would be too rich if we couldn’t even pay attention long enough to notice we’d lost it.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Thanks for reading! 📖</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote><em>If you liked this post, </em><a href=""https://medium.com/@doracee""><em>follow me on Medium</em></a><em> for more!</em></blockquote><h3><strong>References &amp; Credits</strong></h3><ul><li>Mark, G.

By flushing context between iterations and storing state in files, each run can start clean.”</li><li><a href=""https://veen.com/jeff/archives/coding-agents-design.html?ref=sidebar""><strong>On coding agents and the future of design</strong></a><strong> →</strong><br />“Recently, many non-developers, myself included, have found that using Claude Code with files locally can be an incredibly effective way to get work done.

I feel a lot, as a writer by profession and heart.</p><p>I’ve gone through the seven stages of grief with AI a couple of times.</p><p>Shock. It can write better than many.</p><p>Denial. It’s not going to affect me.</p><p>Anger. When my first clients started using it instead of paying me to write.</p><p>Guilt. When I started using it myself.</p><p>Depression. Realizing what it’s done to the quality of writing. Experiencing the downside of giving everybody a cheap tool to post whatever they want, without a human edit, everywhere I scroll. Its impact on the environment, people, the economy.</p><p>Acceptance. I have to deal with it; there is no turning back.</p><p>Hope. Some days, like today, I have a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Maybe, between the repetitive phrasing and slightly off tone, maybe, somewhere between the word “groundbreaking” and exhaustive punctuation, there it is: an opportunity for writers to claim back their art.</p><p>To finally separate writing as a <em>tool</em> to create content, from writing, the art, the act itself, the beauty.</p><p>This post is about how to get there.</p><h4>It doesn’t have to be perfect. It has to be real.</h4><p>I’ve always loved writing, and I’ve always been frustrated with the number of typos that get away from me. My brain thinks quickly. I hate re-reading what I’ve written, so it happens. People might think I’m dumb for correcting typos too late or not at all, especially in the days of auto-correct. But I have embraced the typo. It’ll be there, maybe next to a comma that’s in the wrong place, but instead of thinking I’m no skilled writer, I hope you appreciate that I actually did write that. I didn’t tell a machine to. It came out as intended. It lived a little.</p><p>A lot of our linguistic developments originate from typos and that <em>laziness</em> that makes you not want to write certain words: definitly (how do you spell that?) becomes def, to be honest, becomes tbh, going to gonna, because to cuz. Other changes stem from a word not fully saying what it has to say: girl becomes gurl or giiiirl. Meaning on a “if you know you know basis”. That <em>if </em>is what makes us human. That nuance is realness.</p><p>A machine simply knows, or it doesn’t.</p><p><strong>How to embrace this</strong>: Apply fewer filters to your own writing and more to the writing you consume.</p><h4>Format matters.</h4><p>For me, the worst thing about AI writing isn’t the takeover of the em dash, or that everything sounds the same, it’s that so much is written that really shouldn’t be. Why write about your rebrand when you can show me? Why tell me about your course when you could just give me a snippet of your teaching?</p><p>With AI, it’s easier to create content that passes most people’s bar for what’s good enough. And so more content is created. We scroll our way through it. We barely take it in. Most of that content shouldn’t be. Or it could be something else. Just because writing is easy doesn’t mean that’s what you should be doing.</p><p><strong>How to embrace this:</strong> Ask yourself (or your boss) does this have to be? And if yes, how does this have to be?</p><h4>Effort is a good thing.</h4><p>Imagine writing would take the effort it used to take: coming up with an idea for what you want to put out there. Thinking of what you want to say. Breaking it down into pieces. Structuring it. Finding the right tone. Drafting it. Editing it. Putting parts of yourself in there. Wondering if that sentence comes across right or if you should use a different word there.</p><p>If this were still the required effort, you might post less. Companies would too: if every piece of content they published still took a few hours to create, sign-off and distribute, they’d think twice before creating it.</p><p><strong>How to embrace this</strong>: Remind yourself that effort is good. Keep a personal bar for quality and don’t let the pressure of <em>easier with AI</em> get to you.</p><p>I try to only write stuff that I think is worth the effort. Why would AI change that?</p><h4>Believe in your voice.</h4><p>Everything AI writes does sound the same. It’s recognizable for most. If you’re a writer, you can easily spot the patterns. If you aren’t, you can still sense them.</p><p>That’s not inherently a bad thing. AI writing follows certain formats and structures because those have been proven to be easy to read, fast to take in, and drive the point home. It’s learned from the best: Hemingway to copywriters, accessibility specialists to lyricists.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JX65AmZNI55dBeyzO-4v-Q.png"" /><figcaption>Just as I was writing this post, I got this suggestion. Ironic, isn’t it?</figcaption></figure><p>The thing is: writing was never supposed to be the sum of its best parts.</p><p>Writing is meant to be personal.</p><p>That’s why even today, companies invest in tone and voice, trying to find a way to create content that feels like them, that others can recognize. That’s why you like some writers, and can’t get through a page by others.</p><p>What makes reading AI content tiresome is not the mass; it’s the lack of meaning, intention, personality, and yes, also humility.</p><p><strong>How to embrace this</strong>: Turn off Grammarly, auto-correct, and don’t ask ChatGPT to edit your work. Just write. Edit it yourself or ask a friend or colleague. Make a deliberate effort not to let AI touch your output and (re)learn how <em>you</em> write. And remind yourself: it’s OK to be unsure and say (write) that.</p><h4>Exit the machine and consume.</h4><p>Even before AI, I would seek inspiration in the analog. I‘d read poetry, write some of my own, pen on paper. I’d read books from various authors about different things, cultures, times: Dostoevsky. Kafka. Didion. Kerouac.</p><p>I almost always go back to my favorite recommendation for any writer, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letters_to_a_Young_Poet"">Rilke’s Letters to a Young Poet</a>, a quick (re)read.</p><p>It works with other forms of media and art too: Ingmar Bergman movies, music from past decades, art museums.</p><p>If you have the means to, go beyond media. Travel. Visit museums. Talk to strangers. Learn a new skill. Cook a complicated meal (not something you found on TikTok).</p><p>Turn off your phone. It’s going to feel uncomfortable and wrong. Trust me, it’s right. Especially if you want to create something meaningful.</p><p>The internet may be artificial intelligence’s turf – but that’s all it has.</p><p>We have everything and everywhere else.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/683/1*cpd2ewynUmYbgwahCIphlw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Robin Williams’ character in the Dead Poets Society: “But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive fo.r”</figcaption></figure><h4>AI has made me a greater writer.</h4><p>That’s what it’s done to me.</p><p>Not because it makes my work faster or easier. And not because it suggests different terms or corrects my punctuation. But because it has forced me to create with more intention than ever before. To reconsider each word carefully, to ensure it means what I want it to mean. To think, in every syllable,<em> is this human?</em></p><p>I write slower now than I have in years.</p><p>That’s made me better.</p><p>It’s helped me separate creating content from <em>creating</em>. It’s the distinction that makes all the difference.</p><p>In a world held together by doomscrolling and fake news, stepping away is a privilege. Creating is power.</p><p>Allow yourself.</p><p>Nicole is a Content Designer turned Design Director based in Stockholm, Sweden.

If you thought for a moment that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/london-fashion-week-haircut-trends-fall-winter-2025"">London</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/paris-fashion-week-haircut-trends-spring-summer-2026"">Paris</a>, and Milan were the only stylish European cities winning at <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/paris-fashion-week-street-style-spring-summer-2026"">fashion week</a>, let us put <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/copenhagen-fashion-week-spring-summer-2026-trends"">Copenhagen on the map</a>.<br /><br />Denmark’s capital has been quietly vying for the spotlight ever since it dipped its toe into Fashion Week in 2006, and now, almost 20 years later, it’s cemented its place as one of the most fashion-forward of the bunch.<br /> <br />This season, Copenhagen fall/winter 2026 is a masterclass in winter dressing, with faux-fur hats, oversized puffer jackets, and knitted hoods reigning supreme.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956574.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>While Oregon became a state in 1859, Latines have been part of the region for more than 150 years. Arriving mostly from Mexico within decades of statehood and, in some cases, before it, they often came as laborers, working railroads, agriculture, mining, and ranching. And today, the more than 70,000 Latines who call Portland home carry that legacy forward, contributing not only to the city’s economy but to its cultural fabric, politics, and future.</p>



<p>These days, much of the community — still overwhelmingly Mexican, but also shaped by migrants from across Central America, South America, and the Caribbean — are behind the city’s community pillars. During a recent trip to Portland, sponsored by <a href=""https://www.travelportland.com/"">Travel Portland</a>, I experienced these bustling Latine-owned businesses firsthand. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956576.jpeg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p>I spent the initial hours of my first night at <a href=""https://www.casaderitual.com/"">Casa de Ritual</a>, a wellness space and shop selling plant-based beauty and wellness products hand-mixed by owner and curanderista Yvonne Pérez Emerson. Drawing from her Indigenous Mexican and Scottish lineage, she also offers healing services including limpias, rebozo rituals, drum cleansing, and hapé ceremonies. After first holding me in a plática — a heart-to-heart conversation meant to better understand my emotional and spiritual state — I laid down on a bodywork table as she utilized prayer, sacred plants, cleansing smoke, breath, rhythm, and, at times, an egg to clear dense, stagnant energies and attachments throughout my body. The limpia, deeply emotional and beautifully insightful, eased the weight I had been carrying in my mind, body, and spirit, leaving me calm, open, and ready for the weekend ahead. </p>



<p>An adorably walkable city where history and progressive fight live on every corner, some mornings I walked past walls shouting reminders like “the border crossed us” — a popular Mexican saying that speaks to how the U.S. invaded Mexico and claimed its land, turning Mexican residents into so-called immigrants overnight — before grabbing a veggie burrito at Mexican-owned <a href=""https://losburrossupremos.com/"">Los Burros Supremos</a>. During the day, I hiked Forest Park, the largest urban park in the country, with <a href=""https://aroundportlandtours.com/"">Around Portland Tours</a>, learning both about how locals are protecting native flora and fauna as well as the mystical, age-old tales of women who fled and avenged the violence of men, their secrets and mysteries still held safe under the shadowy canopy of the Douglas firs. At night, I made my way to <a href=""https://milagro.org/"">Teatro Milagro</a>, a Latine arts and culture center that’s been serving the community since 1985, to catch <em>Autoretrato de Fridita,</em> a table-top puppetry show telling the story of a young Frida Kahlo and how she used her imagination and a box of paints to help her overcome challenges and create her own world amid the Mexican Revolution.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956580.jpeg?width=1024&amp;height=768&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=4%3A3"" /></figure></div>



<p>Other days, I was immersed in the city’s often-overlooked history. At the <a href=""https://www.ohs.org/"">Oregon Historical Society</a>, I learned about the nearly 15,000 Mexican men who came to Oregon during World War II through the Bracero Program, helping sustain the state’s farming and timber industries while U.S. men were deployed, and often experiencing wage theft, dangerous conditions, and segregation in return. At the <a href=""https://www.portlandmuseum.org/"">Portland Museum of Art</a>, I marveled at abstract works by Afro-Puerto Rican artist Iván Carmona Rosario that took inspiration from the mountains of a Caribbean land we both call home. And at <a href=""https://letshopscotch.com/locations/portland"">Hopscotch</a>, an immersive art experience, I wept in the Secret Garden, a room by artists Paloma Cortez and Pamela Rachel, where participants safely and anonymously share their deepest secrets, trusting strangers to listen and hold them beneath the shelter of artistic tree and bush forms. Finally, I ended the night, and my trip, at <a href=""https://www.barpalomar.com/"">Palomar</a>, a tropical, dimly-lit Cuban restaurant-bar, savoring a deeply satisfying jackfruit ropa vieja tostada.</p>



<p>When I boarded my flight back home to Orlando, I was deeply proud of the Latines who, for generations, have carved out home in this Northwest city, and eager to uplift their stories, spaces, and brands.</p>



<h2><strong>Orox’s Leather Goods</strong></h2>



<p>The people have spoken, and they have named <a href=""https://www.oroxleather.com/"">Orox</a> the best-smelling shop in Portland. The scent of warm leather may initially draw passersby into the store and workshop in the city’s Old Town district, but it’s the quality of the handbags, aprons, and jackets — and the multi-generational story behind each piece – that keeps them coming back. </p>



<p>The story of Orox — a play on Oregon and Oaxaca, the Mexican city where its origins begin — dates back to 1933, when Don Felipe Martínez Audelo began crafting custom leather baseball gear and belts for his own team, Los Audelos. His grandson, José, would later hone the family trade in Japan, where he spent years developing and manufacturing his own leather designs. When José eventually returned to Oaxaca, he believed he would leave the craft behind. Instead, his son, Martín, moved to Portland, studied business, and reignited the family legacy.</p>





<p>Today, Orox is a family-owned and -run business, grounded in the belief that family is formed not only through blood but also through chosen bonds. From the aprons worn by restaurant chefs, to the purses slung over women’s shoulders, to the journals university students fill with notes, each piece proudly carries the Orox name.</p>



<p>And the leather goods, designed by José in Oaxaca and handcrafted and assembled in the Portland shop, are made to last lifetimes. “We aim to create high-quality, durable goods that, while stylish, don’t go in and out of style,” the website notes of its items. “We hope that our products will be used and loved for years, and eventually passed on to the next generation.”</p>



<h2><strong>Make &amp; Mary’s Wellness Essentials</strong></h2>





<p>Drawing inspiration from her ancestral lineage — Mexican and Scottish — herbalist and curandera Yvonne Pérez Emerson uses earth-based wisdom to grow, blend, and bottle botanical offerings through her brand <a href=""https://makeandmary.com/"">Make &amp; Mary</a>. Since 2016, the brand has crafted and refined wellness and beauty creations that are natural, cruelty-free, vegan, and thoughtfully low-waste. The brand carries <a href=""https://makeandmary.com/collections/frontpage/products/face-body-serum"">face serums</a> formulated with rosehip seed, wild carrot seed, and rose geranium; bath essentials like <a href=""https://makeandmary.com/collections/ritual-bath-essentials/products/forest-bathing-body-polish"">Forest Bathing Body Polish</a>, made of mango, shea, lime, vetiver, and clary sage; nourishing <a href=""https://makeandmary.com/collections/frontpage/products/armonia-cacao-hemp-tea"">Armonía Cacao Hemp teas</a>; and home goods, like the delicious <a href=""https://makeandmary.com/collections/frontpage/products/soulshine-ritual-essential-oil-candle"">Soulshine Ritual Essential Oil Candle</a>, with notes of palo santo, holy basil, and ylang-ylang. The brick-and-mortar shop in Portland’s Alberta Arts District, where Pérez Emerson produces her entire line, also houses <a href=""https://www.casaderitual.com/"">Casa de Ritual</a>, a space for deeply spiritual and transformative self-care rituals and events.</p>



<h2><strong>Arium’s Houseplants </strong></h2>





<p>With the belief that “there is a plant out there for everyone,” Tylor Rogers and Alba Sanchez founded <a href=""https://ariumbotanicals.com"">Arium</a>, Latin for “a space or vessel that contains something,” in 2017. The queer-, Latine-, and vegan-owned houseplant shop is a safe space where all, regardless of gender, immigration status, or religion, are welcome — and where no question about plants is silly or illegitimate. It’s a space for learning about and taking home unusual plants. It nurses smaller <a href=""https://ariumbotanicals.com/collections/in-stock/products/agraecum-leonis"">Agraecum leonis</a>, <a href=""https://ariumbotanicals.com/collections/in-stock/products/ceropegia-ampliata"">Ceropegia ampliatas</a>, and <a href=""https://ariumbotanicals.com/collections/in-stock/products/dracaena-masoniana"">Dracaena masonianas</a> as well as larger <a href=""https://ariumbotanicals.com/collections/trees-pickup-or-local-delivery/products/monstera-deliciosa-xl"">Monstera deliciosas</a>, <a href=""https://ariumbotanicals.com/collections/trees-pickup-or-local-delivery/products/dracaena-marginata-xl-1"">Dracaena marginatas</a>, and <a href=""https://ariumbotanicals.com/collections/trees-pickup-or-local-delivery/products/ficus-elastica-burgundy"">Ficus elasticas</a>. Even more, they work with small businesses and makers for its stunning selection of handmade planters and ceramics.</p>



<h2><strong>Nossa Familia Coffee</strong></h2>





<p><br /><a href=""https://www.nossacoffee.com"">Nossa Familia Coffee</a> was founded in Portland in 2004, but owner Augusto Carneiro comes from a lineage of coffee growers in the highlands of his homeland, Brazil, that dates back to the 1890s. After a career in mechanical engineering left him unfulfilled, he found his thoughts drifting back to his childhood and the time he spent working on his family’s coffee farms in Brazil. Nossa Familia, Portuguese for “our family,” ultimately brought those reveries, and ancestral traditions, into his new life in the Northwest. But his business, which now comprises a Portland-based roastery and two zero-waste cafés, is still deeply rooted in home, working with coffee-growers in Brazil as well as in Guatemala, Nicaragua, Peru, Ethiopia, and more. </p>



<h2><strong>La Familia Cider </strong></h2>



<p>As a first-generation Mexican immigrant family, the Gonzalezes wanted to create something that was at once Oregonian and Mexican. When wife and mother Shani tasted locally-made cider, she had the idea of combining Oregon’s new craft cider movement with Mexico’s passion for fresh-fruit drinks. After convincing her husband and children, <a href=""https://lafamiliacider.com/"">La Familia Cider</a>, founded in 2017, was born. </p>





<p>Every cider is crafted with 100% Northwest apple juice, using mainstay flavors like manzana, tamarindo, and hibiscus (or the seasonal guayaba flavor) to offer distinctive hard ciders inspired by Mexico’s aguas frescas. Named “Best Taproom of Salem, Oregon,” La Familia operates out of Salem and Portland, and can be found in more than 500 local shops around Oregon and Washington. Helping the cider taste even sweeter: a percentage of La Familia Cider’s profits are donated to organizations supporting immigrants’ rights.<br /></p>

<p><strong>Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?</strong><br />There wasn’t really an expectation from my parents, but it was understood that that would be my path from an early age. I graduated valedictorian in high school and took my studies very seriously. I did go to a private liberal arts college in Utah, where I got a lot of scholarships. For my first three years, I had to take out federal AND private loans for what scholarships did not cover. For the last year, scholarships covered mostly all my costs, and I paid out of savings for the small remainder of what was left. I supported myself financially throughout college, and I am responsible for paying my student loan debt off by myself, and I had known this was going to be the case my whole life.<br /><br /><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?</strong><br />I don’t recall hearing or having many financial conversations when I was really young. When I was about 10, my dad tried to teach me about money through people like Tony Robbins, but I HATED when he made me listen to him or read books on money (why was I being forced to read <em>The Richest Man in Babylon</em> this young? And I DID do it because I am nothing if not persistent). My parents split up when I was in middle school, and that was when I became very aware of money. My mom didn’t have a job because my dad wanted to “take care of the family,” so she had to work minimum-wage jobs to care for us up until the past few years. My dad didn’t make a lot of money at this time (he is an entrepreneurial doctor), so he wasn’t providing much more than the bare minimum. My four siblings and I had homes, beds to sleep in, and food to eat, thanks to governmental assistance, but weren’t given money for new clothes or spending money — and we’d sometimes struggle with heating our house in the winter. I am <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eldest-daughter-syndrome-oldest-sibling-family-responsibilities"">the eldest daughter</a>, so I was brought into a lot of these conversations and was made very aware of our financial situation as a teenager.<br /><br /><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?</strong><br />When I was 12, I started babysitting. I babysat the same family for five summers throughout middle school and high school. I got it to pay for my own clothes, fun experiences, and gas. I also tutored when I was in high school. I had short stints at Pizza Hut and a local chain restaurant (I hate the food and restaurant industry). My first “real” job that I kept for a long time was at a local pharmacy as a delivery driver.<br /><br /><strong>Did you worry about money growing up?</strong><br />When I was very young, no. I had a very comfortable childhood — we went on family vacations, I went on multiple shopping sprees a year, and I engaged in many extra-curricular activities. After my parents’ divorce, yes! I stopped myself from doing extracurricular activities because I didn’t want to ask my parents for money and I worked a lot as a teenager. I wanted to have fun money to go out with my best friends, and I saved up a lot of money to move out for college. I think all my parents provided for that was the cost of my first plane ticket to Utah.<br /><br /><strong>Do you worry about money now?</strong><br />Yes and no. I definitely am aware of lifestyle creep, but I’ve been quietly letting myself indulge in the luxury of making more money than I ever have before. I am smart and cognizant of how I spend my money. If something comes up, I usually have the money to cover it. I know I will not be able to afford to buy a house, or retire young, or even comfortably have children on the salary I have now in Chicago, but I have high hopes for myself and I know I will only grow in my career. Also, I sometimes do have the Gen Z view of having no hope for the future of our economy… I barely even expect to be able to ever buy a house or retire. I used to have a lot of money anxiety, and I’m honestly proud of where I’m at now — even if it’s sort of fatalistic. I try not to think too much about the future while also saving what I can. I’m working hard, and I’m going to enjoy my life now! Sorry if this is problematic!<br /><br /><strong>At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?</strong><br />Even though I pay for mostly everything by myself, my mom covers streaming services and still pays for my phone bill and iCloud storage. When I visit home, my mom, dad, or grandma pretty much cover anything I need when I’m with them. If I’m alone, I pay. If I’m with my younger sisters, I often cover their expenses, as well. I know if I were to need it, I could always move back home and in with my mom, dad, or grandma. <br /><br /><strong>Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.</strong><br />When I graduated high school, I got a lot of money from extended family and friends (I’m not sure how much), and $1,000 from my grandfather when I graduated college that I used to buy my car in Utah (which I have since sold, and lost money on by the way… I’m still angry about that). Other than those monetary gifts, no. <br /></p>



<h3>Day One: Thursday</h3>



<p>6:15 a.m. — I finally wake up after snoozing my alarm a few times (I’ve gotten into a bad habit of this; I haven’t been sleeping well recently) and drag myself out of bed. My day always starts in the bathroom brushing my teeth and doing my skincare (CosRX snail mucin, Vanicream moisturizer, and Innisfree sunscreen). </p>



<p>6:30 a.m. — I make my morning coffee (iced hazelnut oatmilk lattes every morning using my Gemini Express), feed my cat, R., roll out my yoga mat for a 10 minute morning flow, and then get ready for the day. </p>



<p>7:15 a.m. — Breakfast time. This morning, I’m having egg whites and spinach, chicken sausage, and a piece of buttered toast. I have some version of this pretty much every morning. </p>



<p>7:40 a.m. — I head out the door after saying bye to R. I take the bus to work this morning. It’s free every time I tap into public transit because I pay for the unlimited monthly CTA pass (included in expenses above).</p>



<p>8:00 a.m. — Once I arrive at work, I put my lunch in the fridge and set myself up for the day. In the morning, I spend some time planning my day, responding to emails, and getting organized. This morning I’m drinking a blood orange kombucha I brought from home.</p>



<p>10:40 a.m. — I spend the morning working on content planning and creation. I wear a lot of different hats in my full-time position, so I’m always doing something different. I also take a break to eat the ripest, most delicious farmers’ market peach.</p>



<p>12:00 p.m. — Lunch break. I eat what I brought from home (it’s a beef bowl lol) and then go on my lunchtime walk. I spend some of it researching a potential therapist. I haven’t been in a few years, and feel like I really need to be back in therapy. My anxiety has gotten, and is getting, exponentially worse as I get older. I don’t want to pay for it at all, though, which is why I’ve been putting off finding a new one. I try calling the office of a therapist that looks somewhat promising, but they don’t answer. I leave a voicemail.</p>



<p>3:30 p.m. — My afternoon consists of more caption writing and creative ideation. I break to chat with a colleague about how her daughter’s college move-in day went. I love talking to my colleagues, which doesn’t happen that often. I’m almost always one of a few people in-office. I eat two chocolate caramels, then start to wrap up the workday.</p>



<p>4:00 p.m. — I leave work and walk home. I either like to walk to or from work. I prefer walking home FROM work, and now that it’s not as hot outside, I can finally do that. I call my mom on the walk home after I try the therapist’s office once again (they don’t answer).</p>



<p>4:30 p.m. — Home! I do my dishes from this morning, scoop litter, and get dressed. My best friend, M., and I have plans tonight that we’ve been wanting to do since last summer and I’m very excited! Before she gets to my house, I spend some time doing some of my freelance tasks. Today, I am doing community management and posting on socials. </p>



<p>5:00 p.m. — M. comes over and we start our trek to the restaurant. It takes a long time because we are using public transportation and it’s quite far north. We just chat the whole way about life updates. On our walk to the restaurant, we get stuck behind a HUGE group of people wearing all white. They end up situating themselves in the grass across from the restaurant, and the rest of our night is spent trying to figure out what is going on. We discover that it’s some sort of all white “dinner party” that you have to pay $100 to go to even though you have to bring your own chairs, table, food, cups, etc. Weird?!</p>



<p>7:00 p.m. — M. and I eat our food, listen to the live band that’s playing, talk some more, and watch the sunset over the lake. It’s a beautiful night, and quite chilly. I’m excited for fall because fall in Chicago rules. We split cheese curds, and I get the blackened shrimp tacos. <strong>$36.78</strong></p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — We finally catch the bus home and laugh the whole way. It was a silly night for some reason. I arrive home to my boyfriend, N., putting our new dining table and chairs together. We just moved in together last month, so we’re still getting settled and buying new furniture. Previously (and in my last Money Diary) I lived with my best friend M. All three of us moved to Chicago together — we are besties!</p>



<p>10:00 p.m. — I shower, do my skincare (double cleanse with Dr. Hauschka soothing cleansing milk and Drunk Elephant jelly cleanser, Vanicream moisturizer, Cetaphil eye cream), and fall asleep watching <em>The White Lotus</em> on my phone.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $36.78</strong></p>

<h3>Day Two: Friday</h3>



<p>6:20 a.m. — I wake up after snoozing my alarms multiple times (again). R. is very obsessed with me this morning and follows me around, watching everything I do. He has a bowl of food, so he just wants my attention. I make sure to give him some! He’s the cutest. </p>



<p>7:40 a.m. — After my morning routine, I take the bus to work. I arrive at work about 10 minutes later — this was one of my smoothest commutes in a while! </p>



<p>9:00 a.m. — I was not very hungry this morning and I only had a small bowl of chia seed pudding, so I get hungry around this time. I eat the Mid-Day Square I brought from home to hopefully hold me over until lunch.</p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — I spend my morning doing administrative tasks and grant searching. I get hungry and take my break for lunch. I eat (the same lunch as yesterday), go outside, and read a little bit of my current book (I am re-reading <em>Normal People</em> by Sally Rooney). I also book a massage for next week because M. (bff) got me a gift card for my birthday that I still haven’t used.</p>



<p>4:00 p.m. — The afternoon DRAGS ON, but it’s finally time to go. We had summer Fridays, and this was the first Friday back to normal hours. Rough. I am a firm believer that it should be company policy everywhere that work should end early on Fridays. I eat a peach at some point and I call my sister, A., on the walk home. She’s a freshman in college, and just moved in yesterday.</p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — After doing some chores, putting a load of laundry in, and eating a snack (almonds, cheese, cranberries), I go on a walk. It ends up being a lot longer than expected because I call my grandma and we talk about her life in her 20s. It was a very sweet conversation. I end up at Trader Joe’s and buy myself pork dumplings, ravioli, a Chomps stick, bacon and egg gummies, and white cheddar popcorn. I talk to my mom and sister on the walk home. <strong>$13.70</strong></p>



<p>8:00 p.m. — I spend my evening eating the pork dumplings and watching <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em>. N. wants to watch <em>The White Lotus</em> with me but I end up falling asleep at 9:30. I feel like something is wrong with me because I can’t stay awake past 10 p.m. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $13.70</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Three: Saturday</h3>



<p>7:45 a.m. — I wake up before my alarm and lay in bed for a while. I try not to do this, but I am SO TIRED. I feel delusional getting up and doing my morning routine.</p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — I realize what time it is and start quickly getting ready. I eat some chia seed pudding, drink a coffee, get dressed, and pack my bag. I head to the bus stop around 9:15. </p>



<p>9:30 a.m. — Time for concrete beach mat pilates! I signed up for the class and paid the $5 ticket fee a few weeks ago. It’s a fun class and it’s hotter outside than I was expecting. The instructor partnered with a chiropractic place that was giving complimentary massages after the workout. I get a quick five-minute massage and a voucher to come in for a free session, so I schedule that for Tuesday. I make a mental note to move the one I booked yesterday to a later date. </p>



<p>11:00 a.m. — I get off my bus stop and walk to the farmers’ market. I grab a breakfast sandwich because I am craving one so bad… I can’t help it. <strong>$18.54</strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — I shower and get ready for my afternoon plans. Before we leave, I lounge around, reading (<em>Ducks, Newburyport</em> by Lucy Ellmann is my current at-home read), scrolling on my phone, drinking another latte, moving my massage appointment, and facetiming A. I also buy some new sheets for the fall/winter. I decide on a red and cream striped duvet cover, brown sheets, and brown pillow cases. I hope they’re comfy — I rarely ever treat myself to a purchase like this. <strong>$127.37</strong></p>



<p>3:00 p.m. — N. and I head out for the afternoon. Our friend P. is having her birthday party, frat boy themed. I am wearing N.’s Dolphins jersey for the occasion. We uber there because we are already running late. <strong>$5.00</strong></p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — I spend the afternoon hanging out with my friends, laughing, and having a good time. We don’t leave P.’s house.</p>



<p>9:30 p.m. — At around this time, everyone starts to leave the party. N. and I head home on the bus. Once we get home, he makes me ravioli and I fall asleep around 11:30. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $150.91</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Four: Sunday</h3>



<p>10:00 a.m. — I wake up to my alarm going off. I knew I was going to sleep in because I’ve been so tired recently, but I still wanted to wake up relatively early because I don’t like to waste my weekends sleeping. </p>



<p>10:30 a.m. — I pretty much throw myself up out of bed, get dressed in sweats, and start cleaning the house. I clean the kitchen, floors, and even get out my window squeegee to clean the windows from the outside. It feels great to have a clean house. I eat breakfast at some point in this time frame (egg whites, spinach, toast, and chicken sausage). </p>



<p>1:00 p.m. — Once I finish cleaning, N. and I head out for a lunch date. We take the train to a pizza spot where we get the monthly special pizza (ricotta, pickled red onions, chorizo verde, jalapeno, and potatoes). It was so good! <strong>$23.35</strong></p>



<p>3:00 p.m. — When we get home, we lounge around, half-napping with R. on the bed. I watch a little bit of YouTube vlogs. </p>



<p>4:00 p.m. — I get up, put on shoes, and head out on a walk. I walk to a nearby park and spend about an hour reading and finishing <em>Normal People</em>. I listen to music while I read, and it’s a wonderful time. The weather is absolutely perfect today. I stop at Target on the way home and get some kombucha and an Olipop. <strong>$14.37</strong></p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — Once I get home, I set up the house for the evening. I light a candle, do some dishes, and pack my bag for work tomorrow. N. went out to get us groceries for Sunday night dinner. <strong>$30.66</strong></p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — After I take a shower, I sit on the couch and watch <em>The White Lotus</em> while N. makes us dinner. We’ve been watching it for a few weeks and want to finish it tonight. </p>



<p>9:30 p.m. — Late dinner because N. had to keep taking breaks to do his Fantasy Football draft (lol). We eat and then finish the show. Both of our reactions were “… that’s it?” I brush my teeth and fall asleep around 11:30. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $68.38</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Five: Monday</h3>



<p>6:15 a.m. — I wake up and let myself scroll for a few minutes. I do my morning routine, and I’m out the door at 7:40 this morning. I take the bus to work.</p>



<p>8:00 a.m. — Once at work, I take a few minutes to settle in and then immediately start helping a colleague set up for a session that is going on today in her Center. </p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — I spend my morning doing admin work, planning for the week, scheduling posts on socials, and attending a meeting. I eat a donut that someone brought in for our office intern’s first day of classes (jelly-filled, of course). </p>



<p>12:00 p.m. — Lunch time! Today is the first day of classes at our university and, to celebrate, we are having a faculty and staff lunch. Today’s menu is Greek food: chicken gyros, potatoes, salad, and baklava. </p>



<p>2:15 p.m. — I’ve been trying to import data into a new software we are using and the system is giving me SUCH a hard time. I get myself Dunkin’ as a treat. They have a new cereal milk latte that I try despite knowing it’s going to give me a stomachache. It tastes like dessert. I save the other half for tomorrow morning (this might be gross, but I’m not known for listening to food/drink rules). <strong>$6.68</strong></p>



<p>4:15 p.m. — Home from work. I have a 4:45 pm biweekly Monday meeting that I just like to be home for. </p>



<p>5:45 p.m. — My meeting ends and I heat up leftovers to eat for dinner (meatloaf and potatoes). N. has a virtual appointment so I leave to give him some privacy. I facetime A. while sitting in the park. Her first day of classes is tomorrow so we just chat about how she’s feeling. I love my sisters!</p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — I read my book for a little bit while N. finishes building the dining room chairs, but then he asks for my help. We try to build this one chair for two HOURS and we can’t get it! We give up and vow to work on it later. </p>



<p>11:30 p.m. — I’m in bed after my shower and skincare. I fall asleep watching YouTube. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $6.68</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Six: Tuesday</h3>



<p>6:30 a.m. — I am UP!!! I am still so tired… I can’t seem to wake up on time (I try to wake up at 5:45). Morning routine, breakfast, feed R., out the door. I walk to work this morning because I feel like I need some time to myself. </p>



<p>8:15 a.m. — I arrive at work. This morning, I do admin work, edit some email copy, and work on the data import I was working on yesterday. I also take a minute to pay my student loans (included in monthly expenses). </p>



<p>12:00 p.m. — I take my lunch break. I eat leftover pizza from Sunday and go to my favorite spot outside to read my book for a bit. It’s right by a fountain and lots of older people are always here as well — reading, meeting up with their friends, or just enjoying their time. They make me happy to be around.</p>



<p>4:00 p.m. — This afternoon, I process an invoice and spend the rest of my time working on more projects related to the new software implementation. By new, I mean it’s a few months old and this transition is taking much longer than anticipated. That’s okay, though — I sometimes enjoy tedious work. I leave work and take the bus to the place I’m getting my massage today.</p>



<p>5:45 p.m. — After a long bus ride and a FAKE massage appointment, I wait for the bus home. I’m mad they told me I get a free massage today — they just took X-rays of me. I should’ve known it was too good to be true… I reschedule my original massage AGAIN while waiting for the bus home.</p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — I spend alllll night doing freelance work while lying in bed with R. For dinner, I eat leftover meatloaf with some rice and sweet potatoes. I also drink the Olipop I bought on Sunday. </p>



<p>10:30 p.m. — After I shower and get ready for bed, I watch <em>Boogie Nights</em> on my laptop. It’s such a fun movie and VERY entertaining. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $0.00</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Seven: Wednesday</h3>



<p>6:30 a.m. — I wake up later without stressing because Wednesday is my WFH day. I get up, do my morning routine, read in bed, make coffee, and journal. </p>



<p>7:30 a.m. — When N. leaves for work, I walk outside with him and head to the farmers’ market in my neighborhood. There, I buy apricots (I like to get fruit at the farmers’ market to snack on), tomatoes (because they are so perfect right now), a raspberry rose croissant (looked too good to pass up), and a loaf of sourdough. I eat half of my croissant on a park bench, letting the sun shine in my face, and then head back home. <strong>$26.75</strong></p>



<p>10:30 a.m. — After a few hours of work, I take a break to order two books I want to read soon. I’m really good about not buying new books until I read all of my current ones. I am trying to start a personal library, which is basically just a fun way to say I collect books. I do read all of them, though! <strong>$24.89</strong></p>



<p>12:00 p.m. — I take another little break to make lunch. I eat slices of the loaf I bought this morning with cottage cheese and sliced tomatoes on top. Sooooo good! I eat while I work. Today I’m working on planning a social media promotional campaign for an event, doing grant research, and problem-solving with a vendor. </p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — Now I take my “lunch break.” When I WFH, I like my lunch break to be some sort of movement. Today, I follow a pilates video on YouTube. </p>



<p>4:00 p.m. — Once I finish my work for the day, I head out for a walk and to read in the park (my favorite activity, if you can’t tell). I stay for about an hour.</p>



<p>6:00 p.m. — After eating dinner (ravioli and chicken sausage), I take a quick nap with R. curled up next to me. I wake up abruptly 20 minutes later and quickly get ready to go to a nearby bar for a <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em> watch party with my friends. I stop at Walgreens on the way to buy a bag of chips (for me) and peach rings (for my friend). <strong>$6.95</strong></p>



<p>7:15 p.m. — I grab a table at the bar and wait for my friends to arrive. The episode starts at 7:30 and we have a blast. Normally, this is not the type of media I enjoy consuming, but I’m addicted to this show. We snack on the free popcorn the bar has and eat snacks we brought (the bar doesn’t serve food). I don’t get anything because I don’t really drink, and I do feel bad about it. I like to give my money to local places if I’m going to them.</p>



<p>8:45 p.m. — I bus back home with my friend. Once I get home, I take a quick shower and pretty much go right to bed. I want to be well-rested for the rest of my week.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $58.59</strong></p>

<h3>Conclusion </h3>



<p>This week was pretty normal for me to be honest. I spend most of my money on food and drink — both groceries and going out to eat. I already track my spending and I’m very aware of it, but it’s always fun to do it journal-entry style! I COULD spend less money going out to eat… but will I? Maybe in the winter when it’s too cold in Chicago to leave my house…</p>

<p>Mere minutes into <em><a href=""https://www.theringer.com/2026/01/26/marvel/what-you-need-to-know-before-watching-wonder-man-mcu"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wonder Man</a>,</em> I had to take a break from the series. Not because it wasn’t good — it’s <em>great</em> — but because I saw so much of myself in <a href=""https://www.disneyplus.com/explore/articles/marvels-wonder-man"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Simon Williams</a> and his relentless anxiety, it was, well, making me anxious. Lately, it feels like conversations surrounding representation and have been flattened, and we decide if a piece of art is good only if we can see ourselves in it. I don’t think that’s true. And I think <em><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/arts/television/wonder-man.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wonder Man</a> </em>is a brilliant show, whether you’re a self-flagulating overthinker like Simon and me or not, but when I was watching it, I was struck by how real he felt, and how rarely we get to see anxious Black characters, especially Black men, onscreen. </p>



<p>All eight episodes of <em><a href=""https://decider.com/2026/01/27/what-time-does-wonder-man-premiere-on-disney/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wonder Man</a></em><a href=""https://decider.com/2026/01/27/what-time-does-wonder-man-premiere-on-disney/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> drop on Disney+ today</a> and in the Marvel series, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/06/10541868/yahya-abdul-mateen-ii-rom-com-movies"">Yahya Abdul-Mateen II</a> stars as Simon, a struggling actor who just wants to be seen for his craft, not the anger-induced superpowers he’s desperately trying to hide and has no idea what to do with. You may think you’re getting an origin story for one of Marvel’s most underrated superheroes, but as its eight episodes unfold, <em>Wonder Man</em> quietly transforms into one of the most honest portrayals of anxiety I’ve seen in a superhero show, maybe in <em>any</em> show. Simon’s overthinking, his paralysis in the face of opportunity, his fear that one misstep will cost him everything hit so close to home. Created by Destin Daniel Cretton (<a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2021-09-02/shang-chi-simu-liu-marvel-asian-hero"">“Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings”</a>) and Andrew Guest (who has written for “Community” and “Brooklyn Nine-Nine”), <em>Wonder Man</em> is a slow burn meditation on Hollywood, ambition, and who gets to be a hero. And after all these years of oversaturation accusations and critiques that superhero projects have nothing more to offer, this is the MCU at its best and most original.  </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956454.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=429&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A429"" /><figcaption>Simon Williams/Wonder Man (Yahya Adbul-Mateen II) in Marvel Television’s WONDER MAN, exclusively on Disney+.

<p>There’s this scene early in the series where Simon shows up to set for a small role on <em>American Horror Story</em>. He’s done his research, prepared a whole backstory, and workshopped different line deliveries. He’s in his head. When he starts suggesting tweaks to the scene, the director humors him at first, then grows frustrated, and finally, he gets fired on the spot. Watching Simon’s face collapse as he realizes he’s sabotaged himself yet again — that he tried so hard to be excellent that he forgot to just <em>be</em> — is what made me pause the episode. I had to sit with it for a minute because I’ve been that person, the one so terrified of mediocrity that I self sabotage, the one who shows up with five times the preparation and still feels like an imposter. But Simon isn’t shy or lacking confidence necessarily, he’s anxious because he wants to be the best. He’s anxious because he feels like he knows the character better than anyone, even the director. It’s bravado and fear warring with and wrapped up in each other, and it’s a dangerous combination. </p>



<p>“Anxiety is kind of new to me too. I understand what it’s like,” Abdul Mateen II says, sitting across from me during the film’s junket in Los Angeles. “As an actor, a part of our job is to be able to identify the anxieties and to be able to use our tools to decrease it and then to work through it, to ‘tolerate our discomfort.’” </p>



<p>And it is uncomfortable at times to watch Simon war with his own mind, struggling through who he knows he can be and who he is. Abdul-Mateen II brings so much depth and sensitivity to Simon’s anxiety. This isn’t the one-note brooding, mysterious kind of troubled hero we’re used to seeing. Simon’s anxiety is mundane, messy, and for Abdul-Mateen II, it was personal. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>It was really gratifying, and sometimes scary at the same time, to show that vulnerability, to show that anxiety, to show what it looks like to just not be sure of myself at all but still have to proceed.</p><cite>Yahya Abdul-Mateen II </cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“It was really gratifying, and sometimes scary at the same time, to show that vulnerability, to show that anxiety, to show what it looks like to just not be sure of myself at all but still have to proceed, and to have the camera be <em>right here</em> while I’m doing that,” He says, gesturing with his hand close to his face. “To be feeling something before a scene and to realize,<em> ‘Oh, yeah that’s right, this is what Simon is feeling’.</em> Oh, OK so I’m right at home so just share it. I’m just there to share it.”</p>



<p>What Abdul-Mateen II shares is revelatory. It’s one of the strongest performances the MCU has ever seen. And at times when the script doesn’t give us much about Simon’s interior, Abdul-Mateen II fills in the rest of the story with his face. Simon’s anxiety shows up in him standing outside an audition rehearsing the same line forty-seven different ways, or calling his ex-girlfriend to apologize for apologizing too much, or him lying awake at 3 a.m. mentally cataloging every interaction he had that day, searching for where he went wrong. There’s a scene where Simon practices his audition in front of a bathroom mirror, and you can see him cycling through emotions — confidence, doubt, overcompensation, resignation — in the span of thirty seconds. It’s exhausting and exhilarating to watch Abdul-Mateen II work. It’s also deeply, painfully relatable. </p>



<p><em>Wonder Man</em> connects Simon’s anxiety to his Blackness without making it the sole defining factor. Simon doesn’t just want to be a good actor; he wants to prove he belongs in spaces that weren’t built for him. There’s this unspoken weight he carries, this understanding that his margin for error is razor-thin. One mistake and he’s not just Simon Williams who messed up; he’s a confirmation of every stereotype and every lowered expectation. It’s the burden of representation that so many Black creatives carry, the exhausting math of needing to be twice as excellent to be considered half as good. It’s such a prevailing understanding, it’s become a cliché. And so the show doesn’t need to spell this out in obvious dialogue, which I appreciate. Instead, it lives in Abdul-Mateen’s performance, the way Simon’s shoulders tense when he walks into a dinner full of white executives (save for his agent Janelle, played pitch perfectly <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wkum08eYhC8"">by X Mayo</a>) trying to push him to capitalize on his <em>Wonder Man</em> casting, the way he code-switches without even realizing he’s doing it, the way he shrinks around his overachieving brother and how the legacy of his late father is simmering beneath every decision Simon makes. </p>

<p>The genius of the series is pairing Simon with Sir Ben Kingsley’s Trevor Slattery, a washed-up actor (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxl6UhHaYic"">also known as The Mandarin,</a> making his fourth MCU appearance) who’s decided that “good enough” is, in fact, good enough. Trevor is delightfully shameless in his mediocrity. He shows up to auditions unprepared and somehow charms his way through. He forgets his lines and improvises. He lives in the moment because he’s already survived the worst his career can throw at him. He’s also acting as a double agent, spying on Simon for the government’s Department of Damage Control. Agent Cleary (<em>Succession’s </em>Arian Moayed) is his point person at the bureau tasked with bringing in “enhanced” individuals. This part of the script is its weakest, because it’s never really clear why Simon is a target when he’s hiding his powers and can barely control them, but the beauty of <em>Wonder Man</em> is that it doesn’t care much about the MCU politics of it all. This is a small story an unlikely friendship forged between two actors who approach life differently – one living like he’s got nothing to lose (Trevor) and the other carefully clinging to things he doesn’t have yet. </p>



<p>Their dynamic is hilarious. Simon’s anxious perfectionism is constantly butting up against Trevor’s chaotic “we’ll figure it out” energy and it’s also the emotional heart of the show. Trevor becomes the person who gives Simon permission to be imperfect, to make mistakes, to take up space without apology. Their friendship is a quiet rebellion. And when you juxtapose the purity of Simon and Trevor’s bond with what goes on between Byron Bowers’ DeMarr “Doorman” Davis and Josh Gad (playing the asshole version of himself) in Episode 4 (a truly revolutionary, gorgeous, gutting episode), it’s even more evident how special their friendship is. </p>



<p>My favorite scene of the series comes when Simon and Trevor are at the house of the famed eccentric director or <em>Wonder Man </em>(the movie within the show) participating in a day-long audition. When put on the spot to improvise a monologue, Simon cracks and resorts to reciting a scene from <em>Pretty Woman</em>. Yes, that <em>Pretty Woman</em>. Abdul Mateen II says he had fun channeling his inner Julia Roberts, but aside from the comedy of that scene, it’s more proof of Simon’s debilitating anxiety. </p>



<p>“That just shows how much of a wreck Simon is. Simon is a control freak. He has a photographic memory so he remembers every line from every movie he’s ever seen. He has it in his head. That was a lot of fun. He’s trying his best,” Abdul Mateen II says with a laugh. </p>



<p>I keep thinking about what Abdul-Mateen said in a <a href=""https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a70063756/yahya-abdul-mateen-ii-man-on-fire-wonder-man-interview/"">recent interview with Esquire</a>, how Simon “lives his life always trying to avoid the next worst thing” and that “it’s paralyzing.” That line stayed with me because it perfectly describes what so many of us are navigating, this constant vigilance, this bracing for impact, this belief that if we just work hard enough, prepare thoroughly enough, excel sufficiently enough, we can somehow protect ourselves from the unfairness we know is coming. But Simon’s journey in <em>Wonder Man </em>is learning that excellence isn’t armor. Sometimes it’s the opposite. Sometimes our desperate need to be exceptional keeps us from actually living, from taking risks, from being human. The show doesn’t offer easy answers (spoiler: Simon doesn’t suddenly stop being anxious by the finale) but it does give him permission to be a work in progress. To be, dare I say it, mediocre sometimes. And that feels radical.</p>

<p><em>Wonder Man </em>is technically a superhero show, but it’s really about what happens when you realize that the superpowers you’ve been hiding might be less scary than the ordinary vulnerabilities you refuse to show. The Marvel series is a surprisingly tender meditation on perfectionism, performance, and the paralyzing fear of not being enough. It’s about the courage it takes to just show up as yourself — flawed, uncertain, still figuring it out — in a world that demands perfection from people who look like you. Abdul-Mateen’s performance is quietly devastating in its specificity, and the series as a whole is a love letter to everyone who’s ever felt like they’re one mistake away from losing everything. It’s a reminder that sometimes the most revolutionary thing we can do is give ourselves permission to just be fine, not exceptional, not extraordinary, just <em>fine</em>. And, honestly, that might be the superpower we need most.</p>

<p>In some ways, it’s felt like we’ve grown up alongside <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DTpYCqxkmAv/"">Kiernan Shipka</a>. She had her first role as a baby on TV at just five months old on <em>ER</em>, before becoming Sally Draper in <em>Mad Men</em> in 2006. From there, she took on perfectly age-appropriate roles, voicing Jinora in Nickelodeon’s <em>The Legend of Korra</em>, and as the title character in YA series <em>Chilling Adventures of Sabrina</em>. Over the past two years, she’s started branching out into more mature roles, in films such as <em>Longlegs</em>, <em>Twisters </em>and <em>The Last Showgirl</em>, but her latest turn as <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2026-01-25/kiernan-shipka-industry-season-4-episode-3-haley"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Haley in </a><em><a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2026-01-25/kiernan-shipka-industry-season-4-episode-3-haley"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Industry</a></em><a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2026-01-25/kiernan-shipka-industry-season-4-episode-3-haley"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> Season 4</a> proves she’s well and truly shed her <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2024/04/11698623/quiet-on-set-nickelodeon-documentary-giovonnie-samuels-interview"">child-star</a> image. </p>



<p>During Episode 3, Shipka’s character is seen having a threesome with Henry (Kit Harington) and his wife Yasmin (Marisa Abela), who happen to yield an immense amount of power over her. As is the case with Industry, it’s a drawn-out sex scene, lingering much more than most TV shows dare. Shipka tells <em>Refinery29</em> she didn’t deliberately choose<em> </em>to be part of <em>Industry</em> for the sake of being seen as more grown up, but it’s come about in a natural and intentional way. “I’ve sort of taken my time [and] I think I was really itching to play something that was a bit more adult and a bit older, being that I’m 26 now. I was 25 when I shot the show, and I wanted to do something that was in that space and felt reflective of who I was [in terms of] the age,” Shipka says. “But I think if I had done it earlier, it would have been me forcing it, and this just felt like a show that I wanted to be part of anyway, and it was also a plus that I got to show myself in sort of a different way than people are used to seeing me.”</p>



<p>She acknowledges that it’s a “tricky transition” when you start as a child star, but the actor hasn’t been stressed about choosing the exact right career move. “I’ve always wanted to prioritise patience over doing something impulsive that wasn’t right. And I feel really lucky that I get to be part of great projects and pick fun things,” Shipka explains. “There’s pros and cons to starting that young, but I think there’s something inherently exciting about redefining yourself. And I find myself in that moment right now, and I find myself really excited by it.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>I think there’s something inherently exciting about redefining yourself. And I find myself in that moment right now, and I find myself really excited by it.</p><cite>Kiernan Shipka</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Joining an established and loved series in a later season is tough for even the most seasoned pros, yet Shipka wasn’t fazed by the high stakes. For the actor, she found the project excited her, and took value from each scene, including <em>that</em> sex scene in Episode 3. “That [scene] honestly has so much going on outside of the sex itself, like it’s a big emotional catalyst for all three characters in very vastly different ways. And I think that’s what I loved about the scene so much, was that it was kind of layered,” she recalls. “It was a really enriching scene to shoot. I mean, it felt like it was an important scene.”</p>



<p>The <em>Industry</em> creators have been vocal about how the show uses intimacy coordinators on set, especially seeing as the show has a high rate of nudity and sex throughout. Shipka says her sex scene with Harington and Abela was choreographed before the shoot day, so it didn’t feel uncomfortable at all. “Everything was talked about beforehand, and we had an intimacy coordinator and really mapped out the scene so that on the day we could just focus on the characters and the scene itself,” she says. “Everyone’s a pro, so it was nice.” Abela’s character Yasmin has an unusual connection with Haley, so every scene they shot together (including this one) helped develop their bond. “[Abela is] so magnetic, she’s so present. It’s so easy to act with her, because she’s so amazing. We had so much fun,” Shipka says. “I think there’s a really special bond between Haley and Yasmin that even sort of lifts off what’s scripted and is just sort of in the air. And so much of that is a testament to chemistry, and Marisa is just such a force that it’s so easy to be captivated by her.”</p>

<p>The star is unable to share any spoilers about how important her character Haley will be down the line, but hints that there could be a power shift. <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"">She seems to be at the bottom of the pecking order, with lines constantly being stepped over by her bosses (as expected, this is <em>Industry</em>, after all), but even the most die-hard fans will be intrigued by what’s to come.</span> “This season [circulates] around this theme of power and how power can look so different for different people. And I think you have someone like Haley, who presents as someone who is not in a position of power at all, and yet she finds it, and she finds her power throughout this system.</p>



<p>“I think it’s great to tell Haley’s version of that through her eyes, because it’s a version, and to tell only one story of power isn’t really the whole picture.”<br /></p>

<h2><strong>What is rosemary oil? </strong></h2>



<p>“Rosemary oil is the oil from the rosemary plant, also known as rosmarinus officinalis L.,” explains <a href=""https://www.philipkingsley.com/clinics/london-clinic/meet-the-team/zoe-passam.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Zoë Passam</a>, consultant trichologist at <a href=""https://www.philipkingsley.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Philip Kingsley</a>. For years, the herb has been used to treat a host of ailments, for aromatherapy, skincare formulas, and haircare.</p>



<p>“Rosemary has a long tradition of use as an important essential oil for a wide range of issues, most famously to improve memory and concentration, which goes back as far as ancient Greece,” adds Alison Pawlus, principal scientist <a href=""https://www.aveda.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">at Aveda</a>.</p>



<p>It’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/clean-skincare-beauty-ethics"">“natural”, too</a> — perhaps one reason why the ears of TikTokers have pricked up. “There’s growing interest in finding naturally derived solutions to help with hair growth, either to promote <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grow-out-bob-hair-care-expert-advice"">longer, healthier hair</a> or in individuals with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hair-loss-ptsd-medical-trauma"">hair thinning,</a>” explains Pawlus. </p>

<h2><strong>What are the benefits of rosemary oil for hair? </strong></h2>



<p>Rosemary oil has a host of potential benefits. “It contains compounds which have been shown to have some anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities,” explains <a href=""https://www.drsharonwong.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Sharon Wong</a>, consultant dermatologist and hair specialist. All such properties reduce <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/scalp-acne-shampoo"">scalp irritation</a>, while antioxidants specifically help protect your hair from external aggressors such as pollution. Put simply, this tends to equal stronger strands and a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/hair-care-growth-myths-advice"">healthier scalp</a>.</p>



<p>“Rosemary oil can help with nourishment and locking in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/protein-haircare-products-keratin"">the hair’s moisture</a>, and it has properties that improve blood circulation to the scalp, while getting rid of any bacteria that clog hair follicles,” adds <a href=""https://www.hannahgaboardi.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hannah Gaboardi</a>, leading trichologist and brand ambassador <a href=""https://www.viviscal.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">at Viviscal</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Is rosemary oil good for hair growth?</strong></h2>



<p>There has been some data that suggests rosemary oil could be good for hair growth, with two specific studies that point to its potential. “A <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">study in 2015</a> compared the effects of rosemary oil versus <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/04/11349959/tretinoin-retinol-for-hair-growth-differences"">2% minoxidil</a> [a topical medication] for the treatment of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/alopecia-black-women-hair-loss"">androgenetic alopecia</a> [male and female pattern hair loss] and, after six months, found a similar increase in hair counts with both treatments,” says Passam. Another <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9828867/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">study found</a> that rosemary [essential] oil was an effective treatment for the patchy hair loss condition known as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/alopecia-hair-loss-essay"">alopecia areata</a>.</p>



<p>Though promising, these studies are small, and the scientific researchis  still preliminary. To add, the data is directed towards genetic hair loss (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/living-with-alopecia"">androgenetic alopecia</a>) as opposed to analyzing specific types. Pawlus adds that rosemary oil has several beneficial compounds, but these studies speak exclusively of the essential oil, which is “the volatile, aromatic component of plants [what you smell], which excludes some of rosemary’s powerful antioxidants.”</p>



<p>The issue? The quality of the oil can vary. “It depends on many factors, including the growth conditions of the plant, the quality of the plant collected, and how it was handled prior to extraction,” says Pawlus.</p>

<h2>Is it safe to use rosemary oil on your hair and scalp?</h2>



<p>The experts say that, in theory, people with all hair types can use rosemary oil, but some may want to proceed with caution. “Although natural, as with all plant extracts and botanicals, rosemary oil extracts and the raw material itself can potentially cause skin irritation and allergic <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/05/10479537/why-are-allergies-so-bad-right-now"">contact dermatitis</a> in some people,” explains Dr. Wong.</p>



<p>A possible catalyst for irritation is when using the oil alone. Despite what the TikTok videos might suggest, pure rosemary essential oil (and essential oils in general) is very potent and could cause scalp irritation. Worse yet, it might have the opposite of the intended effect. “Maintaining a healthy scalp plays a fundamental role in supporting healthy hair growth by providing conditions to optimize the function of the hair follicle,” adds Dr. Wong. “There are many examples in which an unhealthy scalp can lead to increased hair loss such as eczema, psoriasis, fungal infections, or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/how-to-treat-scalp-conditions-afro-hair"">yeast overgrowth</a>.”</p>



<p>To that end, if you are going to use rosemary oil, make sure you’re diluting it with another oil-based product and massaging it into your scalp, says Gaboardi. “I recommend mixing four or five drops with a teaspoon of oil, like coconut oil. You can then massage it evenly into your scalp.” It is also said that the massaging action might be the catalyst for stimulating hair growth. “Scalp massaging can help increase hair thickness by stretching the cells of hair follicles, which then stimulates the follicles to produce thicker hair,” says Gaboardi. Never apply rosemary oil to inflamed or broken skin, adds Passam.</p>



<h2>How do you use rosemary oil for hair growth? </h2>



<p>Aside from diluting it, not all rosemary oil formulas are created equal. Though skeptical about using rosemary oil as a hair growth treatment altogether, Passam suggests it’s best applied as a leave-in product so that it has a greater chance of exerting its effects. “I would always recommend using rosemary oil in conjunction with other products [such as shampoos and serums] that support hair growth,” adds Gaboardi, who says a balanced diet and supplementation are key.</p>



<p>Though plenty of new videos are surfacing to set the record straight, the misinformation that’s being bandied about on TikTok is exactly what’s causing <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hair-care-products-you-dont-need"">concern among experts</a>. Lack of education aside, many don’t look at the root of the problem. “As a trichologist, my main concern would be that people may follow these trends when they would be better served finding out the reason for their hair loss and addressing this under the guidance of a specialist,” says Passam. “Some types of hair loss are progressive, so seeking appropriate advice early is likely to lead to better outcomes,” she adds.</p>



<p>This isn’t to say that rosemary oil doesn’t have a place in your haircare routine, but more research is needed to understand whether it can really promote hair growth and density. For now, quality control and education is your best bet to determine whether you might want to try it out for yourself.</p>

<p><strong><em>Mild spoilers ahead. </em></strong><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/06/11022903/metaverse-concerts-charlie-xcx-experience"">Charli XCX </a>hates being famous. She’s also terrified of becoming irrelevant. She loves pop music but couldn’t care less about being a pop star. She thinks the word “cunt” is cool, but “bitch” is cringe. Well, at least this is the <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/charli_xcx/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Charli XCX</a> we see in <em><a href=""https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6932fa7fbd8651ab9260fa08"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Moment</a>, </em>a satirical mockumentary that takes aim at the music industry, standom, and how both treat the artists at their center. As a heightened version of herself in the Aidan Zamiri-directed film, Charli XCX is at once a decisive musician who knows exactly what her image should be, and a distressed pop pawn torn between label requests and capitalistic endeavors to turn her viral “brat summer” into a booming brand. <em>The Moment, </em>which premiered this weekend at the <a href=""https://festival.sundance.org/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sundance Film Festival</a> in Park City, Utah, finds Charli XCX at a crossroads; she’s ready to say goodbye to her seminal <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charli-xcx-brat-green-color-trend-fashion-history"">2024 album </a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charli-xcx-brat-green-color-trend-fashion-history"">Brat</a></em> but anxious about what comes after your entire career has been whittled into a neon(ish) shade of green and an indescribable aesthetic. What happens when you become a punchline? </p>



<p>The answer, according to Charli and the team behind A24’s <em>The Moment</em>, is to start making the jokes yourself. <em><a href=""https://a24films.com/films/the-moment"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Moment</a></em> is at its best when it doesn’t take itself seriously, when it leans into being a searing commentary on fame and stardom, and when it makes fun of <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/music/what-is-brat-summer-charli-xcx-rcna163061"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Brat Summer,</a> a concept that (aside from the music, which was very good) already feels like it was a fever dream/ recession indicator of a lost era, even though it was just about 20 months ago. Brat Summer existed in the “post-pandemic” rarified space of hopefulness America seemed to have before Trump was re-elected, when partying was back, and our feeds felt less dystopian. Lest we forget, a core tenet of the <em>Brat</em> era was that it was <em>fun</em>, and for the most part, <em>The Moment </em>is too. The film takes us back to 2024, right before Charli XCX is to tour the album, when the <em>Brat</em> phenomenon is on its last legs. The film is ruthless in its depiction of record execs, the business side of the music industry, and the commodification of artists — as it should be. As her image is being chopped, skewed, and sold for parts, Charli (a genuinely good actor) toggles between aloof disinterest and manic frustration. So how much of the real Charli XCX is in <em>The Moment</em>? </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> The fact that it’s all a performance is very telling. I think the tension lies in trying to find out the truth. Do you ever know anyone? Every day people are performing who they are, and this movie is a commentary on that.</p><cite>‘the moment’ co-star Tish Weinstock</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“The thing about Charli is… she’s so authentically herself, and she’s not afraid to open up and show you all the moving parts inside of her,” Charli’s <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DT6hyP2j6XQ/?igsh=ZDJncThtaGFzcnpi"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">co-star, Isaac Powell</a>, said on the <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7599017448859258143"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sundance red carpet</a> at the premiere of <em>The Moment. </em>“I felt like I got to know the real [Charli] and you’ll see the real her in this movie. She’s an open book. I don’t think anyone will be surprised by anything.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956250.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>The most surprising thing about<em> The Moment</em> isn’t who Charli is — or isn’t — pretending to be, but who she says she’s not. Charli XCX isn’t the kind of pop star who likes pyrotechnics or stunts where she’s suspended in the air wearing sparkles and harnessed to an apparatus. Sound familiar? Charli XCX is probably never going to confirm or deny if the jabs at packaged pop princesses that are made in the film are direct hits on <a href=""https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/charli-xcx-taylor-swift-feud-explained-1235440158/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Taylor Swift (who allegedly dissed Charli</a> on her most recent album), but it was surprising to me how unsubtle they were. Swift has produced many over-the-top concert films. When a trailer for Charli XCX’s fake music film drops in <em>The Moment</em>, it looks like it’s ripped from the Disney Plus discover page trying to redirect you to watch the <a href=""https://www.disneyplus.com/?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;cid=DSS-Search-Google-23350434458-&amp;s_kwcid=AL!8468!3!787715553960!e!!g!!189444688026-2455688837471&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=23350434458&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACzWEUHHGgWvGnLHGCqxuKWhArkTx&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAvtzLBhCPARIsALwhxdqO-p34rCejad6X0vz-Gz_Qxm-qo8cguVDAhjg4hIHRvBoEcdsP-jIaAiQTEALw_wcB"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Eras Tour.</a> It’s very Swift-coded to say the least. But Swift isn’t the only pop star to make a concert doc, and she’s not the only one who dons a sequinned mic and suspends in the air over her fans during her acts. She’s not the only billionaire poster child for how pop music has become a marketing machine more concerned with bottom lines than quality music. It could just be a coincidence, right?  — or Charli XCX and Taylor Swift are engaged in a pop star petty-off. I, for one, am here for it. If Swift can (allegedly) throw shots at Charli XCX, why shouldn’t she shoot back? </p>

Courtesy of Sundance Institute.</figcaption></figure>



<p><em>The Moment</em> star <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tishweinstock/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tish Weinstock</a> said the confusion over what is a performance and what’s not in the film is the point. “The fact that it’s all a performance is very telling,” Weinstock said at the premiere. “I think the tension lies in trying to find out the truth. Do you ever know anyone? Every day people are performing who they are, and this movie is a commentary on that.”</p>



<p>Charli’s performance of who she is in<em> The Moment </em>isn’t always a flattering one. When she blows off her creative director (played excellently by Hailey Benton Gates, giving a nuanced, exasperated yet restrained performance that sometimes outshines its material) in the middle of tour rehearsals to go to a wellness spa in Ibiza, Charli XCX is being a brat — and not in the coked-out, absurdist chic way she intended. Charli is running from fame, and she runs into <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/kylie-jenner"">Kylie Jenner,</a> naturally (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DT6vs4eEeix/?igsh=MTg1OGpld3hwa2Mxbw=="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Rachel Sennott</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tiktok-ugly-trend-julia-fox-feminism"">Julia Fox</a> also deliver strong cameos). It’s a bit on the nose to include a Kardashian, the first family of being famous for fame’s sake, but somehow it works. Jenner surprisingly holds her own while presumably also playing a heightened version of herself. She’s passive aggressively pissed at Charli for stealing the in-demand director Kylie and her sister (she didn’t specify which one) wanted for their own project. This causes Charli to spiral, and to call her team demanding they give the hotshot director, who has been tapped for Charli’s concert film, anything he wants. The director, Johannes, is played by <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/article/lets-all-be-normal-about-alexander-skarsgards-sexuality"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Alexander Skarsgärd</a> who is having the <em>time of his life</em> in this role.</p>



<p>Johannes acts as a stand-in for all the shitty men women in music have to deal with, the ones who condescend, belittle, mansplain, and gaslight. He does all that cloaked in therapy speak and bad clothes. Skarsgärd is truly hilarious — albeit disturbing — in the role. It’s in the scenes with Johannes, the gaggle of other bros, and Rosanna Arquette’s clueless record executive, who each are attempting to sell, monopolize and destroy Charli’s image, that the movie finds its footing. The movie is a ridiculous takedown of how silly this industry is, and how unserious Brat Summer was. When she’s at her most self-deprecating, <em>The Moment</em>’s Charli XCX is extremely likeable, and the world she’s critiquing is all about extremes. </p>



<p>“Fame is sacrificing your privacy but also getting everything that you want,” Weinstock said when asked to describe fame and the film’s explanation of it. “Deal with it.” </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956254.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>As Charli XCX deals with it, she’s grappling with having it all while wanting none of it. The last act of the film could be interpreted as a sincere rumination on the mental toil of massive success, and the loss of creative freedom, but it’s also where the movie’s message gets muddled. It may seem hard to feel bad for someone who got everything she wanted, but the genuine emotions that Charli the actress delivers help you root for this anti-heroine, even when you’re rooting for her multi-million dollar <em>Brat</em> credit card deal not to fall through. The viewer gets just as caught up in the allure of Chari XCX as the parasocial stans she’s referencing. But Charli XCX is taking the piss out of herself, her fans, and their co-dependency. She can leave the sincerity for the sparkly pop stars. </p>



<p><a href=""https://deadline.com/2026/01/the-moment-review-charli-xcx-sundance-1236690970/""><em>Deadline called The Moment</em></a><em> </em>a “spiritual sequel to <em>Spice World</em>” and I’ll go further and call it<em> Spice World </em>meets <em>Uncut Gems. </em>Complimentary! Ultimately, Charli XCX’s fans will love her irreverent approach and newcomers will be endeared by her self awareness. There’s a scene near the beginning of the film where Charli asks one of her team members if something related to Brat Summer was too cringe. They reply, “It’s all cringe.” Making a meta anti-concert film to say goodbye to an era that had cable news debating whether the Vice President was “brat” is a little cringe. <em>The Moment’s</em> Charli XCX would lean into it. Sure, it’s all cringe, but cringe sells, and that’s all that matters. </p>

<p>R29 babes, the week opens under the influence of a first quarter moon in Taurus on January 25th, a moment that often brings the first real tests of the intentions we set at the Capricorn New Moon one week earlier. First quarter moons tend to surface friction, delays, or reality checks that ask us to adjust rather than abandon our goals. In Taurus, those roadblocks can feel especially personal, touching on money, security, self-worth, or comfort.</p>



<p>The shadow here is digging in too hard, insisting it’s your way or the highway, or confusing stability with stubbornness. But the gift of this lunation is learning how to stay committed without becoming rigid. Progress now comes from flexibility, patience, and choosing long-term alignment over short-term control. </p>



<p>The most defining shift of the week arrives on January 26th at 12:34 p.m. EST, when Neptune enters Aries, beginning a brand-new thirteen-year chapter for the collective. This marks a major transition away from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/neptune-retrograde-in-aries-pisces-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Neptune in Pisces</a>, which emphasized dreaming, dissolving, and spiritual sensitivity since 2011, sometimes without follow- through. Neptune in Aries is about initiating the dream, embodying it, and fighting for a vision rather than passively hoping for one. We’re moving out of the influencer era and deeper into a protagonist era, where more people feel called to live their own stories instead of consuming someone else’s. </p>



<p>On a global level, this transit carries weight. Aries is ruled by Mars, and Neptune here can inspire movements, conflicts, and ideological battles driven by belief as much as reality. The shadow is dreaming up chaos, glorifying dominance, or leaders competing to prove who is strongest, especially as Saturn prepares to join Neptune in Aries next month. The invitation, both personally and collectively, is to dream new worlds responsibly. To believe in yourself enough to take action without turning that fire into destruction. To choose courage without self-sabotage, and passion without violence. </p>



<p>The week closes by pointing us toward what comes next. February begins with a fiery Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, a striking contrast to the Earth, Air, and Water-heavy energy that has dominated January. Where January opened with a cleansing <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cancer-new-moon-horoscope-2026-meaning-effects"">Cancer Full Moon</a>, February begins with bold, expressive fire. This Leo Full Moon illuminates confidence, creativity, leadership, and the desire to be seen. At its best, it reminds us that playing small no longer serves anyone, and that joy, pride, and self-expression are not selfish. </p>



<p>The shadow of this full moon is ego, control, or needing all eyes on you at the expense of others. The work is finding the balance between honoring your needs and remembering that true leadership inspires rather than dominates. This Full Moon asks one simple but powerful question as we move forward: where are you finally ready to take up space, unapologetically and with heart? </p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, welcome to your main character era, officially unlocked. This week marks the start of one of the most important transits of your lifetime as Neptune enters your sign on January 26th, where it’ll remain for the next thirteen years. This is huge. Neptune in Aries is about turning dreams into action, and for you, it feels like the universe handing you the creative director chair of your own life. Your intuition sharpens, your vision expands, and suddenly the future feels less abstract and more achievable. You’re being asked to dream boldly and act bravely, but the challenge is staying grounded while you do it.</p>



<p>Neptune can blur lines, so there may be moments where you feel invincible one minute and impatient the next when things do not move fast enough. Pace yourself. Manifestation is not a sprint. When you pair faith with follow-through, your ability to bring your dreams to life is far stronger now than it was even a few weeks ago. </p>



<p>The fire only intensifies as the week leads into a Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, lighting up your sector of fate, romance, creativity, and joy. This is a chef’s-kiss moment for self-expression, passion projects, and heart-led decisions. You may experience a breakthrough in love, feel seen for your talents, or finally give yourself permission to take up more space without apology. </p>



<p>At its best, this Full Moon reminds you that you deserve a life that excites you. The shadow of this lunation, however, is assuming everything should go your way instantly or taking setbacks personally. Confidence is magnetic, but entitlement blocks the flow. Let this Full Moon fuel your courage, not your ego. When you stay open, playful, and patient, this fiery week sets the tone for a powerful, purpose-driven chapter ahead. </p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, this week is quietly powerful, even if it doesn’t scream for attention at first. With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Neptune entering Aries</a> on January 26th, your subconscious, rest, and healing sector is activated for the next thirteen years. This is less about loud manifestation and more about deep internal rewiring. Old fears, patterns, and self-sabotaging habits are ready to dissolve, but only if you are willing to slow down and listen to what your inner world has been trying to say. </p>



<p>Dreams may feel more vivid, intuition stronger, and your need for rest more non-negotiable. The magic here is subtle but real. When you give yourself permission to unplug, heal, and trust your instincts, you are laying the foundation for a future version of yourself that feels lighter, clearer, and more aligned. </p>



<p>The energy peaks with the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, illuminating your home, family, and emotional foundations sector. This can bring a turning point around living situations, family dynamics, or your sense of belonging. You may feel ready to take up more space in your personal life or finally advocate for what you need emotionally. </p>



<p>The shadow of this Full Moon is reacting from pride or stubbornness instead of vulnerability. Not every battle needs to be won, and not every feeling needs to be defended. Let this moment remind you that strength can look like softness too. When you balance emotional honesty with flexibility, this week helps you feel more secure, rooted, and at peace with where you are headed.  </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, your social life and long-term dreams are entering a whole new era. With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Neptune entering Aries</a> on January 26th, your friendship, community, and future-goals sector gets a major glow up that lasts for the next thirteen years. This transit invites you to dream bigger about the kind of people you want around you and the impact you want to make. </p>



<p>During Neptune in Aries, you may feel inspired to build something meaningful with others, whether that’s a creative collective, a business idea, or a cause you actually care about. The magic here is believing in the vision without losing yourself in it. Neptune can blur boundaries, so be mindful of overcommitting or idealizing people who have not shown consistency yet. Dream big, but choose your circle wisely. </p>



<p>The week crescendos with the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, lighting up your communication, ideas, and self-expression sector. This is a powerful moment for speaking your truth, sharing your work, or finally saying the thing you have been holding back. Confidence is high, creativity is flowing, and your voice carries extra weight right now. </p>



<p>The shadow side of this Full Moon is talking just to be heard or letting ego override empathy. Let this Full Moon remind you that your words have power. When you speak from the heart instead of the highlight reel, people actually listen. This is your moment to be seen and heard, just make sure it’s for the right reasons. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955474.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cancer, this week marks a major turning point in how you dream about your future and your role in the world. With Neptune entering Aries on January 26th, your career, purpose, and public image sector is activated for the next thirteen years. This is big. You are being invited to envision a version of success that feels meaningful, intuitive, and aligned with who you actually are, not just what is expected of you.</p>



<p>Under Neptune in Aries, you may feel more inspired about your path, but also more sensitive to whether your work truly reflects your values. The magic here is learning to trust your vision while staying grounded in reality. Neptune can blur lines, so avoid romanticizing a role, title, or opportunity without checking whether it’s sustainable. When you pair intuition with discernment, your dreams become achievable rather than overwhelming. </p>



<p>The energy peaks with the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, lighting up your money, self-worth, and abundance sector. This Full Moon asks you to own your value without shrinking or over-explaining. You may experience a financial breakthrough, a confidence boost, or a moment where you finally realize you deserve more than you’ve been settling for. </p>



<p>The shadow side of this Full Moon is tying your worth too tightly to external validation or spending impulsively to prove a point. Let this Full Moon remind you that abundance starts with self-trust. When you believe in yourself unapologetically, others follow your lead. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, this week is quietly redefining what expansion and purpose mean for you on a soul level. With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Neptune entering Aries</a> on January 26th, your sector of travel, higher learning, spirituality, and belief systems is activated for the next thirteen years. Translation: your worldview is about to get a serious upgrade. You may feel called to explore new philosophies, spiritual practices, creative studies, or even literal new places. </p>



<p>Neptune in Aries is a long-term invitation to dream bigger about your life and trust that growth does not always come from staying comfortable. The challenge here is staying grounded while you explore. Neptune can blur direction, so it is important to stay curious without getting lost in fantasy. Think inspired, not impulsive. </p>



<p>Then comes the moment you were born for. The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st lands in your identity and self-expression sector, putting you front and center. This is a powerful checkpoint around confidence, visibility, and authenticity. You may feel ready to claim space, be seen, or finally stop dimming yourself for the comfort of others. </p>



<p>At its best, this Full Moon reminds you that you deserve to lead with heart and creativity. The shadow of the Full Moon in your sign is falling victim to ego overload, control issues, or needing constant validation. Let this be a moment of embodied confidence rather than performance. When you show up as your real self, not just the highlight reel, your light hits different. </p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Virgo, this week marks the start of a deep, transformative era that asks you to trust what you cannot fully control. With Neptune entering Aries on January 26th, your sector of intimacy, shared resources, and emotional merging is activated for the next thirteen years. This is about redefining how you share, trust, and open yourself up, financially, emotionally, and energetically. You may feel more sensitive around boundaries or more aware of where you’ve been over-giving. The magic here is learning that vulnerability does not equal weakness. The challenge is staying clear-eyed while you open your heart. Neptune can blur lines, so honesty, transparency, and self-trust are essential as you step into deeper connections and commitments. </p>



<p>The energy peaks with the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, illuminating your rest, healing, and subconscious sector. This Full Moon invites you to slow down and listen to what your body and spirit have been trying to tell you. You may experience emotional releases, vivid dreams, or a realization about what you are ready to let go of. </p>



<p>The shadow of the Leo Full Moon is ignoring the need for rest or trying to “optimize” your healing instead of feeling it. Let this moment remind you that renewal does not come from doing more. When you honor rest as part of your process, you emerge clearer, stronger, and more aligned for what comes next. </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Libra, this week oﬃcially changes the way you approach love, partnership, and commitment for the long haul. With Neptune entering Aries on January 26th, your relationship sector is activated for the next thirteen years. Yes, thirteen. This is a major reimagining of how you connect, collaborate, and share your life with others. You may feel more romantic, idealistic, or hopeful about love and partnership, but Neptune also asks for discernment.</p>



<p>The magic of this transit is believing in deep, soul-aligned connections without losing yourself in them. The challenge is not projecting fantasies onto people who have not shown up consistently. Over the next chapter, you are learning that true partnership supports your independence rather than replacing it. </p>



<p>The energy peaks with the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, lighting up your friendship, community, and long-term goals sector. This Full Moon brings clarity around who is really in your corner and which connections energize your future. You may feel ready to step into leadership within a group, celebrate a collective win, or finally distance yourself from social dynamics that feel draining. </p>



<p>The shadow side of this moon is people-pleasing or craving approval instead of honoring your truth. Let this Full Moon remind you that belonging does not require shrinking. When you show up authentically, the right people naturally rise to meet you. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, this week is about redefining what it means to show up for your life on a daily basis. With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Neptune entering Aries</a> on January 26th, your work, wellness, and routine sector is activated for the next thirteen years. This is a long-term invitation to stop running on autopilot and start aligning your everyday life with your deeper values. You may feel more sensitive to burnout, uninspired routines, or work that drains you without meaning. </p>



<p>The magic of Neptune in Aries is learning to design a life that supports your energy, not just your ambition. However, you should beware of falling prey to escapism or avoiding structure altogether. Neptune wants flow, but Aries demands action. The sweet spot is intuitive discipline, building habits that feel purposeful rather than punishing. </p>



<p>The energy crescendos with the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, lighting up your career, reputation, and public image sector. This can bring a moment of recognition, visibility, or clarity around your professional direction. You may feel ready to step into leadership or finally own your authority. </p>



<p>The shadow of the Leo Full Moon is getting caught up in power struggles, ego clashes, or feeling pressure to perform instead of lead authentically. Let this Full Moon remind you that confidence does not require domination. When you lead from integrity and emotional intelligence, your presence speaks louder than control ever could. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, this week flips a major creative switch for you. With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Neptune entering Aries</a> on January 26, your sector of joy, romance, creativity, and self-expression is activated for the next thirteen years. Yes, thirteen. This is huge main-character energy around doing what lights you up and actually believing you deserve a life that feels inspiring. </p>



<p>You may feel more artistically driven, more romantic, or more willing to take risks for the sake of passion rather than practicality. The magic of this auspicious transit is trusting your creative instincts and letting play be productive. The shadow is chasing dopamine instead of fulfillment or romanticizing something that does not have real substance. Dream big, but stay honest with yourself about what is truly nourishing versus just exciting. </p>



<p>The week builds toward the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, lighting up your travel, growth, and belief sector. This Full Moon can bring a breakthrough around purpose, perspective, or a bold decision about your future. You may feel ready to say yes to an opportunity that expands your world or finally let go of a belief that has been keeping you small. </p>



<p>The potential pitfalls of this full moon is thinking you have all the answers or pushing your truth onto others. Let this moment remind you that wisdom grows when curiosity stays alive. When you lead with openness and confidence, the next chapter unfolds naturally. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, this week marks the beginning of a deeply emotional and transformative era around home, family, and your inner foundation. With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Neptune entering Aries</a> on January 26th, your sector of roots, living situation, and emotional security is activated for the next thirteen years. This is not surface-level change. You’re being asked to reimagine what “home” means to you, not just physically, but emotionally and energetically. </p>



<p>With this new Neptune era, you may feel more sensitive to your environment, family dynamics, or where you truly feel safe. The magic of Neptune in Aries is learning that stability does not have to be rigid. The challenge is not escaping discomfort by staying busy or emotionally distant. Over this long chapter, you are learning how to build a life that feels supportive from the inside out, not just impressive from the outside. </p>



<p>The energy peaks with the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, lighting up your sector of intimacy, shared resources, and emotional vulnerability. This Full Moon asks you to go deeper rather than harder. Conversations around trust, money, or emotional honesty may come to a head, oﬀering clarity about what needs to shift. </p>



<p>The shadow side of this lunation is control, pride, or trying to manage feelings instead of feeling them. Let this moment remind you that real power comes from allowing yourself to be supported too. When you soften where you normally armor up, you create space for deeper connection and long-term healing. </p>

<p>Aquarius, your mind is entering a whole new era. With Neptune entering Aries on January 26th, your communication, ideas, and mindset sector is activated for the next thirteen years. This is big “thought leader” energy. Your words, ideas, and perspectives carry more imagination, influence, and emotional resonance than before. You may feel inspired to write, teach, speak, create content, or share ideas that feel deeply personal and purpose-driven.</p>



<p>The magic that Neptune in Aries brings is learning to trust your voice without over-editing yourself. The shadow is confusion, overthinking, or starting ten ideas without grounding any of them. Neptune wants vision, Aries wants action. When you commit to one idea at a time, your message actually lands. </p>



<p>The week culminates with the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, lighting up your relationship sector and bringing clarity to one-on-one dynamics. This Full Moon puts a spotlight on partnerships, situationships, collaborations, and even creative rivals. You may realize who is truly cheering you on and who feels more competitive than supportive. </p>



<p>The danger of this full moon is making everything about ego or control, either yours or someone else’s. Let this moment remind you that the best relationships celebrate individuality without turning love into a power struggle. When mutual respect leads, everything else falls into place. </p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, this week marks a major turning point in how you build security, confidence, and self-worth. With Neptune, your ruling planet, entering Aries on January 26th, your money, values, and self-esteem sector is activated for the next thirteen years. This is huge. You’re being asked to stop romanticizing struggle and start believing that you can be both spiritual and supported. You may feel inspired to pursue new income streams, charge what you are worth, or redefine what stability looks like for you.</p>



<p>The magic of Neptune transiting Aries is trusting that you deserve more than survival mode. The shadow side of this transit is drifting, underpricing yourself, or hoping things will “just work out” without action. Neptune brings vision, but Aries demands courage. When you back your dreams with initiative, your relationship with abundance begins to change for real. </p>



<p>The week builds toward the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, lighting up your work, wellness, and daily routines sector. This Full Moon shines a light on how you are showing up for yourself day to day. You may realize that certain habits, commitments, or work dynamics are no longer sustainable. </p>



<p>But beware, Pisces, as this Full Moon could lead to you pushing through exhaustion for the sake of proving something. The breakthrough comes when you choose self-respect over self-sacrifice. Let this Full Moon remind you that you do not have to earn rest or care. When your daily life supports your energy, everything else flows more easily.</p>
