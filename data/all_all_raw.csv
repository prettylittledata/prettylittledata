<p>Designing an interior is, in many ways, an exercise in orchestration. Just as a conductor coordinates instruments, timbres, rhythms, and intensities to compose a coherent piece, the architect brings together materials, color, light, texture, and proportion to define the spatial quality and atmosphere of an environment. None of these decisions operates in isolation: the choice of a surface influences how light is reflected; a given material can shape how a room ages over time; <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com.br/br/935034/como-as-cores-alteram-a-percepcao-dos-espacos-interiores"">color</a>, in turn, directly affects the perception of scale.</p>",

<h4>AI assistants don’t have to communicate in paragraphs. They can communicate through interfaces.</h4><figure><img alt=""A paper cutout illustration showing an AI assistant chat interface on the left connected to a design system library on the right."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ec6csH34-8uaTEWIkXZ6Gg.png"" /><figcaption>Generated using Google Gemini</figcaption></figure><p>LLMs have made AI assistants a standard feature across SaaS. AI assistants allow users to instantly retrieve information and interact with a system through text-based prompts. Mathias Biilmann, in his article “<a href=""https://biilmann.blog/articles/introducing-ax/"">Introducing AX: Why Agent Experience Matters</a>,” discusses two distinct approaches to building AI assistants. The Closed Approach involves a conversational assistant embedded directly within a single SaaS product. Examples include Zoom’s AI Companion, Salesforce CRM’s Einstein, and Microsoft’s Copilot. The Open Approach involves external conversational assistants, such as Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini, which are being supercharged via protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol). This protocol allows the AI assistants to connect to and interact with various third-party SaaS products, effectively making a company’s product accessible to external assistants and agents.</p><h3>The risk of commoditization</h3><p>Both approaches are powerful. They offer users flexibility they’ve never had. However, they also reduce the carefully crafted user experience to a purely text-based interface. When the interaction is text-only and detached from your product, the user experience is no longer a differentiator, and your <a href=""https://www.pragmaticcoders.com/blog/saas-is-dead-how-ai-agents-reduced-saas-to-just-an-api"">product is at risk of becoming a commodity</a>.</p><p>Text-only interfaces also limit interactions to simple information retrieval and basic CRUD operations, making complex workflows difficult. This <a href=""https://artium.ai/insights/beyond-chat-how-ai-is-transforming-ui-design-patterns"">creates limitations</a> as users attempt to consume large amounts of information and execute complex operations solely through text prompts. Andrej Karpathy, in his recent piece<a href=""https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/year-in-review-2025/""> 2025 LLM Year in Review</a>, noted that while text is the favored format for computers and LLMs, it is not for humans. We humans prefer information visually. Similarly, Maximillian Piras in 2024, argued that <a href=""https://uxmag.com/articles/when-words-cannot-describe-designing-for-ai-beyond-conversational-interfaces"">chat is often a poor fit for complex interaction patterns</a>.</p><h3>The temptation of generative UI</h3><p>One answer gaining traction is generative UI where the AI autonomously creates interfaces based on the user’s prompts. While this capability is likely to improve significantly, it also presents a risk of delivering generic experiences. Without designer input, AI-generated UX defaults to the generic average of its training data. Every product starts looking the same. There is no differentiation. Dorian Tireli describes how <a href=""https://poplab.io/commoditization-saas-design-ai/"">AI is reinforcing mediocrity</a> due to training data coming from common design platforms that are optimized for visual appeal.</p><h3>The case for design system integration</h3><p>As a result, we need to examine an alternate approach, one where the AI assistants have knowledge of a product’s unique design system — its components, patterns, and guidelines. Any time the user prompts, instead of displaying text blocks and paragraphs, what if the assistant could render rich interfaces supplied by the product’s design system? This transforms the chat from a static text box into a dynamic viewport with rich interactive elements. The <a href=""https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-01-26-mcp-apps/"">latest developments</a> in the MCP protocol are making this approach possible.</p><figure><img alt=""Flow diagram showing a user prompting the AI assistant which then communicates with the Design System that returns a UI component. The UI component is then rendered to the user as a response."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/714/1*jRw1B92fdpVGV7Tw_D_DLA.png"" /><figcaption>Designed using Figma</figcaption></figure><h3>Three modes for richer AI experiences</h3><p>To create richer and differentiated experiences, I have considered three different design modes that can help us move beyond the text-trap.</p><h4>Mode 1: Rich output</h4><p>In complex business applications, users consume data, not just answers. Large blocks of text create cognitive load. The challenge is to move beyond text and towards a richer UI output. For example, when a user prompts “Merge the two John Smith records flagged yesterday,” the AI doesn’t ask “Which one should be primary?” Instead, it displays two contact cards side-by-side with metadata, enabling the user to make a decision through the UI. This approach maximizes scannability and allows the user to instantly grasp the situation and prioritize follow-up.</p><figure><img alt=""AI assistant displaying two contact cards for the user to choose between using visual cues."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/872/1*M0bgD1X-TCn5hFBfSC4coQ.png"" /><figcaption>Designed using Figma Make</figcaption></figure><h4>Mode 2: UI as input</h4><p>The differentiated experience must start at the point of input, not just output. Rather than forcing users to craft precise text prompts and requiring them to know the exact parameters to provide, imagine if the AI assistant could replace the text box with a structured input component. For example, when a user wants to retrieve a record, instead of typing “Show me California leads with high activity” and then requiring the user to re-prompt every time they want to add more parameters, the AI assistant simply displays a query builder.</p><figure><img alt=""AI assistant displaying a filter UI, making it easier for the user to choose parameters as opposed to having to type a detailed query."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/872/1*qXe8NrqwVlPjifV34woP3g.png"" /><figcaption>Designed using Figma Make</figcaption></figure><p>This shift from text to high-fidelity input removes ambiguity, reduces back-and-forth, and makes the overall interaction faster and more precise.</p><h4>Mode 3: Co-creation</h4><p>Modes 1 and 2 represent single interactions. But real-world scenarios are rarely this simple. In SaaS applications, high-value tasks are multi-step workflows. Creating a marketing automation campaign. Building a complex report. Configuring an integration. These aren’t things you accomplish in one prompt, rather they unfold over a conversation where the user and AI assistant refine the work together.</p><p>To support this, the AI assistant needs to become more than a responder. <strong>It needs to become a workspace.</strong></p><p>Let’s see how this plays out through a single scenario: a user creating a marketing automation campaign. The user prompts: “Create a campaign for trial users who haven’t activated yet.” The AI responds by rendering a flow builder component showing a draft campaign.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows a flow generated by the AI assistant based on the user’s prompt. The user asked the AI assistant to create campaign for trial users who haven’t activated yet."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pJjd37QJ5eFZNFj_L8ektA.png"" /><figcaption>Made using Figma</figcaption></figure><p>From here, <strong>four capabilities</strong> transform a back-and-forth conversation into a co-creation model.</p><p><strong>Fluid modality switching<br /></strong>When the user wants to update a block, they shouldn’t be forced back to the text prompt. The AI assistant should allow users to move fluidly between text and direct manipulation. For example, rather than prompting “change the wait time to 5 days,” the user simply adjusts the wait component directly in the flow builder. The AI validates the change and updates dependent elements automatically.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows the flow components rendered by the AI assistant. The user directly interacts with the UI elements and updates the flow as opposed to asking the AI assistant to make changes."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3W3npKqeOz42lXXqZf1JNw.png"" /><figcaption>(Made using Figma)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Proactive cross-tool suggestions<br /></strong>Complex workflows often span multiple tools and users need information from various sources to take better decisions. Rather than forcing the user to start a new conversation or open a new tab, the AI assistant can bring data from connected tools directly into the workflow. Better yet, it can surface insights proactively.</p><p>In our example, once the flow has been created, the AI notices that most unactivated users are on mobile, while the email templates are desktop-focused. Without being prompted, it pulls usage data from the connected analytics tool and surfaces a brief insight within the flow builder: “68% of your unactivated trial users are on mobile, but your email templates aren’t mobile-optimized.”</p><figure><img alt=""The GIF shows the AI assistant proactively displaying insights from relevant tools and sources. As the user is updating the flow, the AI assistant pulls data from an analytics tool and informs that user that most of the unactivated users are on mobile whereas all the email templates in the flow are web based."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8GVVr2klWv6iLVqViVYPWg.gif"" /><figcaption>(Created using Figma and Figma Make)</figcaption></figure><p>For this to work, the AI assistant needs the right level of access to the data. But access alone isn’t enough. The judgment layer needs to be designed to know when an insight is worth surfacing and when silence is the better choice.</p><p><strong>Delegation of discrete subtasks<br /></strong>At some point in a multi-step workflow, the user may want to hand off a contained piece of work entirely. Based on the mobile optimization insight, the user prompts the AI assistant to update the template. The AI assistant then takes on the content work while the user continues refining the campaign’s structural logic. When ready, the AI surfaces the updated template for review. This is <strong>co-creation as division of labor</strong>, not just turn-taking.</p><figure><img alt=""Once the user accepts the AI assistant’s recommendation, the assistant goes to work on this sub-task while the user can continue to do their work. The assistant keeps the user informed on the progress and the user can take an informed decision."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ggzbqGj4XsiUp5r3gbaJgQ.gif"" /><figcaption>(Made using Figma and Figma Make)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Contextually refine with text<br /></strong> The text-based input doesn’t have to live in the prompt box — it can be contextual to the UI elements. For example, the user hovers over a connector in the flow and prompts, “Send a survey asking about their biggest challenge, then route them to different content tracks based on their answer.” In response, the AI inserts a new survey block before the final reminder email block, creates conditional branches based on common responses, and shows the multi-path workflow.</p><p>Because the prompt was anchored to a specific component rather than being in the generic prompt box, the AI understands where in the workflow the user is acting, not just what they’re saying. The library, Shape of AI by Emily Campbell highlights <a href=""https://www.shapeof.ai/patterns/inline-action"">Inline action</a> as way for user to adjust or respond to a small part of a larger piece of content.</p><figure><img alt=""This image shows the user prompting the AI assistant in context of the UI. The user clicks one of the nodes in the flow and asks the AI assistant to update the flow."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_q961WZJ3qbWUVUl5VF_Sg.gif"" /><figcaption>(Made using Figma and Figma Make)</figcaption></figure><p>In Mode 3, rather than forcing users into turn-by-turn conversations, the AI assistant becomes an added modality for the product’s experience. It holds context across tools so the user doesn’t have to. It creates <strong>a shared workspace for co-creation</strong> so the user and AI assistant can work together.</p><h3>The craft hasn’t changed</h3><p>While designing for AI assistants and AI agents may sound daunting at first, the good news is that the <a href=""https://www.salesforce.com/blog/ai-design-skills/"">skills required to succeed aren’t novel</a>. They’re the same fundamentals that have always distinguished exceptional designers.</p><p>You need a deep understanding of users and jobs-to-be-done to identify which tasks actually benefit from conversational AI. Systems thinking is quickly becoming one of the most important skills as highlighted in these articles from <a href=""https://www.salesforce.com/blog/ai-jobs-to-be-done-designers/#h-five-ways-design-work-is-shifting-and-how-to-respond"">Salesforce</a> and <a href=""https://adobe.design/stories/leading-design/six-human-skills-that-will-future-proof-your-design-career"">Adobe</a>. You need systems thinking, because these assistants cross boundaries, within your product’s IA and beyond it into other tools. And you need technical literacy: data models, APIs, backend logic. When users can query any data the system touches, you’d better understand what that data looks like.</p><p>AI assistants and agents are only going to keep increasing. The question isn’t whether your product will have one, it’s whether the experience will be differentiated or commoditized.</p><p>The text-trap is real, but it’s not inevitable.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=7035bbc4aaa5"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/ais-text-trap-moving-towards-a-more-interactive-future-7035bbc4aaa5"">AI’s text-trap: Moving towards a more interactive future</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

As a Product Manager in healthcare, I was taught that “habit formation” was the holy grail. We ask: <em>Can our product change people’s habits?</em> But after analyzing 83 artifacts spanning from 7000 BC to 2024, I’ve realized habits are just the symptoms. The “Vibe” is the cause. We treat breakthroughs in fasting, sleep, and gut health as “disruptions.” They aren’t. They are <strong>translations</strong> of ancient practices rendered acceptable through contemporary measurement, automation, and a very specific kind of storytelling.</p><h3>The methodology: vibe coding</h3><p>Archaeologists read pottery shards to understand ancient civilizations — why this glaze, why this shape, why buried here? <strong>Vibe coding</strong> reads product design patterns to decode the invisible architecture of our moment.</p><p>I examined 83 artifacts across four domains (fasting, movement, sleep, gut health) spanning 9,000 years. Each artifact — from <a href=""https://www.worldhistory.org/Neolithic_Period/"">Neolithic globular fermentation jars (7000 BC)</a> to <a href=""https://www.eightsleep.com/"">Eight Sleep Pods (2019)</a> — contains encoded information: What anxieties did it address? What authorities legitimized it? What previous solutions had failed? What I found wasn’t innovation. It was translation: the product is just the container for the story.</p><h3>The pattern: four triggers, one cycle</h3><p>Products don’t create trends; they arrive at the exact moment a convergence of triggers makes a practice culturally acceptable again. I identified four triggers that activate every preventive health resurgence:</p><ol><li><strong>Crisis (Creates Urgency):</strong> A widespread problem makes the status quo unacceptable (e.g., <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html"">1970s obesity epidemic</a> or 2020 pandemic isolation).</li><li><strong>Technology (Removes Barriers):</strong> New tools make a practice frictionless or measurable (e.g., smartphone apps or <a href=""https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/DNA-Sequencing-Costs-Data"">DNA sequencing cost collapse</a>).</li><li><strong>Authority (Reframes Legitimacy):</strong> Scientific validation or aspirational figures reframe the practice (e.g., a <a href=""https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2016/ohsumi/facts/"">Nobel Prize for autophagy</a>).</li><li><strong>Disappointment (The Vacuum):</strong> The previous “innovation” (diet pills, gym memberships) fails.</li></ol><h3>Why timing matters more than quality</h3><p>The <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.wired.com/2013/05/zeo-sleep-manager-obituary/"">Zeo Sleep Headband (2009)</a> had better technology than the <a href=""https://ouraring.com/"">Oura Ring (2015)</a> — clinical-grade EEG vs. optical sensors. It failed. Oura succeeded. Why? In 2009, only 1 trigger was present (Technology). By 2015, all 4 triggers aligned:</p><ul><li><strong>Crisis:</strong> Burnout epidemic &amp; “Sleep Recession.”</li><li><strong>Technology:</strong> Miniaturized sensors &amp; smartphone ubiquity.</li><li><strong>Authority:</strong> Matthew Walker’s bestseller <a href=""https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Why-We-Sleep/Matthew-Walker/9781501144325"">Why We Sleep</a>.</li><li><strong>Disappointment:</strong> Ambien dependency &amp; sleeping pill side effects.</li></ul><p><strong>The pattern:</strong> The Oura ring did not create the trend.

For thousands of years, these practices remained embedded in culture. Now, technology and capital move them through the “hype cycle” at breakneck speed:</p><ul><li><strong>Fermentation:</strong> 9,000 years (Traditional) → 15 years (Quantified) → 3 years (Fatigue).</li><li><strong>Fasting:</strong> Millennia (Religious) → 4 years (App Adoption) → 2 years (Pharmaceutical Replacement).</li></ul><h3>The meta-lesson: what the industry gets wrong</h3><ol><li><strong>Measurement ≠ Innovation:</strong> Measurement often creates “score anxiety” rather than health.</li><li><strong>Automation ≠ Improvement:</strong> Automation removes the “essential challenge” of developing body awareness. When the algorithm decides everything, you lose the skill of deciding for yourself.</li><li><strong>Products ≠ Trends:</strong> Building a great product is useless if the cultural pattern isn’t ready. The product is just the container for the story the culture is finally ready to hear.</li></ol><h3>The cycle accelerates</h3><p>Notice the time compression. Fermentation took 9,000 years to move from survival to science. Fasting took only four years to move from “hacker” app to a pharmaceutical injection (GLP-1s). We are approaching a <strong>pattern saturation point</strong> where cycles turn so fast that “new” products launch into immediate consumer skepticism.</p><h3>The future: 2026–2035 predictions</h3><p>Where is the “Vibe” moving next? Based on the pattern recognition from the last 83 artifacts, here is what I predict for the next decade of preventive health:</p><h4>1. The current wave crashes (2026–2028)</h4><p>We are approaching “Optimization Fatigue.” The resale market will soon flood with $2,000 bikes and $300 rings. Subscription resistance will peak — consumers will reject paying “rent” on their own health data. We will see the collapse of several “personalized nutrition” startups as users realize 40-page algorithmic reports rarely lead to actionable change.</p><h4>2. The pharmaceutical end-game (2025–2032)</h4><p><a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.novonordisk.com/our-products/obesity-care/ozempic.html"">GLP-1 drugs (Ozempic)</a> represent the Final Extraction. We have extracted the biological mechanism so thoroughly that we no longer need the practice of discipline. Expect this to follow in other domains:</p><ul><li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Orexin antagonists replacing the need for “sleep hygiene.”</li><li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Myostatin inhibitors or “exercise mimetics” — pills that mimic the metabolic benefits of a workout without the sweat.</li><li><strong>The Backlash:</strong> By 2030, a counter-movement will emerge that views this pharmaceutical path as “synthetic living,” leading to a massive resurgence in the “Authentic” phase.</li></ul><h4>3. The resurgence of dismissed practices (2027–2035)</h4><p>Whatever we currently consider “outdated” or “inefficient” is a candidate for rediscovery. Watch for:</p><ul><li><strong>Biphasic Sleep:</strong> A return to the pre-industrial “midnight awakening” as a time for meditation or creativity.</li><li><strong>Communal Labor:</strong> Movement that serves a purpose. As gym culture fades, we will see “functional fitness” return to actual functions: community gardening, building, and manual repair.</li><li><strong>Seasonal Living:</strong> The ultimate status symbol will be eating <em>only</em> what is locally available and sleeping according to natural light cycles, rejecting the “optimized 72 degrees year-round” environment.</li></ul><h4>4. Pattern recognition becomes the product</h4><p>As consumers become savvier (largely due to the “de-influencing” trend), they will stop buying “innovations.” Successful products in 2030 will explicitly market themselves as <strong>translations</strong>. They will say: <em>“This is a 9,000-year-old jar, we just made it fit in your modern fridge.”</em> Authenticity will replace “Biohacking” as the dominant marketing language.</p><h3>Conclusion: The product as container for the story</h3><p>The practices that keep humans healthy are ancient: Eat less sometimes. Move with your tribe. Rest with the sun. Consume beneficial bacteria.</p><p>As Product Managers, we aren’t discoverers; we are <strong>translators</strong>. We build containers for stories that convince each generation to do what has always worked. But the most valuable “innovation” for the next decade won’t be a better sensor. It will be the courage to recognize that some things don’t need innovation at all. They need:</p><ul><li><strong>Time</strong> (lost to optimization culture)</li><li><strong>Community</strong> (lost to individualization)</li><li><strong>Trust</strong> (lost to data dependency)</li></ul><p>The product was never the solution. <strong>The practice was.</strong></p><blockquote><em>The pattern is visible.

<h4>The redesign tested well. Users hate it anyway. Welcome to the paradox that costs companies millions and leaves everyone baffled.</h4><p>When Sonos released its <a href=""https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/sonos-app-redesign-fail-customer-outrage-and-falling-stock-prices/"">redesigned app in May 2024</a>, the backlash was immediate and brutal. Users couldn’t access basic features like volume control and alarms. Systems became unusable. The company’s stock plummeted 25%. Eventually, the CEO was replaced, and <a href=""https://www.classaction.org/sonos-app-update-arbitration"">lawsuits claimed over $5 million in damages</a> from customers who’d lost functionality they’d paid for.</p><p>But here’s the part that makes this story particularly fascinating: Sonos hadn’t just thrown darts at a wall and hoped for the best. The redesign came after extensive testing and development. They genuinely believed it was an improvement. And they’re far from alone in discovering that what looks good on paper can feel terrible in practice.</p><figure><img alt=""Netflix homepage featuring Black Mirror as the hero title under “Only on Netflix,” with badges for New Season and Emmy Award Winner, alongside thumbnails for You and Cobra Kai."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*q5vFJIgoFU_OFt2GrIEQAg.png"" /><figcaption>Netflix’s redesigned TV interface. Image source: <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/netflix-new-tv-layout"">Netflix</a></figcaption></figure><p>Even something as small as <a href=""https://android.gadgethacks.com/news/google-photos-restores-missing-perspective-tool-after-user-revolt/"">Google Photos changing its crop tool</a> from square corners to rounded ones in July 2025 triggered enough complaints that Google eventually reversed the change. <a href=""https://www.webpronews.com/netflix-2025-tv-app-ui-redesign-faces-widespread-user-backlash/"">Netflix faced similar fury</a> when it rolled out its TV app redesign later that year. They claimed months of testing showed improved user satisfaction. Yet Reddit threads exploded with users reporting the new layout as a bug, convinced something had gone catastrophically wrong. Then in October, <a href=""https://www.profilenews.com/en/instagram-new-update-sparks-user/"">Instagram reorganised its bottom navigation bar</a>, and users immediately started accidentally swiping between sections when they meant to browse photos.</p><p>The pattern repeats itself with almost mathematical precision: the company announces a redesign, users revolt, comment sections fill with rage, and everyone involved feels misunderstood. So what’s actually happening here?</p><h3>Your brain on autopilot</h3><p>Every time you open an app you use regularly, your brain isn’t really thinking about what you’re doing. You’ve developed what cognitive psychologists call automaticity: the ability to perform tasks without conscious attention. Your thumb knows exactly where that button sits. Your eyes scan the screen following a pattern you’ve rehearsed thousands of times. You’re operating almost entirely on muscle memory.</p><p>This isn’t laziness. It’s efficiency. Our brains are designed to convert frequently repeated actions into automatic processes, freeing up mental resources for more demanding tasks. <strong>When you can navigate your favourite app without thinking, that’s your brain working exactly as intended.</strong></p><p>Then comes the redesign.</p><p>Suddenly, that button you could tap with your eyes closed has moved. The menu you accessed with a quick gesture now requires three taps through nested options. Everything that was once automatic now demands active focus. You’re forced back into deliberate, effortful thinking… and it feels exhausting.</p><figure><img alt=""Before-and-after comparison of Duolingo’s learning path redesign on a green background: the old grid layout with circular skill icons (Basics, Phrases, Animals, Food, Family) on the left, and the new linear path with sequential nodes and the Duo owl mascot on the right."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/992/1*DfLmJS5Q1DE4y1rjP6reGw.png"" /><figcaption>Duolingo’s home screen redesign. Image source: <a href=""https://blog.duolingo.com/new-duolingo-home-screen-design/"">Duolingo</a></figcaption></figure><p>When <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/duolingos-update-redesign-luis-von-ahn-interview-rcna44655"">Duolingo redesigned its app in 2022</a>, switching from a branching tree structure to a single linear path, longtime users were livid. The company’s CEO, Luis von Ahn, acknowledged the backlash but stood firm: “People are change averse,” he said, refusing to offer users a way to revert. What he framed as resistance to change was actually something more specific. <strong>Users had built sophisticated mental models of how to navigate the app, and those models had just become obsolete overnight.</strong></p><p>The cognitive load of relearning isn’t trivial. Research into cognitive fluency shows that when information feels difficult to process, we experience it as unpleasant, regardless of whether the end result is objectively better. Your brain genuinely registers the increased effort, and it doesn’t particularly care that the new design tested well with fresh users who never had to unlearn anything.</p><h3>Loss aversion and the endowment effect</h3><p>Even if a redesign objectively offers improvements, we fixate on what’s been taken away. This isn’t just psychological stubbornness. It’s a well-documented cognitive bias called <a href=""https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/loss-aversion/"">loss aversion</a>. We feel losses roughly twice as intensely as equivalent gains.</p><p>The Sonos disaster illustrates this perfectly. Yes, the new app had a sleeker interface. But users couldn’t adjust their volume or set alarms — functions they’d relied on daily. No amount of visual polish could compensate for losing tools that had become part of their routines. One user’s complaint, shared thousands of times across social media, captured the sentiment: “I’ve spent over £10,000 on a complete home Sonos system. Even if you fix this app, the damage is done.”</p><p>There’s another psychological force at play here: the <a href=""https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/endowment-effect"">endowment effect</a>. We overvalue things we already possess. <strong>That old interface isn’t just a collection of buttons and menus–it’s ours. We’ve invested time learning it, built workflows around it, developed preferences and shortcuts.</strong> The new design might be objectively superior in controlled testing, but it requires us to surrender something we’ve claimed as our own.</p><figure><img alt=""Three iPhone mockups of a meal planning app showing a daily calorie tracker with macronutrient breakdown, a “3 Week Weight Loss” meal plan with a rocket illustration, and a daily meal planner with swappable breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner options."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*71XrxVq75pOPEAWdex70tA.png"" /><figcaption>Lifesum’s old UI.

Image source: <a href=""https://yulife.com/blog/lifesum-partnership/"">YuLife</a></figcaption></figure><h3>The familiarity principle</h3><p>Here’s where things get interesting: the design you hate today might be the design you prefer in three months.</p><p>The <a href=""https://www.verywellmind.com/mere-exposure-effect-definition-2795100"">mere exposure effect</a> is one of psychology’s most robust findings. <strong>We develop preferences simply through repeated exposure.</strong> The old design wasn’t necessarily better, it was just familiar. And familiarity feels good. It feels safe. It feels right.</p><p>This creates a paradox for designers. The Netflix redesign that users called “horrible” and “confusing” when it launched? Netflix’s own data suggested that user satisfaction actually improved over time as people adjusted. Von Ahn made the same claim about Duolingo’s controversial path update, pointing to positive engagement metrics even as the Reddit community devoted to the app erupted in fury.</p><p><strong>The question becomes: how long do users need before familiarity catches up? And how much short-term pain is acceptable for long-term gain?</strong></p><p>Instagram’s October 2025 navigation changes demonstrate the friction period. The same swipe gesture now switches between sections and browses multi-photo posts, a decision that likely made sense in design reviews but feels confusing in practice. Will users eventually develop new muscle memory? Almost certainly. But in the meantime, each accidental section switch reinforces the feeling that something is broken.</p><h3>When good design feels wrong</h3><p>This is perhaps the most frustrating part for designers: even genuine improvements can feel worse during the transition.</p><p>Change blindness (our difficulty noticing even significant alterations when we’re not specifically looking for them) means users often can’t articulate what’s different. They just know something feels off. <strong>The cognitive load of adjusting creates a general sense of friction that colours the entire experience negatively.</strong></p><p>Google Photos’ removal of the perspective correction tool in July 2025 showcases another dimension. Google buried manual editing tools deeper to highlight their new AI features, transforming what used to be a two-tap process into a three-tap journey through nested menus. From Google’s perspective, this made sense: guide users toward powerful AI assistance. From the users’ perspective: “where did my tools go?”</p><p>The backlash was significant enough that Google eventually reversed course, restoring both the perspective tool and those familiar square-cornered crop brackets that they’d changed to rounded ones. Sometimes the smallest visual details matter most, especially when they affect the tools people use daily.</p><h3>The AI complication</h3><p>Duolingo’s story adds another layer that’s increasingly relevant: what happens when redesigns coincide with fundamental shifts in how work gets done?</p><p>The 2022 interface redesign was contentious enough. But then in late 2023, <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/09/duolingo-cut-10-of-its-contractor-workforce-as-the-company-embraces-ai/"">Duolingo laid off 10% of its contractors</a>: translators whose work was being handed to AI. Another round of cuts followed in October 2024, this time affecting writers. Then in April 2025, <a href=""https://www.techrepublic.com/article/news-duolingo-replaces-contractors-ai/"">von Ahn sent an internal memo</a> (which he also shared publicly on LinkedIn) declaring Duolingo would become “AI-first.” The company would “gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle.”</p><p>For users, this created a toxic combination. <strong>The redesign had already disrupted their experience and removed choice. Now they were watching human expertise being replaced by AI-generated content, with remaining contractors reduced to reviewing machine output for basic acceptability.</strong> The redesign wasn’t just annoying. It felt like evidence of a company prioritising cost-cutting over quality.</p><p>This matters because trust is fragile. When users are already frustrated with interface changes that make their experience worse, discovering that those changes might be driven by a desire to reduce reliance on human workers compounds the sense of betrayal. You’re not just fighting with unfamiliar buttons. You’re questioning whether the company still cares about delivering the experience that made you loyal in the first place.</p><figure><img alt=""Three iPhone mockups showcasing Duolingo Max’s AI features: the subscription page with the owl mascot, an “Explain My Answer” French grammar breakdown, and a “Roleplay” scenario helping a lost tourist in Paris."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DokQmHXtC4s5MbXkL7Wpgw.png"" /><figcaption>Duolingo’s AI-focus has received significant backlash from their users. Image source: <a href=""https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-max/"">Duolingo</a></figcaption></figure><h3>What designers can (and can’t) control</h3><p>So what’s a designer to do? The paradox is real: you can’t improve products without changing them, but users will resist change even when it’s beneficial.</p><p>First, accept that the initial backlash isn’t necessarily a sign you’ve failed. Almost every major redesign faces resistance, even ones that ultimately succeed. The Snapchat redesign of 2018 was so unpopular that over a million users signed a petition demanding they undo it. Kylie Jenner’s tweet criticising it temporarily tanked the company’s stock. Yet Snapchat didn’t revert, and the platform survived.</p><p>There is a transitioning problem at play, too. <strong>During that adjustment period, even improvements create cognitive load.</strong> This doesn’t mean your metrics are lying or your users don’t know what they want. It means change has an inherent cost that takes time to recoup.</p><p>Second, how you roll out changes matters enormously. Sonos’ biggest mistake wasn’t just removing features; it was forcing every user into the new app without offering a beta period or a graceful transition. Users reported that the app was “obviously unfinished” and full of critical bugs. When people asked why it was released in that state during a community forum, there was no good answer.</p><p><strong>Gradual rollouts give you time to catch issues before they become disasters.</strong> Duolingo rolled their path update to new users first, getting early feedback before exposing longtime users. Netflix tested their redesign extensively. But even sophisticated rollout strategies can’t eliminate the fundamental challenge: people who’ve built workflows around your old interface need time and support to adjust.</p><p>Third, communication can help, but only if it’s honest. <strong>Telling users “we tested this, and it’s better” when they’re actively experiencing it as worse creates a disconnect.</strong> Acknowledging that change is difficult, explaining what you’re trying to achieve, and being responsive to legitimate concerns about lost functionality builds more goodwill than insisting everything is fine when it clearly isn’t.</p><p>Google’s decision to eventually restore the perspective correction tool after months of complaints shows that sometimes listening to users means admitting you got it wrong. Duolingo’s refusal to maintain two versions because “it’s difficult” prioritises engineering convenience over user experience.</p><p>Finally, consider whether you’re inadvertently training users to distrust you. <strong>When redesigns coincide with AI integration, workforce reductions, or other changes that suggest cost-cutting over quality, users notice.</strong> They’re not just reacting to the interface. They’re reacting to what the interface represents.</p><figure><img alt=""A staged desk scene contrasting old and new technology.

The automatic processes that make change feel painful are the same ones that make daily tasks effortless. We evolved to build efficient mental models and resist disruptions to them, because in most contexts, that stability serves us well.</p><p>For designers, this creates a genuine dilemma. Products need to evolve. Interfaces that never change become outdated and lose competitive ground. But every change carries a cost that shows up in user frustration, support tickets, and angry Reddit threads, no matter how good your testing data looks.</p><p>The gap between objective improvement and subjective experience cannot be ignored. Metrics can show increased engagement while users are simultaneously threatening to cancel their subscriptions. Both things can be true at once.</p><p>Perhaps the real insight is that redesigns aren’t just about interface improvements. They’re about relationship management. <strong>Users who feel heard, who understand why changes are happening, and who trust that the company has their interests at heart are far more likely to weather the transition period.</strong> Users who feel forced into changes they didn’t ask for, who lose functionality they depended on, and who suspect the redesign is really about cutting costs will revolt — no matter how good your testing data looks.</p><p>Not all that changes, improves. But that which does improve often needs to change. The trick is knowing the difference and having the humility to admit when you’ve got it wrong. Sometimes, the most important feature you can build is an undo button.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Thanks for reading! 📖</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote><em>If you liked this post, </em><a href=""https://medium.com/@doracee""><em>follow me on Medium</em></a><em> for more!</em></blockquote><h3>References &amp; Credits:</h3><ul><li>Sonos App Redesign Backlash: <a href=""https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/sonos-app-redesign-fail-customer-outrage-and-falling-stock-prices/"">CMSWire coverage of customer outrage and falling stock prices</a></li><li>Sonos App Arbitration: <a href=""https://www.classaction.org/sonos-app-update-arbitration"">ClassAction.org lawsuit details</a></li><li>Netflix 2025 TV App UI Redesign: <a href=""https://www.webpronews.com/netflix-2025-tv-app-ui-redesign-faces-widespread-user-backlash/"">WebProNews analysis of user backlash</a></li><li>Instagram Update: <a href=""https://www.profilenews.com/en/instagram-new-update-sparks-user/"">Profile News coverage of interface redesign</a></li><li>Google Photos Tool Restoration: <a href=""https://android.gadgethacks.com/news/google-photos-restores-missing-perspective-tool-after-user-revolt/"">Android Gadget Hacks on perspective tool reversal</a></li><li>Duolingo Redesign: <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/duolingos-update-redesign-luis-von-ahn-interview-rcna44655"">NBC News interview with CEO Luis von Ahn</a></li><li>Lifesum User Reviews: <a href=""https://www.trustpilot.com/review/lifesum.com"">Trustpilot customer feedback</a></li><li>Loss Aversion: <a href=""https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/loss-aversion/"">Behavioral Economics explanation</a></li><li>Endowment Effect: <a href=""https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/endowment-effect"">The Decision Lab overview</a></li><li>Mere Exposure Effect: <a href=""https://www.verywellmind.com/mere-exposure-effect-definition-2795100"">Verywell Mind definition</a></li><li>Duolingo Layoffs: <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/09/duolingo-cut-10-of-its-contractor-workforce-as-the-company-embraces-ai/"">TechCrunch coverage of contractor cuts</a></li><li>Duolingo AI-First Strategy: <a href=""https://www.techrepublic.com/article/news-duolingo-replaces-contractors-ai/"">Tech Republic on replacing contractors</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=263a75915c86"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/why-your-brain-rebels-against-redesigns-even-good-ones-263a75915c86"">Why your brain rebels against redesigns — even good ones</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Stay relevant by honing your intuition, not your process</h4><figure><img alt=""A person holding a lightbulb surrounded by gears"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZE5eeDaCBXTna7g9GMm5gA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Illustration by Hannah James</figcaption></figure><p>You likely know, or at the very least know of, a designer who just gets it. I’m talking about the designer who solves complex problems with elegant, user-centred, buildable solutions without breaking a sweat. Or maybe that designer who turns everything they touch into something genuinely beautiful. Or even the one who gets up on a stage and says what we’re all thinking more clearly and eloquently than we can. Maybe all three. Love or irrationally hate them, there they are, making the things that you struggle with daily look easy. You look skyward and wonder, “what is it they have that I don’t?”</p><p>The answer is intuition. They inherently understand what you don’t, and it’s the thing that separates good from great in every field. Paul McCartney just “gets” music. Einstein just “got” Physics. Chumbawamba just “gets” knocked down (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H5uWRjFsGc"">and they get up again</a>).</p><p>But what do we really mean when we say intuition when it comes to design, and why is it resurfacing so vehemently as AI comes into our practice, guns a-blazin’? And importantly, if you’re not feeling particularly intuitive today, how do you fix that? Can you even? The answer is everyone’s favourite “yes, but…”.</p><h4><strong>Intuition and Design</strong></h4><p>If you unpack the concept of intuition, what is it really? For psychologist Daniel Kahneman*, “intuition is thinking that you know without knowing why you do.” People who intuit correct solutions easily have trouble explaining their process in reaching them. (Zulz)</p><p>Cognitively, intuition is explained by unconscious processes, and might also be called “expertise”. The brain is very good at learning implicitly, and can compare stored memories, patterns, and even emotions with a current scenario without “thinking”. Your brain is even capable of activating what are called <em>mental schemas</em>, complex “chunks” of information, which is how I suddenly still know how to drive whenever I (rarely) find myself behind the wheel of a car. (Cockcroft et al.)</p><p>This figures into design as a practice more than other disciplines, because design trades in what are called “wicked problems”; those that are ill-defined, and lack a single “correct” solution. Design thinking pioneer Nigel Cross, writing in his landmark <em>Designerly ways of knowing</em>, separates design as a discipline, by the fact that it is solution, and not problem-focussed. (Cross 223). For Cross:</p><blockquote>“What designers know about their own problem solving processes remains largely tacit knowledge — ie they know it in the same way that a skilled person ‘knows’ how to perform that skill. They find it difficult to externalize their knowledge, and hence design education is forced to rely so heavily on an apprenticeship system of learning.”(224)</blockquote><p>Design-god Paul Rand, himself possessing a triumphant sense of intuition, stressed its importance, as a sense beyond instructions that can be followed, writing;</p><blockquote>“No system of proportion, color, or space can possibly insure meaningful results. A system can be applied either intuitively or consciously, interestingly or boringly. There is always an element of choice, sometimes called good judgment, at other times good taste. Aside from practical considerations, in matters of form the typographer, for example, must rely on intuition.”</blockquote><p>Intuition in design comes in many forms. For some, it’s finding harmonious visual balance– a nearly automatic application of <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles?srsltid=AfmBOorMb2L-KAfUCTrxzXSvboGPJfw73wM13Zk12rlL_yzBmTRDVzhV"">Gestalt principles</a>. For others, it’s an immediate jump to a solution that just works, or an immediate pivot from one that won’t. Maybe it’s that you connect the dots on where things are going naturally, without doomscrolling <em>Medium</em>. If you’re intuitive, you get to skip the steps. Within every superstar designer, you’ll find a refined intuition in some form or another.</p><p><em>(Note: Kahneman spends a large portion of Thinking Fast and Slow identifying breakdowns in intuition that we routinely make. So when I talk about intuition, it’s really intuition that turns out to be right. “Good intuition”. Lots of people trust their intuition and come to wrong answers, which is why it’s important to be critical of any idea that comes too easily. Gut-check your gut-check.)</em></p><h4><strong>Design’s Skill Cycle, AI’s Tornado</strong></h4><p>If you’re a student of history, or at the very least old, you know that change, when it comes to technology and work, follows a cycle. To begin, a small number of skilled workers produce a product or service that meets a need (demand). As that need expands, skilled labour runs short (supply), which triggers a process called de-skilling, which is exactly what you think it is; taking the skill out of the process in order to meet demand. This involves breaking down the process into small parts that can be done by anyone with training (think of the assembly line). Once a process has become as de-skilled as it can be, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_unemployment"">technology steps in and automates the process</a> (once the cost of automation sinks below the cost of labour). <em>This is classical economic theory, you’ll find it in both Adam Smith and Karl Marx.</em></p><figure><img alt=""factory workers assembling a car on an assembly line"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2SGCLKLyKVG3F24Yg6dopw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Ford assembly line, 1913 (Wikipedia)</figcaption></figure><p>Design has been through this cycle more than once. The creation of movable type in the 1450s gave swathes of scribes the heave-ho, and launched the careers of typesetters, and printers. The need for more printed materials launched type foundries, and improved printing presses, de-skilling the printing process, and making it easier and cheaper to do. Eventually printing automated many of its processes, and the cycle began again.</p><figure><img alt=""Workers at the Chicago tribune office setting type using machines"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uyklq4aGPVsvZZFSIr5WKQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Linotype machines at the Chicago Tribune in the 1960s. InDesign sort of does the job of this entire room of people today (Illinois State Historical library)</figcaption></figure><p>By the time the personal computer started entering households in the 1980s, it brought with it desktop publishing, which wiped out the typesetting industry save for a small cottage industry. A new set of skilled designers emerged using those programs, the glut of materials produced expanded, and again automated.</p><p>Even product design (or UX, or whatever you call it) has been through this cycle before. Before UX software existed, designers used Photoshop (or maybe InDesign), slicing up assets, and redlining pdfs to hand to developers. As the demand for UX design has grown (thanks to the internet and an explosion of digital products), technical solutions have made it easier to do more with less.</p><p>UX today is well inside its de-skilling phase. With sky-high demand over the last decade, Human Computer Interaction, a field once reserved for artsy computer scientists, has ballooned into the field we know today. To meet the needs, it was imperative to de-skill the job. That began with the expansion of design education, and the creation of the “design process” in a formal way. UI kits, design systems, best practice resources, heuristics, playbooks, as well as the absolute dominance of easy-to-use Figma in the field has made it easier than ever for someone with minimal training to “trust the process” and expect that the outcome will be good. A conglomeration of a slim few tech companies that steer the look and feel of virtually all digital products means that they set “best practices”, and those are easy to copy. Even the separation of the production process into product, design, and engineering is itself a breakdown of a very complex system into more isolated parts. Not quite the assembly line, although sometimes it might feel that way.</p><p>But what’s the next step after de-skilling? Automation. We’re seeing it happen live, right now. When Jakob Nielsen posts about Gemini potentially <a href=""https://jakobnielsenphd.substack.com/p/generative-ui-google"">producing better UI than humans</a>, you might feel a bit like a blacksmith pounding a horseshoe while a car rolls by. AI brings with it an automation of the parts of the information economy (and just the economy at large) that have de-skilled. UX design as we know it is most certainly in that category.</p><p><em>(A side note about progress: Do we care if it’s bad? No! As much as we like to grump about how things were better back when ______(insert thing here), fortune typically favours the cheap over the good. Hooray for Capitalism! Will AI-generated UI initially suck? Yes. Will that stop it from becoming the default? No, not if you believe that history rhymes. Early assembly line produced products were horribly bad, but here we are.)</em></p><h4><strong>The re-rise of the intuitive designer</strong></h4><p>Don’t call it a comeback. But let’s look at the facts. AI can produce UI today. And tomorrow it’ll be a little better at it. Generative AI uses both training and models of inference to produce results. And it’s capable of producing multiple solutions at once, very quickly. Any principles or best practices or research that you’re working from can be ingested. So if your design skillset is centred around your diligence in following a process, or your ability to operate design software, well, things don’t look great for you.</p><p>Claude designer Jenny Wen, speaking at last year’s HATCH conference, said the quiet thing loud. In her talk “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u94juYwLLM"">Don’t trust the process</a>,” Wen observes that the good design work she’s seen happen is rarely a product of process, and instead born from intuition and play. The reality is that the pace of work has accelerated, and the “discover” phase of the design process is increasingly seen as extraneous, given that an automated solution can come quickly (to be clear I don’t personally love that this is happening, but it IS happening).</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/7631d3b179288f2cc8ef6cdffde5e9b5/href"">https://medium.com/media/7631d3b179288f2cc8ef6cdffde5e9b5/href</a><p>Not that they were unsuccessful before, but here is where the intuitive designer proves themselves to be more relevant than ever, perhaps exclusively relevant. Intuition provides the things that AI can’t do better– it can bring novel solutions to the table, and make judgments about potential solutions without certainty. Design intuition can also interrogate the problem, and the requirements set to ensure that they truly align. Recall the quote (apocryphally) attributed to Henry Ford, that goes: “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses”. AI can think of faster horses, intuition can think of cars. This has prompted some thinkers to posit the move from a knowledge-economy, to an <a href=""https://singularity2030.ch/the-power-of-intuition-in-scientific-discovery-and-ai/#:~:text=According%20to%20Nobel%20Prize%20Winner,without%20logical%20arguments%20or%20evidence"">intuition economy</a>. (Rudin)</p><p>If the future of design involves democratising skills through automation by wielding AI tools, Wen says it best: <strong>“In a world where anyone can make anything– what matters is your ability to choose and curate what you make.”</strong> (Wen)</p><h4><strong>Let’s get intuit(ive)</strong></h4><p>Just as following a recipe doesn’t make you a great chef and learning dance steps doesn’t make you a great choreographer, flawlessly executing every step of the design process doesn’t make you a great designer. Bridging the gap requires using your intuition to elide processes, and to make correct decisions hundreds of times as you design.</p><p>If you’re feeling a little glum, and not particularly intuitive today, fear not. Intuition is like a muscle, and just about anyone is capable of building it.</p><p>One way is simply, experience. That’s not to say job experience, but it certainly helps. The more design you experience, the more you’ll build mental schemas and memories around design. Look at design, lots and lots of design. Think about it. Think about why things look the way they do, why this solution has been chosen. If it resonates with you, think about why that is. Develop your sense of taste. Have an opinion!</p><p>Understanding how something actually works might give you more perspective on the problems present, and the solutions available, and might allow you to make connections others can’t see. The great artist Michelangelo spent a creepy amount of time watching dissections, and even performing some. He was able to apply that knowledge to painting and sculpting in ways that showed the true dynamism of the human figure. If you’re a car designer, you should know how metal works. If you’re a digital designer, you should understand code.</p><p>Of course, design is not all about the artefacts, it’s about the people who use them. It’s not surprising that many a great designer, musician, artist, etc. turn out to be either charismatic or provocative. What resonates with people in the work is intuitive to the maker. You need to understand people. For UX designers, there’s a lot to know about how <a href=""https://medium.com/loblaw-digital/this-is-your-brain-on-design-using-cognitive-science-to-design-effective-experiences-fb6b402047a5"">humans notice, perceive, understand, and generally think</a> that should impact your decision making. Humans also <a href=""http://growth.design/psychology"">exhibit biases, and while we can’t avoid them, we can study and understand them</a>. Ultimately, you can turn all of this information back on yourself, and understand how and why you might be drawing conclusions.</p><p>Finally, design. And collaborate with others who do. With each problem you solve, the more you have to draw on for the next one. Collaboration and play, and time spent with peers and mentors are amazing ways to broaden your horizons. These are the reasons artistic movements, “schools” of thought and practice, musical scenes, and even elite sports dynasties succeed. Even a little healthy competition sparks the need to be creative and intuitive (<em>consider men’s tennis’ “big three,” who collectively spent 900 weeks at number 1, who all claim that competition pushed them to new heights</em>). While no one can teach you actual intuition, you can learn it “from” others.</p><p>Of course, none of your intuition matters if you ignore it. It’s time to listen to that perhaps quiet but still persistent voice in your head that tells you when you’ve really nailed it. Trying to be more like a machine is a losing battle. Might I suggest leaning into the whole “being human” thing.</p><p><strong>*** </strong><br /><em>Thanks for reading.

<h4>Once the QA Engineer enters the room, everyone expects quality issues to be magically solved.</h4><p>Throughout my career in software testing, I’ve noticed dilemmas that affect the overall team’s dynamics and product outcomes. Believe it or not, these are the patterns that are quite common for every development team I worked with. These very patterns easily block the team’s goal, e.g. to develop a cutting-edge product that could help humanity... As a result, this amazing product exists only in the dreams of the product owner. The team builds something else instead.</p><p>Some teams praise visibility over value, forget about quality in hectic sprints and approach testing without a clear strategy. Sounds familiar? Welcome to the reality of a QA’s job.</p><h3>Visibility over value?</h3><p>In many teams, louder members get praised, even though their impact might be equal to that of more silent members. To find the typical example, just observe an average stand-up meeting. The ones who talk more get all the attention.</p><p>In her <a href=""https://code.likeagirl.io/not-all-great-work-is-loud-77874c554276"">article</a>, software engineer Priyanka Jain tells the story of two colleagues assigned the same task. One posted updates, asked questions, and collaborated loudly. The other stayed silent and shipped clean code. Both delivered. Yet only one was praised as a “great team player.”</p><figure><img alt=""Owl sees Woodpecker working on the tree. Owl asks Woodpecker: “Woody, it’s 6 AM. Why are you so loud?” Woodpecker answers: “Don’t you see? I’ve found a bug!”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_G69Y-c0U7wGkeJHXt70iQ.png"" /></figure><p>In many work cultures, we mix visibility with value. If you talk often, people assume you’re contributing. If you’re quiet, they assume you’re not. That is why <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/extroversion"">extroverted personalities</a> get promoted more often than <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/introversion"">introverted ones</a>.</p><p>If you are the only QA person on board, you need to be visible and vocal. Otherwise, your contribution goes unnoticed, the major bugs get ignored, and nobody cares about the product’s quality. Some may even wonder what you are doing there because you don’t ship code.</p><p>If you are an introvert by nature and you don’t like to exhibit your opinion or updates on every corner, it may be a challenge for you. However, this is a reality of “fast-paced” environments: the more vocal and visible you are, the better it is for the team.</p><h3>Quality is the oracle, but is it really?</h3><p>Quality is meant to be the oracle for a product team; it is something that the product team should strive for and manage accordingly. Otherwise, are you sure your customers would tolerate all those bugs and inconsistencies they run into? No team wants to see their product abandoned by the users. Yet, is quality really an oracle?</p><p>Once, I had a debate with a developer about a feature. He argued that he would definitely make a toggle button instead of a drop-down menu because “it looked more fancy”. I asked him to visualise both versions in the prototype tool so we could test each option. In the context of our specific use case, the dropdown menu still looked like an appropriate choice.</p><p>After a brief testing session that we had done together, the developer gave up and agreed. We saved time on the potential rework. (Back then, AI wasn’t so powerful yet. Right now, I would use an AI-driven tool to visualise both cases for the development team. So, we could also save time on a debate.) Anyhow, everyone was happy, including the customers who got a polished version of the product promptly.</p><p>Here, the <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/making-product-quality-a-team-sport-35d94fc0a2cf"">quality mindset</a> is something that could be learned on the way. The role of a QA person is also to promote this mindset, so team members become aware of it. When realising the priority of quality, the development team will do more to prevent bugs in production. Afterall, quality is a team sport.</p><h3>Do we need a testing strategy?</h3><p>Once the QA Engineer joins the team, everyone expects quality issues to be magically solved. Yet, there are fewer chances of success if you are alone in your efforts.</p><p>Before I joined a team, let’s call it X, it had no testing workflow, and the team wasn’t confident enough to go through the release cycle. There was a usual panic one day before the planned release. The team wasn’t yet conscious about quality. The overall feeling was like: “Testing? We just don’t have time for it. Aren’t you QA? You should figure out something!”</p><figure><img alt=""Owl is standing in front of the flipchart. “TESTING STRATEGY” is written on the flipchart."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VwRLjdR0gdBzcUFERApprA.jpeg"" /></figure><p>The whole situation reminded me of the logic of Hattifatteners from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moomins"">Tove Yansson’s book</a>, who were always on the move and wanted to reach the horizon at any price. Here, the price was quality.</p><p>In a month, I brought the team to the point where we had a hard talk about the current product quality and what we can do to release better. The team established a QA workflow that consisted of multiple testing techniques at various levels of the product (End-to-End, API, Unit). Agile Testing Quadrants, <a href=""https://lisacrispin.com/agile-testing-quadrants-version-3-from-agile-testing-condensed/"">a tool</a> first introduced by Janet Gregory and Lisa Crispin, were our framework for selecting testing techniques that matched team X’s needs. The overall product quality improved a lot then.</p><p>Before a team starts building a quality assurance system for a product, it is smart to brainstorm on how quality assurance should function. It is important to define how the quality will be measured: which t<a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/test-smart-how-to-select-testing-techniques-for-agile-team-ad6847eaa242"">esting techniques</a> will be applied to the product, and how overall testing coverage will be achieved.</p><p>It is vital to discuss the current testing status and how the team could prevent defects (which tests to use and at which level). After brainstorming sessions, the QA flow can be outlined by the team. Consequently, there will be less chaos and more peace of mind once the team ships the product.</p><p>If you are struggling with similar dilemmas, there is always a solution for each. In an agile team, get more vocal and communicate the issues clearly. If the team forgets about quality in the reality of speedy sprints, remind them about it and involve team members in testing sessions. And finally, if testing efforts look messy, talk to your team about the testing strategy and create it together. Afterall, aren’t you the one who can figure it out? 🙂</p><p><em>You may check my </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-kocbek-001893128/""><em>LinkedIn page</em></a><em> if you feel like connecting with me or are curious about my background.

<p>When <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-no-me-quiero-ir-de-aqui-residency-outfits"">Bad Bunny</a> leaped off the Levi’s Stadium field in Santa Clara, California, ending his 13-minute <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/02/10868981/super-bowl-2022-halftime-show-racism"">Super Bowl halftime show</a> chanting the lyrics of “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9T_MGfzq7I&amp;list=RDv9T_MGfzq7I&amp;start_radio=1"">DtMF</a>,” the stadium erupted in fireworks. More than 2,800 miles away in Orlando, Florida, I saw the sky outside my window light up, too, flashing in brief bursts of color. In a city with one of the largest Puerto Rican populations in the contiguous U.S., some shop-owners shut their doors early so they could catch the show together with their families, others kept the lights on well into the night to host sold-out Benito Bowl watch parties, and others took to neighborhood roads, dancing with friends under street lights or illuminating entire neighborhoods with light shows. From the rolling hills of northwest California to the low wetlands of the Southeast U.S., we, distant neighbors, celebrated like patriots commemorating our beginning — because, for the millions of us who trace our histories across the American continent, we were.</p>



<p>For the estimated <a href=""https://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/life/2026/02/09/how-many-people-watch-the-halftime-show-2026-bad-bunny/88589346007/"">135.4 to 142 million viewers</a> who tuned in globally — figures that would make Bad Bunny’s halftime show the most-watched in history — it was an invitation to reclaim what it means to be an American, an identity and inheritance that for too long has been hegemonized by the U.S., even though it belongs to an entire continent.</p>



<p>After an energetic performance of a medley of hits like “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cr8K88UcO0s&amp;list=RDCr8K88UcO0s&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUbYmFkIGJ1bm55IFRpdMOtIE1lIFByZWd1bnRvoAcB"">Tití Me Pregunto</a>,” “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtSRKwDCaZM&amp;list=RDGtSRKwDCaZM&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUYYmFkIGJ1bm55IFlvIFBlcnJlbyBTb2xhoAcB"">Yo Perreo Sola</a>,” “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCQ_6XbATPc&amp;list=RDjCQ_6XbATPc&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygURYmFkIGJ1bm55IFNhZmFlcmGgBwE%3D"">Safaera</a>,” “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9XrXnfJPsk&amp;list=RDG9XrXnfJPsk&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUPYmFkIGJ1bm55IFBhcnR5oAcB"">Party</a>,” “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2MGCIDOMZ4&amp;list=RDX2MGCIDOMZ4&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUeYmFkIGJ1bm55IFZveSBhIExsZXZhcnRlIFBhIFBSoAcB"">Voy a Llevarte Pa PR</a>,” “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myDIeOjqQos&amp;list=RDmyDIeOjqQos&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUNYmFkIGJ1bm55IEVvT6AHAQ%3D%3D"">EoO</a>,” and “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PJvpq8uOZM&amp;list=RD_PJvpq8uOZM&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUQYmFkIGJ1bm55IE1vbmFjb6AHAQ%3D%3D"">Monaco</a>,” to name a few, Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, ended his performance invoking “God Bless America.” It was the first English words he uttered during a halftime show that was historic, in part, because it was the first in the NFL’s 60-year run to ever be performed predominantly in Spanish. With the flags of Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago, Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, and the U.S., among others, waving behind him, the Puerto Rican rapper then went on to name countries across the Caribbean and South, Central, and North Americas. When he ended with “my motherland, mi patria, Puerto Rico,” he cemented his performance, like a victorious touchdown, with a football stamped with the words, “Together, We Are America.” It was a message for all of us, those who have always traced their roots to the region, those who arrived centuries ago, violently and forcefully, on ships, and those who, generation after generation, have migrated to this corner of the world carrying a dream.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958687.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA – FEBRUARY 8: Bad Bunny performs in the Apple Music Halftime Show during the NFL Super Bowl 60 football game between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots, at Levi’s Stadium on February 8, 2026 in Santa Clara, California.

<p>The words, the flags, and the faces of racially and ethnically diverse people encircling the Grammy award-winning artist sent a message to President Donald Trump and the ultra-conservative, who <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-super-bowl-maga-backlash"">boycotted Bad Bunny’s halftime show</a> because of the rapper’s cultural identity and pro-immigrant politics: America is a continent, and his rendering of “God bless America” is a prayer for the people of every nation that stretches across it, not just the white U.S. citizens who have long positioned themselves as the primary beneficiaries of the label and land.</p>



<p>Transitioning to his native tongue to complete the blessing, like any other Latine church kid who speaks in English but prays in Spanish, Martínez Ocasio intoned an even more important invocation for migrants and their descendants: “seguimos aquí” — “we are still here” — a popular Puerto Rican refrain that marks our survival, presence, and refusal amid generations of political and natural disasters. </p>



<p>Some who boycotted the performance tuned into an alternative halftime entertainment event, the “All-American Halftime Show,” organized by the conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA. It aired live online at the same time as the NFL’s official halftime show, explicitly positioned as a protest of Bad Bunny’s performance. Roughly five million viewers (a fraction of the audience that watched Benito Bowl) tuned in to watch little-known country and rock artists like Kid Rock, Brantley Gilbert, Lee Brice, and Gabby Barrett. To them, Martínez Ocasio’s identity as a Puerto Rican artist, his use of his native Spanish, and his belief that “the only thing more powerful than hate is love” were framed as a threat to white American notions of “faith, family, and freedom.” </p>



<p>Ironically, it is the people of Puerto Rico, a U.S. colonial territory, who have been calling for freedom since the U.S. seized the archipelago in 1898. Their cries reverberated throughout Bad Bunny’s performance. </p>



<p>Bad Bunny commenced his historic performance with a stage set evoking Puerto Rican history, beginning with the brutal legacy of Spanish imperialism on the island. A man wearing a pava hat — the traditional hat of Puerto Rican agricultural workers, lovingly called jíbaros — strums the opening notes of “Tití Me Preguntó” and declares, “Qué rico es ser Latino.” Behind him stand sugarcane fields, where enslaved Africans and Indigenous Taínos as well as poor criollos once labored, enriching the pockets of the island’s first colonizers and giving rise to a shared Puerto Rican identity rooted in communal power and resistance to colonial systems.</p>



<p>Seconds later, Bad Bunny’s baritone resonates across the fields. Dressed in a cream collared shirt and tie, a sport-inspired jersey bearing his family name, Ocasio, and the number 64 (representing the birth year of his mother, Lysaurie Ocasio), and his signature BadBo 1.0 Adidas sneakers, he is flanked by actors: some, wearing pava hats, embody those Puerto Rican farmworkers of the past, while others dress in modern farmwear, portraying the contemporary Latine laborers who continue to toil across the harsh agricultural landscapes of the U.S. All of them hold machetes, a tool once wielded by formerly enslaved people to revolt against colonizers across the Caribbean.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958686.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>TOPSHOT – Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny performs during Super Bowl LX Patriots vs Seahawks Apple Music Halftime Show at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California on February 8, 2026.

<p>As he dances through the sugarcane fields, Bad Bunny brings us with him to modern-day Puerto Rico. Vendors sell coco frio, welitos play dominos, Black and brown women adorn themselves at a nail salon, and workers continue to rebuild after the devastation of Hurricane María. Benito then cools off from the blazing Caribbean sun with a piragua and tacos from the beloved L.A. taco shop, Villas Tacos, a nod to the street vendors across California and the U.S. who have been targeted and harassed amid Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) crackdowns. </p>



<p>Some of the scenes he portrays are painful, but there’s joy in his resistance and power in our cultural art forms and entertainment. Watching Bad Bunny evade punches from Puerto Rican boxer Xander Zayas and Mexican boxer Emiliano Vargas evokes the pride our families feel in our living rooms, watching our people represent us in sport. Seeing Latine artists like Cardi B, Karol G, Pedro Pascal, Young Miko, and Jessica Alba dancing en la casita — a life-size replica of a traditional pink Puerto Rican house that Bad Bunny has used as a stage during his historic 31-day <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-no-me-quiero-ir-de-aqui-residency-outfits"">“No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí residency”</a> in Puerto Rico and on his Debí Tirar Más Fotos World Tour to symbolize a pari de marquesina, those Caribbean garage parties nostalgic to so many of us — summons us to move through the structural violence we continue to endure with dance, too, just as our ancestors did. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958682.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA – FEBRUARY 08: Musician Bad Bunny performs during the Apple Music halftime show at the NFL Super Bowl LX football game between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots at Levi Stadium on February 8, 2026 in Santa Clara, California.

<p>But instead of bomba and plena, traditional Afro-Puerto Rican musical genres born from protest and community, women in khaki miniskorts shake their asses as Bad Bunny raps the lyrics to his reggaeton hit “Yo Perreo Sola,” a song about bodily autonomy, independence, and the right to dance without harassment. “Las mujeres en el mundo entero, perreando sin miedo,” he says, assuring women everywhere they have the space to move freely and safely in the show he’s created. Bad Bunny then transitions smoothly into “Safaera,” where we, global fans, sing the words to a sexually explicit, and empowered, song he can’t rap on the largest stage in the world: “Si tu novio no te mama,” he sings, as countless viewers yell back, “el culo, pa eso que no mame. Baja pa casa que yo te lambo toa. Mami, yo te lambo toa.”</p>



<p>Welcoming millions of watchers to “la fiesta más grande en el mundo entero,” Bad Bunny knows his halftime performance will break streaming records. He has shattered records throughout his career, becoming <a href=""https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-12-03/wrapped-bad-bunny-top-artist-album/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Spotify’s most-streamed artist worldwide</a> in 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2025 and <a href=""https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-latin/bad-bunny-breaks-record-most-watched-amazon-music-stream-1235432020/"">surpassing Amazon Music’s live-streamed concerts</a> during his “No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí: Una Más” finale. That’s because, as the world now knows, no one parties quite like folks from the Caribbean. There is protest, resilience, and freedom in the dips, sways, and wines that <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-calls-bad-bunnys-super-bowl-halftime-show/story?id=129980124"">Trump labeled “disgusting.”</a> And through his performance of “VOY A LLeVARTE PA PR,” the Grammy award-winning “EoO,” and a medley tribute to reggaeton pioneers like Tego Calderón, Don Omar, and Daddy Yankee, Bad Bunny invites the world to perrear como una puertorriqueña, to learn history and dance through Puerto Rican rhythms. </p>



<p>Ahead of his halftime show, Bad Bunny emphasized that language wouldn’t be a barrier to enjoying his performance. Speaking with Apple Music Radio hosts Zane Lowe and Ebro Darden at the <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2026/02/06/nx-s1-5563906/bad-bunny-super-bowl-performance-predictions"">Super Bowl LX Halftime Show Press Conference</a>, Martínez Ocasio urged those who’d be watching to dance from the heart, to relish a “heartbeat dance” — and heart was at the center of the entire show. </p>



<p>There was the moment Bad Bunny stared into a camera, pointed at the viewers watching from television sets, laptop screens, and portable projectors, and encouraged them to always believe in themselves because they are worth more than they know. There was the couple, kissing after “I do” in a white wedding gown and tuxedo, who <a href=""https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/47872442/bad-bunny-super-bowl-lx-half-wedding"">legally married during the halftime show</a>. There was Lady Gaga, one of Bad Bunny’s favorite artists, and Los Sobrinos, a Puerto Rican band who played on his most recent album, <em><a href=""https://music.apple.com/us/album/deb%C3%AD-tirar-m%C3%A1s-fotos/1787022393"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS</a></em>, performing a salsa rendition of “Die With a Smile” as the newlyweds shared their wedding cake. And when Bad Bunny returned to the mic, there were moments of cross-generational care. First, while singing his hit “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1Femq4NPxs&amp;list=RDa1Femq4NPxs&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUbYmFkIGJ1bm55IEJBSUxFIElOb0xWSURBQkxFoAcB"">BAILE INoLVIDABLE</a>,” he gently woke a child sleeping on two seats, an experience every Latine who grew up going to family parties that stretch well into the night knows. Then, during “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU5V5WZVcVE&amp;list=RDKU5V5WZVcVE&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUTYmFkIGJ1bm55IE51ZXZhIFlvbKAHAQ%3D%3D"">Nueva Yol</a>,” he gifted a child his Album of the Year Grammy trophy, kneeling to the ground, and whispering to him, “Cree siempre en ti.” The boy symbolizes Bad Bunny’s own inner child, Latine youth across the diaspora, and, perhaps, even <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/US/administration-seeking-expedited-removal-5-year-family-rep/story?id=129918648"">Liam Conejo Ramos</a>, the five-year-old Ecuadorian boy who was detained by ICE in Minnesota while coming home from school.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958684.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=769&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A769"" /><figcaption>SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA – FEBRUARY 08: A couple marries during the Bad Bunny performance onstage during the Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show at Levi’s Stadium on February 08, 2026 in Santa Clara, California.

<p>But Martínez Ocasio’s heart danced most passionately for his homeland — and for Puerto Ricans, whose population in the contiguous U.S. outnumbers that in the archipelago, home is often experienced differently, though no less authentically, throughout the diaspora. In “Nueva Yol,” Benito takes us to a Puerto Rican neighborhood in the Big Apple, with Puerto Rican flags hanging from store windows, women braiding each other’s hair outside of a barber shop, Brooklyn’s own Toñita, the beloved owner of the community anchor Caribbean Social Club, handing him a shot of rum, and Boricuas of every shade dancing in the street to a genre their Nuyorican ancestors co-created. </p>



<p>Ricky Martin then takes us back to Puerto Rico, now to the rural mountains, where he reinterprets Ocasio Martínez’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvfDaZ4ZT80&amp;list=RDuvfDaZ4ZT80&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUgYmFkIGJ1bm55IExvIFF1ZSBQYXPDsyBlbiBIYXdhaWmgBwE%3D"">Lo Que Pasó en Hawaii</a>,” a protest song against U.S. colonialism in Puerto Rico and a call to its people to fight to preserve land, heritage, and culture at a time when tourism-driven colonial pressures aim to reshape the island. When Bad Bunny returns to the mic, it’s to perform “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdQEljUMCEM&amp;list=RDQdQEljUMCEM&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUUYmFkIGJ1bm55IEVsIEFwYWfDs26gBwE%3D"">El Apagón</a>,” a sharply political song that uses the debilitating power outages in Puerto Rico to critique government corruption and displacement. Carrying a Puerto Rican flag and, at one point, scaling a sparking utility pole, Bad Bunny, through the song, urges Puerto Ricans to fight for the future and sovereignty of their land and people.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958688.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=682&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A341"" /><figcaption>SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA – FEBRUARY 08: Bad Bunny performs onstage during the Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show at Levi’s Stadium on February 08, 2026 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>



<p>But as the music shifts from electro-reggaeton to plena, traditional Puerto Rican folk music, Bad Bunny extends his call. Walking off a set design of Puerto Rico that, in itself, should garner awards, and symbolically into the homes of those watching across the Americas, he names each country that makes up the Caribbean, South America, Central America, and North America — urging us all to reimagine American-ness, no longer restricted to the U.S.’s linguistic hegemony or make-believe colonial borders. Bound by shared histories, cultures, and resilience, he invites us to claim belonging and community that transcends nation-states and challenges centuries of imposed divisions.</p>



<p>This, of course, is the greatest threat to the ultra-right. It’s why Turning Point produced the All-American Halftime Show. It fears not just Bad Bunny but what his artistry is capable of: reimagination. </p>



<p>Through history, education, joy, dance, pleasure, and love, Bad Bunny’s music allows us to envision another reality — one where we, as marginalized people, understand our power and our worth, and where we fight lovingly for our undocumented neighbor in the house next door and for those enduring state repression in neighboring countries. </p>



<p>This is the cross-continental America we can create, the one where solidarity, justice, and dignity prevail for all of us, the one worth putting our hearts into and illuminating our skies for. After all, as Martínez Ocasio noted in a jumbotron during his final performance: “the only thing more powerful than hate is love.” <br /></p>

<p>From the very beginning, <strong><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sabrinaelba/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sabrina Elba</a></strong> has been clear about who she is creating for. In this episode of <em>Go Off, Sis</em> sponsored by <strong><a href=""https://www.target.com/c/celebrate-black-history-month/-/N-bw2fb"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Target</a></strong> and its Black History Month collection, which spotlights Black founders building with community in mind, the <strong><a href=""https://sablelabs.co/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22847971116&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAoySwxa6rLOwHWVWAJcsScPLRC9lL&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA1czLBhDhARIsAIEc7uj5Kp50Tl2ZVUdqaZx83ZYTNqfBs6Q8LybIEocgYKH2ipcnetAgRzsaAsi-EALw_wcB"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">S’ABLE Labs</a></strong> co-founder breaks down what it means to build beauty intentionally, ethically, and with communities of color at the center rather than the margins.</p>



<p>At the heart of Elba’s approach is what she calls “A beauty,” a term rooted in African beauty knowledge passed down across generations. “It’s the passing down of knowledge, traditions, ingredients, customs, throughout the whole continent of Africa,” she explains. That history is not just inspiration. It is a framework for how she builds. African botanicals like shea, Black soap, and rooibos come from some of the world’s harshest climates, which Elba says makes them especially powerful for skincare. For Elba, purpose lives in how those ingredients are used, not just where they come from. </p>



<p>Purpose also shows up in how those ingredients are formulated. Elba is intentional about pairing traditional African botanicals with modern skincare science, creating products designed to support melanin-rich skin without irritation. “Everything is fragrance free,” she says. “I don’t want to irritate skin that has gone through it.” Her philosophy reflects a belief that starting with more sensitive, inflammation-prone skin leads to better products overall.</p>



<p>That mindset was shaped by personal experience. As a teenager, Elba struggled with products that damaged her skin barrier and failed to meet her needs. “It’s part of the reason I’m so frustrated with the beauty industry, frustrated enough to start a brand,” she says. Rather than adapting to what existed, she chose to build something new with intention.</p>



<p>Elba’s purpose extends beyond formulation into how her brand operates. As a UN Goodwill Ambassador, she brings the same care to sourcing, working directly with farming communities across Africa and prioritizing transparency, fair wages, and safe working conditions. “If a product doesn’t tell you where those ingredients are coming from, we need to question that,” she says. It is an approach that aligns closely with Target’s <em>Made With Purpose</em> initiative, where ethical practices are treated as essential, not optional.</p>



<p>The beauty founder also pushes back on the narrow way Black-founded brands are often framed. “You haven’t created a Black product,” she says. “You’ve created a better product period.” Starting with communities of color, she argues, raises the bar for the entire industry.</p>



<p>Listen to the full <em>Go Off, Sis</em> episode to hear Elba chat with Senior Content Director of Entertainment at Refinery29/Unbothered, Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Brand Partnerships Lead at Unbothered, Sandy Pierre, and Social Strategist at Unbothered, Jessika Hardy, about African beauty knowledge, clean formulation, and why the industry still has catching up to do.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958198.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>In the midst of all the chaos going on in the world, it’s nice to know that Venus in Pisces is bringing us a fairytale vibe. Venus in Pisces, which lasts from February 10th to March 6th 2026, is pulling out all the lovely stops, allowing us to feel confident in ourselves as well as relationships (both platonic and romantic). This is a moment of gentleness. We are finding solace and comfort through intimacy in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-lookbook-editor-letter-2025"">the depths of winter</a>. Whether we’re involved with others or not, it’ll be easy to feel the warmth and kindness regardless.</p>



<p>Venus in Pisces is in its “exaltation,” meaning the position of the planet in the water sign is favorable. The reason Venus thrives in Pisces is that the planet yearns to be unconditional, adaptable, tender, and creative. Venus in Pisces is all that and more — encouraging people to be forgiving and sacrificing for others. This transit encourages us to lead with the heart, ask questions later, and to understand those we care about through compassion. At times, Venus in Pisces can make us idealistic, but it’s only that we want to believe in the fantasy we set in our minds about what partnerships should be and look like. Anything less than that won’t suffice.  </p>



<p>On occasion, Venus in Pisces can be a tad mischievous, since the water sign is a mutable sign and absorbs the energy around it. People could take advantage of our goodwill, demanding more without reciprocating, and in turn, pushing us to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/casual-relationship-rules-boundaries"">call for boundaries.</a> Therefore, we have to be careful about what we allow in our lives and the quality of people we associate with. Be mindful of those who aren’t serving us anymore. </p>



<p>This time around, Venus in Pisces encourages us to be dreamy and artistic. Eclipse season and Mercury retrograde cross paths with Venus in Pisces, pushing us to focus on camaraderie and self-care more than anything else. Aligning with partners that are on the same page won’t be hard, although our desires are currently evolving and in flux. Three major aspects are essential to defining how Venus in Pisces will affect us. Fortunately, the North Node of Destiny, Jupiter, and Uranus are cultivating greatness for everyone. </p>



<p>Embrace switching up your style, if you want to. If you do, then use the weeks before February 26th, when Mercury turns retrograde, to ensure no regrets.</p>



<p>On February 17th, the same day as the Lunar New Year and annular solar eclipse in Aquarius, Venus aligns with the North Node of Destiny in Pisces. The karmic moment makes us more passionate and optimistic about relationships. Our confidence is high, pushing us to shoot our shot when it comes to asking out our crush, evolving commitments, and trying a new approach to dating. Since we’re feeling ourselves, we will not shy away from being bold and experimenting with different styles of expression, even acting through a leap of faith and believing the best in those we care about, regardless <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dating-red-flags"">of the red flags</a>.</p>



<p>Venus and Jupiter in Cancer bring luck on February 22nd. Both planets are two of the “greater benefics,” bringing positive energy and favorable news. Together, they can refine our ethics, promise abundance, offer security, and intensify our rizz. It encourages us to strive for the good life. We must listen to our gut. Intuition can be a lifesaver — now, more than ever. </p>



<p>Uranus in Taurus adds a streak of wildness and excitement to Venus’s cosmic mix on March 4th. If a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-situationship-relationship-dating-lessons"">situationship isn’t working</a>, we aren’t going to allow it to bring us down. We’ll break out and be free, helping us soar on the wings of love with someone who is worthy of our time. This could also mean that we are dating against our type to insert freshness into dating. And we lived happily ever after? Fingers crossed!</p>

<p>We know where <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/04/196438/nina-simone-rock-hall-induction-beyonce-tribute-lauryn-hill-sister-rosetta-tharpe"">Nina Simone</a> stood on political and social issues because she told us, vehemently, loudly, and often. She told us in her music with songs like “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ25-U3jNWM"">Mississippi Goddamn</a>” and her cover of “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-vBga68Xdc"">Strange Fruit</a>,” two songs about lynching and the brutalization of Black folks during the civil rights era. Simone made art like her purpose was pulsing through her, coursing through her veins and embedded in her bloodstream. It spilled out because it had to, she <em>had</em> to tell the world how she saw it and how it ought to be. <a href=""https://tribunemag.co.uk/2021/04/the-radical-politics-of-nina-simone"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">She told us explicitly</a> through quotes like the one that’s been making its rounds on social media lately: “An artist’s duty, as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times,” Simone said in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99V0mMNf5fo"">an interview from the ‘60s</a><em>. </em>“How can you be an artist and NOT reflect the times? That to me is the definition of an artist.”</p>



<p>The quote has been used so much it’s been flattened into a meme and lost some of its impact. But it’s never been more true that there are few artists in 2026 who are as committed to reflecting the times. Sixty years after Simone, then one of  the most notable singers in the world, used her voice to denounce systemic racism, critique capitalism, and unequivocally support the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/02/190444/black-panther-movies"">Black Panthers</a> and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/black-panther-style"">Black Power movement</a>, it’s hard to imagine more than a couple famous singers of her stature being as specific, bold, and unflinching in their activism and political outspokenness — within their music and outside of it. Silence is the standard. Sure, there are a few exceptions and after the Grammys, when multiple artists did speak out against <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/07/205854/abolish-ice-origins-twitter-undocumented-immigrants"">ICE (the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)</a>, and <a href=""https://www.newsweek.com/super-bowl-2026-bad-bunny-political-references-halftime-show-11487269"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bad Bunny’s blistering Super Bowl performance,</a> the energy seems to have shifted slightly. <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/bad-bunny-super-bowl-halftime-grammy-boy/story?id=129980775"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bad Bunny</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTCn2cmfEgA"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kehlani</a>, <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/best-new-artist-grammys-lost-brits-1236174909/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Olivia Dean,</a> <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2026-02-04/shaboozey-responds-grammys-speech-backlash"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shaboozey</a>, <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/sza-ice-grammys-1236170851/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">SZA</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2UnPnOYHNM"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Billie Eilish</a> all used their platforms at the Grammys to talk about how <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/presidential-debate-trump-harris-immigration"">ICE is dehumanizing immigrants</a> and terrorizing American communities. </p>



<p>To varying degrees of eloquence and effectiveness, these artists attempted to meet the moment at the Grammys, which came just a week after anti-ICE demonstrations erupted across the U.S. to protest the killings of <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/minneapolis-transformed-federal-immigration-alex-pretti-renee-good-rcna256032"">Renee Good and Alex Pretti</a> in Minneapolis by ICE agents. People are being ripped from their homes, killed in the streets, and rights are being stipped away in real time. It didn’t start with these two murders, but like George Floyd’s murder in 2020, we’re at an inflection point where people are finally, collectively saying ENOUGH. The celebrity statements at the Grammys were met with overwhelming support online and applause from the audience, like everyone was waiting for celebrities to finally <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2026/01/11954261/golden-globes-celebrity-pins-meaning-politics-speeches"">stop treating awards shows like it’s business as usual</a> and capitalize on the attention that comes with the stages they are afforded. For better and for worse, people want public figures to show us their values, to tell us where they stand, and if they have to engage in the pomp and circumstance of red carpets and awards shows while the world burns, the least they can do is acknowledge the flames.  </p>



<p>On the red carpet for the Golden Globes last month, I asked<em> <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTZH-OXCTkA/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Poker Face</a></em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTZH-OXCTkA/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> star Natasha Lyonne</a> about the “ICE OUT” pin she was wearing. She mentioned Renee Good by name. That interview garnered over six million views. And when I spoke to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTUB5W6jDwM/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">actress Jameela Jamil</a> on another red carpet about how she gets called “brave” when she speaks up about social issues while other celebs stay silent, she responded, “Am I brave or are they cowards?” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> For better and for worse, people want public figures to show us their values, to tell us where they stand, and if they have to engage in the pomp and circumstance of red carpets and awards shows while the world burns, the least they can do is acknowledge the flames.  </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Call it cowardice or bravery or anything in between, but what celebrities choose to say — or don’t — about the state of the world is always a hot topic. So, what do we <em>really</em> want to hear from artists in times of crisis? It may be too simple to say that every single celebrity should be performing their activism on social media or during awards speeches. A social post is the bare minimum. And many of these artists do not have the range to engage in a productive political debate. There are many different ways to support causes you care about, and if you have money, funding movements, giving to organizers on the ground, or to victims’ families can be more powerful than simply posting an Instagram story. I don’t think it’s a useful pastime to litigate what each celeb has or hasn’t said on their personal social media accounts. But two things can be true. And we live in a time when celebrities wield more power and access than ever, with legions of stans ready to act on command. We know that when famous artists do speak up, it works. </p>



<p>Taylor Swift <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2023/09/22/1201183160/taylor-swift-instagram-voter-registration"">increased voter registration by 23 per cent</a> (the number of 18-year-olds registered more than doubled) in 2023 with a non-partisan plea for her followers to vote. Swift is an example of someone who, despite making a documentary that was heavily about her decision to start <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2020/01/24/taylor-swift-politics-miss-americana-donald-trump"">speaking out against Donald Trump</a>, has chosen to remain neutral in a time that demands partiality. Telling fans to vote without making it clear that their basic rights and freedoms are on the line is like inviting people to dinner without telling them the menu is a choice between hot dogs and razor blades. One option ain’t great; the other will kill you. But most artists try to toe the line. On one hand, Beyoncé will deliver an album (and a <a href=""https://www.vice.com/en/article/a-black-panther-halftime-the-revolutionary-politics-behind-beyonces-super-bowl-performance/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Super Bowl halftime performance</a>) that can be interpreted as a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/04/11698236/beyonce-cowboy-carter-album-country-music-history-reaction"">searing critique of America</a> while highlighting oft-forgotten Black history and on the other, she’ll be spotted <a href=""https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/a/jadegomez510/beyonce-ivanka-jared-charity-dinner"">partying with members of an administration</a> hell bent on erasing that very history. In 2026, there are only a handful of celebrities who seem to be truly channeling the spirit of Simone. The rest opt into conversations about social justice when it’s comfortable, convenient, and popular. </p>



<p>The Grammys were proof of this. From the vague (Shaboozey) to the sincere (Olivia Dean and SZA) to the specific (Bad Bunny, Billie Eilish, and Kehlani), the show ended up being an unintentional showcase of the typical range of celebrity responses to social injustice. To be clear, I think it’s important and necessary that each of these artists chose to use their speeches to stand up for immigrants and stand against ICE. But if you are going to speak up, as <a href=""https://www.vulture.com/article/2026-grammys-review-politics.html"">Craig Jenkins put it for Vulture</a>, we’re going to need more “naming and shaming.” Jenkins wrote, “The ingredients for a broadcast that could brashly outline the regime connections in the building were in play, but any elephant in the room that was tacitly acknowledged was also rarely explicitly named and shamed.”</p>



<p>Take Shaboozey for example. “Immigrants built this country, literally. So this is for them,” the singer said as he accepted the Grammy for Best Country Group/Duo Performance. “For all children of immigrants, this is also for those who came to this country in search of better opportunities, to be part of a nation that promised freedom for all and equal opportunity to everyone willing to work for it.” It’s a nice sentiment, but Shaboozey didn’t say “ICE” once in his speech and his “immigrants built this country” line not only erases the labor of enslaved Black Americans, it also plays into the harmful idea that immigrants deserve to be treated fairly solely because of their labor instead of the fact that they are human beings. <a href=""https://people.com/shaboozey-addresses-backlash-immigrants-built-this-country-remark-grammys-speech-11899304"">Shaboozey has since apologized</a> and clarified his statements. I’m sure that the risk of receiving backlash for clumsy comments is why many stars refuse to say anything at all, but the stakes are too high to be scared of some silly social media fallout. Plus, the potential repercussions — like losing followers or brand deals — are trivial concerns compared to the violence people are facing at the hands of ICE, and in the wake of the Trump administration’s tyranny.</p>



<p>Someone who seems to understand this is Bad Bunny, and his career hasn’t suffered. Bad Bunny is also one of the few artists topping the charts in 2026 who actually incorporates his beliefs into his music — and he has for years. Bad Bunny speaks to the colonial violence America has enacted globally, and refuses to conform to the white supremacist ideals it continues to perpetuate. In a recent piece for NPR called “<a href=""https://www.npr.org/2026/02/05/nx-s1-5701460/where-are-the-protest-songs"">Where Are All The Protest Songs?</a>, Ann Powers writes, “Bad Bunny stands out in 2026 not only for his historic success as the first artist win album of the year for a Spanish-language album, but because DtMF does <a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/bad-bunny-debi-tirar-mas-fotos-political-lines-explained"">explicitly enact resistance</a> in songs like “LO QUE LE PASÓ A HAWAii,” calling out American imperialism, gentrification and the displacement of his fellow Puerto Ricans.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>It’s [Bad Bunny’s] clear-eyed consistency that should be the standard and the blueprint for artists who wish to put their actions and words behind their values.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In fact, Bad Bunny’s success hasn’t been hindered by his outspokenness, I think it’s added to it. Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio is unapologetically himself, a proud Puerto Rican, and someone who believes in the power of art to be political <em>and</em> personal. “Before I say thanks to God,” Bad Bunny said in his acceptance speech for Best Música Urbana Album, “I’m gonna say ICE out… We’re not savages, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans.” And when he won Album of the Year, Bad Bunny accepted in Spanish and dedicated his award to Puerto Rico. At the <a href=""https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-latin/bad-bunny-super-bowl-meaning-1235513218/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Super Bowl, Bad Bunny</a> displayed a sign that read, “The only thing more powerful than hate is love” and during “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TCX_Aqzoo4"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">El Apagón</a>,” a song which mentions the <a href=""https://www.providencejournal.com/story/entertainment/music/2022/09/19/bad-bunny-el-apagon-music-video-puerto-rico-hurricane-gentrification/10426694002/"">power grid issues Puerto Rico</a> has struggled with since Hurricane Maria (due in large part to the inaction of the U.S. government), the set featured Bad Bunny and dancers hanging from utility poles. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUhQmVDDZ0Z/?img_index=1&amp;igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="">Bad Bunny also listed countries</a> across Latin America, the Caribbean, and North America in his Super Bowl set, speaking to our diasporic connection and bookended his performance with holding up a football with the words, “<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUhQmVDDZ0Z/?img_index=1&amp;igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="">Together, We Are America</a>” scrawled on it, pushing the message that borders are imaginary and cultures are global. It was a moment that, as a Jamaican Canadian currently living in the U.S., brought me to tears. That’s only scratching the surface of the symbolism and spirit of revolt that Bad Bunny brought to the Super Bowl. When it was time to step up and say something, he did it with authenticity, integrity, history, conviction, and clarity. It’s this clear-eyed consistency that should be the standard and the blueprint for artists who wish to put their actions and words behind their values.</p>



<p>Of course, if the ask is for celebrities to show us their values, some of them will also show us their asses. Despite being dubbed “MAGA Barbie,” Sydney Sweeney has yet to specifically denounce the actions of the party she’s associated with (Sweeney is reportedly a registered Republican). In a <a href=""https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a70001220/sydney-sweeney-interview-2026/"">recent interview with Cosmopolitan</a>, Sweeney said, “I’ve never been here to talk about politics. I’ve always been here to make art, so this is just not a conversation I want to be at the forefront of. And I think because of that, people want to take it even further and use me as their own pawn. But it’s somebody else assigning something to me, and I can’t control that.” Later <a href=""https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a70001220/sydney-sweeney-interview-2026/"">in the Q&amp;A</a>, Sweeny vaguely defines her beliefs as being rooted in love by saying, “I’m not a hateful person” and doubles down on the idea that art is not political. </p>



<p>“I’m not a political person. I’m in the arts. I’m not here to speak on politics. That’s not an area I’ve ever even imagined getting into. It’s not why I became who I am,” Sweeney told Cosmo. “I became an actor because I like to tell stories, but I don’t believe in hate in any form.” These statements are genuinely so stupid, I almost don’t want to give them the dignity of a rebuttal. The last time <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/08/11924722/sydney-sweeney-american-eagle-ad-controversy-republican-trump"">I wrote about Sweeney</a>, I swore it was the last time. But this notion that entertainment and politics should be segregated, that one has no bearing on the other and vice versa, isn’t just a false belief held by Sweeney to justify her inability to emphatically condemn an image of herself she helped create. Since the Grammys, the sentiment has been echoed by <a href=""https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/celebrity/articles/why-don-t-stfu-mark-130425855.html"">Kevin O’Leary</a> and <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/ricky-gervais-celebrities-leave-politics-out-speeches-grammys-1236494483/"">Ricky Gervais</a>, two old white men no one should be paying attention to and yet, here we are. </p>



<p><a href=""https://ca.news.yahoo.com/kevin-oleary-slams-billie-eilish-173347556.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">O’Leary posted that Eilish</a> should “STFU [shut the f-ck up]” after she said “No one is illegal on stolen land” in her <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2UnPnOYHNM"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">speech accepting the Grammy for Song of the Year</a>. “I feel like we just need to keep fighting and speaking up and protesting, and our voices really do matter, and the people matter, and fuck ICE,” Eilish continued. Based on their recent statements, Sweeney, O’Leary, and Gervais seem to agree that the artists who spoke up at the Grammys should just “shut up and sing.” But art <em>is</em> political and it always has been. Every piece of art – a song, a movie, a TV show, an album — is created within the social context of its time. Sweeney ran an unsuccessful Oscar campaign for playing an abused lesbian boxer in <em>Christy</em>. Victims of domestic violence and members of the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk3lT_r0MYA"">LGBTQ community</a> are two vulnerable groups whose <a href=""https://time.com/7332225/domestic-violence-victims-shelter-trump-immigration/"">legal protections have been under attack</a> since Trump was elected again. </p>



<p>And while art has been used by governments to weaponize, propagandize, and manipulate populations, it has also been suppressed and censored to shut down resistance. Art can be a joyful act of defiance and a powerful instrument of protest. When Sweeney calls herself a storyteller without acknowledging how stories can push narratives, preserve history, propel representation forward or stereotype entire demographics, she’s either being wilfully ignorant or just illiterate (literacy is another example about how art is political). And when artists use art to lure in victims or cover up their crimes (R. Kelly, Bill Cosby, Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood elite in the Epstein files, I could go on), it’s impossible to say that the two are unconnected. </p>



<p>At the Grammys, country singer<a href=""https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/music/articles/jelly-roll-allegedly-confronted-reporter-185644570.html""> Jelly Roll came under fire</a> for proclaiming that “people shouldn’t care to hear my opinion” because he’s “a dumb redneck.” This is also a common refrain from celebrities (and influencers). They claim not to be informed enough to speak on current events. If they are going to be given microphones, you’d think they’d put some thought and care into what they are going to say into it. There is a responsibility that comes with fame and feigning cluelessness isn’t a good excuse, it’s a copout. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVP_fXt51Y"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jelly Roll can speak about Jesus</a> and preach about his religion, but he refuses to interrogate the teachings in the very Bible he totes around in order to stand up for the basic human rights of his neighbors. Jelly Roll’s comments probably didn’t come as a surprise. He’s a white country star and the genre tends to lean heavily conservative. The music industry is a business, and when the majority of your fan base is Republican, artists aren’t staying silent out of ignorance, they are choosing money over morals. </p>



<p>Money is the only explanation for <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/feb/06/nicki-minaj-maga-era-barbz-defend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nicki Minaj’s recent behavior</a> — even though her fanbase is overwhelmingly queer and Black. In the past, the Trinidad-born, New York-raised rapper hailed herself as a proud immigrant standing in opposition to Donald Trump’s immigration policies. Now, she’s full MAGA. “I am probably the president’s number one fan, and that’s not going to change,” Minaj said last week at the<a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/trump-accounts-nicki-minaj.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> U.S. Treasury Department’s Trump Accounts Summit</a>. “And the hate, or what people have to say, does not affect me at all.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> My wish is for these artists to continue to speak up, not just when two white people are murdered and the country deems it socially acceptable to say something. And not just when it’s comfortable. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Along with holding hands with Trump (shudder), Minaj “thanked the president for getting her a Trump Gold Card, a kind of visa for wealthy foreigners to help them secure expedited U.S. residency,” <a href=""https://slate.com/culture/2026/02/nicki-minaj-trump-gold-card-husband-citizen-grammys-trevor-noah-don-lemon.html"">according to Slate</a>. “The visa normally requires a <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4q1lddj8go?accountMarketingPreferences=off"">$1 million contribution, plus fees</a>; Minaj… nabbed the Trump Gold Card for free.” There’s conflicting reports as to whether Minaj’s visa is legit, but it’s clear that cozying up to Trump is for her own personal gain. As digital creator and educator <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DUZnISvjqZl/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="">Raven Schwam-Curtis says in a video</a> posted to her @ravenreveals account, Minaj “has chosen to side with a president that uses the optics of Black women as ‘proof’ that his regime is doing good things for our communities while actively harming us,” she says. “Representation doesn’t equal liberation or solidarity. If anything it shows how easily representation can be weaponized by the right when your class position pulls you out of solidarity with regular Black folk.” Through her art, Minaj gained wealth, status, and standom that she has now leveraged to push her far-right agenda. And <a href=""https://www.newsweek.com/nicki-minaj-fans-barbz-vote-republican-trump-11482667"">according to Newsweek</a>, legions of Minaj’s fans, dubbed “Barbz” are following her pivot to the Republican Party. </p>



<p>It’s already problematic that we live in a time where celeb worship is at an all-time high. We shouldn’t be looking to these people to tell us what to believe, but they are influential, whether we want them to be or not. If Minaj and Bad Bunny stand at two opposite ends of the celebs speaking up politically spectrum, they each represent the <em>dos</em> and <em>don’ts</em> of celebrity political activism. One is emphasizing how culture and community can combat oppressive regimes (Benito) and the other is proof that conformity and greed can make you complicit in upholding them (Minaj).</p>



<p>The Grammys, and the Super Bowl halftime show, served as hopeful examples of celebrities meeting the moment, even though they both still exist within institutions that sustain the status quo. My wish is for these artists — and anyone with a platform — to continue to speak up, not just when two white people are murdered and the country deems it socially acceptable to say something. And not just when it’s comfortable. Like Bad Bunny and Kehlani (who has been a <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@varietymagazine/video/7508887896628219178"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pro-Palestinian advocate</a> in her music as well as on social media), my hope for all public figures to use every avenue of their influence to try to shake the table and push back against powerful people who aim to snuff out dissension and stifle diversity.</p>



<p>“We’re too powerful of a group to all be in a room at the same time and not make some kind of a statement in our country,” Kehlani <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suQNZoLVrdE"">told the Hollywood Reporter</a> on the red carpet at the Grammys. “I hope everybody’s inspired to join together as a community of artists and speak out against what’s going on, and I’mma leave this and say “‘Fuck ICE,’” she echoed during her speech. </p>



<p>I started this piece by quoting Nina Simone and as cliche as it may be, I’m going to end it the same way. Because Simone was decades before her time. And every artist (including actresses like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DURBiKkEoQZ/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kerry Washington</a>, <a href=""https://iop.harvard.edu/events/artist-public-life-sophia-bush-activism-artistry-and-courage-speak"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sophia Bush</a>, and <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hacks-star-hannah-einbinder-criticized-ice-shouted-free-palestine-emmy-rcna231320"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hannah Einbinder</a>) who dedicate their platforms to advocacy for those whose voices need to be heard, are doing so because of the path Simone, and others like her, paved. I think their legacy should be more than just memes. So, I’ll leave you with Nina Simone’s full quote: </p>



<p><em>“An artist’s duty, as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times. I think that is true of painters, sculptors, poets, musicians. As far as I’m concerned, it’s their choice, but I choose to reflect the times and situations in which I find myself. That, to me, is my duty. And at this crucial time in our lives, when everything is so desperate, when everyday is a matter of survival, I don’t think you can help but be involved. Young people, black and white, know this. That’s why they’re so involved in politics. We will shape and mold this country or it will not be molded and shaped at all anymore. So I don’t think you have a choice. How can you be an artist and NOT reflect the times? That to me is the definition of an artist.”</em></p>

<p>Cosmic beings, this week opens with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, a liminal checkpoint between what has already climaxed and what is about to be reborn. Last quarter moons are not about manifesting or initiating, they’re about editing. This one asks us to release what the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-full-snow-moon-in-leo-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Leo Full Moon</a> revealed is no longer sustainable, especially around power, control, emotional attachments, and unspoken resentments. You may encounter small speed bumps, emotional flare-ups, or moments of resistance. Instead of pushing through, pause and ask yourself: <em>What am I being asked to let go of so I don’t carry it into the eclipse?</em> Scorpio energy reminds us that release is rarely neat, but it is necessary.</p>



<p>Midweek, the emotional tone softens as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, a placement where Venus feels especially at home. Under this transit, compassion rises and defensiveness melts. With Mercury already in Pisces, conversations become more heart-centered, intuitive, and emotionally nuanced. This is a powerful week for forgiveness, creative expression, spiritual connection, and choosing love over fear, not in a bypassing way, but in a grounded, human one. As Pluto continues its work in Aquarius, reshaping collective systems and futures, Venus in Pisces reminds us that revolution without tenderness is unsustainable.</p>



<p>The emotional and spiritual weight of the week peaks on February 13th, when Saturn leaves Pisces and enters Aries, closing a chapter that began in March 2023. Cosmic beings, give yourselves credit. Saturn in Pisces asked for surrender, boundary repair, grief work, and deep spiritual accountability. Its exit may bring relief, but also unexpected emotion. This is the final full week of the Year of the Snake, and grief can surface alongside excitement.</p>



<p>Saturn in Aries begins a brand-new 29-year cycle at the very start of the zodiac, but this is <em>not </em>a race. With Mercury approaching its retrograde shadow and eclipse season arriving next week, this remains an in-between time. The momentum is real, but so is the need for gentleness. Trust that the tides are turning. You’re allowed to move forward slowly, intentionally, and with love for both yourself and the collective you’re helping to shape.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, this week begins with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, activating your sector of intimacy, shared resources, emotional debts, and energetic entanglements. For you, this is a clearing moment. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-diary"">Something tied to money</a>, power dynamics, trust, or emotional obligation is ready to be released. You may realize you’ve been carrying responsibility that isn’t actually yours, or holding on out of loyalty rather than alignment. The discomfort here is real, but so is the relief. This is about lightening your load before the eclipse ahead, not pushing through out of pride.</p>



<p>On February 10th, Venus enters Pisces, joining Mercury in your spirituality, rest, and closure sector. This is a softer, quieter shift that asks you to slow your pace emotionally, even if your external life feels busy. You may feel more reflective, nostalgic, or open-hearted than usual. Old feelings, dreams, or memories can resurface, not to distract you, but to be integrated. This is a beautiful time for forgiveness, creative flow, and releasing what you no longer need to carry into your next chapter. You don’t have to fix everything this week. Some things resolve through compassion, not effort.</p>



<p>The major moment arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters your sign, beginning a brand-new 29-year cycle for Saturn and a defining chapter for you. Having Saturn in your sign is not always easy. It brings accountability, responsibility, and a mirror that asks you to take yourself seriously. You may feel more visible, more scrutinized, or more aware of the weight of your choices. But here’s the balance: Neptune is also in your sign, softening Saturn’s edges with vision, faith, and imagination. This combination asks you to build your dreams in real time. The spotlight is on you now, yes, but this is not about perfection. It’s about integrity. With great power comes great responsibility, and this week reminds you that you’re more than capable of rising to both.</p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, are you ready for a more social, emotionally open week than you’re used to? The energy shifts fast, starting with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, which activates your partnership and one-on-one relationship sector. This is a release point around dynamics that feel intense, imbalanced, or emotionally draining. A pattern in a close relationship may become impossible to ignore, not to provoke drama, but to help <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/casual-relationship-rules-boundaries"">you reset boundaries</a>. The invitation is to let go of power struggles and choose honesty over control. What you release now creates space for healthier connections moving forward. Midweek, the tone softens as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in your friendship, community, and technology sector. This is a beautiful shift for you.</p>



<p>Conversations feel warmer, connections more compassionate, and social interactions less transactional. You may feel drawn to collaborate, reconnect with friends, or show up more authentically online. Creativity flows more easily when you’re surrounded by people who genuinely support you. Just be mindful of over-giving… Pisces energy loves to merge, but your energy is still precious.</p>



<p>The biggest shift of the week arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating your spirituality, healing, and subconscious sector. This begins a longer chapter of inner work, emotional accountability, and spiritual discipline. You may feel called to take your mental health, rest, or healing practices more seriously. While Saturn here can feel heavy at times, remember that Neptune is also in Aries, softening the experience by reminding you that healing doesn’t have to be harsh. This is about building trust with yourself, honoring your intuition, and releasing old fears gently rather than forcefully.</p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, are you ready to clean up your schedule and your energy at the same time? The week begins with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, activating your work, routines, and well-being sector. This is a checkpoint moment where something about your daily life clearly isn’t working anymore. You may notice burnout creeping in, ineffciencies piling up, or commitments that drain more than they give. Instead of pushing harder, this moon asks you to subtract. Let go of habits, tasks, or expectations that don’t actually support your health or focus.</p>



<p>On February 10th, the vibe shifts as Venus enters Pisces, joining Mercury in your career and public image sector. Suddenly, conversations at work feel softer, more emotionally intelligent, and less transactional. This is a great week to lead with empathy, creativity, and intuition rather than trying to logic your way through everything. You may feel more visible professionally or inspired to align your work with something meaningful. Just watch the tendency to overpromise. Pisces energy is generous, but clarity still matters.</p>



<p>The biggest internal shift comes on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating your friendship, community, and long-term goals sector. This begins a period where you’re asked to take your dreams and social connections more seriously. Saturn here can feel like a reality check around who you’re building with and which visions are actually sustainable. Neptune’s presence in Aries softens the edges, reminding you that purpose and imagination can coexist. This is about committing to goals and communities that feel aligned, not just exciting.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955474.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cancer, are you ready to get honest about what actually brings you joy versus what just looks good on the surface? The week opens with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, activating your creativity, pleasure, and self-expression sector. This is a release point around old patterns in romance, fun, or creative pursuits that no longer feel nourishing. You may realize that certain ways of seeking validation or distraction aren’t giving you the fulfillment you crave. Letting go here creates space for joy that feels more genuine and less performative.</p>



<p>Midweek, the energy lifts as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in your expansion, travel, and belief sector. This is a beautiful alignment for you, bringing emotional ease, inspiration, and a renewed sense of faith. You may feel called to learn something new, plan a trip, or reconnect with a spiritual practice that grounds you. Conversations feel more hopeful and heart-centered. This is a reminder that growth doesn’t have to be stressful. It can feel gentle and meaningful at the same time.</p>



<p>The most important shift arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating your career and public life sector.

This is not about hardening yourself. It’s about building something meaningful without losing your heart.</p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, are you ready to soften without feeling like you’re giving up your power? The week begins with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, moving through the part of your life connected to home, emotional roots, and private foundations. This is a release moment around family dynamics, living situations, or emotional patterns that have been quietly influencing your decisions. You may feel called to let go of an old story about where you come from or what safety is supposed to look like. It’s not about cutting ties dramatically, it’s about loosening emotional grips that keep you from feeling fully free.</p>



<p>Midweek, the energy deepens as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the realm of intimacy, shared resources, and emotional merging. Conversations may turn more vulnerable, and you might feel more open to trust, heal, or share parts of yourself you usually keep guarded. This is a powerful time for emotional honesty, but also for discernment. Compassion doesn’t mean overextending yourself. Let closeness feel mutual, not draining.</p>

<h2>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Virgo, are you ready to stop explaining yourself and start trusting what you already know? The week opens with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, moving through the part of your life connected to communication, thought patterns, and daily exchanges. This is a release moment around how you speak to yourself and others. You may notice mental habits, assumptions, or conversations that feel draining or unnecessary. The invitation is to let go of overthinking and choose clarity over control. Not every thought deserves your attention.</p>



<p>Midweek brings a relational softening as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the zone of partnerships, collaboration, and one-on-one dynamics. This is a heart-opening influence that encourages empathy, compassion, and emotional presence in your closest connections. Conversations may feel more tender or vulnerable, and you may crave emotional attunement over logic. This is beautiful territory for healing, but remember to keep your boundaries intact. Connection doesn’t require self-erasure.</p>

<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Libra, are you ready to get clear about what you truly value, not just what keeps the peace? The week opens with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, moving through the area of your life connected to money, self-worth, and personal resources. This is a release point around financial habits, energetic exchanges, or beliefs about what you deserve. You may realize that something you’ve been tolerating out of comfort or fear is no longer aligned. Letting go here creates space for more intentional stability.</p>



<p>Midweek, the tone softens as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the part of your life tied to daily routines, work rhythms, and well-being. This is an invitation to bring more compassion into how you treat yourself day to day. You may feel drawn to slow down, care for your body, or approach work with more heart and less pressure. Productivity looks different under Pisces energy. It’s about flow, not force.</p>



<p>The major shift arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating your relationship and partnership realm. This begins a longer chapter where commitments, boundaries, and mutual responsibility take center stage.

<div id=""scorpio""></div>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, are you ready to release the version of yourself that’s been holding it all together a little <em>too </em>tightly? The week begins with the Last Quarter Moon in your sign, moving through the core of your identity, body, and emotional truth. This is a powerful shedding moment. You may feel more sensitive, introspective, or aware of patterns you’ve outgrown. Something about how you show up in the world is ready to change, not through force, but through honesty. Let go of the need to control the narrative. What’s real will remain.</p>



<p>Midweek, the energy softens as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the area of your life tied to creativity, romance, pleasure, and self-expression. This is a beautiful counterbalance to the intensity you’re feeling. Inspiration flows more easily, and emotional connections feel sweeter and less guarded. You may feel drawn to art, intimacy, or moments of joy that don’t require explanation. Let yourself enjoy this. Healing doesn’t always come from doing the work… sometimes it comes from remembering how to play.</p>



<p>The biggest shift of the week arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating the realm of your life connected to work, health, and daily responsibilities. This begins a longer chapter of learning how to structure your life in a way that actually supports your energy. Saturn asks for discipline and accountability, while Neptune in Aries adds sensitivity and intuition. You’re learning how to work smarter, not harder, and how to honor your limits without guilt. This week reminds you that power doesn’t come from endurance alone, it comes from sustainability.</p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, are you ready to slow down just enough to actually hear <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-intuition-gut-instinct-personal-safety"">what your intuition</a> has been trying to tell you? The week opens with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, moving through the part of your life tied to rest, closure, and subconscious patterns. This is a behind-the-scenes release moment. You may feel more tired, reflective, or emotionally porous than usual, and that’s not a weakness. It’s information. Let go of habits, expectations, or internal pressure that keep you running on autopilot. This is a reset, not a setback.</p>



<p>Midweek brings a softer, more nurturing tone as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the area of your life connected to home, family, and emotional grounding. You may crave comfort, familiarity, or deeper emotional safety. Conversations with loved ones can feel more tender and healing, and you may feel inspired to make your space feel more like a sanctuary. Just be mindful of nostalgia pulling you backward instead of helping you integrate. Comfort is meant to restore you, not stall you.</p>



<p>The biggest shift arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating the realm of creativity, joy, romance, and self-expression. This begins a longer chapter of taking what lights you up more seriously. Saturn asks you to commit to your passions, not just chase excitement. Neptune’s presence in Aries keeps the magic alive, reminding you that discipline doesn’t have to kill the fun. This week sets the tone for building a life that feels inspired <em>and </em>sustainable.</p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, are you noticing how your definition of success is quietly changing? The week begins with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, moving through the part of your life connected to friendships, community ties, and long-term aspirations. This is a release moment around social dynamics or goals that no longer feel aligned with who you’re becoming. You may realize that certain group spaces, collaborations, or dreams need updating. Letting go here isn’t a failure, it’s refinement. You’re making room for more meaningful connections and intentions.</p>



<p>Midweek, the energy softens as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the realm of communication, learning, and everyday exchanges. Conversations feel more heartfelt and less transactional, and you may find yourself speaking from intuition rather than strategy. This is a supportive time for writing, teaching, or reconnecting with people you haven’t spoken to in a while. Just be mindful of mixed signals. Clarity still matters, even when compassion leads.</p>



<p>The major shift arrives on February 13th, when Saturn, your ruling planet, re-enters Aries, activating the area of your life tied to home, family, and emotional foundations.

You may feel called to restructure your private life, redefine stability, or take emotional boundaries more seriously. With Neptune also in Aries, this process is softened by imagination and sensitivity. You’re learning that true authority comes from being grounded internally, not just accomplished externally.</p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, are you ready to get honest about what kind of future you actually want to build, not just talk about? The week begins with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, activating the part of your life connected to career, reputation, and long-term direction. This is a release moment around professional expectations, public roles, or ambitions that no longer reflect who you are becoming. You may feel tension between where you’ve been visible and where you actually want to invest your energy. Letting go here isn’t dramatic, it’s strategic. You’re clearing space before a major reset.</p>



<p>Midweek brings a shift in tone as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the realm of money, values, and self-worth. This softens your relationship with security and abundance, encouraging you to lead with intuition rather than anxiety. You may feel more compassionate toward yourself around finances or more open to receiving support. Creative or spiritually aligned income ideas can surface now. Just stay mindful of boundaries. Generosity is beautiful, but it shouldn’t come at the expense of stability.</p>



<p>The biggest shift of the week arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating your communication, mindset, and learning zone.

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, are you ready to honor how far you’ve come instead of focusing on how much more there is to do? The week opens with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, moving through the area of your life tied to growth, faith, and perspective. This is a release moment around outdated beliefs, limiting narratives, or paths you once thought you <em>had </em>to follow. You may feel called to let go of a version of the future that no longer resonates. Trust that releasing an old vision makes room for something more aligned to take shape.</p>



<p>Midweek brings a beautiful homecoming as Venus enters your sign on February 10th, joining Mercury already there. This softens everything. You’re more magnetic, intuitive, and emotionally open, and others are more receptive to your presence. This is a time for connection, creativity, self-care, and gentle honesty. Just be mindful of over-giving or absorbing other people’s emotions. Compassion is your gift, but boundaries are your anchor.</p>



<p>The biggest energetic shift arrives on February 13th, when Saturn leaves your sign and enters Aries, ending a demanding chapter that began in 2023. This week, you may feel both relief and reflection. Saturn in Aries activates your relationship with money, values, and self-worth, beginning a new phase of building stability from a more empowered place. With Neptune also in Aries, dreaming and doing begin to work together. This week reminds you that softness and strength are not opposites. You’re learning how to build a life that supports both.</p>

<p>The latest text in a group chat with a few of my beauty editor peers reads: “Can we stop pretending that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sacheu-stayn-lip-liner-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">lip liner stains</a> are good?” I get it. While TikTok’s beauty enthusiasts would have you believe they’re the best thing since sliced bread — sculpting and staying put for hours on end — those videos are often edited and carefully curated. From drugstore launches to luxury versions, most lip liner stains I’ve tried apply patchy, suck the moisture out of my lips, and flake off by midday. Not even the viral <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/huda-beauty-lip-contour-stain-controversy"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Huda Beauty Lip Contour Stain</a> could convert <em>this </em>naysayer. </p>



<p>But I’ll eat my words, because a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP520759"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">new launch from Summer Fridays</a> — my favorite lip care brand — is changing everything I thought I knew about this notoriously finicky product. </p>



<h2>What is Summer Fridays’ Flushed Lip Stain, and what are the benefits? </h2>



<p>Just this week, Summer Fridays unveiled its <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP520759"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Flushed Lip Stain</a>, a long-wear pen that works as both a lip liner and an all-over stain. The range includes six shades, from Almond, a soft neutral brown, to Plum, a deep berry hue.  </p>



<p>What immediately sets this liner apart is the angled felt-tip nib, which makes sculpting and defining lips a breeze. Unlike other pens, it’s not scratchy — you can even create a full lip look by applying it all over, then topping with a swipe of gloss. </p>



<p>Besides the unique shape, Summer Fridays claims that the formula is transfer-proof, buildable, and non-drying. The latter caught my eye, especially because most pen liners are so drying, they make my lips feel tight and itchy. But this one doesn’t, thanks to a handful of smart skincare ingredients. </p>



<p>First, aloe vera gel, which I’m convinced gives the pen more slip, preventing it from snagging. Then there’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vitamin-b5-hyaluronic-acid-serum-combination"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">panthenol, a skincare ingredient</a> that dermatologists rate for boosting hydration and supporting the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-soothing-barrier-support-serum-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">skin barrier</a>, essentially the outermost layer of skin that keeps good stuff in (like moisture) and bad stuff out (like bacteria). Since lip skin is thinner than elsewhere, these plumping, moisture-locking ingredients are especially welcome. </p>

<h2>What makes the Summer Fridays Flushed Lip Stain special? </h2>



<p>This is the sort of product that makes me want to earn a degree in cosmetic chemistry to understand why it works so well. Unlike others, it’s not immediately soaking wet, so it doesn’t run, drip, or require a futile clean-up operation. Instead, it’s so precise that it feels almost like using a pencil liner to trace my lip line. That said, there are a few seconds of blending time. Some lip stains dry instantly, but I use my finger or a fluffy brush to blur this slightly for a natural, lived-in effect rather than harsh lines. </p>



<p>For a seamless lip look, I recommend pairing the stain with a gloss or balm in a similar shade. My favorite combos <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fsummer-fridays-flushed-lip-stain-P520759%3FskuId%3D2940476%26icid2%3Dproducts%2520grid%3Ap520759%3Aproduct"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">are Almond</a> with <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsummerfridays.com%2Fproducts%2Flip-butter-balm-hot-cocoa"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Summer Fridays Lip Butter Balm in Hot Cocoa</a>, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fsummer-fridays-flushed-lip-stain-P520759%3FskuId%3D2940385%26icid2%3Dproducts%2520grid%3Ap520759%3Aproduct"">Rosette</a> with <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP515960%3FskuId%3D2874287"">Glow Recipe Glass Balm in Blackberry Bingsoo</a>. Adding a gloss or balm on top further blurs the lip line, making lips look naturally defined, not obviously drawn on. </p>



<p>I’m a big tea drinker, and the only thing that transfers onto the mug is the gloss. On me, this stain stays pretty much intact for around six hours before I even think about topping up, and I can still see the ghost of it at the end of the day. Happily, I never need to scrub to remove it; I use <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fskinactive-micellar-cleansing-water-all-in-1-cleanser-makeup-remover-xlsImpprod13531031%3Fsku%3D2298445"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water</a> on a cotton round and swipe gently.

<p>• Available in six shades to suit all skin tones: Almond, Plum, Mocha, Maple, Rosette, and Slipper. </p>



<p>• The transfer-proof formula is buildable, depending on how opaque you want it. </p>



<p>• Features a soft, tapered felt-tip nib for precise application. </p>

<h2>Is the Summer Fridays Flushed Lip Stain worth it? </h2>



<p>My makeup bag is a dumping ground for lip liner stains that have disappointed me, but these have their own special jar. On days when I know I won’t have time to keep my lipstick topped up, I apply this all over and finish with a balm, which gives a satin-like lipstick effect. </p>



<p>To really get the most out of a lip liner stain like this, prep is key. My lips are always the last step in my makeup routine, so before I even start, I apply a thick layer of moisturizer (or eye cream — trust me, it works!) to soften them. When it’s time to line, I use a tissue to blot away as much as I can, and that’s when I go in with the product — applying it to lips that are naked but moisturized. (I’m a firm believer that moisturized lips hold onto pigments far better than parched ones.) Lip balm or gloss can be a little too thick, and in this case, the pigment might not cling as well.  </p>



<p>Lastly, I’ve found that these stains dry out far less quickly than others, but I like to store them upside down, so the formula is always ready when I go to line my lips. </p>

The guest room is the last room in our apartment that hasn’t had a makeover since we moved in over two years ago, so I decided 2026 was the year I was going to make it happen. I’ve decided on a pale blue and brown color scheme, and when I found this brown and striped duvet cover on Zara, I instantly knew that it was the look I wanted to go for.  <br /><br /><strong>Zara Home</strong> Cotton Duvet Cover, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zara.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Ffaded-striped-cotton-duvet-cover-p46161088.html%3Fv1%3D495441508%26v2%3D2524964"">Zara</a><span class=""copyright"">Image Courtesy of Zara </span></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""5712"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957615.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=4284&amp;height=5712&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=3:4"" width=""4284"" /><figcaption><h3>Raquel Reichard, Deputy Director of Somos</h3></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1322"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957690.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1342&amp;height=1322&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=671:661"" width=""1342"" /><figcaption>The primary reason I’ve dashed to my iPhone after work to place my UberEats order is, simply, because of time. As a full-time editor and author, often the last thing I want to do after a long day (or that I have time to do in my post-work schedule) is prepare myself a delicious and nourishing meal. So, like a growing number of people around the country, I’m meal-prepping. Currently, I’m using Williams <a href=""https://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/hold-everything-glass-containers-with-lids-14-piece-set/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sonoma’s Hold Everything Glass Food Storage Containers</a>, a 14-piece set with both rectangular and round containers that easily store full meals as well as core ingredients for salads, pastas, rice bowls, and more. As I work to minimize my use of plastic, I appreciate that they’re made of glass, feature silicone gaskets to keep them airtight, and are refrigerator-, freezer-, and dishwasher-safe. <br /><br /><strong>Williams Sonoma</strong> Hold Everything Glass Food Storage Containers, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.williams-sonoma.com%2Fproducts%2Fhold-everything-glass-containers-with-lids-14-piece-set%2F"">Williams Sonoma</a><span class=""copyright"">Image Courtesy of Sonoma </span></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""800"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957695.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1318&amp;height=800&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=659:400"" width=""1318"" /><figcaption>My main goal for 2026 is to save money, and that means I must significantly cut down on where my variable expenses have been going: eating out. That said, I’m doing everything I can to make cooking at home as seamless as possible. And as a single girl who lives alone, that means using cookware that’s less daunting, pots and pans that are perfect for smaller meals and have easier cleanup. Right now, I’m loving <a href=""https://fromourplace.com/products/mini-cookware-duo"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Our Place’s Mini Cookware Duo</a>, which includes a mini Always Pan and mini Perfect Pot. This multifunctional, non-stick ceramic, and truly beautiful (mine is in the off-white color Steam) cookware has allowed me to make just the right amount of food for the week and easily reheat leftovers when I need to.  <br /><br /><strong>Our Place</strong> Mini Cookware Duo, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffromourplace.com%2Fproducts%2Fmini-cookware-duo"">Our Place</a><span class=""copyright"">Image Courtesy of Our Place </span></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1152"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957700.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1038&amp;height=1152&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=173:192"" width=""1038"" /><figcaption>Also saving me time in the kitchen is the <a href=""https://www.sharkninja.com/ninja-crispi-pro-6-in-1-countertop-glass-air-fryer-bone/AS101LG.html?dwvar_AS101LG_color=e7e6e1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ninja Crispi® Pro 6-in-1 Countertop Glass Air Fryer</a>. It roasts, reheats, crisps, and even bakes faster and easier than a stove or oven. With two containers, one sized at 2.5 quarts and another at 6 quarts, I can easily swap between them depending on whether I’m cooking for one or hosting family and friends. This model saves me even more time because it cooks and bakes in a glass bowl that comes with an airtight lid, making storage and reheating as simple as moving it in and out of the refrigerator. But my absolute favorite part is how easy the non-toxic glass is to clean. I can simply remove the bowl and wash it in the sink, no need to scrub to remove grease from trapped crevices or coatings. That also helps to keep the appliance looking polished on my countertop. <br /><br /><strong>Ninja</strong> Ninja Crispi® Pro 6-in-1 Air Fryer, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fninja-crispi-pro-6-in-1-countertop-glass-air-fryer-bone%2FAS101LG.html%3Fdwvar_AS101LG_color%3De7e6e1"">Ninja</a><span class=""copyright"">Image Courtesy of Ninja </span></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""5712"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957828.jpeg?auto=webp&amp;width=4284&amp;height=5712&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=3:4"" width=""4284"" /><figcaption><h3>Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer</h3></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""984"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957705.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1166&amp;height=984&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=583:492"" width=""1166"" /><figcaption>I’m fully in my cozy era, and this <a href=""https://www.target.com/p/faux-shearling-bed-rest-pillow-room-essentials/-/A-90789939?preselect=81781520&amp;clkid=7b5a2284N011d11f1886cd72cae7825f4&amp;cpng=PTID1&amp;TCID=AFL-7b5a2284N011d11f1886cd72cae7825f4&amp;afsrc=1&amp;lnm=81938&amp;afid=R29%2C%20LLC&amp;ref=tgt_adv_xasd0002#lnk=sametab"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">under-$20 Target boyfriend pillow</a> has absolutely leveled up my at-home nesting game.
