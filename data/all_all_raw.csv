<p>As environmental accountability becomes embedded in design culture, the building envelope is being reconsidered not just as a protective skin, but as an active energy-producing surface. Treating solar technology as a material rather than an attachment reshapes how architecture is conceived and detailed. Color, texture, rhythm, and assembly become inseparable from performance. Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) operate within this expanded definition of materiality. By integrating solar technology into façades and rainscreens from the earliest project stages, architects can reduce redundancy, align energy goals with design intent, and rethink how envelopes are composed. Yet translating this ambition into buildable systems requires technical precision and construction intelligence.</p>",

<p><em>Project Background and Site Understanding</em> — The site is located on an elevated riverside plot along the Wuxi River in Wangcunkou Town, Suichang County, Zhejiang Province, descending toward a natural stone riverbank. Historically, it served as an important water transportation dock during the Ming and Qing dynasties and later became an active area of revolutionary history. With the shift of time, the site has remained abandoned for many years. Although the village is structured along the river, most of the riverbank is occupied by residential buildings, leaving little public access to the water. The renovated house sits between a small plaza and the riverbank, and its enclosed condition had long blocked villagers' approach to the water. The design goal therefore emerged clearly: to transform ""separation"" into ""connection"" by renewing the old house and releasing an openly accessible waterfront public space for the community.</p>",

<p>Aqqu Central Café is an architectural regeneration project that restores a legendary landmark of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/almaty"">Almaty</a> from the 1960s.

The design is entirely dedicated to restoring the city's visual memory through a modern interpretation of 1960s modernism. The conceptual starting point for the project was a vibrant swan mosaic created by local artist Anastasia Zharko. Its bright palette of blue, yellow, red, and burgundy served as the foundation for every color selection throughout the interior.</p>",

<p>The <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/roberval"">Roberval</a> Courthouse is set within an exceptional natural site, at the heart of the historic downtown, at the meeting point between a heritage urban fabric and the lakeshore landscape of Lac Saint-Jean. This context revealed both strong potential and complex challenges for the project: restoring a fragile century-old building, repairing past interventions that had severed its relationship with the lake, modernizing judicial spaces, integrating a substantial expansion without compromising the building's symbolic value, and improving accessibility and security.</p>",

<p>Unit 20, located in the heart of Mtatsminda, continues a series of projects that reconsider what it means to design for the contemporary rental market and, in this case, within historically charged contexts. Housed in a residential building of significant urban and cultural value—officially recognized as a heritage monument—the project engages in a careful dialogue between past and present.</p>",

<h4>How systems become risky without anyone noticing.</h4><figure><img alt=""A Painting of Alexander Cutting the Gordian Knot"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*urJTxEUxB1exhlGRMTz9tg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Alexander Undoing the Gordian | Source: Knot 1st-art-gallery.com</figcaption></figure><p>No one decides to build a fragile system. No executive convenes a meeting to discuss how best to make operations inscrutable, unreliable, brittle. No engineer sets out to create software that no one can maintain or discern later on. No organization deliberately designs processes so convoluted that they guarantee failure.</p><p>Yet fragile, incomprehensible, unmaintainable, and failure-prone systems are everywhere. They are the norm. Systems that excel and are resilient are exceptional. So how come? Fragile systems didn’t arrive through dramatic decisions or catastrophic errors. They evolved. Their fragility and brittleness were accumulated gradually, through a thousand small, locally rational choices that collectively created something unmanageable. Therein lies the importance of Systems Thinking. To understand the aggregate dynamics of individual choices.</p><p><a href=""https://openlearning.mit.edu/news/ask-mit-professor-what-system-thinking-and-why-it-important"">Systems Thinking </a>is the best defense we have against the complexity run amuck. Complexity is an emergent property of systems. It evolves not from reckless decision-making but from responding sensibly to immediate, localized needs. A new feature here, a workaround there, an exception to handle an edge case, a patch to fix an urgent problem. Each addition seems small. Each solves a real problem. Each is approved and implemented with good intentions.</p><p>But complexity isn’t an additive attribute. It multiplies.</p><figure><img alt=""A diagram that demonstrates that the complexity of a system (connections) grows exponentially with the number of components in a system"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/776/0*2MfYpvTLBmGK5aYk.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Source: Author</figcaption></figure><p>Take the image above. In the abstract it does a good job of demonstrating complexity. A system of 3 nodes has just 3 unique connections. A system with 1 more node, doubles the number of connections to 6. Double that system and the number of connections grows exponentially. Somewhere along the way the system crosses a threshold where the system becomes so fraught with complexity that it creates genuine risk. Like the emergence of complexity, the probability also increases exponentially.</p><p><strong>How Complexity Accumulates</strong></p><p>The first step in managing complexity is understanding how it sneaks into systems despite everyone’s best efforts to keep things simple.</p><p>Feature Creep</p><p>Every user wants one more feature. Every stakeholder has a use case that isn’t quite covered. Every competitive analysis reveals something rivals offer that you don’t. The pressure to add is constant and multifaceted.</p><p>Individual feature requests seem reasonable. A customer needs the system to handle a specific edge case. A sales prospect will sign if you just add this one capability. An internal team needs special handling for their workflow.</p><p>Saying yes to each request improves the system for someone. But each addition increases the surface area of the system, manifesting in more code to maintain, more interactions to test, more documentation to write, more training to conduct, as well as an expanded Optimal Design Domain. The complexity grows with the factorial of features.</p><p>Procedural Layering</p><p>Organizations respond to problems <a href=""https://irb.northwestern.edu/compliance-education/corrective-and-preventive-action-capa-plans.html"">by adding procedures</a>. A mistake occurs; a new approval process is implemented. An audit finds gaps; a new compliance check is required. A risk materializes; a new control is instituted.</p><p>Each procedure makes sense in isolation. We should approve major purchases. We should verify compliance. We should control risk. But procedures accumulate faster than they’re removed. Organizations rarely ask, “What procedure can we eliminate now that we’re adding this one?”</p><p>The result is sedimentary layers of process, each representing a response to some past problem, many now obsolete but all still in force because no one has authority or incentive to remove them.</p><p><a href=""https://www.tocinstitute.org/theory-of-constraints.html"">The Theory of Constraints</a> (ToC) identifies this as policy constraints — rules and procedures that become bottlenecks themselves. <a href=""https://www.tocinstitute.org/eliyahu-goldratt.html"">Goldratt </a>(the creator of ToC) observed that organizations often implement policies to optimize local efficiency but never revisit them when conditions change, creating system-level dysfunction.</p><p>Informal Complexity, Work Arounds</p><p>When formal systems don’t serve user needs well, people create workarounds. They copy data manually between systems. They use spreadsheets to track what the official system should track but doesn’t. They develop informal communication channels because formal ones are too slow.</p><p>In my experience as an engineer, systems designer, and consultant, this is actually the norm of how business gets done. People are very entrepreneurial by nature. There’s never a formalized meeting to figure out how business operations ought to be completed, they just figure out what works, and that becomes the best practice. This is great for getting things done, but it also means that there is usually lots of low-hanging fruit to optimize these systems, usually at low cost.</p><p>Workarounds are innovations at the edges. They represent localized problem-solving that keeps work flowing. But they’re also a key driver of hidden complexity. The formal system looks simple on paper, but the actual operating system includes dozens of undocumented workarounds that only certain people know about.</p><p>When those people leave, their workarounds break. When systems change, workarounds that depended on specific quirks stop working. When new people join, they don’t know the workarounds exist and make errors because the formal system doesn’t match operational reality.</p><p>Technical Debt and The Infrastructure Accumulation</p><p>In software, technical debt is explicit and easy to detect. Shortcuts are taken to complete a project faster, leaving behind code that should be refactored later. Often, “later” never comes, and the debt accumulates.</p><p>But technical debt exists in all systems, not just software. In manufacturing, we regularly see equipment that’s been patched repeatedly, or modules added onto instead of replaced. In organizational design we even see it in the form of reporting lines being added without rethinking the fundamental design. It’s the sales training program that’s been updated piecemeal for every new product instead of redesigned.</p><p>Each piece of debt makes future changes harder. The code becomes harder to modify, because the internal logic is already fractal. The manufacturing equipment becomes more fragile. The organization becomes more difficult to reorganize. The training becomes less effective. The system becomes rigid precisely when it needs to be adaptive.</p><p><strong>Complexity Increases Faster Than Our Ability to Understand It</strong></p><p>A system’s complexity doesn’t scale linearly with system size. A system twice as large isn’t twice as complex. It’s often four times, eight times, or exponentially more complex.</p><p>Interaction Effects</p><p>An interaction is the reciprocal cause-and-effect relationship between two components within a system. This is important to understand how systems behave as a whole. Systems are not merely the sum of their parts. It means that as systems grow their complexity is boosted by the mutual and cyclical relationships., highlighting that influences are mutual and cyclical, not linear. A system with 10 components has 45 potential interaction pairs, but a system with 100 components has 4,950.</p><p>Most interactions don’t matter most of the time. But under stress, under unusual conditions, or when specific combinations occur, obscure interactions become critical. And the more interactions exist, the more likely that some will create failure modes no one anticipated. This is the principle of <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/bad-design-is-like-a-virus-design-defects-and-latent-failures-1e0ab4be7e52"">resident pathogens</a>.</p><p>You cannot understand a system by understanding its parts in isolation. The interactions between parts often dominate behavior. As those interactions multiply, understanding the whole becomes exponentially harder.</p><p>Emergent Behaviors</p><p>Complex systems exhibit emergent behaviors. Emergent behaviors are system-level properties that don’t exist in any individual component. Traffic jams emerge from individual driver decisions. Market crashes emerge from individual trading behaviors. Organizational dysfunction emerges from individual departmental optimizations. Flocking patterns of birds and Schools of Fish emerge as a result of many constituents which don’t, in and of themselves, possess these emergent properties.</p><figure><img alt=""A flock of birds during a yellow sunset"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*wIMNA47WVg3BzCiR.jpg"" /><figcaption>A Flock of birds as emergent behavior found in nature | Source: Arstechnica.com</figcaption></figure><p>Often spawned by localized decision making, these emergent properties are often negative (at least from the system designer’s perspective), namely because they are unintended and unexpected consequences. And they’re nearly impossible to predict because they emerge from the interaction of many factors, not from any single cause.</p><p><em>A side note/rant:</em></p><p><em>This is why I’m bearish when it comes to the future of gene editing technology. Gene editing methods like </em><a href=""https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2024/06/stanford-explainer-crispr-gene-editing-and-beyond""><em>CRISPR </em></a><em>uses correlations and probability to edit genes for some desired effect, eye color. But (1) these may correlate with other factors not accounted for (</em><a href=""https://www.the-scientist.com/how-are-earwax-and-body-odor-linked-72476""><em>like the relationship between earwax and body odor</em></a><em>) and (2) the collective editing of multiple genes can have greater unintended [read: emergent] consequences.</em></p><p>Cognitive Limits</p><p>Human working memory can hold roughly seven chunks of information. When a system has hundreds or thousands of interacting components, no individual can hold the complete system in their head. Understanding becomes distributed across many people, each of whom has a partial view.</p><p>This fragmentation of understanding is itself a risk. No one sees the whole. Decisions are made based on local knowledge that doesn’t account for global effects. Changes are implemented without understanding full implications. The system becomes too complex for anyone to fully reason about.</p><p><strong>Real-World Complexity Failures</strong></p><p>Healthcare.gov Launch (2013)</p><p>The Affordable Care Act’s federal insurance exchange launched in October 2013 and immediately collapsed. The website couldn’t handle traffic. Applications failed. Users couldn’t complete enrollment.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*bbTMPytERu-EIAQH.png"" /><figcaption>The now famous error screen of HealthCare.gov | Source: Medium.com</figcaption></figure><p>The failure wasn’t a single bug or bad decision. It was systemic complexity. Multiple contractors built different pieces. Systems needed to integrate with existing federal databases. State exchanges needed to interface with the federal system. Security requirements added layers.

Orders from the mixed system created erratic behavior that cost $440 million in 45 minutes.</p><p>The complexity wasn’t in the trading logic itself but was in the deployment process, version control, and fail-safes (or lack thereof). Each element seemed manageable. But the interaction of partial deployment, legacy code, and automated trading created a failure mode that destroyed the company.</p><p>Boeing 787 Development Delays</p><p><a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/24/business/boeing-787-dreamliner-halt"">Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner was years late </a>and billions over budget, largely due to complexity in managing a global supply chain with unprecedented outsourcing.

It was organizational and logistical. Coordinating work across dozens of companies, ensuring interface compatibility, managing schedule dependencies, and integrating testing added complexity that multiplied with every additional partner and interface.</p><p><strong>Detecting Accumulated Complexity</strong></p><p>Complexity accumulates invisibly until it causes problems. How do you detect it before it becomes critical?</p><p>Warning Signs:</p><ol><li><strong>Lengthening cycle times</strong>: Changes that used to take days now take weeks. This often signals that complexity has increased friction.</li><li><strong>Rising error rates</strong>: More defects, more support tickets, more exceptions. Complexity creates more failure modes.</li><li><strong>Knowledge silos</strong>: Only certain people can work on certain systems because they’re too complex for newcomers to learn quickly.</li><li><strong>Fear of change</strong>: Teams resist modifications because they’re not confident about side effects. “If it’s working, don’t touch it” becomes the mantra.</li><li><strong>Escalating maintenance costs</strong>: More time spent fixing and patching, less time spent building new capability.</li><li><strong>Integration problems</strong>: New features break existing functionality in unexpected ways.</li><li><strong>Documentation drift</strong>: Formal documentation no longer matches actual operation because the system has evolved through undocumented changes.</li></ol><p>These symptoms don’t prove complexity directly, but they correlate strongly with systems that have accumulated too much of it.</p><p>Quantitative Measures:</p><p>For software systems, metrics like <a href=""https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/cyclomatic-complexity/"">cyclomatic complexity</a>, coupling metrics, and dependency graphs provide numerical complexity measures and diagnostic tools. But even non-software systems can be measured:</p><ul><li><strong>Decision tree depth</strong>: How many conditional branches exist in a process?</li><li><strong>Role count</strong>: How many different roles touch a workflow?</li><li><strong>Approval layers</strong>: How many sign-offs does a decision require?</li><li><strong>Exception frequency</strong>: How often do standard processes require exceptions?</li><li><strong>Handoff count</strong>: How many times does work transfer between people or systems?</li></ul><p>High values don’t automatically mean there’s a problem. Complexity is sometimes necessary. But they indicate where to look for opportunities to simplify and where to triage when something breaks.</p><p><strong>Pruning Unnecessary Complexity</strong></p><p>Once you’ve detected complexity, how do you reduce it without breaking things that work?</p><p>1. Dependency Mapping</p><p>You can’t simplify what you don’t understand. Create visual maps of dependencies:</p><ul><li>What depends on what?</li><li>What components interact?</li><li>What can be changed independently?</li><li>Where are the tight couplings?</li></ul><figure><img alt=""An example of a dependency map"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZidzvGzhvpLFVASu2l9qtQ.png"" /><figcaption>An example of a dependency map | Source: dependency-map.com</figcaption></figure><p>Tools exist for software (dependency analyzers, architecture visualization). For organizational systems, this might be process maps, responsibility matrices (RACI), or workflow diagrams.</p><p>2. The 80/20 Analysis</p><p>Most systems exhibit <a href=""https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/pareto-distribution"">Pareto distributions</a>: 20% of features deliver 80% of value, 20% of code contains 80% of bugs, 20% of procedures handle 80% of cases.</p><figure><img alt=""An Example of a Pareto Distribution"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*hKMuHOxk7ZxHLk1Z"" /><figcaption>An Example of a Pareto Distribution | Source: scirp.org</figcaption></figure><p>Identify:</p><ul><li>Which features are rarely used?</li><li>Which procedures handle edge cases?</li><li>Which code paths are seldom executed?</li></ul><p>These low-value, high-maintenance components are prime candidates for elimination. Removing them reduces surface area without significantly reducing capability.</p><p><a href=""https://www.lightsondata.com/why-focus-reduce-variation/"">Deming’s focus on variation reduction</a> is relevant here. Simplification reduces sources of variation, making systems more stable and predictable. Eliminating rarely-used features eliminates rare but costly failure modes.</p><p>3. Complexity Budgets</p><p>Treat complexity as a constrained resource, like memory or budget. Every addition must fit within the budget, which means something else might need to be removed.</p><p>This forces explicit trade-offs: “To add this feature, we need to remove three existing ones. Which should go?” The question surfaces costs that are otherwise hidden.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/@ankitsingh1583/how-netflix-uber-and-amazon-manage-their-microservices-at-scale-97b028da2134"">Netflix famously has a policy limiting microservices complexity</a>: teams can add new services, but the total count must stay within bounds, forcing consolidation and simplification as a regular practice.</p><p>4. Simplification Audits</p><p>Regularly review systems specifically to identify simplification opportunities:</p><ul><li>Which procedures exist because of problems that no longer occur?</li><li>Which features could be consolidated?</li><li>Which integrations could be eliminated?</li><li>Which exceptions could be standardized?</li></ul><p>The <a href=""https://www.tocinstitute.org/theory-of-constraints.html"">Theory of Constraints</a> teaches to focus improvement efforts on constraints. But TOC also recognizes that non-constraint resources shouldn’t be optimized to full capacity. Similarly, not every part of a system needs maximum capability. Some parts can and should be simplified, even if it means slightly reduced local performance, if it improves overall system manageability.</p><p>5. Modular Decomposition</p><p>Break complex systems into loosely <a href=""https://aisel.aisnet.org/ecis2022_rp/52/"">coupled modules </a>with clear interfaces. This doesn’t reduce total complexity, but it contains and partitions it.</p><p>A monolithic system with 1,000 interconnected parts is unmanageable. Ten modules of 100 parts each, with well-defined interfaces between modules, is manageable. You can understand one module deeply without needing to understand all modules.</p><p>This requires discipline in interface design: modules should interact through narrow, well-specified interfaces, not through deep coupling or shared state. When modularity is maintained, complexity within modules stays local and doesn’t ripple system-wide.</p><p>6. Standardization and Platforming</p><p>Reduce variety by standardizing components and building on common platforms. Instead of five different authentication systems, use one. Instead of three different data formats, standardize on one.</p><p>This trades flexibility for simplicity. You can’t optimize each use case perfectly, but you reduce the number of things that need to be understood, maintained, and integrated.</p><p><a href=""https://www.6sigma.us/business-process-management-articles/process-standardization-for-operational-excellence/"">Standardization of processes is foundational for quality</a>. You can’t improve what varies wildly. You can’t maintain what’s different everywhere. Standardization creates the baseline from which to build, measure, and improve.</p><p><strong>Culture and Resisting Complexity</strong></p><p>Technical approaches help, but the deeper challenge is cultural. Organizations must develop a <a href=""https://www.pmi.org/disciplined-agile/dealing-with-complexity-by-creating-a-bias-for-simplicity"">bias toward simplicity</a>, which cuts against many incentives.</p><p>Incentive Misalignments:</p><ul><li>Product managers are rewarded for feature additions, not feature removals</li><li>Engineers are evaluated on what they build, not what they eliminate</li><li>Processes are added in response to visible problems; removing them is invisible work</li><li>Budgets reward spending, not simplification</li></ul><p>To counter these, organizations need to:</p><ul><li><strong>Celebrate simplification</strong>: Publicize cases where removing features improved the product</li><li><strong>Measure complexity explicitly</strong>: Track metrics like code complexity, process steps, and approval layers</li><li><strong>Require simplification alongside addition</strong>: New features must be accompanied by the removal of old features</li><li><strong>Create dedicated simplification initiatives</strong>: Not as ongoing work but as explicit projects with resources</li></ul><p>The Power of “No”</p><p>The most important complexity control is saying no to additions. This is politically difficult — every addition has a constituency. But the cumulative cost of saying yes too often is a system that collapses under its own weight.</p><p>Saying no requires:</p><ul><li>Clear criteria for what’s in scope and what’s not</li><li>Explicit recognition that the capacity for complexity is limited</li><li>Willingness to disappoint stakeholders in the service of system sustainability</li><li>Authority structures that can enforce boundaries</li></ul><p><a href=""https://www.uwyo.edu/ceps/development/awards/deming.html"">W. Edwards Deming</a>’s point about <a href=""https://deming.org/create-constancy-of-purpose/"">constancy of purpose</a> applies here. Without a consistent commitment to simplicity, complexity accumulates as each decision optimizes locally without considering global effects.</p><p><strong>Living with Necessary Complexity</strong></p><p>Some complexity is essential. Real-world problems are complex; solutions must match that complexity to some degree. The eliminate unnecessary complexity while managing necessary complexity effectively.</p><p><strong>Essential Complexity:</strong></p><ul><li>Business rules that reflect genuine domain complexity</li><li>Integration points that correspond to real organizational boundaries</li><li>Features that deliver significant value to significant user populations</li><li>Redundancy that provides resilience</li></ul><p>This complexity should be:</p><ul><li>Explicit: Documented and understood</li><li>Contained: Modularized so it doesn’t leak</li><li>Justified: Regularly validated as still necessary</li></ul><p><strong>Accidental Complexity:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=""https://idenhaus.com/why-workarounds-are-iams-silent-killer/"">Workarounds</a> for systems that should be fixed</li><li>Procedures created in response to one-time events</li><li>Features that sounded good but are rarely used</li><li>Integration patterns that evolved organically without design</li></ul><p>This complexity should be systematically hunted and eliminated.</p><p>The distinction isn’t always clear, but the question should be constantly asked: is this complexity necessary, or did it just accumulate?</p><p><strong>Conclusion: Complexity as Systemic Debt</strong></p><p>Complexity is like financial debt: sometimes useful, always carrying a cost, and dangerous when it accumulates beyond your ability to service it.</p><p>Taking on debt to invest in growth can be smart. But debt that accumulates from routine operations without producing value is insidious. It constrains future options, increases risk, and eventually demands painful restructuring.</p><p>The same is true of complexity. Some complexity enables capability. But much of how complexity propagates is just accumulation, the residue of past decisions that no one has cleaned up. It makes the system fragile, expensive to maintain, and difficult to evolve.</p><p>The challenge is that complexity accumulates gradually and locally while its costs manifest globally and suddenly. Each small addition seems manageable. The cumulative effect is system failure that seems to come from nowhere but was actually built up over years of accretion.</p><p>Managing this requires:</p><ul><li><strong>Vigilance</strong>: Constantly watching for complexity creep</li><li><strong>Discipline</strong>: Resisting additions and forcing eliminations</li><li><strong>Understanding</strong>: Mapping and measuring complexity</li><li><strong>Investment</strong>: Dedicating resources to simplification</li><li><strong>Culture</strong>: Valuing simplicity as much as capability</li></ul><p>Systems should be designed for improvement, not just for operation. This means building systems that can be understood, modified, and simplified. Systems that resist simplification, where every change risks breaking something else, have accumulated too much complexity. I also mentioned this as a key principle to designing <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/responsible-tech-principles-for-technological-use-and-development-3de9f6d8f49d"">Responsible and Humane Technology</a>.</p><p>The risk isn’t that your system will fail catastrophically tomorrow. It’s that complexity accumulates silently until one day you discover your system has become so fragile, so opaque, and so expensive to maintain that it’s effectively unmaintainable. By then, you have few options: live with mounting failures or undertake expensive, risky restructuring.</p><p>The solution is prevention: treat complexity as debt, recognize when you’re taking it on, ensure it’s justified, and regularly pay it down. Build systems that can be simplified, not just systems that work. Create cultures that celebrate subtraction as much as addition.</p><blockquote>“Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away” — <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1020792.Antoine_de_Saint_Exup_ry"">Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</a></blockquote><p>Because in the long run, the systems that survive aren’t the ones with the most features, the most procedures, or the most components. They’re the ones that remain understandable, maintainable, and adaptable. They are the ones that resisted the inexorable accumulation of unnecessary complexity.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e222182a67f5"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-complexity-accumulates-e222182a67f5"">How complexity accumulates</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Yes, they’re powerful. Yes, they let us do more. But there’s this weird disconnect growing between me and the things I make. When everything is instant, it starts feeling like a slot machine. Except you always win. Which makes it more addictive. And somehow… also boring?</p><p>And you can’t stop. Social media keeps telling us to ship more, faster, be first. But when anyone has the power of a team of 10x engineers (lol), being first isn’t even a moat anymore. It’s just being slightly less late.</p><p>The worst part is what this comic is about. I catch myself using AI for things I used to enjoy doing. Changing a font size. Adjusting the border radius. Pushing pixels until the result made me proud.</p><p>I still do something similar, but now it’s a conversation. I tell the spirit in the terminal to do it for me. “Make the left padding a bit wider. Make the animation snappier. Use our subtle foreground color… don’t use any color, use our color token. Oh, and make it smaller, go from sm to xs.” That’s my new <em>pixel-pushing.</em></p><p>Why? Because I can. And that’s the trap.</p><p>The thing gets done but it doesn’t feel like I did anything. I could’ve written that code myself… but sometimes I don’t even know where the component lives in the files. I’d have to inspect the element in the browser, find the classes, copy them, search them in my IDE, locate the file, then edit it (am I the only one who does this?) So instead… I just talk to the machine. I overexplain so it only changes what I want. I don’t design anymore. I direct.</p><p>But these things could direct themselves too. The “human in the loop” feels less like the guide and more like the thing slowing it all down. Some people call this slowing of the machine… this fine-tuning… “taste.” The ultimate human moat. Guys, stop it with your “taste.” I’ve seen how you dress. You don’t have any. And taste is really just doing things the way the top 10% of creators do instead of the average. That’s a pattern. Patterns are exactly what these things are built to learn… just give it time (a month?).</p><p>But hey… this comic? I tried new angles, more creative shots. All hand-drawn. No model. No worktree. No extra-high reasoning. Just me and the canvas. And that feels good. Like… “look, mom, I made this!”</p><p>Look, I’m in a rut. I really love these tools, I love creating with AI, I’ve never felt so productive. They’re wild and they’re powerful. But I hope we keep the joy.

<h4>Designers should be thriving in the age of AI. Here’s why we aren’t, why it’s probably our fault, and how we can fix it.</h4><figure><img alt=""The Beatles on red pointy hats with sunflowers"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wXwxelMpQ2KNjnTN1Tzm-w.png"" /><figcaption>The Beatles, Magical Mystery Tour (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/de/title/tt0061937/mediaviewer/rm3997504000/"">source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Much has been said about the future of design in the age of AI. Some think the role will disappear completely. Others say only super-seniors will survive. And yet others say it’s all just a blip in time and there will be no fundamental change.</p><p>I think all are wrong.</p><p>For two reasons:</p><ol><li>Designers are naturally attuned to adapt to technological change. We are trained to identify and acknowledge change, manage adaptation, and find solutions for friction.</li><li>We’re moving towards a totally new definition of digital products. Away from interfaces, and towards fluid use cases that we’re only beginning to imagine now. To make this accessible and valuable to all, we will need designers at all levels. <em>Obviously</em>.</li></ol><p>Why, then, has the design community been in absolute panic since AI has been taking off?</p><p>Seniors are telling juniors to count themselves lucky if they’ll ever find a job.</p><p>Design leaders are jumping from one AI-tool hypetrain to the next in mere weeks.</p><p>Monday, it’s all about prototypes. Thursday, it’s vibe coding. Friday, we’re preaching that output no longer matters (everyone can design now!) and that we should be brilliant strategists instead. By next Monday, we’ll be half-heartedly debating which soft skills are absolutely vital to survive.</p><p><em>Survive.</em> As designers.</p><p>As if our skills have evaporated overnight, and we can only stick around if we somehow show that we’re good for (undefined) other stuff.</p><p>No.</p><p>We should be thriving.</p><p>Where has it all gone wrong? Why aren’t designers winning in the age of AI, which, at its core, is about <em>making</em>?</p><p>The thing we do best.</p><p>Here’s what I think.</p><h4>We’ve been sabotaging ourselves.</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7ogC1IGrkuO2HuDnFDBoKA.png"" /><figcaption>The Beatles, Magical Mystery Tour (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/de/title/tt0061937/mediaviewer/rm1950683648/"">source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Please don’t be enraged. Take a deep breath and think about it.</p><p>Ever since the first AI tools with strong visual output started emerging, we seemingly overnight started screaming from all rooftops about:</p><p><strong><em>taste</em></strong>.</p><h4>What the fck is taste?</h4><p><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/taste-vs-technical-skills-ai/"">According to NNG</a> it’s “the learned, subjective ability to discern and select the most effective, harmonious, and high-quality elements for a project”.</p><p>Maybe, if you’re really smart, you can picture what that means. But really, if you’re honest, taste is a vague concept. Taste is subjective. Taste is not something that makes a product win (for the most part).</p><p>And vague is not <em>good</em> — especially not in a time of transformation where no one really knows where we’re going yet. Where tech stacks are changing weekly, and user needs are developing at rocket speed.</p><p>You know what else <em>vague</em> is bad for? Convincing an executive to invest in something.</p><p>It generally takes three things to grab an executive's attention.</p><ol><li>Connection (Do you get their problem?).</li><li>Authority (Do you know your stuff?).</li><li>Vision (Do you know where this is going?).</li></ol><p>Taste doesn’t answer any of those. You know what else doesn’t?</p><h4>Shitty prototypes.</h4><p>Yeah, I’ve made my fair share of them, too. But the time when these impressed anyone is over. Even my 0% designer husband can now vibe code stuff and knows how to whip up a design prototype.</p><p>There is a time and place for them. Prototypes and vibe-coded projects are great to show a vision, build excitement, or unblock a team that’s stuck in process. But they’re not what’s gonna convince your engineering stakeholders to give you access to their codebase so you can actually start shipping fixes from your design backlog.</p><p>I’d like to argue that excessive prototyping is the next big issue that’s messing with the status of design in the age of AI.</p><p>Because they undermine our authority. There’s the executive’s next red flag. <em>Do you know your stuff?</em></p><p>Of course, designers recognised this concern quickly. How did we respond?</p><p>By starting never-ending discussions about:</p><p><strong><em>craft</em>.</strong></p><h4>What the heck is craft?</h4><p>I like <a href=""https://www.nsead.org/resources/teaching-inspiration/craft/defining-craft/"">this definition</a>: “Craft can be defined as intelligent making. It is technically, materially and culturally informed. Craft is the designing and making of individual artefacts and objects, encouraging the development of intellectual, creative and practical skills, visual sensitivity and a working knowledge of tools, materials and systems”.</p><p>Welp.</p><p><em>Taste and craft walk into a bar…</em></p><p>Just kidding.</p><p>You get my point. Here is another vague concept that most people associate with activities they liked to do back in kindergarten.</p><p>And listen, I’m not knocking craft. I love writing poetry, painting, throwing pots at the wheel. All that takes craft and skill, just as my designs at work do. But craft should be so obvious to us as designers that we should not make it our <em>main</em> selling point.</p><p>Obviously, we develop incredible craft as our experience builds. Obviously, individual designers have different styles. Obviously, we put thought and care into what we make.</p><p>Craft is the baseline. That’s what we want the executives to know. By debating it and what it even means, we’re again undermining our authority. And I’d argue we’re also not really connecting with them OR showing much vision.</p><p>Well, shit.</p><p><strong>How do we get out of this mess?</strong></p><p>We need to remember — and remind others — why design is irreplaceable.</p><h4>We’re the OG makers.</h4><p>We’re “growth mindset”, personified.</p><p>In most classic product companies, there are <a href=""https://www.producttalk.org/glossary-discovery-product-trio/"">trios</a>: A product manager, a designer, and an engineer. The point? To ensure that the perspectives of the users and the business are balanced with the technical capabilities throughout the development process.</p><p>While a well-functioning trio feels like a cheat code to achieving product velocity, an unbalanced one can slow things down, ship mediocre stuff, or not at all.</p><p>The best trios I’ve worked in and observed had one very obvious trait in common: we all respected each other's practice, but we also understood enough about each other’s domains to be unafraid to push back.</p><p>Only a designer who understands the business side of things can really translate business goals into conversion flows.</p><p>Only a product manager who understands the fundamentals of good design can push a designer to level up.</p><p>And only an engineer who cares for users and understands how the business works is an equal partner in a trio.</p><p>And while AI is bringing all of our roles closer together, we are still the builders of <em>the experience</em>.</p><p>The thing that is actually being used. The thing executives aim to deliver.</p><ol><li><strong>Connection</strong>: You want to make something. We can tell you if it’s possible. If yes, we can ensure it’s made in the best possible way.</li><li><strong>Authority</strong>: We work at the intersection of what the business wants, the user needs, and what actually works.</li><li><strong>Vision</strong>: We have the skills, tools, and mindset to create something you <em>can’t even/can only</em> imagine.</li></ol><p>Sold.</p><h4>The design mindset is unique.</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iI-tGWT87XJnnLmo7XwFKA.png"" /><figcaption>The Beatles, Magical Mystery Tour (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/de/title/tt0061937/mediaviewer/rm725418752/"">source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>And it’s beautiful.</p><p><strong>It’s human-centred. </strong>Deep empathy for the user is the foundation, ensuring solutions address real needs, feelings, and motivations.</p><p><strong>It embraces ambiguity.</strong> Viewing problems as opportunities rather than roadblocks.</p><p><strong>It kills its darlings by default and favours learning.</strong> A willingness to “fail fast,” learn from prototypes, and constantly adapt solutions based on feedback.</p><p><strong>It’s, at its core, optimistic and inclusive.</strong> Bringing diverse perspectives together, believing that better solutions can always be created.</p><p><strong>It’s the most curious of mindsets.</strong> Asking “why” and “what if” to challenge the status quo at every turn.</p><p>You don’t have to read this twice to know: hell yes, we need designers with AI taking over more and more space in our lives.</p><h4>Here’s what we need to do. Now.</h4><p>In most classic design teams, there are different roles: Product designers, content designers, user researchers, sometimes motion designers, and ops people. Their educational background is essentially the same: developing an understanding of users, business, and products. Some focus more on the look and feel, others on going in depth on the “how it works”.</p><p><strong>So, for the love of everything good, can we please stop debating our titles?</strong></p><h4>We are all designers.</h4><p>Designers make stuff. Some use words and taxonomy, others use pixels. Some use language, others use code. The mindset is the same. The mindset is what matters.</p><p><strong>Yes, AI is muddying the lines between design roles. But it doesn’t matter.</strong></p><p>Not because it can replace people, but because it can save time that, in return, can be used to develop the skills traditionally only another role would need. Not so you can replace someone, but:</p><p><strong>So you can become a more holistic, better maker.</strong></p><p>This is not new.</p><p>There’s always been a push for all designers to do their own research. For content designers to develop visual skills. For product designers to get strong at prototyping. Now, finally, we can do so — with far less effort than before.</p><p>That doesn’t mean we should think less. It means we <em>can</em> think more.</p><p>I, personally, love thinking. Nothing gets me as high as solving a problem. It’s the reason I got into design, and specifically design in tech, in the first place. There were actual (cool) problems to solve.</p><p>I originally picked UX content as my toolkit. Now, my toolkit has expanded. I love that. And I don’t want to waste time wondering what my title should be, whether my taste is good enough, or what <em>exactly</em> my craft is now.</p><p>I want to make stuff.</p><p>And I think you do, too.</p><p>Nicole is a Content Designer turned Design Director based in Stockholm, Sweden.

<h4>The shallowness of the “empathy machine.”</h4><figure><img alt=""a guy using VR headset in a fancy living room"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*5waTlYqbHeJwFdxz"" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=""https://unsplash.com/@silverkblack?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Vitaly Gariev</a> on <a href=""https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>I once saw a “poverty simulation” designed to help raise funds and “put people in others’ shoes.” I felt… weird. Can you imagine someone going through a 10-minute fancy VR experience and suddenly claiming they understand the struggles?</p><p>VR allows users to step into any experience from a first-person perspective. Some people call it an “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXHil1TPxvA\"">empathy machine</a>” and argue that it could influence decision-makers. I bought into it at first. However, after going through several simulations, I noticed that no matter how moved I was in the moment, none of it led to any real behavioral change.</p><p>Is it just me? Or is this “trigger empathy and cause behavioral change” design goal too impractical and overhyped?</p><h3>Why do people believe that VR can trigger empathy?</h3><p>VR allows users to inhabit avatars, and their brains might start believing that the virtual body is theirs (<a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.814565/full"">researchers</a> call this “sense of embodiment”). Some designers believe this can <strong>encourage perspective-taking, reduce implicit bias, and eventually induce empathy.</strong></p><p>In theory, it makes sense. But in reality, this assumption is too ideal and shallow. First, your brain isn’t that easy to trick. A tiny glitch — a slight delay between movement and render, or weird skin texture — will remind you it’s fake. More importantly, embodiment alone is just a shallow representation of identity. For example, putting users in a Black body doesn’t give them hundreds of years of history or lived experience. It doesn’t make them part of the Black community, and it certainly won’t create sustainable empathy.</p><h3>What is empathy, exactly?</h3><p>This word seems a bit abstract, so let’s define it better here. When <a href=""https://tmb.apaopen.org/pub/vr-improves-emotional-empathy-only/release/2"">researchers </a>and designers discuss empathy, they’re usually talking about two different kinds: <strong>emotional </strong>and <strong>cognitive</strong>.</p><p>Emotional empathy is immediate and direct, like seeing someone in pain makes you feel discomfort too. Cognitive empathy goes deeper. It’s when you actively try to understand someone’s mental state and decision-making process, and this kind of empathy is what usually leads to behavioral change.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AiXVB-J8JEHS2BtKZ3n9VA.png"" /></figure><p>VR is pretty good at triggering emotional empathy because it provides users with intense sensory information. But the reaction doesn’t last. For me, it usually starts fading about 10 minutes after removing the headset. I think the problem is that while I’m in the experience, I’m so overwhelmed by everything I’m sensing that I can’t actually think about what the character is going through mentally.<strong> Without that deeper engagement, cognitive empathy never gets triggered.</strong></p><h3><strong>VR’s shallow content</strong></h3><p>Beyond sensory overload, VR simulations lack the depth needed for cognitive empathy.</p><p>The content is often shallow. Let’s compare it with other storytelling media: movies and books are usually built on years of research and interviews, while VR simulations prioritize technical execution, focusing on realistic graphics and interactions over storytelling depth. <strong>Users often end up distracted by the novelty of technology instead of engaging with the issues.</strong></p><p>Time is another constraint. Most VR simulations run under 10 minutes, which isn’t enough to convey background or context. Understanding social issues often requires hours of learning and engagement just to grasp the basics. However, creating longer experiences isn’t practical either because VR headsets are bulky and uncomfortable, and the sensory intensity creates fatigue quickly.</p><h3><strong>When VR simulation might work</strong></h3><p>VR probably isn’t the best tool for creating sustainable empathy or long-term behavioral change. However, it can still be effective when applied with clear, specific design goals instead of vague “triggering empathy” objectives.</p><p>Take healthcare training for example. <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6148621/"">Research </a>shows that medical students better understand conditions like Alzheimer’s through VR, improving their compassionate care. It works because <strong>VR complements their existing education.</strong> These students already study these topics extensively through patient shadowing, workshops, and reflective practice.</p><p>Unlike general audiences with no background, these students approach VR with clear learning objectives. They know they’re not trying to “feel like” elderly patients but learning to recognize specific physical symptoms. They’re less likely to get distracted by the technology and can navigate the experience better. The actual empathy develops later, when they interact with real patients.</p><p>No one can really “walk in others’ shoes.” Empathy is a complex emotion. Social issues are far more complicated than any simulation can capture, and technology only scratches the surface: loud explosions simulate sound, not fear. Disorientation replicates physical sensations, not the psychological toll of experiencing it every day.</p><p>New technology isn’t always the shortcut to the solution. Real perspective-taking requires a more time-consuming traditional approach: engaging with communities, reading, and listening. As a developer, I try to remember these limitations instead of chasing technology hype with vague, overambitious goals.</p><h3>Reference:</h3><ol><li>Milk, C. [TED]. (2015).

It arose from its premise, namely that individuals can be enrolled into a neighbourhood-scale, real-time AI <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/tech/876866/ring-search-party-super-bowl-ad-online-backlash"">surveillance network</a> without ever explicitly consenting to participate.</p><p>Within days, Ring terminated its planned partnership with <a href=""https://www.flocksafety.com/"">Flock Safety</a>, a company criticised for operating large-scale <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2026/02/17/nx-s1-5612825/flock-contracts-canceled-immigration-survillance-concerns"">automated licence plate recognition systems</a> used by <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/12/effs-investigations-expose-flock-safetys-surveillance-abuses-2025-review"">US law enforcement</a>. Ring cited <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy8dxz1g7zo"">implementation complexity</a>. The timing suggests a more candid explanation. The partnership made visible a widening gap between what surveillance technologies enable and what the public is prepared to tolerate.</p><p>This episode illustrates a defining feature of contemporary AI deployment. Individuals are no longer incorporated primarily as deliberate users; they are absorbed as ambient data contributors. Consent is not requested. It is inferred from physical presence. And when the implications of that inference become politically salient, withdrawal tends to be tactical rather than principled.</p><h3>When presence becomes participation</h3><p>Ring’s <em>Search Party</em> feature queries nearby cameras when a missing pet is reported. As <a href=""https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-demands-amazon-abandon-plan-to-include-facial-recognition-technology-in-ring-doorbells"">Senator Ed Markey observed</a>, this closely resembles neighbourhood-scale surveillance infrastructure. Crucially, <em>Search Party</em> does not operate in isolation. Ring’s <a href=""https://ring.com/support/articles/z3yhg/familiar-faces""><em>Familiar Faces</em></a> feature applies facial recognition to anyone passing within camera range, continuously scanning and categorising faces without their explicit knowledge or agreement.</p><figure><img alt=""Smartphone screen showing Ring’s Search Party interface asking a user to verify whether their camera footage matches a reported missing dog."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*RkS0GTIqXOE7qOGO.jpg"" /><figcaption>Ring’s Search Party interface prompts users to verify footage from their cameras, illustrating how neighbourhood-scale surveillance continues through everyday product features. <strong>Image source: </strong><a href=""https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/ring-search-party-for-dogs-united-states-missing-pets""><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong>.</strong></figcaption></figure><p>Combined, these capabilities enable tracking across residential space through distributed, privately owned sensors. The system no longer merely secures private property. It facilitates continuous monitoring of public movement.</p><p>The central tension lies in default inclusion. Neighbours are not asked whether their footage should be analysed for AI searches. Passers-by are not consulted before their biometric features are processed. Cameras function as environmental infrastructure, and physical presence alone becomes sufficient grounds for enrolment.</p><p><strong>This is not informed consent. It is participation assumed through exposure.</strong></p><p>Yuval Noah Harari captures this historical inversion precisely in <a href=""https://www.ynharari.com/book/nexus/""><em>Nexus</em></a>:</p><p><em>“In a world where humans monitored humans, privacy was the default.”</em></p><p>In sensor-saturated environments, <strong>the opposite is now true</strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""Cover images of Yuval Noah Harari’s book Nexus, titled “A Brief History of Information Networks from the Stone Age to AI”."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*iaX961XQIJtbLeHh.jpg"" /><figcaption>Cover of <em>Nexus</em> by Yuval Noah Harari, which examines the historical shift from human-to-human monitoring to large-scale information networks. <strong>Image source:</strong> <a href=""https://www.ynharari.com/book/nexus/"">Yuval Noah Harari, official website.</a></figcaption></figure><h3>The normalisation of suspicion</h3><p>The problem is not only technical but social. Platforms such as Ring’s <a href=""https://apps.apple.com/us/app/neighbors-by-ring/id1218902777""><em>Neighbours</em> app</a> have reformatted the neighbourhood watch into what critics describe as participatory mass surveillance. Real-time alerts about “suspicious activity” gamify vigilance, rewarding users who flag anomalies in their surroundings.</p><p>The consequences are not evenly distributed. Research consistently shows that people of colour are disproportionately labelled as suspicious on these platforms. What begins as a private perception becomes a data point: timestamped, geotagged, and <em>potentially</em> routed toward <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/16/amazon-ring-cameras-surveillance-law-enforcement-crime-police-investigations.html"">police response</a>. The technology does not create implicit bias, but it institutionalises it, converting individual prejudice into operational logic.</p><p>When private cameras become the mechanism by which those biases trigger formal intervention, the question of <strong>who gets watched, and who gets to watch</strong>, becomes a civil rights issue rather than a consumer preference.</p><h3>The Infrastructure of Inevitable Surveillance</h3><p>The abandoned Flock Safety partnership reveals how such systems scale institutionally. The proposed integration could have allowed police departments to <a href=""https://www.cnet.com/home/security/amazons-ring-cameras-push-deeper-into-police-and-government-surveillance/"">request Ring footage</a> through Flock’s platform, following a <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1080/01972243.2015.1107166"">familiar trajectory</a> in which consumer products evolve into mechanisms for data aggregation and institutional access.</p><p>This pipeline matters beyond the cancelled partnership. Where law enforcement lacks the legal grounds for neighbourhood-wide warrants, access to aggregated community camera data can serve a functionally equivalent role. Even when platforms restrict direct police access, data frequently travels through intermediaries whose business models involve selling location and behavioural data to government agencies operating well outside local democratic oversight.</p><p><strong>Cancelling one visible integration does not seal the pipeline. It merely reroutes it.</strong></p><p>Ring’s transformation from consumer hardware to data-centric platform makes this structural rather than accidental. When one person installs a camera, they consent on their own behalf. That camera nonetheless captures neighbours, delivery workers, and passers-by. As camera density increases, opting out becomes practically impossible, since avoidance requires withdrawal from shared space altogether. At that point, consent functions largely as theatre.</p><p>Harari notes that in 2023 more than <strong>one billion CCTV cameras</strong> were operative globally, roughly <strong>one for every eight people</strong>. Surveillance is no longer exceptional. <a href=""https://wifitalents.com/cctv-surveillance-industry-statistics/"">It is infrastructural.</a></p><h3>The security paradox</h3><p>There is also a pragmatic argument against centralised surveillance systems that receives less attention than it deserves: they are extraordinarily attractive targets for attack.</p><p>Aggregating millions of home cameras into a unified platform creates not only a privacy risk but a security one. A successful breach of a centralised AI hub would grant attackers what security researchers call <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/12/10/369740829/forget-creepy-nunbergs-word-of-the-year-is-bigger-and-two-god-view""><em>god-view</em> access</a>: real-time visibility into private residences across entire cities. Footage intended to protect households becomes the means by which those households are exposed.</p><p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/23/amazon-ring-camera-hack-lawsuit-threats"">Ring itself experienced security breaches in its early years</a>, including incidents in which attackers accessed cameras and harassed residents. Those were isolated failures. The risk posed by fully centralised systems, in which aggregation, AI analysis, and institutional access converge, is categorically larger.</p><p><a href=""https://kijero.com/blog/post/cctv-cameras-with-cloud-storage-vs-local-storage#:~:text=Privacy%20is%20one%20of%20the,data%20as%20you%20see%20fit."">Security researchers have long argued</a> that local storage, where footage remains within the home rather than uploaded to corporate servers, is the only architecture that eliminates this class of risk entirely. The dominance of cloud-based models reflects economic incentives tied to data extraction, not technical necessity.</p><h3>Beyond naive data optimism</h3><p>Harari describes the <em>naive view of information</em> as the belief that <a href=""https://medium.com/credtent-on-content/the-naive-view-of-engagement-why-more-isnt-better-c4b3227c7b6d"">more data naturally yields better outcomes</a>, while ignoring how power and incentives shape its use. Ring’s AI features exemplify this assumption. Expanded footage access and continuous biometric analysis are framed as unambiguous improvements to safety, while questions of agency, governance, and asymmetrical control receive minimal attention.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram showing information leading to truth, which then branches toward either wisdom or power."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OdHvYopGD6Fr5bADW_sRwg.png"" /><figcaption><strong>Diagram from <em>Nexus</em> by Yuval Noah Harari</strong> illustrating the naive assumption that more information naturally leads to truth and better outcomes, while in practice diverging toward either wisdom or power.</figcaption></figure><p>The proposed Flock integration made this logic explicit. Convenience justified infrastructure. Infrastructure produced data. Data became the substrate for AI analysis and policing. The progression reflects economic alignment rather than malicious intent, but the outcome is the same regardless.</p><h3>Making consent meaningful again</h3><p>The challenge is not whether AI should exist in sensor-rich environments. It is how legitimacy is established in spaces that are collectively experienced.</p><p>Three governance approaches already exist and could be implemented without delay.</p><p>First, <strong>default opt-in rather than opt-out</strong>. AI surveillance features should require active, informed activation. <a href=""https://medium.com/@www.manuelmiles/the-psychology-of-defaults-79d492bc99cc"">Behavioural research shows that most users never alter default settings.</a> Reversing this would not restrict the technology; it would make participation genuinely voluntary.</p><p>Second, <strong>community-level governance</strong>. Municipal oversight bodies can determine which capabilities are permissible within neighbourhoods, under what conditions, and with what limits on data retention. Legally constituted community trusts could require approval and independent auditing for third-party and law-enforcement partnerships.</p><p>Third, <strong>privacy-preserving technical architectures</strong>. Federated learning allows AI models to operate locally on devices without centralising raw data. A neighbourhood system built this way could detect unusual activity without footage ever leaving individual homes. These methods are already deployed in healthcare and finance. Their absence from consumer surveillance products reflects incentive structures, not technical limits.</p><h3>From retreat to redesign</h3><p>Ring’s retreat from the Flock Safety partnership does not resolve the underlying problem. The cameras remain installed. The AI capabilities persist. Partnerships can be quietly reconfigured through different intermediaries. The infrastructure endures.</p><p><a href=""https://arcisai.io/blog/ai-cctv-cameras-for-smart-city"">This pattern extends far beyond Ring</a>. Smart-city CCTV, mobile location tracking, and digital health monitoring follow the same trajectory. Presence becomes participation. Consent becomes assumed. Public concern produces episodic retreats, not structural change. The systems remain intact.</p><p>The question, then, is not whether AI inevitably erodes human agency. It is whether we continue to permit systems to treat mere presence as default input rather than as a condition requiring collective authorisation. In sensor-saturated environments, individual consent loses its protective force. When biometric processing is continuous, public anonymity erodes invisibly. When surveillance infrastructure is centralised, a single breach can undo every promise of safety on which the system was sold.</p><p>Crucially, these systems do not meaningfully self-correct through public discomfort alone. Left unconstrained, data-driven infrastructures expand until legitimacy breaks, at which point withdrawal becomes reputational rather than corrective. Ring’s retreat is best understood not as a resolution, but as a pressure release.</p><p>If AI is to be deployed in the name of safety, it must be governed with mechanisms equal to its reach: transparency that is operational rather than rhetorical, collective decision-making rather than individualised settings, and enforceable limits that bind platforms as tightly as they bind users. What is required are structures that prevent legitimacy crises from accumulating in the first place, rather than relying on backlash to correct them after the fact.</p><p>In environments where visibility has become the default, the task is not to abandon AI. <strong>It is to redesign it so that consent becomes meaningful again: deliberate rather than incidental, collective rather than individual, enforceable rather than assumed.</strong></p><p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aflucas26/""><strong>Andrea Filiberto Lucas</strong></a> is a <a href=""https://www.um.edu.mt/profile/andreaflucas"">Research Support Officer</a> and MSc student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Malta.

<p>There are some brands that, whenever they launch a new moisturizer, immediately have my attention. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tatcha-dewy-milk-moisturizer-review"">Tatcha is absolutely one of them</a> — mostly because it doesn’t happen all that often. In other words, when Tatcha does drop something new, it feels like a Big Deal. </p>



<p>I’ve long admired many of the brand’s cult-favorite formulas — <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tatcha.com%2Fproduct%2Fwater-cream%2FCA05310T.html%3Fcountry%3DUS%26cgid%3Dmoisturizers"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Water Cream</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tatcha.com%2Fproduct%2Fdewy-skin-cream-replenishing-and-plumping-moisturizer%2FCA06310T.html%3Fcountry%3DUS%26cgid%3Dmoisturizers"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dewy Skin Cream</a> (along with the lighter <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tatcha-dewy-milk-moisturizer-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dewy Skin Moisturizer</a> that dropped last year), and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tatcha.com%2Fproduct%2Findigo-overnight-repair-serum%2FCA08210T.html%3Fcountry%3DUS%26cgid%3Dmoisturizers"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Indigo Overnight Cream.</a> All four seem to permanently live on bestseller lists, and for good reason. So when I heard about the latest launch, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tatcha.com%2Fproduct%2Flongevity-cream%2FCA11010T.html%3Fcountry%3DUS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Longevity Memory Cream</a>, I was intrigued. Firstly, by its unique texture. Secondly, it’s anchored in the promise of visibly healthier skin and inspired by Okinawa, Japan’s blue zone, where people live significantly longer. </p>



<p>Ahead, I share my full review after putting Tatcha’s new <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tatcha.com%2Fproduct%2Flongevity-cream%2FCA11010T.html"">Longevity Memory Cream</a> to the test over a month-long trial period. </p>

<h2>What is Tatcha’s Longevity Memory Cream and what are the benefits?</h2>



<p>As the name suggests, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tatcha.com%2Fproduct%2Flongevity-cream%2FCA11010T.html"">The Longevity Memory Cream</a> is rooted in improving elasticity and resilience; think skin barrier support (keeping moisture in and bacteria firmly out), and long-lasting, comforting hydration. The hero ingredient is the Okinawa cellescence complex, a trifecta of Okinawan botanicals including noni juice (an antioxidant-rich, fermented superfood native to Southeast Asia), shell ginger, and Shikuwasa lime — all three of which are also found in <a href=""https://www.tatcha.com/product/the-longevity-serum/CF12010T.html?country=US"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tatcha’s Longevity Serum</a>.  </p>



<p style=""text-align: left;"">Longevity is somewhat of a new beauty buzzword these days, and you wouldn’t necessarily be wrong to think of it as a rebranding of “anti-aging.” However, I believe that the term “longevity” is more about maintaining healthy skin habits than turning back the clock; IMO, as someone who’s worked over a decade in beauty, I’d like to reframe it as a focus on hydrated, brighter skin rather than waging war on wrinkles. They’re totally normal — and inevitable — after all. </p>



<p>Next, there’s hyaluronic acid: We all know about this hydrating powerhouse, and how it draws moisture into the skin, increasing hydration levels. But this cream features <em>bio-fermented</em> hyaluronic acid. The fermentation process helps supercharge the ingredient so that it sinks into the skin faster and better than other forms of hyaluronic acid we know and love. </p>



<p>Lastly, there’s nonapeptide-1. Peptides are the building blocks for proteins, which give skin its supple look and feel. These work alongside the rest of the ingredients to smooth skin texture. </p>



<h2>What makes Tatcha’s Longevity Memory Cream special?  </h2>



<p>Unlike most Tatcha moisturizers I’ve tried, The Longevity Memory Cream has a unique, jelly-like texture that reminds me of pudding; perfectly set in its shape but with a soft, gel-like feel that breaks apart as you scoop it out of the jar. This may be a projection, but the bouncy texture of the cream itself is what my skin feels like after applying it. </p>



<p>At first, this was something I actually didn’t love; it left a tacky residue that I feared would sit atop my skin, rather than absorb fully. However, once I take a heaping spoonful and warm it up a bit in my hands, it sinks into my skin beautifully, leaving behind a radiant glow. (Because of its semi-solid texture, this is a rare instance that I actually use the tiny spoon that fancy face creams like this tend to come with.) </p>



<p>I’m not the only one obsessed with the sensory experience of The Longevity Memory Cream. “This is the memory foam of moisturizers,” Refinery29 beauty director Jacqueline Kilikita adds. “Truly — if I press my finger into it, it leaves an imprint. It eventually settles back into place, but the texture is unlike anything I’ve tried before.” </p>



<p>Besides this, the ingredient nonapeptide-1 caught her attention, mainly because it supports the skin’s natural ceramides. “Without taking you back to biology class, ceramides act like glue between skin cells, keeping everything soft and intact rather than dry and flaky,” says Kilikita. “I always look for them in a moisturizer, so I love that this formula helps encourage them.” </p>



<h2>What to know about Tatcha’s Longevity Memory Cream</h2>



<p>• Has a unique, gel-cream texture, like memory foam. <br />• Contains bio-fermented hyaluronic acid and nonapeptide-1 for bouncy hydration and a supported skin barrier. <br />• Suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin. </p>



<h2>How do you use Tatcha’s Longevity Memory Cream and is it worth it?    </h2>



<p>The Longevity Memory Cream is suitable for morning and<span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;""> </span>nighttime use, which I’m here for since space on my bathroom counter is rare to come by. I especially love it for daytime as a makeup base, since it instantly plumps my skin and eradicates dry, textured patches on my forehead, creating a smooth base for foundation and concealer. Overnight, I apply a little extra, like a face mask, and wake up with soft, supple skin. </p>



<p>Kilikita says it’s one of the best moisturizers she’s used in a long time: “My skin is reactive and prone to redness — especially after cleansing — and I love how cooling this feels on contact.” She adds, “Unlike many lotions in my collection, it sinks in quickly. One spatula-full is enough for my entire face and neck.” </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960721.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=768&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=4%3A3"" /></figure>



<p>As for the long term benefits of “youthful” skin, time will only tell. I’m lucky that at 32, I don’t have fine lines and wrinkles to speak of, but I love how this fits into my routine and addresses my primary skin goals of increasing hydration, brightening, and minimizing texture. But how <em>does </em>it fare on fine lines? “At 33, I’m starting to notice some under my eyes and around my mouth, and I can happily report this softens their appearance thanks to how hydrating it is,” says Kilikita. “I notice it most when I’m wearing makeup; it doesn’t settle into creases in the same way.” </p>



<p>“All in all,” she adds, “this is my new favorite moisturizer, and I’ll be using it down to the last drop — or blob.” </p>



<p>I couldn’t agree more, and have gleaming, hydrated skin as the ultimate testimonial.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2026/02/11960582/baftas-2026-red-carpet-looks"">2026 BAFTAs</a> gave us much to celebrate. Rich, exciting, complex Black filmmaking was given its due, with multiple awards going to Black cinematic artists. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/04/11881716/sinners-movie-ending-explained-wunmi-mosaku-interview"">Blockbuster horror <em>Sinners</em></a>, the British Nigerian coming of age story <a href=""https://www.gbcghanaonline.com/entertainment/my-fathers-shadow-wins-outstanding-debut-at-2026-bafta/2026/""><em>My Father’s Shadow</em>,</a> and British short animation <a href=""https://www.channel4.com/programmes/two-black-boys-in-paradise""><em>Two Black Boys in Paradise</em></a> collectively won an incredible five BAFTAs. <em>Sinners</em> Director <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/04/11884333/sinners-true-story-robert-johnson-ryan-coogler-box-office-success"">Ryan Coogler </a>made history as the <a href=""https://variety.com/2026/film/awards/ryan-coogler-first-black-person-bafta-original-screenplay-1236666022/"">first Black winner</a> for Original Screenplay. It was also a night that recognized the lived reality of <a href=""https://tourette.org/resource/understanding-coprolalia/"">Tourette’s Syndrome and Coprolalia</a>; the emotional, heartwarming <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeWqQN3snCU"">film <em>I Swear</em></a> documents the struggles <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2n9709g0go"">Tourette’s campaigner John Davidson</a> has with the disability, and other people’s ignorance of it. The film won three BAFTAs including a surprising <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgv05r8dgpo"">Best Actor win for lead actor Robert Aramayo</a>.    </p>



<p>Within that celebratory same space, an uncomfortable, unfortunate incident unfolded: one that was difficult for everyone involved, and which has since been stripped of context and complexity by a slew of online commentators who favor uncompromising hot takes over nuance and in doing so, have arguably made a sad situation far worse. </p>



<p>During the live broadcast, an involuntary <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/tourettes-bafta-film-awards-bbc-john-davidson-sinners-1236512321/"">vocal tic from Davidson</a> was picked up by microphones while <em>Sinners</em> <a href=""https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/bafta-awards-2026-tourettes-n-word-outburst"">stars Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo</a> were on stage presenting an award. The outburst included the offensive racist term the n-word, prompting a response from the <a href=""https://people.com/michael-b-jordan-delroy-lindo-onstage-baftas-racial-slur-tourettes-activist-11911616"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ceremony’s host, Alan Cumming</a>, who stated: “If you have seen the film <em>I Swear</em>, you will know that film is about the experience of a person with Tourette syndrome. Tourette syndrome is a disability, and the tics you’ve heard tonight are involuntary, which means the person who has Tourette syndrome has no control over their language. We apologize if you were offended.” Despite being pre-recorded, the moment was broadcast live to millions by the BBC, creating a situation that was distressing for the actors on stage, the audience, and likely Davidson himself, who reportedly later left the ceremony early of his own accord.</p>



<p>It, of course, wasn’t easy to witness two Black people have a racial slur directed at them particularly in such a public manner, and on an evening where their art was being lauded by award ceremonies that historically have underrewarded Black filmmaking. The moment where both Jordan and Lindo register what’s been shouted at them, before almost immediately recomposing themselves and continuing, was a sad and likely familiar scenario to anyone who has ever publicly endured slurs. It was distressing to watch and both the presenters and viewers are entitled to their discomfort and sadness in response to an extremely difficult situation. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>It was distressing to watch and both the presenters and viewers are entitled to their discomfort and sadness in response to an extremely difficult situation. </p><cite>banseka kayembe</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Wider context has been largely absent from much of the online commentary, but here’s what we know about the details leading up to the event: BAFTA reportedly made guests aware in advance of Davidson’s experiences of involuntary vocal tics. I don’t agree with the ignorant arguments that have been fired off that dismiss Tourette’s Syndrome, including suggestions that Davidson should have been banned from the ceremony altogether, and that he was an unrepentant racist who must have meant what he said. Even actor <a href=""https://www.aol.com/articles/jamie-foxx-weighs-michael-b-125419991.html"">Jamie Foxx has chimed in</a> unhelpfully saying on instagram “Nah he meant that sh*t”. It’s quite shocking to hear almost medieval arguments that disabled people be locked away from public view in 2026. Such responses disregard the reality that Tourette’s can be profoundly distressing for those who live with it; involving loss of bodily control, deep shame, and a constant fear of public misunderstanding. </p>



<p>But harm was caused. The word at the centre of this incident carries a specific and brutal history of violence, degradation, and dehumanization directed at Black people; a history that continues to shape lived experience today. In a global political moment marked by the resurgence of openly racist rhetoric, policies, and state violence, audiences are likely even more raw and sensitive to its use. That context does not justify the ableist or deeply unempathetic responses directed at John Davidson. But given that Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo were on stage representing <em>Sinners</em> — a film that directly grapples with the history and ongoing cycle of racism in the United States — it does help explain the depth of feeling, and why this moment which shouldn’t have been aired landed with such visceral force. Who was protecting Jordan and Lindo in the moment, and the Black audience watching? </p>



<p>Variety reported other incidents of Davidson’s Tourettes throughout the ceremony, including  shouting “shut the f-ck up” at BAFTA chair Sara Putt and saying “f-ck you” as the award for best children’s and family film was being accepted. Based on what we know about the disability, these actions were involuntary and not a malicious act. The attempt to ascribe the incident as a personal, moral failure of Davidson’s is wrong and unhelpful. It’s a horrible irony that an evening where a film like <em>I Swear </em>won so much praise has almost immediately been followed with proof of precisely why the film is so necessary. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>It is difficult not to see this as a significant dereliction of duty: a choice that allowed public discomfort, humiliation, and misplaced blame to fall on Jordan, Lindo, and Davidson. </p><cite>banseka kayembe</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The real issue in this story appears to be institutional. The BBC and the BAFTAs made a deliberate editorial decision to air the incident, despite the BAFTAs having been filmed approximately two hours prior to broadcast. This sits uneasily alongside the fact that references to “Free Palestine,” as well as mentions of Congo and Sudan, were trimmed from <em><a href=""https://variety.com/2026/film/awards/bbc-cuts-free-palestine-akinola-davies-jr-baftas-speech-1236670099/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">My Father’s Shadow” </a></em><a href=""https://variety.com/2026/film/awards/bbc-cuts-free-palestine-akinola-davies-jr-baftas-speech-1236670099/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">filmmaker Davies Jr.’s acceptance speech</a>. In response to criticism, a BBC spokesperson stated: “The live event is three hours and it has to be reduced to two hours for its on-air slot. The same happened to other speeches made during the night and all edits were made to ensure the programme was delivered to time. All winners’ speeches will be available to watch via BAFTA’s YouTube channel.”</p>



<p>That explanation raises more questions than it resolves. It is difficult not to see this as a significant dereliction of duty: a choice that allowed public discomfort, humiliation, and misplaced blame to fall on Jordan, Lindo, and Davidson. Given the broadcaster’s clear capacity to edit sensitively and selectively, it is reasonable to ask why this segment was left intact, or why the audio was not muted, particularly when doing so might have mitigated harm for everyone involved. Now, the clip has been shared widely, including the word, causing a firestorm that could have — in part — been avoided. Jordan and Lindo shouldn’t have had to endure that slur being yelled at them, and Davidson shouldn’t have had his disability used against him in such a public manner.  The events that have unfolded suggest the BBC has an institutional bias in terms of what it regards as offensive, which lines up with its <a href=""https://cfmm.org.uk/resource/bbc-on-gaza-israel-one-story-double-standards/"">egregious wider reporting</a> on issues such as the <a href=""https://www.un.org/unispal/document/special-rapporteur-report-gaza-genocide-a-collective-crime-20oct25/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Israeli genocide in Palestine. </a></p>



<p>The BBC issued an apology this morning (ET), hours after the widespread backlash: “We apologise that this was not edited out prior to broadcast and it will now be removed from the version on BBC iPlayer.” By the time the apology was issued, the clip had already circulated widely across social media, fuelling outrage, misinformation, and deeply ableist and racist commentary, and leaving Michael B. Jordan, Delroy Lindo, and John Davidson to absorb the public fallout. There has been no public reflection on addressing the editorial judgement and criteria that allowed it to be broadcast in the first place.</p>



<p>These moments reflect some of the most destructive habits of online political culture, that many Black writers and thinkers have often highlighted as unhelpful in the wider scheme of things. People’s very real grievances can easily be projected onto these more tricky hyper-visible pop culture moments, and a desire for outrage and simplistic, absolutist punishment end up taking precedence over a more serious, empathetic conversation that can encompass multiple things at once. This flawed logic often relies on an explicit hierarchy of suffering, where your suffering must take total priority over another’s, but that framework is neither radical or effective. We live in a world that feels like it’s on fire, and racism is now a visceral daily reality in our politics.  Perhaps the powerlessness people feel means these moments unfairly become proxies for broader, deeper rage at an unjust world that no one seems to know how to fix. It’s a sad rinse and repeat cycle that we’re trapped in.  </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>I know we must handle this with grace and continue to push through. But what made the situation worse was the throw away apology of ‘if you were offended’ at the end of the show. Of course we were offended.</p><cite>‘sinners’ production designer hannah beachler on ‘x’</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>A number of disabled Black people, including some who have Tourtettes have provided far more caring, nuanced perspectives on the situation. <a href=""https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5j3eXb/"">@sh4ysgrwm</a> on TikTok pushed back on the idea that tics can be controlled, clarifying that it’s the result of “neurons misfiring…we have got to stop thinking with our feelings and start thinking with logic. It’s ok to be offended, but it’s not ok to be ableist and try to make it seem like those with Tourettes, specifically those with Coprolelia, say their tics on purpose.” Misunderstanding these conditions can have wider and more troubling consequences. When public opinion and policy defaults to individual moral judgement, it is racialized disabled people who are most likely to face even harsher treatment, disbelief, or punishment. Involuntary tics from Black people are even more likely to be perceived as threatening or dangerous; it’s clearly in everyone’s interests to better understand and support people with these disabilities. </p>



<p>The impact of Davidson’s disability was harmful and many Black disability advocades are calling for him to apologize. I am uncomfortable with the idea of Davidson having to apologize for his disability (although he may personally wish to as I assume he probably felt terrible about it) because of the precedent that sets for disabled people. It’s true that we may be giving this white man more grace than a Black disabled person (especially a Black woman) may get in his situation, but I think the apology and changed behavior really needs to come from the institutions themselves.  </p>



<p>“I keep trying to write about what happened at the <a href=""https://variety.com/t/baftas/"">BAFTAs</a>, and I can’t find the words,” BAFTA nominee and <em>Sinners</em> production designer Hannah Beachler, posted on X after the ceremony, <a href=""https://variety.com/2026/film/global/sinners-hannah-beachler-n-word-slur-baftas-apology-1236670089/"">reported by Variety</a>. “The situation is almost impossible, but it happened 3 times that night, and one of the three times was directed at myself on the way to dinner after the show.. and a third time at a Black woman,” she wrote. “I understand and deeply know why this is an impossible situation. I know we must handle this with grace and continue to push through. But what made the situation worse was the throw away apology of ‘if you were offended’ at the end of the show. Of course we were offended…but our frequency, our spiritual vibration is tuned to a higher level than what happened.. This did not bounce off of me, but I exist above it. It can’t take away from who I am as an artist.” Delroy Lindo later said at one of the BAFTA after parties that he wished <a href=""https://variety.com/2026/film/awards/delroy-lindo-bafta-n-word-michael-b-jordan-1236670222/"">“someone from BAFTA spoke to us afterwards”</a> confirming both BAFTA and the BBC have shown a significant lack of planning, safeguarding and aftercare even after the incident. BAFTA’s lackluster apology during the broadcast sits alongside what appears to be a total lack of accountability for the situation all parties were placed in. </p>



<p>Aside from needing far better media institutions, this episode underlines why art remains indispensable. At its best, it gives us language for experiences we do not have first hand knowledge of, and it asks us to sit with discomfort and contradictions. Many of the best films showcased at the awards resist the urge to collapse human complexity, and the friction that can come with it, into simplistic ideas. A little less time on social media and a bit more time with art might be a good place to start- and it’s clear that the decision-makers at the BAFTAs and BBC need to learn from the very art these institutions are celebrating.   </p>



<p><strong>Editor’s note: </strong><em>Update: John Davidson has <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/tourettes-campaigner-john-davidson-statement-apology-bafta-1236512771/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">released a statement</a></em> <em>that reads, in part,</em> <em>“I appreciated the announcement to the auditorium in advance of the recording, warning everyone that my tics are involuntary and are not a reflection of my personal beliefs.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960571.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/keren_bartov/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Keren Bartov</a> has magic hands — it’s the only explanation for why I left her treatment room with the glowiest skin of my life. But don’t just take my word for it: she’s the celebrity esthetician behind some of the dewiest skin <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/baftas-2026-red-carpet-looks"">at the BAFTAs</a> over the weekend, including <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/teyanataylor/?hl=en"">Teyana Taylor,</a> Jessie Buckley, and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/katehudson/?hl=en"">Kate Hudson</a>. No wonder she’s in such high demand — Bartov’s skincare knowledge is exceptional, and she knows exactly how to make skin look its best under the spotlight.</p>



<p>Bartov is so sought after that she has a four-storey, state-of-the-art facial clinic in London’s Notting Hill. Her clinic might be hi-tech (it promises more beep-boop machines than you could imagine), but Bartov believes it’s how you take care of your skin at home that really matters. </p>



<p>With that in mind, here are all the smart skincare rules I learned from Bartov and her team during a facial treatment.</p>



<h2>Don’t sleep on your cleansing routine</h2>



<p>Cleansing your skin effectively is the best thing you can do for it, according to Bartov. If you’re not lifting away your sunscreen, makeup, and all of the grime you’ve collected throughout the day, any skincare you apply in the evening won’t work to the best of its ability — and that’s a serious waste of both product and money. </p>



<p>Before you do anything, Bartov suggests washing your hands for at least 30 seconds. “Otherwise you’re putting bacteria all over your skin when you want to be washing it off — and that makes no sense at all,” she says. Bartov adds that this step is especially important for those with acne-prone skin, as oil and dirt can easily clog pores.</p>



<p>Simple is best, too. Bartov doesn’t enlist fancy cleansing devices, nor flannels or cloths. Your fingers are the best tools for the job. She recommends double cleansing at the end of the day (washing your face once and following up with a second cleanse, or using micellar water to remove makeup and then doing a proper, water-based cleanse) for at least a minute each time. </p>





<h2>These ingredients are the best for breakouts</h2>



<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/01/10846449/exfoliating-acids-skin-benefits-risks"">benefits of exfoliating acids</a> on acne-prone skin (for both preventing breakouts and minimizing the skin staining left behind) are well known, but it’s how you use them that matters. I often have blackheads, whiteheads, and little under-the-skin pimples, so Bartov layered salicylic acid (which exfoliates deep inside the pore to prevent breakouts) and azelaic acid (another exfoliating acid, which reduces redness and minimizes pigmentation over time). </p>



<p>Look for smart products that contain both, like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fpaula-s-choice-10-azelaic-acid-booster-P469507"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Paula’s Choice 10% Azelaic Acid Booster</a>, which can be combined with a simple moisturizer. </p>



<h2>Wait for your skincare to absorb</h2>



<p>Bartovs clinician said that patience is a virtue when layering serums and moisturizers. She suggested waiting at least three minutes between applying each skincare product so as not to disturb it on the skin and to give it time to fully absorb and work its magic. If it means you have to brush your teeth or tinker around the bathroom for a moment, that’s fine. It’s worth it to get the most out of your skincare. And always take any excess product right down to your neck and chest area, which Bartov said is often neglected. </p>



<h2>Try these three ingredients for rejuvenated skin all year round</h2>



<p>“<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"">Retinol</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-peptide-lip-treatment-balm"">peptides</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-vitamin-c-serum"">vitamin C</a> are important ingredients for stimulating collagen and elastin, and giving a glow to the skin,” said Bartov, who suggests using a retinol serum in the evening only. </p>



<p>Peptides (essentially skin-repairing proteins) are sneaking into all kinds of skincare products lately, particularly moisturizers, and they are tolerated well across the board. R29 rates <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnaturium-multi-peptide-moisturizer-1-7-oz%2F-%2FA-82247120"">Naturium Multi-Peptide Moisturizer</a>, which hydrates, moisturizes, and protects skin. It also features vitamin C to shield against pollution. </p>



<p>If you’re already using a vitamin C serum that you love, follow it up with <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP455369"">The Inkey List Peptide Moisturizer</a>, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP514671"">Paula’s Choice Pro-Collagen Peptide Plumping Gel-Cream Moisturizer,</a> both of which can be used in the morning and the evening. </p>





<p>If you’re using retinol at night, be sure to wear a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wearing-sunscreen-spf-daily-affordable"">broad-spectrum, high-factor sunscreen</a> during the daytime, as retinol can make skin sensitive to sunlight.</p>





<h2>Avoid this one thing if you’re prone to breakouts</h2>



<p>As Bartov mentioned earlier, vitamin C is a brilliant ingredient for protecting skin against pollution and other environmental aggressors, as well as minimizing pigmentation and skin staining. But if you have active breakouts, Bartov suggests avoiding it altogether. L-ascorbic acid is currently a popular form of vitamin C as it’s really potent, but it could irritate in the form of stinging or burning, particularly on open skin. It can be especially irritating at higher concentrations. </p>



<p>While vitamin C is unlikely to make your breakouts worse (or <em>cause</em> them, for that matter), it can make your skin even more sensitive. If you really want to try it, skip the strong stuff and go for something like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vitamin-c-alternatives-sensitive-skin"">ascorbyl glucoside</a>, which is derived from vitamin C. I love <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP442756"">The Ordinary Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12%</a>. Make sure it’s oil-free. </p>





<h2>Take sun safety seriously</h2>



<p>Bartov is the first to admit that she enjoys a handful of vices in life and doesn’t believe in cutting out certain foods or drinks. But basking in the sun is a no-go. Not only does it accelerate the aging process, but it’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mole-mapping-experience-melanoma"">linked to skin cancer</a>. </p>



<p>“I personally enjoy my life,” said Bartov, “but I use products on my skin which stop these free radicals,” — including UV rays and cigarette smoke if you’re around smokers. Vitamin C is a good shield, and when she’s outside in summer, Bartov <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-tinted-moisturizer-sunscreen"">tops up her sunscreen</a> every two hours. If you’re spending time outside in the winter (even just exercising for an hour or heading out on a walk), sunscreen is also a great shout, as UVA rays can penetrate clouds.</p>



<h2>Facial treatments are an investment</h2>



<p>Lastly, home skincare is not to be underestimated. But if you’re experiencing gripes like persistent breakouts or pigmentation, for example, you might like to give a pro treatment a go — budget depending. Bartov specializes in acne, pigmentation, and skin rejuvenation, and while she enlists lasers and lights to enhance the skin, she doesn’t offer injectables <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/masseter-botox-side-effects-jowls"">like Botox</a>. Nor has she had Botox injections herself.</p>



<p>Considering the cost, you’d expect the results of a professional facial to be instant. But I learned that it can take two to three weeks to see the full effects of most treatments. In other words, patience is key. </p>



<p>One thing Bartov would always recommend leaving to the professionals is pore extraction, using either metal tools or your hands. Digging at pimples and blackheads could push bacteria sitting on your skin deep inside pores, potentially making the breakout worse and causing scarring or pigmentation. Bartov suggests layering a spot treatment on top of any breakout (big or small) to bring it down, and letting your face do the rest naturally. Try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Frapid-relief-acne-spot-treatment-P421432%3FskuId%3D1933100%26icid2%3Dproducts%2520grid%3Ap421432%3Aproduct"">Murad Rapid Relief Acne Spot Treatment</a>, which contains spot-busting salicylic acid, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FZitSticka-Patch-Killa-Spot-Clarifying-4pc%2F5604704219"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Zitsticka Killa</a> patches, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FCeraVe-Salicylic-Acid-Acne-Control-Gel-Treatment-Acne-Treatment-for-Face-1-35-fl-oz%2F440953674%3F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">CeraVe Blemish Control Gel</a>, with salicylic acid and oil-reducing niacinamide.</p>

<p>R29 babes — sorry to say this, but <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-enjoy-winter-ideas"">the winter blues</a> we’re all feeling aren’t immediately going to get better from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Mercury’s backspin in Pisces</a> on February 26th. Fear not though because the astrological backspin is going to offer us a way to mend ourselves. Slowly but surely, we’ll feel whole with hope. Trust the process, okay? </p>



<p>Mercury retrograde perpetuates an optical illusion that makes us think the planet is moving backward away from earth, when in fact it’s just moving more slowly. So, communication and travel halt, causing disruptions in how we interact with others. This astrological phenomenon can also disrupt our plans and well being, as unforeseen events occur and we are sluggish from the cosmic force at play. The unpredictability of Mercury <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/signs-from-the-universe-disappointment-setbacks"">creates heightened anxiety</a> because it makes us feel out of control and unable to accomplish tasks quickly. </p>



<p>If one planet can cause all of that commotion, then why do some people revel in the chaos? Mercury retrograde can offer a unique perspective on matters. Since the planet of information and news is kicking back for a few weeks, we should give our minds a break and chill. Easier said than done, right? Not letting the small stuff bother us and gaining a deeper understanding of situations, now that we can look at them more closely allows us to thrive. We have to be mindful of what energy we allow to permeate our lives. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-protect-your-peace"">Protect your peace</a>. </p>



<p>The first Mercury retrograde of 2026 in the water sign Pisces offers us a chance to reconnect with projects and people we love — even if it’s for a fleeting moment. Venus and Mercury retrograde form a conjunction on February 28th, uniting us with a romantic partner or creative venture from the past. We will be inclined to forgive, but not forget. Old wounds might reopen, so be careful in your interactions to avoid heartache from recurring. Although we are resilient, going against our instincts and believing in others we shouldn’t, can sting, if they prove to be untrustworthy. This is a reminder to keep our guard up and boundaries in place. </p>



<p>The sun and Mercury retrograde connect on March 7th, four days after the total lunar eclipse in Virgo. The “cazimi” aspect, which translates from Latin to English as “in the heart of the sun,” offers clarity and decisiveness amid the ambiguity and chaos. We will find enlightenment and be able to make plans to move forward, so we must use it to our advantage. Even though it may not be the light at the end of the tunnel, we can assess matters with a clear mind and determine how we wish to move forward. Think of “cazimi” as a temporary saving grace. </p>



<p>Another important point of the planetary moonwalk is the affiliation between the North Node of Destiny and Mercury retrograde on March 17th. Pay close attention to the events that transpire on this day, as they’ll prove to be pivotal in the future. Situations are unfolding, urging us to seize the moment. Fate is linking us up with people and possibilities that are helping us evolve and grow. Even if the future doesn’t guarantee the outcome we hoped for, it’ll lead us to another amazing place that fulfills our dreams and aspirations. Say yes with caution, to whatever presents itself on March 7th.</p>



<p>The retrograde wraps up on the first day of spring, giving us a fresh start. As we head onward, it’s vital to reflect and share the lessons learned. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960008.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings, you survived the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Aquarius Solar Eclipse</a> and the launch of the Year of the Fire Horse, and honestly… that was a lot. This week shifts the pace. We’re now fully <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">in Pisces Season</a>, and the assignment is simple but not easy: slow down. Go with the flow. Rest without guilt. Dream without immediately turning the dream into a five-step action plan. After last week’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/saturn-in-aries-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Saturn–Neptune conjunction</a>, many of you are receiving quiet downloads about where your energy actually belongs. Trust what’s coming through, even if it doesn’t look “productive” yet. Sitting with your feelings, journaling, meditating, or simply doing less is also progress. Pisces energy reminds us that clarity grows in still water.</p>



<p>On February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings the first reality check since the eclipse. First quarter moons tend to feel like roadblocks or tension points, moments where you realize that the intention you set now needs adjustment. Because this one is in Gemini, the medicine is flexibility. If something isn’t working, don’t double down out of stubbornness. Ask more questions. Look at the situation from another angle. Have the conversation. Pivot if needed. This is less about pushing harder and more about staying curious enough to find a smarter path forward.</p>



<p>Then on February 26th, Mercury shifts retrograde in Pisces, and the emotional weather gets… watery. Focus may feel slippery, timelines may blur, and your mind might drift into nostalgia, daydreams, or full cinematic flashbacks from the past. Miscommunications are possible, especially when feelings are implied instead of spoken clearly. But this retrograde has a gift: it’s powerful for emotional closure, forgiveness, creative reflection, and tying up loose ends your intuition already knows about. People from the past may resurface, memories may stir, and old feelings may ask for acknowledgment. Just remember: feel everything, but stay grounded. Not every emotion is a crisis… sometimes it’s just your heart clearing space for what’s next.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, this week feels like the emotional cool down after being spiritually and energetically “on stage” for most of the month. With the Saturn–Neptune conjunction freshly behind you, you may still be processing major identity downloads… who you are now, what you’re ready to commit to, and what version of you is officially retired. The first full week <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">of Pisces Season</a> asks you to move slower than usual, even if your instinct is to charge forward.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini may bring a mental speed bump… a conversation, decision, or piece of information that makes you rethink your next move. Don’t treat this as a setback. Gemini energy is about adjusting your approach, asking questions, and staying flexible rather than forcing clarity too quickly.</p>



<p>The tone turns even more inward on February 26th, when Mercury begins its retrograde in Pisces, activating your realm of healing, rest, and spiritual closure. As February wraps up, you may feel more introspective, nostalgic, or emotionally sensitive than usual. Old memories, dreams, or unresolved feelings could surface, not to overwhelm you, but to be released. This is a powerful time to unplug, journal, meditate, and tie up emotional loose ends rather than pushing new plans forward. After a month of intense visibility and transformation, the real alignment now comes from solitude and softness. Think of this as your energetic reset before your season arrives.</p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, the first full week <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">of Pisces Season</a> shifts your focus toward connection, community, and your long-term vision for the future. You may feel more emotionally attuned to your friendships, social circles, or online spaces, noticing who feels aligned with the person you’re becoming and who doesn’t quite match your energy anymore. This is a softer, more heart-centered time for collaboration and dreaming with others.</p>



<p>However, on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini activates your money and self-worth zone, bringing a potential reality check around finances, pricing your value, or how much energy you’re giving compared to what you’re receiving. If a small obstacle shows up, don’t panic. Gemini energy asks you to stay flexible, explore options, and adjust your strategy rather than taking it personally.</p>



<p>Things may feel a bit more fluid and unpredictable starting February 26th, when Mercury goes retrograde in Pisces for three weeks. Miscommunications with friends, shifting group dynamics, or social media and tech hiccups are possible. You might even feel the urge to step back from certain platforms or take a break from being constantly available. This retrograde isn’t here to disrupt your peace, it’s here to help you reassess where your energy truly belongs. If plans change or connections feel unclear, resist the urge to control every outcome. Some things are meant to realign on their own. Your job is simply to stay grounded in your values and let the right circles reveal themselves.</p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, the first full week <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">of Pisces Season</a> puts your career, reputation, and long-term direction in the spotlight, but in a softer, more reflective way than you might expect. You may feel more emotionally connected to your work, questioning whether your current path actually aligns with your purpose, not just your skills.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in your sign brings a personal checkpoint. This can feel like a moment of pressure, a decision point, or a sudden realization about how you’re showing up professionally and personally. If something feels like a roadblock, don’t rush to push through it. This is Gemini energy at its best when you pause, gather more information, and adjust your approach rather than forcing a single outcome.</p>



<p>The tone shifts on February 26th, when your ruling planet Mercury shifts retrograde in Pisces. As February wraps up, you may find yourself rethinking a professional goal, reconsidering a public role, or feeling the need to slow down rather than chase the next opportunity. This isn’t the ideal time to launch brand new pitches, apply impulsively for roles, or make major career commitments unless the process began before the retrograde. Instead, think of this as a strategic review period. You’re refining your trajectory, not falling behind. The more honest you are about what success actually looks like for you now, the clearer your next move will be when Mercury moves forward again.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955474.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cancer, as a moon-ruled sign, you’re still feeling the energetic aftershocks of last week’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Aquarius solar eclipse</a> more strongly than most. Eclipses tend to activate your emotional radar, and you may be entering this week feeling heightened, reflective, or aware that something internally has shifted. Now that the cosmic intensity is settling, the first full week of Pisces Season offers a welcome emotional flow. Pisces energy supports your growth, faith, and long-term vision, helping you reconnect with hope after a period of major internal processing.</p>



<p>That sense of forward momentum meets a checkpoint on February 24th, when the First Quarter Moon in Gemini activates your rest, closure, and mental health zone. This can feel like a temporary pause or emotional speed bump, especially if you’ve been pushing yourself to “figure everything out.” You may need more sleep, quiet time, or space away from noise and expectations. Gemini energy here isn’t asking you to solve anything immediately, it’s encouraging you to listen to your inner dialogue and release mental clutter before taking your next step.</p>



<p>The pace shifts further inward on February 26th, when Mercury begins its retrograde in Pisces in your expansion realm for the next three weeks. Plans related to travel, education, publishing, entrepreneurship, or big-picture goals may need to be revisited, delayed, or adjusted. Instead of forcing new launches or committing to major long-term decisions, use this time to refine your vision. You may rediscover an old idea, reconnect with a previous opportunity, or realize your direction needs a slight pivot. This retrograde isn’t blocking your growth, it’s making sure your next leap is aligned with who you’re becoming.</p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, you’re entering this week still processing the emotional intensity <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">of the recent eclipse</a>, and you may feel more aware than usual of your deeper needs and boundaries. The first full week of Pisces Season activates your intimacy, healing, and shared resources zone, pulling your focus beneath the surface. This energy asks you to slow down and get honest about emotional exchanges, financial entanglements, or situations where you’ve been giving more power away than you realized.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a social checkpoint. A conversation with friends, a group dynamic, or a long-term goal may require adjustment. If plans shift or people show you new sides of themselves, stay flexible. Gemini energy here is about recalibrating your network so it reflects where you’re actually headed.</p>



<p>As February winds down, the tone turns even more reflective. On February 26th, Mercury starts its retrograde in Pisces for the next three weeks. You may need to revisit agreements around money, boundaries, or expectations in close relationships. Old feelings could resurface, or past connections may reappear for closure. This isn’t the time to make major financial commitments or merge resources impulsively. Instead, think of this period as emotional and energetic bookkeeping. The more honest you are now about what you share, what you owe, and what you need, the stronger your foundation will be moving forward.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Virgo, this week is all about relationships, reflections, and recalibrating how you show up with others. The first full week <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">of Pisces Season</a> activates your partnership realm, putting the spotlight on one-on-one dynamics in love, business, and close collaborations. You may feel more emotionally attuned to others’ needs, but also more aware of where the balance feels off.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a reality check around your career or public direction. A professional conversation, decision, or expectation could create temporary pressure that spills into your personal life. Gemini energy asks you to stay adaptable and communicate clearly rather than assuming you have to carry everything alone.</p>



<p>Things get more personal on February 26th, when your ruling planet Mercury shifts retrograde in Pisces for the next three weeks. Because Mercury governs you, you’ll feel this shift more strongly than most. Miscommunications, mixed signals, or unresolved dynamics with partners may surface, not to create chaos, but to be addressed honestly. This isn’t the best time to rush into new relationship commitments, sign major contracts, or make emotional ultimatums. Instead, think of this as a relationship review period: old conversations may resurface, past partners could reappear, or you may simply see a current dynamic more clearly. The more patient and transparent you are now, the stronger and more balanced your connections will become.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Libra, you may still be feeling the emotional weight of last week’s Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries, which activated your partnership realm in a major way. Big realizations about commitment, boundaries, or the reality of certain relationships are still settling in. This week isn’t about making dramatic moves, it’s about integrating what you’ve learned and giving yourself space to process how your relationship patterns are evolving.</p>



<p>The first <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">full week of Pisces Season</a> shifts your attention toward your daily life, work rhythms, and overall well-being. This is a softer, more intuitive period for adjusting your schedule so it actually supports your energy. Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini may bring a mental or logistical speed bump around travel plans, learning, or a long-term goal. Stay flexible and open to changing your approach rather than pushing for immediate clarity.</p>



<p>As February winds down, Mercury goes retrograde in Pisces on February 26th for the next three weeks. Expect shifts in your schedule, workplace miscommunications, or a need to revisit health habits and boundaries around how much you’re taking on. This is less about being perfectly productive and more about creating systems that are sustainable. Small adjustments now will make a big difference once Mercury moves forward again.</p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, after the emotional shakeup of last week’s Aquarius solar eclipse, this first full week <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">of Pisces Season</a> feels like a welcome exhale. That eclipse squared Uranus in your partnership realm, bringing unexpected shifts or truths in relationships that may have felt destabilizing in the moment, but ultimately freeing. Now, Pisces energy helps you soften. This is your zone of romance, creativity, joy, and inner child healing, inviting you to date yourself, say yes to what feels fun again, and allow love to flow both ways. You may notice your mood lifting, your creativity returning, and your desire for play coming back online. Let this be a lighter week… you’ve earned it.</p>



<p>On February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a practical checkpoint around shared finances, debts, or long-term wealth planning. This could surface as a small speed bump or reality check, but Gemini energy keeps the tone lighter than usual. Instead of spiraling, approach your situation with curiosity and even a little humor. This is a good time to explore multiple income streams or rethink how you’re managing resources, just be mindful not to overcommit or take on more than you can realistically handle.</p>



<p>As February wraps up, Mercury begins its retrograde in Pisces on February 26th, also in your romance and creativity zone. Over the next three weeks, nostalgia may hit hard. Old flames, familiar dynamics, or rose-colored memories could resurface, making the past look sweeter than it actually was. Stay grounded. This retrograde is less about rekindling old patterns and more about healing them. Use this time for rest, creative reflection, and reconnecting with the version of you that feels playful, expressive, and emotionally safe.</p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, the first full <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">week of Pisces Season</a> pulls your focus inward toward home, family, and your emotional foundation. After the intensity and movement of the past few weeks, this energy asks you to slow down and tend to your inner world. You may feel the urge to nest, rest, or spend more time with the people and spaces that make you feel safe. Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a relationship checkpoint. A conversation, decision, or difference in perspective could surface with a partner or close collaborator. Gemini energy here isn’t about conflict, it’s about communication. Stay curious, ask questions, and avoid jumping to conclusions.</p>



<p>As February winds down, Mercury shifts retrograde in Pisces on February 26th for the next three weeks. Plans around living situations, family matters, or domestic routines may shift, or old memories and feelings could resurface. This isn’t the time to rush major moves or make permanent decisions about your living environment unless the process began earlier. Instead, use this period to reorganize your space, revisit emotional boundaries, and create a home life that actually supports your energy. Slowing down now will give you the stability you’ll need for the momentum ahead.</p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the first full <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">week of Pisces Season</a> shifts your focus toward communication, learning, and the conversations shaping your day-to-day life. You may feel more reflective than usual, noticing how your words, thoughts, and mental habits are affecting your energy. This is a softer, more intuitive time for writing, brainstorming, or having heart-centered conversations.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a practical checkpoint around your work routines, responsibilities, or health habits. A small scheduling issue, workload adjustment, or energy dip could surface. Gemini energy asks you to stay flexible and tweak your systems rather than pushing yourself harder.</p>



<p>As February wraps up, Mercury begins its retrograde in Pisces for the next three weeks. Expect delays, crossed wires, or the need to revisit conversations, paperwork, or short-term plans. This isn’t the best time to rush contracts, announcements, or major decisions unless they’ve been in motion already. Instead, use this period to edit, review, and clarify. Slowing down your pace and double-checking details now will save you time and stress once Mercury moves forward again.</p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, after such a personal and intense stretch, the first full <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">week of Pisces Season</a> shifts your focus toward grounding and rebuilding your sense of stability. This energy activates your money, self-worth, and values zone, encouraging you to slow down and get clear about what actually feels sustainable. You may find yourself reassessing where your time and energy are going and whether the return feels aligned.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a creative or emotional checkpoint. Something related to dating, a passion project, or how you’re expressing yourself may need a small adjustment. Gemini energy asks you to stay playful and flexible rather than taking the moment too seriously.</p>



<p>As February comes to a close, Mercury begins its retrograde in Pisces in your financial and self-esteem sector for the next three weeks. Payments, budgeting plans, or income conversations may shift or require review. This isn’t the time for major financial risks or impulsive purchases unless they were already planned. Instead, use this period to reassess your spending, renegotiate your value, and reconnect with what actually makes you feel secure. Slow and intentional moves now will help you build a stronger foundation moving forward.</p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, this first full week <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">of your solar return season</a> puts you back at the center of your own story. After the intensity and collective shifts of the past few weeks, the energy now asks you to move at your pace, not the world’s. You may feel more sensitive, intuitive, and aware of what your body and emotions actually need.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a checkpoint around home, family, or your emotional foundation. A conversation, scheduling shift, or small tension in your living environment may require flexibility. Gemini energy here is a reminder to stay adaptable and communicate rather than internalize everything.</p>



<p>Things turn even more introspective on February 26th, when Mercury begins its three-week retrograde in your sign. Since this is happening in your identity and personal expression zone, you may feel more reflective, nostalgic, or uncertain about how you want to show up. Old versions of yourself, past decisions, or unfinished emotional stories could resurface. This isn’t the time to rush major reinventions or make bold personal announcements. Instead, treat this as a personal reset. Journal, rest, revisit your intentions, and let clarity come back to you naturally. The more gentle and honest you are with yourself now, the more aligned your next chapter will feel.</p>

While we have been fans of the Korean-Australian actor since <em>Halo</em> and <em>Bad Behaviour</em>, her breakout role in <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/10/11938163/bridgerton-season-4-details-cast-love-story-characters"">Bridgerton</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/10/11938163/bridgerton-season-4-details-cast-love-story-characters""> Season 4</a> as Sophie Baek has put her on the map worldwide. As the first <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2022/03/10896653/asian-australian-women-online-communities"">East Asian</a> to lead the Regency romance drama, she continues to break boundaries and offer representation for those less seen on screen.</p>



<p>As a rising star, Ha has also been hand-picked by SAG-AFTRA to become the Ambassador for <a href=""https://www.actorawards.org/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Actor Awards</a>, which will air live on March 2. The star will be sharing behind-the-scenes content and participating in multiple pre-show events.</p>



<p>“Being named The Actor Awards Ambassador is such an honor because this ceremony is about actors celebrating actors,” Ha said. “There is something uniquely powerful about being recognised within your own community. As someone who cares so deeply about the craft and about collaboration, it means so much to represent the next generation of actors and be part of an event that uplifts storytelling.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>There is something uniquely powerful about being recognised within your own community.</p><cite>Yerin Ha</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Ha follows in the footsteps of previous SAG-AFTRA Ambassadors such as Sofia Carson, Haley Lu Richardson, Antonia Gentry and Alexandra Daddario.</p>



<p>The <em>Bridgerton </em>star was most recently seen at Gold House’s Lunar New Year party, where <a href=""https://people.com/bridgerton-yerin-ha-says-former-leads-simone-ashley-and-nicola-coughlan-have-been-lovely-and-supportive-exclusive-11681027"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">she opened up to </a><em><a href=""https://people.com/bridgerton-yerin-ha-says-former-leads-simone-ashley-and-nicola-coughlan-have-been-lovely-and-supportive-exclusive-11681027"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">People</a></em> about East-Asian representation on screen. “It’s been really, really amazing and beautiful. I mean, I’ve been really caught up with the [<em>Bridgerton</em>] press tour, so I don’t think I’ve been too [online], Ha said. “It has been really positive and I just feel so proud that I get to be the face of that and keep advocating for change, and knowing that we deserve these roles and spaces.”</p>



<p><em>Bridgerton</em> Season 4 Part 2 will be released on February 26, and will see Ha’s Sophie (hopefully) win Benedict’s heart and become a true leading lady. In a time where the world can seem overwhelming, it’s lovely to be able to celebrate Ha and her successes.</p>

<p>My feed has been completely taken over by fans lamenting that they haven’t been able to secure <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/05/9781230/hilary-duff-kids-luca-banks-mom-advice-media"">Hilary Duff</a> tickets for <a href=""https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a70327671/how-to-buy-hilary-duff-the-lucky-me-tour-tickets/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Lucky Me Tour</a>. From people sliding into the pop star’s DMs to beg her to add more dates, to countless memes and TikToks from those who missed out, it’s clear that <a href=""https://lifestyle.si.com/news/hilary-duff-pens-love-letter-to-fans-following-new-album-release"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hilary Duff fever</a> has landed. During the first Mastercard pre-sale in Australia where I live, there were over 50,000 fans in the queue. Aside from the fact that Duff hasn’t toured here for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/ipod-noughties-tech-nostalgia"">18 years</a>, the demand could tie into this interesting trend of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/gen-z-nostalgia-millennial-experience"">pop culture selling nostalgia</a> — a sure-fire way to tap into already established audiences. </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/apr/28/that-yearning-feeling-why-we-need-nostalgia"">According to psychologists</a>, nostalgia is a powerful tool. It has the ability to increase self-esteem, help people form social bonds, soothe anxiety, boredom and stress, as well as being positive for your mental health. One fan tells me a <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15562273/Hilary-Duff-tour-fans-engaged-las-vegas.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">connection with Hilary Duff</a> transports her back to when times felt safer and easier. “They weren’t lying when they said ‘don’t grow up’. I was really lucky growing up, I had a beautiful childhood, with a big family, everything was simple back then and the world felt beautiful and full of colour,” fan Sakara Bell says. “I’ll never forget the Christmas when I unwrapped her album <em>Most Wanted</em>. I played <em>Beat Of My Heart </em>on repeat for months and never got tired of it.”</p>



<p>Anita Tran, who was lucky enough to purchase tickets, says nostalgia is “powerful” right now. “It transports me back to when my biggest worry was whether I’d make it back home in time to watch my favourite Disney Channel shows. A time where my first crush was <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7530306456667622687"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chad Michael Murray</a> in <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/01/10259591/one-tree-hill-james-lafferty-now-engaged-career"">One Tree Hill</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/01/10259591/one-tree-hill-james-lafferty-now-engaged-career""> </a>or I first understood what love meant watching <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2021/09/10678647/best-2000s-tv-shows-teens"">Dawson’s Creek</a></em>. It’s sweet, it’s innocent, and it’s just safe,” Tran adds. “Hilary is my childhood. <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"">She takes me back to my youth, where a cartoon <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lizzie-mcguire-hair-makeup"">Lizzie McGuire</a> </em>narrated my exact teenage thoughts, and <em>Metamorphosis </em>was the album my besties and I blasted on the way home from school</span>.” Other fans echoed the same sentiment, with one wanting to “heal her inner teen”, and another says Duff “genuinely influenced her personality as a child”. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Being able to experience something that is your childhood, is everything and more.</p><cite>Sakara Bell, Hilary Duff Fan</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Duff’s triumphant return to pop music is not only a reclaiming of her story, and finally being able to write the music <em>she always wanted to write</em>, but it ties into a larger theme of how we’re seeing the world. The <a href=""https://dictionary.apa.org/nostalgia"">definition of nostalgia</a> is wanting to return to a time of life where things seemed better than the present, and with the current political climate, consumers are more desperate for nostalgia than ever. With an ongoing <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/palestine-mothers-children-gaza-solidarity"">genocide in Gaza</a>, <a href=""https://psychology.org.au/insights/the-australian-women-dreading-change-in-trump%E2%80%99s-am"">Trump rolling back women’s rights</a>, and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2026/02/11959006/celebrity-political-statements-grammys-super-bowl"">issues of ICE in the USA</a>, it seems almost impossible to go through life without being faced with a new horrific truth. Shared nostalgia gives us an escape, where we can come together and bond as a community. </p>



<p>It’s no surprise that brands have commodified nostalgia. If you were wondering why there have been endless amounts of reboots (did we <em>really</em> need <em>Zoey 102</em>?), and beloved childhood toys like <em>Barbie</em> getting the big-screen treatment, there’s a reason. <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/41/3/713/2907535"">Research shows</a> that nostalgia can “decrease people’s desire for money”. People are more willing to open their wallets and pay more for products. <em><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/4JlqOqhImVEFmH4ue7GbVH"">Culture Club</a> </em>co-host and writer Jasmine Wallis agrees, believing that while she loves nostalgia, a big part of it is capitalism. “Millenials and older Gen Z’s (like Hilary’s fans) are entering adulthood in a really tough economy. So, while having kids and buying a house feels like a huge struggle and sacrifice, attending concerts like Hilary’s can offer a sense of joy for just $200,” Wallis says. “It takes us back to childhood whilst also offering a reprieve from adulthood. Executives and corporations know this and so are playing into it.” Duff fan Sakara Bell is aware of this marketing tactic, but it doesn’t turn her off at all. “I don’t really care. As cringy as it is, you only live once, and I’m a big believer in money comes and goes,” Bell says. “Being able to experience something that is your childhood, is everything and more.” </p>

<p>Nostalgia isn’t even exclusive to your own childhood, either. <a href=""https://theharrispoll.com/briefs/millennials-lead-american-optimism-for-the-future/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Even Gen Z are tapping into nostalgia</a> for the 1990s, including those who weren’t alive at the time. The pre-digital era is coveted by those who believe we’re spending too long doomscrolling. According to a study in the US, two-thirds of Gen Z adults wished to return to a world before we were all “plugged in”. </p>



<p>Perhaps that’s why Hilary Duff has completely taken over in Australia. It’s about more than just her hits (but she has great bops, to be fair), and more about society and how we yearn for a simpler, kinder time in life. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960290.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>When I say I’ve watched the rise and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/body-inclusivity-in-fashion-2025"">fall of size inclusion</a> at <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/search?q=nyfw"">New York Fashion Week</a>, I really mean it. <br /><br />I was at the runway of <em>the</em> first plus-size designer on the official NYFW calendar (Eden Miller’s Cabiria, showing at Mercedes Benz Fashion Week back in 2013). A year later, I was there when <a href=""https://www.elle.com/fashion/a45139956/plus-size-new-york-fashion-week/"">Chromat opened their SS15 show with plus model Denise Bidot</a> — and I made a very un-fashion-week-like exclamation of excitement when I saw her step onto the runway. I saw Christian Siriano go from a straight size designer to a plus fashion collab with Lane Bryant, to dressing plus celebrities for the red carpet, to becoming one of the designers known for dressing <em>every</em> body once he normalized <a href=""https://www.glamour.com/story/5-plus-size-models-just-walked-in-christian-sirianos-fashion-show"">including multiple plus models on the runway in 2016</a>.<br /><br />For a glorious while, it felt like progress was inevitable and the number of plus models walking NYFW would just keep going up… and then the pandemic hit. And then <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/body-positivity-movement-fat-black-women-weight-loss"">the rise of Ozempic</a> for weight loss hit. And suddenly, progress hadn’t just ground to a halt — we were going backwards. <br /><br />As someone who has been <a href=""https://www.elle.com/elleextra/events/a46688773/fashioning-a-more-size-inclusive-nyfw-panel-discussion/"">pushing for size inclusion in fashion</a> for over a decade, it is beyond disheartening to see the tiny bit of hard-fought progress we made being pushed back so rapidly. I’ve loved fashion since I was a little kid (I was the 5 year-old seeking out copies of <em>Vogue</em> and <em>Elle</em> at the local library), and I still get a thrill from covering NYFW even after a decade plus of doing so. But sometimes I look at the CFDA calendar before a season starts and feel my anxiety rising, because I just know there probably will be little to no size diversity to come. <br /><br />That bad-gut feeling was sadly correct this season. The official numbers aren’t in yet, but this might have been one of the least size diverse New York Fashion Weeks in recent history — and that bar is <em>low</em>.<br /><br />Now, some of this season’s dip can be attributed to certain brands sitting the season out. Last season, I saw the bulk of visibly plus size representation at plus-specific shows like<a href=""https://www.reneecafaroatelier.com/""> Renee Cafaro Atelier</a> and plus fashion label <a href=""https://www.eloquii.com/"">Eloquii</a>’s NYFW debut. Size inclusive designers like <a href=""https://rachelantonoff.com/"">Rachel Antonoff</a> and Kimberly Gordon of <a href=""https://selkiecollection.com/"">Selkie</a> can always be counted on for truly diverse runways too, but neither showed this season. <a href=""https://www.alexisbittar.com/"">Alexis Bittar</a> is another designer that I always find casts without discriminating against larger bodies (last season’s pageant-themed presentation was filled with dolls of every size), but this year’s visceral, violent, and excellent vignette just included one model (and one victim), so size diversity wasn’t applicable this time around. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p><strong>But all that just highlights the fact that it shouldn’t be on a handful of designers to carry all of the representation at Fashion Week. Because when they change their format or skip a season, the absence is keenly felt. </strong></p><cite>Sarah Chiwaya</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>These feelings are <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/fashion/skinny-models-ozempic-glp1.html"">supported by the data</a>: We’ve not yet seen the numbers from this season, but last season the representation was insignificant, with less than 1% plus models on the runway, and 97.1% of models sizes 0-4. Given that the average U.S. size is closer to a 16/18 (and <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm"">recent CDC data</a> shows that that size is holding true even after years of aggressive marketing of GLP-1s for weight loss), that is nothing short of abysmal. <br /><br />To be clear, we’ve never approached anything even CLOSE to equitable runway representation (which would mean at least 67% curve models). Indeed, we’ve barely even cracked 5% — and that’s with the most generous calculations. Tokenization, which is not real representation, has often been the norm over the last decade, but there’s nothing like seeing <em>zero</em> curves on the runway to put the absence of even that little bit of size diversity into sharp relief. <br /><br />I wasn’t alone in feeling it, either. Bella Gerard, a fashion editor and author of <a href=""https://bellagerard.substack.com/"">Substack’s B List</a>, also noted the blatant regression: “Above all else, the lack of body diversity on the runway this season just feels so…disappointing,” she noted. “It’s not breaking news that attempts at inclusivity are often performative in the fashion sphere, but this season really proved a ‘one step forward, three steps back’ reality. Not only was there next to no curve representation, but the straight size models looked even thinner than in recent years, calling back to an era of thinspo I thought we’d collectively renounced and evolved past.” </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960212.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960213.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Fortunately, there were some bright points this season too, with top designers whose visions of fashion were not constrained to just one type of girl. On the first day of shows, <a href=""https://collinastrada.com/"">Collina Strada</a> showed a deliciously darkly romantic-yet-eclectic collection, replete with high <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/09/11778397/beetlejuice-beetlejuice-fashion-costumes"">Victorian lace collars</a>, blurred prints, volume play, and body baring dropped-waist silk dresses that looked equally hot on straight and plus size models. Later that evening, <a href=""https://www.jane-wade.com/"">Jane Wade</a>’s show — titled “The Summit” — was an innovative fashion expedition, with conifers on the runway, tents on dresses (and <em>as</em> dresses), and survival-ready fabrications merged with Wade’s signature suiting and elevated officewear. (The story of a corporate woman dreaming of an escape to nature is crucially not one limited by size.)<br /><br />And at New York Men’s Day, <a href=""https://www.a-potts.com/"">A.Potts</a> showed a distinctive style of oversized, genderless clothing on a cast that included both age diversity and an even more underrepresented category: Male plus models. Designer Aaron Potts is no stranger to size diverse casting, either: Prior seasons have included plus models, and I — a size 20 — was actually one of the models for the launch of his new diffusion label Werkshop by A.Potts (which was also featured in his NYMD presentation). <br /><br />I allowed myself a little hope after that good first day, but as the week went on and I saw more shows with <em>zero</em> curve models than not, the lack of size inclusion just felt more and more pronounced. Industry friends who knew I was reporting on size inclusion this season would occasionally text me curve model sightings. “Paloma on the runway at Proenza.” “One curve model at Gabe Gordon.” “I think two? at Eckhaus Latta.” Every message was appreciated, but the underlying implication that we needed to be eagle-eyed to spot even a smidgeon of size inclusion was a downer. <br /><br />Then there were the false positives, driven by the emerging trend of adding mass to thin bodies with clothing. I saw countless peplums, panniers, and padded pieces throughout the week, and as I was desperately searching for a hint of curve and trying to parse a tall size 8 curve model from her size 4 contemporary, I occasionally got excited only to realize that was just a straight size model with fabric curves added on. It felt like I was playing an unwitting (and unwelcome) game of “curve model or just a structured hip?” When there’s so little visual difference between straight and curve models — who do not typically wear <em>actual</em> plus sizes, paradoxically — the facade of inclusion shatters even more.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960287.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>Shows with organic diversity, like <a href=""https://kimshui.net/"">Kim Shui</a>’s richly textured, color-forward FW26 show, were some of the bright points of the season, but were sadly the exceptions, not the rule. Age diversity did seem to be on the uptick, too — with gorgeous older models in shows including <a href=""https://www.carolinaherrera.com/us/en/"">Carolina Herrera</a>, <a href=""https://diotima.world/"">Diotima</a>, and the relaunch of <a href=""https://dereklam.com/"">Derek Lam</a> with new creative director Robert Rodriguez at the helm.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p><strong>Yet as I saw runway after runway composed exclusively of the thinnest models, the scattered tips I was getting about curve models on the runway started to feel like rare sightings of an endangered species.</strong> </p><cite>Sarah Chiwaya</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>As someone with 25 seasons of NYFW under my belt and who has dedicated my career to the push for more and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wray-closing-plus-size-community-impact"">better for plus size women</a>, I am always wary when there’s a category that seems like the chosen diversity <em>du jour. </em>True representation should be across the board and not a passing trend, with an ongoing emphasis on making sure underrepresented groups can see themselves in fashion. I’ve obviously clocked this, but other fashion industry vets have noted it as well. <br /><br />In <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/fashion/skinny-models-ozempic-glp1.html"">a recent piece for the <em>New York Times</em></a>, top fashion critic Vanessa Friedman noted that the recent shift extends well beyond the catwalk: “The gravitational pull is toward an ever-shrinking human form, especially on the runway,” she wrote. “It’s too bad. Not because skinniness is bad, but because it should not be the only option. People still come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. Seeing the reality of life reflected on the runways, which have become a form of entertainment for everyone, is actually more appealing than seeing life reduced to one size that cannot fit all.<br /><br />Designers who really understand that appeal also know that it’s good for their bottom line. Committing to size inclusivity isn’t just the ethical thing to do — it’s good business sense, too. Take Christian Siriano, who <a href=""https://www.elle.com/fashion/celebrity-style/a21529009/christian-siriano-tripled-his-business-by-adding-plus-sizes/"">extolled the fiscal virtues of size inclusion back in 2018</a>, saying: “Adding plus sizes to my line tripled my business. Why wouldn’t you do that?!” <br /><br />This season, when asked about diversity in casting, he echoed that sentiment, exclaiming that it was “so important!” Last week, the designer punctuated this belief visually by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DU659FZiSdq/"">sending the same silhouette down the runway on two different body types</a>. “I love how you can see they look amazing in the same dress, in the same look,” he told me backstage. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960215.jpg?width=854&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=427%3A512"" /></figure></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960216.jpg?width=854&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=427%3A512"" /></figure></div>



<p>When designers approach representation as part of their brand identity, it effortlessly translates to the audience. Both legendary R&amp;B singer Monica and <em>the </em>Whoopi Goldberg independently praised Siriano’s commitment to making fashion for all backstage. “It was absolute elegance, and it was for every size, shape, color and creed, so many different types of women — and men! — in the show,” Monica noted. “Gives you all sorts of inspiration!” Goldberg summed it up even more succinctly: “Christian’s work just always inspires me and makes me so happy, because we can all wear it.”<br /><br />That type of organic inclusion was also evident in <a href=""https://chukscollins.com/"">Chuks Collins</a>’s striking presentation, which ranged from lush topstitched knits to sharp suits to stunning structured ballgowns, all shown on a range of sizes and body types. (Collins was heavily influenced by how scarification, purposeful, ritual, and otherwise, can play into the way we present ourselves to the world.)<br /><br />“I grew up seeing people that look like you, people that look like me,” Collins said. “My mom is not a size 2. My grandmother, who taught me to sew, she’s not a size 10. About 40 to 50% of my clients are plus size people. So I am not going to lie to myself and say ‘oh, my demographic, my ideal demographic is a size 2 to 4.’”<br /><br />For Collins, who started the brand in 2006, building a collection for customers of all sizes is both a labor of love and a practical financial matter — after all, he’s building a label he wants to last. “I have to create clothes that people see themselves in, that they want to wear. With that, I’m becoming a successful business,” he noted. “I also just love dressing people with curves, because that’s what I started doing, that’s how I started my career. So I’m not going to — because of what, industry standards? — I’m not going to include that? And I love women. I love beautiful women with curves. I tell the stories of how I feel, and my work is a representation of myself.” <br /><br />In the end, an outsized portion of the size diversity this season came from emerging designers and those making their CFDA debuts, such as Menyelek Rose of the eponymous label <a href=""https://www.menyelek.online/"">Menyelek</a>. Designer <a href=""https://www.andrewcurwen.com/home"">Andrew Curwen</a>, meanwhile, showed a sexy, directional, and haunting (complimentary!) collection. “Nocturnal Conditions” looked stunning on every figure, and the diverse cast (by F10 Casting agency) felt simultaneously natural and intentional. <br /><br />Camryn Mcclain of <a href=""https://reneenyc.com/"">RENÉE NYC</a> also cited body diversity as integral to her inspiration: “For casting this season, we focused on different characters of everyday people of various shapes and sizes that reflect what I see in the city,” Mcclain said. That thoughtfulness complemented a presentation of some of the most interesting knitwear I’ve seen lately, with bold braiding and fringe details rendered in rich jewel tones and gilded neutrals. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960219.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960220.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>“I want my collection to inspire and be inclusive for everyone,” said <a href=""https://veejayfloresca.com/"">Veejay Floresca</a>, another designer on the CFDA calendar for the first time. “I worked with my team to cast models across sizes, races, ages, and gender identities so that everyone can see themselves in the collection I created. It is so important to me that everyone feels beautiful and can express themselves freely and I hope my collection can bring this to all of my customers.” <br /><br />The casting fully reflected that, with a stunning range of bodies (including <em>Project Runway</em> star plus model Liris Crosse) all looking occasion-ready in sumptuous gowns and suiting. Floresca’s <em>Project Runway</em> mentor Christian Siriano was also in attendance, and it felt both poetic and prophetic that Floresca is also adding to the legacy of embracing true runway diversity. <br /><br />As New York Fashion Week wrapped, social media was only beginning to set itself ablaze with <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DU6qBxcEmoA/?img_index=1"">reactions to the new Netflix documentary centered on <em>America’s Next Top Model</em></a>, particularly  the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/harmful-beauty-standards-artificial-intelligence"">impossible beauty standards</a> that persisted then and seem intent on making a vicious comeback today. While reactions to the show — and the harmful standards that were upheld in the era of <em>ANTM — </em>are rightfully horrified, it’s worth looking at the present in the same lens.<br /><br />Fashion is meant to be forward-looking, creative, and progressive, but all too often falls into the “that’s just the way things are” default.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p><strong>Designers letting themselves off the diversity hook now, thinking the current wave of regressive and exclusionary ideals will be an excuse, will inevitably find themselves on the wrong side of history. </strong></p><cite>Sarah Chiwaya</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>For now, the bright spots and the designers that see fashion for all will keep me going. As Curwen said after his show: “Those who are told ‘no’ the most in the industry are the ones we pay the most attention to.” In doing so, Curwen and designers like him set themselves apart from the crowded field of brands all targeting the least populous market (aka straight sizes). Here’s hoping the industry gets on board with this more expansive view of who belongs in fashion, and other designers see the opportunity that true inclusion presents, for both business and the human obligation. </p>
