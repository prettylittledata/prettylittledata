The program integrates sustainably into the town of Saint-Émilion, listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO since 1999; the project is both a place of production and promotion. The four main areas dedicated to the wine-making process are the harvest receiving area, the vat room, and the barrel cellars. For the reception of private clients, the project includes a tasting room as well as a reception room that can accommodate approximately 100 people. The project is a direct commission which continues a long-standing relationship, initiated some twenty years ago, between the Moueix family and Herzog &amp; de Meuron.

More than a house for local administration, the Hilversum <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/town-hall"">Town Hall</a> became the architectural expression of a community in transformation. With its tower rising above reflective ponds, its brick masses composed around courtyards, and its carefully detailed interiors, the building asserted that civic architecture could unite function with symbolism, efficiency with ceremony.</p>",

He and his team had successfully transformed a newspaper into performance art. What seemed like an impossible dream was now reality.</em></p><h3>The Business Results</h3><p>Utko’s extraordinary design work demonstrates that strategic, user-focused design significantly enhances business performance and reader engagement.</p><p>The amount of awards and revenue created by Jacek and his team are inspiring:</p><ul><li><strong>Increased Circulation by Up to 100%:</strong> Utko’s redesigns for newspapers in Eastern Europe, including titles in Poland, Russia, Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Latvia, consistently boosted circulation, with some publications seeing increases of up to 100% due to enhanced visual appeal and reader engagement.</li><li><strong>35% Circulation Growth in Poland:</strong> A Polish newspaper Utko redesigned saw a 35% circulation increase over three years, reversing nearly a decade of stagnation, by aligning design with business goals and reader preferences.</li><li><strong>Boosted Ad Revenue: </strong>His redesigns, such as for Bonnier’s business publications, led to increased advertising revenue, often by as much as 100%, by creating visually compelling layouts that attracted advertisers.</li><li><strong>Award-Winning Designs: </strong>Utko’s redesigns won the Society of News Design (SND) “World’s Best Designed Newspaper” award in 2004 and 2007 for Warsaw’s Puls Biznesu, enhancing brand prestige and marketability.</li><li><strong>European Newspaper of the Year Awards: </strong>Three newspapers he redesigned were recognized as European Newspaper of the Year in 2015, 2016, and 2019, driving higher readership and industry recognition.</li><li><strong>Global Impact Across 35 Countries:</strong> Utko’s redesigns for dozens of newspapers and magazines in Europe, Asia, Australia, and Africa (e.g., Singapore, South Africa) consistently increased readership and revenue, leveraging strategic design.</li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Beyond the extraordinary business results from McKinsey, Harvard, Forbes, and Adobe, the world can easily see in this simple example that design has the transformative power as a spark for innovation and a driver of business value.</p><p><em>Jacek not only proved that good design can help readers reconnect with newspapers, but he also proved that good design can bring a dying industry back from the edge of extinction.</em></p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/8229a39f9e4605e7d4bc15e0cd1867aa/href"">https://medium.com/media/8229a39f9e4605e7d4bc15e0cd1867aa/href</a><p>And he accomplished this by going beyond just aesthetics by improving the overall product and aligning content and design with a clear strategy. He collaborated with business leaders every step of the way.</p><p>Jacek is now an art director for the Bonnier Business Press, overseeing papers in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states, and the work he oversees consistently wins major prizes (including another SND world’s-best in 2007 for Estonia’s <em>Äripäev</em>), despite their small teams and limited resources.</p><figure><img alt=""Jacek Utko quote: Design can change everything in your company; it can turn your company upside down.

<h4>The future of work in the age of AI and deepware.</h4><p>There is a photograph from 1930s East London that should be mandatory viewing for anyone anxious about AI taking their job. It shows Mary Smith, a “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knocker-up"">knocker-up</a>” — <strong>a woman whose entire profession consisted of walking the streets at dawn, shooting dried peas at bedroom windows with a long bamboo pole to wake workers for their factory shifts.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Photograph from 1930s showing Mary Smith, a “knocker-up,” wielding a bamboo pole with dried peas, shooting them at bedroom windows to wake factory workers."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*rkCJ0XioJKqdRXNE.jpg"" /><figcaption>Mary Smith, a “knocker-up” in East London (1930s)</figcaption></figure><p>Mary charged sixpence a week for this service. Then the alarm clock arrived, and Mary’s job vanished.</p><p>Do we mourn the knocker-up today? Do we rage against the tyranny of the alarm clock? Of course not. Because what happened to Mary is what has happened throughout every technological revolution: certain tasks became obsolete whilst entirely new categories of work emerged.</p><p>Yet here we are in 2025, gripped by the same ancient panic. <em>AI is coming for our jobs</em>, we are told. The robots will replace us. The future is bleak.</p><blockquote>Let me offer a different provocation: AI is not coming for your job. It is coming for your tasks. And if you cannot distinguish between the two, then yes — you should be worried.</blockquote><h3>The evolution we refuse to see</h3><p>Human work has always been in flux. In nomadic societies, we hunted and gathered. Agriculture tethered us to land and rhythms of seasons. Industrialisation moved us into factories, trading physical labour for wages. The information age shifted us again — this time from brawn to brain, from making things to managing data, information, and knowledge.</p><p>Each transition has redefined not just what we do, but what remains uniquely human about work. We moved from physical exertion to cognitive processing. Now we have built what I call “<a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/when-deepware-meets-wetware-the-uncomfortable-truth-about-responsible-ai-245842121749""><em>deepware</em></a>” — neural networks and machine learning systems layered atop our traditional software and hardware. <br />These architectures can process, pattern-match, and produce at speeds we cannot fathom. Yet in our rush to innovate, we have convinced ourselves that <em>deepware</em> can carry the weight of responsibility our <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetware_(brain)""><em>wetware</em></a> — our human brains and nervous systems — seems increasingly willing to surrender. We are moving again, but this time the question is whether we are moving forward or simply moving away.<br />Because this time, the shift is not from physical to mental. It is from execution to <strong><em>responsibility</em></strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""A horizontal timeline infographic titled “The Evolution of Human Work.” It shows five large coloured circles connected by a black arrow, each representing a stage of labor. Nomadic (Hunting): “Physical survival, hunt and gather.” Agricultural (Farming): “Tied to land and seasonal cycles.” Industrial (Factories): “From muscle to machine labour.” Information (Knowledge): “Brains over brawn: data and knowledge.” Deepware (Responsibility): “Execution shifts to responsibility and ethics.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ImgkXpy6k2_U53LUT5K7XQ.png"" /><figcaption>The evolution of work, from hunting to responsibility.</figcaption></figure><p>As <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Narayanan"">Arvind Narayanan</a> at Princeton observes, jobs are not monolithic entities. They are bundles of tasks. Some tasks are routine and susceptible to automation. Others require distinctly human qualities: judgement, ethics, accountability, wisdom.</p><p>The question is not whether AI can perform tasks. It demonstrably can, often better than we can. The question is who takes responsibility when those tasks produce consequences in the real world.</p><h3>Outputs are not outcomes</h3><p>This distinction matters more than most organisations realise.</p><p><strong>Output</strong> is what a process produces. Code. Copy. Designs. Legal briefs. Medical recommendations. Outputs are the tangible results of a system executing its programmed or prescribed function — the direct product of following steps, rules, or algorithms. The term emerged in the industrial era, literally describing the quantity of coal or iron a mine could extract in a given period. Output depends entirely on the efficiency and capability of the process that generates it.</p><p><strong>Outcome</strong> is what happens when that output meets reality. An outcome requires context, interpretation, application, and crucially — <em>intentionality</em>. Outcomes demand understanding not just what was produced, but why it matters, who it affects, and what consequences ripple from it. Where outputs measure productivity, outcomes measure impact. They are the ultimate change or consequence that results from applying an output with purpose and judgment.<br />AI can generate outputs. It cannot, however, create outcomes. Because outcomes require something <em>deepware</em> fundamentally lacks: the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetware_(brain)""><em>wetware</em></a> capacity for responsibility.</p><p>Computers cannot be held accountable, as IBM recognised in 1979. That truth has not changed. What has changed is our willingness to pretend otherwise.</p><figure><img alt=""IBM’s note stating: A computer can never be held accountable. Therefore a computer must never make a management decision."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*KxrF3PVHDs2TbLRh.png"" /><figcaption>IBM note, 1979</figcaption></figure><h3>The accountability vacuum</h3><p>We have already seen the cost of this pretension. A <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/06/03/attorneys-court-ai-hallucinations-judges/"">lawyer</a> in the US submitted AI-generated briefs filled with fabricated cases. A trial in <a href=""https://www.usnews.com/news/offbeat/articles/2025-08-15/australian-lawyer-apologizes-for-ai-generated-errors-in-murder-case"">Australia</a> was delayed because no one verified the AI’s outputs. These were not technological failures — these were failures of human responsibility.</p><p>When a professional says “the AI recommended it,” they are engaging in the same moral abdication as someone saying “I was just following orders.” Both statements attempt to transfer accountability to something — or someone — <a href=""https://emerge.digital/resources/ai-accountability-whos-responsible-when-ai-goes-wrong/"">incapable</a> of bearing it.</p><p>This is the dangerous seduction of <em>deepware</em>: it offers us the illusion that we can delegate not just tasks, but responsibility itself.</p><p>We cannot. We must not.</p><p>The future of work, then, is not about humans competing with AI for task execution. It is about humans stepping into roles where we exercise oversight, judgement, and accountability over the outputs that AI produces. This is not replacement. This is elevation.</p><p>But only if we prepare for it.</p><h3>The skills <em>deepware</em> cannot replicate</h3><p>Here is what the regulations already understand, even if organisations do not: responsible AI demands responsible humans. <br />The <a href=""https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai"">EU AI Act </a>mandates human oversight, transparency in decision-making, and clear accountability chains. Not as bureaucratic burden, but as fundamental safeguard.</p><p>Because here is the uncomfortable truth about <em>deepware</em>: it learns from historical data, which means it perpetuates historical biases.</p><p><a href=""https://www.cangrade.com/blog/hr-strategy/hiring-bias-gone-wrong-amazon-recruiting-case-study/"">Amazon’s</a> recruitment algorithm discriminated against women. <a href=""https://fairnow.ai/workday-lawsuit-resume-screening/"">Workday’s</a> hiring system did the same with 40+ candidates. <a href=""https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/even-a-small-typo-can-throw-off-ai-medical-advice-mit-study-says"">MIT</a> research found that AI healthcare systems told female patients they were more likely to “manage illness at home”. <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/search/can-you-review-this-article-an-G_Tc8IpkTOyF.Bj47m8IfQ"">Judicial</a> algorithms found Black defendants more culpable.</p><p>These are not glitches. These are features of systems trained on data that encoded decades of invisible discrimination.</p><p>So when we talk about the future of work, we are really talking about the future capacity of humans to think critically about the machines we build. To question their outputs. To interrogate their processes. To identify bias. To imagine consequences. To demand better.</p><p>This requires a different skill set entirely:</p><p><strong>Critical thinking: </strong>the ability to evaluate claims, identify assumptions, and distinguish correlation from causation.</p><p><strong>Systems thinking: </strong>understanding how components interact, how changes ripple, how second and third-order effects emerge.</p><p><strong>Lateral thinking: </strong>seeing connections across domains, applying insights from one context to another.</p><p><strong>Scenario planning: </strong>running mental simulations of possible futures, stress-testing decisions before implementation.</p><p><strong>Consequence thinking: </strong>asking not just “can we?” but “should we?” and “then what?”</p><p>Notice what these skills have in common. They are uniquely human. They require <em>wetware</em> that is fully engaged, not atrophied from disuse.</p><h3>The extension that could replace us</h3><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan"">Marshall McLuhan</a> wrote in 1967 that <em>“all technologies are extensions of our physical and nervous systems to increase power and speed.</em>” <br />The wheel extended our legs. The telescope extended our eyes. Now <em>deepware</em> extends our cognitive capacity.</p><p>But here is McLuhan’s warning, implicit in every page: when an extension becomes too powerful, we risk forgetting the limb it was meant to serve. We outsource function, and eventually, capability atrophies.</p><p>Consider the calculator. Brilliant tool. But an entire generation now cannot perform basic arithmetic without one. The extension has replaced the skill.</p><p>Now scale that to <em>deepware</em>. If we allow AI to think for us — to analyse, to recommend, to decide — without maintaining our own capacity to audit and override, we risk something far more dangerous than job loss. We risk becoming obsolete not because machines replaced us, but because we voluntarily stepped aside.</p><h3>The choice that defines the next era</h3><p>The future of work is not a future without humans. It is a future where humans do fundamentally different work: the <strong><em>work of being responsible</em></strong>.</p><p>This means verification before deployment. Critical thinking over speed. Systems thinking over isolated innovation. Accountability at every level.</p><p>It means training a generation not just to prompt AI, but to <em>interrogate</em> it. Not just to deploy models, but to <em>govern</em> them. Not just to consume outputs, but to construct meaningful <em>outcomes</em>.</p><p>It means recognising that as our <em>deepware</em> grows more sophisticated, our <em>wetware</em> must grow more rigorous. Every layer of AI we add demands an exponential increase in human oversight.</p><p>This is not optional. This is existential.</p><p>Mary Smith lost her job when the alarm clock arrived. But she did not lose her capacity for work — she adapted. Her children worked in offices, not on streets. Her grandchildren worked in roles she could never have imagined.</p><p>The same will be true for us, but only if we make a conscious choice: to remain conscious. To refuse the abdication of responsibility that <em>deepware</em> makes so seductively easy. To recognise that outcomes require human judgement in ways that outputs never will.</p><p>Our <em>wetware</em> remains the most sophisticated technology we possess. In the age of <em>deepware</em>, it is also the only thing preventing a future where machines own not just our code, but our agency.</p><p>The next time someone shows you what AI can do, we need to ask them something more important: who is responsible when it goes wrong?</p><p>Because in the end, the future of work depends not on what machines can produce, but on whether humans remember that we, and only we, can be held accountable for what happens next.</p><p><em>For a deeper exploration of the deepware-wetware framework and why responsible AI fundamentally depends on active human cognition, read: </em><a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/when-deepware-meets-wetware-the-uncomfortable-truth-about-responsible-ai-245842121749""><em>When Deepware meets Wetware: the uncomfortable truth about responsible AI</em></a></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a9293109b3be"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/when-machines-make-outputs-humans-must-own-outcomes-a9293109b3be"">When machines make outputs, humans must own outcomes</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4><em>How what we build transforms our condition and shapes the very fabric of meaning.</em></h4><figure><img alt=""A clear glass jar with a wide mouth and smooth, rounded edges is centered against a dark background, conveying simplicity and minimalism."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dj3PndoL2sZnFGwhjEPyuA.png"" /><figcaption>Image source: <a href=""https://www.freepik.com/premium-ai-image/empty-glass-jar-black-background_352966379.htm"">freepik.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>It should come as no surprise to those paying attention that <a href=""https://iep.utm.edu/nihilism/"">nihilism</a> — the belief that life lacks inherent meaning — has become <a href=""https://www.thefp.com/p/robin-westman-and-the-rise-of-american-nihilism-minneapolis-shooting"">increasingly prevalent</a>. However, these days it appears not as a defiant rejection of values, but as a quiet erosion of purpose met with a shrug of apathy.</p><p>Ends are replaced by metrics, conviction by convenience, and narrative by feeds. Secularism, politics, ideology, and technology are often blamed. However, another force hides in plain sight — design.</p><p>If one had to describe what nihilistic design looks like, it would be sterile, stripped of conviction, void of meaning, and soulless. Sound familiar?</p><p>Those same traits could be used to describe how many <a href=""https://www.thesecretdeveloper.com/blog/why-logos-are-gettingnbspboring"">brands</a>, <a href=""https://takt.com/articles/why-good-ux-is-making-websites-boring-and-how-to-fix-it/"">websites, and apps</a> appear today. No color, no texture, no shape— just flat, black and white, afraid to offend, and content to remain barren.</p><figure><img alt=""A collage of various webpage screenshots: OpenAI’s homepage, Google search, Facebook login, a social media platform, NVIDIA’s article, Apple products, Adidas shopping, and a fitness brand site."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8ublcl5lGeZitYR0XPuiUQ.png"" /><figcaption>Screen images of OpenAI, Google, Facebook, X, Nvidia, Apple, Adidas, and Nike.</figcaption></figure><p>We like to think design reflects culture. The <a href=""https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/the-baroque-style?srsltid=AfmBOorubuaM7Snv5M_p9U5B8ZpV5oc3rLu0axgNjmUbkj6KroOSsSFp"">ornament of the Baroque in the 17th century</a>, the geometric rigor of <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/art/Art-Deco"">Art Deco in the 1920s</a>, the <a href=""https://www.popbae.com/blogs/trends/summer-in-neon?srsltid=AfmBOoo9lDJUkloWIryj199z_wvnX_Gf1PVDfFYLcxG3u-m5OugoYfNF"">neon excess of the 1980s</a> — each seems like a mirror of the society that created it.</p><p>But what if this familiar story has it backwards? What if culture is not simply echoed in design, but shaped by it? What if the sterile and hollow interfaces we produce today are not passive reflections of nihilism, but active producers of it?</p><p>This idea has deep philosophical roots. <a href=""https://www.wilde-online.info/the-decay-of-lying-page15.html"">Oscar Wilde once argued that life imitates art</a> far more than art imitates life. <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-aesthetics/"">Friedrich Nietzsche believed that aesthetics precede truth,</a> that existence itself is justified only as an aesthetic phenomenon. <a href=""https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/mcluhan.mediummessage.pdf"">Marshall McLuhan declared that the medium is the message,</a> and <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/baudrillard/"">Jean Baudrillard pushed it further</a>, claiming that signs and images no longer reflect reality but generate it.</p><p>If this is true, the pattern is unmistakable—design doesn’t just record meaning, it scripts it. And once design withers, culture follows close behind.</p><h4>From story to feed</h4><p>Cultural forms once carried narrative. Cathedrals told stories in stone and glass. Novels and films offered beginnings, middles, and ends that gave coherence to life. Even broadcast television moved within familiar arcs.</p><figure><img alt=""Panoramic view of Paris at sunset, highlighting the golden dome of Les Invalides and the modern Montparnasse Tower amidst historic architecture. Warm, vibrant tones."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*yjxUVTkh6xVmKbl6sJcACg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Montparnasse and Les Invalides, Paris | Image source: <a href=""https://pixers.us/stickers/tour-montparnasse-and-les-invalides-paris-45670313"">pixers.us</a></figcaption></figure><p>Today that coherence is harder to find. Much can be said about the bland architecture of our cities and the thinning narratives of contemporary movies and novels, but one of the most concerning shifts has been in the evolution of streaming television.</p><p>Television experiences that once delivered episodes with self-contained stories now lean heavily on season-long arcs—<a href=""https://medium.com/a-suburban-prison/why-are-tv-shows-canceled-9b95db46a4a4""> arcs that may never conclude if the series is canceled</a>. Stories hang suspended, deferred, or abandoned, and audiences grow accustomed to living with open loops, each pause just another cue to crave the next dopamine hit that never truly satisfies.</p><p>Nowhere are open loops more pervasive than the internet, especially social media. Here, design has abandoned narrative architecture altogether. Scroll-based feeds deliver hours of endless, unresolved experience. Search itself has become infinite — every query spawning new links, new threads, new rabbit holes without finality. These systems do not merely reflect shortened attention spans—they train us into them.</p><p>What’s lost in this shift is the <a href=""https://medium.com/digital-media-society-spring-2020/the-impact-that-streaming-sites-have-on-society-ef45c37f2efe"">collective experience</a>. Once, cultural scarcity bound people together — shared stories, shared rituals, shared meanings that culminated. Meaning deepened because it was finite, because it felt resolved. Now we chase a superficial sense of significance in the infinite. But infinity never resolves. It offers no closure, only the perpetual lure of what lies just beyond.</p><h4>The myth of neutrality</h4><p>Minimalism and modernism complicate the story further. These movements, and their descendants in today’s flat digital interfaces, often parade as neutral. The grid, the sans serif, the clean white background — all claim to transcend culture, to present the universal. But neutrality is a myth. Every omission is a worldview.</p><p>By removing ornament, context, and symbol, design does not simply clear space for function — it establishes an aesthetic where emptiness itself becomes a virtue. This virtue is not neutral—it is rooted in Western Enlightenment ideals of rationality and order. A stripped-down interface tells us that depth is clutter, that meaning is noise, that efficiency is the highest good.</p><p>This unraveling of layered meaning now reaches even long-form writing. Articles like this, which should invite reflection, are met with readers possessed by the demand for expediency — brevity, punch, imagery. Platforms like Instagram and X (Twitter) have trained us to crave immediacy over depth. Pictures replace paragraphs, glances replace grasp, and culture learns to settle for surfaces.</p><h4>Reason without conviction</h4><p>What makes this drift even more insidious is the way design has cloaked itself in the language of reason. Research, usability testing, and A/B experiments all serve as proof that design is objective. Yet philosophy has long shown that reason cannot prove itself.</p><p>As <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/"">Immanual Kant</a> observed, reason always bumps against the limits of what it can justify. <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/"">David Hume</a> warned that no amount of empirical observation can bridge the gap from “is” to “ought.” <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel/"">Kurt Gödel</a> demonstrated that even mathematics, the purest structure of reason, contains truths that cannot be proven within its own system. And <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/"">Nietzsche</a> reminded us that what we take as “truth” often conceals underlying values and power.</p><p>When design insists that data is its foundation, it forgets that even data rests on faith — in our senses, our instruments, and our frameworks. What presents itself as objectivity quickly slides into <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/"">relativism</a>, guided not by conviction but by whichever metric performs best in an experiment. Meaning evaporates in the process. Usability without story, efficiency without soul — these become the hallmarks of design that has abandoned belief in meaning itself.</p><figure><img alt=""Cartoon of two men analyzing a dashboard with charts. A janitor nearby discards a paper. Caption reads, “Do we trust this data?” conveying skepticism."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/1*5niuoxNYCmrP5Fr_COXeGw.png"" /><figcaption>Illustration by <a href=""https://dataedo.com/cartoon/tag/trust-data"">Piotr Kononow</a></figcaption></figure><h4>AI and the acceleration of emptiness</h4><p>Artificial intelligence is the logical extension of this trajectory — an engine built on reason based technology—data, pattern recognition, statistical inference — yet stripped of the conviction or belief that gives form meaning.</p><p>An AI-generated logo may look polished, but beneath the surface there is nothing. It is statistically coherent but culturally vacant, a reflection of averages without values.</p><p>Scaled up, these outputs flood culture with forms that only pretend to carry meaning. The danger is not simply their hollowness, but the way they train us to accept hollowness as normal.</p><p>Worse, their conversational mimicry — the illusion of a voice that “understands” — <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/building-trust-in-opaque-systems-ce38cef741b6"">creates trust where none is warranted</a>. We begin to trust the simulation of meaning rather than meaning itself.</p><p>When design can be generated in seconds, we learn to value speed over depth, convenience over conviction. The more we consume forms without substance, the more we adapt to their vacancy.</p><p>AI doesn’t just produce empty surfaces — it trains us to stop expecting meaning at all. And that quiet erosion of expectation is what makes it an accelerant of nihilism.</p><h4>Design as an engine of nihilism</h4><p>In contemporary design the inversion becomes clear. It doesn’t merely display nihilism — it drives it. Infinite feeds manufacture distraction. Minimalist sameness recasts emptiness as elegance. AI systems hint at human replaceability and then condition us to accept it.</p><p>Today’s interfaces aren’t passive reflections of culture. They script the way we see, think, and value. In their hollow repetitions they embed a lesson— nothing lasts, everything is disposable, and meaning is irrelevant.</p><p>Once these forms take hold, culture completes the circuit. Users absorb the cues and stop expecting depth. The less story, symbolism, or conviction design provides, the more indulgent such elements appear when they do surface.</p><p>The loop accelerates until the pursuit of meaning seems archaic. Emptiness is marketed as efficiency, even clarity. And here lies the danger—nihilism does not remain an abstract idea but becomes a lived condition.</p><p>At that point design doesn’t follow culture — it steers it, training us not only to live without meaning but to stop wanting it. That is how nihilism, once a philosophical diagnosis, becomes the default atmosphere of everyday life. And sadly, we are in the midst of such decay.</p><h4>Toward a design of meaning</h4><p>If this diagnosis is right, then design carries more responsibility than we often admit. It is not neutral. It is not merely reactive. It is formative. Which means that if design has played a role in producing nihilism, it can also play a role in resisting it.</p><p>The challenge is not to restore some lost objectivity — that foundation never existed. The challenge is to create values where none are given. Nietzsche saw this as the only way through nihilism — to become creators of meaning rather than its mourners.</p><p><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kierkegaard/"">Søren Kierkegaard</a>, too, understood that escaping despair required more than reason—it demanded a leap of faith, an act of commitment that could not be justified in advance.</p><p>For design, that means reintroducing narrative into interfaces, reclaiming symbolism, and insisting that even in a secular and fragmented modern society, design can be an act of conviction rather than resignation. Meaning doesn’t emerge from an infinite feed of possibilities but from forms that resolve, gestures that culminate, and experiences that cohere.</p><p>Some designs already gesture in this direction. <a href=""https://duolingo-papers.s3.amazonaws.com/reports/Duolingo_whitepaper_duolingo_method_2023.pdf"">Duolingo, for example, transforms small units of repetition into a narrative of progress</a> — each lesson resolves, each milestone carries symbolic weight. It shows that interfaces need not be hollow loops of engagement, but can script arcs of meaning that accumulate over time.</p><figure><img alt=""“Left side: An orange flame and ‘5 day streak’ indicate practice consistency.

Every decision is ethical labyrinth. Every omission shapes culture. Every interface is an argument about how meaning works. If our designs are hollow, they will train us into hollowness. If they carry conviction, they will cultivate conviction.</p><h4>Choosing meaning</h4><p>We like to say design reflects culture, but that’s only half the truth. Culture also reflects design. And the interfaces we are building today don’t just echo nihilism — they embed it, normalize it, and accelerate it. The real question isn’t whether design has agency, but whether designers are willing to own the meanings they create — or the voids they leave behind.</p><p>Part of the work is rhetorical. Designers can <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/rhetorical-triangle/"">learn to reframe meaning</a> as a kind of metric in itself — arguing that coherence builds retention, that conviction breeds loyalty. If the industry only speaks numbers, then one task is to translate values into that language without losing the values themselves.</p><p>If we refuse that responsibility, our interfaces will go on teaching the same lesson, swipe after swipe—that meaning itself is negotiable, optional, disposable. And the more we live inside those lessons, the more we risk losing the very capacity to imagine life beyond the abyss.</p><p><strong><em>Don’t miss out! </em></strong><a href=""https://micbuckcreative.medium.com/subscribe""><strong><em>Join my email list</em></strong></a><strong><em> and receive the latest content.</em></strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4b8617293462"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/contemporary-design-doesnt-just-reflect-nihilism-it-creates-it-4b8617293462"">Contemporary design doesn’t just reflect nihilism, it creates it.</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Just look at how massive <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hunger-games"">The Hunger Games</a></em> and <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/twilight-renaissance"">Twilight</a></em> became, with <em>Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping</em> due to land in 2026. Ahead, here are all the book-to-screen adaptations that will be released in 2025. <figure><figcaption><h2>The Lost Bus<br /></h2><br /><em>The Lost Bus</em> is based on <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"">Lizzie Johnson's 2021 book <em>Paradise: One Town's Struggle to Survive an American Wildfire</em>.

It follows the Nuremberg trials, held by the Allies in the aftermath of World War II and saw Nazi Germany leaders on trial for war crimes. <em>Nuremberg </em>follows chief psychiatrist Douglas Kelley as he interviews Nazi military members to see if they are fit to stand trial, including Adolf Hitler's close accomplice, Hermann Göring.<br /><br /><em><strong>Nuremberg </strong></em><strong>will be released in theaters on November 7, 2025<br /></strong> </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Running Man<br /></h2><br />Stephen King is back for yet another book-to-screen adaptation, this time starring Glen Powell, William H Macy, Colman Domingo, Emilia Jones, Josh Brolin and Michael Cera.

Her best friend Glinda Upland (Ariana Grande) has been given the new title of Glinda the Good, and is the Wizard (Geff Goldblum) and Madam Morrible's (Michelle Yeoh) puppet.

<p>Now that <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/09/11934126/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-ending"">The Summer I Turned Pretty</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/09/11934126/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-ending""> Season 3 has wrapped up</a>, it feels like there’s a hole in our hearts. Instead of spending our Wednesday nights with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-conrad-jeremiah"">Conrad Fisher</a> and Belly Conklin, we’re impatiently waiting for <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-movie"">The Summer I Turned Pretty </a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-movie"">movie</a> to come our way. It’s disappointing to lose yet another <em>escape-the-world</em> show, where the messy universe of Cousins Beach and cheating scandals could take your mind off life admin and grown-up problems. Luckily, there are a plethora of other shows to fill the gap — whether you’re after more teenage angst, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/book-to-tv-movies-adaptations-2025"">book-to-screen adaptations</a>, or even another series about a girl torn between two brothers.</p>



<p>From other YA series to classics that still hold up today, here are 9 shows like <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em> to add to your watchlist. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>My Life with the Walter Boys</em></h2>







<p>Lovingly dubbed the “yeehaw version” of <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em> by fans, Netflix’s take on the brother-love-triangle trope is just as addictive as <em>TSITP</em>. Based on a YA Wattpad novel by Ali Novak, it follows recently orphaned teen Jackie (Nikki Rodriguez). After moving from the big city to a country ranch in Colorado, she begins to adjust to life with her mother’s friend and her 11 children. She begins to have feelings for brothers Cole Walter and Alex Walter at the same time, leading to turmoil and angst. </p>



<p><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Netflix</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>XO, Kitty</em></h2>







<p>From the mind of Jenny Han, creator and writer of <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em>, comes an original spinoff from her <em>To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before </em>trilogy. Following Lara Jean’s (Lana Condor) younger sister Kitty Covey (Anna Cathcart) as she settles into boarding school in Seoul, South Korea, this show provides the perfect mix of K-Drama and what we all loved from the <em>TATBILB </em>movies.</p>



<p><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Netflix</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>Outer Banks</em></h2>







<p><em>Outer Banks (OBX)</em> is one of Netflix’s biggest hits, with four seasons already on the streaming platform. If you’re looking for a beachy vibe like <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em>, add this to your watchlist. </p>



<p>It follows a group of friends in North Carolina on a treasure hunt tied to John B’s (Chase Stokes) father. Expect car crashes, characters being stuck on desert islands, murder and other dramatic storylines.</p>



<p><strong>Where to watch: </strong> Netflix</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>One Tree Hill</em></h2>







<p>If you’re craving love triangles involving brothers, we’ve got another one for you. <em>One Tree Hill</em> follows half-brothers Lucas (Chad Michael Murray) and Nathan Scott (James Lafferty) as fierce basketball rivals, who are also after the same romantic interest, Peyton Sawyer (Hilarie Burton). This show has some of the most heartwrenching cliffhangers and horrifying storylines for a teen drama in history, so if you want to go on a wild ride, add this to your watchlist.</p>



<p><strong>Where to watch: </strong>HBO Max</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>Heartstopper</em></h2>







<p>Another book-to-screen adaptation, <em>Heartstopper</em> captured, well, our hearts when it landed on Netflix. Following a teen romance between Charlie Spring (Joe Locke) and Nick Nelson (Kit Connor), Season 1 and 3 boast a perfect score of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. Like <em>TSITP</em>, the series will conclude with a feature film titled <em>Heartstopper Forever</em>. </p>



<p><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Netflix</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>Dawson’s Creek</em></h2>







<p><em>Dawson’s Creek</em> is the OG teen series, which paved the way for love triangles, angst and drama. Fans have consistently compared Belly’s love triangle with Conrad and Jeremiah to the messy relationships between Dawson, Joey and Pacey. </p>



<p><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Hulu</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>We Were Liars</em></h2>







<p>Prime Video’s newest book-to-screen adaptation hit our screens in June this year, and it’s gripping from beginning to end. Starring Aussie Joseph Zada — who’s leading <em>The Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping</em> — and <em>One Tree Hill’s</em> Barbara Alyn Woods’ daughter Emily Alyn Lind, this mystery thriller will keep you on your toes. It follows Lind’s character Cadence Sinclair, after an amnesia-causing accident, as she tries to piece together what happened last summer. </p>



<p><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Prime Video</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>One Day</em></h2>







<p>If you thought Belly and Conrad’s slow-burning relationship spanning five years was agony, <em>One Day</em> focuses on a relationship between Emma (Ambika Mod) and Dexter (Leo Woodall) across 14 years. Playing heavily into the <em>will they, won’t they</em> trope, <em>One Day </em>is both infuriating and romantic, and could very well have you in tears by the end. </p>



<p><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Netflix</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>Never Have I Ever</em></h2>







<p>Mindy Kaling’s original show <em>Never Have I Ever</em> tackles many of the same themes as <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em>. Exploring grief, finding yourself, love and more, Devi Vishwakumar (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) is the heart of this show — much like Belly. Plus, Devi finds herself in an impossible love triangle between her fierce rival Ben (Jaren Lewison) and the hottest boy in school Paxton (Darren Barnet), with hijinks along the way.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936090.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /><figcaption>Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As the famous saying goes, “Don’t just dream it, be it!” This expression rings true during October 6’s Super Full Harvest Moon in Aries. This rioting lunation brings us back to ourselves and helps us redefine our lives. We hold the power to become the person we are meant to be by<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/yearly-horoscope-2025""> transforming the way we view ourselves</a>. Without drama or fear, we are ready to spark our hearts and embrace ourselves with compassion and kindness. When we look in the mirror, we’ll adore the person we see. We hold the key to this amazing state of mind and glory. <br /><br />A supermoon occurs when the Moon is at perigee to Earth. You may be scratching your head, trying to figure out what the astronomical term means. I’m gonna save you a trip to Google and explain. Simply put: The Moon is closer to Earth than usual, making it appear larger than normal. So, if you’re looking at the night sky and thinking about why the Full Moon is bigger and brighter, it just means it is in a closer orbit to our planet. However, note that the emotional effects of the lunation might hit hard. This season has three supermoons: October 6, November 5, and December 4. </p>



<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/super-harvest-moon-in-aries-horoscope-september-2023"">Harvest Moon</a> is the Full Moon that occurs closest to the Fall Equinox (which was on September 22). This lunation is a time for farmers to secure their bounty and crops as we transition toward the year’s colder months. Spiritually, the Harvest Moon offers celebration, abundance, and blessings. We thank the Earth for its bounty and beauty before heading into the darker days. The Super Full Harvest Moon provides us with a moment of reflection and gratitude, in which we can move towards our inner cravings by balancing out our emotions. It’s a glorious time — no wonder Neil Young’s been crooning about this lunar glow-up for decades.<br /><br />The day of the Harvest Moon has a lot going on, astrologically. For starters, the communication planet, Mercury, dives into Scorpio. Mercury in Scorpio likes to have meaningful and intense discussions. This Mercurial placement is often suspicious of others, leading us to proceed cautiously when trusting others. Our passions will be ignited, even if we have trouble discussing them, as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/water-signs-zodiac-traits-explained"">the water sign</a> is less conversational and more intuitive.  We’ll lean into our emotions and gut feelings — especially when Mercury creates a minor frustration with Neptune retrograde in Aries. If something is off, listen to the voice within and move away from it.</p>



<p>Uranus retrograde in Gemini shares a gentle aspect with the North Node of Destiny, making us run away from the mundane and embrace change. Uranus is walking us up from the daze and haze we’ve been under, allowing us to revolutionize our personal philosophies about how we live and spend our time. We want to seek excitement and joy at all costs by throwing caution to the wind. Be careful not to get too reckless and impetuous because we may regret our decisions later and blame the Moon for our actions. </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/asteroids-astrology-horoscopes-meaning"">The asteroid Ceres</a> (which represents nurturing and TLC) links up with the Moon in Aries, urging us to put self-care and self-love at the top of our priorities. Focus on ventures that make you happy, even if they don’t align with the status quo. Revel in the company of people who challenge your ideology and offer new concepts. Live boldly and greatly — most importantly, unapologetically! <br /><br />The takeaway from the Super Full Harvest Moon in Aries is that we should exist on our own terms. Those who wish to silence us aren’t the people we need to surround us. We can create the dynamics we want and never settle for anything less than what our hearts deserve and desire. The energy will be high, pushing us to rush through our choices and jump into the next best thing or person that catches our fancy. However, it is advisable to watch matters unfold.  March to the beat of your own drum and embrace the most authentic versions of yourself. Cheers to that!</p>

<p>If epic pop culture moments like <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/barbie-brand-collaborations-2023"">Barbie</a></em> and <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-season-3-fashion-collaborations"">The Summer I Turned Pretty</a> </em>have taught us anything, it’s that a timely, well-executed collab can work wonders to transport and immerse viewers into the world of their favorite big- and small-screen characters. And if last year’s countless <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wicked-movie-brand-collaborations"">Wicked</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wicked-movie-brand-collaborations""> brand collections</a> are any indication, we’re gearing up for another season of green and pink everything with the forthcoming release of <em>Wicked: For Good</em>. And naturally, we can’t begin to talk about <em>Wicked </em>collections without mentioning Ariana Grande’s own makeup brand, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/04/10946075/ariana-grande-rem-beauty-ulta"">r.e.m. Beauty</a>.</p>



<p>If you, like me, have been voraciously consuming every morsel of <em>For Good</em> content as the November premiere date approaches, prepare yourselves; <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/featured/rembeauty_art2_wicked25"">r.e.m. Beauty x </a><em><a href=""https://www.ulta.com/featured/rembeauty_art2_wicked25"">Wicked: For Good</a> </em>is the ultimate beauty collection for you to <em>obsessulate</em> over. The <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/featured/rembeauty_art2_wicked25"">limited-edition capsule</a> features nine products, spanning blush trios, plumping lip glosses, metallic eyeliners inspired by the Emerald City, and a very special 12-pan eyeshadow palette inspired by the Ozian Forest — a locale that’s featured prominently in the sequel. Also noteworthy: Two makeup sets inspired by <em>For Good</em>‘s leading ladies, Glinda and Elphaba, with four full-size products each. </p>





<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936079.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>I personally consider myself a Glinda rising, Elphaba sun, and Nessarose moon, so I immediately gravitated towards the moody, earthy tones in the <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/elphaba-makeup-set-pimprod2054985?sku=2645275"">Elphaba Makeup Set</a> and the <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/elphaba-makeup-set-pimprod2054985?sku=2645275"">Ozian Forest Eyeshadow Palette</a>. For an everyday fall look, I used a couple matte neutral shades from the palette — a pale beige called “Confusifying,” “Witching Hour” (a warm tan), and “The Grimmerie” (a milk chocolate) in the crease. Then, I applied a plummy lip &amp; cheek tint from the Elphaba set (the shade is “Braverism,” which…love) as a lipstick and blush, and added the glossy balm in the shade Wickedness (a sheer brown with golden-magenta micro glitter) to round out the lip combo. I already happened to be wearing a green cardigan and my hair in a long braid, which totally brought the Elphaba vibes to life.</p>



<p>Another favorite from the collection is the greenish-gold “Elphie” shade of the <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/starlet-liquid-eyeshadow-pimprod2051262?sku=2637766"">Starlet liquid eyeshadows</a> (my all-time favorite product by the brand), worn underneath the gold metallic shade (“All Roads Lead To The Wizard”) from the Ozian Forest palette, paired with curled lashes and mascara for a statement eye look. </p>





<p>I was already a fan of r.e.m. Beauty, but if you haven’t yet tried the brand, I for one can’t think of a better time to get acquainted than now. You can already shop the full <em><a href=""https://www.ulta.com/featured/rembeauty_art2_wicked25"">Wicked: For Good</a></em><a href=""https://www.ulta.com/featured/rembeauty_art2_wicked25"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""> collection</a> on <a href=""https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/lfYFCBB7E0flV3rwtzfnt2ZwHP?domain=rembeauty.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">rembeauty.com</a>, and at Ulta Beauty stores and <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/featured/rembeauty_art2_wicked25"">online</a> on October 5. As for me? I’m already planning my premiere look…</p>

If we've learnt anything from Ginnifier Goodwin, Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis movies<em>,</em> it's that the ""friends to lovers"" cliché is part of the golden trio of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/diversity-representation-rom-coms-lily-chu"">rom-com love stories</a>. Next to the ""enemies to lovers"" trope, and the ""random strangers brought together by fate"" story arc, of course.<br /><br />Making your friend a lover can certainly seem very appealing. There's the satisfaction you'd feel after your friend <em>finally</em> turns around to look at you like<em> that</em>. You've already established closeness and intimacy, and the release of any sexual tension that's been building up for who knows how long can be a relief. It's romantic, confidence-boosting and sexy — and it certainly makes for a really great story.<br /><br />But is it just that — a story? Does getting <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/should-you-date-friend"">romantically involved with a friend</a> really work in real life? While some people say that going from friends to something more creates an unbreakable foundation for a romantic relationship, others believe in the age-old concern that doing so might <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/02/11668705/friendship-breakdown-vacation-travel"">ruin the friendship</a> — and that's more important than anything else. <br /><br /><em>Refinery29 </em>spoke to 10 women about their experiences of going from friends to lovers, and what they learnt about love, sex and friendship along the way.<figure><figcaption><h2>Anwyn (she/they), 23<br /></h2><br />""As a theatre and English literature major, I am absolutely in love with the friends-to-lovers trope. It’s been every <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/situationships-dating-fulfilling-2"">example of a relationship, situationship</a>, crush and friends with benefits that I’ve ever had. I think I love it for many reasons, including that you can trust that person more easily, you know they preemptively already care about you and respect your dignity/autonomy, and also because you see them regularly and are often in social spaces with them.<br /><br />""Whilst it’s been good in that I’ve been able to retain the friendships with these people despite how it ends and love all the individuals deeply as mates, I’m also left feeling really sad because it didn’t eventuate into more of a serious or romantic connection. Because, at a certain point, the other person calls it [off] because they don’t want to lose our friendship, or I myself do the same.<br /><br />""Recently, I heard some wise words from one of my best friends who told me that maybe my love for this trope isn’t actually the best way for me to be navigating love and sex. Maybe instead, I should try going for people who don’t see me just as a friend, first and foremost. It’s pretty hard in reality for friends to lovers to work because friendships are equally as important as lovers, and the boundary between them is more critical than I previously thought.""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Bella (she/her), 23<br /></h2><br />""We were friends before we ever started dating, but he always felt like home to me. I always knew he loved me, but it took me a second to realise that I felt the same. As a teenager, I hadn’t learnt to associate those feelings — of safety and wanting to be with him all the time — with love. The moment I realized this was when he was driving me home one night. He was telling me about the time he broke his arm, and his dad drove him to the hospital. I had this distinct moment where I realized I didn’t want to miss him breaking a bone ever again. I wanted to be there for all of it — highs and lows. <br /><br />""The beautiful thing about going from friends to lovers is even when you’re lovers, you’re still friends. You still want to hang out with them, hear from them, trust them, and believe in them. In my opinion, it’s the best way to do it. Something hard, though, is that over time, it’s easy to fall back into a habit of just being best friends — and you have to work hard to keep up the intimacy of lovers. But it’s a pretty lovely default to fall back on. Could definitely be worse. ""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Sabrina (she/her), 24<br /></h2><br />""It all started happening very slowly. We were already good friends, but we started hanging out every day and, often, I would end up sleeping over because I didn't want to go home to face some things I was dealing with. It was all very gradual. It was a platonic sleepover to start, but over time, we would just inch a bit closer, and then all of a sudden we were secretly sleeping together. I never meant to fall for him. I didn't really think it would happen because I had a very 'I don't want to be in a relationship' mentality at the time. It was fun keeping it a secret, sneaking around. <br /><br />""Then, all of a sudden it had almost been a year, and I was still confused about what I was feeling. He told me he loved me, but just 'not like that'. He actually hooked up with someone else soon after this. All of a sudden, I was left picking up the pieces of my broken heart while trying to navigate what I was feeling. Our friends still didn't know about us, and I had to listen to everyone talk about him and this new girl; it was so painful, and I still feel the mental health repercussions of it to this day. Now, even though he's still around <em>a lot</em>, I'm trying hard to make sure there's some more distance and boundaries between us.""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Laura (she/her), 25<br /></h2><br />""I've been a little bit in love with one of my good friends for as long as I've known them. Not enough to distract me from dating other people or being interested in others, but it's always just lingering there in the background. The 'what if', the possibility — isn't that what makes all friend-to-lover experiences that little bit more exciting? It's often been a matter of timing. Whenever I'm in a relationship, she's not, and vice versa. But we've recently both become single and we've been playfully considering giving it a go.<br /><br />""It's a bit weird because you often have to be a lot franker with a friend if you want something more, instead of that subtle insinuation you have with someone who is already a dating prospect from the start. We've giggled and fumbled a lot as we try to work it out, and every now and then, I'm struck with a fear that we'll mess it all up. Sometimes I think if it was meant to happen it would have ages ago. But I guess we'll see.""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Siobhan (she/her), 27<br /></h2><br />""Trying to go from friends to lovers was one of the worst ideas I've ever had. It was just one of those situations where everything that made us good friends made us bad lovers. The way we used to playfully bicker and tease each other became actual fights. Going to the same parties and events every single week became frustrating instead of fun. What I learnt is that just because you might have sexual tension with someone, does <em>not </em>mean you'll work, or that you should actually pursue them. Sexual tension between friends is almost always gonna be there on some level if you're interested in each other's sex or gender, but more often than not, it's actually meant to just stay platonic.""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Tam (she/her), 25<br /></h2><br />""I’ve known my current partner for 20 years now. We met in the first year of primary school and drifted in and out of friend circles for years. Towards the end of high school, she came into my close friend group as she was dating a best friend of mine. They broke up near graduation, and when <em>we</em> started seeing each other in 2020, things were pretty difficult, seeing as there was that history amongst my friend group. It was quite on and off at the start, and it was even harder for us to have space from each other when we decided to take a break, as we were still in the same friend group. Since the start of 2020, everyone has become much more comfortable with it and we officially started dating — and things have been great ever since. Although, it is tough to have space and do my own thing sometimes as we're always hanging out...!""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Sara (she/her), 26<br /></h2><br />""I was <em>that </em>girl who didn't realise she liked her friend as more than a friend until he got into a serious relationship with someone else. There were many months of pining, tears and jealousy until they split (I swear I had nothing to do with it), and after a while, I decided to shoot my shot. We honestly had a great time together as more than friends. I can count it as one of the better relationships I've ever had. But it ultimately just didn't work — I don't know if it was because we were friends first or if it just wasn't meant to be, but it wasn't right. <br /><br />""I sometimes think I only sparked my attraction to him <em>because </em>he had become off-limits, and I wonder if it still would've happened if things had been different. I'm not a friends with your ex kind of girl, so no, we're not friends anymore. But I'm honestly okay with that. I think people come in and out of your life for different reasons and in different roles. Our time was just up (in more ways than one) but I'm ultimately grateful for the experience.""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Liv (she/her), 24<br /></h2><br />""Despite everyone<em> </em>in our lives suggesting we get together for so many years, we just didn't see it at the time. We had kissed once when we were teenagers but happily left it at that for almost a decade. We fell in love with other people over the years and just lived our lives as friends. I can't even describe how it happened, honestly. One day, when we were finally both single, we just turned around and saw it.<br /><br />""And I thank <em>God </em>that we were friends first. Not only is it just a great story with a really satisfying ending, but we've been communicating for so many years that we're really good at it now. He understands my history and my patterns <em>super </em>well without needing an explanation. I will say that it can be sad not to feel like we're really learning anything new about each other the way other couples might, and we fell into serious marriage-like couple status pretty quickly, so we didn't get that spark-filled stage as much. But we got the ultimate end result and I'm so fine with that.""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Amelia (she/her), 29<br /></h2><br />""My friend and I gave it a go romantically a few years ago, but it didn't end up working out. We'd both felt <em>so </em>much pressure from our friends to get together because we work well in so many ways. We partly got together because we were just curious to see what it would be like, and also because we just wanted everyone to leave us alone! But as is the way in any relationship (I think, especially when you're friends first), don't just get together with someone simply because it seems like a good idea to everyone else. Your relationships aren't meant to only please other people. Luckily, we're still friends now (though we had to take a year-long hiatus after our fling ended to give each other some space), but it could've gone much worse. While I don't regret it, I wouldn't do it again.""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Brie (she/her), 36<br /></h2><br />""I was friends with my partner for a couple of years before I realized that, actually, I wanted more than friendship. So I told him that and asked him out! We were not super close friends — we followed each other on socials and occasionally chatted there and caught up for drinks or dinner. I think our not being super close is what made the move from pals to partners easier. The hardest part was needing to adjust my perspective of him as I got to know him more intimately. Some of that was surprising but mostly it was great. We’ll celebrate four years together later this year, so I think it's fair to say things went pretty well!""</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Nikki (she/her), 25</h2><br />""We've been friends since we were five years old. As we got older, we started having on-and-off flings over the years. I always thought, even before we were dating, that we were twin flames. We started sleeping together during COVID lockdowns, but I never thought I would end up with him. I never thought I was actually interested, but we caught feelings fast. It was a difficult transition because we had been friends for so long, and were cautious of ruining it and how it may affect our friends (as we're in the same friend group).<br /><br />""It was difficult because we knew we wanted to be with each other but also that it would be a serious commitment to each other because of our history. But, we made it work. Our love now is super intense and super passionate. It’s a deep love that is built on strong foundations of knowledge and understanding. I’ve never loved anyone this much. Complete and utter devotion. I am so thankful and grateful for it.""</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?</strong></p>",

Living in Orlando, it doesn’t really start to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fall-2025-fashion-beauty-trends-forecast""><em>feel</em> like fall</a> until the season’s already over and winter sets in, if we’re lucky. The crispy air, crunchy leaves, and sweater weather are more of a Pinterest board dream than a Florida reality.<br /><br />But Southern folks have our ways of faking fall: visiting pumpkin patches in 85-degree heat, weekend camping trips, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2014/10/76621/hocus-pocus""><em>Hocus Pocus</em></a><em> </em>movie nights with the electric fireplace crackling, and scares at Universal’s Halloween Horror Nights.<br /><br />Still, nothing tricks us into the spirit of autumn quite like scent. The smell of spiced apples and burnt sugar sends us right into an episode of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/11/129035/gilmore-girls-rewatching-show-new-opinion-love-hate""><em>Gilmore Girls</em></a>, even if we’re in shorts. That’s probably why candle sales spike in the fall. According to the National Candle Association, more than <a href=""https://candles.org/facts-figures-2/"">35% of candle sales</a> happen in the fourth quarter, with many candle brands beginning to see major increases in September. <br /><br />Scent is the strongest sense tied to memory. So fall candles do more than smell good — they transport us. Aromas like pumpkin chai or caramel pecan take us to a cozy kitchen filled with baked goods and warm mugs, while woodsy notes like cedar, amber, or smoke pull us into forests or bonfires.<br /><br />Whether you’re embracing crisp autumn changes or creating your own version of the season, these Latine-owned candles will help set the scene and the scent.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

<p>I have to confess: I’m not a World Cup fan. Or a soccer fan. Or any kind of sports fan, for that matter. But my fiancé is something of a fanatic. He’s an avid supporter, follower, watcher, cheerer of the World Cup, and even though we’re still about a year out from the biggest soccer event in the world, he’s already talking about it, incessantly and fervently — so much so that I now can’t help but be swept up in his enthusiasm. It’s utterly palpable. </p>



<p>So, here’s what I’ve learned: The FIFA World Cup 26<sup>TM</sup> is <em>a really big deal, </em>because not only will it be the largest, with 48 participating teams, but it’s heading stateside. For the first time ever, the World Cup is being co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico. That means, over the course of a month (from June 11 to July 19, 2026), the tournament will span North America, kicking off in Mexico City, with matches being played in major cities, like Los Angeles, Miami, and Toronto, before culminating in the final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936105.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>That also<em> </em>means, for U.S. folks, we can tune in to watch at an appropriate time — and not, say, forced to wake up at the crack of dawn, all groggy and bleary-eyed, to catch a 5 a.m. match — because we’re physically close in proximity to the action. </p>



<p>Luckily for my fiancé and myself, I don’t have to stress over securing tickets, because <a href=""https://verizon.com/FIFA"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Verizon</a> is launching Verizon Ultimate Access and partnering with David Beckham to reward its customers with thousands of free tickets to every match, including the final(!). Also, Verizon is making it possible for us to get <em>even closer</em> to the action by offering select “Golden Tickets,” Willy Wonka-style, for unprecedented, once-in-a-lifetime pitchside access — a space traditionally, exclusively reserved for players and coaches (my fiancé would <em>freak</em>).  </p>



<p>It’s not just tickets either. Through Ultimate Access, there will be opportunities for customers to partake in unique experiences: on-the-ground activations, giveaways, player meet-and-greets (Verizon has teamed up with a roster of legends like Tim Howard and Chucky Lozano), special events, and more. </p>



<p>I’m told that World Cup tickets are nearly impossible to get (akin to winning the lottery), which is why it’s important to set your alarms, pencil it in your calendar, do whatever you need to do, because free tickets are available starting October 2 through the <a href=""https://www.verizon.com/solutions-and-services/my-verizon-mobile/"">My Verizon app</a> (more dates will be announced on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/verizon/?hl=en"">social media</a>).

<p>Head to TikTok and you’ll find plenty of excellent relationship advice, but spend too much time in the hashtags <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/tag/relationshipadvice?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">#relationshipadvice </a>and <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/tag/relationshipgoals?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">#relationshipgoals</a>, you’ll discover a plethora of questionable stuff, too. The quick-fire nature of the social media platform doesn’t exactly allow for nuance, and one recent video that threw me for a loop was about getting comfortable in a relationship.</p>



<p>I can’t remember the creator because I swiped past it so fast I almost burned my fingertips. But basically, it was saying “if you’re comfortable, you’re bored and need to leave”. I panicked — I’ve been with my partner for almost two years now, my longest relationship. I don’t even feel like we had a super <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/5-relationship-stages"">intense honeymoon period </a>— I liked him, he liked me, we started seeing each other more and more. We moved in together, got a dog. Sure, for the first few months we were a bit love-drunk, but that settled into comfortable ease fairly quickly. It’s great. It’s chill. It’s nice.</p>



<p>I’m an anxious gal and a lot of my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/dating-anxious-avoidant-attachment-style-switch"">anxiety has centered on relationships</a>. I critique <em>everything</em>. Is my partner right for me. Am I really in love. Do we have enough sex. Whatever my brain can fixate on, I’ll go there — so this TikTok was confronting. Was my relationship <em>too easy</em>? Had we lost our spark, or even had it in the first place? I got stuck in the vortex of TikTok couples dancing around fields of daisies and making out furiously in front of renovated campervans. Captions like “every day is a new adventure with you” abounded. Anxious? I was positively beside myself at this point.</p>



<p>“Feeling comfortable is necessary to develop healthy relationships,” says psychologist Kayla Steele. “To be comfortable in a relationship suggests that you have developed a level of attachment security, which is essential for your physical and emotional wellbeing.”</p>



<p>Speaking to Steele, I realized that a lot of my anxiety was fuelled by comfort being a new experience. Prior to my partner Tom, I had a string of short-term romances that either felt one-sided (my side, ofc) or ended abruptly. None lasted longer than four months, which meant that I never settled into an actual relationship, even if I was calling the guy my boyfriend.</p>



<p>In those early periods, I was on edge — I may have been infatuated, but I didn’t have any security. This lack of security may have felt like excitement, but actually, I was just flying through the air without a safety net. Every time, I crashed.</p>



<p>“Being comfortable or settled in a relationship means that you are able to trust your partner and yourself, and this lays the foundation for vulnerability and intimacy,” explains Steele. I feel this — my relationship might be predictable and drama-free, but the safety cocoon this gives us allows for deeper connection. “For people whose relationships have been marked by insecurity, turbulence, or volatility, feeling at peace can be uncomfortable or even threatening,” explains Steele. </p>



<p>Beneath the thrill of my past relationships was fear — and actually, I never developed much of a closeness to those partners because I didn’t feel safe enough to do so.</p>



<p>Feeling settled in a relationship is actually a place of peace, not boredom. The world barrages us with stimulation at all times — apps, social media, TV, radio — there’s always something in our ears or eyes, and that’s made us uncomfortable with just <em>being</em>. But without relaxing into a relationship, you can’t cultivate true intimacy. Without intimacy, you never get past the surface.</p>



<p>Hollywood kicked off this addiction to thrills — angst, yearning, passion, can’t-live-without-you fire. But social media has taken it and positioned it as a lived experience. Now, we compare our love stories to random people on Instagram or TikTok, and because the nature of these platforms is that simple and shareable equals maximum reach, what we get is binary thinking presented as fact. Life is way more nuanced than “if you’re settled, you’re settling” or “if you’re comfortable, you’re bored”. </p>



<p>Is it any wonder we’re feeling anxious when our relationships are actually at their healthiest? </p>



<p>Still, there is such a thing as a comfort rut. There is a difference between comfort and complacency. “Complacency in relationships is a feeling of being satisfied with the current state of your relationship, without thinking critically or indeed having awareness of how others may be feeling,” says Steele. “When you are complacent in your relationship, you may feel like you do not need to put in effort, and this can lead to dissatisfaction, frustration or even the breakdown of relationships.”</p>



<p>I’m finding this a fine line to walk because it is <em>so</em> easy to take my healthy relationship for granted. Finding comfort and finally enjoying it is like wrapping yourself in a warm blanket. But when my partner and I don’t check in on a regular basis, we find ourselves becoming roomates, not lovers.</p>



<p>“Relationships need a healthy balance of comfort (or security) and exploration (or play),” says Steele. I’m now trying to balance our natural routine, which I really love by the way, with introducing new experiences. That might be going on dates mid-week, making travel plans (even if it’s just a weekend away) – even switching up our daily walks with our dog can snap us out of going through the motions.</p>



<p>It’s also making sure we physically interact — hugging when one of us gets home, kissing each other goodnight, snuggling on the couch. All of this romantic touch keeps the spark alive, I’ve found. Weeks when we go through the motions are weeks when I start to feel disconnected.</p>



<p>But this is just a life problem, not a relationship one. Even when I was single I had to mix up my routine or I would find myself feeling bored and aimless. It’s strange that we put romantic relationships up on an impossibly high pedestal, to the point where the natural complexities of life become Big Problems when in any other relationship or within our own independent experiences, they’re just accepted. There is literally no part of life that doesn’t need a jumpstart every now and then, so why do we expect relationships to maintain the energy they have at the beginning?</p>



<p>I truly believe the reason we fixate on comfort and routine in relationships is because we’ve been conditioned to believe love is meant to be turbulent and drive all the excitement in our lives. It’s not. Love is supposed to be supportive. A truly healthy relationship is one you feel safe in, because <em>then</em> you have the support you need to take leaps into vulnerable places. </p>



<p>I’ve realized that I am responsible for making my life exciting, and that excitement isn’t meant to come from long-term love, at least not constantly. I can share exciting moments with my partner and I definitely notice that our story has waves — we might hit a complacency patch, but then we’ll have a great night out or someone has a life win and the relationship energy changes again. </p>



<p>Honestly, life is so chaotic. It’s actually the best experience ever to have a constant, calming love story at the centre of it.</p>

<p><em>Welcome to</em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/money-diary""><em> </em>Money Diaries</a><em> where we are tackling the ever-present taboo that is money. We’re asking real people how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period — and we’re tracking every last dollar.</em><br /><br /><em>Today: a freelance writer and visual merchandiser who has a $150,000 joint income and who spends some of her money this week on a chai latte (and was pleasantly surprised at the spice level).</em><br /><br /><strong><em>Editor’s Note: </em></strong><em>This is a follow-up diary. You can read the original diary </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-copywriter-victoria-british-columbia-salary-money-diary""><em>here</em></a><em>. Prices are listed in Canadian dollars. </em></p>



<p><strong>Job Title: </strong>Freelance writer/visual merchandiser<br /><strong>Industry: </strong>Fashion/retail<br /><strong>Age: </strong>32<br /><strong>Location:</strong> Victoria, BC, Canada<br /><strong>Pronouns</strong>: She/her <br /><strong>Annual Salary</strong>: $50,000<br /><strong>Household Income/Financial Setup:</strong> $150,000. My husband J. and I split our finances in the sense that we have separate accounts to build up our individual credit scores, but we send money between the accounts as needed. It’s an “our money” versus “your money/my money” situation. <br /><strong>Assets: </strong>~$50,000<br /><strong>Debt: </strong>$0<strong><br />Paycheck</strong>: This varies from month to month as a freelancer, but I typically earn between $3,000-$5,000 a month. I also do visual merchandising at a local boutique twice a week, so that gives me a more stable paycheck of around $1,300 a month. My paycheck frequency depends on how many projects I have each month. I currently have three retainer clients that I work with on a regular monthly basis, but I also have other clients that I work with on an as-needed basis, as well as one-off projects. I get biweekly paychecks from the boutique. <br /><br /><strong>Monthly Expenses</strong><br /><br /><strong>Housing Costs: </strong>$1,900 (rent).<br /><strong>Loan Payments</strong>: $0<br /><strong>Cell Phone: </strong>$168 — this includes J.’s plan; we are both paying off new-ish phones in addition to the actual plan.<br /><strong>Internet: </strong>$91 <br /><strong>Spotify:</strong> $20 <br /><strong>Amazon Prime: </strong>$11 <br /><strong>Netflix: </strong>$9 <br /><strong>Hydroelectricity:</strong> ~ $25 (we get charged fluctuating amounts based on our usage and are only billed every few months, but $25 is our monthly average according to our hydro company).</p>



<p><strong>Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?</strong><br />Yes, my parents both come from cultures where education is important and my dad worked in academia. However, I took an alternative route and went to a private fashion and beauty college rather than a regular college or university. I took out a student loan to pay for it, which I paid off in 2020.<br /><br /><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?</strong><br />I was told when we were doing ok financially, and when we needed to focus on saving. Apart from that, my parents did not really educate me about finances.<br /><br /><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?</strong><br />I worked at a rock climbing gym in high school. I wanted to have my own spending money, and I also got to climb for free on the days I worked. <br /><br /><strong>Did you worry about money growing up?</strong><br />Not too much. My mom was a hard worker and she always made sure we were comfortable, but she was transparent about not being able to afford certain things. Still, I never felt that we were seriously struggling. <br /><br /><strong>Do you worry about money now?</strong><br />Somewhat. Things have gotten a lot easier since J. started working again (and got a six figure job to boot), but I also know that life is unpredictable and anything can happen. Even though our household income has essentially tripled since he started working again, I haven’t changed my spending habits very much because I know that our situation could change again.<br /><br /><strong>At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?</strong><br />I moved out of my mom’s place when I was 20. My husband and I have about $50,000 in savings, which we’d like to invest more in the future. <br /><br /><strong>Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.</strong><br />No. </p>



<h3><strong>Day One: Tuesday</strong></h3>



<p>7 a.m. — I wake up to the sound of my alarm, roll out of bed, and head to the bathroom. The cat we’re looking after for the next week follows me in and jumps in the sink while I’m trying to wash my face and brush my teeth. He walks a very fine line between funny, cute, and annoying. We somewhat unexpectedly lost our dog three and a half months ago; she was a senior, but she seemed to be doing so well until her health turned. It’s been absolutely heartbreaking and the grief has been overwhelming at times, so I started pet sitting last month for some non-committal animal companionship. Neither of us feel ready for another dog, but we also miss the presence of a pet at home, so this has been a good solution. I still miss my girl like crazy, but it’s nice to hang out with other animals. I hope she isn’t too offended up in heaven, but I also don’t think she’d want me to be sad all the time. </p>



<p>7:30 a.m. — I make myself breakfast (Greek yogurt with blueberries, peanut butter and honey toast, and a big mug of green tea) and carefully assess how I’m feeling, since I’m meant to go into the boutique and update a window display today. Yesterday I had a blood test that really took it out of me; last year I was diagnosed with a hereditary form of kidney disease (thanks, Dad), so now I need to get biannual blood and urine tests to monitor my kidney function and the progression of the disease. Usually they don’t affect me much, but last night I started feeling super light-headed and headache-y after a simple yoga session. </p>



<p>8 a.m. — After breakfast I’m still not feeling great, so I let the boutique owner know I won’t be coming in. I don’t think running around and climbing on ladders is the best idea for me right now. I wash my dishes and go back to bed to lie down. </p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — I pull my laptop into bed to check if my blood test results are up. They are, so I do a bit of analysis. Overall, all my chemistry, hematology, and mineral levels are within a healthy range, but there are two flags for items that are just under healthy range. I guess that explains my sensitivity to the blood test this time around. I do some more digging to try and better understand the results, and discover that they can be triggered by kidney issues. I share the results with my husband J., who reassures me that everything is probably fine and my nephrologist will let me know if it isn’t. Sigh. I try not to let this disease overtake my life because I’ve statistically still got a few decades until my kidney function really goes down, but it’s something that’s always in the back of my mind now.</p>



<p>9:30 a.m. — A friend calls me to catch up, which is a happy distraction. She lives in another city and we don’t get to see each other very often, so we try to check in with each other every week. She’ll hopefully be moving closer soon, but until then we laugh and share our love through the phone. </p>



<p>10:30 a.m. — I try to get a little bit of freelance work done, because my upcoming workload is looking pretty full with some new client projects on the horizon. There’s one project that I’m close to finishing, so I decide to just work on that today. All I need to do is write one blog article, which I should be capable of doing. I create my outline, start writing, and hope that J. won’t have any distracting calls in the other room. </p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — J. tells me that lunch is heated up (leftover mushroom, zucchini, and lentil pasta), so I head to the dining area. He’s also made me a little salad to ensure I’m eating enough leafy greens (aka iron). He’s so cute. </p>



<p>2:30 p.m. — I go back to my desk to finish up the article. Once I’m done, I check some other client messages: one informs me that we’re switching up pretty much our entire content strategy for the fall, and the other is a new client giving me guidelines for the project. I’m glad that I managed to get the article done so I can focus on my new client project tomorrow. </p>



<p>4:30 p.m. — I check my personal email and see that my Poshmark order (a watercolour print maxi slip dress) has been delivered, so I go to the lobby to pick it up. Generally, I try not to shop for new clothes too much, but this was a good deal and it was filling a gap I had in my closet. I lost a bunch of my summer clothes in transit when we were moving from the UK to Canada, many of which were my favourite dresses (it’s a long story, but basically I shipped a box of clothes to save myself lugging another suitcase during the move and the shipping company discarded it because their label fell off). This new one serves as a replacement. It fits like a glove and J. loves it. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him this enthusiastic about a new piece. </p>



<p>5 p.m. — I’ve been trying to learn my father’s native language after visiting him earlier this year and barely being able to say anything beyond “hi” and “thank you”, so I open up YouTube for some language learning. I love learning languages and find linguistics very interesting, so I’ve been enjoying these little lessons. They’re a great way to stimulate my brain. <strong> </strong></p>



<p>6 p.m. —<strong> </strong>I usually try to end my day with a yoga session, but I’m hesitant because I’m still not feeling 100%. Still, I don’t like how tight my muscles get if I skip a day, so I decide to try a gentle, low to the ground practice; it was a lunge that got me yesterday. The neck circles in the beginning of the practice didn’t feel great for my headache, but I felt ok doing floor poses like butterfly. After the practice, I take a minute to rest and snuggle on the couch with the cat, who enjoys following me around. He can be quite sweet when he wants to be. </p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — We start making dinner, a rice bowl with bok choy, mushrooms, and eggs. It’s one of our go-to easy favorites. </p>



<p>7 p.m. —<strong> </strong>We eat and watch a few episodes of <em>The OC</em>, our current rewatch. For dessert, we have cherries and I sip on my favourite decaf tea (rooibos chai). I’m dreading the end of summer and berry season. </p>



<p>9 p.m. — J. cleans up and does the dishes while I get ready for bed. He wants to game for a bit before sleeping, but I want to read so I go to the bedroom. The cat is passed out on his side when I arrive, it’s pretty cute. I settle in and grab my book; I’ve been making my way through the <em>Wheel of Time</em> series and am currently on book five. It feels like my energy levels are coming back, so I hope a good night’s sleep will get me back to normal for tomorrow. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $0</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Two: Wednesday</strong></h3>



<p>7 a.m. — I wake to my alarm and kitty kisses. I don’t <em>need </em>to get up immediately, so I lay in bed and enjoy the cuddles for a bit before hopping in the shower. </p>



<p>8 a.m. — I make the same breakfast as yesterday because we’re a bit low on other breakfast ingredients (we forgot granola during our last shop and there’s not enough milk for oatmeal). I notice I’m definitely feeling better, which makes me relieved. </p>



<p>9 a.m. —  Focus time. I’m working on website copy for a new client, so the pressure is on. We had a great onboarding chat and I don’t want to let her down. Her industry isn’t one I typically work with, so I’m feeling a little bit nervous, but she also gave me very thorough guidelines and a lot of reference points so I’m sure I can do this. </p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — I have a coffee date with my mom at noon, so I start getting ready. I’ve made some good progress with my copy project already, and besides, taking a break is often the best thing to do to get fresh ideas. <br /></p>



<p>11:45 a.m. — I start walking out. The café we’re meeting at is only a 10-minute walk away, and it’s a gorgeous day. I think about how weird it still feels to walk without my dog, and feel a bout of sadness. I know she would have loved to join me. </p>



<p>12 p.m. — My mom is at the counter when I get to the café. She grabs us a table outside, and I order myself a chai latte. I’m often skeptical about ordering chai because some places make it too weak, but I decide to take a chance and am pleasantly surprised at the spice level. She fills me in on the family gossip and some other personal things. I give her some little gifts I found for her over the past few weeks, and luckily she loves them. <strong>$7</strong></p>



<p>1 p.m. — The café didn’t have proper food, so I’m left to my own devices for lunch. There’s still some leftover pasta that J. conveniently forgot to take to work (typical), so I heat it up and also eat a mandarin as a sweet treat. </p>



<p>2 p.m. — Back to work. I keep researching, refining, and referring to the guidelines and inspirations. I’m feeling pretty good, but I decide I’ll sleep on it before doing final edits just to make sure my brain didn’t get too fuzzy. I still have a few days before the deadline, anyway. </p>



<p>5 p.m. — I share my draft with a friend who works in the industry I’m writing about for feedback, and she gives me amazing insight that I didn’t think of. I should ask for feedback like this more often. Then I take some time to do creative writing. I think it’s good to take time to write for myself instead of just writing for clients. Maybe one day I’ll write a novel. </p>



<p>6 p.m. — Yoga time! I think I’m ready for a more challenging practice, but I still don’t want to push it so I choose one that isn’t super flow-y. I follow it up with a Madfit “lazy girl” floor workout, which challenges my glutes more than I expected, but I guess that’s a good thing. </p>



<p>7 p.m. — I get dinner started, a vegetarian salade niçoise. Halfway through chopping the potatoes I realize we’re out of mustard, but J. says he doesn’t mind. He’s more interested in the potatoes. I go with a simple balsamic vinegar and lemon dressing, and it’s still pretty tasty. </p>



<p>8 p.m. — We put another episode of <em>The OC</em> on, and I make peaches and cream for dessert because we have some vegan whipped cream that probably needs to be used. I haven’t had peaches and cream in years, and remind myself I should make it again before peach season is over. </p>



<p>9 p.m. — I want to go to bed early again because I have a writing webinar first thing in the morning. Sometimes this time zone really doesn’t work in my favor. I wash up and hop into bed to read a little bit before dozing off.<strong> </strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $7</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Three: Thursday</strong></h3>



<p>6 a.m. — My body wakes me up a few minutes before my alarm because of a weird dream. I’m very impressed by my body clock sometimes. I need to wash my hair, but I decide I’ll do it after the webinar, so I just wash my face and brush my teeth.</p>



<p>6:20 a.m. — Yesterday J. picked me up some special granola and a seed mix that are fairly iron-rich, so I pour it over Greek yogurt and add blueberries for breakfast. It’s pretty good. </p>



<p>6:50 a.m. — After I eat, I sip on green tea and check my emails, only to see that the webinar has been cancelled. I feel slightly relieved because I had another blog request come in overnight and am getting a bit stressed about my workload. I check my plan/schedule for the day and rest of the week to reassure myself I have enough time to comfortably meet my deadlines, and I should. I always do this, but it ends up being fine. </p>



<p>7:30 a.m. — Before starting my workday, I throw in a load of laundry (we have coin-operated machines in the building), run the robot vacuum, hop in the shower, then hang the laundry up to dry. I contemplate always waking up earlier, because I feel so productive. Back in the day, I used to work from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. and I loved it — more so for the early finish. I don’t struggle to wake up early if I have something scheduled, but when I’m freelancing I’m more relaxed with my schedule. Oh well, I guess we’ll see what happens. <strong>$3</strong></p>



<p>9:30 a.m. — I start working a little later than planned (I was aiming for 9 a.m.), but I figure since all my errands are out of the way I won’t have any distractions and can just focus. </p>



<p>12 p.m. — I break for lunch. We have some leftover salad, which I add camembert to because I want to conserve our eggs. They’re so expensive these days that I feel bad having them more than a few times a week. After finishing my salad, I grab a mandarin and head to the balcony to sunbathe for a little bit. </p>



<p>1 p.m. — I get back to work, doing some finishing touches and prep work for next week. I submit the new copy project that I was working on yesterday, and thankfully the client loves it! She only requests one minor edit. I don’t know why I was doubting myself. </p>



<p>4 p.m. — Since I’ve prepped what I can so far this week (waiting on details from clients about other projects I have on the horizon), I shift my focus. Earlier in the week an agency owner messaged me on LinkedIn about a part-time role. I was hesitant at first because there were some points in the job description that made me think I might not be qualified, but after texting another freelancer friend for advice I decide to go for it. The application requires a short video recording that sends me into a panic. Why do employers do this? I’m a writer, not a YouTuber! I re-record the video about 20 times before landing on one where I don’t seem entirely nervous and hope for the best. </p>



<p>4:45 p.m. — I take some time for creative writing and language learning. I’m pleasantly surprised that I have time for both today. Maybe I should wake up at 6 a.m. more often.</p>



<p>6 p.m. — Today I feel like there are no excuses for not doing a harder workout, so I do an upper body opening yoga flow and a quick weight workout. I’m not the biggest fan of lifting weights, but I know they’re good for you so I try to do weight workouts a few times a week.  </p>



<p>7 p.m. — I start making dinner, which is a stir-fry with broccoli, peppers, mushrooms, and tofu. J. is working late, but he gets home right when the food is ready. We watch another few episodes of <em>The OC</em>, snack on cherries, and split a brownie he picked up as a little treat for having to work late. </p>



<p>9 p.m. — I start getting ready for bed as I want to try and wake up early again tomorrow. I read a bit and tentatively put my alarm on for 6 a.m.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $3</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Four: Friday</strong></h3>



<p>6 a.m. — I wake with my alarm, but I’ve lost a bit of my motivation. J. and I cuddle for a bit, then I wait for him to leave before I get up. It’s annoying to try and get ready at the same time and I don’t have to take a long hair wash shower this morning, so it’s ok if I rest for a bit. I’ll still manage to stay on my early schedule. </p>



<p>6:45 a.m. — J. leaves for work, so I get out of bed and start getting ready for the day. After freshening up, I make myself green tea and granola with Greek yogurt and blueberries for breakfast. </p>



<p>8 a.m. — I put another load of laundry in. It’s sheets and towels today, so I also change the bedsheets. The cat thinks everything is a game and climbs under the sheets while I try to pull them over the mattress. I reminisce about my dog, who would get annoyed with me for disturbing her peaceful morning snooze when I changed the sheets. She would lie on the duvet, making it hard for me to put the cover on. I miss her terribly. <strong>$3</strong></p>



<p>8:20 a.m. — I start working earlier even though I woke up a bit later than yesterday, success! I’m working a short shift at the boutique later on to cover lunch breaks because they’re short staffed, but I have a blog I need to write, hence why I wanted to wake up earlier. I kind of regret agreeing to the boutique shift, but I guess I called in sick earlier in the week, so whatever. Still, now that J.’s work situation is really settled, I want to scale back at the boutique so I can focus more on my freelancing. That extra boutique income was really helpful when we were dealing with his immigration and he couldn’t work, but now we’re in a better place. I guess I wouldn’t mind doing visuals once a week or so just to get out of the house and express my creativity in another way, but the other boutique work isn’t really what I want to be doing long-term.</p>



<p>9 a.m. — My blog outline is done, so I take a quick break to finish up the laundry. I find it’s helpful to step away for a second after planning and drafts. Ideas, words, and sentences often come to me when I’m doing completely different things<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>9:15 a.m. — I get to work on the draft. It’d be amazing if I finish in the morning, but I have enough time in the afternoon to finish up as well. </p>



<p>11 a.m. — My draft is in good shape, so I start getting ready for my boutique shift. I realize that since I’m covering lunch breaks, I won’t really get to have one myself. I snack on peanut butter toast and a mandarin (it still feels too early to have a proper lunch, and I have to get dressed soonish).</p>



<p>12 p.m. — I get ready to head out. The boutique is only a 20-minute walk away, and the walk gives me a chance to enjoy the sun.</p>



<p>3 p.m. — The sun is still on the balcony when I get back home, so I have a little sunbathe before it’s gone. Afterwards I snack on some hummus, crackers, and another mandarin. I’ll definitely have a more substantial dinner.</p>



<p>4 p.m. — I finish up my blog, write some social media captions for another client, and tentatively plan out my workflow for next week. Then I take some time to do my own thing. Today I also have time for both personal writing and language learning. </p>



<p>6 p.m. — I had a great little creative session, so I hit the mat and do yoga and a weight workout. But first, I roast some veg (broccoli, zucchini, and mushrooms) and chickpeas with zaatar for dinner. </p>



<p>7 p.m. — I boil some couscous and check on the oven. It’s looking good. Every time I make roasted veg I tell myself I should do it more often because it’s just so easy. </p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — We eat dinner, then watch a few episodes of the new season of <em>Wednesday</em>. The cast is great, I’m so glad they brought Fred Armisen back. I have cherries and mini baklava for dessert. </p>



<p>9:30 p.m. — I’m feeling sleepy from my early morning, so I start getting ready for bed and call it a night.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $3</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Five: Saturday</strong></h3>



<p>7 a.m. — I have a full shift at the boutique today, so I don’t care about waking up earlier. I get ready and have granola with blueberries, a mandarin, and green tea for breakfast. </p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — I head out for my walk to work, soaking in as much sun as I can. I wish I didn’t have to spend my day indoors. </p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — I have leftover couscous for my lunch break. I check on messages while I eat: a few client check-ins and some memes from friends. What would we do to stay in touch when nothing much is going on without memes? </p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — I power walk back home after work so I can get to my local drug store before it closes. Luckily, I get there 10 minutes before closing time. I know how annoying last minute customers are, so I make a beeline for the items I need: deodorant and toilet paper. There are good specials on for both, yay! <strong>$13</strong></p>



<p>6 p.m. — Once I get home, I take some time to just decompress before doing yoga. J. starts making an omelet towards the end of my practice. He’s still cooking when I’m done, so I lay down with our new-ish electric massager. I was skeptical of this purchase because we had one before that mostly just got ignored, but this one’s shape is much more comfortable. I vow to personally ensure this purchase goes to use. </p>



<p>7 p.m. — We eat dinner and watch <em>The OC</em>, and I also snack on cherries and chocolate. </p>



<p>9:30 p.m. —  I clean up and start getting ready for bed. I manage to read a little bit before falling asleep. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $13</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Six: Sunday</strong></h3>



<p>8 a.m. — It’s Sunday, so I’m sleeping in. Or at least I try to. The cat has other plans (he’s walking all over and under the bed, and us), but I have a somewhat lazy morning before getting up. </p>



<p>9 a.m. — I finally get up and head to the bathroom to wash up. Then I treat myself to Nutella toast, peaches, and green tea for breakfast. Now that J. is working again, I’m embracing rest and am trying to take more full days off. It’s been much needed. </p>



<p>10 a.m. — We’re going to the beach later because it’s a hot day, but first J. wants to watch football. Rom-coms love to romanticize British men, but they don’t show you how much time they spend watching football. I don’t mind though. It gives me an opportunity to catch up on emails and other little things. </p>



<p>11 a.m. — I do my weekly bathroom clean. Usually, I try to do mini cleans throughout the week in the kitchen and living room so I don’t have one massive clean to do at the end of the week, but with the bathroom I find it easier to do in one go. We run the robot vacuum at the same time. It really has made cleaning so much easier, as I don’t really have to worry about the floor anymore. <em>This </em>is the kind of robot technology we need more of. </p>



<p>12 p.m. — I make spinach quesadillas for lunch, then we start getting ready for the beach. </p>



<p>1 p.m. —<strong> </strong>We head out, but first we stop by our local coffee shop to get some drinks for our walk. I get an iced matcha, J. gets an iced latte and a raspberry bar. <strong>$23</strong></p>



<p>1:45 p.m. — We walk to the beach, lay out our blankets, and soak up the sun. I try to read as much as I can, but get distracted by the other beachgoers and end up eavesdropping a bit. Oops. </p>



<p>3:30 p.m. —  We have plans to hang out with a friend, so we head back to our place because she’s almost there already. </p>



<p>4 p.m. — Our friend is waiting for us outside, so we all head up to our apartment. I want to shower after the beach and we also need to do groceries (our local grocery store does a weekly 10% off on Sundays), so we split up. Our friend goes with J. (groceries are his domain and she enjoys visiting this particular grocery store) while I shower. J. takes my credit card for the groceries because we get extra travel points for food purchases. <strong>$116</strong></p>



<p>5 p.m. — We all meet back in the apartment and hang out for a bit before going out for dinner. We decide to go to a burrito place that we like, but our friend has never been to. </p>



<p>6 p.m. — We walk because it’s still nice out. I feel a bit sad when we arrive, because the last time we went there was with our dog for New Year’s; the restaurant has one of the city’s best dog-friendly patios and there are indeed a lot of dogs there. Still, the company and the food is good. I order a veggie burrito bowl with brussel sprouts, cauliflower, black beans, and greens. J. pays. </p>



<p>8 p.m. — We walk back home and say bye to our friend, who we plan to see next week for a night market in her neighborhood. </p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — After washing up and changing into lounge clothes, we watch our favourite guilty pleasure show: <em>90 Day Fiancé</em>. We don’t watch a lot of trashy reality TV, but <em>90 Day</em> is our kryptonite. It’s probably because we’re also an international couple, so it always has a certain level of relatability for us. </p>



<p>10 p.m. — We feel ready for bed after the end of the episode, so we brush our teeth and call it a night. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $139</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Seven: Monday</strong></h3>



<p>7 a.m. — I wake up to my alarm and get up immediately because I have another full day at the boutique. It should go by fast as I’m catching up on the visuals I didn’t get to do last week, then I’ll have the rest of the week off for writing. I get ready and make myself granola with peaches and blueberries for breakfast. </p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — I head out and walk to work. It’s another beautiful day. </p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — J. made me a spinach and camembert sandwich for lunch, which I eat on my break. He’s so forgetful with his own work lunches, but he’ll always make me something if we don’t have leftovers. It’s cute.</p>



<p>5:15 p.m. — I meet up with my mom after work because she picked up pasta and black beans for us at Costco. We don’t feel that we buy in bulk enough to warrant a membership of our own, but she offers to get us non-perishables when we need them. I also buy a 15lb bag of rice from another grocery store. Our cupboards will be all set for a while. <strong>$39</strong></p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — I get home and check on a few client notifications I missed during the day. I try not to do actual work on boutique days, but I like to ensure I’m always communicative. </p>



<p>6 p.m. — I rolled out my yoga mat and chose a super stretchy practice because I missed yoga yesterday. It feels amazing.</p>



<p>6:45 p.m. — I make another bok choy rice bowl for dinner. We find bok choy goes off pretty fast, so it’s usually one of the first things we make after grocery day. I also add avocado, because we have two that ripened all of a sudden. The avocado is absolutely perfect. I hope a special word that describes the niche feeling of relief and satisfaction you get when you slice open a perfect avocado (or do something else similar) exists in some language. </p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — There’s another <em>90 Day</em> spin-off on, so we have another trash TV night while snacking on more cherries and chocolate. This franchise keeps us busy. </p>



<p>9:30 p.m. — Time for bed! I get ready and spend a bit of time reading before dozing off. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $39</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>“All in all, this was a pretty standard week for me. I’ve reined in on the unnecessary purchases lately because we’re going on a vacation soon, so I’m trying to save with that in mind. Still, I’ve been wanting to enjoy the summer, so I will loosen the purse strings on little treats like café drinks. I’m going to keep focusing on my freelance work so that I can hopefully leave the boutique and earn more on my terms while still having time for rest and self-care. I definitely feel better now that J. is working again and I can have some breathing room, but it’s also important for me to have my own source of income. This past year has taught me that you never know what the future holds, so let’s see what happens!”</p>
