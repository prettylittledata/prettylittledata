<p>Ramand is, before being a project, a decision—a decision about how a cube can stand on a dual-cornered site without compromising its own geometry and without disregarding the city. The wooden volume is a controlled rotation, neither a formal gesture nor an exaggeration; merely the minimal deviation required for the form to settle into the site. Its geometry does not impose itself on the city, but aligns with it. The wooden skin is not an emotional choice, but a means to soften the hard cube. In a site surrounded by schools, the wood transforms potential seriousness into a conversational tone, aware of the daily gaze of children building their spatial memory.</p>",

<p>This is a private house in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/jakarta"">Jakarta</a>, Indonesia, for a dentist couple with 2 kids. The site is a typical rectangular shape, with both sides and the rear of the house closed off from the neighboring houses, and no ventilation or sunlight can be expected from the side openings. The front façade faces neighboring houses. Despite these challenges, homeowners desire a home that feels open and lush with greenery.</p>",

<p>""We approach the construction of the academies as an opportunity to reactivate community culture. The proposal seeks not only to mend the existing spatial fabric of the city but also trace and reveal the valuable cultural threads embedded in its surroundings. We hope to 'nourish' the future of the district, weaving a more generous urban space and a richer urban life through the architectural design of two new schools.""Meng Yan.</p>",

<p>The design and construction of a project on a steeply sloped terrain in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/shandiz"">Shandiz</a>, adjacent to a seasonal river, with mandatory boundary consideration and a weekend villa program, was assigned to the Abar office. According to regulations, the project was permitted to construct two stories above ground and one basement level. This perpetual regulation has led to repetitive typologies that, on one hand, due to the relentless villa development in the region (in a situation similar to apartment typology), obstruct the view of the valley and distort the natural landscape, and on the other hand, result in stereotypical programs that sometimes have no connection to the user's lifestyle and creating ""possibilities"" in their experience. Despite having previously prepared complete plans, the client requested a redesign due to unmet needs; a matter we analyzed as the ""Difference between In-Town and Out-of-Town Housing"".</p>",

<h4>A framework for Crisis Information Design.</h4><figure><img alt=""AI FAKE: Image of a church in Puerto Vallarta burning — it never happened"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-Fc3QEA3pxsnJBx4twb6ag.jpeg"" /><figcaption>FAKE!!! This image was shared on social media and confirmed as fake by <a href=""https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/puerto-vallarta-cartel-church-fire/"">Snopes</a></figcaption></figure><p>People can no longer tell the difference between real images and AI-generated ones. That’s not an opinion. It’s a <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120481119"">finding from researchers at UC Berkeley and SUNY Buffalo</a>, who demonstrated that AI-synthesized faces are now perceived as more trustworthy than real human faces. Let that sink in for a second: the fake version of reality is <em>more</em> believable than reality itself.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aap9559"">misinformation spreads six times faster than true information</a> on social media. During a crisis, when stress and fear impair our ability to think critically, the information ecosystem becomes a minefield.</p><p>The platforms where people actually consume information during emergencies (WhatsApp, X, Facebook, Reddit) have <em>zero</em> verification infrastructure at the point of consumption. The tools that can verify content (Snopes, PolitiFact, C2PA, SynthID, Hive AI) exist on entirely separate platforms, accessed hours later, long after the damage is done.</p><p>This is a design problem. Not a policy problem. Not a content moderation problem. A design problem. And it’s one that the UX community has barely started to address.</p><p>This isn’t just theoretical. In February 2026, I <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/caught-between-fake-news-and-predatory-paywalls-4500e2ac6ddd"">watched it unfold in real time</a> while sheltering in place during a crisis in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. What I experienced that day revealed a set of systemic failures that I’ve spent the last few days trying to make sense of. This article is the result: a framework for designers who want to build information products that actually work when people need them most.</p><p>But first, some context. Because the problem didn’t start with AI. It has been escalating since the beginning of the internet.</p><h3>The three eras of information credibility</h3><figure><img alt=""Timeline of three eras of information credibility. Era 1: The Gatekept Internet (1960s-2000s), where institutional gatekeepers controlled access. Era 2: The Social Media Revolution (2004–2022), where users must evaluate credibility themselves. Era 3: The AI Deepfake Era (2023-present), where AI-generated content is photorealistic and weaponized during crises."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*wCHB-o6eGdR-vpzdJWyGtg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Three Eras of Information Credibility</figcaption></figure><h4>Era 1: The gatekept internet (1960s to 2000s)</h4><p>The internet wasn’t built for everyone. It was built for institutions. <a href=""https://www.internetsociety.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/"">ARPANET</a> connected universities and military installations. <a href=""https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html"">Tim Berners-Lee’s original 1989 proposal</a> at CERN was a document management system for physicists.</p><p>The early web was credible by default because the barrier to publishing was the verification. If something was online, it came from a credentialed source. Military. Academic. Government.</p><p>Users didn’t need to evaluate credibility. The system did it for them.</p><p>This era built an assumption into the fabric of digital products that we’ve never fully shaken: that information, once published, is probably true.</p><h4>Era 2: The social media revolution (2004 to 2022)</h4><p>Then everything changed. Facebook launched in 2004. YouTube in 2005. Twitter in 2006. Reddit in 2005. Suddenly, <em>everyone</em> could publish. Credible or not. Educated or not. Reality or not.</p><p>For the first time in the history of the internet, the burden of evaluating credibility shifted entirely to the individual user. But nobody designed the tools to help them do it. <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pragma.2013.07.012"">Research by Metzger and Flanagin</a> showed that users rely on <strong>cognitive shortcuts</strong> (how professional does the site look? do other people seem to trust it?) rather than actual verification.</p><p>By 2016, the consequences were visible to everyone. <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.31.2.211"">Allcott and Gentzkow’s analysis</a> of fake news during the U.S. presidential election documented how <strong>fabricated stories spread faster</strong> and wider than corrections.</p><p>The credibility problem is a design failure and not a problem with the technology. We gave everyone a megaphone and nobody a filter. We're not teaching people how to actually think critically about evaluating what's true.</p><h4>Era 3: The AI deepfake era (2023 to present)</h4><p>Now here we are... AI-generated content is photorealistic, produced in seconds, and the tools to create it are free. The distinction between “real” and “generated” has collapsed for the average person. And during crises, these tools are being weaponized in real time, exacerbating the problem.</p><p>The evidence is recent and specific. During a crisis in Mexico in February 2026, an AI-generated image of the Our Lady of Guadalupe cathedral in Puerto Vallarta engulfed in flames went viral across X, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram.</p><p><a href=""https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/puerto-vallarta-cartel-church-fire/"">Snopes confirmed</a> it was generated by Google Gemini. <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/search/?q=Our+Lady+of+Guadalupe+cathedral+in+Puerto+Vallarta+"">PolitiFact rated it fabricated</a>, with <a href=""https://hivemoderation.com"">Hive AI detecting it as synthetic with 99.9% confidence</a>. Google’s own <a href=""https://deepmind.google/technologies/synthid/"">SynthID watermark</a> was embedded in the image. The Gemini logo was still on it.</p><p>None of this information reached the people sharing it in WhatsApp groups while they sheltered in their homes.</p><p>Each era created a new credibility challenge. Design never caught up. We’re still building information products on Era 1 assumptions in an Era 3 world.</p><h3>What crisis information failure looks like from the inside</h3><p>I live in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico during the winter. It’s my second home. I’ve been coming here for years, originally from the U.S., now based in France. On February 22, 2026, a crisis erupted across the state of Jalisco. I woke up to explosions and smoke rising a block from my apartment.</p><p>What followed was a frantic scramble for information that exposed every failure I’ve just described.</p><p>WhatsApp became my primary source. People shared real updates: road closures, fire locations, which neighborhoods to avoid. But in the same thread, someone posted a video of a church burning down. A friend called it out as fake. It never happened.</p><p>For the minutes before that correction, though, it was real to everyone in the group. Someone else shared a rumor about street violence at noon. No source. No verification. Just a sentence typed into a chat that changed my behavior for hours. I closed my blinds and didn’t open them.</p><p>My husband used Grok on X to try to synthesize what was happening. He ran a deep search across 150+ sources and shared the result with our group:</p><blockquote>“The rumor is unverified social-media panic with no credible source or backing from authorities or news outlets.”</blockquote><p>That <em>actually</em> helped. That was technology doing what it should do in a crisis: separating signal from noise. It was one of the few bright spots of the day.</p><p>Then came the moment that still makes me angry.</p><p>Someone shared a New York Times link in the group. Finally, a trusted, verified, globally respected source. I clicked it. Paywall. I tried to sign in. Password reset. Two-factor authentication. Redirected. Looped. I did all of this on my phone while checking through the blinds for new columns of smoke.</p><p>I gave up and went back to the rumor mill.</p><p>The equation should trouble everyone who builds information products: misinformation was free and everywhere. The truth was paywalled and broken. I wrote about this experience in more detail in a <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/caught-between-fake-news-and-predatory-paywalls-4500e2ac6ddd"">previous article</a>, but the short version is this:</p><blockquote>The User Experience of finding trustworthy information during a crisis is a nightmare... not because the information doesn’t exist, but because the design fails.</blockquote><p>The U.S. State Department posted a shelter-in-place advisory on X at 1:17 p.m. I’d been living the crisis since 8:15 a.m. Five hours of silence from official channels.</p><p>That experience left me with something more than frustration. It left me with the urge to create a framework to support this from happening again.</p><h3>The Crisis Information Design Framework</h3><p>What I experienced in Puerto Vallarta was three interconnected failures happening simultaneously and I’ve spent the last few days pulling them apart and synthesizing them into a model that designers can actually use.</p><p>The Crisis Information Design Framework has three layers. Each layer answers a different question and addresses a different stage of the design process: diagnose, prioritize, execute.</p><figure><img alt=""Three-column overview: Diagnose, Prioritize, Execute.

On WhatsApp, on X, in group chats with shaking hands.</p><p><strong>Verification</strong> happened hours later, on <a href=""https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/puerto-vallarta-cartel-church-fire/"">Snopes</a>, on <a href=""https://www.politifact.com"">PolitiFact</a>, through <a href=""https://c2pa.org"">C2PA content credentials</a> analysis, via <a href=""https://hivemoderation.com"">Hive AI</a> detection.</p><p>The gap between those two moments is where misinformation does its damage. People act on unverified information because verified information doesn’t reach them in time, in the same place, or in the same format.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram of the Verification Gap. Top layer: where people consume information instantly during crises, on WhatsApp, Facebook, X, Signal, Reddit, SMS. Bottom layer: where verification happens hours later on Snopes, PolitiFact, C2PA/SynthID, Hive AI.

If the answer is no, you have a Verification Gap.</p><h4>Layer 2: Information Hierarchy of Needs (Prioritize)</h4><p>When you’re counting the food in your fridge and wondering if your electricity will stay on, <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1037/h0054346"">Maslow’s hierarchy of needs</a> stops being a framework you learned in school and becomes your new operating system.</p><p>The same principle applies to information design. I’m proposing an Information Hierarchy of Needs with five levels, built from the base up:</p><ol><li><strong>VERIFICATION (base): </strong>Is this real? Is this verified? Can I act on this safely?</li><li><strong>SOURCE: </strong>Where did this come from? Who created it? Are they credible?</li><li><strong>RECENCY: </strong>Is this current or outdated? During a crisis, two-hour-old information can be out of date and factually incorrect.</li><li><strong>CONTEXT: </strong>What does this mean for me, here, right now?</li><li><strong>DEPTH (top): </strong>Full understanding. Nuance.

You can’t build for depth when users can’t even tell if what they’re looking at is real.</p><p><a href=""https://www.citybureau.org/notebook/2019/7/17/journalism-is-a-luxury-information-is-a-necessity"">City Bureau</a> has developed a related “information needs” concept for community journalism, but the application to product design is distinct. The question for designers isn’t, “What stories does this community need?” It’s “Does your product help users verify before they act?”</p><h4>Layer 3: Trauma-Informed Information Design (Execute)</h4><p>The third layer addresses how to build it right. <a href=""https://ncsacw.acf.gov/topics/trauma-informed-care/"">SAMHSA’s six principles of trauma-informed care</a>, originally developed for healthcare and social services, translate <em>directly</em> to digital product design during crisis information experiences. I’ve adapted each one for my framework:</p><ul><li><strong>Safety.</strong> Verification is visible at the point of consumption. No ambiguity about what’s verified versus what’s not. Don’t autoplay graphic content.</li><li><strong>Trustworthiness.</strong> Source provenance is always shown. No dark patterns in authentication flows. No deceptive interstitials during crisis access.</li><li><strong>Peer Support.</strong> Community verification layers. Crowd-sourced flagging. Surface it when multiple users flag the same content.</li><li><strong>Collaboration.</strong> Platform and official source integration. Pin verified government updates. Partner with fact-checkers in real time.</li><li><strong>Empowerment.</strong> User control over information filtering. Agency over what they see. Not algorithmic force-feeding of engagement-optimized fear.</li><li><strong>Cultural Awareness.</strong> Multilingual. Locally contextualized. Accessible under stress: larger touch targets, simplified flows, offline capability.</li></ul><p>Trauma-informed design has been applied in healthcare and social services for over a decade, guided by SAMHSA’s 2014 framework (Link above) and subsequent implementation research by Menschner and Maul for the <a href=""https://www.chcs.org/resource/trauma-informed-care-implementation-resource-center/"">Center for Health Care Strategies</a>.</p><p>It has not yet been applied to crisis misinformation or information product design. That’s the gap this framework addresses.</p><figure><img alt=""Six-card grid of SAMHSA’s trauma-informed care principles adapted for crisis information design.

It attaches origin metadata to images so provenance can be verified.</p><p>Google’s <a href=""https://deepmind.google/technologies/synthid/"">SynthID</a> embeds imperceptible watermarks into AI-generated content.</p><p><a href=""https://hivemoderation.com"">Hive Moderation</a> provides AI detection tools that can identify synthetic content with high confidence. The technology exists.</p><p>On the policy side, the <a href=""https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act-package"">EU Digital Services Act</a> includes a crisis-response mechanism (Article 36) that requires platforms to take “proportionate and effective” measures during emergencies. It was first activated during the Israel-Hamas conflict in 2023.</p><p>X’s <a href=""https://communitynotes.x.com"">Community Notes</a> provides crowd-sourced context on posts.</p><p>Google’s <a href=""https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/"">Fact Check Tools API</a> lets developers surface fact-checks programmatically.</p><p>So the building blocks are there. What’s missing is the design layer that connects them to users at the moment they need them.</p><p>No messaging app (WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram) has a crisis verification mode. No platform surfaces C2PA or SynthID metadata to end users in a meaningful way. No emergency paywall protocol is industry-standard. Some outlets <a href=""https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk"">dropped paywalls during COVID</a>, including the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and The Atlantic, but it was ad hoc, not systematic.</p><p>And the fundamental architecture of verification remains broken: the tools that can tell you whether something is real exist on entirely different platforms from the ones where you encounter the content.</p><p>That’s the Verification Gap, operating at an industry level.</p><h3>What designers and product teams can do</h3><h4>For messaging platforms (WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram)</h4><p>Build a crisis mode. When a region-specific crisis is declared, enable verified source badges, rumor-flagging, and pinned official updates within group chats. Surface SynthID and C2PA metadata inline.</p><p>If an image has an AI watermark, show it before users share.</p><p>Let users flag content as unverified and surface flag counts to group members.</p><h4>For news organizations</h4><p>Implement emergency open-access protocols. Automatic paywall drops during declared emergencies within affected regions. Geofenced, time-limited, automated.</p><p>And PLEASE: no sign-in loops, no credit card prompts, no redirect chains during a crisis!!!</p><p>If someone is in a crisis zone, remove <em>every</em> barrier between them and verified information. The sign-in experience I had with the New York Times while smoke was visible from my window should never happen to anyone.</p><h4>For social platforms (X, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram)</h4><p>Build verification-first feeds during crises. When a crisis is detected, re-rank feeds to prioritize verified sources over engagement metrics. Before users share flagged AI-generated content, show a verification prompt: “This image may be AI-generated. View analysis. Share anyway.” That single interstitial could have prevented the cathedral image from going viral.</p><h4>For every product that asks users to trust information</h4><p>Apply the Information Hierarchy of Needs as a design audit. Does your product serve the base of the pyramid before the top? Apply Trauma-Informed Design principles. Is your product safe for someone whose hands are shaking, who hasn’t slept, who is making survival decisions based on what they see on their screen?</p><p>If you’re not sure, the answer is probably no. And that’s where the work starts.</p><p>The crisis I experienced wasn’t unique. Crises are accelerating: climate disasters, political instability, public health emergencies. Every one of them will be accompanied by an information crisis. And every information crisis will now include AI-generated content designed to confuse, inflame, and manipulate.</p><p>The technology to solve this exists. C2PA can prove provenance. SynthID can detect AI content. Fact-checkers can verify claims. The problem isn’t capability. It’s design. None of these tools reach users at the moment they need them most.</p><p>This is our problem. And designers are the ones who can solve it.</p><p>The Crisis Information Design Framework is a lens that can be applied to any product that asks users to trust what they’re seeing. Because in a crisis, the UX of information isn’t about a feature, it’s literally about survival.</p><p><a href=""https://www.joshlamar.com/"">Josh LaMar</a> is CEO of <a href=""https://www.amplinate.com/"">Amplinate</a>, where he advises on product growth and AI decision strategy.

Before you even finished your thought, they were nodding. How did they get to the finish line before you did?</em></p><p><em>If empathy was supposed to solve this, it hasn’t.</em></p><p><em>I’m </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/natesowder/""><strong><em>Nate Sowder</em></strong></a><em> (fresh off parental leave), and this is </em><strong><em>unquoted, installment 16.</em></strong><em> It’s on Adam Smith — and the uncomfortable possibility that we’ve misunderstood what it means to understand each other in the first place.</em></p><h3>Adam Smith (not the Econ 101 mascot)</h3><p>When we hear “<a href=""https://www.adamsmithworks.org/documents/otteson-brief-smith-bio"">Adam Smith</a>,” we think capitalism, free markets… the invisible hand. All of this comes from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations""><em>The Wealth of Nations</em></a>, published in 1776.</p><p>Seventeen years earlier, Smith wrote a different book: <a href=""https://www.adamsmithworks.org/documents/asw-edition""><em>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</em></a>. It’s writing this book that shaped his thinking about human behavior, and it’s where we’ll be spending our time today. In fact, unlike his other works, Smith revised this piece 6 times, the last time on his death bed. If you want to know where someone’s head is at… 6 revisions.</p><p>In this book, Smith wrestled with a basic question:</p><h4>How do we decide whether someone’s reaction makes sense?</h4><p>When someone is furious, do we think they’re overreacting? When someone is hurt, do we think they’re justified? When someone celebrates, does the celebration fit the act?</p><p>We feel all of this constantly, but Smith was looking to uncover the process by which we rationalize it.</p><h3>Sympathy and empathy</h3><p>To understand Smith’s thought process, you need to understand how he used the word <a href=""https://oll.libertyfund.org/quotes/adam-smith-selfishness-sympathy""><strong><em>sympathy</em></strong></a><strong><em>,</em></strong><em> </em>because it wasn’t reserved for greeting cards and florists like we use it today.</p><p>For him, sympathy was the act of imagining yourself in another person’s situation in order to judge it proportionately. You don’t need to feel their experience directly, but you try to build a version of it using your own memories and perspective.</p><p>To qualify as ‘sympathy’, the version you build in your mind is supposed to be partial and <strong>always</strong> incomplete. This means that the level in which you’re able to understand can change and you have to acknowledge that.</p><p>Sympathy in Smith’s terms can be defined as: <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/smith-moral-political/#:~:text=In%20his%20%E2%80%9CHistory%20of%20Astronomy,between%20theoretical%20and%20ordinary%20thought.""><strong>disciplined approximation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>The word we tend to use now is <strong><em>empathy</em>.</strong></p><p>Empathy is more concrete. It implies a level of understanding. “I get it.” “I know exactly how you feel.” That language suggests that the gap between two people can be understood.</p><p>Adam Smith never believed that two people could fully understand each other. Therefore, empathy, the way we use it today, wouldn’t work for Smith.</p><h3>What sympathy requires</h3><p>In 1759, Smith identified that genuine understanding requires time, humility and proximity.</p><p>Let’s look at each one.</p><p>T<strong>ime</strong>.<br />Smith thought it took time to understand. Our first reaction to someone’s situation is often incomplete and biased. It takes time to sit with what we heard and let the initial judgement pass. Time to reconsider whether our response actually resonates.</p><p>Sometimes that means repeated exposure and other times it just means not reacting immediately.</p><p><strong>Humility</strong>.<br />Humility, in Smith’s framework, meant recognizing the limits of your first judgment.</p><p>This meant not rushing to explain your own interpretation, and not immediately taking your turn to clarify, defend, or relate it back to yourself.</p><p>In practice, that often means letting the other person’s statement be enough without having to make it about you. This would allow you to suspend your need to respond long enough to examine whether your internal picture of the situation is accurate.</p><p>Without humility, the conversation becomes a rotation of perspectives. In other words, it’s no longer listening… you’ve entered a debate.</p><p><strong>Proximity</strong>.<br />Smith opens <em>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</em> by noting that we are more affected by the misfortune of someone close to us than someone at a notable distance. Distance can tend to distort our reaction.</p><p><strong>According to Smith, that distortion shows up as</strong><a href=""https://www.adamsmithworks.org/documents/adam-smith-and-the-natural-law-the-impartial-spectator-synderesis-and-moral-judgment-properly-understood""><strong> judgement</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>The further we are from someone’s lived experience, the more our imagination fills gaps with our own memories and experiences. The answer to someone else’s problem might feel obvious, but under closer inspection starts to get more complicated the more effort we put toward trying to understand.</p><p>Proximity forces us to account for details we couldn’t see from a distance.</p><h3>Sympathy is intentional</h3><p>Let’s take a moment to explain this, because not only was it an important distinction to Smith, it’s what the rest of this essay is based on.</p><p>Sympathy (as is laid out by Adam Smith) requires you to set aside the instinct to orient the situation around yourself. You build a picture of the other person’s experience and examine whether your judgement makes sense.</p><p>Empathy, <strong>as we commonly use it in conversation (and research)</strong>, often works differently. It looks inward, searching your own memories and experiences for something similar so you can translate that experience into terms you already know. Empathy feels pretty immediate, which can feel good for the person showing it, and can create connection.</p><p>A big distinction is that empathy stops growing the moment inward connection is made. Sympathy, on the other hand, asks if you understand rather than if you can relate. Big difference.</p><p>Neither of these make for better or worse people. But I think it’s important that only one of them encourages revision.</p><h3>Spectator Model</h3><p>Smith described how our first judgments form, and how hard it is to revise them. The “Impartial Spectator” was his name for the internal witness that can interrupt that process, but we have to do that intentionally.</p><p>What helped me while reading him was laying out his observations side by side. When I did this, I saw that deeper understanding develops if you’re willing to invest effort.</p><p>The point of the Spectator Model is to help you abstract your level of understanding. From there, you’re left with two decisions. 1. Are you sufficed with your current level of understanding? and 2. What would it take to go further in that understanding.</p><p>And it’s worth saying: You don’t always need to push all the way to truth. Sometimes ‘Awareness’ is the right level. The model is designed to make intent possible. This way, you can decide whether an additional conversation, meeting or investment in research is worth it, given your current level of understanding.</p><p>Here’s what the model looks like.</p><figure><img alt=""A funnel-shaped diagram titled “The Spectator Model.” Six bands narrow from Assumption to Interpretation, Awareness, Understanding, Immersion, and Truth. Arrows on the left list Curiosity, Humility, Proximity, Time, and Consequence, pointing inward toward deeper understanding. Arrows on the right list Comfort, Habit, Pride, Speed, and Certainty, pointing outward. The model shows that understanding deepens with intentional effort and drifts outward without it."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*k3o07HWrnWhs99g8EEm6FQ.png"" /><figcaption>Spectator Model — Developed by Nate Sowder <strong>© 2026</strong></figcaption></figure><h3>How to use it</h3><p>Any time you form a judgment about someone, you are somewhere in this model.</p><p>That judgment happens a lot in personal conversation. We’re going to think about it here in terms of a product reviews, or more specifically, what might happen during research when you determine what a user “meant.”</p><p>In that moment, Smith would argue that you should be able to abstract your current level of understanding (or sympathy). Again, we’re not trying to be dramatic. Sympathy just means an acknowledgement that we cannot fully understand another person’s situation (no matter how much we may want to).</p><p><strong>Ask yourself:</strong><br />Are you operating mostly from what you already believed?<br />Have you filtered what you heard through your existing lens?<br />Has anything caused you to reconsider your first interpretation?</p><p>That act of locating yourself is the beginning of sympathy. From there, you’re left with decisions that empathy doesn’t afford because empathy assumes completion.</p><p><strong>Decide: </strong><br />Does the situation require deeper understanding? <strong>If no</strong>, you can stop. Not every moment deserves immersion. Sometimes awareness is enough.</p><p>If <strong>yes</strong>, look to the left of the model. If stakes matter, and moving inward is important, it requires investment. The labels to the left show the act required to move between bands.</p><p><strong>If Yes: </strong><br />From <strong>Assumption</strong> → <strong>Interpretation</strong> requires <strong>Curiosity<br /></strong>From <strong>Interpretation </strong>→ <strong>Awareness</strong> requires <strong>Humility</strong><br />From <strong>Awareness </strong>→ <strong>Understanding</strong> requires <strong>Proximity</strong><br />From <strong>Understanding</strong> → <strong>Immersion</strong> requires <strong>Time</strong><br />From <strong>Immersion</strong> → <strong>Truth </strong>requires <strong>Consequence</strong></p><p>Again, motion is what makes this model powerful. Because you can move inward in your level of understanding, you can also move outward. That outward movement is often when people begin to feel unheard… not only in personal conversations, but in research, strategy and leadership decisions.</p><p>This model is meant to be an abstraction to help you locate your current level of understanding. If you decide not to invest further, nothing crazy happens, but the next time you’re faced with that topic, your response will come from wherever you stopped.</p><p>Working toward sympathy keeps you oriented inward toward revision, and greater accuracy. Deciding that your level of understanding is “good enough” carries risk. By risk, I don’t mean moral failure or bad intent, just this: your response will be guided by the forces on the right side of the model, based on the level where you left off.</p><p><strong>If No: </strong><br /><strong>Certainty, Speed, Pride, Habit, Comfort</strong></p><p>We’ve talked a lot about Empathy and Sympathy. As we tend to use it, empathy often feels like understanding. Sympathy assumes you have to continuously invest effort.</p><p>When you feel like you “get it,” you stop trying. And whatever shaped your interpretation up to that point (including your own stories and experiences) will also shape your response.</p><h3>Adam Smith</h3><p>For 250 years, Adam Smith’s <em>Theory of Moral Sentiments</em> has been read for its moral philosophy and largely overshadowed by his economics. What it offers, though, is a disciplined way to think about how we judge one another, and how bad we are at it.</p><p>The <strong>Spectator Model</strong> is my attempt to make that discipline visible and extend Smith into contexts he never had to imagine.</p><p>I don’t believe sympathy was ever supposed to be sentimental. In Smith’s hands, it was procedural. What I’ve tried to do here is make that procedure mappable.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=f3dad8ab37a8"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/dear-diary-youre-the-last-good-listener-f3dad8ab37a8"">Dear diary, you’re the last good listener</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Your chatbot would praise your worst ideas. Here’s how to design interfaces that push back instead.</h4><figure><img alt=""Modern reinterpretation of Velázquez’s Las Meninas (1656): the original court scene with the Infanta Margarita at centre, surrounded by her attendants, but overlaid with glowing blue chat bubbles, message interfaces, and digital speech icons floating throughout the composition. The courtiers appear to be holding tablets and phones, creating a visual metaphor of the royal court as an echo chamber of digital agreement."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1ccyXZIy38REZzNVcUbFjA.png"" /><figcaption>Image based on Las Meninas by Velázquez (1656)</figcaption></figure><p>Throwback to the last time this happened to you. You’re brainstorming with a chatbot. Somehow, every idea you throw out gets an enthusiastic response. First, it’s “<em>great thinking</em>!” Next, you hear “<em>that’s a really interesting angle.</em>” By the time you get to “<em>you’re onto something here,</em>” you wonder if you should be running for president with all the wisdom you seem to possess.</p><p>It feels productive. Validating, even. You’re generating ideas faster than you would alone, and the assistant seems genuinely impressed by your creativity. But here’s the (possibly) painful reality: it would have said the same thing if your ideas were terrible.</p><p><strong>This is the echo chamber problem in conversational interfaces. Not a filter bubble curated by algorithms, but something more intimate. </strong>A one-on-one exchange designed to agree with you, validate you, and reflect your thinking back with a polish that makes it feel smarter than it actually is.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/bad-model-behaviour-by-design-af0b514a1314"">In the previous piece</a>, we looked at how human-AI interaction creates a cycle of bias. The pattern where small nudges stack up over time until users start thinking like the machine without realising it. The research pointed to a particular type of interface where this effect hits hardest: one that feels natural, helpful, and conversational.</p><p>Enter your chatbot.</p><p>The question is what we do about it. Can we build interactions that push back rather than just nod along?</p><h3>The yes-man algorithm</h3><p>Why do chatbots agree with everything? It’s not a bug. It’s how the system was trained.</p><p>Most conversational AI is shaped by something called reinforcement learning from human feedback, or RLHF. The short version: humans rate the AI’s responses, and the model learns to produce more of what gets positive ratings. Sounds sensible enough.</p><p>The problem is what “positive” tends to mean in practice. Responses that feel helpful, friendly, and validating score well. Responses that challenge, question, or push back? Less so. Over thousands of training cycles, the model learns a simple lesson: agreeable is good.</p><p>The result is what researchers have started calling <a href=""https://www.anthropic.com/research/towards-understanding-sycophancy-in-language-models"">sycophancy</a>. Systems that affirm, validate, and support whatever you say. If your early messages hint at a particular belief, the AI adjusts to align with it. Not just on that topic, but across the conversation. It learns your wavelength and stays on it.</p><p>This creates a feedback loop at the conversation level. Your opening statements set the tone. The AI confirms and extends. You feel understood, so you share more. The AI matches that too. With each exchange, it becomes less likely to introduce anything that might disrupt the harmony.</p><p>Users often mistake this agreeableness for accuracy. The chatbot sounds confident. It validates your thinking. It must be right. But confidence isn’t competence. And validation isn’t verification.</p><figure><img alt=""Downward spiral diagram showing how conversations narrow into echo chambers.

The problem isn’t that we work with AI. It’s that we work with AI designed to please rather than to probe.</p><p>This reframes the brief. The goal isn’t to maximise user satisfaction. It’s to optimise how humans and machines think together. And sometimes, that means building interfaces that slow you down rather than speed you up.</p><p>Designers already know this. We add friction all the time when the stakes are high enough. Confirmation dialogs before deleting files. Extra steps before unsubscribing. “Are you sure?” prompts when the action can’t be undone. These aren’t obstacles. They’re cognitive forcing functions. Moments that require you to stop, think, and decide deliberately.</p><p>The same principle applies to conversational interfaces. If unchecked agreement creates echo chambers, then designed disagreement can break them.</p><p>That doesn’t mean making chatbots annoying or contrarian. It’s about building interactions that keep users thinking rather than deferring. One that occasionally says “<em>have you considered the opposite?</em>” or “<em>here’s where this might fall apar</em>t” isn’t being unhelpful. It’s doing the work that a good collaborator would do.</p><p>The trick is knowing when to apply it.</p><h3>Patterns that break the loop</h3><p>So what does productive friction actually look like in practice? Here are a few approaches that can interrupt the echo chamber without killing the user experience.</p><h4><strong>Transparency about uncertainty</strong></h4><p>Most chatbots project confidence even when they shouldn’t. A product that can say “<em>I’m not sure about this</em>” or “<em>my knowledge gets patchy at this point</em>” gives users a reason to pause and verify. Confidence scores, probability ranges, or simple hedging language all help. The goal is to signal when the user should lean in rather than lean back.</p><h4><strong>Designed counterarguments</strong></h4><p>Don’t wait for users to ask for a second opinion. Surface it by default. “<em>On the other hand, the strongest argument against this position…</em>” or “<em>some people would disagree because…</em>” can be built into the response pattern rather than hidden behind a prompt. Devil’s advocate shouldn’t be a special mode. It should be part of how the system thinks out loud.</p><h4><strong>Accountability prompts</strong></h4><p>Automation bias thrives when decisions feel automatic. Making the human sign-off explicit can change that. Instead of “<em>AI recommends this candidate</em>,” try “<em>You’re approving this candidate based on AI input.</em>” The subtle shift in framing reminds users that the final call is theirs. Audit trails and decision logs reinforce this further.</p><h4><strong>The “consider the opposite” nudge</strong></h4><p><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4797953/"">Research on selective exposure</a> shows that prompting people to evaluate contrary evidence helps them seek it out. It doesn’t always change their minds, but it slows down the rush to confirmation. A well-timed “<em>What would change your view on this?</em>” can do more than a dozen balanced suggestions buried in the output.</p><h4><strong>Conversational pushback</strong></h4><p>For chatbots specifically, the occasional probing can feel like respect rather than resistance. “<em>That’s an interesting angle, but have you considered X?</em>” or “<em>I notice you’re assuming Y, is that right?</em>” These aren’t disagreements. They’re the kind of questions a thoughtful colleague would ask.</p><p>The goal isn’t to frustrate users. It’s to keep them in the loop rather than letting the loop run without them.</p><h3>The balancing act</h3><p>There’s an obvious tension here. Speed bumps can frustrate. Too much pushback and users will abandon the product entirely. The goal isn’t to make every interaction feel like a debate.</p><p>The key is matching friction to stakes.</p><p><strong>Low-stakes interactions can stay smooth. </strong>Playlist recommendations, auto-complete, casual suggestions. These don’t need a contrarian voice. Users aren’t making life-altering decisions when they ask for a recipe or a movie recommendation.</p><p><strong>High-stakes decisions are different. </strong>Medical assessments, hiring choices, financial planning, legal research. These deserve a pause. A moment where the interface asks: <em>are you sure? Have you considered this? Here’s what might go wrong.</em></p><p>The art is in knowing where the line falls. And that line will be different for every product.</p><figure><img alt=""Infographic showing a spectrum from low stakes to high stakes.

A chatbot helping someone assess a job candidate probably should. The same system might need different friction levels depending on what the user is trying to do.</p><p>This isn’t about making chatbots less helpful. It’s about making them helpful in the right way. A system that agrees with everything feels supportive in the moment, but it doesn’t make users better at thinking. A system that occasionally pushes back, asks hard questions, and surfaces alternatives might feel slightly less comfortable. But it builds something more valuable: users who stay sharp even when the AI is switched off.</p><h3>Where this leaves us</h3><p>The echo chamber problem in conversational interfaces isn’t a bug to be patched. It’s baked into how these systems are trained and how users respond to them.</p><p>When the goal is user satisfaction, agreement becomes the path of least resistance. And agreement, repeated often enough, stops being helpful. It becomes a mirror that only shows users what they already believe.</p><p>But there’s a way out. The same research that uncovered the feedback loop also showed that well-designed tools can improve human judgement rather than erode it. Friction isn’t the enemy of good UX. Thoughtless smoothness is.</p><p>The patterns in this piece are within reach. Transparency about uncertainty. Surfacing counterarguments. Prompts that make users pause before they commit. None of this requires rebuilding your product from scratch. It requires deciding that keeping users sharp matters as much as keeping them happy.</p><p>The best conversational interfaces won’t just tell people what they want to hear. They’ll help them think.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Thanks for reading! 📖</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote><em>If you liked this post, </em><a href=""https://medium.com/@doracee""><em>follow me on Medium</em></a><em> for more.</em></blockquote><h3>References &amp; Credits</h3><ul><li>Glickman, M., &amp; Sharot, T.

It has been widely considered the ultimate proxy for engagement and a key indicator of early signs of product-market fit for software companies.</p><p>That’s because DAU/WAU/MAU are used to calculate key metrics such as user retention (e.g. the classics <a href=""https://amplitude.com/books/mastering-retention/the-retention-lifecycle-framework"">30-day retention</a> and <a href=""https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/what-is-good-retention-issue-29"">12-month retention</a> metrics) as well as stickyness (e.g. the <a href=""https://posthog.com/tutorials/dau-mau-ratio"">DAU/MAU Ratio</a> that measures the proportion of monthly users of a product who engage with it daily) and many more important metrics to measure how well a software product or service is performing.</p><p>But this model, built on the premise of a human directly interacting with a graphical user interface, is becoming a dangerously misleading measure of a product’s true value.

The theoretical hype of previous years has finally materialized into a <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/seizing-the-agentic-ai-advantage"">tangible</a> <a href=""https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-07-10-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-end-user-spending-on-generative-ai-models-to-total-us-dollars-14-billion-in-2025"">market</a> <a href=""https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/ai-analytics/ai-predictions.html"">shift</a> in 2025. Last year, venture capital poured <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-03/ai-is-dominating-2025-vc-investing-pulling-in-192-7-billion"">billions</a> into AI, with companies at all layers of the stack commanding massive valuations. Despite <a href=""https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf"">sobering findings</a> on the value of AI in the first half of 2025, the technology has quickly caught up and improved dramatically.</p><p>The tipping point arrived in early 2026 with a series of hardware-native and “computer-use” releases that moved AI from a chat box to a virtual colleague. In January 2026, Anthropic launched <em>Claude Cowork</em>, a desktop agent capable of performing multi-step tasks natively across local files and third-party applications. This was quickly followed by the release of <em>Claude Opus 4.6</em> in February, which set a new industry record on the <a href=""https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/gdpval-aa"">GDPval-AA benchmark</a> and the <a href=""https://arcprize.org/"">ARC-AGI benchmark</a> — evaluation benchmarks specifically designed to measure the performance and “intelligence” of AI models. Google released <em>Gemini 3.1</em> Pro shortly after in late February 2026 — achieving a record high score on the <a href=""https://arcprize.org/leaderboard"">ARC-AGI-2 benchmark</a>, and more than doubling the reasoning performance of the Gemini 3 series from just a year prior. These gains in “core intelligence” mean agents no longer just follow instructions; they can now solve entirely new logic patterns and manage autonomous workflows with minimal human oversight.</p><p>However, this “agentic summer” has come with a heavy price for legacy tech. In early February 2026, the introduction of these autonomous workflows triggered what analysts called the <strong>“SaaS-pocalypse”</strong> — a massive, sudden sell-off in software stocks. Investors, fearing that autonomous agents would replace “per-seat” licensing models, <a href=""https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/us/why-anthropics-claude-cowork-sparked-300-billion-tech-market-sell-off-this-month-see-which-sectors-are-winning-and-losing-amid-ai-boom/articleshow/128122187.cms"">wiped out nearly $300 billion in market value</a> in a matter of days.</p><p>The “Black Tuesday for Software” (February 3, 2026) remains the largest single-day valuation reset for the SaaS sector in history. Giants like Salesforce and Adobe saw <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmarkman/2026/02/16/the-brutal-pace-of-ai-that-just-wiped-300-billion-off-software-stocks/"">historic one-day drops</a> as the market began to revalue software not as a tool for humans, but as a utility for AI agents.</p><p>The conversation in boardrooms and on tech stages has pivoted decisively from <em>“what is generative AI?”</em> to <em>“what is our agentic strategy?” </em>So what are AI agents anyway? Everyone seems to <a href=""https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/agents"">have</a> <a href=""https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents"">their</a> <a href=""https://docs.mistral.ai/agents/agents_introduction/"">own</a> definitions with slight differences.</p><figure><img alt=""Dan Ariely’s infamous quote about Big Data in 2017 is very applicable to AI Agents in 2025"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_v-i-e-sADsU5kiiyDGxjQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://danariely.com/"">Dan Ariely</a>’s infamous quote about Big Data in 2017 is very applicable to AI Agents in 2025</figcaption></figure><p>In the context discussed below, AI agents — or simply agents—are described as pieces of software that are programmed in natural language through a prompt executed by a Large Language Model (LLM) to autonomously or semi-autonomously process data and/or execute actions in a given software applications.</p><p>Think of AI agents as digital interns you can instruct with natural language. You give them a high-level goal — like <em>“find VC-backed startups building propulsion systems for nano and micro-satellites, compile a report comparing their technology’s strengths and weaknesses, then post a link to Slack when you’re done”</em> — and the agent uses all the tools is has available (e.g., web search, CRM data, Slack API, etc.) to figure out the steps and get the job done. It’s this ability to act on our behalf that is fundamentally changing how we interact with technology. It’s the fact that pieces of software are now able to understand how to carry on a different task, plan the work, identify a set of tools to carry a given sub-task, and execute it all end-to-end.</p><p>It’s also important to recognize a critical distinction: AI agents fall into two primary categories.</p><p><strong>Internal Agents: The Product Enhancers <br /></strong>Internal agents are those built <em>by</em> the software company itself to operate within <em>their</em> product. For example, Salesforce <a href=""https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/einstein-service-agent-announcement/"">Einstein Service Agent</a>, Intercom <a href=""https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/7120684-fin-ai-agent-explained"">Fin</a>, or Microsoft <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot"">Copilot</a> in Microsoft 365. These first-party agents are designed to enrich the native product experience and are often a key part of a premium feature set or add-on.</p><figure><img alt=""Example: Anatomy of a Sidekick — Miro AI Agent"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_OgblhvLFrV54kuPSvj1VA.png"" /><figcaption>Example: Anatomy of a Sidekick — Miro AI Agent</figcaption></figure><p>As an example, the figure above showcases the high-level architecture of a <a href=""https://miro.com/ai/sidekicks/"">Sidekick</a>: Miro’s AI agent designed to run natively in the Miro platform (which was released on October 14 at <a href=""https://miro.com/blog/canvas-25-top-ten-product-highlights/"">Canvas25</a>).</p><p>A Sidekick agent is able to tap into data (knowledge) that it uses as context to assist users with their jobs-to-be-done. The knowledge it uses can be internal to the Miro environment (i.e. content and visual context on a Miro board, information retrieved through <a href=""https://insights.miro.com/"">Miro Insights</a>) or external (i.e. search information on the web, or retrieve business knowledge if the user has an active integration with something like <em>Gemini Enterpris</em>e or <em>Amazon Q</em>). Sidekicks can execute actions through a set of tools that it has access to (e.g. <a href=""https://miro.com/prototyping/"">generate a mobile app prototype</a>, create sticky notes, write a doc, generate a flow chart technical diagram, etc.). Users can use pre-made Sidekicks or create their own custom virtual assistants through prompting.</p><p><strong>External Agents: The Ecosystem Creator<br /></strong>External agents are built <em>by third parties</em> — your customers, other startups, or independent developers — who use your public API and <a href=""https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro"">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a> server to interact with your software from the outside. In other worlds, these agents are never designed nor built by the software companies as a way to elevate their core product experience. These are instead built by a wider users’ community to automate their workflow and extend the surface areas for leveraging a given software in their tool set.</p><p>In the illustration below, a developer using <em>Cursor</em> can tap into <a href=""https://miro.com/ai/mcp/"">Miro’s MCP server</a> to use Miro boards as rich context to accelerate development and translate the outcomes of ideation sessions and workshops into production code faster.</p><figure><img alt=""Connecting your product to AI tools through Model Context Protocol (MCP)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*V49LOxhnZKmZ3pndMSXZ-Q.png"" /><figcaption>Connecting your product to AI tools through Model Context Protocol (MCP)</figcaption></figure><p>While the positive growth rate of internal agents is a positive signal that a given product is extending its value to customers, the growth of <strong>external agents is the ultimate validation of your platform’s value</strong>. An active external agent represents a deep, institutional commitment. It means a customer has invested their own engineering resources to build custom logic on top of your service. It proves that your platform is viewed as a fundamental piece of infrastructure that is so valuable that the market is building its own tools and businesses around it.</p><p>Usage growth of internal agents shows you’re building a better <em>product</em>; usage growth of external agents shows you’re building an <em>ecosystem</em>. The latter is the true indicator of a defensible long-term position.</p><h3>The Real User Journey is Changing: From Operator to Delegator</h3><p>The arrival of agents doesn’t mean that they replace humans, but rather augment them. Human users will continue to be the drivers and initiators of work, but their primary point of interaction will shift away from the myriad of SaaS graphical user interfaces they use today and consolidate into a single interface: their AI agent.</p><p>Think about the following workflow:</p><ol><li>A developer just implemented a fix for a bug, and needs to update the progress status of the bug ticket.</li><li>They stop what they’re doing, open a new tab, and log into their project management software.</li><li>They navigate through the UI to find the right project and ticket.</li><li>They make the update, leave a comment, and close the tab.</li></ol><p>This entire process generates a “Daily Active User” event.</p><p>Now consider the new, agent-powered workflow:</p><ol><li>An engineer tells their AI assistant (via voice or text): “Hey, fix this bug please, and update the ticket so the GTM team can communicate to customers.”</li><li>The AI agent write a fix for the bug through <em>Claude Code, Codex</em>, or <em>Mistral Code</em>, the developer review and approves, then the agent automatically pushes the PR, then authenticates through the MCP server of the project management software, to autonomously executes a set of actions to move the bug ticket to “Done”, confirms completion, and then post an update to the GTM team on Slack.</li></ol><p>The human user never logged in. The DAU is zero for that interaction. Yet, the same — or even more — value was created. The user is still active, but their activity is now proxied through an agent.</p><p>We are moving from a world where the human is the central router of information — manually context-switching between <em>Miro</em>, <em>Google Slides</em>, <em>Amplitude</em>, <em>Figma</em>, and <em>Jira</em> — to one where the human sits behind an autonomous AI-powered intermediary. In the new “Agentic Era,” the human provides the high-level goal, while the Agent becomes the primary “consumer” of the software’s interface.</p><blockquote>“Oh no, I love the beautiful UI and dead simple UX of Jira and Workday!” — <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28257866"">said</a> <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40273637"">no</a> <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1j2ng9f/how_is_workday_still_a_70_billion_company_with/"">one</a> <a href=""https://community.atlassian.com/forums/Jira-questions/Why-does-Atlassian-struggle-so-much-when-creating-a-user/qaq-p/905992"">ever</a>.</blockquote><p>This is a great news, isn’t it?</p><p>This transformation will be most profound for SaaS products that act as a <strong>system of record (SoR)</strong>. For tools like Jira, Salesforce, HubSpot, Workday, or GitHub, the ultimate value isn’t the time users spend clicking around in the interface; it’s the accuracy, timeliness, and completeness of the data <em>within</em> the system. When an AI agent can update Salesforce with meeting notes, create a new branch in GitHub, or pull a report from HubSpot programmatically, the system of record becomes more valuable and more integrated than ever before, all while human logins decline.</p><h3>The New Gold Standard: Tracking Programmatic Value 🤖</h3><p>The users of SaaS software aren’t going to be humans anymore. As such, measuring human interactions as a key performance indicator is no longer the most reliable measure of value — we need a new set of metrics that reflect this new reality.</p><ul><li><strong>Daily Active Agents (DAA):</strong> The number of unique, authenticated AI agents making meaningful API/MCP calls to your platform each day (both internal + external agents).</li><li><strong>Weekly Active Agents (WAA):</strong> The number of unique agents interacting with your platform in a given week.</li><li><strong>Monthly Active Agents (MAA):</strong> The number of unique agents active on a monthly basis.</li></ul><p>Each “Active Agent” is a force multiplier, representing a human user or an entire team whose productivity is being scaled programmatically.</p><figure><img alt=""Compounding effects of Al Agents on product usage"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZTgd5dKlxsEq_3qkbUdhdQ.png"" /><figcaption>Compounding effects of Al Agents on product usage</figcaption></figure><p>In the figure above, I showcase a very conservative scenario to illustrate the compounding effects of AI agents to compare product usage of 2 hypothetical companies.</p><p>On one hand, we have <em>Company A. Company A </em>is growing very fast (MAU growing 5% week-over-week or about 20% month-over-month) and doesn’t launch any agent-ready connectors or solution.</p><p>On the other hand, we have <em>Company B</em>. <em>Company B </em>is growing a lot slower than <em>Company A</em> (MAU growing 2.5% week-over-week or about 10% month-over-month). However, <em>Company B</em> launches agent-ready connectors in its product on Month 6. The rules of the algorithm behind the data are as follows:</p><ul><li>Only 25% of total MAU adopt the agent solution from Month 6 to Month 12.</li><li>In Month 6, 25% of MAU uses 1 agent per month and their agent usage grows by +1 per month. By Month 12, 25% of MAU uses 7 agents per month.</li><li>Each AI agent triggers 1.5 other AI agents per month on average.</li></ul><p>Even with this conservative adoption scenario, you can see that <em>Company B’s</em> MAA takes over <em>Company A’s</em> MAU in just 2 months on Month 8. At Month 12, <em>Company B’s</em> MAA is about 2x <em>Company A’s</em> MAU.</p><p>This a conservative illustrative example and it’s crucial to understand that the <em>scale</em> of these new metrics operates on a completely different plane. While one human represents a single user, that same human could delegate tasks <strong>to hundreds or even thousands</strong> of autonomous AI agents simultaneously. This creates a massive divergence in growth trajectories. A mature SaaS product might see its human-centric Monthly Active Users grow by a respectable 1% month-over-month. However, as its customers begin deploying agents, its <strong>Monthly Active Agents could explode, growing at an exponential rate of 25% month-over-month.</strong> This is the difference between measuring linear adoption and measuring exponential, programmatic integration.</p><p>Tracking MAA gives you a direct line of sight into how your product is creating value at scale and how deeply it is embedded into your customers’ core, automated workflows.</p><h3>What does this mean for Product-Market Fit? 🎯</h3><p>For years, founders have proven Product-Market Fit with two key methods. The first is the DAU/MAU ratio, a quick pulse check on overall user stickiness. The second, and arguably the more powerful indicator, is <strong>cohort retention</strong>. The ultimate proof of PMF was seeing the retention curve for a new user cohort — say, everyone who signed up in January — flatten out over 30, 60, and 90 days. A flattening curve was the gold-standard signal that you had built something people truly needed.</p><p>But in a world where AI agents are the primary interactors, both of these human-centric metrics become unreliable. A human user might delegate all their tasks to an agent and stop logging in, causing their cohort to look like it’s churned when, in reality, their engagement with the product has actually deepened.</p><p>This calls for a direct evolution of our best metrics. Product-Market Fit is no longer about user cohorts; it’s about <strong>agent cohort retention</strong>.</p><p>The new key question becomes: “Of the new agents that were activated on our platform in January, what percentage are still active 30, 60, and 90 days later?”</p><p>This is a profoundly more powerful metric. A human user might churn because they change jobs, their team reorganizes, or they simply forget to log in. An agent, however, only “churns” when a company makes a deliberate, high-effort decision to rip out an integration and re-architect a core automated process. The friction to churn is greater.</p><p>Therefore, seeing a flattening <strong>agent retention curve</strong> is the new, unequivocal signal of deep, structural Product-Market Fit. It proves your platform has been successfully embedded not just into a person’s workflow, but into a company’s foundational, automated infrastructure.</p><p>Therefore, a high AI agent retention is a far stronger and more resilient signal of true, durable Product-Market Fit than human logins ever were.</p><figure><img alt=""Meme Product-Market Fit in the AI era"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g0g9TPyH55839t_fEZMl6g.png"" /><figcaption>Meme Product-Market Fit in the AI era</figcaption></figure><h3>What does this mean for monetization? 💰</h3><p>The agent-driven future will cause the <strong>seat-based pricing model to completely fall on its head</strong>. This is one of the root cause behind the <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/global-software-stocks-hit-by-anthropic-wake-up-call-ai-disruption-2026-02-04/"">“SaaS-pocalypse” in early February 2026</a>.</p><p>For decades, SaaS revenue has been a simple multiplication: number of users times price per seat. But if a single human can deploy 100 AI agents to do the work of 100 interns, what is a “seat”?</p><p>For incumbents, this presents a classic <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/The-Innovators-Dilemma-Technologies-Cause/dp/0875845851""><strong>Innovator’s Dilemma</strong></a>. Think about a company like <em>Adobe</em>. Their success is built on serving and charging for their core audience: creatives and designers paying a monthly seat price.</p><p>Imagine that a given enterprise customer build a suite of designer agents that can connect to Adobe’s products to auto-generate design proposals at scale, assist human designers to expedite design reviews, etc. (or a startup build a AI agent solution to do this)</p><p>This given enterprise customer is paying for 200 designer seats and is now able to achieve the same outcome with only 50 designer seats using 1000 agents. It’s easy to see how the seat-based pricing model completely collapses as AI agents are increasingly deeply integrated within SaaS products.</p><p>This dilemma is precisely why the old model is unsustainable. This paradigm shift forces a move toward consumption-based pricing or a totally different model. The future of SaaS monetization is not about charging for access, but about charging for the <em>value created</em>. New models will become the norm:</p><ul><li><strong>Per-Agent:</strong> Charging per unique active agent connected to the platform per month as a direct replacement to the seat-based model.</li><li><strong>Usage-Based:</strong> Pricing per API call, per task completed, or per gigabyte of data processed.</li><li><strong>Value-Metric:</strong> Tying the price to a clear business outcome (e.g., number of leads processed for a CRM, number of incidents resolved for a support tool, number of workflow executed).</li></ul><p>This transition is not just a financial necessity; it’s a healthier model that aligns a vendor’s success more directly with the success of its customers.</p><p>If you swap Adobe for Figma in the example above, the <a href=""https://x.com/aakashgupta/status/2018919731550617992"">disruption is even more dramatic</a>: it’s not just the pricing model that’s crumbling, it’s the disruption of the workflow itself. Designers, developers, and PMs, are increasingly moving to AI and vibe coding tools to do prototyping and <a href=""https://x.com/hvpandya/status/2013240464879894786"">designs directly in code</a> — making the traditional design-to-handoff process (and Figma) increasingly redundant. Figma’s response has been one of cautious protectionism; their initial MCP server was artificially limited to “read-only” in a clear attempt to prevent the cannibalization of their core user base. Even with the release of the <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-claude-code-to-figma/"">Claude Code-Figma integration</a>, the ability for agents to actually <em>create</em> within Figma remains gated behind a strict paywall and with limits. To the market, these limitations feel like a desperate moat — and investors remain deeply concerned about the long-term risk of <a href=""https://fortune.com/2026/02/18/fig-stock-q4-earnings/"">letting the “agentic fox” into the human-seat hen house</a>.</p><h3>What This Means for Startups and VCs 📈</h3><p>It’s a fundamental shift in strategy. Your user (and your buyer) is still a human, but your <em>primary interface</em> is now their agent.</p><p>This requires a foundational change in how we build products. As <a href=""https://karpathy.ai/"">Andrej Karpathy</a> recently put it, companies that fail to adapt are putting themselves at significant risk. He argues that for true human-AI collaboration to flourish, products must be built for programmatic access first.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/418c8723a200130628017963259697e6/href"">https://medium.com/media/418c8723a200130628017963259697e6/href</a><blockquote>“Products with extensive/rich UIs lots of sliders, switches, menus, with no scripting support, and built on opaque, custom, binary formats are Not Gonna Make It in the era of heavy human+AI collaboration.</blockquote><blockquote>If an LLM can’t read the underlying representations and manipulate them and all of the related settings via scripting, then it also can’t co-pilot your product with existing professionals and it doesn’t allow vibe coding for the 100X more aspiring prosumers.”</blockquote><blockquote>- Andrej Karpathy</blockquote><p>His warning is clear. If your platform is a black box that can only be manipulated through a human clicking buttons, you are building a legacy product. If you’re doing this deliberately to safe-guard your seat-based business model, you’ll get disrupted anyway, and probably faster than you realize.</p><p><strong>For Startups &amp; SaaS Companies:</strong> The call to action is to prioritize the <strong>“Agent Experience”</strong> (AX):</p><ul><li><strong>Your API is your new UI:</strong> It must be robust, well-documented, and expressive. This is what enables an AI to become a “co-pilot” for your human users. And who knows: just like “User Experience” (UX) gave rise to a number of specialized jobs (i.e. User Experience Designer, User Experience Researcher), perhaps the need for optimized “Agent Experience” (AX) will also give rise to a similar set of new jobs</li><li><strong>Embrace text-based, scriptable formats:</strong> The easier it is for an LLM to read, understand, and manipulate the core objects of your product, the more valuable your product becomes. Furthermore, because LLMs have been trained on internet data, they are exceptional at understanding information serialized as an HTML DOM. If you can represent your software interface as a DOM, you’re already halfway there.</li><li><strong>Don’t wait for AI to master your UI:</strong> Karpathy warns, <em>“…products that attempt to exclusively wait for this future without trying to meet the technology halfway where it is today are not going to have a good time.”</em> You must build for the programmatic reality of today. At Miro, we’re introducing the concept of <em>Miro Turing Test</em> internally. The test is passed when agents can use the totality of Miro to the point where human users wouldn’t be able to tell they are collaborating with an AI agent on the canvas (theoretically not practically).</li><li><strong>Build a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server:</strong> A great API is paramount, and the next step is an <a href=""https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro"">MCP server</a>. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect electronic devices, and REST APIs provides a standardized way to connect websites and web apps on the web, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI applications to systems. Building an MCP server means designing your programmatic interface specifically for LLM consumption. While a traditional API serves data, an MCP serves <em>context </em>and expose <em>tools. </em>It provides clear, machine-readable function definitions, prompts, examples, and constraints that an LLM can understand natively, dramatically reducing the effort for an agent to reliably learn and use your tool.</li></ul><p><strong>For Venture Capitalists:</strong> Your due diligence must evolve to look past the vanity metric of human logins and shallow activity:</p><ul><li>The crucial question becomes: <em>“Show me your agent engagement. How scriptable is your platform? How many customers are connecting to your platform through MCP?”</em></li><li>Monthly Active Agents (MAA) is not a replacement for human value; it is a <em>multiplier</em>. A high MAA is the ultimate validation of product-market fit in the AI era.</li></ul><p>The future of software isn’t a world without users. It’s a world where users are super-powered by AI agents who do the tedious work for them. The companies that thrive will be those that embrace this shift and build for the delegator, not just the operator.</p><p>So, are you still measuring how many people use your product, or are you measuring how deeply your platform is integrated into the AI ecosystem?</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=f7f556cb8125"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/your-users-arent-human-anymore-start-building-for-agents-today-f7f556cb8125"">Your users aren’t human anymore; start building for agents today</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>AI coding tools are rewriting who gets to make software. The question isn’t whether that’s good. It’s what it does to the things we use every day.</h4><p>In 2023, a controlled study found that developers using GitHub Copilot completed a coding task <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06590"">55% faster</a> than those without it. That’s your 4-week sprint becoming a 2-week sprint.</p><p>By 2025, <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/06/a-quarter-of-startups-in-ycs-current-cohort-have-codebases-that-are-almost-entirely-ai-generated/"">25% of Y Combinator’s Winter batch</a> had codebases that were 95% AI-generated.

The <a href=""https://www.secondtalent.com/resources/ai-coding-assistant-statistics/"">AI code generation market</a> hit $4.91 billion.</p><p>Thanks for reading Built for People! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.</p><p>A UX designer in an academic study said it best: <a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2509.10652v1"">“What used to take me hours, I can now do in two minutes with AI.”</a></p><p>Everyone celebrated the democratisation of software. And rightly so. But here’s the thing nobody’s spending enough time on: <strong>the constraints that made software expensive also shaped the experience of using it.</strong></p><p>Remove the constraint, and you don’t just get faster software. You get <em>more</em> software. The question is whether more is better — or just more.</p><h3>The old world: when software was precious</h3><p>Let me paint you a picture of product management in 2021.</p><p>You’re a PM at a fintech. You have 6 engineers. US-based senior developers cost <a href=""https://stssoftware.com/blog/software-development-hourly-rates/"">$150–$200 per hour</a>, and when you factor in benefits, recruitment, and overhead, the true cost of a fully employed engineer runs roughly <a href=""https://neontri.com/blog/software-development-costs/"">2.7x their base salary</a>.</p><p>Every sprint is a zero-sum game. Every feature you build means something else you don’t.</p><p>The ritual goes like this: spend 3 days writing a PRD nobody fully reads. Two design review cycles. A stakeholder alignment meeting. At least one “can we push this to next quarter?” Get engineering estimates that are optimistic by 40%. Build anyway. Ship late. Celebrate like you conquered something.</p><p>The process was slow and annoying. But it had a hidden benefit: <strong>it was a quality filter.</strong></p><p>The pain of getting anything built meant only things worth building got built. Everything had to survive interrogation. ROI calculations. Stakeholder scepticism. Engineering capacity constraints.</p><p>Internal tooling? Almost never.</p><p>At Wise, a globally scaled fintech where I worked back then, building tools for operations teams was notoriously difficult — not because it was technically hard, but because engineering resources were too scarce to point at anything that didn’t directly move a customer-facing metric.</p><p>The ops team needed a custom dashboard? Great idea. Back of the queue behind the 11 customer-facing features committed in Q1.</p><p>Software was expensive, so you built less and built it well.</p><figure><img alt=""GIF of the jealous girlfriend"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/962/0*gKXmYpyUHmNA9ft1.png"" /></figure><h3>Enter the Vibe coders</h3><p>In February 2025, Andrej Karpathy — former head of AI at Tesla, co-founder of OpenAI — coined the term “<a href=""https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383"">vibe coding</a>.” Describe what you want in plain English. Let the AI write the code. Don’t even look at it (although you should).</p><p>A Meta PM named Zevi Arnovitz, who described himself as someone who finds code “terrifying,” told <a href=""https://lennysvault.com/insights/leadership-perspectives/11e6d6b8-1ca7-4fca-b5f8-bd735cfaf8e3"">Lenny’s Podcast</a> that AI coding tools felt like being handed “superpowers.” He rebuilt his entire workflow using Cursor and Claude — no engineering background, shipping features independently.</p><p>Figma CEO Dylan Field noted that designers, engineers, PMs, and researchers were all starting to <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/figma-ceo-job-titles-merging-everyone-product-builder-2025-10"">“dip their toe into other roles.”</a> The walls between disciplines were dissolving.</p><p>Meanwhile, one designer summarised what this felt like in practice: <a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2509.10652v1"">“From ideas in my head to ideas I can see. It’s like having a thought partner to explore, learn, and debug with.”</a></p><p>If software used to be an expensive, scarce resource, it just became abundant and cheap.</p><p>So what happens to the user experience when the cost of building drops to near zero?</p><h3>The Michelin-Star problem</h3><p>Here’s the mental model that changed how I think about this.</p><p>Every great chef will tell you the same thing: the hardest part isn’t cooking. It’s deciding what <em>not</em> to put on the plate.</p><p>Joël Robuchon — the most Michelin-starred chef in history with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo%C3%ABl_Robuchon"">32 stars at his peak</a> — was famous for a dish of three ingredients, plated so precisely the kitchen would redo it if a garnish sat one millimetre off.</p><p>Compare that to a diner with a laminated 200-item menu. More options. Worse food. The menu isn’t generous — it’s just unedited.</p><p>When building is expensive, you’re forced to be Robuchon. When building is free, the temptation is to become the diner.</p><p>The constraint wasn’t just slowing you down. It was making you good.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*EI5NQvmuq4Bab_fl.png"" /></figure><h3>What cheap software actually unlocks</h3><p>Let’s start with the upside, because it’s genuinely massive — and it’s not where most people are looking.</p><p><strong>1. The internal tools revolution.</strong></p><p>Remember the Wise ops team? That dashboard request that died in the backlog — not because it was bad, but because a senior engineer costs <a href=""https://stssoftware.com/blog/software-development-hourly-rates/"">$150–$200 an hour</a> and the dashboard couldn’t compete for sprint slots against customer-facing features?</p><p>Today, that ops manager can build it in an afternoon using <a href=""https://www.getproductpeople.com/blog/introduction-to-vibe-coding-for-product-managers-from-idea-to-mvp"">Lovable, Bolt, or v0.dev</a>. No sprint slot. No ROI calculation. No stakeholder approval. Done.</p><p>Software stopped being a bottleneck for operational efficiency. The internal tools that lived in PowerPoint decks for years are becoming real. And this is happening in a context where the quality bar is naturally lower, the stakes of failure are contained, and users are forgiving colleagues. Perfect fit.</p><p><strong>2. Prototyping goes from days to minutes.</strong></p><p>This is the one designers should care about most.</p><p>A <a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2509.10652v1"">study of 20 UX professionals</a> published in 2025 found that vibe coding fundamentally changed how designers test ideas. Instead of spending days building a static mockup in Figma, they were generating working prototypes in minutes — complete with real interactions, real data flows, and real feedback loops.</p><p>One participant described it as overcoming <a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2509.10652v1"">“whiteboard fear”</a> — the paralysis of starting from a blank canvas. AI gave them a starting point they could refine instead of a void they had to fill.</p><p>Product designer Kshitij Agrawal summarised the shift perfectly: <a href=""https://www.uxtigers.com/post/vibe-coding-vibe-design"">“Mockups existed because coding was difficult. Now that coding is easy, the future is prototypes.”</a></p><p>Think about what that means for UX research. Instead of testing a static Figma flow and asking users to imagine how it would work, you can test <em>the actual thing</em>. The feedback is richer. The iteration is faster. The gap between what you designed and what users experience collapses.</p><p><strong>3. The designer-developer wall dissolves.</strong></p><p>Smashing Magazine described the new paradigm: designers are becoming <a href=""https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2025/09/intent-prototyping-pure-vibe-coding-enterprise-ux/"">“design engineers”</a>, using AI tools to add not just visual styles but basic functionality to UI components — without programming skills. The deliverable is changing from a spec document to an actual working element.</p><p>For the first time, the person who understands the user can also build the thing. That’s a powerful loop.</p><figure><img alt=""Workflow illusration"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*rpOR0_XSJxvOO1yk.png"" /></figure><h3>But here’s what happens to the user experience</h3><p>All of this speed is extraordinary. The risk isn’t that the tools are bad. It’s that they make it trivially easy to build things that shouldn’t exist.</p><p><strong>The pixel-perfect trap.</strong></p><p>A UI/UX designer at agency COAX described the core problem: <a href=""https://coaxsoft.com/blog/whats-wrong-with-vibe-coding"">“An AI-generated form looked perfect in Figma but failed basic usability tests. It had no validation, poor error states, and confusing navigation.”</a></p><p>This is the signature failure mode of AI-generated interfaces. They look polished — beautiful layouts, consistent spacing, professional typography. But they’re missing the invisible layer that makes software <em>work</em>: error handling, edge cases, loading states, accessibility, and the dozens of micro-decisions that come from actually watching someone use the thing.</p><p>AI builds from patterns. It doesn’t build from empathy.</p><p><strong>The Spotify problem.</strong></p><p>You don;’t need a history lesson to see what unconstrained feature-building does to a product. Just open Spotify.</p><p>It launched as a music app. One job, done brilliantly. Then it added podcasts, audiobooks, AI playlists, AI-generated music, social features, TikTok-style video clips, and a live events marketplace. Each addition made strategic sense in isolation. Together, they turned a music player into something users increasingly describe as <a href=""https://community.spotify.com/t5/Social-Random/Spotify-s-UI-Needs-a-Redesign-It-s-Cluttered-Messy-and/td-p/6690860"">cluttered and confusing</a>.</p><p>The Spotify Community forums read like a UX case study in what happens when “can we build it?” replaces “should we?” One user in <a href=""https://community.spotify.com/t5/Social-Random/App-Interface-is-Entirely-Broken/td-p/6650155"">another thread</a> put it plainly: “I will never use the audiobooks features. I will never use the podcasts features. I only care about music. Making your app more confusing in hopes that I stumble upon an audiobook or podcast is incomprehensibly stupid.”</p><p>Spotify added audiobooks partly because of a<a href=""https://www.howtogeek.com/apps-everyones-complaining-about-2025/""> 2022 legal settlement</a> allowed bundled services to pay lower royalties to musicians. The feature wasn’t built for users. It was built for the business model. Users got a more cluttered app as a side effect.</p><figure><img alt=""Spotify over time"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*J1dvZjUVvjpu22hT.png"" /></figure><p>Spotify evolution over time</p><p>This is the Evernote trajectory in real time. (Evernote pulled the same move a decade ago — expanded from notes into business cards, presentations, work chat, and eventually <a href=""https://iamreliable.com/the-system-that-failed-evernotes-growth/"">a marketplace selling socks and backpacks</a>. Downloads <a href=""https://www.makeuseof.com/what-happened-to-evernote/"">collapsed 82%</a>. Its new owners spent their first year stripping features to return to basics.)</p><figure><img alt=""Evernote downloads vs new features"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*MUjgyOiNwo2bogBH.png"" /></figure><p>And neither company even had AI coding tools. Every feature they added required real engineering time. Imagine what happens when adding a feature costs nothing.</p><h3>The state of UX saw this coming</h3><p>The <a href=""https://trends.uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective’s State of UX 2025</a> diagnosed the moment with uncomfortable clarity.</p><p>Their observation: teams are <a href=""https://trends.uxdesign.cc"">“optimizing flows for clicks, not clarity”</a> and have <a href=""https://trends.uxdesign.cc"">“stopped building tools and started building engagement traps.”</a> Designers are spending their days in stakeholder alignment meetings rather than doing design work. Products get launched because someone needs a promotion. Timelines are built around performance reviews.</p><p>They described an industry that was already drifting toward feature bloat <em>before</em> AI made building free. Add vibe coding to this culture, and the incentive to ship more — without asking whether more is better — only intensifies.</p><p>The <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-reset-2025/"">NN Group’s UX Reckoning piece</a> put the positive frame on it: this is the moment where curated taste, research-informed judgment, and critical thinking become the differentiating skills. Not because they’re trendy — but because they’re the things AI genuinely can’t do.</p><p>Jakob Nielsen himself noted that by Q3 2025, <a href=""https://www.uxtigers.com/post/ux-roundup-20251222"">“the era of pixel-pushing had effectively ended for commercial production”</a> — tools like Figma AI and v0 could generate high-fidelity UI from text prompts. But he also observed that this made UX <em>more</em> important, not less: someone still needs to decide what to build, for whom, and why.</p><h3>Who wins. Who loses.</h3><p>The loser is any team whose answer to “can we build it?” is always “yes.” The Evernote trajectory awaits.</p><p>The winner is any team that uses the speed for the right things — rapid prototyping, internal tooling, faster research loops — while maintaining the discipline to ask, for every customer-facing feature: <em>does this respect the user’s attention?</em></p><p>The <a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2509.10652v1"">academic study of UX professionals</a> found exactly this tension. They called it the gap between “intending the right design” (using AI to build faster) and “designing the right intention” (knowing what to build in the first place). Speed only helps if you’ve already answered the second question.</p><p>There’s an old product design saying that’s about to become the most important sentence in every team’s vocabulary: <strong>the best feature is the one you decide not to build.</strong></p><h3>The opportunity</h3><p>Product management and UX design have always had an awkward relationship with engineering constraints. Those constraints were frustrating. They were also making you better.</p><p>Now the constraint is gone. So the designer, the PM, the researcher — they need to become the new constraint.</p><p>Not by slowing things down. By using the speed for prototyping, testing, and internal tools — and holding the line on what ships to users.</p><p>For the first time, the person closest to the user can also build the prototype, test it with real people, and iterate in hours instead of weeks. The designer doesn’t need to wait for engineering. The PM doesn’t need to write a spec and hope it gets interpreted correctly. The researcher can go from insight to testable prototype in an afternoon.</p><p>This is a great opportunity, but only if the industry resists the temptation to treat speed as the goal rather than the tool. <strong>When building is cheap, restraint becomes the most valuable thing a team can practise.</strong></p><p>The teams that figure this out will build the next generation of things people actually love.</p><p>The rest will spend the next decade undoing what they built this year.</p><p>Thanks for reading Built for People!

Six months later, they were using it themselves.</p><p>The term captured something genuinely unprecedented: a new generation of tools that let anyone — designers, marketers, founders, students — describe an app in plain English and watch it get built in real time.

But the real action clusters around a handful of names that keep appearing in developer Slack channels, Reddit threads, and YC pitch decks. Here is what they actually are, who built them, and what their real numbers look like:</p><h4><strong>Lovable</strong> — No-code king</h4><p>Stockholm-born. Built for non-technical founders. Describe your app in plain English; Lovable builds a full-stack React + Supabase app with shareable URL, GitHub sync, and one-click deploy. The go-to for solopreneurs validating startup ideas. The fastest-growing platform in the space. <br /><strong>$200M ARR</strong> — targeting $1B by summer 2026</p><h4><strong>Cursor</strong> — Dev power tool</h4><p>Made by Anysphere. VS Code-based AI code editor — the choice for professional developers. Supports Claude, GPT-4, and other models. Produces production-grade code with proper architecture. Required technical knowledge but unmatched depth. Valued at $9.9B. <br /><strong>$500M+ ARR</strong> — 2 years to get there</p><h4><strong>Bolt.new</strong> — Speed demon</h4><p>Browser-based. Zero setup. Type what you want, get a shareable URL in under 30 minutes — the fastest time-to-demo of any platform. Built on StackBlitz. Powered by Supabase backend. Best for hackathon prototypes and quick experiments, but code quality degrades over iterations.<br /><strong>Fast-growing</strong> — $100M+ ARR threshold crossed</p><h4><strong>Replit</strong> — Full environment</h4><p>The cloud IDE with an embedded AI Agent. Educator-favored. Strong for collaborative team environments. Built-in databases, deployment, and real-time multiplayer coding. Most powerful “middle ground” platform — too complex for pure beginners but excellent for learning developers and startup teams.<br /><strong>$10M → $100M ARR</strong> — in under 9 months</p><h4><strong>GitHub Copilot</strong> — Enterprise standard</h4><p>Microsoft’s flagship. Integrates into VS Code, JetBrains, and more. The largest user base of any AI coding tool. 82% of developers surveyed use it — the default entry point for enterprise teams. Code completion and inline suggestions rather than full app generation. $10–39/month.<br /><strong>$1B+ ARR</strong> — market leader by user count</p><h4><strong>Claude Code</strong> — Terminal agent</h4><p>Anthropic’s command-line AI engineer. Deep code understanding, multi-file reasoning, and agentic task execution. CB Insights named it the “runaway market leader” among LLM providers for pure coding use cases. For developers who want maximum intelligence with full control. Crossed $1B ARR.<br /><strong>$1B+ ARR</strong> — top 3 market position</p><h4><strong>Windsurf</strong> — Acquired by OpenAI</h4><p>Formerly Codeium. IDE-based with deep code understanding and agentic “flow” mode. Highest code quality scores in independent benchmarks (8.5/10). Acquired by OpenAI for $3 billion in May 2025 — the biggest statement yet about where AI coding is heading.<br /><strong>$3B acquisition</strong> — by OpenAI · May 2025</p><h4><strong>v0 by Vercel</strong> — UI specialist</h4><p>Vercel’s AI-powered UI generator. Highest quality score in benchmarks (9/10). Specializes in component and UI generation using React + shadcn/ui. Not a full app builder but the best tool if you want beautiful, production-quality front-end components fast. Free tier available.<br /><strong>Free + pro tiers</strong> — part of Vercel ecosystem</p><blockquote>“A year ago, they would have built their product from scratch. <br />But now 95% of it is built by an AI. You don’t need a team of 50 <br />engineers anymore. Companies are reaching $10 million in revenue with <br />teams of less than 10.” - Garry Tan, CEO, Y Combinator, March 2025</blockquote><h3>Who is actually using these tools?</h3><p>The data paints a picture that surprises most people. This isn’t just developers upgrading their workflow. The user base of AI coding platforms is fundamentally different from what the software world has ever seen before.</p><figure><img alt=""Developer adoption by segment — 2025 SegmentAdoptionEnterprise devs97%Full-stack devs90%Startup founders85%Frontend devs82%Non-technical47%Backend devs35%"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wf-P4Ygqa9AEq5huJcdSdQ.png"" /><figcaption>(Source: <a href=""https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/ai/"">Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2025</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Three distinct tribes are using these tools, each for very different reasons:</p><h4>Tribe 1: The non-technical founder</h4><p>The biggest story of the AI coding era isn’t that developers got faster — it’s that the definition of “developer” has exploded. 47% of people now applying AI to coding do so for work or school, and 41% use it for personal projects, according to Menlo Ventures’ 2025 State of Consumer AI report. These are designers, product managers, marketers, and domain experts who previously needed to hire engineers to build their ideas. With Lovable or Bolt, they don’t anymore.</p><p>Gartner predicts 70% of new applications will be built outside traditional IT departments by end of 2025. That is happening. Real estate agents are building property management tools. Teachers are building grading apps. Small business owners are building custom CRMs. The phrase you see repeated constantly in community forums:</p><blockquote>“Lovable figured out what to build when I couldn’t.”</blockquote><h4>Tribe 2: The technical Startup Founder</h4><p>This is the group that surprised everyone — including YC. These aren’t non-technical people using AI because they have no choice. They’re highly skilled engineers using AI because it’s <em>dramatically faster</em>. The YC Winter 2025 data is stunning: 25% of startups with 95% AI-generated code were <strong>fully capable</strong> of writing that code manually. They chose not to. This cohort grew at 10% per week collectively — the fastest-growing YC batch ever recorded. Companies in this wave are reaching $10M revenue with teams of fewer than 10 people.</p><h4>Tribe 3: The enterprise developer</h4><p>The 63% of the market held by large enterprises is quieter but massive. GitHub Copilot integration into existing IDE workflows. Amazon CodeWhisperer for AWS shops. Internal deployment of fine-tuned models for regulated industries. These teams aren’t vibe coding — they’re using AI for code review, documentation, test generation, and completing specific functions. 61% of mid-to-large U.S. software enterprises have integrated AI pair-programming into their CI/CD pipelines as of 2025.</p><h4>Sector distribution — who uses it</h4><ul><li><strong>Saas products</strong> — 34%</li><li><strong>Fintech</strong> — 21%</li><li><strong>Healthtech</strong> — 15%</li><li><strong>E-commerce</strong> — 13%</li><li><strong>Other (Education / Government / Misc.)</strong> — 17%</li></ul><h3>The real problems nobody talks about</h3><p>Every platform announcement shows beautiful demos. Every founder testimonial is glowing. But spend enough time in the trenches — building 47 applications across these tools as one reviewer did — and a very different picture emerges. Here are the seven critical issues users face globally, backed by real research:</p><h4><strong>01<br />Security holes</strong></h4><p>A May 2025 study found 170 of 1,645 Lovable-built apps exposed personal user data. Guardio Labs discovered “VibeScamming” — attackers can inject malicious prompts that cause AI to generate backdoors. No platform auto-audits for security. Human review is non-negotiable for production apps.</p><h4><strong>02<br />Code degrades over time</strong></h4><p>Multiple independent studies confirm: the 50th prompt produces measurably worse code than the 5th. As projects grow, AI-generated code becomes inconsistent and difficult to maintain. The context window fills up, patterns break down, and the codebase becomes something “nobody fully understands.”</p><h4><strong>03<br />The perception gap</strong></h4><p>The July 2025 METR study stunned the industry: experienced developers using AI tools took 19% longer on complex tasks despite feeling 20% faster. The illusion of speed is real. Code appears fast — but debugging AI output, understanding what was generated, and fixing mistakes eats the time saved.</p><h4><strong>04<br />Runway token costs</strong></h4><p>Consumption-based pricing is wildly unpredictable during iterative debugging. Bolt.new users have burned 2+ million tokens fixing a single bug. Some spent over $1,000 on a single project. Replit Agent credit depletion during active iteration regularly shocks users. There’s no cost ceiling.</p><h4><strong>05<br />Compliance blind spots</strong></h4><p>For regulated industries — finance, healthcare, government — none of these platforms meet production compliance requirements. No SOC2. No HIPAA-ready default configurations. No audit trails. All platforms are explicitly prototyping tools. Trying to ship to production without human review in these sectors is genuinely dangerous.</p><h4><strong>06<br />Vendor lock-in</strong></h4><p>Bolt.new and Replit make migration painful. Your project becomes deeply tied to their infrastructure. v0 and Lovable are easiest to migrate away from. For startups choosing these platforms, the exit strategy is rarely considered upfront — and becomes a serious problem at scale.</p><h4><strong>07<br />The almost “ right “ frustration</strong></h4><p>Stack Overflow’s 2025 survey found that 66% of developers’ biggest AI frustration is “solutions that are almost right but not quite.” This near-miss problem is uniquely maddening: the AI produces something that looks correct, passes casual inspection, but breaks at the edges. Debugging this is a new cognitive skill entirely.</p><h4><strong>08<br />Technical debit explosion</strong></h4><p>AI-assisted coding leads to 4x more code cloning, increasing maintenance effort over time. Google’s 2024 DORA report found AI use caused a 7.2% drop in delivery stability. 62.4% of developers cite technical debt as their top frustration — and AI is accelerating its accumulation for teams without strong review practices.</p><h4><strong>09<br />No real production-ready code</strong></h4><p>Every benchmark study reaches the same conclusion: no AI coding platform produces code you can ship to production without significant manual finishing. The speed gains are genuine for prototypes. But the quality gap is equally real for anything that needs to last beyond a demo.</p><h3>AI coding vs. Manual coding: The real comparison</h3><p>The debate “AI vs. human coding” misframes the reality. The better question is: for what tasks, for what users, at what stage does AI coding deliver genuine value — and where does it create hidden costs?</p><h4>Time to first prototype</h4><p><strong>AI Coding platforms</strong><br />Applications can be generated in 28–45 minutes. These tools provide dramatic gains for non-technical founders and small teams seeking rapid validation.</p><p><strong>Manual human coding</strong><br />Initial builds typically take hours to days depending on architecture, complexity, and stack decisions.</p><p><strong>Assessment:</strong> AI platforms provide a significant advantage in early-stage prototyping and rapid iteration.</p><h4>Code quality (Simple applications)</h4><p><strong>AI coding platforms</strong><br />Generally sufficient for MVPs and demos. Generated code is functional and often built on consistent starter stacks.</p><p><strong>Manual human coding</strong><br />Quality depends entirely on developer skill level. Strong engineers can produce clean, extensible foundations from the start.</p><p><strong>Assessment:</strong> For straightforward applications, AI-generated code is often adequate.</p><h4>Code quality (Complex systems)</h4><p><strong>AI coding platforms</strong><br />Code quality degrades over time. As projects expand, inconsistencies increase, architectural patterns fragment, and maintainability becomes challenging.</p><p><strong>Manual human coding</strong><br />Architectural integrity is intentionally designed and maintained. Technical decisions are deliberate and aligned with long-term system goals.</p><p><strong>Assessment:</strong> For complex or long-lived systems, manual engineering maintains structural coherence more effectively.</p><h4>Security</h4><p><strong>AI coding platforms</strong><br />Elevated vulnerability risk without manual auditing. Prompt injection risks and insecure defaults require active oversight.</p><p><strong>Manual human coding</strong><br />Security patterns are applied intentionally through training, experience, and established review processes.</p><p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Production-grade security still requires human review regardless of AI assistance.</p><h4>Speed (Senior developers)</h4><p><strong>AI coding platforms</strong><br />Studies indicate experienced developers may take longer on complex tasks when using AI tools, despite a perception of increased speed.</p><p><strong>Manual human coding</strong><br />Expert engineers often move faster on nuanced architectural and system-level decisions.</p><p><strong>Assessment:</strong> AI accelerates repetitive tasks but does not consistently outperform experienced developers on sophisticated work.</p><h4>Speed (Junior developers and non-technical users)</h4><p><strong>AI coding platforms</strong><br />Documented productivity gains of approximately 26% in certain studies. Enables non-coders to build functional applications.</p><p><strong>Manual human coding</strong><br />Requires months or years of training to achieve similar output.</p><p><strong>Assessment:</strong> AI significantly lowers the barrier to entry.</p><h4>Cost</h4><p><strong>AI coding platforms</strong><br />Subscription pricing combined with unpredictable token consumption. Costs can spike significantly during debugging cycles.</p><p><strong>Manual human coding</strong><br />Fixed salary costs. High per-hour expense but predictable for planning purposes.</p><p><strong>Assessment:</strong> AI lowers upfront cost but introduces variability.</p><h4>Startup viability</h4><p><strong>AI coding platforms</strong><br />Small teams can achieve meaningful revenue milestones with minimal engineering headcount. Rapid iteration supports aggressive growth experimentation.</p><p><strong>Manual human coding</strong><br />Requires larger teams to reach similar output velocity.</p><p><strong>Assessment:</strong> AI creates leverage in early-stage startups.</p><h4>Scalability</h4><p><strong>AI coding platforms</strong><br />Production systems often require significant refactoring. AI-generated code rarely scales without human rework.</p><p><strong>Manual human coding</strong><br />Systems can be designed for scale from inception when architected by experienced engineers.</p><p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Scalability depends heavily on human oversight.</p><h4>Learning and understanding</h4><p><strong>AI coding platforms</strong><br />Risk of using code that developers do not fully understand. May create “black box” dependencies.</p><p><strong>Manual human coding</strong><br />Deep understanding compounds over time. Knowledge of system components strengthens architectural decision-making.</p><p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Long-term technical mastery requires active engagement beyond generated output.</p><p>AI coding platforms are powerful acceleration tools. They are highly effective for prototyping, validation, and enabling non-technical creators. However, long-term system stability, security, architectural integrity, and scalability still rely heavily on human engineering judgment.</p><p>The strategic question is not whether AI replaces developers. It is where AI meaningfully augments them — and where human expertise remains indispensable.</p><blockquote>The verdict isn’t simple. “AI tools are genuinely transformative for prototyping, validation, and non-technical builders”. They’re genuinely problematic for production systems without human oversight. The “right” answer depends entirely on your position in the product lifecycle and your risk tolerance.</blockquote><h3>Where the money is: Market data</h3><figure><img alt=""Bar chart titled “Platform Revenue Race — 2025 ARR Estimates (CB Insights)” showing GitHub Copilot and Claude Code at $1B+, Cursor at $500M+, Lovable at $200M, Replit at $100M, and Bolt.new at $100M+.Market Data"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IuBZj12TfpG3JwVESJ4Geg.png"" /></figure><p>The total AI coding market is on a trajectory that analysts estimate will reach $99 billion by 2034. The combined equity funding raised by players in this space already exceeded $5.2 billion in 2025 alone — more than double the $2 billion raised the year before. Over 60 mergers, acquisitions, and partnerships occurred in the AI developer tools ecosystem in 2024–2025. This is not a niche software category anymore. It is a platform war <em>(Source: </em><a href=""https://www.cbinsights.com/research/ai-software-development-market-map/""><strong><em>CB Insights Market Map</em></strong></a><em>)</em></p><p>Geography matters too: North America holds 43% of the current market but Asia-Pacific is the fastest-growing region at a 27.4% CAGR. India, particularly, is seeing explosive growth in AI-assisted development across both enterprise adoption and startup formation. The IT and telecommunications sector leads usage at 29.4% of the market — but banking and financial services (BFSI) is the fastest-growing vertical at 28.13% CAGR.</p><h3>The human truth at the core</h3><p>Here is the thing that gets buried under all the revenue numbers and platform wars: every AI coding platform in existence was built by humans. Trained by humans. Fed data by humans. Evaluated by humans. Corrected by humans. The “intelligence” that pops out a React app from a text prompt is the crystallized output of millions of hours of human code written by developers over decades, scraped from GitHub repositories, Stack Overflow answers, documentation pages, and technical blogs.</p><p>This isn’t a criticism — it’s a clarification. The AI doesn’t “know” how to build software the way a senior engineer knows. It pattern-matches. It predicts what code should follow the tokens you gave it, based on what it saw in training.</p><p>That is why it fails in ways that feel eerily specific: it produces code that looks correct but has subtle logical errors. It follows conventions without understanding the reasoning behind them. It solves problems it’s seen before brilliantly; it stumbles on genuinely novel architectural challenges.</p><figure><img alt=""Dark-themed code snippet explaining how AI generates code: tokenize prompt, attend to context, predict next tokens, repeat — while noting it doesn’t truly understand business logic; ends with returning “code that looks right” plus hidden complexity.71% of developers say they do not merge AI-generated code without manual review."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yie8x0iI5YhOxWPXYB1Khg.png"" /></figure><p>This is why the most dangerous users of AI coding platforms are the ones who trust them completely. The safest users are those who treat AI output the way a senior developer treats a junior developer’s pull request: read it carefully, understand it fully, question its assumptions, test its edge cases, and only then merge it.</p><p><strong>71% of developers say they do not merge AI-generated code without manual review. </strong>That number should be 100%. The 29% who skip review are accumulating technical debt faster than they realize, in a codebase increasingly full of code whose logic they don’t fully understand.</p><p>The brilliant insight buried in the METR study is that AI doesn’t make developers faster across the board — it makes <em>less-experienced</em> developers faster, while potentially slowing down senior engineers on complex problems. This suggests the technology is doing something more interesting than pure acceleration: it is compressing the skill gap.</p><p>A junior developer with <strong>AI tools can produce work that once required mid-level experience.</strong> A non-technical founder can now build what once required a small engineering team. That democratization is real and meaningful. But it comes with the risk of deploying systems built without the depth of understanding that comes from having built them the hard way.</p><h3>Are people actually launching real products?</h3><p>Short answer: yes, but with important asterisks.</p><p>YC’s Winter 2025 data is the most compelling evidence. Companies in that cohort growing 10% per week with sub-10-person teams and genuine customers are not demos or experiments — they’re real businesses. YC CEO Garry Tan pointed to startups reaching $10M in revenue with fewer than 10 people. That would have been structurally impossible in 2019.</p><p>The common pattern in communities like Reddit and Indie Hackers follows a “graduate workflow”: prototype fast in Lovable or Bolt, validate with real users quickly, then either rebuild properly in Cursor or traditional development once the idea is proven — or hire an engineer to clean up the codebase for production. Start vibe, graduate to code.</p><p>Lovable projects $1 billion in ARR by summer 2026 — five times its current $200M run rate. That would make it one of the fastest-scaling B2C software products in history. Whether that reflects genuine product launches or churning users experimenting with prototypes is the key question. The honest answer: both. High-churn is a documented concern across all these platforms, precisely because the barrier to trying is so low that many users spin up projects they never finish.</p><p>The sectors where AI coding platforms are generating real-world product launches break down clearly: SaaS tools (34%), fintech applications (21%), healthtech prototypes (15%), and e-commerce storefronts (13%). The fintech and healthtech numbers are notable precisely because these are <em>regulated industries</em> where AI-generated code requires the most careful human review before shipping — and where the security vulnerabilities documented in 2025 represent the highest actual risk.</p><h3>Final word</h3><p>So what does it all mean?</p><p>We are in the middle of a genuine platform shift — one that happens once or twice per generation in software. The printing press didn’t replace writers; it made writing accessible to millions more people and changed what “writing” meant forever. The spreadsheet didn’t replace accountants; it changed what accountants spent their time doing. AI coding platforms are doing something similar to software development.</p><p>The question is not whether to use these tools. <strong>82% of developers already do, daily.</strong> The question is whether you’re using them with eyes open — understanding what they actually are (pattern-matching engines trained on human knowledge), what they’re good at (speed, scaffolding, prototyping, compressing the skill gap), and what they’re bad at (security, novel architecture, complex production systems).</p><h4>The real win</h4><p>AI coding tools have genuinely democratized software creation. Millions of people who could not previously build software now can. That is a profound and real expansion of human capability — not hype.</p><h4>The real risk</h4><p>Production systems built with AI and not reviewed by experienced engineers are accumulating vulnerabilities, technical debt, and architectural problems that will surface at scale. The bill will come due.</p><h4>The uncomfortable truth</h4><p>AI doesn’t know what it doesn’t know. It generates plausible code, not correct code. The difference only becomes visible when the system fails under real-world conditions that the training data didn’t anticipate.</p><h4>The bigger picture</h4><p>Every model was built on human knowledge. AI is not a new form of intelligence — it’s the stored pattern of human intelligence, made instantly accessible. The humans who fed it that knowledge are still the source of everything it can do.</p><p>The most honest summary: AI coding platforms are the best prototyping tools ever built and potentially dangerous production deployment tools if used without human oversight. Use them to go from zero to validated idea in a weekend. Use experienced engineers to take it from there. The future belongs to builders who understand both sides of that line — and know precisely when they’re on the wrong one.</p><blockquote>The code revolution isn’t coming. It’s here.

<h4>How systems become risky without anyone noticing.</h4><figure><img alt=""A Painting of Alexander Cutting the Gordian Knot"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*urJTxEUxB1exhlGRMTz9tg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Alexander Undoing the Gordian | Source: Knot 1st-art-gallery.com</figcaption></figure><p>No one decides to build a fragile system. No executive convenes a meeting to discuss how best to make operations inscrutable, unreliable, brittle. No engineer sets out to create software that no one can maintain or discern later on. No organization deliberately designs processes so convoluted that they guarantee failure.</p><p>Yet fragile, incomprehensible, unmaintainable, and failure-prone systems are everywhere. They are the norm. Systems that excel and are resilient are exceptional. So how come? Fragile systems didn’t arrive through dramatic decisions or catastrophic errors. They evolved. Their fragility and brittleness were accumulated gradually, through a thousand small, locally rational choices that collectively created something unmanageable. Therein lies the importance of Systems Thinking. To understand the aggregate dynamics of individual choices.</p><p><a href=""https://openlearning.mit.edu/news/ask-mit-professor-what-system-thinking-and-why-it-important"">Systems Thinking </a>is the best defense we have against the complexity run amuck. Complexity is an emergent property of systems. It evolves not from reckless decision-making but from responding sensibly to immediate, localized needs. A new feature here, a workaround there, an exception to handle an edge case, a patch to fix an urgent problem. Each addition seems small. Each solves a real problem. Each is approved and implemented with good intentions.</p><p>But complexity isn’t an additive attribute. It multiplies.</p><figure><img alt=""A diagram that demonstrates that the complexity of a system (connections) grows exponentially with the number of components in a system"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/776/0*2MfYpvTLBmGK5aYk.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Source: Author</figcaption></figure><p>Take the image above. In the abstract it does a good job of demonstrating complexity. A system of 3 nodes has just 3 unique connections. A system with 1 more node, doubles the number of connections to 6. Double that system and the number of connections grows exponentially. Somewhere along the way the system crosses a threshold where the system becomes so fraught with complexity that it creates genuine risk. Like the emergence of complexity, the probability also increases exponentially.</p><p><strong>How Complexity Accumulates</strong></p><p>The first step in managing complexity is understanding how it sneaks into systems despite everyone’s best efforts to keep things simple.</p><p>Feature Creep</p><p>Every user wants one more feature. Every stakeholder has a use case that isn’t quite covered. Every competitive analysis reveals something rivals offer that you don’t. The pressure to add is constant and multifaceted.</p><p>Individual feature requests seem reasonable. A customer needs the system to handle a specific edge case. A sales prospect will sign if you just add this one capability. An internal team needs special handling for their workflow.</p><p>Saying yes to each request improves the system for someone. But each addition increases the surface area of the system, manifesting in more code to maintain, more interactions to test, more documentation to write, more training to conduct, as well as an expanded Optimal Design Domain. The complexity grows with the factorial of features.</p><p>Procedural Layering</p><p>Organizations respond to problems <a href=""https://irb.northwestern.edu/compliance-education/corrective-and-preventive-action-capa-plans.html"">by adding procedures</a>. A mistake occurs; a new approval process is implemented. An audit finds gaps; a new compliance check is required. A risk materializes; a new control is instituted.</p><p>Each procedure makes sense in isolation. We should approve major purchases. We should verify compliance. We should control risk. But procedures accumulate faster than they’re removed. Organizations rarely ask, “What procedure can we eliminate now that we’re adding this one?”</p><p>The result is sedimentary layers of process, each representing a response to some past problem, many now obsolete but all still in force because no one has authority or incentive to remove them.</p><p><a href=""https://www.tocinstitute.org/theory-of-constraints.html"">The Theory of Constraints</a> (ToC) identifies this as policy constraints — rules and procedures that become bottlenecks themselves. <a href=""https://www.tocinstitute.org/eliyahu-goldratt.html"">Goldratt </a>(the creator of ToC) observed that organizations often implement policies to optimize local efficiency but never revisit them when conditions change, creating system-level dysfunction.</p><p>Informal Complexity, Work Arounds</p><p>When formal systems don’t serve user needs well, people create workarounds. They copy data manually between systems. They use spreadsheets to track what the official system should track but doesn’t. They develop informal communication channels because formal ones are too slow.</p><p>In my experience as an engineer, systems designer, and consultant, this is actually the norm of how business gets done. People are very entrepreneurial by nature. There’s never a formalized meeting to figure out how business operations ought to be completed, they just figure out what works, and that becomes the best practice. This is great for getting things done, but it also means that there is usually lots of low-hanging fruit to optimize these systems, usually at low cost.</p><p>Workarounds are innovations at the edges. They represent localized problem-solving that keeps work flowing. But they’re also a key driver of hidden complexity. The formal system looks simple on paper, but the actual operating system includes dozens of undocumented workarounds that only certain people know about.</p><p>When those people leave, their workarounds break. When systems change, workarounds that depended on specific quirks stop working. When new people join, they don’t know the workarounds exist and make errors because the formal system doesn’t match operational reality.</p><p>Technical Debt and The Infrastructure Accumulation</p><p>In software, technical debt is explicit and easy to detect. Shortcuts are taken to complete a project faster, leaving behind code that should be refactored later. Often, “later” never comes, and the debt accumulates.</p><p>But technical debt exists in all systems, not just software. In manufacturing, we regularly see equipment that’s been patched repeatedly, or modules added onto instead of replaced. In organizational design we even see it in the form of reporting lines being added without rethinking the fundamental design. It’s the sales training program that’s been updated piecemeal for every new product instead of redesigned.</p><p>Each piece of debt makes future changes harder. The code becomes harder to modify, because the internal logic is already fractal. The manufacturing equipment becomes more fragile. The organization becomes more difficult to reorganize. The training becomes less effective. The system becomes rigid precisely when it needs to be adaptive.</p><p><strong>Complexity Increases Faster Than Our Ability to Understand It</strong></p><p>A system’s complexity doesn’t scale linearly with system size. A system twice as large isn’t twice as complex. It’s often four times, eight times, or exponentially more complex.</p><p>Interaction Effects</p><p>An interaction is the reciprocal cause-and-effect relationship between two components within a system. This is important to understand how systems behave as a whole. Systems are not merely the sum of their parts. It means that as systems grow their complexity is boosted by the mutual and cyclical relationships., highlighting that influences are mutual and cyclical, not linear. A system with 10 components has 45 potential interaction pairs, but a system with 100 components has 4,950.</p><p>Most interactions don’t matter most of the time. But under stress, under unusual conditions, or when specific combinations occur, obscure interactions become critical. And the more interactions exist, the more likely that some will create failure modes no one anticipated. This is the principle of <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/bad-design-is-like-a-virus-design-defects-and-latent-failures-1e0ab4be7e52"">resident pathogens</a>.</p><p>You cannot understand a system by understanding its parts in isolation. The interactions between parts often dominate behavior. As those interactions multiply, understanding the whole becomes exponentially harder.</p><p>Emergent Behaviors</p><p>Complex systems exhibit emergent behaviors. Emergent behaviors are system-level properties that don’t exist in any individual component. Traffic jams emerge from individual driver decisions. Market crashes emerge from individual trading behaviors. Organizational dysfunction emerges from individual departmental optimizations. Flocking patterns of birds and Schools of Fish emerge as a result of many constituents which don’t, in and of themselves, possess these emergent properties.</p><figure><img alt=""A flock of birds during a yellow sunset"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*wIMNA47WVg3BzCiR.jpg"" /><figcaption>A Flock of birds as emergent behavior found in nature | Source: Arstechnica.com</figcaption></figure><p>Often spawned by localized decision making, these emergent properties are often negative (at least from the system designer’s perspective), namely because they are unintended and unexpected consequences. And they’re nearly impossible to predict because they emerge from the interaction of many factors, not from any single cause.</p><p><em>A side note/rant:</em></p><p><em>This is why I’m bearish when it comes to the future of gene editing technology. Gene editing methods like </em><a href=""https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2024/06/stanford-explainer-crispr-gene-editing-and-beyond""><em>CRISPR </em></a><em>uses correlations and probability to edit genes for some desired effect, eye color. But (1) these may correlate with other factors not accounted for (</em><a href=""https://www.the-scientist.com/how-are-earwax-and-body-odor-linked-72476""><em>like the relationship between earwax and body odor</em></a><em>) and (2) the collective editing of multiple genes can have greater unintended [read: emergent] consequences.</em></p><p>Cognitive Limits</p><p>Human working memory can hold roughly seven chunks of information. When a system has hundreds or thousands of interacting components, no individual can hold the complete system in their head. Understanding becomes distributed across many people, each of whom has a partial view.</p><p>This fragmentation of understanding is itself a risk. No one sees the whole. Decisions are made based on local knowledge that doesn’t account for global effects. Changes are implemented without understanding full implications. The system becomes too complex for anyone to fully reason about.</p><p><strong>Real-World Complexity Failures</strong></p><p>Healthcare.gov Launch (2013)</p><p>The Affordable Care Act’s federal insurance exchange launched in October 2013 and immediately collapsed. The website couldn’t handle traffic. Applications failed. Users couldn’t complete enrollment.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*bbTMPytERu-EIAQH.png"" /><figcaption>The now famous error screen of HealthCare.gov | Source: Medium.com</figcaption></figure><p>The failure wasn’t a single bug or bad decision. It was systemic complexity. Multiple contractors built different pieces. Systems needed to integrate with existing federal databases. State exchanges needed to interface with the federal system. Security requirements added layers. Compliance rules created conditional logic. <a href=""https://medium.com/dataseries/small-is-beautiful-the-launch-failure-of-healthcare-gov-5e60f20eb967"">Edge cases demanded special handling</a>.</p><p>Each component worked (more or less) in isolation. But integrating them revealed cascade failures, timing issues, and interaction effects no one had anticipated. The system was too complex for anyone to fully understand, and that complexity created fragility.</p><p>Knight Capital Trading Loss (2012)</p><p><a href=""https://www.henricodolfing.ch/en/case-study-4-the-440-million-software-error-at-knight-capital/"">Knight Capital</a> deployed new trading software to seven of eight servers. The eighth still ran old code. When trading began, the old code executed differently than the new code. Orders from the mixed system created erratic behavior that cost $440 million in 45 minutes.</p><p>The complexity wasn’t in the trading logic itself but was in the deployment process, version control, and fail-safes (or lack thereof). Each element seemed manageable. But the interaction of partial deployment, legacy code, and automated trading created a failure mode that destroyed the company.</p><p>Boeing 787 Development Delays</p><p><a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/24/business/boeing-787-dreamliner-halt"">Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner was years late </a>and billions over budget, largely due to complexity in managing a global supply chain with unprecedented outsourcing. Boeing delegated entire aircraft sections to suppliers, who delegated to sub-suppliers.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/780/0*K3iiLYAXxETopbEa"" /><figcaption>A Boeing Dreamliner Production Line | Source: Seattletimes.com</figcaption></figure><p>The complexity wasn’t within the airplane design. It was organizational and logistical. Coordinating work across dozens of companies, ensuring interface compatibility, managing schedule dependencies, and integrating testing added complexity that multiplied with every additional partner and interface.</p><p><strong>Detecting Accumulated Complexity</strong></p><p>Complexity accumulates invisibly until it causes problems. How do you detect it before it becomes critical?</p><p>Warning Signs:</p><ol><li><strong>Lengthening cycle times</strong>: Changes that used to take days now take weeks. This often signals that complexity has increased friction.</li><li><strong>Rising error rates</strong>: More defects, more support tickets, more exceptions. Complexity creates more failure modes.</li><li><strong>Knowledge silos</strong>: Only certain people can work on certain systems because they’re too complex for newcomers to learn quickly.</li><li><strong>Fear of change</strong>: Teams resist modifications because they’re not confident about side effects. “If it’s working, don’t touch it” becomes the mantra.</li><li><strong>Escalating maintenance costs</strong>: More time spent fixing and patching, less time spent building new capability.</li><li><strong>Integration problems</strong>: New features break existing functionality in unexpected ways.</li><li><strong>Documentation drift</strong>: Formal documentation no longer matches actual operation because the system has evolved through undocumented changes.</li></ol><p>These symptoms don’t prove complexity directly, but they correlate strongly with systems that have accumulated too much of it.</p><p>Quantitative Measures:</p><p>For software systems, metrics like <a href=""https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/cyclomatic-complexity/"">cyclomatic complexity</a>, coupling metrics, and dependency graphs provide numerical complexity measures and diagnostic tools. But even non-software systems can be measured:</p><ul><li><strong>Decision tree depth</strong>: How many conditional branches exist in a process?</li><li><strong>Role count</strong>: How many different roles touch a workflow?</li><li><strong>Approval layers</strong>: How many sign-offs does a decision require?</li><li><strong>Exception frequency</strong>: How often do standard processes require exceptions?</li><li><strong>Handoff count</strong>: How many times does work transfer between people or systems?</li></ul><p>High values don’t automatically mean there’s a problem. Complexity is sometimes necessary. But they indicate where to look for opportunities to simplify and where to triage when something breaks.</p><p><strong>Pruning Unnecessary Complexity</strong></p><p>Once you’ve detected complexity, how do you reduce it without breaking things that work?</p><p>1. Dependency Mapping</p><p>You can’t simplify what you don’t understand. Create visual maps of dependencies:</p><ul><li>What depends on what?</li><li>What components interact?</li><li>What can be changed independently?</li><li>Where are the tight couplings?</li></ul><figure><img alt=""An example of a dependency map"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZidzvGzhvpLFVASu2l9qtQ.png"" /><figcaption>An example of a dependency map | Source: dependency-map.com</figcaption></figure><p>Tools exist for software (dependency analyzers, architecture visualization). For organizational systems, this might be process maps, responsibility matrices (RACI), or workflow diagrams.</p><p>2. The 80/20 Analysis</p><p>Most systems exhibit <a href=""https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/pareto-distribution"">Pareto distributions</a>: 20% of features deliver 80% of value, 20% of code contains 80% of bugs, 20% of procedures handle 80% of cases.</p><figure><img alt=""An Example of a Pareto Distribution"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*hKMuHOxk7ZxHLk1Z"" /><figcaption>An Example of a Pareto Distribution | Source: scirp.org</figcaption></figure><p>Identify:</p><ul><li>Which features are rarely used?</li><li>Which procedures handle edge cases?</li><li>Which code paths are seldom executed?</li></ul><p>These low-value, high-maintenance components are prime candidates for elimination. Removing them reduces surface area without significantly reducing capability.</p><p><a href=""https://www.lightsondata.com/why-focus-reduce-variation/"">Deming’s focus on variation reduction</a> is relevant here. Simplification reduces sources of variation, making systems more stable and predictable. Eliminating rarely-used features eliminates rare but costly failure modes.</p><p>3. Complexity Budgets</p><p>Treat complexity as a constrained resource, like memory or budget. Every addition must fit within the budget, which means something else might need to be removed.</p><p>This forces explicit trade-offs: “To add this feature, we need to remove three existing ones. Which should go?” The question surfaces costs that are otherwise hidden.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/@ankitsingh1583/how-netflix-uber-and-amazon-manage-their-microservices-at-scale-97b028da2134"">Netflix famously has a policy limiting microservices complexity</a>: teams can add new services, but the total count must stay within bounds, forcing consolidation and simplification as a regular practice.</p><p>4. Simplification Audits</p><p>Regularly review systems specifically to identify simplification opportunities:</p><ul><li>Which procedures exist because of problems that no longer occur?</li><li>Which features could be consolidated?</li><li>Which integrations could be eliminated?</li><li>Which exceptions could be standardized?</li></ul><p>The <a href=""https://www.tocinstitute.org/theory-of-constraints.html"">Theory of Constraints</a> teaches to focus improvement efforts on constraints. But TOC also recognizes that non-constraint resources shouldn’t be optimized to full capacity. Similarly, not every part of a system needs maximum capability. Some parts can and should be simplified, even if it means slightly reduced local performance, if it improves overall system manageability.</p><p>5. Modular Decomposition</p><p>Break complex systems into loosely <a href=""https://aisel.aisnet.org/ecis2022_rp/52/"">coupled modules </a>with clear interfaces. This doesn’t reduce total complexity, but it contains and partitions it.</p><p>A monolithic system with 1,000 interconnected parts is unmanageable. Ten modules of 100 parts each, with well-defined interfaces between modules, is manageable. You can understand one module deeply without needing to understand all modules.</p><p>This requires discipline in interface design: modules should interact through narrow, well-specified interfaces, not through deep coupling or shared state. When modularity is maintained, complexity within modules stays local and doesn’t ripple system-wide.</p><p>6. Standardization and Platforming</p><p>Reduce variety by standardizing components and building on common platforms. Instead of five different authentication systems, use one. Instead of three different data formats, standardize on one.</p><p>This trades flexibility for simplicity. You can’t optimize each use case perfectly, but you reduce the number of things that need to be understood, maintained, and integrated.</p><p><a href=""https://www.6sigma.us/business-process-management-articles/process-standardization-for-operational-excellence/"">Standardization of processes is foundational for quality</a>. You can’t improve what varies wildly. You can’t maintain what’s different everywhere. Standardization creates the baseline from which to build, measure, and improve.</p><p><strong>Culture and Resisting Complexity</strong></p><p>Technical approaches help, but the deeper challenge is cultural. Organizations must develop a <a href=""https://www.pmi.org/disciplined-agile/dealing-with-complexity-by-creating-a-bias-for-simplicity"">bias toward simplicity</a>, which cuts against many incentives.</p><p>Incentive Misalignments:</p><ul><li>Product managers are rewarded for feature additions, not feature removals</li><li>Engineers are evaluated on what they build, not what they eliminate</li><li>Processes are added in response to visible problems; removing them is invisible work</li><li>Budgets reward spending, not simplification</li></ul><p>To counter these, organizations need to:</p><ul><li><strong>Celebrate simplification</strong>: Publicize cases where removing features improved the product</li><li><strong>Measure complexity explicitly</strong>: Track metrics like code complexity, process steps, and approval layers</li><li><strong>Require simplification alongside addition</strong>: New features must be accompanied by the removal of old features</li><li><strong>Create dedicated simplification initiatives</strong>: Not as ongoing work but as explicit projects with resources</li></ul><p>The Power of “No”</p><p>The most important complexity control is saying no to additions. This is politically difficult — every addition has a constituency. But the cumulative cost of saying yes too often is a system that collapses under its own weight.</p><p>Saying no requires:</p><ul><li>Clear criteria for what’s in scope and what’s not</li><li>Explicit recognition that the capacity for complexity is limited</li><li>Willingness to disappoint stakeholders in the service of system sustainability</li><li>Authority structures that can enforce boundaries</li></ul><p><a href=""https://www.uwyo.edu/ceps/development/awards/deming.html"">W. Edwards Deming</a>’s point about <a href=""https://deming.org/create-constancy-of-purpose/"">constancy of purpose</a> applies here. Without a consistent commitment to simplicity, complexity accumulates as each decision optimizes locally without considering global effects.</p><p><strong>Living with Necessary Complexity</strong></p><p>Some complexity is essential. Real-world problems are complex; solutions must match that complexity to some degree. The eliminate unnecessary complexity while managing necessary complexity effectively.</p><p><strong>Essential Complexity:</strong></p><ul><li>Business rules that reflect genuine domain complexity</li><li>Integration points that correspond to real organizational boundaries</li><li>Features that deliver significant value to significant user populations</li><li>Redundancy that provides resilience</li></ul><p>This complexity should be:</p><ul><li>Explicit: Documented and understood</li><li>Contained: Modularized so it doesn’t leak</li><li>Justified: Regularly validated as still necessary</li></ul><p><strong>Accidental Complexity:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=""https://idenhaus.com/why-workarounds-are-iams-silent-killer/"">Workarounds</a> for systems that should be fixed</li><li>Procedures created in response to one-time events</li><li>Features that sounded good but are rarely used</li><li>Integration patterns that evolved organically without design</li></ul><p>This complexity should be systematically hunted and eliminated.</p><p>The distinction isn’t always clear, but the question should be constantly asked: is this complexity necessary, or did it just accumulate?</p><p><strong>Conclusion: Complexity as Systemic Debt</strong></p><p>Complexity is like financial debt: sometimes useful, always carrying a cost, and dangerous when it accumulates beyond your ability to service it.</p><p>Taking on debt to invest in growth can be smart. But debt that accumulates from routine operations without producing value is insidious. It constrains future options, increases risk, and eventually demands painful restructuring.</p><p>The same is true of complexity. Some complexity enables capability. But much of how complexity propagates is just accumulation, the residue of past decisions that no one has cleaned up. It makes the system fragile, expensive to maintain, and difficult to evolve.</p><p>The challenge is that complexity accumulates gradually and locally while its costs manifest globally and suddenly. Each small addition seems manageable. The cumulative effect is system failure that seems to come from nowhere but was actually built up over years of accretion.</p><p>Managing this requires:</p><ul><li><strong>Vigilance</strong>: Constantly watching for complexity creep</li><li><strong>Discipline</strong>: Resisting additions and forcing eliminations</li><li><strong>Understanding</strong>: Mapping and measuring complexity</li><li><strong>Investment</strong>: Dedicating resources to simplification</li><li><strong>Culture</strong>: Valuing simplicity as much as capability</li></ul><p>Systems should be designed for improvement, not just for operation. This means building systems that can be understood, modified, and simplified. Systems that resist simplification, where every change risks breaking something else, have accumulated too much complexity. I also mentioned this as a key principle to designing <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/responsible-tech-principles-for-technological-use-and-development-3de9f6d8f49d"">Responsible and Humane Technology</a>.</p><p>The risk isn’t that your system will fail catastrophically tomorrow. It’s that complexity accumulates silently until one day you discover your system has become so fragile, so opaque, and so expensive to maintain that it’s effectively unmaintainable. By then, you have few options: live with mounting failures or undertake expensive, risky restructuring.</p><p>The solution is prevention: treat complexity as debt, recognize when you’re taking it on, ensure it’s justified, and regularly pay it down. Build systems that can be simplified, not just systems that work. Create cultures that celebrate subtraction as much as addition.</p><blockquote>“Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away” — <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1020792.Antoine_de_Saint_Exup_ry"">Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</a></blockquote><p>Because in the long run, the systems that survive aren’t the ones with the most features, the most procedures, or the most components. They’re the ones that remain understandable, maintainable, and adaptable. They are the ones that resisted the inexorable accumulation of unnecessary complexity.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e222182a67f5"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-complexity-accumulates-e222182a67f5"">How complexity accumulates</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Yes, they’re powerful. Yes, they let us do more. But there’s this weird disconnect growing between me and the things I make. When everything is instant, it starts feeling like a slot machine. Except you always win. Which makes it more addictive. And somehow… also boring?</p><p>And you can’t stop. Social media keeps telling us to ship more, faster, be first. But when anyone has the power of a team of 10x engineers (lol), being first isn’t even a moat anymore. It’s just being slightly less late.</p><p>The worst part is what this comic is about. I catch myself using AI for things I used to enjoy doing. Changing a font size. Adjusting the border radius. Pushing pixels until the result made me proud.</p><p>I still do something similar, but now it’s a conversation. I tell the spirit in the terminal to do it for me. “Make the left padding a bit wider. Make the animation snappier. Use our subtle foreground color… don’t use any color, use our color token. Oh, and make it smaller, go from sm to xs.” That’s my new <em>pixel-pushing.</em></p><p>Why? Because I can. And that’s the trap.</p><p>The thing gets done but it doesn’t feel like I did anything. I could’ve written that code myself… but sometimes I don’t even know where the component lives in the files. I’d have to inspect the element in the browser, find the classes, copy them, search them in my IDE, locate the file, then edit it (am I the only one who does this?) So instead… I just talk to the machine. I overexplain so it only changes what I want. I don’t design anymore. I direct.</p><p>But these things could direct themselves too. The “human in the loop” feels less like the guide and more like the thing slowing it all down. Some people call this slowing of the machine… this fine-tuning… “taste.” The ultimate human moat. Guys, stop it with your “taste.” I’ve seen how you dress. You don’t have any. And taste is really just doing things the way the top 10% of creators do instead of the average. That’s a pattern. Patterns are exactly what these things are built to learn… just give it time (a month?).</p><p>But hey… this comic? I tried new angles, more creative shots. All hand-drawn. No model. No worktree. No extra-high reasoning. Just me and the canvas. And that feels good. Like… “look, mom, I made this!”</p><p>Look, I’m in a rut. I really love these tools, I love creating with AI, I’ve never felt so productive. They’re wild and they’re powerful. But I hope we keep the joy.

But if the past few months are anything to go by, they’ve been the ones schooling me, because lately, there’s only one brand on their lips — <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fbrand%2Fmedicube"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">and it’s Medicube</a>. </p>

But it’s managed to cut through the noise (read: the tens of other brilliant <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aestura-atobarrier-365-cream-moisturizer-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Korean brands</a> that have also made their way into <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ulta Beauty</a> and <a href=""https://amzn.to/4rFMdiR"">on Amazon</a>) to become one of the most talked-about and exciting names in the space. No, really. At a recent Medicube event, I’ve never seen my fellow editors more intrigued by a brand — specifically the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-led-wand-red-light-skin-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">LED Booster</a>. (They didn’t care that they were wearing makeup; the handy red-light tool went straight on their faces.) </p>



<p>With spring right around the corner, my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/skincare-trends-2026"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">skincare routine</a> was in need of a complete overhaul, so I swapped everything out for a full collection from Medicube. Here are all the products I’d recommend. </p>

<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fzero-pore-pad-pimprod2053434"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medicube Zero Pore Pad, $21</a> </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961481.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>This is one of Medicube’s <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fzero-pore-pad-pimprod2053434"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">top-reviewed products at Ulta</a> and the one I was most excited to try. First off, I love that it comes with a handy pair of tweezers, which makes light work of picking up each pad — a very helpful addition if you have long nails like I do. The pads themselves — 70 of them, by the way — are soaked in two exfoliating acids. </p>



<p>First up, 4.5% lactic acid, an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) that exfoliates the top layer of skin. This gentle acid makes skin smoother and brighter over time by chipping away at dead skin cells and fading hyperpigmentation. Besides exfoliating, it also boosts hydration. Then there’s 0.45% salicylic acid, a beta hydroxy acid (BHA). While also gentle, it seeps deeper into pores, breaking up the paste-like mix of oil and dead skin that contributes to pimples. One side of the pad is smooth, while the other is slightly rougher for manual exfoliation.</p>



<p>Happily, because the acids are relatively low in concentration, the pads don’t sting, even on my reactive skin, and they can be used daily. I’ve been using them for over three weeks at night, and I realized they really worked magic on my skin when I caught myself in my apartment mirror one evening and saw my skin literally glinting under the warm light. It’s a lot clearer and smoother, too. One thing I’m not sold on is the name. Pores are completely normal — you can’t shrink them or get rid of them. </p>

<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961478.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>These masks spotlight one of K-beauty’s most promising ingredients: PDRN. Without turning this into a biology lesson, it stands for polydeoxyribonucleotide — essentially DNA derived from salmon. Research suggests PDRN can <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11994882/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">help regenerate skin tissue</a>, promoting healing, reducing inflammation, and increasing collagen, the protein that keeps skin strong and supple. </p>



<p>I’ve been using one mask a week for a month, and the main difference I’ve noticed is how much more hydrated and juicy my skin looks afterwards — so much so that I don’t feel the need to follow with any other skincare. If you’re after that “glass” effect, this will definitely help you get there. I also love watching the mask shift from pink to transparent, a sign that your skin has drunk up all the goodness. Beyond the hydration boost, it’s simply a nice, relaxing ritual. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fcollagen-niacinamide-jelly-cream-pimprod2053650"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medicube Collagen Niacinamide Jelly Cream, $22</a> </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961507.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>This is my new favorite AM and PM moisturizer. As for the texture, the clue is in the name — it’s a transparent jelly rather than a gel-cream. I underestimated it, convinced it wouldn’t be enough to quench my thirsty cheeks and occasionally flaky forehead, plus keep pimples at bay, but my skin always feels smooth, hydrated, and comfortable. </p>



<p>It takes a second to stop feeling tacky, but the finish is matte, and it makes the perfect makeup primer. While I don’t necessarily believe topical collagen can boost your own supply, I do know it’s a fantastic hydrator — especially alongside moisturizing squalane and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/niacinamide-skin-care-products"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">oil-reducing niacinamide</a>. </p>



<p>I use this everywhere: under my eyes like eye cream, down my neck, and on the backs of my hands. I’m also really impressed by how much you get for the price. The tub houses an impressive 110ml of product. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fzero-pore-sa-clear-capsule-facial-deep-cleanser-pimprod2054911%3F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medicube Zero Pore SA Clear Capsule Facial Deep Cleanser, $16.90</a> </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961480.jpg?width=996&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=249%3A256"" /></figure>



<p>I’ve gone through two of these cleansers in recent months, and I’m almost certain my skin is clearer because of it. Like the Zero Pore Pads, it contains exfoliating acids — salicylic and mandelic — both of which help unclog pores and gradually fade post-acne marks. While it also contains tiny exfoliating particles, they’re very soft, and I barely notice them.</p>



<p>Happily, the second ingredient on the list is glycerin, a deeply moisturizing humectant, so it doesn’t leave my skin feeling tight. Since it’s a foaming face wash, I only use it in the evening after removing makeup with micellar water. In the morning, I <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-inkey-list-hydrating-cream-to-milk-cleanser-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">prefer something creamy and gentle</a> to avoid stripping my skin. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fpdrn-pink-peptide-serum-pimprod2053536"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medicube PDRN Pink Peptide Serum, $21</a> </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961508.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>If you really want to maximize the benefits of PDRN, this gentle daily serum is your best bet over a one-and-done face mask (though the mask is undeniably fun). Alongside PDRN, it contains no fewer than <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-peptide-lip-treatment-balm"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">five peptides</a> — short chains of amino acids that form the building blocks of proteins like collagen and elastin, which keep skin bouncy. </p>



<p>The inclusion of palmitoyl tripeptide-1 and palmitoyl tetrapeptide-7 is what makes it stand out. Together, they’re often dubbed “Botox in a bottle” and can help smooth skin texture over time. Since slotting it into my routine, I’m convinced my forehead lines look less obvious — at least to my eye. The matte finish helps, too, and means makeup glides on like a dream. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fbooster-pro-pimprod2053433%3Fsku%3D2645355"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medicube Booster Pro, $220</a> </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961503.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>This tool has all my beauty editor peers talking. There are four modes in total. First up, Booster Mode, which gently vibrates to help your skin better absorb your chosen moisturizer or serum. Second, MC Mode, which uses low-level microcurrent technology to stimulate facial muscles, giving skin a temporary “lift.” Third, Derma Shot Mode, which uses red <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/led-face-mask-red-light-skin-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">LED light</a> to encourage healing and support elasticity. Lastly, Air Shot Mode is designed to refine texture and pores. Personally, I don’t think it’s strong enough to actually exfoliate, but it does feel like a refreshing cool shot — especially nice if your skin gets inflamed or red after cleansing. </p>



<p>The catch? Consistency is key. You’ll only see results if you stick with it. I like to use the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-led-wand-red-light-skin-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">red and blue light modes</a> for five to 10 minutes at a time when I have large hormonal pimples. I’m convinced it helps reduce their size and ease the soreness. </p>

<p>We’re diving into the biggest handbag trends that we’re seeing translate from the runways to our favorite stores and the streets.<br /><br />Looking to both the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nyfw-spring-summer-2026-soccer-sport-fashion-trend"">Spring/Summer 2026</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-trends"">Fall/Winter 2026 collections</a> that debuted across global fashion weeks, we’ve narrowed down the most prominent handbag styles on showcase. For the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hilary-duff-nostalgia-concert-tour"">nostalgia lovers</a>, 2016-esque chain bags are having a major moment. For the those with traditional-with-a-twist aesthetics, undone-yet-ladylike bags are in. And for those who could never understand how people carry mini bags, spacious bowling bags are a popular choice.<br /><br />All of these trends build on our up-to-the-minute dispatch on the runway trends that we saw at Winter 2026 New York Fashion Week, as well as our forecasting of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-color-trends-2026"">top 2026 color trends</a>, best <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/denim-trends-2026"">denim silhouettes</a>, and emerging <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shoe-trends-2026"">shoe styles</a> to step into throughout the year.<br /><br />Ahead, see the purse shapes, fabrics, hardware, and colorways that some of our favorite designers have sent down their runways — cementing them as the handbag trends we’ll be seeing (and wearing) all year long.  </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>2016 Is Back &amp; So Are Chain-Strap Bags</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960941.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The mass nostalgia for 2016 is also infiltrating today’s fashion scene, and quickly. “Crossbody bags defined this era,” creative director and celebrity stylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/scotlouie/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Scot Louie</a> tells Refinery29. “Think: The Gucci Marmont and Dionysus, the Chanel Boy Bag, Valentino Rockstud… Bags from this era are tied to a moment when fashion felt expressive, visible, and communal, which is why they resonate again now.”<br /><br />Also of note? These bags all feature chain straps. And while chain-strap handbags have never really left Chanel’s runway (yes, they were prominent at the <a href=""https://wwd.com/fashion-news/shows-reviews/gallery/chanel-spring-2026-couture-1238526043/chanel-spring-2026-couture-56/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">2026 Spring Couture show</a> just weeks ago), more brands are embracing the old-school style, too. From Valentino’s chunky shoulder bags and Chloe’s frilly leather pouches to Stella McCartney’s XL totes and Ferragamo’s oblong clutches, chain straps are popping up across your favorite brands and on all types of bags.<br /><br />Why the nostalgia push? Self-declared Chief Bag Officer and creator of the <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/y2kbags/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">@y2kbags Instagram account</a>, Alejandro V has a simple explanation: “All of us who once aspired to wear those designer pieces now actually have the means to purchase them — hence why the 2016 aesthetic has come roaring back in rapid-fire fashion!” </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Under-Arm Candy: Oversized Clutches</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960945.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Keep your shoulders free from the weight of your belongings and instead opt for an oversized clutch that can comfortably nestle under your arm. Many models carried these bags during the Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter 2026 runways, though the details varied. Designers are leveraging luxe leather, feathers and fringe, and belted and buckled silhouettes to update your typical <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-wedding-guest-dresses-outfits"">wedding guest</a> clutch. In other words, they aren’t exclusively meant for eveningwear attire.<br /><br />“Holding onto something so precious just feels fabulous and chic,” says Alejandro V. “I truly believe clutches are forever and should never go out of style — but I’m very happy they’re having a major comeback moment.” </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Woven Leather Bags (All Year Long) </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960948.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/woven-bag-baskets"">Woven leather bags</a> seem to peek out of people’s wardrobes in the spring and summer, so there’s no doubt that they’ll be everywhere again when the weather gets warmer. The most recent Fashion Month, however, has made a case for the versatility and timelessness of this high-quality style.<br /><br />“The Bottega Veneta influence here is undeniable,” notes Alejandro V. “From Daniel Lee to Matthieu Blazy, they did an incredible job reintroducing this silhouette and reminding people how timeless it really is. We’re at a point where consumers understand that great design can live forever.” <br /><br />Louie agrees — though he notes that the target market is shifting slightly, too. “There will also be more emphasis on men wearing bags, which continues to shift how these silhouettes are styled and perceived,” he said, giving a particular shoutout to a certain movie star and noted Bottega Veneta lover. “Thank you Jacob Elordi.”<br /><br />A woven bag — whether finished in leather or suede, and shaped as an oversized shoulder bag, utilitarian tote, or a trend-forward bucket bags — can tag along for nearly any activity. (I personally wear a woven suede tote as my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-work-bags-for-women"">work bag</a> throughout the year!) “You can dress it up or down, and there’s even the idea of passing it on someday as a family heirloom,” Alejandro V suggests. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Unzipped “Ladylike” Bags</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960943.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>While the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-trends-2025"">“ladylike” trend</a> as a whole re-emerged in 2025, the ladylike bag specifically will shine in 2026, top handles and all. There’s a crucially modern update at play, however: The traditionally dainty style (typically featuring a single strap or handle) is now being reimagined with unzipped, unclasped, and undone details.<br /><br />“I think this ties back to the [Hermès] Kelly being such an eternal icon — the ultimate single-strap, ladylike bag,” explains Alejandro V. More signature styles like the Dior Lady Bag have new interpretations too, like the <a href=""https://www.dior.com/en_us/fashion/news-fashion-shows/folder-news-and-events/dior-cigale-bag"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cigale bag</a>. You’ll also find the unfastened, single-strap style across Loewe, Fendi, and Toteme’s collections.  </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>(Non-Leopard) Animal Print Bags</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960940.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-trends"">Animal prints</a> will likely never go out of style, but there are points when they’re especially in vogue. Such patterns have been all over the Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter 2026 runways, most frequently presented through handbags. Even more interestingly, leopard print isn’t the most popular choice Instead, zebra and tiger prints, snakeskin, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-cow-print"">cowhide</a> dotted several designers’ collections — and they’re far more versatile than you may think.<br /><br />“Most animal prints are basically neutrals,” Alejandro V notes. “You can wear tiger and zebra print with almost anything! Cheetah, obviously. Or giraffe print à la early Dooney &amp; Bourke.” Typically available in neutral color palettes, these prints can be paired with your favorite wardrobe stapes to add a pop to any outfit.  </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>From The Office To The Alley: Doctor &amp; Bowling Bags</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960942.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Spacious and structured handbags have solidified themselves as the trend of all trends to carry around. On the runways, they’ve predominately popped up in leather, suede, and even snakeskin variations, and silhouettes ranging from the professional-looking house <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/handbag-trends-summer-2025"">doctor style</a> to the sportier <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/handbag-trends-spring-2025"">bowling bag</a>.<br /><br />These boxy and/or bulbous bags are perfect for all-day wear, though they’re particularly useful as your work bag. “These bags fit everything—and then some,” says Alejandro V. “A book, an iPad, a Hydro Flask… it’s truly the perfect chic little schlep bag without feeling overwhelmingly massive.” In other words, gone are the days of mini bags (though we’re sure that won’t last very long). </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Playful Pastel Bags</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960946.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>There isn’t just one <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-color-trends-2026"">trending color</a> that will cement itself as a 2026 handbag must-have. Instead, a rainbow of pretty pastels will be taking over. Expect to find <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/butter-yellow-runway-trend"">butter yellows</a>, baby pinks, mint greens, lilac purples, and frosted blues across every handbag category (including in some of the trending styles seen above ). See: The pale yellow cylindrical shoulder bags at Coach; the pink, purple, and blue pouches at Prada; as well as the pink lady bags and yellow quilted chain bags at Dior.<br /><br />Pastel purses will no doubt make their biggest presence during <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/target-roller-rabbit-collaboration-lookbook-shop"">the spring months</a>, but they can also add unexpected brightness to fall and winter outfits that need a bit of cheering up. </p>

<p>One of the most popular topics of discussion on the internet is the “<a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-kaleidescope/202507/is-male-loneliness-a-new-epidemic-or-an-age-old-struggle"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Male Loneliness Epidemic.</a>”  Many refer to it as the reason we have  <a href=""https://www.bupipedream.com/opinions/alpha-male-podcast-bros-and-their-grip-on-young-minds/163897/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">“Alpha male” podcasts</a> and an increasing number of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/oct/21/why-the-manosphere-clicked-for-young-men-a-visual-deep-dive"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">red pill-type content targeted towards Gen Z</a> and Gen Alpha young boys. Women are noticing that the men they date are participating in and exhibiting behaviors that make them very unlikeable and undatable. Loneliness is a serious subject, but when paired with misogyny and contempt towards women, it has become a punchline. When a woman posts about a bad dating experience or a <a href=""https://www.thecut.com/article/i-love-my-husband-who-hates-me.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">wife posts about</a> her careless and clueless husband, the jokes ensue. After each of these instances, I think the same thing:<em> straight men are simply not lonely enough. </em>The bar is on the floor, and these men can’t even meet that low standard. Maybe loneliness is what they deserve. </p>



<p>Watching this season of<em> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/02/11854927/love-is-blind-season-8-diversity"">Love is Blind</a>,</em> I am beginning to understand the male loneliness epidemic more and more. In the last batch of episodes of the dating reality series, I watched these men unravel and say things to their fiancées that were deeply concerning. The humiliation ritual masquerading as a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/love-is-blind-couples"">reality show</a> that we all binge-watch with glee is back with <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/features/love-is-blind-season-10-cast-instagrams"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Season 10, set in Ohio.</a> As <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2023/04/11340331/love-is-blind-4-couples-therapy"">Love Is Blind</a> </em>grows, there is always the question: “Are these people here for the right reasons?” I think there are better questions like, “are these men ready for commitment at all?”, “are they truly ready to let another person into their lives?”, and “are they willing to actually do the work it takes in a relationship?” For all of the aforementioned questions, the answer is giving a glaring no. Don’t they know this show is supposed to end in marriage?  </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/love-is-blind-season-10-keya-kevan-tyler-love-triangle-interview"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kevan is a great example</a> of someone who is not ready for the commitment that this experiment requires. His indecisiveness puts him in a love triangle with Tyler and Keya. In Episode 4 during the pods (the part of the series where couples are not allowed to see each others’ faces yet), Kevan says that he needs to “do the mature decision,” because he wants the “best for everybody” and “doesn’t want to let anybody down,” which made me roll my eyes and wish he would make up his mind. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Overall, the men on this season of <em>Love Is Blind</em> put their own lust over love repeatedly and show a complete lack of care or respect towards their fiancées. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In an interview on the <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/1cj7hCtiIOKh8a1fExWfCf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">podcast </a><em><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/1cj7hCtiIOKh8a1fExWfCf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">What’s the Reality</a></em><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/1cj7hCtiIOKh8a1fExWfCf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">? </a>with<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ad-love-is-blind-red-flags""> LIB Season 6 contestant AD</a>, Tyler revealed that what we didn’t see was Kevan’s admission that he was not ready to be married, and saying that if he were her, he would run. So, she did. All of Kevan’s flakiness led both <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vDBrw6KIgE"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tyler and Keya to leave him</a> in the pods. Throughout those episodes, Kevan seemed like he just didn’t want to lose the game he was playing. </p>



<p>In the pods, Emma was very vocal about <a href=""https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/love-is-blinds-emma-addresses-awkward-kid-talk-with-mikes-parents-excl/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">not wanting kids</a>, but her fiancé, Mike, kept trying to convince her she would be a great mom. He even explained this to her family by using the nonsensical analogy that if she can take care of a puppy, she can take care of a baby. This man should be alone until he can listen to a woman’s choices and respect them.  It was baffling when, in the same scene, Mike said he was open to what Emma wants, then backtracked and said having kids was non-negotiable. If it was so important to him, he should not have proposed to Emma. Mike said he was really banking on Emma her changing her mind and that he thought he could be the one to change it, if she could just see his “passion for wanting kids.” This is disrespectful to her wishes and a waste of both of their time.  <strong>  </strong></p>



<p>In true <em>Love Is Blind </em>fashion, many couples are having issues revolving around their physical appearances and the men feeling disappointed that the women they chose are not their “type.” We’ve seen this before on <em>Love is Blind</em>. We saw it in Season 2 with Shake &amp; Deepti and in Season 3 with Bartise &amp; Nancy. Of course, we know that people are human and physical attractiveness does matter in a relationship, but the show is called LOVE IS <em>BLIND</em>. </p>

<p>This season, this dilemma plagues three couples: Brittany and Devonta, Ashley and Alex, and Jessica and Chris. Brittany consistently told Devonta she didn’t feel secure in their relationship because he was not physically and verbally affectionate. He excused the distance by saying he was dealing with the death of his grandfather (who <a href=""https://www.eonline.com/news/1427931/love-is-blind-season-10-why-devonta-broke-no-phones-rule-in-pods"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">passed while the show was being filmed</a>). But Devonta also revealed that Brittany is not his physical “type” and that he has never dated a woman of color. Brittany is Black and Latina. When I interviewed Brittany, I asked how she felt watching the episodes back and hearing how Devonta felt about her and she said that in the back of her mind she felt Devonte’s distaste towards her.  Don’t worry girl, we could all feel it too. Devonta seems to be a self-hating mess and should be in therapy, not on reality TV. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>The worst man of all is Chris. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In Ohio, Ashley told <a href=""https://eu.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2026/02/25/love-is-blind-alex-henderson-donald-trump-vote/88707804007/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">self-proclaimed Trump supporter</a> and alleged<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveIsBlindNetflix/comments/1r8bj6t/i_think_alex_is_a_con_man/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> scammer Alex</a> that their intimacy was lacking. She brought up that they had not been intimate since arriving home from Mexico. He told her he was the one who initiated physical intimacy in Cabo and that now it was her turn. He then went on to say he was unaware that he could initiate sex with her while she is on her period. AGAIN, MEN AREN’T LONELY ENOUGH. Alex spends a majority of Episode 10 gaslighting Ashley because he can’t keep his story about his past exes straight. While Alex reassured Ashley that he is attracted to her, he told her to her face that she is not his typical “type” which is a horrible thing to repeatedly tell your partner. </p>

<p>The worst man of all is Chris. By now, you’ve probably seen <a href=""https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/tv-and-film/love-is-blind-chris-fusco-crossfit/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">the scene that has gone viral</a>. It shows Chris sitting across from his partner Jessica, a doctor, and telling her that he is not attracted to her because <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/netflixus/videos/chris-tells-jessica-hes-used-to-dating-women-who-work-out-all-the-time/1393006055935790/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">she doesn’t work out enough</a>. The audacity of this man. In the scene, Chris says to Jessica that he is not enjoying their sex life because he’s, “used to girls who do Pilates every day.” Mind you, in my opinion, Chris is a short five (and that’s being generous) with tiny hands, and Jessica is a hot doctor. </p>



<p>If that wasn’t bad enough, Chris also tells Jessica that he might be happier with Bri because he is more attracted to her. The more he explains himself as the episode goes on, the more openly disrespectful he becomes toward Jessica. He even loudly confesses to Bri and the other girls that Jessica was the worst sex he has ever had. Later in the evening, Chris even makes a sad attempt at reconciling with Jessica. He continously tries to get her to know he wasn’t trying to be mean all the while not understanding why what he said was so hurtful. Chris deserves worse than loneliness.  </p>



<p>Overall, the men in this season of <em>Love Is Blind</em> put their own lust over love repeatedly and show a complete lack of care or respect towards their fiancées. The <em>Love Is Blind </em>casting directors need to find men who actually <em>like</em> women. We live in a time when <a href=""https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/05/07/trump-spurs-global-rollback-rights-women-and-girls"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">women’s rights are being stripped </a>away, when <a href=""https://counciloncj.org/new-analysis-shows-8-increase-in-u-s-domestic-violence-incidents-following-pandemic-stay-at-home-orders/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">domestic violence is on the rise</a>, and when even in our highest moments, we <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/feb/25/distasteful-joke-us-hockey-star-hilary-knight-responds-to-trump-comments-on-womens-team"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">become the butt of the joke</a>. At the very least, we want to be able to enjoy our silly dating reality show without having to watch men degrade and disrespect the women they supposedly love.  </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>These men don’t want wives; they want unopinionated robots to put up with them. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Watching this season, it feels as though the men would rather treat the women more like experiments than human beings. They expect the women to bend, break, and mold themselves into who they want them to be, instead of seeing them for who they are and accepting the women they spent time getting to know in the pods. These men don’t want wives; they want unopinionated robots to put up with them. I would rather all of them just tell the truth and say, “This is not for me. I have some work to do.”   </p>



<p>At the end of these episodes, it is clear these men are not ready for marriage, for falling in love at all, or for considering their partners’ needs and wants. We have one more week before the wedding episodes and I hope Emma, Ashley, and Brittany follow Jessica, Keya, and Tyler’s lead and run for the hills!  There may be a male loneliness epidemic, but Season 10 of <em>Love Is Blind</em> is proving that maybe men are not nearly lonely enough. </p>

<p>March opens like a dream you’re half-awake inside. Mars enters Pisces, and suddenly motivation doesn’t look like grinding harder, it looks like following a feeling, a nudge, a quiet “this way.” <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">With Mercury retrograde</a> and Venus finishing her time in Pisces, the pace of life may feel slow, foggy, or oddly emotional. Plans drift, conversations may get blurry, and your energy comes in waves. Instead of forcing clarity, March begins by asking you to move differently… the vibe is softer, more intuitive, a little less obsessed with productivity and a little more curious about what your energy is actually trying to tell you.</p>



<p>Then comes March 3rd, when a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo</a> delivers a reality check with a highlighter and a to-do list. Virgo energy doesn’t care about the aesthetic of your life, it cares about what’s sustainable. This eclipse may expose burnout, perfectionism, control habits, or the quiet anxiety that comes from trying to hold everything together alone. Think of it less as chaos and more as a cosmic edit. Something inefficient, draining, or overcomplicated is ready to be simplified. If emotions spike, it’s probably because something in your life has been running on “I’ll deal with it later” for way too long.</p>



<p>The energy shifts noticeably after March 6th, when Venus enters Aries, bringing heat back into a very watery sky. Desire gets louder. Confidence comes back online. People start saying what they actually want instead of hinting. And on March 10th, momentum returns for real as Jupiter turns direct in Cancer after nearly five months retrograde. This is timeline acceleration energy. Opportunities that stalled begin moving. Emotional growth you’ve been doing quietly starts showing tangible results. If the first part of the year felt like therapy, this is where the plot starts moving again.</p>



<p>By March 18th, the New Moon in Pisces closes the eclipse chapter on a much gentler note. Where February’s Aquarius eclipse felt like a sudden break or shock (especially with its tense square to Uranus), this Pisces New Moon forms a harmonious connection to Uranus. Translation: the change sticks, but it feels supportive now. Less disruption, more alignment. Many people will notice emotional closure, creative clarity, or a quiet realization of how much they’ve actually grown. This new moon sets the tone for the next six months, and it carries a rare kind of hope… the grounded kind, not the delusional kind.</p>



<p>Then the real reset arrives. On March 20th at 10:46 a.m. EST, the sun enters Aries, marking the equinox and the start of the astrological new year. Even better? Mercury stations direct at 3:33 p.m. EST (yes, the numerology is doing the most). If the Fire Horse year that began in February felt like it hadn’t fully kicked in yet, this is the ignition. Energy moves forward. As the month closes, Saturn in Aries forms a supportive sextile to Pluto in Aquarius, signaling structural change behind the scenes… the kind that fuels real-world revolution. From immigration justice to protecting children from abuse to collective movements demanding accountability, this is slow power organizing itself. March ends on a softer note, though: Venus enters Taurus on March 30th, where she thrives. Comfort, stability, pleasure, and tangible love return. And honestly? After the emotional marathon of eclipse season, that kind of beauty feels earned.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, if you’ve been trying to push through exhaustion, anxiety, or that low-level feeling of being “on edge for no reason,” March is the month your body calls a meeting. The March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse</a> in Virgo lands in your wellness realm, and it’s less about dramatic endings and more about honest ones. Something about your daily rhythm, workload, or mental health habits has reached its limit. You might realize you’ve been running on adrenaline instead of alignment. This isn’t a failure moment, it’s a recalibration. What needs to be simplified? What actually supports you instead of just making you feel productive? <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Eclipse season is peaking</a>, and for you, the real power move is choosing sustainability over burnout.</p>



<p>By March 18th, the Pisces New Moon deepens a story that’s been building all month, especially with Mars moving through Pisces, your spiritual and healing zone. Translation: your energy isn’t meant for constant output right now, it’s meant for emotional processing, closure, and quiet breakthroughs that nobody else sees. You may feel more sensitive, more reflective, maybe even a little nostalgic. Lean into it… rest is productive. Therapy, journaling, long walks, random crying that actually feels good after… all valid. This new moon helps you release old emotional weight so you’re not dragging it into your next chapter.</p>



<p>And that next chapter? It arrives loud and clear. When the sun enters Aries on March 20th, it’s your solar return, your personal new year, and honestly, a full rebirth moment. After weeks of slowing down, clarity starts to click. Your energy comes back online, your confidence returns, and people notice you again. Just remember what the first half of the month taught you: your power isn’t just in your drive, it’s in your self-awareness. Move forward boldly, but don’t abandon the softness you fought to reclaim. This time, you’re not just starting over, you’re starting wiser.</p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, this month is asking you to get honest about where your joy has started to feel like pressure. The March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo</a> lights up your realm of romance, creativity, and self-expression, bringing a turning point around what (or who) truly lights you up. Something may culminate in your dating life, a creative project, or even your relationship with your inner child. If you’ve been performing happiness instead of actually feeling it, the eclipse will make that impossible to ignore. The lesson isn’t to control the outcome. It’s to release the need for things to look perfect and let your joy evolve into something more real, even if that means closing a chapter you once loved.</p>



<p>As the month unfolds, the emotional tone deepens. The March 18th Pisces new moon, amplified by Mars moving through Pisces all month, activates your friendship and community zone. You’re rethinking who you want around you, what spaces feel aligned, and where your energy actually grows instead of gets drained. Some Taurus placements may feel pulled to step back from certain social circles, take a quiet social media break, or reconnect with people who feel safe and inspiring. This isn’t isolation, it’s refinement. And because this new moon forms a supportive sextile to Uranus in Taurus, the changes you make now can feel surprisingly liberating, helping you step more confidently into a version of yourself that feels authentic, future-oriented, and unapologetically different.</p>



<p>When the sun enters Aries on March 20th, the energy turns inward, beginning a deeply restorative period for you. Think closure, healing, and tying up emotional loose ends before your birthday season arrives next month. You may crave more solitude, more sleep, more time to process everything this eclipse season stirred up, and that instinct is worth honoring. This is your cosmic reset phase. And as the month closes, Venus enters Taurus on March 30th, bringing your ruler home and turning the spotlight back on your magnetism, confidence, and capacity to attract what you’ve been quietly preparing yourself to receive.</p>

<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, March is less about moving faster and more about realizing which direction is actually worth your energy. The March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo</a> lands in your home and emotional foundation zone, bringing a turning point around living situations, family dynamics, or your inner sense of stability. Something may culminate, shift, or simply become impossible to ignore. If you’ve been pushing through without tending to your emotional needs, this eclipse calls a timeout. You don’t need to have everything figured out. You just need a space, physically or emotionally, where you can exhale and be honest about what security actually looks like for you now, not what it looked like before.</p>



<p>Career and visibility become the deeper storyline as the month unfolds. With Mars moving through Pisces all month, the March 18th Pisces new moon activates your professional zone, asking you to dream bigger about your path, but also to align your ambitions with meaning. You might feel pulled toward work that feels more creative, compassionate, or purpose-driven, even if the practical steps aren’t fully clear yet. This is less about forcing momentum and more about letting a new vision take shape. And because the energy has been slower, more reflective, you may notice that opportunities or ideas coming in now feel more intuitive than strategic. The real turning point arrives on March 20th, when the sun enters Aries, kicking oﬀ the astrological new year, and your ruler Mercury finally stations direct after its retrograde.</p>



<p>For you, this feels like mental fog lifting almost overnight. Conversations that stalled begin moving again. Decisions that felt confusing start making sense. Plans for your future, your community, or your long-term goals gain traction. The key is not to rush just because the momentum returns. You spent the past few weeks reassessing your direction for a reason. Now, you get to move forward with clarity instead of just speed.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831462.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, this month begins with a truth you can’t scroll past or emotionally sidestep. The March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo</a> lights up your communication and mindset zone, bringing a culmination around conversations, decisions, contracts, or the way you’ve been speaking to yourself. Something you’ve been overthinking, postponing, or sugarcoating reaches a turning point. You might finally say what you’ve been holding in, receive news that shifts your perspective, or realize that your mental load has been heavier than you admitted. If your anxiety spikes, that’s your cue to simplify. Not everything deserves your emotional bandwidth. Choose clarity over people-pleasing and honesty over emotional buffering.</p>



<p>Zooming out, this is a growth month for you. With Mars moving through Pisces all month, the March 18th Pisces new moon activates your expansion zone, pushing you toward new horizons in travel, education, publishing, or entrepreneurship. But this isn’t chaotic growth. It’s intuitive growth. You may feel drawn to learn something new, share your voice more publicly, or take a leap that feels spiritually aligned, even if it doesn’t make perfect logical sense yet. Because Mars has been energizing this area since the start of the month, this new moon feels like the green light to act on the vision that’s been quietly building.</p>



<p>Momentum really returns on March 20th, when the sun enters Aries, lighting up your career and legacy zone, and Mercury stations direct the same day. After weeks of emotional processing and big-picture reflection, things start moving forward professionally. Conversations about promotions, launches, visibility, or leadership may finally gain traction. The energy shifts from “What do I want my life to feel like?” to “Okay… let’s make it real.” Just remember, Cancer, your power this month isn’t in pushing harder. It’s in trusting that when your emotional alignment is right, your external progress follows.</p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831463.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, March opens with a reality check that’s less dramatic than you expected and more empowering than you realized you needed. The March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo</a> activates your money and self-worth zone, bringing a culmination around income, pricing, spending habits, or the way you’ve been valuing your time and energy. Something becomes very clear: where you’ve been undercharging, overgiving, or tying your worth to external validation. This eclipse isn’t here to stress you out financially, it’s here to recalibrate your standards. Think less “budget panic” and more “CEO energy.” What stays, what goes, and what actually reflects your value now?</p>



<p>At the same time, there’s deep emotional movement happening under the surface. With Mars in Pisces all month, the March 18th Pisces new moon activates your intimacy, healing, and shared-resources zone. Because Mars has been stirring this area since early March, you may already be processing trust issues, financial entanglements, emotional bonds, or old fears around vulnerability. This new moon helps you reset the story. It’s about merging wisely, not blindly. Whether that looks like restructuring debt, deepening a relationship, starting therapy, or finally releasing emotional baggage, the energy supports transformation that feels intentional instead of overwhelming.</p>



<p>Then the mood lifts. On March 20th, the sun enters Aries, opening up your expansion and adventure zone, and Mercury stations direct the same day. Plans around travel, education, publishing, or a bold new direction start moving forward again. You’ll feel your confidence return, but this time it’s grounded in the emotional and financial clarity you just gained. And honestly, Leo, that’s the glow up this month is really about: not louder confidence, but quieter certainty that you actually know your worth and where you’re headed next.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831464.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, this month’s March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse</a> in your sign is personal, powerful, and, if we’re being honest, a little exhausting. You’ve been part of the Virgo–Pisces eclipse storyline for nearly two years, and this moment feels like a turning point in how you see yourself. Something about your identity, your habits, or the version of you that’s been operating on overdrive is ready to be released. For many Virgos, the hardest part isn’t the change itself, it’s letting go of the need to control the outcome. This eclipse asks you to loosen your grip, to trust that not everything needs to be optimized or analyzed before it unfolds. What feels like disruption is actually liberation. You’re not losing control, you’re outgrowing the pressure to carry everything alone.</p>



<p>Two weeks later, the March 18th new moon in Pisces activates your partnership zone, and it’s amplified by the fact that Mars has been in Pisces all month and the North Node is already pulling you toward deeper emotional growth here. This isn’t just about romance, though love could absolutely be part of the story. It’s about rewriting your patterns around closeness, boundaries, and receiving support. If you’re used to being the reliable one, the fixer, the emotionally organized person in the room, this lunation asks you to name your needs and let someone meet you there. This is one of the most powerful resets for love, connection, and mutual care that you’ve had in years, but only if you allow vulnerability to be part of the equation.</p>



<p>By the time Aries Season begins on March 20th, kicking off the astrological new year, the focus turns toward emotional courage and deeper transformation. You may feel less interested in surface-level dynamics and more drawn to honesty, intimacy, and energetic alignment in every area of your life. This season pushes you to release what drains you, financially, emotionally, or energetically, and invest your time where there’s real reciprocity. The version of you emerging now isn’t the one who manages<br />everything perfectly. It’s the one who trusts their timing, their intuition, and their worth enough to stop carrying what was never theirs to hold in the first place.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831465.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, if the past few weeks have felt like an emotional detox you didn’t exactly sign up for, you’re not imagining it. The March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse</a> in Virgo activates your rest, healing, and closure zone, bringing something behind the scenes to a turning point. Old stress, quiet resentment, burnout, or even a pattern of overgiving without replenishing yourself may come to the surface now. This isn’t a dramatic external eclipse for you, it’s an internal one. Your system is asking for less noise, less pressure, and more honesty about what you’re carrying that no one else even sees. If you feel the urge to pull back, sleep more, or cancel plans, listen. This is release work, not retreat out of weakness.</p>



<p>The March 18th new moon in Pisces resets your wellness, work, and lifestyle zone, and it’s amplified by the fact that Mars has been in Pisces all month, building momentum around your habits, energy levels, and boundaries with your time. This is your chance to redesign your schedule so it actually supports your nervous system instead of draining it. Because the North Node is also in Pisces, this isn’t just about productivity, it’s about alignment. Where are you overcommitting? Where are you saying yes out of obligation instead of capacity? Small changes made now, to your routine, your workload, or your self-care, can shift your entire quality of life over the next six months.</p>



<p>By the time Aries Season begins on March 20th, marking the astrological new year, your attention turns fully toward relationships. This is your partnership zone lighting up, and after the emotional clearing you’ve been doing, the dynamic between you and others may start to look different. You’re entering a period of renegotiation, not necessarily conflict, but honesty about needs, effort, and balance. The key is to bring the same energy you’ve been learning privately into your connections: clearer boundaries, clearer communication, and less people-pleasing. The version of you stepping into this next cycle isn’t here to keep the peace at your own expense, it’s here to create relationships that feel peaceful for you too.</p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831467.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, this month opens with a reminder that your future is changing because your circles are changing too. The March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo</a> lights up your community, friendship, and long-term vision zone, bringing a turning point around who you’re aligned with and where you’re headed next. Some connections may naturally drift, a group dynamic could shift, or you might realize a goal you’ve been chasing no longer fits the person you’re becoming. This eclipse isn’t about isolation, it’s about alignment. If something feels like it’s falling away, it’s likely making space for people and opportunities that actually match your current frequency, not your past one.</p>



<p>As the emotional dust settles, the energy gets sweeter, lighter, and honestly, more fun. The March 18th new moon in your fellow Water sign of Pisces activates your romance, creativity, and joy zone, and it’s amplified by the fact that Mars has been in Pisces all month, already stirring your desire to express yourself more freely. The North Node here suggests this isn’t just a mood, it’s growth. You’re learning how to take pleasure seriously again, whether that means dating, creating, performing, flirting with life, or reconnecting with your inner child. This is one of the best new moons of the year for opening your heart, but the real magic happens when you stop waiting for the “right time” and let yourself be seen as you are.</p>



<p>When Aries Season begins on March 20th and the astrological new year kicks in, your focus shifts toward your daily life, work rhythms, and physical energy. The question becomes: <em>how do you build a lifestyle that supports the version of you that’s emerging? </em>This is where inspiration meets structure. You may feel motivated to change your schedule, set stronger boundaries around your time, or commit to habits that protect your energy instead of draining it. Just be mindful of the shadow here, trying to do everything at once and burning out in the process. This season isn’t about proving your strength. It’s about creating a routine that lets your strength last.</p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831468.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, March opens with a moment that puts your public life under a very real spotlight. The March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo</a> activates your career, reputation, and long- term direction zone, bringing a culmination around your work or the role you’ve been playing in the world. A project may wrap up, recognition could arrive, or you might suddenly realize that a path you’ve been pushing toward doesn’t actually reflect who you are anymore. This eclipse isn’t here to create chaos, it’s here to clarify your definition of success. If something shifts or ends, it’s because you’re outgrowing performative ambition and moving toward purpose-driven direction.</p>



<p>Behind the scenes, your emotional foundation is also being rewritten. The March 18th new moon in Pisces activates your home, family, and inner-security zone, and it’s amplified by the fact that Mars has been in Pisces all month, stirring movement around living situations, boundaries with family, or your need for a space that truly feels like yours. With the North Node here, this isn’t just logistical, it’s emotional growth. You’re learning what stability actually means for you, not what it’s supposed to look like. Whether that means redecorating, relocating, repairing a family dynamic, or simply protecting your peace more intentionally, this new moon supports creating a life that feels safe enough for your next chapter to grow.</p>



<p>When Aries Season begins on March 20th, kicking off the astrological new year, the mood shifts dramatically, and you’ll likely feel it immediately. Your creativity, confidence, and romantic energy come back online. After the heavier emotional and professional recalibrations of early March, this season reminds you that life isn’t just about responsibility, it’s about joy, expression, and taking risks that feel exciting again. Just watch the shadow of overcommitting to every opportunity or chasing thrills without pacing yourself. The real power of this moment is choosing what actually lights you up and putting your energy there, instead of scattering it everywhere just because you can. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831469.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, March begins by widening your perspective, whether you asked for that expansion or not. The March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse</a> in fellow earth sign Virgo activates your growth, travel, education, and belief zone, bringing a turning point around the direction you see your life heading. A plan may change, a mindset you’ve relied on could be challenged, or you might realize you’ve outgrown a path that once felt secure. This eclipse isn’t here to destabilize you, it’s here to stretch you. If something shifts unexpectedly, the deeper question isn’t “How do I control this?” but “What new possibility is trying to open that I couldn’t see before?”</p>



<p>At the same time, your day-to-day world is getting busier, faster, and more emotionally charged. The March 18th new moon in Pisces resets your communication, learning, and local environment zone, and it’s amplified by the fact that Mars has been moving through Pisces all month. Conversations that have been building finally move forward, ideas gain momentum, and your schedule may fill up quickly. With the North Node here, this isn’t just about staying busy, it’s about using your voice differently. You’re learning to communicate with more intuition, more softness, and more honesty instead of defaulting to efficiency or restraint. What you say, write, or share now could shape your path over the next six months.</p>



<p>When Aries Season begins on March 20th and the astrological new year kicks in, your attention shifts inward toward home, family, and emotional stability. This energy can feel tense at times, since Aries forms a challenging angle to your sign, bringing pressure around where you live, how you rest, or how much responsibility you’re carrying for everyone else. The growth here is learning that strength doesn’t mean holding everything together alone. If emotions run higher or domestic matters demand your attention, it’s an invitation to build a foundation that actually supports you, not just the version of you who keeps everything running. This next chapter isn’t about pushing harder. It’s about making sure the life you’re building has space for you inside it.</p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831471.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, March opens with a deeper emotional storyline than you might normally prefer to sit with. The March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo</a> activates your intimacy, shared resources, and emotional entanglement zone, bringing a turning point around trust, finances, or energetic exchanges. Something may come to light about who or what you’ve been investing your time, money, or emotional bandwidth into. This eclipse isn’t about loss, it’s about balance. If a dynamic feels heavy, one-sided, or draining, it’s asking to be renegotiated or released. The real growth here is recognizing that independence doesn’t mean avoiding vulnerability, it means choosing connections that feel safe and reciprocal.</p>



<p>The energy then shifts toward rebuilding your sense of stability and self-worth. The March 18th new moon in Pisces activates your income and values zone, and it’s amplified by the fact that Mars has been moving through Pisces all month, already stirring movement around your finances, spending habits, or how you price your time and talent. With the North Node here, this isn’t just about making more money, it’s about aligning your work and income with your actual worth. Opportunities could emerge over the next six months, but the real reset starts internally: what you believe you deserve, and what you’re no longer willing to undervalue.</p>



<p>When Aries Season begins on March 20th and the astrological new year kicks off, your pace picks up quickly. Your communication, networking, and daily movement zone comes alive, bringing more conversations, ideas, short trips, and opportunities to connect. You may feel mentally energized and ready to move things forward after a slower, more reflective start to the month. Just be mindful of the shadow of Aries here, saying yes to everything and scattering your energy. The power of this season isn’t in doing more, it’s in choosing the conversations, projects, and connections that actually move your life in the direction you’ve been quietly preparing for.</p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831472.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, this month is personal, defining, and a little bit emotional, even by your standards. The March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo</a> lands in your partnership zone, bringing a turning point in a close relationship or in the way you show up in one-on-one dynamics. A connection may deepen, shift, or reach a moment of truth where the balance between giving and receiving becomes impossible to ignore. This isn’t necessarily about endings, but it is about clarity. Where have you been overextending, accommodating, or hoping someone would meet you halfway without actually asking for what you need? This eclipse pushes you toward healthier reciprocity, even if the conversation feels uncomfortable at first.</p>



<p>Two weeks later, the new moon in your sign on the 18th marks a powerful personal reset, and it carries extra weight because Mars has been in Pisces since the beginning of the month, building your momentum, confidence, and drive. With the North Node also in Pisces, this isn’t just another birthday-season intention moment, it’s a six-month turning point in your identity and direction. You may feel the urge to change your look, your routine, your goals, or even the way you introduce yourself to the world. The energy is asking you to stop waiting for permission and start acting like the version of you you’ve been imagining.</p>



<p>When Aries Season begins on March 20th and the astrological new year kicks off, your focus shifts toward money, stability, and self-worth. After such a personal reset, the question becomes practical: how do you support this new version of yourself financially and energetically? Opportunities to increase income, renegotiate your value, or take your talents more seriously may start to appear. Just watch the shadow of impulsive spending or jumping too quickly into financial risks. This next chapter’s about building something steady that reflects the confidence you’re finally stepping into.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961267.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p><strong><em>Spoilers ahead</em></strong>: There’s a moment in <em>56 Days</em> when the show’s central con is revealed: Ciara (Dove Cameron) didn’t meet Oliver (Avan Jogia) by chance at the supermarket. She planned it. She’d been watching him, taking <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/bring-back-physical-photo-albums"">photos</a>, keeping notes. She orchestrated the entire encounter to get close to a man she had reason to hate. By any definition, this is manipulation. This is the setup for a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/what-is-love-bombing"">love bombing</a> scenario, or worse. And yet, by the end of the show, we’re supposed to be rooting for them to stay together. To build a life and to have their happy ending.</p>



<p>Dove Cameron is aware of this contradiction. When asked directly if audiences will excuse the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/green-flags-not-red-flags-dating-relationships"">red flags</a> both characters exhibit, she doesn’t hesitate: “I don’t think they’ll excuse any of it. They shouldn’t.” But then she pauses, because she knows what actually happens.</p>



<h3>The attractiveness loophole</h3>



<p>There’s this recurring theme in <em>56 Days</em>: one where Oliver does something genuinely alarming, or Ciara reveals another layer of her deception, and the camera lingers on their faces. Both of them are beautiful, the tension is unbearable, and somewhere in that moment, the audience’s moral objections start to soften.</p>



<p>“I don’t think the audience will completely brush it off,” Cameron says when asked about whether attractiveness gives characters a pass. She’s repeating herself because she knows it’s not true. Or rather, she knows the nuance: audiences <em>shouldn’t</em> excuse it, but they will. “But I do think they’ll start to excuse it more and more as it is clear that they’re both exhibiting red flags,” she continues. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>I think when the playing field gets more levelled, it’ll be like, oh, so these two are just fucked up. They’re perfect for each other.</p><cite>DOVE CAMERON</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>This is the moment the show wins; the psychological shift happens for the audience when both people are compromised equally. When neither one is the victim, and neither one is the villain, audiences stop trying to pick a side. And in that refusal to judge, they actually end up rooting for the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/dating-trends-tinder-2026"">relationship</a>, not despite the red flags, but because of them.</p>



<h3>The con works because we want it to</h3>



<p>Ciara’s plan to get revenge on Oliver, the man she believes destroyed her family, doesn’t survive first contact with reality. She falls for him, or she decides to love him anyway. The show intentionally leaves this deliberately ambiguous. But what’s not ambiguous is what happens next: she kills his abusive therapist to protect him and then she chooses him and they run. Oliver, meanwhile, carries his own devastating secret: he killed someone in high school and let his best friend take the fall. Oliver’s been living a lie his entire life, with his abusive therapist weaponising that secret to control him.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961024.png?width=1024&amp;height=538&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A269"" /></figure>



<p>Neither of them is redeemable in any conventional sense; both have done deeply unforgivable things. And yet the show ends with them together, with a child, living in hiding. Not because they’ve been punished or because they’ve atoned, but because they’ve chosen each other.</p>



<p>That confusion in that inability to pin down who’s hurting whom, who’s the predator and who’s the prey, is precisely where the audience’s judgment collapses. We’re not meant to figure it out; we’re meant to accept the ambiguity, and we do. Because they’re beautiful and they’re damaged in interesting ways, where we as the audience almost want to save them. But to be blunt, that’s because they’re hot and the chemistry between them is undeniable.</p>



<h3>The moral we’re actually learning</h3>



<p>The uncomfortable truth <em>56 Days</em> presents is this: we say we want to identify red flags and that we want to protect ourselves from manipulation. But when presented with two attractive, deeply flawed people who are essentially destroying each other and everyone around them, we don’t actually want to look away, and we don’t necessarily want them to be held accountable.</p>



<p>Cameron’s honesty about this is refreshing. She doesn’t pretend the show is teaching us something virtuous. She doesn’t argue that we <em>should</em> root for these characters. She just acknowledges what’s actually happening: “I think that’s when we’ll get into a zone of more, like, I have no idea who’s got the upper hand here.” Jogia agrees and goes further. “You can have all the red flags in the world, but sometimes it doesn’t matter who they are,” he says. “In some cases, they usually go hand in hand with a real connection.”</p>



<p>Jogia points out that he’s not saying to ignore the flags, he’s highlighting that the presence of red flags doesn’t automatically disqualify a relationship from being real. That genuine feeling can coexist with genuine danger, and that when both people are compromised, when both are beautiful and broken in the same ways, the red flags become almost irrelevant to whether we believe in the connection. We reach a point where the question of who’s manipulating whom stops mattering. And at that point of moral surrender, the show achieves something genuinely dark: it makes us complicit in the fiction that love, real, genuine love, can exist in a space of pure mutual corruption.</p>



<p>Maybe it can. Maybe that’s even true in real life, sometimes. But <em>56 Days</em> doesn’t let us off easy by pretending it’s beautiful. It just shows us that we’ll accept it anyway. As long as everyone involved is attractive enough.</p>

However, there’s one retailer that always claims a sizable chunk of my paycheck (just consult my order histories) — and that’s <a href=""http://nordstrom.com"">Nordstrom</a>.  <br /><br />Having grown up in the heyday of mall culture, I spent endless hours among the impeccably lit displays at my local Nordstrom counter, swatching and spritzing to my heart’s content.

(I especially love it on my tattoos; it makes them gleam as if they’re brand new.) In the months that I’ve incorporated it into my body care ritual, I feel like my skin is softer and more even-toned than ever, thanks to ingredients like mineral-rich seaweed (a popular skincare ingredient said to improve elasticity) and hydrating passion fruit,  açaí, babassu and rice bran oils. It also has a light citrusy scent that isn’t overpowering and plays nice when layered with my fragrance of choice.” <em>— Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer</em> <br /><br /><strong>OSEA</strong> Undaria Algae™ Body Oil, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fundaria-algae-body-oil%2F5812429%3F"">Nordstrom</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1196"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961246.png?auto=webp&amp;width=780&amp;height=1196&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=15:23"" width=""780"" /><figcaption><h2>Living Proof Moisture Rescue Mask<br /></h2><br />""I’m only a third of the way through my first tub of Living Proof Moisture Rescue Mask, and I’ve already added another to my Nordstrom list — it’s that good. I’m trying to grow my hair long, which means I’ve been putting off hairdresser appointments. My stylist once told me that if I really want to stretch them out, I should invest in a quality hair mask and use it instead of a conditioner — and she was right. Packed with deeply moisturizing shea butter, I leave it on for five minutes while I wash my face and body, and the moisture barrier–boosting oils mean my hair has never looked or felt shinier or smoother. The brand claims it protects against dryness for up to three washes, and I can confirm that it does."" <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director</em><br /><br /><strong>Living Proof</strong> Moisture Rescue Mask, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fmoisture-rescue-mask%2F8736350%3F"">Nordstrom</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1196"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961244.png?auto=webp&amp;width=780&amp;height=1196&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=15:23"" width=""780"" /><figcaption><h2>Dior Peachy Glow Eau de Parfum<br /></h2><br />""It was the beautiful, elegant bottle that first caught my eye, but the fragrance inside has me hooked. I adore anything peach, but it can sometimes smell juvenile or overly sweet. Not this one. After trying a tester, I can confirm that the creamy jasmine and vanilla whipped cream notes make it almost tropical — like the exciting moment before heading out for dinner on vacation, getting ready after a day at the beach.

Its star ingredient is deeply moisturizing 1% colloidal oatmeal, which soothes, heals, and protects the skin. Most dermatologists I know often recommend this ingredient for dry, flaky patches.

The cream is rich and indulgent, and I truly savor the time spent massaging it into my limbs after a shower. The scent is lightly floral, a reminder that — even amid blizzards and rainstorms — spring is just around the corner. Beyond the brand’s moisturizing, healing TFC8 complex of amino acids and vitamins, it contains skin-smoothing shea butter (essential for scaly legs like mine), niacinamide to support the skin barrier and prevent body breakouts, and polysaccharides, long chains of sugar molecules that boost hydration. I’m already one tub down and can’t wait to grab another."" <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director</em><br /><br /><strong>Augustinus Bader</strong> Geranium Rose Body Cream, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fgeranium-rose-body-cream%2F8777317%3F"">Nordstrom</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1196"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961234.png?auto=webp&amp;width=780&amp;height=1196&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=15:23"" width=""780"" /><figcaption><h2>Dr. Dennis Gross DermInfusions Plump + Repair Lip Treatment<br /></h2><br />""One thing about me?

Simply press the base of the product to release the glossy balm and swipe. Not only does it give lips a juicy wash of color, but it’s so hydrating that I’m convinced it makes them look twice as plump. That’s thanks to the hyaluronic acid, moisturizing squalane, and a mix of nourishing waxes and plant oils.

Like MAC, the brand has also been very selective of its retail presence, but recently announced that it was entering Nordstrom’s rarified beauty assortment.

I was so impressed. My all time favorite, though, has to be the Glowgasm Beauty Wand Highlighter (especially the shade Peachgasm), which I use as a cream blush. Unlike others, which are packed with chunky, glittery pigments, this is so finely-milled and appears like a glossy filter on the skin.

The first Westman item I bought was the Face Trace Contour Stick. I love the shade ‘Biscuit’ because it has a cooler understone so it doesn’t appear orange like some other contour or bronzing products I’ve tried. The texture is also so creamy and melts into the skin easily.

<p>That’s how I felt in 2002, when at the age of 16, I had just learned about the brutal murder of a 17-year-old <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/06/11434832/transgender-latina-beauty-pageant-contestants"">trans Latina</a> named <a href=""https://abc7news.com/post/who-is-gwen-araujo-timeline-documentary-transgender-murder/12451079/"">Gwen Araujo</a>. Reading the gruesome details of how young cis men with whom she’d been sexually active with killed her because she was trans shook me to my core forever. I often imagined her fate would inevitably be my future — that not only being a Boricua, not only being a woman, but also being a trans woman would prove itself to be perilous as I navigated the still-new-to-me world of dating and the cisgender men who populate it. </p>



<p>Why would I put myself out there when the stakes are so high? But then again, wouldn’t you do the same in the effort to find the love you’ve always felt you deserved?</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Dating while trans and Latina comes with unique and often systemically violent challenges.”</p><cite>ANGELICA CHRISTINA</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Multiple studies have found that <a href=""https://illumin.usc.edu/swipe-by-color-the-pitfalls-of-online-dating-for-women-of-color/"">online dating is statistically worse for women of color</a>. And dating while trans and Latina comes with unique and often systemically violent challenges. The stereotypes abound: that we’re all sex workers; that we’re little more than a fetish for closeted, cisgender men; that we’re not seeking love or partnership, or, just as hurtful, that we’re not worth it. I’ve downloaded <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/latine-dating-apps-successful-stories-couples"">dating apps</a> with a full heart and hope that I could find love in a truly hopeless place, but cisgender men have taken it upon themselves to degrade and demoralize me at every turn. Rather than offering me a simple, “Hello, how are you?” I’m often met with, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CCHHNEgn791/?img_index=1"">“How much?”</a></p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961089.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=628&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=256%3A157"" /></figure></div>



<p>When putting myself out there in the dating pool, I run the constant risk of exposing myself to prejudice (such as being labeled the “spicy” Latina), misogyny, and transmisia that runs rampant on dating apps. I’m also put in direct contact with cis men who have historically voted my rights away, strip me of my bodily autonomy, and align themselves with hateful ideologies while simultaneously seeking to take advantage of my body for their pleasure. It’s daunting and exhaustive, to put it mildly, and I’m sure you understand why I delete the apps as quickly as I download them.</p>



<p>Trans Latinas deserve better in dating, both online and in person, just as all Latinas do. And it begins with our communities dismantling the assumptions it makes and perpetuates about me and my sisters — and with holding Latino men to a higher standard, one that holds them accountable to the harm they cause and the inner work they need to do.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“I’m also put in direct contact with cis men who have historically voted my rights away, strip me of my bodily autonomy, and align themselves with hateful ideologies while simultaneously seeking to take advantage of my body for their pleasure.”</p><cite>ANGELICA CHRISTINA</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>To be clear, I recognize that cis women have it bad on dating apps, too. Latinas, like all other women, deserve the truest forms of love, compassion, safety, and care from our partners. Our heritage is not a crux, nor a deterrent, nor a fetish inviting men to sexualize our bodies without our consent. Our hair, our bodies, and our skin tones are sacred, representative of the diversity of our Latinidad, and should be treated as such. Yet there’s an added layer of exploitation that trans women are forced to endure — and it’s utterly violating.</p>



<p>I’ve sifted through hundreds of messages from complete strangers who feel comfortable enough expressing that they’d like to “try me for their ‘first time,’” as if I’m a chemistry set to be experimented with rather than the human being that I am. Forget “Hi, how are you?” or “What are you up to?” as predictable, if boring, openers. I’ve received messages about lurid fantasies without my consent, and have been repeatedly dehumanized and denied intimacy, and told that my life does not matter if not for what my body can do to satisfy cis men’s desires. The number of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DIQUENauYxl/?img_index=7"">unsolicited nudes</a> I’ve received truly cannot be counted, despite clear warnings in my bio and in messages to not send such photos. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961090.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=978&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A489"" /></figure>



<p>It’s a problem the apps are aware of: A new law in the U.K. mandates that <a href=""https://www.the-independent.com/bulletin/news/cyberflashing-law-dating-apps-social-media-b2896534.html"">dating apps have to block these photos</a> and Bumble <a href=""https://bumble.com/en-us/the-buzz/bumble-unsolicited-lewd-nude-images-virginia-texas"">has published advocacy work </a>about such sexual harassment, but am I hopeful that things will change? Not particularly. The LGBTQ-focused dating app Grindr also <a href=""https://help.grindr.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008783953-Consent?_gl=1*guunkc*_ga*MTMwMTY0MDkxOS4xNzcwNTM0MTc1*_ga_3ZJKH4GWHP*czE3NzA1MzQxNzQkbzEkZzEkdDE3NzA1MzQzMTYkajU0JGwwJGgw"">boasts about the importance of consent</a> and highlights the predatory nature of <a href=""https://www.grindr.com/blog/unsolicited-dick-pic"">unsolicited nudes</a>, yet <a href=""https://www.attitude.co.uk/uncategorised/grindr-must-to-do-more-to-crack-down-on-illegal-unsolicited-nudes-404274/"">the app is still rife</a> with cis men preying upon users seeking deeper connections than just the physical. I’m often left feeling as though there are no safe spaces for me to seek out a monogamous relationship without the risk of being sexually harassed, which can feel extraordinarily lonely.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Latinas, like all other women, deserve the truest forms of love, compassion, safety, and care from our partners. Our heritage is not a crux, nor a deterrent, nor a fetish inviting men to sexualize our bodies without our consent.”</p><cite>ANGELICA CHRISTINA</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>And that’s only the latest layer of anti-transness I’ve been subjected to throughout my life, particularly given that I grew up as a hyper-feminine child with a penchant for Disney princess films and pop divas like my idol, Christina Aguilera. Both my Puerto Rican household and the broader neighborhood I grew up in — a low-income, primarily Black and brown corner of East Harlem in New York City — prioritized <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/08/11487974/hulu-film-miguel-wants-to-fight-challenges-machismo"">machismo</a> over all else. I never felt the safety or permission to embrace my most authentic self, not in my neighborhood, neither in school, and certainly not in my own home. I cried, prayed, begged, and pleaded for acceptance, but, instead, I was met with denial and physical abuse.</p>



<p>It’s the sort of machismo that has historically shamed young Latine men and boys when they express human emotions. The kind that pressures Black and brown boys to be hyper-masculine, hardened, and brimming with toxicity while demanding that women and girls  “know their place.” The kind that expects women to prioritize having children and cooking for the man of the house above all else, fully ignoring the reality that some cisgender <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2026/01/16/josh-hawley-senate-hearing-abortion-pills-men-pregnant/88198354007/"">women aren’t able to have children</a>, and some simply don’t want to. </p>



<p>It’s a stereotype that is as damaging to men as it is to women. Men and boys of color are never given permission to cry, to be soft, to embrace the divine feminine. It’s the sort of harm that informs and impacts the way cis men treat women. It’s the kind of violence that is deadly to both trans and cis women.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“I’ve received messages about lurid fantasies without my consent, and have been repeatedly dehumanized and denied intimacy, and told that my life does not matter if not for what my body can do to satisfy cis men’s desires.”</p><cite>ANGELICA CHRISTINA</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>It’s also, hopefully, on the way out: A survey published by the Pew Research Center in 2024<a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2024/12/17/what-u-s-latinos-say-about-machismo/""> found</a> that 73% of respondents don’t like machismo. They overwhelmingly said that the concept is a bad thing. The intersection of machismo and anti-trans sentiment is less studied, but the overwhelming emphasis that machismo is related to masculinity and gender-based roles is plenty damning. That only one in five people who are aware of machismo and admit to operating among those guidelines is all the proof you need that this isn’t a trait to uphold or celebrate.</p>



<p>Still, it’s a factor that likely contributed to some of the worst encounters of my life — of the man who asked me out when I was 17, only to sexually assault me several times. Of the messages I received on early online dating sites like TSDating and Craigslist’s romance section, where my inboxes were inundated with propositions for sex, unsolicited nude photos, and graphic details of what these men wanted to subject to me. Of the dates gone sour, like the man who later admitted to fetishizing my transness and the complete prince who was scared of what other people thought.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961091.jpg?width=769&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=769%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>No doubt some of these men are emboldened by the current political climate and U.S. President Donald Trump, a <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/US/anniversary-hush-money-conviction-trump-continues-fight-criminal/story?id=122325361"">convicted felon</a> who was also found <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/trump-rape-carroll-trial-fe68259a4b98bb3947d42af9ec83d7db"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">liable of sexual abuse</a>. No doubt the current administration’s single-minded efforts to <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-transgender-laws-asylum-persecution-canada-b2832107.html"">demonize and</a> <a href=""https://www.them.us/story/trump-admin-fbi-trans-nihilistic-violent-extremists-terrorist"">criminalize</a> trans, nonbinary, gender non-conforming, two-spirit, and other queer human beings only furthers a catastrophe of blatant hatred and violence toward us. (Trump’s re-election campaign spent <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/22/nx-s1-5188573/transgender-gender-affirming-care-trump-abortion-hyde-amendment?utm_campaign=npr&amp;utm_term=nprnews&amp;utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawPt8_BleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETFYZ2lmS1pOM1Q4R0lBN0lDc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHu3jGKzjebu4QuanTFV1ik114RUc3G0N_v96b4xZy7mFt968nLIvnZUz3SQI_aem_7dHoE05RaW_kuMDBc0Pxwg"">$222 million on anti-trans ads</a> during the 2024 election cycle, which sadly resonated with Americans on all sides.) And no doubt the constant efforts to smear us as “groomers,” or as the cause of societal moral unraveling is meaningfully and irreparably violent. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“What I don’t want is a man to instantly degrade me when learning that I’m trans — an identity that I’m proud of, but one that isn’t an invitation for harassment or abuse.”</p><cite>ANGELICA CHRISTINA</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Add all of this to the fact that, statistically, <a href=""https://chprc.org/publications/fatal-violence-against-black-transgender-women-in-the-united-states/"">Black trans women</a> and other trans women of color are impacted by violence and murder at staggering rates. We’re brutally targeted on a daily basis by the same cis men and women who oversexualize us, as proven by Pornhub’s 2025 Year in Review: Trans porn was rated <a href=""https://www.pornhub.com/insights/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1_pornhub-insights-2025-year-in-review-most-viewed-categories-worldwide.png"">the second-most viewed category</a> on their website.</p>



<p>For most of my life, I’ve longed for connection, intimacy, romance, and kindness from potential partners. Far too often, I’ve watched longingly as my friends and chosen family have found love in the most unlikely places, only to feel left behind myself. I’ve dreamed of finding my príncipe azul, my ride-or-die guy, my person. I’ve fantasized about what a dream date would look like — a lovely candlelight dinner paired with a glass of wine and effortless conversation  — and about traveling to far-off destinations. I’d love nothing more than to have a partner that buys me flowers just because it’s Sunday, and a relationship built on trust and intimacy. I long to be courted, romanced, and perhaps even married someday.</p>



<p>What I don’t want is a man to instantly degrade me when learning that I’m trans — an identity that I’m proud of, but one that isn’t an invitation for harassment or abuse. I deserve someone who sees me for more than the oversexualized stigmas and preconceived notions that follow trans women, Latinas, and those of us who live at the intersection like a plague. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Even in my darkest moments, I always come back to the belief that someday, I will find my person. That I will find the kind of love that heals generational wounds, the kind where machismo cannot bloom.”</p><cite>ANGELICA CHRISTINA</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>As an activist and advocate with a platform, my life’s work is rooted in fighting for trans rights. We’re human beings deserving of love, care, and compassion. That extends beyond politics, to community care and romantic relationships. Trans Latinas deserve better in dating, both online and in person. My sisters and I deserve safety and trust. We deserve the kind of love that lasts a lifetime. And it begins with our communities dismantling the false assumptions it makes and perpetuates about us. It requires holding the older generations to account when they make an offhand remark, and challenging the men in our lives when they say bigoted things. We are not anyone’s teachers, therapists, or sex workers. The deeper, inner work of healing and being better men is yours to address and yours alone. We should demand more action from the dating apps, and we need to hold politicians to account for the hate they perpetuate.</p>



<p>Even in my darkest moments, I always come back to the belief that someday, I will find my person. That I will find the kind of love that heals generational wounds, the kind where machismo cannot bloom.<br /></p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960745.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cara-delevingne"">Cara Delevingne</a> just told me I have “fantastic brows,” and I’m not okay. Well, that’s not entirely true: I’m genuinely overwhelmed with joy at the compliment, and not only because Cara Delevingne is <em>my </em>brow icon — <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eyebrows"">brows</a> are her ultimate beauty signature. (In my mind, this is akin to if Michaelangelo complimented me at a Paint &amp; Sip.)  </p>



<p>The L’Oréal ambassador and multi-hyphenate has had a packed schedule as of late, including attending the recent <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wuthering-heights-margot-robbie-alison-oliver-interview""><em>Wuthering Heights</em></a> premiere to support her friend Margot Robbie. “I’ve seen it twice,” she gushes, adding that while she doesn’t typically love period films, the beauty moments were nothing short of mesmerizing. “Margot’s skin and freckles are so gorgeous, and that dewy kind of half-sweat, half-fog from the moors kind of thing, was just so incredible.” (No disagreement there.)  </p>



<p>Ahead, Refinery29 chats with Delevingne about her current makeup and skincare must-haves, beauty philosophy, and why sisterhood is more important than ever. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong>Her back-to-basics skincare routine </strong></h2>



<p>Delevingne has been a runway mainstay since the 2010s, and has been public about her own skin journey, ranging from <a href=""https://www.glamour.com/story/cara-delevingne-psoriasis-met-gala"">psoriasis flareups</a> to adult acne. These days, she says, less is much more — a sort of pendulum effect of years of a “really intense way of doing things,” earlier in her career, as she puts it, with elaborate, multi-step skincare routines: “Now, I just wash my face and use the <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/revitalift-15-pure-hyaluronic-acid-serum-pimprod2001763?sku=2534685"">[L’Oréal] Revitalift serum</a>, give myself a little lymphatic massage, and drain all that nonsense out my face.” Cut to us both on Zoom, demonstrating our favorite techniques; I’m partial to using my fingertips to glide from between the brows down to the cheekbones, and sweeping along jawline to relieve tension and temporarily depuff. </p>



<h2><strong>Her ultimate brow styling hack </strong></h2>



<p>It’s been a long time since I’ve been genuinely floored by a beauty hack, but Delevingne’s takes the cake, IMO. “For a long time — way before I even worked with L’Oréal — I would always use <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/elnett-extra-strong-unscented-hairspray-xlsImpprod4180679?sku=2241495"">Elnett</a> [hairspray] on my brows because it reminded me of my granny,” she tells me. “I’d just get a little mascara wand and put it on [the bristles].” (Editor’s note: I can confirm this indeed, works like a charm.) However, if you prefer to stick to <em>actual </em>gels Delevingne and I both swear by <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/infallible-up-24h-brow-lamination-pimprod2045478?sku=2625593"">L’Oréal’s Infallible Brow Lamination gel</a>. It’s especially great for naturally thick brows since it delivers all-day hold but doesn’t feel crunchy, nor does it leave visible, dandruff-like residue that shows up in darker brows like mine. And it seems Delevingne agrees: “I think if I laminated my brows, they would look crazy since I already trim them a lot, but I love the lamination gel.” </p>



<h2><strong>What “I’m Worth It” means to her </strong></h2>



<p>Delevingne is refreshingly candid about discussing her career, but absolutely lights up when speaking about the philanthropic work she gets to witness as part of <a href=""https://www.lorealparisusa.com/women-of-worth"">L’Oréal’s Women of Worth</a> — a mission-driven initiative inspired by the brand’s iconic tagline. “I think especially right now when gender equality and women’s rights are being taken away and stripped back so much, [it’s inspiring] to be able to bring something that isn’t fear and bad news,” she says of the program, which awards ten monetary grants of $25,000 to non-profits grounded in female empowerment. “I remember going to my first [Women of Worth] event back in 2024, and I can’t tell you how inspired and blown away I was by all of them,” she says. “And [when] people asked me, ‘Which one touched you the most?<em>”</em><em>’</em> I was like, ‘Which one didn’t?’” (Facts!) </p>



<h2><strong>Discovering beauty on her own terms </strong></h2>



<p>In typical Delevingne fashion, the model is having more fun than ever when it comes to beauty — and making it her own. “Growing up as a girl that didn’t love very feminine things like clothes and makeup, I didn’t have an appreciation for it when I was modeling in the same way that I do now,” she says. “When I had space to explore and figure out my own style, my own way of doing makeup, it’s like I’ve experienced what most girls go through as a teenager in my 20s and 30s — it’s that second coming of being a woman.” </p>



<h2><strong>Her role as a L’Oréal ambassador </strong></h2>



<p>Having walked countless runways around the world, Delevingne is right at home at a fashion show — but nothing compared to the experience of being in <a href=""https://www.lorealparisusa.com/loreal-paris-x-paris-fashion-week"">L’Oréal’s Le Défile</a>, which has taken place at Paris Fashion Week for two years in a row. “When I was doing fashion shows, I definitely felt nervous and alone, but in that lineup, you have other people lift you up and do the same for others,” she says. “I’m in the lineup next to Jane Fonda talking about the things that scare us most, about lessons that we’ve learned and how important female friendship is.” </p>



<h2><strong>How beauty plays a role when acting (and her love of liquid liner) </strong></h2>



<p>From <em>Paper Towns</em> to <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/09/10649938/only-murders-in-the-building-cast-cameos"">Only Murders In The Building</a></em> (in addition to several other projects currently in the works), Delevingne has been busy honing her craft as an actor and utilizing beauty in her process. “When you’re playing a character, I try to think of what scent that person would wear or what little makeup thing that they are really tied to,” she says. “For me as a person, I love doing a cat eye with liquid eyeliner, because I’m good at drawing. So being able to think about that for a character is always so fun, and I think it’s such a good tool to get into that [mindset].” </p>

<p><strong>Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?</strong><br />Yes — both my mom and dad have degrees. I remember my dad studying for his bachelor’s degree when I was a kid, so he could make more money for our family. They always told us we needed to go to college and would help as much as they could. I loved science in school, so after graduating high school, I enrolled in engineering. Everyone always gave me advice to make “practical choices”, so I chose the school that gave me the most scholarships even though it wasn’t exciting. It worked out because COVID happened half way through my college experience, so going to an expensive out-of-state school would have felt like a waste. My parents helped me by sending me money when I needed it, but I took on the bulk of the expenses. I also received some Pell grants after my dad passed away during my junior year of college. <br /><br /><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?</strong><br />They always stressed the importance of saving money and the difference between wants and needs. There was definitely some fighting behind closed doors and stressors, but they never let it affect my brother and me too much. I didn’t really learn anything about retirement savings or investing until I graduated college, which was a mix of teaching myself and advice from my mom. My mom was an educator at a private elementary school so she was criminally underpaid. My dad was the primary breadwinner for our family and would get stressed by finances, so my mom handled them.<br /><br /><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?</strong><br />I did some babysitting/dog sitting from age 13. But my first “on the books” job was when I was 16, working for minimum wage at the mall. It was mainly for buying myself “trendy clothes”, to do things with friends and gas money. <br /><br /><strong>Did you worry about money growing up?</strong><br />No, if they did, they hid it from us. There was one time my dad got laid off but it didn’t last long because they hired him back two weeks later. We were comfortably middle class and my brother and I never went without our needs being met. We didn’t get most of our wants unless it was Christmas or our birthday. We could afford luxuries like family vacations but they were always on the frugal side, like camping and road trips. <br /><br /><strong>Do you worry about money now?</strong><br />Yes and no. Yes, as in I used to be a lot more disciplined in savings/investing, but after I went through a messy breakup with a long-term boyfriend I have entered my chaotic spending era. I have been more conscious about my spending lately and have been ramping it down. No, as in I know I am very lucky to have a decently paying tech job in this job market, and I have a lot of time in the future to save and invest. These days, I’m trying to balance my ‘fun spending’ with saving for the future. They’ve had a lot of layoffs at my company but my position is pretty secure as my work is a high priority — but you never know what can happen. <br /><br /><strong>At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?</strong><br />At 24, when I got my first ‘big girl job’ and moved out of my mom’s house. I have my emergency fund that I contribute to every month that I would use if I lost my job. I know I could always move back in with my mom if necessary but I’d never ask her for money. In unfortunate events, she received a large sum of money when my dad passed from his life insurance policy. I’m so grateful she has that to rely on for retirement even though we would all rather have my dad here.<br /><br /><strong>Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.</strong><br />When I was 18, my parents gave me the used car my dad drove. When I got in an accident I used the insurance payout for a downpayment on my new car. My mom has told me she has $10k saved for me that she would give me to help pay for a wedding or buy a house, but I have done neither of those things yet.</p>

<h3><strong>Day One</strong>: Monday</h3>



<p>9:00 a.m. — My alarm goes off. I had a busy weekend so I’m very drained. I scroll in bed until 9:25 when I go to log in for my iteration planning meeting, and run a comb through my hair so I don’t look like a mess on camera.</p>



<p>9:50 a.m. — Meeting done. Go make my bed/start some laundry and let the cats out on their catio. I eat my cookie dough overnight oats that I prepped the night before and make some black vanilla tea.  </p>



<p>12 p.m. — My friends are texting me about the <em>Love Island Reunion</em> watch parties tonight. I send them some places that look good and we agree on one. I go wash my face/brush my teeth (I have gotten in the horrible habit of doing this at noon — don’t judge). The cats get their lunch of wet food and I put some bacon in the oven for sandwiches. The catio gets closed for the day because it is too hot to have it open past noon during the Texas summer. </p>



<p>1:05 p.m. — I make a turkey club sandwich and eat while continuing to work. I see a mandatory meeting at 10 p.m. that pops up and I audibly sigh. I never have meetings this late, but we are pushing something to prod that I have been assisting on that is not part of my usual work. Luckily, the place we decided on for the watch party is 10 minutes from me.</p>



<p>2:45 p.m. — I get a text from my mom about the total from a lamp making workshop we did this past weekend. I send her my half. <strong>$140</strong></p>



<p>4 p.m. — I finish up my work for the day and the preparations for the prod deployment tonight. I go to my apartment gym for a quick leg day.</p>



<p>5 p.m. — Done with the gym. Once home I make a protein smoothie and shower. I do my makeup and blow-dry my hair. Trying to fit with the <em>Love Island</em> theme, I wear a tropical print skirt and a tube top with my Doc Marten sandals. </p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — I get to the place with my friend S. We meet our other friend M. there. We order Happy Hour drinks and $7 quesadillas. I feel bad for the bartender because he’s the only one working and seems very unprepared to serve the hoards of women coming in. I leave a $5 tip. $<strong>19.04</strong></p>



<p>9:30 p.m. — Unfortunately, the reunion is two hours long so I have to dip out early. S. says she will get a ride from M. I feel kinda meh about the whole reunion and am burnt out of <em>Love Island</em> news. I will definitely still be tuning into some social media discourse later, though. </p>



<p>10 p.m. — I get on my work call, which goes very smoothly. It ends in 20 minutes, which I’m happy about. I get comfy on my couch and finish the last 30 minutes of the reunion and then scroll X/Reddit for too long to read discourse. </p>



<p>11:30 p.m. — I get up to go shower (I can not get into bed without showering right before) and do my nighttime routine. I read my book, <em>The Writing Retreat</em> by Julia Bartz. I just started and I’m getting very invested in it. I try to go to bed at midnight but my messed-up sleep schedule doesn’t let me fall asleep until 1:30 p.m.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $159.04</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3><strong>Day Two</strong>: Tuesday </h3>



<p>9 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I feel pretty well rested, despite the late bedtime. I log in to work and answer some emails. After my daily team standup, I go make some scrambled eggs and a yogurt bowl with raspberries and chocolate chips. I try a new brand of chocolate chips from Aldi and I’m not a fan. I guess it’s back to the seven dollar bags of Ghirardelli chips. </p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — My cats are staring at me like they are being starved, so take a break to feed them. I fold my clean clothes from yesterday and get my life in order.</p>



<p>1 p.m. — After being trapped in a Teams exchange for too long, I go make a turkey club. It’s not brutally hot, so the cats are happily snoozing in their catio. I envy them.</p>



<p>2 p.m. — I go to my apartment’s coworking area because I need a change of scenery. It’s pretty empty and quiet, so I hunker down to do some testing.</p>



<p>4:30 p.m. — I finish up and decide to call it a day. I go to the mall near me to hunt for a new swimsuit. I have been wearing the same two I already have, so I want something new for a few pool-related events I’m attending. I end up in Dillard’s and find several good options that are 65% off. I finally decide on a green floral print one and two tops from the clearance rack. $<strong>69.17</strong></p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — After walking around the mall, I end up back in Dillard’s shoe section. I find a super cute pair of chunky black fisherman sandals for $<strong>56.84</strong> in the clearance section. My emo heart can’t resist, so I get them.</p>



<p>6:10 p.m — Once home I eat some leftover baked black bean tacos with avocado and sour cream on the side. I do the brain-rotting combo of scrolling TikTok with the TV playing YouTube videos in the background. I do this until I have to leave for my pole classes. </p>



<p>8 p.m. — Arrive at the pole studio and greet a few friends. I’m doing a flexibility class and then a Russian exotic class. The studio I go to is a bit of a drive, so I justify it by doing back-to-back classes. </p>



<p>10:15 p.m. — Finish up the second class and have a convo with a friend about our relationship/life woes. I also find our Russian exotic teacher is probably going to move next year and am very sad. At least we get one more year!</p>



<p>11 p.m. — Home. I make a protein smoothie and some popcorn and watch an episode of <em>Dandandan</em> while snacking. I shower and do my night routine. I continue reading my book until I fall asleep.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $126.01</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3><strong>Day Three: Wednesday</strong></h3>



<p>9 a.m — My alarm goes off and I log into my workspace. I join our quarterly connections meeting with the whole department. I let it play in the background while I make some scrambled eggs and frozen waffles. I also make a green tea. </p>



<p>11:20 a.m. — I order a 48-pack of wet food off Chewy for my older cat. Unfortunately, she is bougie and only eats one specific type, unlike my younger cat, who will eat anything. They both get half wet food and half dry food from their automatic feeder. $<strong>68.17</strong></p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — We have a vendor meeting about one of our applications we manage. The meeting goes well, but we have an end-of-month deadline for this, which seems like it will be easy to finish by. </p>



<p>11:50 a.m. — My younger cat catches a cicada and brings it inside to try to eat. I rescue it from her and throw it back outside where it lives to see another day. She seems very disappointed that she didn’t get to enjoy her disgusting snack.</p>



<p>1 p.m. — I eat the last of my black bean tacos and have a Waterloo Cherry Limeade, too. I put on <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> for background noise while I eat/work. My friend shared her Peacock account with me on the condition that I watch <em>Vanderpump Rules</em>.</p>



<p>4:45 p.m. — Log off for the day. Get changed for my pole class and leave.</p>



<p style=""text-align: left;"">7 p.m. — I’m done with the first class, which was a cardio dance class. I always feel a little cringe during this class but it is fun. I have an hour and a half to kill before my second class, so I head over to my mom’s house — she lives five minutes away.</p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — Eat dinner with my mom and her boyfriend. He made a delicious Mediterranean salmon with a strawberry salad and it feels nice to have someone make me a meal. My mom and I take her dog on a walk.</p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — Back to the studio for my second class. On the way back, I stop to fill up my car. Everyone says not to pole after eating but I’m the opposite; I can’t pole on an empty stomach. <strong>$36.27</strong></p>



<p>10:30 p.m. — Get home and I’m super beat. I shower and make some herbal tea plus a Greek yogurt dessert bowl. I play on my Nintendo Switch for a bit before switching to my book. I get a little too invested and read for too long. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $104.44</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3><strong>Day Four</strong>: Thursday</h3>



<p>7:05 a.m. — I wake up to my younger cat having a huge fit. She beefs with any cat she sees outside and doesn’t understand they can’t get to her. I let her out of my bedroom and try to go back to sleep. </p>



<p>9 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I can’t tell if I actually fell asleep again or not. My shoulders feel like they’ve been hit by a bus; today is definitely a rest day. I get up and log on. I take some Advil along with my morning supplements. </p>



<p>9:30 a.m. — Join my daily team standup and send out a few Teams messages. We have to meet with the vendor again for an issue and luckily they responded with a meeting time for today. After the meeting, I grab my double chocolate overnight oats I prepped and add raspberries. </p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — Join the vendor call and they don’t know what to do either. Great lol. I jinxed myself saying this would be easy to finish.</p>



<p>1 p.m. — Eat a turkey club and get ready to leave for my doctor’s appointment.</p>



<p>2 p.m. — On the way to my doctor’s appointment, I need a pick-me-up, so I get a half-and-half tea with peach from Sonic.<strong> $3</strong></p>



<p>3:30 p.m. — Done with my doctor’s appointment and I have a small balancer leftover from last time. I pay it with my HSA card. $<strong>17.06</strong></p>



<p>4 p.m. — I get home and hop back online. Answer a few missed messages and leave comments on all my stories on the agility board. We switched to a weekly sprints template a month ago and I really like it, my work gets done faster and more efficiently. </p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — I’m feeling beat from the doctor/flu shot I got. I lay down and take a nap.</p>



<p>6:20 p.m. — It starts storming and I get texts from my friends that the floating sound bath at our apartment pool is cancelled. I am lowkey happy as I want to veg out tonight. I get a refund of $19.32 for my ticket. </p>



<p>7:40 p.m. — I heat up some pre-made chicken tikka masala for dinner and eat it with rice. I have a self-care/craft night complete with dying my roots (I refuse to pay $200 plus at the salon for hair dye), and grouting the lamp I made over the weekend. I also play on my Nintendo Switch a bit.</p>



<p>11 p.m. — Stretch and read my book. I pop a melatonin for some undisturbed sleep. I am asleep in 30 minutes.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $20.06</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3><strong>Day Five: Friday</strong></h3>



<p>8 a.m. — I wake up early for a vendor meeting just to see it got moved to 9 a.m. I go back to bed and scroll on my phone.</p>



<p>9 a.m. — Log in for the meeting. Nothing gets resolved and it turns out to be a waste of an hour. </p>



<p>10:20 a.m. — Make some scrambled eggs and two frozen waffles. I also have a kiwi and make a strawberry matcha.</p>



<p>10:40 a.m. — I’m pretty much done with my work this sprint, so I do some chores around the apartment and vacuum. </p>



<p>12 p.m. — I respond back and forth with the engineer I have been collaborating with. I try not to be annoyed as I put in a work order for this assignment a month ago, and he has waited for the last possible second to fulfill it. Typical. </p>



<p>1:25 p.m. — Eat a turkey club. Take two Advil as I have a waxing appointment in 30 minutes.</p>



<p>2:20 p.m. — Get a wax. This is my first time seeing my waxing lady at her private studio versus at the big box chain I met her at. She gives me a discount for being a loyal customer but I tip 20%. </p>



<p>2:30 p.m. — On the way home I return something to Ulta Beauty and Amazon. I get back $57.54 from my returns, which basically means my wax was free. </p>



<p>2:50 p.m — I stop by CVS for a new claw clip because I stepped on my old one and broke it. I have eight dollars in extra bucks, plus a $10 off $25 coupon, so I get a lipstick, lipliner, and claw clip all for $8.61. Thanks, TikTok couponing. </p>



<p>4 p.m. — I take a long walk.</p>



<p>6 p.m. — My friend with benefits, K., comes over. He found out a month into us seeing each other that he has to move back to his home country in a year’s time. We get along really well, so we just keep seeing each other and it doesn’t hurt that the sex is good. I refuse to call it a situationship because I hate that term lol. We go get Pho and he pays.</p>



<p>8 p.m. — On the way back from Pho, we stop at a grocery store because I want a sweet treat. One of his friends calls him and invites him out with his friend group and we decide to join. I get some ice cream, turkey bacon, and a kombucha. <strong>$15.20</strong></p>



<p>9:30 p.m — After fooling around, I change into something better and do some quick makeup. We head to his place because he’s also dressed very casually and wants to change. </p>



<p>11 p.m. — We get to the place. It’s kinda dead so we hop to another place that’s more lively, but we have to wait in line for a bit. Once we get inside K. buys our drinks. </p>



<p>1:30 a.m — We decide to leave and I’m very tipsy but K. is sober and drives me home. We fool around again. I air-fry some Korean corndogs for a post-drinking snack.</p>



<p>3 a.m. — He leaves, which is perfect. I hate sleeping next to a man and would rather have my bed to myself. I shower quickly and promptly pass out. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: </strong>$77.81</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3><strong>Day Six: Saturday</strong></h3>



<p>10:30 a.m. — Wake up. I want to go back to sleep but my brain won’t let me. Both cats are cuddling with me, so I enjoy the cuddles and scroll on my phone.</p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — Get up and make some banana pancakes and turkey bacon. A few friends and I were going to my apartment’s Labor Day pool party but it’s raining. So we decide we’ll go on Monday instead since we have the day off. </p>



<p>3 p.m. — After being lazy/playing video games for a while, I get ready to meet some other friends C. and F. at a board game store. I lowkey want to stay home but know if I lay around all day I will feel depressed. They are going to be playing their own games, but I have some life admin stuff I want to do, so I tag along. On the way there, I stop at the grocery store and get a snack box and an onigiri for lunch. <strong>$13.51</strong></p>



<p>4:45 p.m. — The tiredness finally hits me. I head home to chill.</p>



<p>7 p.m. — I eat my leftover chicken tikka masala and commence my rotting session.</p>



<p>9 p.m. — K. comes over again and we go see <em>Caught Stealing</em>. I get my ticket free with my AMC A-List subscription. K. buys us popcorn. I enjoy the movie a lot — I would recommend! </p>



<p>12 p.m. — Get home from the movie and say our goodbyes. I shower and go to sleep.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $13.51</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3><strong>Day Seven</strong>: Sunday</h3>



<p>10 a.m. — Wake up and scroll in bed. The cats cuddle with me for a bit.</p>



<p>11 a.m. — Heat up some frozen Kimbap. I also make a yogurt bowl with kiwi and honey. It’s still raining so I enjoy the chill morning.</p>



<p>1 p.m. — I go to Aldi. I get hash brown patties, sparkling water, various fruits, a cucumber, peeled garlic, cherry tomatoes, white cheddar, salami, hummus, Greek yogurt, eggs, English muffins, granola, rice, pasta, olives, and chickpeas. <strong>$52.68</strong></p>



<p>2 p.m. — I head out for the pole studio and drink my kombucha on the way. </p>



<p>5 p.m. — I finish up with both of my classes. The first one was another cardio dancing class, and second was level three pole. I eat a protein bar in between classes. The tricks we were learning were very shoulder heavy, so I already foresee the pain I will be in the next day. </p>



<p>6 p.m. — On the way home, I stop by Raising Cane’s. What’s the point of working out if you can’t indulge in some guilty pleasures? I get a three-finger combo with a Diet Coke. <strong>$10.38</strong></p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — After showering and doing some very dark makeup, I uber to a friend’s house to chill before going out to the alternative/goth club. <strong>$12.89</strong></p>



<p>9:15 p.m. — After hanging out for a bit, we head out. </p>



<p>1 a.m — I head out early because I’m tired of socializing and dancing. I ended up not buying any drinks. I get a ride home with a sober friend. Once home, I heat up some frozen pizza. I start feeling sad and call my ex (we are on speaking terms). We talk about life and I cry some.</p>



<p>3 a.m. — I pass out and look forward to sleeping in for the holiday. <br /><br /><strong>Daily Total: $75.95</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>

<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>“I need to fix my sleep schedule LOL. And stop being sad about my ex. Other than that, I don’t think I did too badly this week. The shopping I did is very out of the ordinary for me — I usually don’t impulse buy clothes.”</p>
