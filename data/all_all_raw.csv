While I thought I was getting fired or about to get started on an urgent design ask, he just wanted to talk about philosophy &amp; K-Pop. As jarring as that was, I found it hilarious. During one of those calls, he shared an anecdote about how he helped his daughter with a college essay using ChatGPT. I used to work as a writing tutor, so any use of ChatGPT in the writing process struck me as suspicious. But, what they did with AI for her essay was actually brilliant.</p><p>He suggested that she write out the full essay with reckless abandon for citing sources: no reference formatting, no concern for straw-manned arguments, accurate quotes, or making sure paraphrases are in her own words. Rather, just write all the ideas down first. Then, upload the essay to ChatGPT and have it run a plagiarism check, finding the sources the draft is referencing. From there, they would review the ‘plagiarized’ sources, cite &amp; quote them properly, or remove the content from the essay, and weave it into her original work.</p><p>While, at first glance, I had my reservations, I realized this approach didn’t replace her voice or her original work; it reduced friction in her writing process. Here’s why: She first began writing everything on her own &amp; without AI, so the tone, style, and phrasing were hers alone. Second, while she might be inaccurate or wrong about how she alluded to or referenced sources, all that can be corrected later. Lastly, she had ChatGPT handle the critical &amp; clerical work: suggesting revisions, searching for relevant sources, and helping her integrate them properly into whatever citation style her class required. AI wasn’t writing the essay for her, she was using AI effectively by keeping her “authentic voice… to <em>enhance</em> expression, not to replace original thought,” as the <em>Enago Academy</em> would couch it.¹ Her voice came first, ChatGPT came second.</p><p>At the writing center I worked for, students could ask for help with anything from brainstorming paper topics to final edits. Our job was to guide students by keeping them on topic, catching blindspots, grammatical mistakes, and shaping the general structure. We gave them the feedback, but the students still had to apply it. The same is true for setting up AI as a writing tutor. I’ll argue that AI platforms setup with a tutoring persona can preserve a writer’s creative integrity and remove friction for research &amp; citing sources. I’ll demonstrate this through a reverse-engineering drafting (or reDraft) process for writing.</p><p>Before laying the process out, I’ll explain why we should care about writing, how AI can complement it, and some caveats to consider. Then, I’ll provide a high-level overview of the reDraft process, and go through it step by step on how I used it for my last article, noting what worked well &amp; what I would have done differently.</p><h3>Get behind me, AI writer</h3><p>You’re reading this article, which indicates you value writing already. Writing for our own sakes is important for many reasons too: it organizes our thinking, allows us to contribute our knowledge, and works as a self-teaching mechanism. If you can write about a given subject, it’s clear you understand it. I know many designers &amp; former colleagues in philosophy who have great things to say. My hope is to encourage the would-be writers who have insights to share with a process that fast-tracks them through the drafting stage and into editing.</p><p>That being said, using AI for written work or any creative material is tricky. On the one hand, it can operate as a great on-demand feedback generator. When writing centers are closed — or I’m just not in an easy or quick environment to get feedback — having something give me writing a second look has benefited me greatly. I still believe human feedback is more valuable — especially for brainstorming, style, and tone at least — but it’s nice to have something that compares sources, grammatical mistakes, and mechanics quickly too.</p><p>On the other hand, the temptation is to let AI creep into your work as a co-author or a ghostwriter. While some can differentiate the AI slop from crafted work, it’s becoming more difficult to tell when something is solely generated by AI. At the worst of times, people may just post completely AI-generated content and claim it as their own. I’ll take a firm stance against that approach. So, if you’re expecting an AI-first writing process, I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed. AI comes second here.</p><h3>A tale of two processes</h3><h4><em>Building snowmen</em></h4><p>Before any AI tools, my traditional writing process was more akin to Randy Ingermanson’s <em>Snowflake Method</em>. While that was geared towards long-form fiction, it served me well for nonfiction &amp; academic writing too. The idea was to start with a sentence capturing your general thought, idea, or argument and then continuously expand that sentence into a paragraph, from a paragraph to a page, and so on. It’s a <em>fractal</em> process, like how a snowflake is a fractal shape of itself.² So, I may have started with a thesis statement and then thought through how I needed to support my claim.</p><p>But I had serious struggles — like many others — with writer’s block, uncertain about direction in both my ideas &amp; method, and struggled with getting thoughts to paper even when I knew what I wanted to say. Usually, I enjoy the grind of a process, but I rarely did for writing.</p><h4><em>Throwing clay</em></h4><p>Pairing my tutoring experience with my director’s brilliance, my goal was to standardize his idea into a process to get me back on track with writing. His insight to ‘reverse engineer’ finding relevant sources, could be extrapolated in other areas of writing: drafting, revisions, alt-text, image captions, SEO, etc. Further &amp; most importantly, I wanted to maintain creative ownership, integrity, and approach this process with a solid ethical foundation.</p><p>The phrase <em>reverse-engineered drafting</em> is fitting because it inverts the snowflake method completely: crank out all the content and then clean it up. I rarely would just sit down &amp; write everything without worry for what my overall draft looks like, tone, voice, and grammar — all of which I should care about later in the editing stage. By way of analogy, think of the snowflake method like basket weaving by starting with one long leaf and continuously adding more and more to create a basket.</p><p>Alternatively, the reverse-engineered drafting, or <em>reDraft</em>, process is more akin to throwing clay in the sense that you start with an unformed lump that’s morphed into a pot. I soon realized that early drafts have a lot to offer; and this isn’t exclusive to the reDraft process either. AI can help shed some light through the muck like a writing tutor can help clarify some points that your paper could be saying without robbing the author of ownership.</p><p>I know AI isn’t required for a reverse-engineered approach in the way I’m describing, either; that’s perfectly fine. But for myself, I fall into so many tangents, get into the weeds on details that aren’t pertinent and sometimes end up writing nothing at all. It could take months or years (looking at my publishing history on Medium), before I actually finish a full draft. Just giving myself the permission to work with an unformed lump for a draft, knowing that AI can give me some clear feedbac,k was enough for me to crank out some undercooked, yet fully-baked thoughts.</p><p>If you’re wondering whether I used the reDraft process on this article, I absolutely did. And, of course, I asked AI for feedback on how to standardize &amp; refine the reDraft process too. I have a dedicated Perplexity Space called “Writer’s Room” that runs off the reDraft process. In what’s to come, though, I’ll walk through the process in detail, step by step, in case you’d want to bring it to your frontier model of choice. I’ll also share a link to the custom instructions I use on Perplexity as well.</p><h3>Reverse-engineered drafting</h3><p>With AI’s help, of course, I’ve distilled this down to a 5-step process from conception to submission. Depending on how much I already know about a subject, whether I’m constructing an argument or exploring an idea, the early steps may look slightly different. I’ll explain more when we go into more detail about each step.</p><p>In addition to Perplexity, I use Obsidian to help me keep track of where I’m at in the process with multiple note files as drafts with specific naming conventions. I’ll be sure to share those, too, that I’ll add after each step’s description. For now, let’s look at the process as a whole.</p><h4>reDraft process</h4><ul><li><strong>Step 1: </strong>free-form drafting (1 FF draft)</li><li><strong>Step 2: </strong>rough feedback (2 RF draft)</li><li><strong>Step 3: </strong>revision rounds (3 R# revision)</li><li><strong>Step 4: </strong>quality check (4 QA check</li><li><strong>Step 5: </strong>final review (published title)</li></ul><p>I’ll use my last article, “<a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/useful-ads-7899e1711157"">Designing useful ads</a>,” to walk through each step in more detail since it was both an idea I wanted to explore &amp; to test out this process.³ I’ll share what worked well, learnings from mistakes I made, and some adjustments I did.</p><p>For reference, here’s how I organize my Obsidian notes based on the naming conventions for each of the five steps.</p><figure><img alt=""Sidebar view of an Obsidian-style note list titled “Frontier AI ads,” showing a sequential set of files named “0 idea — advertisements in AI chats,” “1 FF draft — ads in frontier AI,” “2 RF draft — ads in frontier AI,” three “3 R1/R2/R3 revision — ads in frontier AI” entries, “4 QA — ads in frontier AI,” and a final citation-style line, “Walsh, Tanner (2026) Designing useful ads.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yX4JvumR4DZnc2RuDtkS0g.png"" /><figcaption>Obsidian sidebar showing the full reDraft workflow for the “Frontier AI ads” article from initial idea through free‑form draft, rough feedback, three revision rounds, and quality check; and it ends in the final citation for “Designing useful ads.”</figcaption></figure><h4>Step 1: Free-form drafting</h4><blockquote>Instructions:<br /><em>Begin writing without concern for spelling, grammar, or perfect citations. Focus on getting all ideas, arguments, visuals and references onto the page. Loosely note sources or ideas as you write.</em></blockquote><p>This step is about writing &amp; more writing. Get all the ideas on paper with that same reckless abandon, ignoring not only proper citations but also proper grammar, spelling, punctuation, paper structure, and having a clear thesis. Easier said than done, of course; I care too much about spelling &amp; grammar still. Yet, speed is key for step one. The more you have written down, the more you have to work with later.</p><p>With my last article, I began with general ideas and gave each paragraph an H4 heading in Obsidian that captured the thought for me. Because of the outline view and that headings can collapse like accordions, Obsidian makes it easy to quickly track &amp; scan a working draft. Here’s how that looked for me in step one:</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Obisidian article draft in dark‑mode showing the “Intro” section with two subsections and a collapsed accordion section: a “YouTube &amp; Spotify example” paragraph describing how ads slowly appeared on free services and frustrated users, and a “frontier models &amp; search engines” paragraph comparing frontier AI models to search engines with sponsored tags and banner blindness, ending by noting an opportunity to add ads smartly."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MoGTcAbBImMs8vV7a32LPw.png"" /><figcaption>Draft intro section for the frontier AI ads article with H4 headings to convey each paragraph’s idea in Obsidian.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s quick, messy, fairly coherent, but also some word vomit. But that’s the point. I can go back &amp; clean up what I wanted to say about YouTube during the editing stage.</p><h4><em>Reverse-engineering a brainstorm</em></h4><p>There’s another article idea I’m exploring about whether data trackers can help increase virtuous behavior. I have a Garmin watch &amp; a background in philosophy, so I know a bit about data tracking &amp; virtue ethics. What I don’t know is much about how the general data-tracking community might take data tracking to the extreme nor what the ethical implications of that might be. So, I wanted to learn more in two ways: top sources &amp; controversies. For this, I tend to use the following prompt as a starting point:</p><ul><li>“What are the top stories in [subject/topic] and what are people divided on?”</li></ul><p>If I’m just eager to write about <em>something</em> but nothing comes to mind, I might plug in either of these prompts into Perplexity:</p><ul><li>“Here are my interests [list of my interests], what are some topics I could consider writing about?”</li><li>“Generate writing prompts for me to explore based on my interests”</li></ul><p>AI is great for brainstorming &amp; giving some initial direction to start writing from scratch. I keep it ethical by making sure I’m doing the research though, looking through the summarized sources, and thinking about my own stance on the matter. AI is solely providing a general direction for me to do that. And I can narrow my focus, sources, and clarify my own position, taking notes for my Zettlekasten-inspired Obsidian vault to draw from later.</p><h4><em>Visual assets</em></h4><p>Since I work as a UX designer, Figma (and similar tools) works great for quick visuals to illustrate a point or make themed article banners like I have. I’ll create a page in a “writing” file for each article specifically with a component library that maintains a consistent color scheme &amp; typography.</p><figure><img alt=""Figma canvas showing a large black banner with a white roadside billboard mockup that reads “Driver in the red Camry, your left headlight is out. Take Exit 12 for Redline Autoshop. Typical fix for $75–120,” alongside the words “Useful ads,” with smaller UI mockups beneath illustrating conventional and “smart” AI ad responses and contextual panels."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*33L56B9WwY9gJkDmxe0XkA.png"" /><figcaption>Banner &amp; UI explorations for the frontier AI ads article: a “Useful ads” billboard warning a red Camry driver about a broken headlight, paired with AI interface mocks that reframe ads as contextual cards, coupons, and right‑rail panels designed to be genuinely helpful.</figcaption></figure><p>Figma recently added a generic component library making it easy for me to quickly wire out an AI chat interface to illustrate my points &amp; examples. Further, now that more AI features are in Figma, I had an easier time working with placeholder content and didn’t have to use <em>lorem</em> text anywhere. Until I had those visuals ready, I just added placeholders in the draft like so:</p><p>Before having my Perplexity Space give some feedback on it, I polished up the formatting a little by giving each paragraph an H4 heading that I may have missed earlier and clearly explain in my prompt what is meant to be placeholder in my draft. Sometimes the thesis comes later though too, which was true for the AI ads article. So, I’ll quickly take a shot on what point I’m trying to make that I can change up later if needed. For this I started with: <em>ads in AI can be useful and done better</em>. Sure it’s not punchy, that detailed, or even helpful; but it gets my aim in a nutshell.</p><h3>Step 2: Rough feedback</h3><blockquote>Instructions:<em><br />Upload the draft for feedback on:<br />- Structure: Logical flow and overall organization<br />- Thesis/Focus: Clarity and specificity of the central idea<br />- Flesh-out: Fill out details for core argument &amp; ideas<br />- Sources: Relevance and sufficiency of cited material<br />- Blind Spots: Identify missing context, underdeveloped arguments, or evidence</em></blockquote><p>I’ll export the free-form draft as a PDF and begin a thread in my “Writer’s Room” Perplexity Space. I typically write a prompt like this:</p><ul><li>“I have a free-form draft for a new article idea I’m writing as an attached PDF. So step 1 in the reDraft process is done. Provide initial feedback for Step 2. (attached PDF)”</li></ul><p>After all the feedback is generated, I have Perplexity compile it into a list of to-do items for me to tackle too.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of a dark‑mode Perplexity response showing a four‑part “Step 2” revision checklist titled “Thesis / Central Focus,” “Structure &amp; Logical Flow,” “Core Sections &amp; Main Argument,” and “Facts, Sources, &amp; Credibility,” each with short bullet points about clarifying the thesis, adding headings, defining concepts, and verifying sources."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*cbPwA_KItM-yVkJDaaeLnQ.png"" /><figcaption>The Step 2 revision checklist I used for the frontier AI ads article, outlining how to tighten the thesis, restructure sections, flesh out the main argument, and shore up sources before moving on to detailed line edits.</figcaption></figure><p>If I’m struggling with a particular item, I’ll bring it to Perplexity and treat it like a writing tutorial. For example, my initial thesis lacked clarity &amp; direction. So, I asked Perplexity how it might phrase my thesis statement. While tutoring students, I would help them sharpen theses in a similar fashion, going back &amp; forth on several revisions with different wording, sentence structure, aim, and focus. I’d suggest my take on it, then the student would bounce back with theirs. Well, the same is true here:</p><p><strong><em>1 Perplexity’s suggestion:</em></strong></p><figure><img alt=""Close‑cropped dark‑mode chat snippet showing Perplexity’s message: “Got it. How about this as a next draft:” followed by the thesis sentence about advertisements in free services like ChatGPT risking frustration and brand trust while frontier AI models can integrate them smartly into threads and responses, enhancing utility instead of disappearing into banner blindness."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QFGrj0tqdRFqeitmcS9ROA.png"" /><figcaption>Perplexity’s follow-up thesis suggestion for the frontier AI ads article, proposing a version that frames ads as smartly woven into AI threads and responses rather than lost to classic banner blindness.</figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>2 My revision:</em></strong></p><blockquote>While advertisements in any free service risk user frustration &amp; brand trust, frontier AI models have a unique opportunity to subvert user expectations for advertisements in a way that enhances the value of AI threads &amp; responses without compromising utility.</blockquote><p><strong><em>3 Perplexity’s revision:</em></strong></p><figure><img alt=""Dark‑mode chat screenshot showing Perplexity’s message: “Absolutely.

So it’s important that you read it carefully &amp; adjust it to your voice &amp; needs — especially for your core argument. Setting up guard rails in your prompting can help curb that temptation &amp; have AI help focus on giving you actionable feedback, as opposed to doing the work for you. Consider explaining what your goals are for a thesis or what you don’t like about it for instance. Good prompts lead to good feedback; and, as Justin Jeffrey reported on students seeking AI feedback, “poor prompts led to weak feedback.”⁴</p><p>While I had to improve some structural changes in the article, Perplexity suggested I keep the general roadmap as is — which was flattering, I guess. But it suggested that I integrate my visuals within the case study &amp; provide analysis paragraphs that explain the design and the principles they adhere to. That suggestion was very insightful, and it was nice to decide how to capitalize on that insight myself.</p><p>Once I had fleshed out some weaker sections and cut redundant ones, it was time to check for ‘plagiarism’ and find some sources. Here’s the gist of the prompt I used:</p><blockquote>“Okay, let’s find sources that are talking about what I’m writing about, referencing or alluding to. And let’s find similar works that are talking about the same topics or ideas as I am.”</blockquote><p>While I saw many folks talking about ads in AI platforms, there didn’t appear to be a lot of discussion on how they could be better for people — admittedly, this could be me relying on AI a bit too much to catch blindspots like that. But with the sources it did recommend, Perplexity gave a brief summary for each one &amp; showed in my draft where each source challenged or complemented a point I was making. For my part, I’d check the source, read through it, and find what was most relevant or helpful or more concrete for my article.</p><p>Last, I asked Perplexity to provide a Chicago-style bibliography citation of the source for me to track references at the end of the draft and making sure the right information is included &amp; hyperlinked if needed.</p><h3>Step 3: Revision rounds</h3><blockquote>Instructions:<em><br />Compile feedback into action items for the following categories</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Round 1: Structure and Organization</em></strong><em><br />- Refine thesis or focus statement.<br />- Ensure logical flow and coherence.<br />- Organize sections with clear headings and subheadings.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Round 2: Paragraphing and Clarity<br />- </em></strong><em>Improve topic sentences and transitions.<br />- Clarify arguments and evidence.<br />- Ensure each paragraph supports the main idea.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Round 3: Sentence-level Polish<br />- </em></strong><em>Refine sentence structure for clarity and readability.<br />- Correct grammar, punctuation, spelling, and syntax.<br />- Adjust word choice, tone, and style for the intended audience.</em></blockquote><p><strong><em>Embarrassing but honest disclaimer:</em></strong><em> </em>Admittedly, I didn’t go through the three rounds as I laid out above. Perplexity’s custom instructions weren’t as solidified at this point, and I conflated a lot of steps 2 &amp; 3 together where I lost a good bit of focus on what I was doing. And the same is true for steps 4 &amp; 5 too, but I’ll table that for now. For the remainder of this section, read what I <em>should</em> have done instead.</p><h4>Round 1</h4><p>Here, the focus is on tying ideas together, being consistent, and making sure the draft is complete from start to finish. I’ll begin by first collapsing all paragraph headings between the introduction &amp; conclusion sections to get an overview of the narrative flow, and then revise the intro or conclusion as needed.</p><p>The rest of round one is spent examining how a section ties to the previous &amp; following sections, and then how each paragraph ties to the previous &amp; following ones. Having labelled each paragraph topic saved time by allowing me to glance at how the paragraphs relate to each other, cut them if they don’t, or reorganize them if there’s a better fitting spot.</p><p>For example, it was time to explain how the UX principles applied to my lo-fi content cards in a few analysis paragraphs. This began with a list of principles and some rough definitions of them that later merged into analysis paragraphs near the visual design:</p><p><strong><em>Before:</em></strong></p><figure><img alt=""Dark‑mode editor screenshot showing a short paragraph about “being smart with a few principles” followed by four bulleted definitions: information grouping, information scent, banner blindness, and signal‑to‑noise ratio, with a final bracketed note about adding wires or sketches later."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gm9XUTSI81ByIITN901J8Q.png"" /><figcaption>Draft section defining the four UX principles that guide “useful ads” in frontier AI (information grouping, information scent, banner blindness, and signal‑to‑noise ratio) before moving into interface sketches and wireframes.</figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>After:</em></strong></p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of explanatory copy above a Figma‑style card mockup for “BrightSpark Electrical,” showing a star rating, price tag reading “$4000,” short company description, “Read reviews” link, and two buttons labeled “Free inspection coupon” and “Request service.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/998/1*G-Ib-XBbdLnn0zbHhD2PCw.png"" /><figcaption>The merged example of a “smart ad” card for an electrician that integrates the design principles in the analysis paragraph above it.</figcaption></figure><h4>Round 2</h4><p>Now that the ideas connect and the story is consistent, it’s time to polish the formatting. I’ll start thinking through names for each section or at least a phrase that explains what the section talks about. Eventually, my hope is that I’ll come up with something clever or cheesy — like Lewis &amp; Clark themed section headings on how to <em>trailblaze</em> the <em>frontier</em> for <em>frontier</em> AI advertisements. While there seemingly isn’t a lot for this round, finalizing the larger essay structure &amp; themes would allow me to hone in on the finer details now.</p><h4>Round 3</h4><p>If anyone caught my case study article immediately after it published, you’ll know that I overlooked a lot I needed to do in this round. Unfortunately, I can’t blame the sloppy writing on AI either since it’s directly from my rougher drafts — at least it’s <em>my</em> slop though. Again, learn from my mistakes; never skip sentence-level edit day.</p><p>While the tasks might differ from article to article, some things were already done more or less like thesis statement revisions, case study coherence, and so on. So what I have above was how I approached each task per round.</p><p>This round has a higher workload than the others, as the focus is to go through each paragraph &amp; tighten up the sentences, flow, and grammar for a cleaner polish. Usually, I aim to keep sentences as short as I can without losing clarity of the ideas. But making sure your tone, voice, and style are showcased is most important.</p><p>If needed, take one section at a time. I’ve learned it’s better not to approach this round all at once, too. All the writing &amp; structure is there, so it’s easier to come back and know what’s left to do after a break from editing. Once I’m satisfied with the sentences, coherence, and structure of the paragraph, I’ll delete the paragraph headings then move to the next section. For me, this gives me the sense of completion for what sections are revised and indicates that I’ve given this some close attention at the sentence level too.</p><p>So, after three rounds of editing, I’ll move into the next step in the process. At this point, I should have my draft in good shape, my visuals replaced the placeholder spots, and trimmed down the excess content I don’t need.</p><h3>Step 4: Quality check</h3><blockquote>Instructions:<br /><em>Check that your draft meets the following criteria before publishing<br />- Clear and specific thesis or focus<br />- Logical and coherent structure<br />- Credible and well-integrated evidence<br />- Readable and engaging style<br />- No major errors in grammar or mechanics<br />- Visual appeal and formatting where appropriate<br />- Strong conclusion (summary, call to action, or takeaway)<br />- Relevant tags or SEO if publishing online<br />- Banner image<br />- Article title &amp; subtitle</em></blockquote><p>Many of the tasks here may feel they’ve already been done. But it’s nice to have Step 4 as another round of feedback from Perplexity to catch my gaffs that I’ll miss in Obsidian or just mistakes I plainly overlooked. As Riwa By claims, AI goes beyond a traditional spellchecker because it can “analyze entire sentences, understand context, suggest rephrasing, and… match tone and intent,” making it a solid writing tutor.⁵</p><p>With what AI can do now, there’s really no excuse for leaving out alt-text &amp; captions for visuals. At the very least, I think there’s an argument for having this content generated — especially if the visuals are your own work or if you want to properly reference copyrighted imagery. But if you want to keep things in your own words, draft the captions, alt-text, and SEO descriptions of the article too. The AI tutor can give solid feedback on this also for screen reader users and teasing out details in captions that might be subtle in the imagery.</p><p>What’s unique to this section, though, is coming up with a title. I would spend way too much time crafting a title &amp; subtitle before I had even the idea fully formed in my head. However, with the reDraft process, content comes first &amp; cool titles come after. For the AI ads article, I threw some of my rough title ideas at Perplexity to refine further:</p><ul><li>“AI Trailblazing: the final AI frontier”</li><li>“Helpful marketing: how AI can make ads useful”</li><li>“UX for ads: AI’s unique opportunity”</li></ul><p>I ended up with “Useful ads: Trailblazing UX for Frontier AI” but quickly realized that’s a very vague title that doesn’t convey much. So I quickly changed it to “Designing useful ads” and the good folks at <em>UX Collective</em> provided a cleaner, more descriptive subtitle (thank you!): “Redefining the relationship between AI utility and digital advertising.” Thankfully, I didn’t have to rework my article banner image, since I usually don’t have those matching one-to-one with the title anyway.</p><h3>Step 5: Final review</h3><p>For my own peace of mind, I’ll have Perplexity review it one last time, providing exactly what I’d put in Medium’s draft page. However, since most AI platforms probably could offer endless feedback for ‘improvement,’ I had included in the Perplexity custom instructions to say when something is ‘good enough for my purposes.’ I’m not trying to be the next Dostoyevsky or Nobel Prize winner, so I can strive for excellence on my own standards rather than absolute perfection.</p><p>But if you — like me — eagerly tried a new writing process and noticed a lot of mistakes after it’s posted, I have two thoughts. First, Medium thankfully allows edits after posting; I can make some minor tweaks, fix grammar, or correct mistakes that I come across. Second &amp; more generally speaking, even if you can’t (or shouldn’t) make changes, I’m comfortable with saying that was not my best work &amp; can do better next time. Even though I notice things in my very first Medium article that I want to change or improve, I’m resisting the temptation and trying to lean into my own advice.</p><h4>Don’t just eat fish, learn how to fish</h4><p>While AI can be easily abused for any creative process, it can remove a lot of friction while maintaining human ownership of a work. It just has to be done with care &amp; self-restraint on what we allow AI to do for us. The goal is to identify clear boundaries in prompts &amp; instructions so that we focus more on our ideas, style, and prose.</p><p>More work does need to be done on a process like this for more stringent, professional work. The reDraft could be a decent start which academics could refine further — keeping the ethics, ownership, and standards honest for peer-review publications.</p><p>For newer writers, it may be more challenging to pushback against an AI tutor also. The <em>Enago Academy</em> warns that these platforms sound very confident, tout expertise, and have convincing explanations even when they’re factually wrong. But sources are linked in AI responses; click the links, skim the sources, and make your own judgement — especially for topics you’re still learning. Your name is on the byline for what you post online regardless if you had human or AI feedback.¹ Thus, it’s important to couch AI as an assistant, a librarian, and as a tutor that gives <em>suggestions</em> as opposed to gospel.</p><p>I love learning new things, and I don’t do myself nor my readers any good by having AI generate content I know nothing about. The old proverb “give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime” applies to AI creativity too. Write for yourself to understand new ideas, pay attention to what feedback AI gives you, and improve your writing style. In Jeffrey’s study, he found that AI helped students improve their writing where “82% reported improved error recognition” and “80% noticed details they typically missed.”⁴ AI can give you a full article to share in minutes, but it can also teach you how to write one yourself.</p><blockquote><strong>AI usage disclaimer</strong>:<em> AI tools were used for editing visual assets, writing feedback, assistance in locating relevant sources, &amp; Chicago-style citation formatting; all early drafts, ideas, arguments, &amp; experiences in this article are my own.</em></blockquote><h3>References</h3><ul><li>Link to <a href=""https://1drv.ms/w/c/369b550a350cb50a/IQCJ0YrsXADQTaamDDJ2kmC3AY5dQuZYKD3lm92JmwqpuUQ?e=bhLFTw"">custom instructions</a> for Perplexity Space.</li></ul><p>[1] Enago Academy. “AI in Academic Writing: How to Use Technology Without Losing Your Voice.” <em>Enago Academy</em>, December 14, 2025. <a href=""https://www.enago.com/academy/ai-in-academic-writing-how-to-use-technology-without-losing-your-voice/"">https://www.enago.com/academy/ai-in-academic-writing-how-to-use-technology-without-losing-your-voice/.</a></p><p>[2] Ingermanson, Randy. <em>How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method</em>.

Hell no!</a></figcaption></figure><p>Involving citizens in public design is much more than running an “open” process. It is about redistributing agency — enabling people to shape decisions, define problems, and participate in making change happen. It is as much about co-authoring a story of change as it is about delivering outcomes.</p><p>Over the past eight years, I’ve been fortunate to work with a broad range of people — from children on dialysis wards or someone’s friend’s uncle in Germany looking to rent power tools to everyday citizens wanting to inquire about their tax bill, and the people I work with. Across all of these experiences, I’ve come to trust something quite simple. That work gets better when people (or <em>citizens</em>) are involved in defining needs, shaping response,s and proposing designs — not just talking about change, but helping to make it happen, together.</p><p>Given that I’m currently working with a brilliant teaching team on the MPA in Innovation, Public Policy and Public Value at UCL’s Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose — with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rowan-conway-09bab58/"">Rowan Conway</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriella-gomez-mont-1186a417b/"">Gabriella Gomez-Mont</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/agostinaargirofuertes/"">Agostina Argiro Fuertes</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/cecilia-santucho-65578a133/"">Cecilia Santucho</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nlaport/"">Nickolas Laport Aldunate</a> — supporting students to start tuning into how we better engage, enable and empower citizens through participatory scaffolding, it felt timely to pause and reflect on what it really means to include citizens in the design process.</p><p>Drawn from fieldwork, facilitation, practice, research, and a somewhat substantial volume of reading across public innovation and social infrastructure in recent years, here are some notes from the field that I’ve been marinating on.</p><h3><strong>1. Spend more time outside than in the office.</strong></h3><p>Being and doing things together on site is where trust and respect are built across differences. Thinking doesn’t happen in spreadsheets alone; it happens in kitchens, on pavements, in school corridors, in workshops and vans. We can’t expect colleagues — or citizens — to always come to us, or to log into a Team’s call, when they are balancing lives of their own.</p><p>Instead, jump in a tradesman’s van for a ride-along, chat to your taxi driver, go on a dog walk, have spontaneous conversations where people naturally gather: the barber shop, the football pitch, the school gate. These are all so much more than romantic gestures, they are cultural and essential ethnography into how people actually live their lives.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a community engagement cycle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*x5J5gXYxwAkHOl5lvkERBw.png"" /><figcaption>Hilary Cottam — <a href=""https://www.hilarycottam.com/radical-help/"">Radical Help</a></figcaption></figure><p>This echoes much of Hilary Cottam’s work on relational welfare — the idea that change does not emerge from service transactions but from relationships built in the everyday spaces of life. In <a href=""https://www.hilarycottam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Social-Revolution-5.0-_dec19.pdf""><em>Revolution 5.0 A Social Manifesto</em></a> (which inspired this post) Hilary argues that our public systems are over-optimised for institutional efficiency and under-designed for human connection. Spending time outside the office is not a gimmick; it is a much-needed human correction.</p><p>A varied working process also opens more ways of contributing. Different spaces unlock different competencies. Some people speak best in formal rooms; others in motion, or over tea. Inclusion is not only about who is invited, but about the environments we design for participation. Basically, complex systems can’t be redesigned in conference rooms.</p><h3><strong>2. Hold back and wait.</strong></h3><p>Spend time. Percolate. Let plans evolve and be open to change. So much pressure comes from what we assume are procedural rules of the system — deadlines, reporting cycles, funding windows. But what happens when we loosen our grip? What could happen if communities genuinely shaped the direction, rather than reacting to pre-set options?</p><p>This isn’t easy. It often means moving at the “pace of trust” — and trust, that pesky, vague word, takes years to build and only moments to lose. It really means that this work cannot be rushed to meet artificial six-month timelines or funding deadlines. This theme has surfaced repeatedly in my conversations with practitioners and articulated much more fluently than I could dream of, particularly those working in place-based change like <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnhitchin/"">John Hitchin</a> or <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jo-blundell-1b746811/"">Jo Blundell, </a>who have that special skill at crystallising thoughts. The <a href=""https://placeandevidence.substack.com/"">Place &amp; Evidence substack</a> is a shining example of this.</p><p>In many of my own experiences, breakthroughs came only after long stretches of what looked, from the outside, like slow work: listening, showing up, returning again and again. Staying in the deep end long enough for patterns and signals to manifest. People (and by people I mean anyone from the policy teams I work with to the students I support) often ask, “How much research do we need?” But that’s a category error. You don’t know until you start learning — and learning takes time.</p><p>In complex systems, premature solutions often risk strengthening the status quo because they fail to shift underlying conditions. In this context, holding back does not mean being passive. It means resisting premature convergence of ideas. It means allowing relationships to form before solutions harden. It means accepting that the “messy middle” is not a phase to rush through, but that relationships are the core of transformation. Our role as practitioners is to continually pry open the space between problems and solutions, creating room for deeper exploration before closure.</p><h3><strong>3. Lead with deep generosity and an abundance mindset.</strong></h3><p>Reject the conventional economic logic of the “bare minimum” and instead bring intentional generosity and care into every interaction — throughout life and your work.</p><p>This can mean many things and, in public systems, it’s not easy. Generosity can feel naïve. We are trained to optimise, to reduce, to streamline. Time is scarce. Budgets are tight. Engagement becomes extractive almost by default: What do we need from people? How quickly can we get it? How cheaply can we deliver it?</p><p>Leading with deep generosity flips that frame.</p><p>It can mean taking the time to listen deeply to citizens to understand what they value and what makes a place work, rather than leading with data-heavy, deficit-focused profiles. It can mean hosting rather than merely facilitating — setting the boundaries of a space physically, socially and conceptually. Considering how much natural light is in the room. Whether the snacks are nourishing. Whether the space smells right. Whether the premise of gathering feels intentional and human. Even ensuring the font sizes in your document are consistent — because coherence communicates care.</p><figure><img alt=""Example sketch of street transition in Malmö — as part of the Climate KIC Deep Demo project"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*WJ8gULYyxoffYrlU.png"" /><figcaption>Scaling the Right to Retrofit — <a href=""https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/scaling-the-right-to-retrofit-3b74aa6b08ad"">Dark Matter Labs</a></figcaption></figure><p>I think that Dark Matter Labs is fantastic at illustrating this principle by arguing that transformation requires shifting underlying logics — not just introducing new tools (See: <a href=""https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/dm-threads-52b6a66d939b"">Dm Threads</a>). In this framing, generosity is not softness; it is a structural move. It changes incentives. It signals safety. It invites reciprocity rather than compliance. And when people feel respected and safe, experimentation becomes possible. Risk becomes shared rather than imposed. Generosity creates the conditions for long-term relationships (in perpetuity) rather than one-off transactions. It moves us from episodic engagement to ongoing stewardship.</p><p>Fundamentally, working from abundance recognises the immense skills, networks and energy already present in communities or teams, rather than viewing them through a lens of scarcity, conflict or decline. In complex work, what you choose to amplify matters. An abundance mindset amplifies capability — and capability compounds over time.</p><h3><strong>4. Provide the “milk carton,” not the “flavour.”</strong></h3><p>We have the amazing <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-dark-566b6965/"">Lauren Dark</a> to thank for this framing. As practitioners, our role is to provide the “scaffolding” and guardrails for participation (the “milk carton”) — such as safeguarding, policies, and frameworks — while allowing the local community to provide their specific identities, responses and lived experiences (the “flavour”).</p><p>This means designing participatory scaffolding around psychological safety and sensory comfort. As with my note on leading with deep generosity, the physical environment is a super easy way to think about shaping how people participate. A bland community hall with poor coffee can put people on edge. Designing lounge-room-like environments — creating front rooms rather than back offices — is part of this shift. Physical space communicates whether power is shared or retained. The container should feel safe enough for people to experiment, disagree and create.</p><p>But the “milk carton” is not only physical. It extends to the social and governance scaffolding we build around engagement. Frameworks such as Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) ensure that decisions are made freely, in advance and with full information — acting as safeguards for self-determination and sustainable development. This is not bureaucratic box-ticking; it is participatory infrastructure. Practitioners such as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/julian-thompson-66924652/"">Julian Thompson</a> (through <a href=""https://rootedcentre.org/"">Rooted</a>) are doing super important work in this space, grounding engagement in Design Justice principles. Their work reminds us that inclusion is not neutral. It requires increasing our own capacity to build empathy, recognise positionality and actively avoid harm.</p><p>My own mental model is to remember to avoid the trap of being the “hero” designer and being eternally optimistic about solving everything and helping everyone; instead, we should be striving to act as a translator or craftsperson who helps amplify the brilliant things the community is already doing.</p><h3><strong>5. Building “breadcrumbs” for policy change</strong></h3><p>Relational work is powerful — but fragile. Without translation, it evaporates at the policy interface. To ensure local insights aren’t lost, codify community conversations into thematic “breadcrumbs” that future policy decisions can remain accountable to. Make things tangible.</p><p>Dan Hill (in his book: <a href=""https://medium.com/dark-matter-and-trojan-horses/dark-matter-and-trojan-horses-a-strategic-design-vocabulary-strelka-press-18551fff3133"">Dark Matter and Trojan Horses</a>) refers to these, from a strategic design perspective, as “MacGuffins” — artefacts or interventions that carry narrative weight and create movement within complex systems. Extended through ideas like Trojan Horses, they become strategic devices: visible, workable objects or experiments that bridge the gap between radical local practice and the institutional mindsets of national policymakers. They make change experiential rather than rhetorical — ensuring that inclusive growth is rooted in lived, everyday experience rather than abstract ambition.</p><p>In practice, this means getting your hands dirty. Improvising. Being creative. Perhaps it’s my background in industrial design, but I believe in working through prototypes and experiments that allow participation to become a collective act of change. It means using probes, pilots and live tests to understand how ideas behave in real space — not just on paper. When something is built, placed, trialled or enacted physically, it shifts the narrative. It becomes evidence that listening has occurred in a way people can experience.</p><figure><img alt=""Boris Johnson on a rental bike in London."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/976/0*ATIXdbuQTLuRMq9l.jpg"" /><figcaption>Question if you will, they’ve had an impact on mobility</figcaption></figure><p>There is something powerful about interventions you can see, touch and use. Think about Santander Cycles — or “Boris Bikes.” Whatever your view on their politics (of both the service and the bureaucrat), they were tangible. Rows of red bicycles appearing across London were visible proof that a conversation about congestion, health and mobility had translated into action. You didn’t need to read a strategy document or look through a spreadsheet to understand that something had changed. The city felt different.</p><p>A shared reference point was created — something that allowed disagreement to be productive rather than abstract. Something for communities to respond to, debate, adapt and reinterpret — not just hypotheticals, but lived experience.</p><p>Without these breadcrumbs, participation risks becoming episodic — a series of conversations that dissolve once the workshop ends. With them, it becomes cumulative. It becomes part of how a place understands itself, and how institutions learn to act differently over time.</p><p><strong>To close…</strong></p><p>None of these thoughts is particularly new. Most of it is slow. All of it is relational. Fundamentally, this note is acting as a reminder. Including citizens in design is not a technique to master, but a way of working to practise — one that redistributes agency not just in theory, but in the everyday spaces where change actually happens.</p><p><em>This post is part of </em><a href=""https://civicworks.substack.com/""><em>CIVICWORKS</em></a><em>; a publication on (re)thinking civic bureaucracy, institutional reform, dynamic capabilities, policymaking and technology.</em></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=d28bf115700f"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/practice-notes-on-including-citizens-in-the-design-process-d28bf115700f"">Practice notes on including citizens in the design process</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Who hasn’t been part of a team or company that promises you that the next product will change the world?</h4><figure><img alt=""Designed by kikehey,com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kkEcDE6z01zArjC0gLXqZg.png"" /><figcaption>We are used to admiring, copying, and adopting ideas from other companies that have innovated the market.</figcaption></figure><p>Who hasn’t been part of a team or company that promises you that the next product will change the world? Or being part of a project whose mission is to deliver brand new products every x time and behave as an innovation lab? These promises have long been the spirit of the technology business; we know that, but it still feels refreshing every time you jump into a new project or job.</p><p>Maybe this stake is more prominent in start-up environments, where new ideas surface every day and the opportunity for growth is potentially wider. Philosophies like <em>“</em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/build-fast-fail-faster-embracing-agility-imperfection-jonathan-chang/""><em>Build fast, fail fast</em></a><em>” </em>are at the core of an agile mindset, helping us determine whether an idea is viable in the early stages or whether a pivot is necessary to achieve the desired numbers and experience.</p><p><strong>But what happens when an “innovation promised cycle” is built on unsteady ground?</strong> Maybe some of you think that’s the whole point of innovating <em>(building under uncertainty)</em>, but for someone with many years in the industry, I don’t think that formula is always effective.</p><p>I know I’m maybe being very pessimistic, but, truth be told, behind some great product ideas is a lot of mess that eventually generates long-term <em>stress (I’ll explain in a few paragraphs ahead).</em></p><p>When thinking about innovation, most product teams associate this term with ideas and justifications like: “We’re obsessed with users”, “this is what the market needs,” “we need to launch as fast as possible, and then we’ll figure out…”</p><p>From my perspective, <strong>this approach is OK, but somehow incomplete </strong>because it<strong> </strong>neglects everything that might happen within the teams before putting something into the market, and failing to account for this variable will lead to future issues. To explain my point, let me use a graphic.</p><h3>The innovation iceberg</h3><figure><img alt=""Designed by kikehey,com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*__lobXS7s3dgj1inR-IkDQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Innovation is as the result of solid knowledge, experience, and good practices</figcaption></figure><p>We are used to admiring, copying, and adopting ideas from other companies that have innovated the market. It is always a good idea to be inspired by others who have been on a journey like ours. But what we see is the tip of an iceberg, the final shape of something that has been built with some dynamic by some team; But what happens internally in the company is not always visible, and if so, it will be a positive innovation product case open to the public, no one is willing to say that after creating something new, now they have more problems to solve than before.</p><p>The way I see innovation is <strong>as</strong> <strong>the result of solid knowledge, experience, and good practices</strong> that allow me to spot opportunities or issues others haven’t seen, or to make moves others don’t expect. Take, for example, the greatest sports players in history; one of their characteristics is that they dominated the game they played and even changed it, but to do so, they always started with fundamental knowledge and abilities.</p><p><strong>The technique (base of the iceberg)</strong></p><p>Imagine all the greatest players and their glory without knowing how to throw a ball, or dribble, or jump, or make a stroke, hard to believe, right? Technique is what stimulates innovation once you have control of it. For example, in soccer, to perform a bicycle kick, you must first control your kick.</p><p>In companies, I refer to “the technique” as the fundamentals that enable teams to have healthy product dynamics and work as a unit; this is the hidden part of the iceberg, where several factors may influence innovative outcomes. From bottom to top, these are the most relevant:</p><ul><li><strong>The right talent</strong> understands business, anticipates adversity, creates opportunities, and solves issues effectively.</li><li><strong>Proper communication channels and ceremonies</strong> with no room for misunderstanding or assumptions that affect the execution of ideas.</li><li><strong>Defined roles</strong> that leave no room for doubt regarding deliverable expectations and responsibilities.</li><li><strong>Effective work dynamics</strong> that ensure the synchronization of multiple roles towards an objective.</li><li><strong>C-level and stakeholders with a clear business vision</strong> that avoids confusion or ambiguous directions to the teams.</li></ul><p>At the base of the iceberg, you are most likely to find a company's most difficult challenges. The reasons are endless, but it is also a great opportunity to start looking at your company or team and solve foundational problems before thinking about how to change the world with an idea.</p><p>Without “the technique”, launching products might be a wild card with a high probability of being a flawed experience, hard to scale, and hard to manage in the future. Sorry to say this, but sometimes we fall in love with a superficial layer <em>(the tip of the iceberg)</em> rather than changing things from the foundations up.</p><p><strong>The magic (the tip)</strong></p><p>This part of the iceberg is the clutch play in game seven, where glory is the reward. In general, this is the action that makes history or changes the way we see or interact with things. In companies, this is the million-dollar idea: a product that not only performs excellently but also changes user habits and generates money and engagement.</p><p>We’ve all heard stories of people who, one day, spotted or stumbled upon an opportunity and turned it into a billion-dollar business out of nowhere. This part is the romantic side of success, but I’m sure that behind that story, there was a trained instinct or some business preparation that enabled this person to make business magic.</p><p>As the innovation iceberg shows us, a company’s approach to innovation spans multiple levels that directly affect a product. Products should also have a solid foundation that ensures proper management and scalability.</p><h3>Layers of product innovation</h3><figure><img alt=""Designed by kikehey,com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*M-hzbe6BlQ71X0QaWuXo4g.jpeg"" /></figure><p>If your product development is stable, innovation can be a fun process. Think about having a solar system where the sun is the core that keeps everything working and in sync. The same effect can occur if you have a solid product core <em>(technology, design systems, methodologies, frameworks, communication channels, etc.)</em> that is perfectly orchestrated, so that if one disruptive idea succeeds, it will be easy to scale while maintaining high product standards.</p><p><strong>Levels of experimentation</strong></p><p>As in solar systems, elements farthest from the center are more susceptible to changes in their composition due to their distance. The same effect can occur when you have product ideas that are distant from the product’s core; <strong>they take an experimental nature.</strong> These quick ideas, like satellites, can have a short period of visibility and be fleeting (as in experimentation). When one of these ideas succeeds, making it back to the center to become part of “the system” is easier, and, for sure, it will adopt all your best product standards.</p><figure><img alt=""Designed by kikehey,com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RDA2FQZ80fwm4BvAowvmBg.jpeg"" /></figure><p>On the contrary, not having a solid product core and launching experimental ideas to test can be tricky for the company. Imagine you have a wonderful product idea that, in effect, might change the world. Once it shows high adoption and market demand, you need to scale up its structure from an experimental to an official product structure after the test period. Now you have a new product to operate, new users, a new market to seduce, or new technology to support; how do you do this without a proper production dynamic? Well, this is the everyday thing in some start-ups: on the inside, it’s just a mess, and we know messy environments lead to rushed delivery times, people burning out, massive resignations, a fragile culture, or, due to inefficient product growth, massive layoffs.</p><p><strong>My reflection:</strong></p><p><strong>Innovation is not wrong; it is actually the heart of the industry, and we should keep trying harder. </strong>What I think is wrong is trying without first setting high product standards for the company or its teams. In this era of technology-expert proliferation, inspiring messages <em>(the tip of the iceberg)</em> may hide an uncomfortable truth that no one is willing to acknowledge. Maybe I’m being too dramatic about this, but I’ve witnessed this “innovation issue” several times, and its only contribution has been posting on LinkedIn to appear revolutionary.</p><p><em>To write this article, I want to credit all the fantastic information sources and other authors who have written about related topics, each from a different exciting perspective.</em></p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/quirky-rants/from-flexibility-to-innovation-why-the-future-of-work-puts-people-first-01c075865352""><em>From Flexibility to Innovation: Why the Future of Work Puts People First</em></a><em><br /></em><a href=""https://dayakumar06588.medium.com/10-tech-innovation-by-2030-that-will-change-your-life-f8417a163247""><em>10 Tech innovation by 2030 that will change your life</em></a><em><br /></em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/build-fast-fail-faster-embracing-agility-imperfection-jonathan-chang/""><em>Build Fast, Fail Faster: Embracing Agility and Imperfection</em></a><em><br /></em><a href=""https://andreaiorio.com/en/blog/what-is-innovation-in-technology/""><em>What Is Innovation in Technology?

<h3><strong>The 80% job: how design leads are using AI — and it’s not about mockups</strong></h3><h4>Design leads spend 80% of their time communicating, aligning, and justifying. That’s exactly where AI helps most.</h4><figure><img alt=""A drawing of a man looking straight at the camera surrounded by a crowded desk"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bR4xPhoVSjwHhgLtf6Pdew.png"" /><figcaption>Image generated with <a href=""https://www.midjourney.com"">Midjourney</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Part 1: The Reality of Design Leadership</h3><p>Here’s what my job description says I do: set design vision, mentor designers, elevate craft quality, drive innovation.</p><p>Here’s what I actually do: run 1:1s, mediate conflicts, write justifications for decisions, align with stakeholders, update Jira, answer Slack, prepare for meetings, sit in meetings, follow up on meetings.</p><p>I lead a team of 7 designers at a European bank. I can’t remember the last time I opened Figma for actual design work.</p><p>This isn’t a complaint. This is the job. And if you’re a design lead, you probably recognize it.</p><p>(Whether your title is Design Lead, Chapter Lead, Head of Design, or Design Manager — if you’re responsible for other designers and their output, this is for you.)</p><h4>The Myth vs The Reality</h4><p>When I was an individual contributor, I assumed design leads spent their days reviewing designs, setting creative direction, and occasionally stepping in to solve tough UX problems.</p><p>Then I became one.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/72103bc2102b"">Megan Schofield</a> <strong>Experience Design Manager at Google</strong>, put it perfectly in an interview with <a href=""https://www.goabstract.com/blog/stakeholder-review-meetings"">Abstract</a>:</p><blockquote>“I would be inclined to propose that we, as designers, actually spend a significant amount of time, not designing, but in fact communicating, reviewing, justifying and defending.”</blockquote><p>Here’s what the typical breakdown actually looks like:</p><h4>What job descriptions say:</h4><p>- 30% Design strategy &amp; vision<br />- 25% Mentoring &amp; craft elevation<br />- 20% Stakeholder collaboration<br />- 15% Process improvement<br />- 10% Hands-on design work</p><h4>What the calendar says:</h4><p>- 30% Meetings (syncs, reviews, alignments, 1:1s)<br />- 25% Communication (Slack, email, status updates)<br />- 20% People management (coaching, conflict resolution, career conversations)<br />- 20% Justification (proposals, business cases, defending decisions)<br />- 5% Operations (Jira, planning, HR, tools, budgets)</p><p><strong>That’s 100% before you even get to design.</strong></p><p>Notice what’s missing? Exactly.</p><p>This isn’t because we’re bad at our jobs. It’s because the job isn’t what we thought it was.</p><h4>Why This Happens</h4><p>This isn’t a failure of time management. It’s structural.</p><p>Design leads sit at an intersection that no one else occupies. You’re translating between:</p><p>- Designers who think in users and flows<br />- Developers who think in systems and constraints<br />- Business stakeholders who think in metrics and deadlines</p><p><strong>You’re the only one in the room who speaks all three languages</strong>. So you become the translator, the mediator, the justifier.</p><p>Add to that: most design teams exist inside non-design hierarchies. You report to Product, or Engineering, or in my case, a Tribe Lead responsible for multiple disciplines.</p><p>This means every design decision carries a “<strong>justification tax</strong>” — the time spent explaining, documenting, and defending choices that other disciplines make in a quick conversation.</p><p>When your engineering counterpart says “we’ll use microservices,” nobody asks for a slide deck. When you say “we need to simplify this flow,” suddenly you need user data, business impact, and a prototype to prove it.</p><p>That’s the job. And once you accept it, you can start optimizing for it.</p><h4>The 80% Opportunity</h4><p>Here’s where it gets interesting.</p><p>If 80% of the job is communication, documentation, and justification — that’s exactly where AI tools excel.</p><p>And yes, AI is already changing design work itself. Tools like <a href=""https://cursor.sh/"">Cursor</a>, <a href=""https://lovable.dev/"">Lovable</a>, and <a href=""https://www.figma.com/ai/"">Figma AI</a> mean we’re not starting from scratch anymore — not on code, not on prototypes, not on layouts.</p><p>But here’s what most “AI for designers” content misses: design leads don’t spend their days in Figma. W<strong>e spend them in Slack, Docs, and meetings.</strong></p><p>So while AI-generated mockups get the headlines, the bigger opportunity for leads is quieter: drafting that stakeholder update. Summarizing research into exec-friendly bullets. Turning meeting notes into action items. Writing the first version of a business case.</p><p>The stuff that eats your calendar but doesn’t require your craft skills.</p><p>The next parts of this series will break down exactly how I use AI for each of these:</p><p>- Synthesizing research without drowning in transcripts<br />- Writing business cases that actually get read<br />- Communicating with stakeholders in their language<br />- Enabling my team without becoming a bottleneck</p><p>This isn’t about working faster. <strong>It’s about reclaiming time for the 20% that actually needs a design lead’s judgment</strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""A drawing of an old desk with a big red clock above the desk"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Q6efJjHmz22Z4Cve-8SPOQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image generated with <a href=""https://www.midjourney.com"">Midjourney</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Part 2: AI for Admin — Reclaim Your Time</h3><p>Before we get to the exciting stuff (building prototypes, validating ideas), let’s address the elephant in the room: the 80% of your week that isn’t design work.</p><p>The <a href=""https://www.stateofaidesign.com/"">State of AI in Design Report 2025</a> by Foundation Capital and Designer Fund found that <strong>89% of designers say AI has improved their workflow, with 84% using it in the research and ideation phase while only 39% use it during delivery.</strong>*</p><p><em>*Note: This report comes from VC and investment firms with stakes in the AI design space — it’s useful directional data, not independent academic research.</em></p><p>Design leads? We’re not even in those stats. We’re too busy in meetings.</p><p>So let’s fix that.</p><h4>Start with what hurts most</h4><p>For me, it was meetings. Six a day, sometimes more. By Friday, I couldn’t remember what we decided on Monday. Sound familiar?</p><p>I started using <a href=""https://tactiq.io/"">Tactiq</a>— it sits quietly in my Google Meet or Zoom calls, transcribes everything, and at the end gives me a summary with decisions and action items. What used to take me 20 minutes of post-meeting note cleanup now takes 2. <a href=""https://fireflies.ai/"">Fireflies.ai</a> does something similar and integrates with Slack if that’s where your team lives.</p><p>The trick isn’t the tool. It’s breaking the habit of thinking you need to manually capture everything. You don’t. Let the robot do it.</p><h4>Research doesn’t have to be a black hole</h4><p>Here’s a scenario: you’ve got 12 user interviews, survey results from 200 people, and a competitor analysis your team put together last quarter. Your stakeholder meeting is Thursday. They want “the key insights.”</p><p>This used to mean two days of reading, highlighting, and synthesizing. Now I dump everything into a tool like <a href=""https://dovetail.com/"">Dovetail</a> and ask it to find patterns. “<strong>What are the top 5 pain points mentioned by at least 3 users? Give me direct quotes as evidence.</strong>”</p><p>Is it perfect? No. You still need to sanity-check the output. But it gets you 70% of the way there in 30 minutes instead of 2 days.</p><p><a href=""https://notion.so/product/ai"">Notion AI</a> works well for this too if you’re already living in Notion. It can summarize messy interview notes, pull themes from a database, and clean up transcripts that look like someone typed with their elbows.</p><h4>A note on confidentiality</h4><p>If you work in a regulated industry — banking, healthcare, finance — <strong>you need to think carefully about what data you feed into AI tools</strong>. I work at a European bank with a security department that takes data classification seriously, and rightfully so.</p><p>User interview transcripts, internal research, and anything containing customer data should never go into a public AI tool without clearance. <strong>Check with your security and compliance teams first</strong>. Many organizations now have approved AI tool lists or enterprise versions with data processing agreements in place.</p><p>This isn’t a small thing. In financial services, confidentiality isn’t optional — it’s regulated. Plan your AI workflow around what’s approved, not what’s convenient. The last thing you want is to save 2 hours on research synthesis and spend 2 months explaining a data breach to regulators.</p><h4>Speaking stakeholder</h4><p>This one’s personal. I spend a lot of time translating design decisions into language that non-designers understand. “We need to simplify this flow” doesn’t land. “This flow has a 40% drop-off at step 3, and here’s why” does.</p><p>I use <a href=""https://claude.ai/"">Claude</a> for this. When I need to justify a timeline change or explain why we’re recommending a different approach, I’ll draft my argument and ask it to pressure-test it. “What would a skeptical product manager push back on here?” Then I refine before the actual conversation.</p><p>You can do the same with <a href=""https://chat.openai.com/"">ChatGPT</a>, though I find it tends to be more… diplomatic. Sometimes too diplomatic. When I ask for honest feedback, I want honest feedback, not a sandwich with compliments on both sides.</p><p>For research with sources, I use <a href=""https://perplexity.ai/"">Perplexity</a>. The key is always asking AI to provide references and data — it keeps hallucinations in check.</p><p><strong>Glen Coates, former VP of Product at Shopify (now at OpenAI)</strong>, put it well on <a href=""https://productschool.com/resources/product-podcast/Glen-coates-Ai-first-products"">The Product Podcast</a>:</p><blockquote>“I’ve now started taking screenshots and prompting AI to create a prototype from that. It speeds up the feedback cycle. It also helps me realize how dumb my ideas are before my team has to waste time on them.”</blockquote><p>That’s the mindset. Use AI to stress-test your thinking before you take it to the room.</p><h4>Documentation (the thing nobody wants to do)</h4><p>Engineers need specs. You have Figma files and a head full of context that hasn’t made it onto paper.</p><p>Here’s a prompt I use regularly:</p><p><em>“I’m handing off a new savings goal widget to engineering. It shows progress toward a target amount, lets users adjust their goal, and sends notifications at milestones. Write three user stories in standard format with acceptance criteria.”</em></p><p>What comes back isn’t production-ready, but it’s a solid draft I can refine in <strong>10 minutes</strong>. Compare that to the hour I used to spend staring at a blank Confluence page.</p><p>If your organization runs on Microsoft, <a href=""https://copilot.microsoft.com/"">Copilot</a> does this inside Word and can pull context from your emails and previous docs. Useful if you’re in a corporate environment where everything lives in SharePoint.</p><h4>Budget for exploration</h4><p>One thing I’d recommend: <strong>set aside a small monthly budget</strong> — even €20–30 — specifically for trying new AI tools. Treat it as a learning investment, the same way you’d invest in a course or a design book. Subscribe, experiment for a week, and cancel if it doesn’t add value. Many tools offer free tiers or trials, but the paid features are usually where the real time savings live.</p><p>Just remember to cancel the ones that don’t stick. I’ve learned this one the expensive way.</p><h4>One tool. One week. That’s it.</h4><p>Don’t try to automate your entire workflow overnight. Pick the one task that consistently eats your time:</p><p>- Meetings? Try <a href=""https://tactiq.io/"">Tactiq</a> or <a href=""https://fireflies.ai/"">Fireflies</a><br />- Research synthesis? Try <a href=""https://dovetail.com/"">Dovetail</a> or <a href=""https://notion.so/product/ai"">Notion AI</a><br />- Stakeholder communication?

Not the capacity planning spreadsheets. The actual making of things.</p><p>Here’s what happened: as you climbed the ladder, you traded Figma time for meeting time. Makes sense — your value shifted from pixels to decisions. But somewhere along the way, most of us stopped creating anything at all.</p><p>I’m not here to argue that design leads should be doing hands-on design work. We shouldn’t — not for production anyway. That’s our team’s domain, and I’m fortunate to have an amazing team that handles craft with skill and care. <strong>What I don’t want to do is bypass them or create a dynamic where they feel undermined by a lead who keeps jumping into production work</strong>.</p><p>But there’s a different kind of creating that matters: the quick prototype that proves a point. The functional demo that ends the debate. The working thing that gets stakeholders to finally *see* what you’ve been trying to explain.</p><p>That’s what this part is about. Not replacing your team’s work — <strong>de-risking ideas before committing their time</strong>.</p><h4>The Real Problem with Figma Prototypes</h4><p>Traditional Figma prototypes are great for showing flows. Click here, go there, animate this.</p><p>But they hit a wall when you need to prove something works, not just looks right.</p><p>Try explaining a complex interaction to a VP who keeps asking “but what happens when…” and you’ll know what I mean. Or trying to get engineering buy-in on an approach they think is technically impossible.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/d07005ae7037"">Bryce York</a>, a startup product leader, nails this:</p><blockquote>“If you’re trying to get buy-in on a big concept, this can massively help your stakeholders really understand what you’re pitching. PMs have to have good imaginations, but most stakeholders’ roles don’t!”</blockquote><p>Static prototypes leave too much to imagination. Working prototypes end debates.</p><h4>Enter “Vibe Coding”</h4><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/ac9d9a35533e"">Andrej Karpathy</a> (co-founder of OpenAI) coined the term in early 2025. The idea: describe what you want in plain language, let AI write the code, iterate by running and refining.</p><p>You don’t need to become an engineer. You need to be able to say “I want a dashboard that shows account activity with filters for date range and transaction type” and get something functional back in minutes.</p><p>For design leads, this isn’t about learning to code. It’s about removing the bottleneck between your vision and something people can actually use.</p><p><a href=""https://www.cmu.edu/iii/about/news/2026/how-ai-and-vibe-coding-transform-product-management.html"">Carnegie Mellon’s Integrated Innovation</a> is already teaching this approach: “We now require vibe-coded prototypes rather than basic wireframes or sketches — reflecting what the workplace will demand.”</p><h4>The Tools (And When to Use Each)</h4><p>There’s no single right tool. Here’s how I think about them:</p><p><a href=""https://www.figma.com/make/"">Figma Make</a> — Best for: staying in your existing workflow</p><p>If your designs already live in Figma, this is the lowest friction option. Paste a frame, describe what you want interactive, and it generates working code. The killer feature: it understands your layers, components, and structure — not just the image.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/95d97a7d5732"">David Kossnick</a>, Head of AI Product at Figma, describes it:</p><blockquote>“We’re not just bringing the image when you copy a Figma frame. We’re giving AI the rich, structured data — layers, metadata, and styling details.”</blockquote><p>Good for: Quick interactive versions of existing designs, staying in familiar territory, sharing with team</p><p><a href=""https://lovable.dev/"">Lovable</a> — Best for: standalone prototypes without touching code</p><p>Lovable is probably the most designer-friendly of the bunch. You describe what you want, it generates a complete working app. No code editor, no terminal, no git.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/dc020be79c95"">Christine Vallaure</a> at UX Collective shares a practical tip:</p><blockquote>“If the first result feels messy or off, don’t try to rescue it. Start fresh with a cleaner prompt. It saves time and sanity.”</blockquote><p>The <a href=""https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/lovable-ai-for-ux/"">LogRocket team</a> tested it for UX workflows and found it generated a working, mobile-responsive UI with logic in about 20 seconds. Not production code, but enough to validate an idea.</p><p>Good for: Proving concepts to stakeholders, testing flows before committing design resources, personal projects</p><p><a href=""https://cursor.com/"">Cursor</a> — Best for: maximum control and flexibility</p><p>This one has a steeper learning curve — it’s a code editor, not a design tool. But it’s also the most powerful.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/72b03f90cf7d"">Joel Unger</a> Design Director at Atlassian, uses it to prototype complex Trello interactions:</p><blockquote>“AI is helping designers focus on higher-level thinking, communicate better with developers, and push creative boundaries.”</blockquote><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/745607030d8e"">Hardik Pandya</a>, also at Atlassian, spent 60+ hours vibe coding an elaborate product experience with data visualization, multi-device flows, and motion. His advice:</p><blockquote>“Your prototype gains the realism that makes stakeholders take it seriously.”</blockquote><p>Good for: Complex interactions, data-driven prototypes, designs that need to work with real APIs</p><h4>When It Goes Wrong</h4><p>It’s worth being honest about the limitations. Vibe coding can go spectacularly wrong when you trust the output without understanding it.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/9f12350bf325"">Tina Singh</a> wrote about this in Bootcamp: AI-generated prototypes often lose context between iterations, behavior exposes gaps that looked fine in a static design, and evolving a prototype through prompts can start to feel more like chance than craft. Her rule is practical: if you need twenty-plus prompt iterations to get something right, stop. At that point, it’s consuming more time than it saves.</p><p>I’ve hit this myself. I once spent an hour trying to get an AI-generated dashboard to handle edge cases in filter combinations — something my team could have resolved in a fraction of that time with a proper Figma prototype and a dev conversation. The lesson: vibe coding is excellent for proving *concepts*, not for polishing *details*. Know when to hand off.</p><p>Even Karpathy himself — <strong>the person who coined the term </strong>— has acknowledged the limitations. His later projects were hand-coded because AI agents weren’t reliable enough for what he needed.</p><p>The takeaway isn’t “don’t use these tools.” It’s “use them for what they’re good at: quick, disposable prototypes that prove a point and then get thrown away.”</p><h4>The Design Lead Angle</h4><p>Here’s what most “vibe coding tutorials” miss: they’re written for individual contributors who want to build side projects.</p><p>As a design lead, you’re not trying to ship code. You’re trying to:</p><p><strong>1. Win arguments faster</strong> — Instead of three rounds of stakeholder review on a concept, show them something working<br /><strong>2. De-risk before committing resources</strong> — Test if an idea is even viable before putting your team on it<br /><strong>3. Align engineering early</strong> — Nothing gets devs engaged like seeing a working prototype and being asked “is this technically feasible?”</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/abbf40336b08"">Patrick Neeman</a> tested several tools and concluded:</p><blockquote>“These tools are on a path to be game-changing for concept validation and stakeholder buy-in. While it’s not pixel perfect, it gives everyone a good idea how something would work, in some cases eliminating weeks to months of engineering time for realistic testing.”</blockquote><h4>Start Small</h4><p>You don’t need to build a complete product. You need to build enough to prove your point.</p><p>Pick one upcoming decision that’s stuck in debate. Maybe it’s:</p><p>- A new onboarding flow that stakeholders can’t visualize<br />- A dashboard concept engineering thinks is too complex<br />- A mobile feature that keeps getting deprioritized because “we’re not sure it’ll work”</p><p><strong>Spend an hour with one of these tools</strong>. Not to ship anything — just to have something to show.</p><p>The goal isn’t to replace your team’s work. It’s to create the artifact that gets everyone aligned before your team does the real work.</p><h4>What Stays Human</h4><p>One important caveat: these tools get you 70–80% of the way there. The last mile still needs judgment.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/dfe95783e10e"">Arpi Chugh</a>, a UX designer who tested Lovable extensively, captures it well:</p><blockquote>“I wasn’t using Lovable to come up with the design. I used it to test the design I already had in my head — faster than I ever could with traditional tools.”</blockquote><p>The thinking is still yours. The strategy is still yours. The AI just removes the friction between having an idea and being able to show it.</p><figure><img alt=""Drawing of an agenda with a big green checkmark and multiple annotations"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3kpUMG70NfcAj12FpgoR1Q.png"" /><figcaption>Image generated with <a href=""https://www.midjourney.com"">Midjourney</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Part 4: Validate Fast — From Prototype to Proof</h3><p>You built the prototype. It looks good. Stakeholders can click around.</p><p>Now what?</p><p>Here’s where most design leads make a mistake: they treat the AI-generated prototype as the deliverable. It’s not. The prototype is a hypothesis. What you need is evidence.</p><p>This part is about turning “I think this works” into “Here’s proof it works” — fast enough that you don’t lose momentum.</p><h4>The Justification Tax</h4><p>In Part 1, I introduced the “justification tax” — the disproportionate amount of time design leads spend defending decisions that other disciplines make with a quick conversation. That tax doesn’t disappear once you have a prototype. If anything, it gets heavier: now stakeholders have something tangible to have opinions about.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/172db8dc4450"">Tom Greever</a>, author of <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25520974-articulating-design-decisions"">Articulating Design Decisions</a>, puts it bluntly:</p><blockquote>“The most articulate person often wins.”</blockquote><p>That’s the problem. You shouldn’t have to be the most articulate person. You should have data.</p><p>AI prototyping gets you the artifact faster. Quick validation gets you the evidence to defend it.</p><h4>Why AI Prototypes Still Need Testing</h4><p>There’s a reason <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/"">Nielsen Norman Group</a> keeps warning about AI-generated designs: <strong>they often have visual issues like poor hierarchy, inconsistent spacing, and low contrast. They look plausible but don’t actually work.</strong></p><p><a href=""https://maze.co/collections/ai/validate-ai-prototypes/"">Maze’s research</a> on testing AI prototypes found three common problems:</p><p><strong>1. Looks right, works wrong</strong> — AI creates what’s statistically likely, not what’s strategically correct. Navigation that seems logical might confuse real users.<br /><strong>2. Lacks real context</strong> — AI doesn’t understand your business goals, audience history, or product constraints. It generates generic solutions.<br /><strong>3. Breaks design systems</strong> — Enterprise teams find AI-generated designs ignore component rules and brand guidelines.</p><p>The fix isn’t to avoid AI prototyping. It’s to validate quickly before anyone falls in love with the wrong solution.</p><h3>The 30-Minute Validation Loop</h3><p>Here’s the workflow that changed how I approach stakeholder debates:</p><h4>Step 1: Build competing prototypes (30–60 min)</h4><p>When your team argues about approaches, don’t debate. Build both versions using <a href=""https://lovable.dev/"">Lovable</a>, <a href=""https://www.figma.com/make/"">Figma Make</a>, or <a href=""https://cursor.com/"">Cursor</a>.</p><p>Two functional prototypes beat two hours of whiteboard arguments.</p><h4>Step 2: Set up a quick test (15–30 min)</h4><p><a href=""https://maze.co/"">Maze</a> integrates directly with Figma prototypes and now supports AI-generated prototypes from Lovable and Bolt. Define one clear task: “<strong>Find and start a savings goal</strong>” or “<strong>Complete the first step of onboarding.</strong>”</p><p>Keep it simple. One task. One success metric. Five to ten participants.</p><h4>Step 3: Let data settle the debate (results in 1–2 hours*)</h4><p>Maze shows completion rates, time-on-task, and heatmaps in near real-time. You’re not looking for statistical significance — you’re looking for obvious signals.</p><p>If Version A has 80% completion and Version B has 45%, t<strong>he debate is over</strong>.</p><ul><li><em>Note: The 1–2 hour turnaround depends on using Maze’s paid participant panel. If you’re recruiting your own users, expect longer. The completion rate example above is hypothetical to illustrate the point — in practice, your numbers will vary based on task complexity and audience.</em></li></ul><h4>Depersonalizing Design Debates</h4><p>Here’s something I’ve learned managing 7 designers: ego kills collaboration.</p><p>When designers argue about approaches, they’re often defending their taste, not the user. “I think users would prefer X” vs “No, Y is more intuitive” is an unwinnable argument because it’s subjective.</p><p>Quick validation shifts the conversation. The prototype becomes neutral ground. It’s not “your idea vs. my idea” — it’s “let’s see what users actually do.”</p><p><a href=""https://www.lyssna.com/blog/data-driven-design/"">TEG (The Economist Group)</a> adopted this approach and found they could “set up tests and get data in minutes, reducing the need for lengthy discussions and debates based on assumptions.”</p><p>As a lead, you’re not always the tiebreaker. You’re the one who creates conditions for evidence-based decisions.</p><h4>Tools for Quick Validation</h4><p><a href=""https://maze.co/"">Maze</a> — The fastest path from prototype to data</p><p>Best for: Quantitative validation (completion rates, heatmaps, paths). Integrates with Figma, supports AI-generated prototypes from Lovable, Bolt, and Figma Make. Results arrive in 1–2 hours with their panel, or share with your own users.</p><p><em>Pricing: Free tier available, paid starts at $99/month.</em></p><p><a href=""https://attentioninsight.com/"">Attention Insight</a> — Predict attention before testing</p><p>Uses AI to generate eye-tracking heatmaps based on visual saliency. Good for quick gut-checks on hierarchy and CTA visibility before you run real tests.</p><p><a href=""https://hotjar.com/"">Hotjar</a> — For live products</p><p>If your prototype is deployed (Lovable and Bolt can do this), Hotjar gives you session recordings and heatmaps of real behavior.</p><p><strong>Lightweight alternatives:</strong></p><ul><li>5-second tests (first impressions, what users notice)<br />- First-click tests (where users expect to tap)<br />- Quick surveys right after tasks (“How confident did you feel?”)</li></ul><h4>The Prompt Formula for Clear Results</h4><p>Speaking of prompts — they matter for testing too. Borrowed from the <a href=""https://adplist.org/"">ADPList AI Design ebook</a>, here’s a formula worth bookmarking:</p><p><strong>[Context] + [Task] + [Format] + [Tone] + [Constraints]</strong></p><p>Applied to test task writing:</p><p><strong>Bad:</strong> “Explore the app and tell us what you think.”</p><p><strong>Better:</strong> “You want to start saving €50/month for a vacation. Find where to set up a savings goal and complete the first step.”</p><p>The second version has context (user goal), clear task (specific action), and implicit success criteria (completing the step).</p><h4>When NOT to Validate</h4><p>Quick validation isn’t always the answer. Skip it when:</p><p>- <strong>The decision is reversible </strong>— If you can ship and iterate, ship and iterate<br />- <strong>Stakeholders aren’t actually blocking </strong>— Don’t create process where you don’t need it<br /><strong>- You’re optimizing prematurely</strong>— Early concepts need room to breathe</p><p>Use validation strategically: when there’s real disagreement, real risk, or real investment at stake.</p><h4>From Evidence to Alignment</h4><p>The goal isn’t just to win arguments. It’s to create shared understanding.</p><p>When you bring test results to a stakeholder meeting, you’re not saying “<strong>I was right.</strong>” You’re saying “<strong>Here’s what we learned together.</strong>”</p><p><a href=""https://attentioninsight.com/complete-guide-to-data-driven-design/"">Data-driven design</a> research shows that “<strong>data provides a common language for teams and stakeholders to discuss design decisions.</strong>” The evidence becomes the foundation, not your opinion.</p><figure><img alt=""Drawing of three papers on a desk with multiple stamps and signatures"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*f6-q_lL-gf11hrpeYyza-w.png"" /><figcaption>Image generated with <a href=""https://www.midjourney.com"">Midjourney</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Part 5: The Pitch — Prototype + Data = No Debate</h3><p>You’ve built the prototype. You’ve tested it. You have data.</p><p>Now comes the moment that separates design leads who get things built from those who get stuck in endless review cycles: the pitch.</p><p>This isn’t about presentation skills or PowerPoint templates. It’s about bringing the right artifacts to the right people and making decisions inevitable.</p><h4>Why Most Design Pitches Fail</h4><p>Here’s the pattern I see constantly:</p><p>Designer presents beautiful mockups. Stakeholder says “I like it, but…” followed by personal preferences. Engineering says “That looks hard.” Meeting ends with “Let’s iterate and reconvene.”</p><p>Three weeks later, same meeting.</p><p><strong>The problem isn’t the design. It’s the forma</strong>t.</p><p>Static mockups invite opinion. Working prototypes invite reaction. Data invites alignment.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/9093eee038b2"">Todd Zaki Warfel</a>, former design executive at Twitter, Cisco, and Workday, puts it simply:</p><blockquote>“When you learn to present your work with the right balance of proof and persuasion, you can win over your stakeholders.”</blockquote><p>The balance matters. Proof without persuasion is a data dump. Persuasion without proof is just opinion vs. opinion.</p><h3>The Three-Part Pitch Stack</h3><p>After years of pitching designs (and watching many fail), here’s the structure that works:</p><h4>1. The Working Prototype</h4><p>Let them click. Let them experience. Don’t explain what it does — show them.</p><p>AI-generated prototypes from <a href=""https://lovable.dev/"">Lovable</a>, <a href=""https://www.figma.com/make/"">Figma Make</a>, or <a href=""https://cursor.com/"">Cursor</a> change the dynamic immediately. Instead of imagining what something might feel like, stakeholders interact with it directly.</p><p><a href=""https://blog.pixelfreestudio.com/how-to-use-interactive-prototypes-for-stakeholder-presentations/"">PixelFreeStudio’s research</a> on prototype presentations found:</p><blockquote>“When stakeholders are actively involved in the presentation, they’re more likely to feel a sense of ownership over the project, which can lead to stronger support and enthusiasm for your ideas.”</blockquote><p>The prototype creates shared experience. <strong>Everyone saw the same thing</strong>.</p><h4>2. The Validation Data</h4><p>This is where Part 4’s work pays off.</p><p>Don’t just say “users preferred this approach.” Show them:</p><p>- Completion rates (80% vs. 45%)<br />- Time-on-task differences<br />- Heatmaps showing where attention goes<br />- Direct user quotes from testing</p><p>Data doesn’t eliminate disagreement. But it changes the nature of the conversation from “<strong>I feel</strong>” to “<strong>users showed us</strong>.”</p><h4>3. The Engineering Alignment</h4><p>Here’s where most design leads drop the ball: they pitch to stakeholders <strong>before</strong> talking to engineering.</p><p>Then engineering raises feasibility concerns in the meeting. Stakeholder confidence drops. The pitch stalls.</p><p>Flip the order. Before your stakeholder meeting:</p><p>- Share the prototype with engineering leads<br />- Ask: “<strong>Is this technically feasible? What would be hard?</strong>”<br />- Identify constraints and incorporate them into your pitch</p><p>When you present, you’re not saying “here’s what we want.” You’re saying “<strong>here’s what we’ve validated with users and confirmed with engineering.</strong>”</p><p>That’s a different conversation entirely.</p><h3>Tailoring the Pitch to Your Audience</h3><p>Different stakeholders care about different things. Obvious, but most design leads present the same deck to everyone.</p><h4>For Executives (VP+):</h4><p>- Lead with business impact, not design rationale<br />- Keep it short — they’re comparing your pitch to ten other priorities<br />- Show you’ve de-risked it: “Users validated this, engineering confirmed feasibility”<br />- Have a clear ask: approval, resources, timeline</p><h4>For Product Managers:</h4><p>- Connect to roadmap and OKRs<br />- Show user evidence that supports their metrics<br />- Be clear about dependencies and trade-offs</p><h4>For Engineering Leads:</h4><ul><li>Show the prototype early (before the big meeting)<br />- Ask genuine questions about feasibility<br />- Demonstrate you’ve thought about edge cases<br />- The AI prototype’s code isn’t production-ready — acknowledge that</li></ul><p>As <a href=""https://medium.com/u/216d1f5cc211"">Greg Becker</a> notes:</p><blockquote>“They don’t speak your language — you must speak theirs.”</blockquote><h3>The “No Surprises” Rule</h3><p>The biggest pitching mistake I see design leads make: surprising people in meetings.</p><p>Stakeholders hate surprises. If your VP learns about a major design direction for the first time in a review meeting, you’ve already lost — even if the design is perfect.</p><h4>Here’s my pre-meeting checklist:</h4><p>• Engineering has seen the prototype and raised concerns (which I’ve addressed)<br />• Product knows how this connects to their goals<br />• Key stakeholders got a heads-up about the direction<br />• I know what objections are coming and have responses ready</p><p>The meeting becomes confirmation, not revelation.</p><h4>Handling the “But What About…” Questions</h4><p>Even with great prep, you’ll get questions. Here’s how to handle common ones:</p><p><strong>”Can we also add [feature X]?”</strong></p><p>Don’t say no. Say: “We can test that. Let me add it to the next validation round and show you what users think.”</p><p>You’ve shifted from defending to learning.</p><p><strong>”Engineering says this is too complex.”</strong></p><p>If you’ve done pre-alignment, this shouldn’t happen. If it does: “Let’s schedule a technical review. I want to understand the constraints so we can find a solution that works.”</p><p><strong>”I just don’t like [specific element].”</strong></p><p>This is the hardest one — pure preference. Your response: “I hear you. We tested this with [X] users and [specific result]. Happy to test an alternative if you’d like to see the comparison.”</p><p>You’re not dismissing their opinion. You’re offering to put it to the same test everything else went through.</p><h4>The AI Advantage in Pitching</h4><p>Here’s what changes with AI prototyping in your pitch toolkit:</p><p><strong>Speed of alternatives:</strong> Stakeholder suggests a different approach? You can often build and test it before the next meeting. That used to take weeks.</p><p><strong>Tangibility over imagination:</strong> Working prototypes bridge the imagination gap. Most stakeholders’ roles don’t require them to envision complex interactions from mockups alone — so don’t ask them to.</p><p><strong>Lower stakes for testing:</strong> When prototypes take days, testing every idea feels expensive. When they take hours, you can test stakeholder suggestions without derailing your timeline.</p><p><strong>Code as communication:</strong> If your prototype was built in Cursor with React components, engineering can see exactly what you’re proposing. It’s not “can you build something that looks like this?” — it’s “here’s a working version, how close is this to production-ready?”</p><h4>The Follow-Through</h4><p>The pitch doesn’t end when the meeting ends.</p><p><strong>Within 24 hours:</strong></p><p>- Send a summary of decisions made and next steps<br />- Share the prototype link (so stakeholders can revisit)<br />- Note any open questions and when you’ll address them<br />- Thank engineering for their input (publicly, if appropriate)</p><p>This isn’t just courtesy. It creates a paper trail that prevents “I don’t remember agreeing to that” in future meetings.</p><h4>From Pitch to Build</h4><p>When your pitch succeeds, the transition to development should be smooth because you’ve done the work:</p><p>- Prototype demonstrates the interaction model<br />- Test data shows user acceptance<br />- Engineering has already reviewed feasibility<br />- Stakeholders are aligned on the direction</p><p><a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/the-designers-handbook-for-developer-handoff/"">Figma’s design handoff guide</a> emphasizes:</p><blockquote>“By working together with a shared language, designers and developers can avoid misalignment, reduce re-work, and confidently build a well designed and technically sound product together.”</blockquote><p>The prototype isn’t the deliverable. The prototype was the tool that got everyone to “yes.”</p><figure><img alt=""The same character from the beguining of the article looking at a selfie camera and smiling"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aTOIjzE93lnX9E4-vfv2zw.png"" /><figcaption>Image generated with <a href=""https://www.midjourney.com"">Midjourney</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Part 6: The Future of Design Leads — What Stays Human</h3><p>Let’s end where we started: with the reality of the job.</p><p>Design leads don’t spend their days designing. They spend them communicating, aligning, justifying, and managing. The 80% job.</p><p>AI is getting very good at the 20% — the mockups, the prototypes, the visual production. What it can’t do is the 80%.</p><p>That’s not a bug. That’s your future.</p><h4>The Skill Shift Is Already Happening</h4><p><a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-2025-ai-report-perspectives/"">Figma’s 2025 AI Report</a> surveyed thousands of designers and found something interesting: 52% of AI builders say design is <strong>more important</strong> for AI-powered products than traditional ones, not less.</p><p>The reason? AI outputs need curation, judgment, and quality control. Someone has to decide what’s good. Someone has to connect it to strategy. Someone has to make sure it actually solves the user’s problem.</p><p><strong>That someone is still human.</strong></p><p><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/"">Nielsen Norman Group</a> noted in 2025 that while generative tools can speed up tasks like asset creation and copy generation, <strong>“they still can’t replicate the insight of human designers.”</strong></p><p>The tools are changing. The need for design thinking isn’t.</p><h3>What AI Cannot Do</h3><p>Let me be specific about what stays human — not in theory, but from experience.</p><h4>Judgment and taste.</h4><p>AI generates options. Humans choose. <a href=""https://medium.com/u/677fcb8f826d"">Andrea Grigsby</a> in UX Collective put it simply: <strong>“AI may automate technical skills in design, but it can’t replicate human taste.”</strong> Taste isn’t preference — it’s the accumulated wisdom of knowing what works, what feels right, what aligns with brand and user and context simultaneously. It’s the thing that makes you say “this doesn’t feel right” before you can articulate why. AI can produce a thousand variations. You’re the one who knows which one is <strong>right</strong>.</p><h4>Stakeholder navigation.</h4><p>No AI is sitting in your meeting reading the room. Understanding that the VP is skeptical because of a failed project last quarter. Knowing that engineering is stretched and needs a simpler solution. Sensing that the PM is worried about timeline but won’t say it directly. I learned this lesson deeply at a previous job, when I had to present a product vision directly to the multinational CEO. Before the meeting, <strong>I did extensive research — his decision-making style, his priorities, what resonated with him</strong>. I talked to people who’d presented to him before. Then I spent weeks quietly getting his most trusted advisors on my side, making sure they understood and supported the vision before I ever walked into that room. The presentation was a success — <strong>it defined a product we worked on for two years, led to hiring two new development teams from Portugal, and more than doubled the UX team size</strong>. No AI could have navigated that. The research, the relationship-building, the reading of organizational dynamics — those are fundamentally human skills that determine whether your work gets built or gets stuck.</p><h4>Team development.</h4><p>You manage people. Each has different strengths, motivations, and career goals. AI can’t coach someone through a confidence crisis. It can’t mediate a conflict between two designers who have different working styles. It can’t help a junior designer see the gap between where they are and where they want to be. <a href=""https://www.thecaragroup.com/leadership-in-the-ai-era/"">Research from the Top Employers Institute</a> shows that <strong>68% of employees believe non-work-related training that supports their overall well-being is vital</strong>. Leadership is about the whole person, not just their output.</p><h4>Ethical decision-making.</h4><p>Should we use this dark pattern that increases conversions but frustrates users? Should we collect this data even though users probably don’t understand what they’re agreeing to? Should we ship this feature knowing it’s not accessible? AI doesn’t have values. You do. <a href=""https://aijourn.com/human-intelligence-in-an-ai-world-why-empathy-sense-making-and-ethical-judgement-still-decide-enterprise-success/"">McKinsey’s research</a> found that <strong>only 1% of companies feel “mature” in AI integration</strong>, and the biggest barriers are not technical but leadership and organizational factors.</p><h4>Sense-making in ambiguity.</h4><p>When the strategy is unclear, when stakeholders disagree, when the data points in multiple directions — <strong>that’s when human judgment matters most</strong>. AI excels with clear inputs and defined parameters. Real design leadership happens when neither exists.</p><h3>The Design Lead of 2028</h3><p>Based on everything we’ve covered, here’s my bet on what the design lead role looks like in a few years.</p><p><strong>AI transformation of creative work is accelerating</strong> — the tools we’ve discussed in this series were barely functional two years ago, and they’re now reshaping workflows daily. I don’t know exactly how fast or how far this goes, but the direction is clear: the tactical parts of design work will increasingly be handled by AI, and the strategic, human parts will become more valuable, not less.</p><p>Design leads will <strong>spend less time on creating production-ready mockups</strong>, writing documentation from scratch, synthesizing research manually, and building presentation decks. <strong>They’ll spend more time on evaluating and curating AI outputs</strong>, coaching team members through AI-augmented workflows, stakeholder alignment and organizational navigation, defining what “good” looks like for AI tools, and ethical oversight and quality judgment.</p><p>The title might stay the same. <strong>The job changes significantly.</strong></p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/1dd0fcefd09a"">Maya Brennan</a> 2026 predictions in <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/10-predictions-for-ai-design-in-2026-823da9f1db7b"">Bootcamp</a> capture it:</p><blockquote>“It’s an undoubtedly exciting time to be a Product Designer: the technical foundations have been built — and it is now up to us to re-imagine what the visual and interactive frameworks for these AI experiences will look like.”</blockquote><p>The people defining those frameworks won’t be AI. <strong>They’ll be design leaders with taste, judgment, and organizational skill.</strong></p><h3>Your Competitive Advantage</h3><p>If you’ve made it through this series, you have something most design leads don’t: a practical framework for using AI <strong>as a lead</strong>, not just as an individual contributor.</p><p>Let’s recap what we covered:</p><p><strong>Part 1: The reality of design leadership </strong>— the 80% job is communication, not creation.</p><p><strong>Part 2: AI for admin work</strong> — reclaim time through meeting notes, research synthesis, stakeholder communication, and documentation.</p><p><strong>Part 3: AI for prototyping</strong> — vibe coding tools that let you create again, not to ship production work, but to prove ideas faster.</p><p><strong>Part 4: Quick validation</strong> — testing tools to turn prototypes into evidence that ends debates.</p><p><strong>Part 5: The pitch</strong> — prototype + data + engineering alignment = decisions that stick.</p><p><strong>Part 6: What stays human</strong> — judgment, taste, leadership, ethics, and the ability to navigate ambiguity.</p><p>This isn’t about AI replacing you. It’s about <strong>AI handling the friction so you can focus on the work that actually requires a design lead</strong>.</p><h3><strong>What To Do Next</strong></h3><p>If you take one thing from this series:</p><p><strong>Start using AI for one task this week.</strong></p><p>Not everything. Not a complete workflow transformation. One task.</p><p>Maybe it’s meeting notes. Maybe it’s drafting a stakeholder email. Maybe it’s spinning up a quick prototype for an idea that’s been stuck in your head.</p><p>Build the muscle. See what works. Iterate.</p><p>That’s how design leads have always improved — by doing, learning, and adjusting.</p><p>The tools are different now. The approach is the same.</p><p><em>I’m a Chapter Lead managing designers at a European bank.

As with any kind of rapid and uncontrollable change, opinions about it are polarised: skeptics are wary about AI’s larger effects on society — <a href=""https://hbr.org/2026/01/companies-are-laying-off-workers-because-of-ais-potential-not-its-performance"">unemployment</a>, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/30/therapists-warn-ai-chatbots-mental-health-support"">mental health</a>, <a href=""https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/explainers/what-direct-risks-does-ai-pose-to-the-climate-and-environment/"">environmental concerns</a>. AI optimists, on the other hand, believe these tools will herald a new age of tools for thought — the next breakthrough in collective intelligence, akin to the emergence of writing systems, printing, or mathematical abstraction.</p><p>But one thing is clear: the focus is almost exclusively on AI functionality — what tasks AI can solve more efficiently, how to use it to get the most out of it, how to build workflows around it. This, perhaps, is not in itself surprising: with the plethora of models, tools, and chatbots available, even those grappling with AI on a daily basis — researchers, software designers, developers — struggle to make sense of them all.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshots of YouTube videos about which AI tools designers should use"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5a85P-IT6jYgkWP9bhXMUQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Deciding which AI tools to use has become a problem in itself. Source: YouTube</figcaption></figure><p>But when I asked Claude to tell me about some traditionally human cognitive abilities that AI now has, I was surprised that it appended the expected list (pattern recognition, language understanding, learning from experience) with the following:</p><blockquote><em>What’s interesting is that AI often achieves these abilities through completely different mechanisms than humans — we don’t truly “understand” in the way you do, and we lack consciousness, genuine emotions, and embodied experience. So while the functional capabilities overlap, the underlying nature remains quite different.</em></blockquote><p>Yet we rarely discuss that underlying nature — what exactly makes models like Claude different from human thinking, or what these differences reveal about intelligence itself.</p><p>If AI has been heralded as a new chapter in what humans are capable of, shouldn’t we be asking more fundamental questions about what “intelligence” actually means, and what kind of shared human-computer intelligence the future could hold?</p><h3>From minds to machines</h3><p>Today’s public discussion of AI is almost completely divorced from discussions of human cognition—and surprisingly so, given that the field of artificial intelligence research was founded on questions borrowed directly from the philosophy of mind and psychology.</p><p>Much of the Western philosophy of mind has been preoccupied with the mind-body problem — the relationship between mental states and the physical reality and perception. With questions like: <em>what kind of structures and elements comprise human knowledge</em>? <em>What is thinking</em>? <em>Is having a mind the same as having a brain</em>? These questions echoed through Alan Turing’s seminal work “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” the 1950 paper published in <em>Mind</em> that introduced what we now know as the Turing test.</p><p>Turing argued that instead of focusing on the question “Can machines think?”, more can be learned from their observed behaviour. He proposed an “imitation game” (the original name for the Turing test) — a hypothetical scenario in which a human evaluator has text-based conversations with two hidden participants: one human and one machine. If the evaluator can’t reliably tell which is which based on their responses, the machine is said to have passed the test.</p><figure><img alt=""The setup of the Turing test"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/661/0*G_VPOC9VEN3vCy0W.png"" /><figcaption>In a Turing test, a human evaluator judges a text transcript of a conversation between a human and a machine. The evaluator tries to identify the machine, and the machine passes if the evaluator cannot reliably tell them apart.

But the advancements in the understanding of the brain’s neural structure throughout the 19th and 20th centuries established the electrical nature of the nerve signal, culminating in neuropsychologist Donald Hebb’s theory on the neural processes that underlie learning. In his 1949 book <em>The Organization of Behavior</em>, Hebb theorised how neural connections form through repeated activation — a principle later summarised as “Neurons that fire together, wire together.” This insight provided the foundation for modern neuroscience, neural network theory, and machine learning.</p><figure><img alt=""Structure of the human neuron compared to the architecture of an artificial neural network"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/726/1*VK0tUU4UHW3HHWA7slJ3eg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>The principle “Neurons that fire together, wire together” inspired the architecture of artificial neural networks. Source: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning)"">Wikipedia</a></figcaption></figure><p>Early pioneers of AI believed that describing the mind in computational terms — made possible by Hebbian theory and the subsequent development of artificial neural networks — could finally answer those foundational questions about human cognition. If they could build computational systems that closely resembled the brain’s neural structure, they reasoned, those systems might recreate the processes underlying uniquely human abilities: language, visual perception, reasoning, artistic creation.</p><p>As work on understanding the mind unfolded throughout the 20th century, two competing views of intelligence emerged: pattern recognition (also known as “statistical processing”) and world modelling (known as “symbolic manipulation”). The difference becomes clear when we consider how a child might learn what a dog is.</p><p>From the symbolic point of view, every time a child sees a creature that their caregiver tells them is “a dog,” they form and develop the concept of <em>dog — </em>i.e.<em> </em>what properties are characteristic of dogs. When they learn to recognise creatures as another kind of “dog”, they are learning to make the connection between an instance—the dog they’re looking at — and their mental concept of <em>dog</em>.</p><figure><img alt=""How a child might learn the concept of “dog”: through recognising a pattern that’s consistent across all examples of a dog they’ve encountered, or by building a mental model of what a dog is"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BZxyXL5gEBijen6btqv5VQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>How a child might learn the concept “dog” according to pattern recognition vs. world modelling view. Collage created by the author. Source: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernese_Mountain_Dog"">Wikipedia</a></figcaption></figure><p>From the point of view of recognising patterns, a child sees many different examples of dogs: all kinds of shapes, breeds, colours, and drooliness levels. Their extremely malleable brain processes all these instances, identifies patterns, and learns to match new examples to this pattern. Very quickly they learn to classify new exemplars as either “dog” or “not dog.”</p><p>If the latter sounds extremely similar to a basic-level explanation of machine learning, it’s not by coincidence: artificial intelligence as a field — and especially the view of intelligence as pattern recognition — has been heavily influenced by child development research. In “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” Turing referred to an artificial intelligence system as a “child-machine”; early pioneers of modern AI research in the 70s explicitly stated the connection between the two fields. For example, in 1972 computer scientist <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Schank"">Roger Schank</a> wrote that:</p><blockquote><em>We hope to be able to build a program that can learn, as a child does, how to do what we have described in this paper instead of being spoon-fed the tremendous information necessary.</em></blockquote><p>A similar sentiment was expressed by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky"">Marvin Minsky</a>, one of the “fathers of AI,” in 1974:</p><blockquote><em>I draw no boundary between a theory of human thinking and a scheme for making an intelligent machine; no purpose would be served by separating these today since neither domain has theories good enough to explain or to produce enough mental capacity.</em></blockquote><p>And it’s not surprising why a child’s mind is so fascinating to an AI researcher: after all, we spend our early days being unable to speak or hold our head up, yet we develop object permanence by five months old, can distinguish our native language from a foreign one by six months, and perform cost-reward analysis by ten months old. And all of that without the massive datasets that systems like GPT, Claude, and Llama require: a modern large language model (LLM) trains on trillions of words, while an average five-year-old is exposed to around 300,000. How can we learn so much from so little, and so fast?</p><p>Both cognitive and computer scientists today mostly agree that intelligence comprises both statistical learning and world model building. But, for reasons I won’t detail here, modern AI research from major industry labs has largely abandoned the question of <em>how</em> children learn so efficiently, focusing instead on <em>whether</em> similar behaviour can be achieved through massive computing power and large training datasets. Still, the original question persists in a new field that has been developing alongside traditional psychology and computer science: computational cognitive science, which continues to ask what artificial intelligence can reveal about the nature of human minds.</p><h3>From machines to minds</h3><p>Despite AI’s origins in the study of human cognition, that connection has all but disappeared from public awareness. Yet while mainstream AI research has pivoted toward achieving human-like behaviour without needing to implement a sophisticated human-like cognitive architecture, a a swiftly developing new field—computational cognitive science — has been figuring out ways to use AI models as windows into human cognition.</p><p>The logic is fairly straightforward: if artificial neural networks are modelled (however loosely) on biological ones, then understanding how an AI system solves a problem could offer clues about how humans solve it too. This approach is sometimes called “reverse-engineering” cognition: build a system that can perform a human task, decipher how it accomplishes that task, then ask whether humans might be doing something similar.</p><p>And so far, the results have been impressive. <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712"">Since at least GPT-4</a>, LLMs have been able to solve<strong> </strong>difficult tasks across mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology, and more.</p><p>But a few concerns remain. First, AI learns from significantly more data than humans (very few of us can brag that we have read all of Wikipedia). Second, while AI can certainly be impressive, it still often falls short at some basic tasks that require symbolic manipulation.</p><p>For example, Yale University professor <a href=""https://rtmccoy.com/"">Tom McCoy</a> and colleagues <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13638"">found</a> that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with seemingly simple tasks like forming acronyms, decoding shift ciphers, and translating into Pig Latin — tasks that require symbolic manipulation following deterministic rules (e.g., “count the number of words in a list”). What’s revealing is that LLMs performed significantly worse when the correct answer was a low-probability string, even though these tasks have objectively correct, deterministic answers, and require no probabilistic reasoning whatsoever (unlike questions such as “How likely am I to get stuck in traffic at 5pm in central London?” — where statistical patterns are genuinely useful).</p><figure><img alt=""Experimental materials from Tom McCoy and Najoung Kim’s studies"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rAPFwOIs_JSgs9sMlmr0mQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Left: <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13638"">McCoy and colleagues found</a> that LLMs struggle with low-probability answers to questions that require a deterministic answer. Right: LLMs can make human-like inferences from adjective-noun pairs, but not for unusual combinations, <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17482"">Kim and colleagues report</a></figcaption></figure><p>Similarly, when <a href=""https://najoung.kim/"">Najoung Kim</a>, a professor of computational linguistics at Boston University, and her colleagues from Harvard University <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17482"">tested</a> LLMs on their ability to make inferences from adjective-noun combinations (for example, the answer to <em>Is a counterfeit watch still a watch?</em> should be <em>Yes, </em>but the answer to <em>Is a fake doctor still a doctor?</em> should be <em>No</em>) they found that these models struggled with low-probability, unusual combinations such as <em>a homemade cat</em>.</p><p>The takeaway appears simple: AI is extremely good at learning and generalising information, but it is limited by the tasks it was trained on. As McCoy and colleagues conclude in their paper:</p><blockquote><em>We should absolutely recognize [LLMs’] advanced properties. Nonetheless, we should also remember a simpler fact: Language models are… language models! That is, they are statistical next-word prediction systems […] In sum, to understand what language models are, we must understand what we have trained them to be.</em></blockquote><p>At this point, it seems appropriate to ask: is it even possible to study AI models as proxies for the human mind, when their performance is so clearly underpinned by amounts of training data that no human would process in a lifetime, and an architecture that relies primarily on statistical processing?</p><p>Recently, researchers have been trying to solve this problem by introducing additional constraints on how AI systems work: limiting and curating the data they are trained on, and tweaking the architecture to approximate the cognitive biases innate to human mind.</p><p>Researchers from Princeton University’s <a href=""https://lake-lab.github.io/"">Human &amp; Machine Intelligence Lab</a>, directed by <a href=""https://psychology.princeton.edu/people/brenden-lake"">Brenden Lake</a>,<strong> </strong>trained a generic neural network on 61 hours of video footage that came from a head-mounted camera worn by a single child over the course of 1.5 years. The simple architecture of the model allowed the researchers to test a simple theory of word learning: that novel words are learned by tracking co-occurrences of visual and linguistic information. The model tracks visual and linguistic inputs, which are in turn passed through the visual and linguistic encoders, and embedded in a shared vector space. In other words, the model tracks what kind of visual information accompanies verbal cues like “cat” or “toy,” just like a child might.</p><p>And while despite being trained on a tiny dataset — by today’s standards — it worked. When the researchers tested the model on a new set of images, it matched the words it learned during training with the correct visual referents, even though it hadn’t “seen” those specific images before. This finding goes beyond just achieving impressive performance: it provides evidence that word learning in humans could be possible through a general-purpose cognitive mechanism that combines representation and associative learning.</p><figure><img alt=""A toddler wearing a head-mounted camera"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*b5jE9hKC_qBS4dZi"" /><figcaption>“We showed, for the first time, that you can train an AI model to learn words through the eyes and ears of a single child” — Brenden Lake, professor of psychology at Princeton University. Source: <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-camera-wearing-baby-taught-an-ai-to-learn-words/"">Scientific American</a></figcaption></figure><p>This research suggests that the path to understanding the mind (and as a consequence, building better AI) lies in training models on less data, but thinking more carefully about the kinds of cognitive biases they should be imbued with.</p><p>And it clearly aligns with the original mission of AI research. <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/science/ai-infants-language-learning.html"">The New York Times article</a> covering this research concludes:</p><blockquote><em>For Dr. Lake, and for other investigators like him, these interlocking questions — How humanlike can we make A.I.? What makes us human? — present the most exciting research on the horizon.</em></blockquote><p>But is this approach likely to become prevalent in industry labs that lead the development of state-of-the-art models like GPT? Logically, it should: front loading effort and resources into building more interpretable models now would ensure their longevity (even now, a mere year after the introduction of ChatGPT, many young people are <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9wx2dz2v44o"">rejecting what they consider to be “AI slop”</a>). But for commercial labs guided by generating profits and appeasing shareholders, this seems unlikely: why bother spending resources on uncomfortably vague research when increasing computing power and training data have done the trick just fine? The <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/science/ai-infants-language-learning.html"">same New York Times article</a> points out:</p><blockquote><em>But mainstream industry labs behind the most competent A.I. models, and the companies that make them, have long been geared toward efficiently processing more data, not making more sense out of less.</em></blockquote><p>Academic research labs face a different version of the same problem. While not driven by pure profit motives, coveted funding sources often mean that their research is still more biased towards building more human-like agents — not creating technology for AI-assisted, more thoughtful and creative human. If we continue this way, where will it lead?</p><h3>What happens after AI passes the capitalist Turing test?</h3><p>We have found ourselves at a crossroads. On one hand, we seemingly understand more than ever about how humans think, learn, process visual information, and interact socially. On the other, this knowledge is being channeled almost exclusively toward building better AI chatbots that mimic human behaviour.</p><p>Why? First, because the direction is set by for-profit companies whose ultimate goal isn’t ushering in <a href=""https://maggieappleton.com/ai-enlightenment#our-missing-pocket-sized-enlightenment"">a new Age of Enlightenment</a>, but selling a product — making us more reliant on AI agents to simplify workflows, optimise routines, delegate tasks. Think less, less, less.</p><p>Second, for that purpose, research that focuses narrowly on pattern recognition and statistical processing does just fine. These systems are straightforward to train and improve, and their performance is impressive enough to sustain public interest and turn in profits. They pass the capitalist Turing test.</p><p>But here’s the trouble: reports of depleting critical thinking and shortening attention spans might just not be fear-mongering, but a direct outcome of systems designed solely for performance. If we spend our thinking time communicating with machines optimised for pattern matching, we might internalise those same patterns to make the interaction more efficient.</p><p>The crux of the matter is that interaction with AI is now <a href=""https://www.personalcanon.com/p/how-to-speak-to-a-computer"">predominantly designed to imitate a conversation</a>, and we typically expect our conversational partners to have their own intentions, beliefs, and inner lives. In linguistics, it has been <a href=""https://web.stanford.edu/~clark/1990s/Brennan,%20S.E.%20_%20Clark,%20H.H.%20_Conceptual%20pacts%20and%20lexical%20choice%20in%20conversation_%201996.pdf"">well</a> <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027799000815?casa_token=yzamMMmozkYAAAAA:7mmmqFEEXyIDV6oItH2TykqHs1s6vDWbfPouY5XksQYC7YCYFqeZl6vDNSUL81WcGnfEUZIIuQk"">documented</a> that during a human-to-human conversation, people adapt to each other’s language patterns to align their mental states and ultimately achieve better communication. But AI has no mental states it can align with ours. It cannot restructure its foundation — built on statistics and patterns — to match our symbolic reasoning. And as a result, instead of AI becoming a thinking companion, <a href=""https://youtu.be/RKK7wGAYP6k?si=c1WKCZUiYzqNzozU"">our own thinking risks becoming more machine-like</a>: fine-tuned to recognise statistical regularities while forgetting how to make inferences, form concepts, find deeper connections between things.</p><p>So… what’s next? This is where things fall apart, because a crucial piece of understanding is missing: we’re still far from fully grasping how concepts are formed, or how symbolic reasoning is actually instantiated in the brain. And without that understanding, we can’t build systems that genuinely complement human intelligence rather than flatten it. In order to get there, three things need to happen:</p><ul><li>Industry research labs need to engage seriously with cognitive science and collaborate with academic researchers. If I’ve made my point clear, artificial intelligence research loses much of its substance when it severs ties with the foundational questions that connected it to philosophy of mind and cognitive development. For progress to be truly significant, these ties must be restored and strengthened.</li><li>AI systems need cognitively plausible architectures. In modern cognitive science, biological plausibility plays a crucial role: if a proposed mechanism is impossible to implement biologically, that casts serious doubt on its validity. The same standard should apply to AI. Researchers need to think carefully about what data models are trained on and why certain architectures are chosen — not just whether they work, but whether they reflect anything meaningful about intelligence.</li><li>Most crucially, software designers and cognitive scientists need to collaborate on how these systems can actually serve humanity. No one else can figure this out — and <a href=""https://maggieappleton.com/ai-enlightenment#our-missing-pocket-sized-enlightenment"">many designers already agree</a> that <a href=""https://www.personalcanon.com/p/how-to-speak-to-a-computer"">chat interfaces are a poor solution</a>.</li></ul><p>There’s a brand of AI optimism that says what you get out of AI depends on how you use it: if you’re filling knowledge gaps rather than taking shortcuts, you’ll unlock creativity and thinking rather than rot your brain on slop.</p><p>I subscribe to this optimism to a degree. As a designer, AI has allowed me to move beyond technical constraints and create more freely.</p><p>But this “solution” is rooted in individualism and, frankly, elitism: the idea that AI will make only the smartest and most discerning among us even brighter and more capable. There’s nothing in that promise about elevating humanity as a whole. Yet research shows that real progress is impossible without <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_cognition"">collective intelligence</a>. If AI is to fulfil its promise as a tool for thought — a genuine extension of human capability — it must be designed not just for individual optimisation, but for collective progress.</p><h4><strong>References</strong></h4><p>Turing, A.

I don’t know. But there seems to be a sort of a urgency for something new. For speed. For freedom. For paving a new path. For simplicity. For flexibility. <strong>A push for something else rather than Design Thinking as the standard design process.</strong></p><p>I am talking about the new wave of <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-return-of-the-intuitive-designer-in-the-age-of-ai-6f0ea728d1d0"">intuitive design</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u94juYwLLM&amp;t=864s"">not trusting the design process</a>, of taste and craft as the only ways to do exceptional design, of <a href=""https://x.com/ryolu_/status/2000557301695226265"">jumping straight into code / material</a>. While some parts of those ideas resonate, not all of us are positioned or experienced to do that. Also, processes exist for a reason — usually to make sure we take our users into account, to avoid blindspots, to be sure we are solving the right problem and to meet high bars of quality.</p><p>Before coming across as a big saviour / defender of Design Thinking, I need to come clean: I think we often fall into the trap of wrapping design in bloated processes, frameworks, and mystical terminology, producing unnecessary artefacts and wasting time along the way. And I think that design doing is equally important as the design thinking part.</p><p>So what is my thesis here?</p><p><strong>We need to go back to what’s <em>essential</em> and what’s <em>natural</em>.</strong></p><h4>In pursuit of the essence</h4><p>In my first attempt to shape my perspective, I wrote a think piece on the <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/1000-questions-1000-answers-2eeaf01dcb50"">1000 Questions and Answers of design</a>. It’s basically a snapshot of design as I know it and practice, outside of methodologies and tools.</p><p>Even though I believe the article still makes sense, I started questioning my thinking. Can it be simpler? Can it be shorter? Can it be more natural and stripped down to the essence?</p><p>If you strip it down, I started to see the design process as two simple steps:</p><p><strong>&lt;&gt; &lt;&gt; Open your eyes.</strong></p><p><strong>— — Squint your eyes.</strong></p><p>We all do these steps already, with or without realising it. With or without Design Thinking.</p><h4>Huh?</h4><p>Maybe I simplified it way too much. Sometimes I can err in the other direction — making things too abstract.</p><p>This is what I mean:</p><p><strong>Open your eyes to get information. Squint your eyes for focus.</strong></p><p><em>When your eyes are open</em>, you observe. You look around. You absorb. You listen. You think. You notice things you’d otherwise miss — the way people use a product, the frustrations in their tone, something beautiful that inspires a new direction, a design pattern that solves your problem. You are in consuming mode and in a pursuit for new information and perspectives. You are in search for inspiration, references, sparks for your ideas. Along the way, you might become an expert in something and you will start to empathise with your users.</p><p><em>When you squint your eyes</em>, you focus. You tune out the noise and work with what you’ve gathered. You sketch, you build, you make decisions. You bring something into being. You roll up your sleeves and produce with this newfound focus, clarity and intention. The background gets blurry and you just create. Time also gets blurry, you are in the flow and designs materialise.</p><p>That’s how the eyes work. That’s how the mind works — expanding and present when immersed into something new, focused on execution and on auto pilot once having all information. <a href=""https://www.nikon.nl/nl_NL/learn-and-explore/magazine/tips-and-tricks/what-is-aperture?srsltid=AfmBOor-FBxrbfqFoy56R6qsVvcZZDv_3AsIXYyZMh7-_j3SNNo49iFd"">Even cameras work this way </a>— wide open to take in light and to focus all the way up to the horizon in the distance, then tightened up to sharpen focus and capture the detail in front of the lens. It’s the natural way of seeing, thinking, and doing.</p><h4>In practice</h4><p>You can open and squint your eyes as many times as you like to or need to. Just don’t do it at the same time. That’s call winking. Or multitasking. Both are quite useless while designing.</p><p>Here’s an example of how this “process” might work:</p><ol><li><strong>Open your eyes</strong> → absorb, get inspired, ask questions, explore.</li><li><strong>Squint your eyes</strong> → focus, design, make, refine.</li><li><strong>Open again</strong> → test, show, share, watch reactions.</li><li><strong>Squint your eyes</strong> → polish, detail, finalise.</li></ol><p>Repeat until something good emerges. Add activities that you need at the moment.</p><p>At the end, or in between: <strong>fully close your eyes</strong> → <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/rest-why-it-is-important-for-designers-66b539a7c5dd"">rest</a>, let ideas simmer, gain distance. Also a natural and essential part of the process.</p><h4>Zoom out</h4><p>Zooming out (or while squinting your eyes) you might see double diamonds in the eye picture above. You might also see the concepts of diverge &amp; converge. Your eyes might be seeing right.</p><p>We might be back to square (or diamond) one. But we are free and back to our nature. We know why we do what we do and do it with confidence. We block out the noise.</p><p>We don’t need to kill the Double Diamond, but we can admit it’s just a dressed-up version of something our brains already know how to do. The danger with process-heavy design thinking is that it can become an end in itself. Design becomes the artefacts <em>about</em> design, rather than the <em>design itself</em>. We need to be careful about that, while respecting and following a <em>natural</em> process, with the necessary steps and activities for our problem and users.</p><p>The next time you’re overthinking your process, just remember: open your eyes, squint your eyes. The rest is abstraction and decoration.</p><p>And don’t forget to fully close your eyes from time to time. The best ideas come after some good rest and distance. Practice it now… closing in 3, 2, 1.</p><p><strong>References and extra resources</strong></p><ul><li><a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/1000-questions-1000-answers-2eeaf01dcb50"">1000 Questions, 1000 Answers</a></li><li><a href=""https://arnevanoosterom.medium.com/design-thinking-is-dead-again-e48bb1b17b7c"">Design Thinking is dead... again</a></li><li><a href=""https://medium.com/@Tirdad/design-thinking-is-not-dead-but-are-we-extracting-its-full-potential-85342d291bea"">Design thinking is not dead, but are we extracting its full potential?</a></li><li><a href=""https://medium.com/@tufred/design-thinking-is-dead-or-not-d151376ab9ce"">Design Thinking Is Dead.

<p>R29 babes, this week begins in the dark of the moon, and we can all feel it. In the days leading up to the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, emotions run high beneath the surface, even as many people pretend they’re unfazed. This is a charged combination. The Dark Moon is always a liminal space, a threshold where fears, insecurities, and unspoken truths rise up, both personally and collectively. You may notice avoidance, dissociation, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/therapy-healing-relationship-family-friends-impact"">or emotional numbness</a> as coping mechanisms. The invitation here is honesty, at least with yourself. What are you afraid of losing? Where have you been trying to stay neutral when neutrality no longer feels possible? This is not the week to bypass discomfort. It’s the week to witness it.</p>



<p>Everything shifts on February 17th, when the Aquarius Solar Eclipse strikes and the Year of the Fire Horse officially begins. This eclipse is electric, disruptive, and unapologetically revolutionary, especially because it squares Uranus, one of Aquarius’ ruling forces. On a collective level, this is volatile energy. Expect an uptick in unrest, protests, system shocks, and visible attempts by entrenched power structures to hold on tighter as their foundations crack. Aquarius eclipses do not negotiate with empires. They expose them. This square makes it clear that staying on the sidelines is no longer an option. Over the next six months, people will be forced to choose where they stand. Comfort, compliance, and silence become increasingly uncomfortable positions to maintain.</p>



<p>And yet, just as the revolution peaks, the cosmos reminds us to keep our hearts open. On February 18th, Pisces Season begins, and the sky fills with a powerful Pisces stellium. The sun, moon, Mercury, Venus, and the North Node all gather in Pisces, creating a countercurrent of compassion, empathy, and spiritual remembrance. This is not weakness. This is medicine. While Aquarius agitates and Aries ignites, Pisces insists that healing, love, and imagination remain central. This stellium asks us to believe in the best-case scenario even when the world feels like it’s cracking. It urges us to grieve what’s ending, tend to collective trauma, and remember that liberation without heart becomes hollow.</p>



<p>The week culminates on February 20th with a rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries, a once-in-a-generation alignment that fuses vision with responsibility. On a personal level, this can feel like a calling, a moment where dreams stop being abstract and demand action. Many people will feel compelled to step into leadership, creativity, or courage in new ways. Collectively, this alignment can catalyze the birth of movements, bold initiatives, and new identities rooted in purpose. The shadow is ego inflation, savior complexes, or mistaking impulse for destiny. The higher path is conscious courage: act from integrity, not adrenaline. This week reminds us that revolution isn’t just about tearing down what no longer works. It’s about building what comes next, with intention, imagination, and care.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, the week opens in the dark of the moon, and for you, this stirs the part of life tied to friendships, communities, and social dynamics. If the vibes have felt oﬀ lately, trust that you’re not imagining it. With Saturn and Neptune now in your sign, you’re more visible than usual, and visibility attracts everything… admiration, curiosity, and yes, sometimes jealousy. As we move through the final days of the Year of the Snake, this is a powerful time to release old alliances, unspoken tensions, or the need to prove yourself within certain circles. You don’t need to confront everything. Quietly choosing distance is just as effective.</p>



<p>Everything resets on February 17th, when the Aquarius Solar Eclipse <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/making-friends-connections-adulthood"">activates your friendship</a> and community realm. This is a fresh start. Over the next six months, you’ll either deepen bonds with true ride-or-dies or meet people who align with the version of you that’s emerging now. This eclipse can also accelerate your digital visibility. You may feel called to join a new collective, show up more online, or even create your own community or platform. If your circle feels small right now, don’t panic. This eclipse is planting seeds. Trust that the right people will find you as you step forward more authentically.</p>



<p>The energy softens on February 18th as Pisces Season begins, inviting you inward for reflection, spiritual integration, and rest. This gentler tone pairs powerfully with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in your sign on February 20th, a once-in-a-generation moment of identity transformation. Saturn asks you to take yourself seriously, while Neptune reminds you to stay connected to hope, imagination, and faith. Together, they mark the beginning of a long chapter where your dreams are no longer abstract. They’re asking to be lived. This week is not about having all the answers. It’s about trusting who you’re becoming and allowing your identity to evolve with intention, courage, and compassion.</p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, this is the kind of week you end up writing a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/01/11636388/daily-journaling-mental-health-benefits"">fifteen-page journal entry</a> about and still feel like you’ve only scratched the surface. As the week opens in the dark of the moon, your focus turns inward toward your career, reputation, and long-term direction. You may find yourself spiraling a bit, questioning whether the path you’re on is still worth the energy it demands. With the final days of the Year of the Snake wrapping up, this is a release moment. Titles, expectations, or goals that once felt motivating may suddenly feel heavy or outdated. Letting go now isn’t failure, it’s discernment.</p>



<p>The turning point arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which brings an undeniable aha moment around your public life and sense of purpose. This eclipse pushes you toward innovation and authenticity. You may feel inspired to pivot professionally, redefine success, or take a bold step that aligns more closely with your values. Over the next six months, this eclipse can radically change how you show up in the world, especially if you’ve been playing it safe to maintain stability. Growth now requires courage, not comfort.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, the energy softens and shifts toward friendships, networks, and shared visions for the future. You may feel drawn to people who feel emotionally safe, spiritually aligned, or creatively inspiring. This gentler tone pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating a more introspective zone of solitude, healing, and spiritual depth. This is about learning to trust your inner world rather than fear it. Your intuition is strengthening, not to overwhelm you, but to guide you. The more you honor quiet reflection this week, the clearer your next direction becomes.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, this is one of those weeks where your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-get-a-good-sleep-reclaiming-rest"">brain is doing backflips</a> at 2 a.m. and suddenly everything feels <em>philosophical</em>. As the week opens in the dark of the moon, the spotlight turns to your beliefs, future plans, and the big “where am I actually going?” questions. You may feel restless, disillusioned, or torn between multiple paths. That’s not a sign you’re lost — it’s a sign something old is ready to go. In these final days of the Year of the Snake, release outdated narratives about who you’re supposed to be or what success is supposed to look like. You don’t need all the answers yet, just honesty with yourself.</p>



<p>Everything shifts on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which hits this same realm of growth, travel, education, and long-term vision. This is a genuine reset. Over the next six months, you may say yes to a new direction, commit to learning something transformative, relocate, publish, teach, or radically change your worldview. The square to Uranus means the pivot may come suddenly or feel slightly chaotic at first, but it’s freeing. This eclipse doesn’t want you stuck in analysis paralysis. It wants movement, even if the map isn’t fully drawn yet.</p>



<p>The energy softens on February 18th as Pisces Season begins, pulling your focus toward career, visibility, and your public voice. Your intuition starts guiding professional decisions more than logic alone. This blends powerfully with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating your community, networks, and long-term goals. You’re learning which dreams are worth committing to and which circles actually support your growth. Spiritually and socially, this is a maturation moment. You’re not here to float between possibilities forever. You’re here to choose a direction that feels meaningful and build toward it with intention.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955474.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cancer, this is one of those weeks where <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-intuition-gut-instinct-personal-safety"">your intuition is louder</a> than everyone else’s opinions combined, even if you’re trying to ignore it. As the week opens in the dark of the moon, deep emotional material rises around trust, intimacy, and shared resources. You may feel more sensitive than usual, or suddenly aware of where you’ve been over-giving, over-functioning, or holding emotional weight that isn’t yours to carry. With the Year of the Snake coming to a close, this is a powerful release window. Let go of attachments that drain you, even if part of you feels guilty doing so. Emotional boundaries are the medicine right now.</p>



<p>The breakthrough comes on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which activates a major reset around healing, vulnerability, and energetic exchange. Over the next six months, you may redefine how you share space, money, emotions, or power with others. This eclipse can bring sudden clarity around debts, dependencies, or emotional entanglements that need to be transformed. It’s uncomfortable at first, but ultimately liberating. You’re learning that closeness doesn’t have to mean self-sacrifice, and independence doesn’t have to mean isolation.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, the energy shifts in your favor, opening a gentler chapter focused on faith, learning, travel, and spiritual expansion. This flows beautifully with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, which activates your career and life-direction realm. You’re being asked to blend intuition with responsibility and dream with structure. Leadership may feel intimidating, but it’s calling you anyway. This week helps you trust that you can step into visibility without losing your emotional integrity. You’re not meant to hide right now. You’re meant to lead with care.</p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, this week feels like the plot twist you didn’t ask for but secretly needed. As the week opens in the dark of the moon, your relationships take center stage and not in a casual way. You may feel tension, distance, or emotional uncertainty around partners, close friends, or collaborators. This is the final stretch of the Year of the Snake, and it’s asking you to shed relationship dynamics that drain your vitality or keep you performing instead of being real. If something feels off, trust that instinct. You’re not meant to carry connections that dim your light anymore.</p>



<p>The reset arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, landing directly in your relationship realm. This is a big one. Over the next six months, your approach to partnership will radically evolve. New people may enter your life suddenly, or existing relationships may need to renegotiate terms around freedom, equality, and authenticity. With Uranus squaring this eclipse, expect surprises. Not all of them are comfortable, but they are necessary. This eclipse asks you to stop clinging to what looks good on paper and start choosing what actually supports your growth.</p>

It comes from trusting yourself enough to adapt, grow, and let relationships evolve alongside you.</p>

<h2>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Virgo, this is one of those weeks where your nervous system knows what your mind is still trying to rationalize. As the week opens in the dark of the moon, your focus turns to routines, health, work dynamics, and the way you spend your energy day to day. You may notice fatigue, irritation, or a strong urge to clean up systems that feel inefficient or draining. This is the final stretch of the Year of the Snake, and it’s asking you to shed habits that keep you busy but not fulfilled. You don’t need to fix everything at once. You just need to be honest about what’s no longer sustainable.</p>



<p>The turning point arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which resets your relationship with work, wellness, and service. Over the next six months, you may change jobs, shift schedules, adopt new health practices, or redefine what productivity actually means for you.

This eclipse reminds you that efficiency without alignment <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/burnout-at-work-recovery-tips"">leads to burnout</a>. You’re allowed to design a life that works for your body and your spirit.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, attention shifts to your relationships and one-on-one connections. This softer energy blends with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating deep themes around trust, vulnerability, and shared commitments. You’re learning how to balance discernment with openness. This week encourages you to let others meet you halfway rather than carrying everything yourself. You don’t have to be the strong one all the time. Growth now comes from collaboration, not perfection.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Libra, this week opens with a subtle but emotionally charged dark of the moon, stirring your creative life, romantic longings, and desire for joy. You may feel strangely restless, uninspired, or unsure about where your passion has gone. That’s not a block, it’s a clearing. In these final days of the Year of the Snake, you’re being asked to release old narratives around love, attention, and validation. If something no longer feels fun, playful, or heart-expanding, it’s okay to admit that. This is a moment to let go of performative pleasure and reconnect with what genuinely lights you up.</p>



<p>Everything shifts on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which resets this same realm of romance, creativity, and self-expression. Over the next six months, you’re entering a new chapter around how you love, create, and take up space.

This softer energy pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating long-term shifts in your partnership and commitment zone. Big relationship themes are unfolding, starting with how you show up for yourself. This week reminds you that sustainable love and creativity come from alignment, not overcompromise. Let pleasure be honest. Let love be real.</p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, this week begins with a quiet confrontation between who you’ve been and who you’re becoming. As we move through the dark of the moon, old insecurities tied to home, family, and your emotional roots may resurface. You might notice familiar patterns trying to replay themselves, especially in these final days of the Year of the Snake. This isn’t a setback — it’s a moment of recognition. You’re being shown what no longer deserves repetition. The work here is awareness, not self-judgment. You can’t break a cycle you refuse to name.</p>



<p>The turning point arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which activates deep shifts around home, belonging, and emotional safety, while squaring Uranus in your partnership zone. This is liberating energy, even if it feels uncomfortable at first. Over the next six months, you may break free from relationship dynamics that mirror old wounds or finally speak truths you’ve been holding back. Some connections will strengthen because of honesty, while others may fall away because they can’t evolve with you. Either outcome is aligned. This eclipse asks you to choose emotional freedom over familiarity.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, your focus softens toward love, creativity, pleasure, and self-expression. This is a welcome shift after the intensity of the eclipse. It pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating your daily life, work habits, and long-term sustainability. You’re gaining momentum, but the lesson now is pacing. You don’t need to prove anything by overextending yourself. Structure and inspiration can coexist without burnout. This week teaches you that transformation is most powerful when it’s steady, intentional, and kind to your nervous system.</p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, this week feels like a mental and emotional reset that you didn’t know you needed until it arrived. As we move through the dark of the moon, your attention turns to communication, thought patterns, and the stories you tell yourself about where you’re headed. Old narratives, especially ones rooted in fear, comparison, or self-doubt, may resurface in these final days of the Year of the Snake. This is your cue to release them. You’re outgrowing a version of yourself that needed constant reassurance. Trust that clarity will follow honesty.</p>



<p>The breakthrough arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, activating your realm of learning, writing, speaking, and daily exchanges. Over the next six months, your voice evolves. You may launch a project, commit to sharing your ideas more publicly, or shift the way you communicate in close relationships.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, this week begins with a reckoning around worth, security, and what you’re truly building toward. As we move through the dark of the moon, financial concerns, self-esteem patterns, or lingering fears around stability may rise to the surface. In these final days of the Year of the Snake, you’re being asked to release scarcity thinking and outdated definitions of success. If something has required too much effort for too little return, this is your signal. Letting go now creates space for a more aligned foundation to form.</p>



<p>The shift arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, activating your money and values realm. Over the next six months, you may experience a reset around income, priorities, or how you measure your own worth. With Uranus squaring this eclipse, changes may come unexpectedly.

Security now comes from adaptability, not control.</p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, this week is personal in a way you can’t intellectualize your way out of. As the week opens in the dark of the moon in your sign, and the emotional focus lands directly on you… your identity, your body, your sense of self. You may feel unusually sensitive, exposed, or unsure of how you’re being perceived. That’s because something fundamental is shedding. In these final days of the Year of the Snake, you’re releasing an old version of yourself that learned how to survive, not necessarily how to thrive. Let the discomfort speak. It’s showing you where growth is overdue.</p>



<p>Everything changes on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse in your sign, a major reset that will echo for the next six months. This eclipse marks a turning point in how you show up in the world. With the eclipse squaring Uranus, one of your ruling planets, expect disruption, breakthroughs, and moments that force honesty. You may feel pulled between who you’ve been and who you’re becoming, especially in relation to home, family, or emotional security. This is not a quiet evolution. It’s visible. You can’t go back to playing small or staying neutral. The world is responding to the version of you that’s ready to lead differently.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, the focus shifts toward self-worth, money, and values, grounding the intensity of the eclipse into practical reality. This blends with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating your communication and mindset. You’re being asked to take your ideas seriously while still honoring imagination and intuition. The lesson this week is integration. You don’t have to choose between logic and vision. When you trust both, you become a powerful architect of the future you’re here to build.</p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, this week feels like the deep exhale before a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/february-monthly-horoscope-2026-meanings-effects"">brand-new chapter begins</a>. As the week opens with the dark of the moon, you may feel more introspective than usual, pulled toward solitude, memory, and emotional processing. Old fears, habits, or subconscious patterns may surface in these final days of the Year of the Snake, asking for closure. This isn’t about fixing yourself. It’s about forgiveness… of others, of circumstances, and of past versions of you who did the best they could with what they knew.</p>



<p>Everything shifts on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, activating your spiritual, subconscious, and healing realm. This is a powerful internal reset that will unfold quietly but profoundly over the next six months. You may feel called to rest more, create in private, or release attachments that no longer align with your emotional truth. With Uranus squaring the eclipse, sudden realizations or intuitive downloads can arrive unexpectedly. Trust what your inner voice reveals, even if it doesn’t make sense yet.</p>



<p>The tone softens and expands on February 18th as Pisces Season begins, placing the spotlight back on you and your personal journey. This is your time to emerge gently, not rush. It pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, which marks a once-in-a-generation moment of integrating dreams with responsibility. You’re learning that spirituality and structure don’t cancel each other out. They strengthen each other. This week reminds you that your sensitivity is not a liability. It’s the compass guiding you into the next era of your life.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/february-monthly-horoscope-2026-meanings-effects"">Eclipse season is here!</a> The onset of the annual solar and total lunar eclipse is bringing a fateful chance for us to transform. We are shifting our ideas and purpose to find our place in the world. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/yearly-horoscope-2026"">Eclipses help to show us</a> what we need to augment to live a fulfilling existence, and these are no different. The caveat is that we are expected to move forward gracefully, which is hard for anyone, especially since the energy packs a powerful punch that shakes things up unpredictably. Comprehending that some people’s situations and experiences must be shelved or that they must begin a new phase is easier said than done. Compassion for ourselves and others can help us. The only way out is through! See you on the other side!</p>

<h4><strong>The Annular Solar Eclipse In Aquarius</strong></h4>



<p>Take note: February 17th is set to be a momentous day. According to lunar astrology, not only does it usher in the Year of the Fire Horse, but the solar eclipse in Aquarius also occurs at 7:01 a.m. EST. This is the first eclipse that falls on the Aquarius and Leo lunar axis, which makes its formal move into these signs on July 26th. The eclipse activates the coming North Node of Destiny in Aquarius, urging us to usher in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2026-meaning-effects"">a new mindset</a>, and for us all to work cohesively to make global advances. We are a powerful force of nature when we come together.</p>



<p>A “ring of fire” annual solar eclipse is a rare lunar phenomenon that is the result of the moon moving between the sun and earth, while being far from the earth, making the moon look smaller than the sun. The result of the eclipse leaves a fiery look to the circular edges of the moon (in this particular case, the moon will appear that way for two minutes and 20 seconds at the peak of the eclipse). The eclipse is primarily visible from Antarctica. Other regions, such as South America, South Africa, and the Indian Ocean, will have partial views.</p>



<p>The solar eclipse in Aquarius aspects a sensitive point of the sign, known as an anesthetic degree (the 29th degree). The urgency to grow and evolve is immediate. It is giving us a chance to embrace our unique sentiments and let them be known. The collective is changing, and we are evolving our minds with it. Because the planet Uranus, which is in Taurus, is active in the eclipse, it’s fair to say that this is the time of revolution. We are going to stand up for what we believe in and won’t back down. The results may be unpredictable at the moment, but the battle is worth fighting for. </p>

<h4>The Total Lunar Eclipse In Virgo</h4>



<p>On March 3rd at 6:38 a.m. EST, the total lunar eclipse in Virgo intensifies the sky, giving stargazers and astrology lovers an amazing sight to see and capture. The lunar eclipse is a time of release, since it connects to the South Node of Destiny in Virgo (on the current Pisces and Virgo lunar axis). We are departing from old views and emotions, making space for us to explore different philosophies. This is a moment of transcendence and reflection, so take a look back at what recently happened that is sparking a reaction that pushes us to run away from it. </p>



<p>During a total lunar eclipse, the moon appears to take on a reddish hue as it passes over the earth’s shadow. Known as the “Blood Moon,” total lunar eclipses are a moment of illumination and revelation. The lunar eclipse will be visible in the Western Americas, Australia, East Asia, and the Pacific Ocean, lasting around 59 minutes at its totality.</p>



<p>The lunar eclipse in Virgo receives a gentle push from Jupiter retrograde in Cancer, making a difference. Jupiter is known to be the planet of luck, but it can also expand matters that are in a delicate position in either good or bad ways. Problems can become bigger; however, Jupiter always ensures that the results are fortunate. The sting may feel intense at the moment, especially since Mercury retrograde in Pisces is causing ambiguity and confusion. Looking back on the eclipse, we’ll realize that letting go of the past was necessary. The moon in Virgo is a creature of comfort, which is why relinquishing control and healing will be challenging. In the end, it’ll be worth the sacrifice and ride.</p>

<p>So, I’m <strong><em>that</em></strong> friend. The one <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bucket-list-hotels-r29-editor-picks"">booking her hotel</a> on the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/12/11949132/christmas-travel-where-to-stay-hotel-new-york-city"">flight to the destination.</a> The one who buys her <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capsule-wardrobe-guide-tips"">full wardrobe</a> after getting there. The one with a non-existent itinerary and a deeply held belief that, “If we just walk outside, something will appear.” Some may call it impulsive, but I like to call it spontaneity with a little bit of chaos. </p>



<p>I’ll admit it, I’m a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/life-coach-lessons-type-a-personality"">Type A person’s</a> worst nightmare… and I had every intention of staying that way. That is, until Hilton invited me on a press trip with a handful of seasoned travel reporters, people who don’t just travel, but optimize it. Over dinner, two of them walked me through how they use points to unlock upgrades, experiences, and thousands of dollars in savings I didn’t even realize I was leaving behind.</p>



<p>And for my fellow Type B travelers who’ve been raw-dogging their way through travel, here’s how one Hilton-hosted weekend in West LA reformed me<strong>,</strong> without stripping away my go-with-the-flow energy. </p>



<p>I had just moved from New York to Los Angeles when Hilton reached out to host my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grammy-awards-red-carpet-fashion-2026"">Grammy Awards</a> weekend experience.I jumped at the opportunity to attend music’s biggest night and enjoy a little staycation. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959258.jpg?width=784&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=49%3A64"" /></figure>



<p>What I didn’t expect was horseback riding in Malibu, multi-course dinners on property, and a suite bigger than my NYC <em>and</em> LA apartments combined, all tied to <a href=""https://www.hilton.com/en/hilton-honors/"">Hilton Honors,</a> the brand’s loyalty program that gives members access to curated Grammys weekend packages, upgrades, and experiences I genuinely did not know you could redeem with Points.</p>



<p>And before you roll your eyes at the word “points,” I see you. Because if you’re anything like me, “points” sounds like something that requires 47 international flights and a corporate job with unlimited PTO. I am here to tell you: it’s not as unattainable as it sounds. Let’s break it down. </p>



<p>When you book direct or stay at Hilton properties, you earn points you can actually use, either toward free nights or by combining them with cash. You don’t need some impossible balance, you just use what you have.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959270.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>But what surprised me most is that it’s not just about rooms. Through <a href=""https://experiences.hiltonhonors.com/"">Hilton Honors Experiences</a>, Points can unlock actual moments, concert access, VIP sporting events, spa treatments, even Grammy weekend stays at <a href=""https://www.guestreservations.com/waldorf-astoria-beverly-hills/booking?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=969500850&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=969500850&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADiMQMYLTTERfRqL_lLG1CPWgLJh2&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAtLvMBhB_EiwA1u6_PqKbdLKIq-SYBhQbXWPtEgKHvICNxJYZYDbYnfDvDQqr7PLjdqchMBoCXKAQAvD_BwE"">Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills.</a></p>



<p>And then there are the small things that quietly upgrade your life: skipping the front desk with a digital key, choosing your room in advance, late checkout when you need it. And truuuust me, a girl like me will <em>always</em> need a late checkout. </p>



<p>But what if you’re not headed to the Grammys? What if you just want a moment away from the noise?</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959261.png?width=760&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=95%3A128"" /></figure>



<p>That’s exactly how I ended up on the back of a horse overlooking the Malibu coastline. Hilton partnered with a local outfitter and handled the logistics, transportation, timing, the whole setup, so all I had to do was show up. It’s an experience I would never, ever plan for myself, but it pulled me completely out of my comfort zone in the best way.</p>



<p>We split our stay between <a href=""https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/smoolol-oceana-santa-monica/?WT.mc_id=zLADA0AA1OL2PSH3GGL4AMPHTBRD_Oct5GNPLTPMWBRNLAB6SMOOLOL7EN8i142435__z22150182377z__&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;utm_campaign=%7Bcampaign%7D&amp;utm_adgroup=%7Badgroup%7D&amp;utm_keyword=oceana%20santa%20monica&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22150182377&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA-Q0XEachnVMaiJRrASK4anHY1hat&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAtLvMBhB_EiwA1u6_PsQYcgtXE2HDbyA6H3kXeVE9CLM74zjCDXK21WfEO_2Os5I2H-vsfxoCnpoQAvD_BwE"">Oceana Santa Monica</a> and <a href=""https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/laxwawa-waldorf-astoria-beverly-hills/"">Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills</a>, and they could not have felt more different. The Oceana was rooted in serenity and calm, the type of energy Santa Monica is known for. And if you stay there, head downstairs to the La Monique and grab the Escargot Poppers with garlic herb crème fraîche. Yes, they’re fried snails. And yes, they kind of remind me of mozzarella sticks. Soooo good. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959273.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>On the day of the Grammys, we stayed at the Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills. It felt like a slightly elevated experience and definitely had me feeling like a superstar for the day. The bathroom overlooked the city, the suite was polished and luxurious, and everything about it felt Grammys-coded. When my mom came to visit, we definitely had a pinch me moment. We’re just two girls from the deep-south after all! </p>



<p>All of this to say: points are  for everyone — including you, Type B traveler who still loves chaos but doesn’t mind leveling up. We can still, stubbornly, embrace the chaos while making our money stretch. </p>

<p>There’s a lot to talk about when it comes to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fLCdIYShEQ""><em>Wuthering Heights</em></a><em>. </em>I’m sure we’ll be dissecting and debating it for weeks. From the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wuthering-heights-movie-review-heathcliff-controversy"">whitewashing controversy</a> to the <a href=""https://thenerdsofcolor.org/2026/02/09/noc-review-toxic-love-entices-and-torments-in-wuthering-heights/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">toxic love</a> to the <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/article/an-exclusive-first-look-at-the-wild-and-wonderful-costumes-of-wuthering-heights"">daring costumes</a>, the discourse is going to be <em>discoursing</em>. This film, like most everything Emerald Fennell touches, is going to be divisive. And I think that’s part of its charm and its weakness. As The Ringer put it, <em>Wuthering Heights</em> may be “<a href=""https://www.theringer.com/2026/02/11/movies/wuthering-heights-movie-preview-hate-watch"">the hate-watch event of the year.</a>” Except, I didn’t hate it. </p>



<p>I may be one of the few people that don’t think this Heathcliff should have been anything but the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wuthering-heights-movie-review-heathcliff-controversy"">white fantasy Fennell envisioned</a> (let her make the revitionist movie she wants; we should be championing artists of color to create <em>their</em> wildest desires onscreen and pushing Hollywood execs to greenlight them instead), and this may be strange to admit, considering the movie is based on one of the most toxic relationships in literature, but as soon as Cathy and Heathcliff grew into <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/margot-robbie-jacob-elordi-wuthering-heights"">Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi</a>, and they gave us some of the most blistering and intoxicating chemistry I’ve seen onscreen in awhile, I started to enjoy myself. I couldn’t look away. </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tqqhcoQdeQ"">Emerald Fennell’s <em>Wuthering Heights</em></a><em> </em>is a gothic, depressing tragedy of love, lust, loss, and self destruction and yet, it’s also kind of <em>fun</em> (until it’s not, no spoilers). Aside from the absurdity and campiness of the costumes, one of the things I enjoyed most was how unhinged, horny, and mean Cathy could be. And how weird and complicated <a href=""https://www.countryandtownhouse.com/culture/who-is-alison-oliver/"">Alison Oliver’s Isabella Linton</a> was. As Robbie put it, Cathy is “such a bitch.” You can say a lot about Fennell, but she can write female rage (see: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/12/10238043/promising-young-woman-ending-explainer-cassie-death""><em>Promising Young Woman</em></a>) and here, she sets her sights on female desire. </p>



<p>Late last month, the day after I’d seen <em>Wuthering Heights </em>for the first time, I talked to Robbie and Oliver at the film’s fantastical press junket (it was held at The Doheny Estate at <a href=""https://greystonemansion.org/"">the Greystone Mansion and Gardens</a> and there were<em> Wuthering Heights</em>-themed installations throughout the historic grounds) about their characters’ surprisingly refreshinging agency, that much-discussed <a href=""https://www.vulture.com/article/margot-robbie-jacob-elordi-wuthering-heights-press-tour-weird.html"">Robbie-Elordi chemistry</a>, and which costumes shocked them the most.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959156.jpeg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p><strong>Both of these characters are messy. They’re destructive. They’re unapologetic. They put female desire first, which I think is going to piss some people off, but I loved that about them. It would be easy to say that their entire identities are wrapped up in romantic obsession. But talk about how important it was to show that female desire, that all consuming desire, and the choices that these women make for themselves? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Margot Robbie: </strong>Do you know what felt radical? We have a scene — Alison and I — on the swing in the garden, and it’s a scene essentially, where we’re just fight over Heathcliff, and it felt so radical to do a scene like that. The ironic thing is that we’ve fought so hard to not have to do that in movies anymore, but now it’s been so long since — I don’t know if I’ve done a scene like this since I was on the soap opera I was on back in Australia when I was a teenager. It felt so radical to just be two women fighting over a man. It was crazy. “You have him. He’s so handsome. Who you talking about? You could never take him!” It was weirdly exciting to do.</p>

<p><strong>Alison Oliver: </strong>Yeah, it was strange. All of these characters do have — I feel like Emerald really gave them agency in their own ways as well, which within the sort of confines or the period, you do feel like they have agency in some sense. And I think that was important to show. </p>



<p><strong>Absolutely. They have depth and agency.</strong></p>



<p><strong>MR: </strong>Yeah, they all make the choices. And then everything you see in the movie happens because of the choices they make. Whereas usually, even now, when we’re not doing scenes fighting about men, most of the time, you’re usually playing a character that something happens to, and then you watch a movie about the effects of that thing happening to that female character. </p>



<p><strong>AO:</strong> They are the decider.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959158.jpeg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p><strong>MR: </strong>For both of our characters, I feel like we make a choice, we do a thing, and it’s not the right thing in most instances, and then we have to deal with the consequences.</p>



<p><strong>OK, Margot, this does not work unless you and Jacob have the most insane chemistry we’ve ever seen on screen. And you did. I’m always fighting to bring back chemistry, and you guys did it. </strong></p>



<p><strong>MR: </strong>Yes! Chemistry and charisma are two things that I’m like, why can’t we have that? That’s what I want in the movies. Charismatic characters or I want insane chemistry,</p>



<p><strong>Was there a moment where you and Jacob were like, <em>Oh, we got it</em></strong>?</p>



<p><strong>MR: </strong>There were a couple of moments. Even on day one. [We shot] the first scene in the movie where Cathy flings open the bed hangings, and [Heathcliff is] lying in bed. And then we ended up cutting this bit but I walked up over him, and then crouch down and got like <em>this</em> close to his face and told him to, “get up, we’ve got neighbors,” or whatever it was. And we cut that bit because the proximity is something we wanted to save. But, I mean, that was day one, and even then, everyone was kind of like, “Whoa.” And we were like, “Okay, I think this movie’s gonna work.” Also just because she’s throwing something at him, and he’s throwing it back, and he’s like, “What?” There was already an intensity between them that I think we could build on from that point. </p>



<p><strong>Alison, what was it like watching Margot and Jacob build that chemistry? </strong></p>



<p><strong>AO: </strong>Incredible. I kept feeling like I was watching, like an old Hollywood film, like watching Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift. It really was so incredible to see the two of them just inhabit those characters. It was really special.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959160.jpeg?width=1024&amp;height=561&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A561"" /></figure>



<p><strong>We have to talk about the costumes. There were so many moments in my theater that the whole audience gasped at certain costumes. Were there any moments for both of you that you saw a costume you put on and it shocked you? </strong></p>



<p><strong>AO: </strong>We had so many costume changes. Every time, in me and Margot’s rooms — we were next to each other and they put us both in our rooms — it would probably take like, half an hour to get into the outfit, and then we’d both come out of the room at the same time and do a reveal. I never felt like more of a girl in my life. I’d come out and be like, <em>Ah!!</em> [mimics screaming]!! </p>



<p><strong>MR: </strong>You couldn’t control that reaction if you wanted to. And I didn’t want to, but I couldn’t even if I had wanted to. It was so fun.</p>



<p><strong>AO: </strong>[to Margot] Did you have a favorite? </p>



<p><strong>MR:</strong> I think my favorite was on the swing. That costume during the swing scene [was my favorite]. It’s got this black velvet bodice, and this like and this like neck thing, and then this bit’s showing, but then it’s like, got this chainwork in pink rose. We replicated these old couple of paintings of women in that outfit. One woman wore it, got painted in it, and then someone else was like, <em>Well, I want that.</em> And then did it as well. I think there’s three different decades apart where they’ve done this. I was like, <em>wow, that lady was the original Kardashian</em>. Like, did she wear something and everyone was like, “I want to wear what she wore!” </p>

<p><strong>AO: </strong>There’s this shot where Margot is on the swing, and then I think Isabella says something, and [Cathy] twists around. And every time [she] did that, I literally was like, “that’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.” And I would break  character and be like [<em>gasps</em>].</p>



<p><strong>I remember that scene. It’s also a bitchy moment.</strong></p>



<p><strong>MR: </strong>She’s such a bitch, and then swings back around<em> [laughs].</em></p>

<p>When <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/10/11939743/the-pitt-season-2-characters-storyline-release-date"">The Pitt’s</a></em> <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/shabanaazeez_/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shabana Azeez</a> talks about her <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/changing-surname-career-ethnic-discrimination"">career,</a> she traces it back to a single, almost accidental moment of kindness that allowed her to follow a dream that had always been inside her. “I got into acting because a lady was really nice to me one time,” she says, laughing. It sounds flippant, but it’s the truth. She grew up in a family where the arts were not encouraged, academics were the priority, and despite wanting to act her whole life, she never studied drama at school. It wasn’t until she was working at Mercury CX, an emerging filmmakers’ hub in Adelaide, Australia, that someone finally asked her the right question.</p>



<p>Her boss pulled her aside. “She said, ‘You’re great, but this isn’t your passion. What is it?’ And I was like, ‘Well, I’d like to act, but I’ve literally never acted before.'” Within an hour, her boss had secured her an audition for a short film, and she booked it, with no prior acting experience. That led her to secure roles in the animated <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/gemma-chua-tran-lesbian-space-princess-queer"">Lesbian Space Princess</a></em> and the coercive-control thriller <em>Bird Eater</em>. She expresses the same mix of gratitude as she talks about her leap from Australian indie television to <a href=""https://www.hbomax.com/shows/pitt-2024/e6e7bad9-d48d-4434-b334-7c651ffc4bdf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">HBO’s </a><em><a href=""https://www.hbomax.com/shows/pitt-2024/e6e7bad9-d48d-4434-b334-7c651ffc4bdf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Pitt</a></em><a href=""https://www.hbomax.com/shows/pitt-2024/e6e7bad9-d48d-4434-b334-7c651ffc4bdf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">.</a> The contrast, she says, is both extreme and strangely familiar. “It’s chalk and cheese in some ways, and exactly the same in others,” she explains. The budgets are bigger, the access is better, on <em>The Pitt</em>, she can consult real doctors and benefit from an army of specialists, but the core remains unchanged. “Everyone cares about the story.”</p>



<p>When Shabana first read the script for<em> The Pitt </em>she described it as information overload. “It’s like ten series regulars and then a bunch of recurring characters, and then all the patients, and all the names for the doctors are surnames. So you can’t be like, ‘Who’s a woman? Who’s a man? What are their age?’ There’s no clues. I had to go out and buy more highlighters and color-code the entire script,” she says. The audition process for <em>The Pitt </em>was surprisingly lowkey: a single self-tape, followed by a Zoom scheduled for twenty minutes that wrapped after just nine minutes. When the call ended early, she assumed it was a bad sign. “I cried for half an hour afterwards,” she says. “The Zoom was nine minutes. The emotional recovery was three times that.” So when she landed the role, and learned the production would sponsor her visa and fly her halfway across the world it came as a genuine shock.</p>



<p>Moving to LA was, in her words, “horrible in so many ways” and yet also strangely exhilarating. There was a joy in not knowing what came next, in stepping into something undefined. “To not know what you’re stepping into, and to have that curiosity, that scared feeling, that’s what life is about,” she says. Once in Los Angeles, the emotional weight of the move fully settled in. “Oh my god, I knew no one,” she says. “I truly knew not a single person in LA.” That isolation became especially clear during her first days at work. Sitting at lunch during boot camp, she watched as coworkers casually texted friends and loved ones. “Everybody was texting their friends, and I was like, I have no friends to text. They’re all asleep,” she says. “That was really lonely and really scary,” she adds.</p>



<p>Everything shifted when she formed a close friendship with co-star Supriya Ganesh, who plays Dr Samira Mohan. Their bond deepened quickly. “I adore her. I think the world of her,” she says simply. “She’s my best friend.” That sense of shared experience extended into their professional lives as well. Shabana notes that her character wasn’t originally written to be South Asian, but the production pivoted after her audition. “I remember thinking that would never happen because they already had a ‘brown girl’,” she says, pointing to the unspoken limits that still shape representation on screen. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“All of our experiences in the world are embodied experiences, and mine is that of a young brown woman, and that’s not going to change. It was so healing to have somebody there with me.”</p><cite>Shabana azeez</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Season one was filmed in near-total anonymity. By season two, the shift was impossible to ignore. Filming now overlapped with awards season; days were spent on set, nights at the Golden Globes or Critics’ Choice Awards. The pace was punishing. “I got flu-level sick three times,” she admits. Still, amid the noise and spectacle, the work itself never changed. “The show is the same to make,” she says. “And that’s really grounding.” In <em>The Pitt</em>, Shabana plays Victoria, a medical student, a role that could easily collapse into the familiar model minority archetype: hyper-competent, genius-level, and primarily functional. But Shabana was intent on resisting that flattening, shaping Victoria into a character defined as much by her flaws as her intelligence. “When we talk about excellence or prodigies, we tend to think, ‘Let’s play that,’” she says. “But that’s not really how people work. When you’re very good at something, you usually have a deficit that’s just as powerful. For Victoria, it’s social. She’s deeply socially inept.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958220.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>What she loves most about acting is the research. “It’s an exercise in empathy,” she says. Through projects like <em>Bird Eater</em>, where she researched stories of emotional abuse, she found it changed her not only as an actor, but as a person. “Every woman I spoke to had a story. It genuinely changed my life.” Rather than focusing solely on the medical aspects of her role, she immersed herself in romance novels, glossy American teen dramas, and studies of loneliness. Victoria, she explains, is “building a life she doesn’t really want,” and fantasy becomes a form of escape. By Season Two, the show allows that internal tension to surface. “We really dig into the icky parts, her jealousy, her exhaustion, her sharpness. She fails a lot. And I think that’s what actually dismantles the model minority myth.”</p>



<p>When I asked Shabana how she stays grounded amid the whirlwind success of <em>The Pitt</em>, she laughs. “My little brother keeps me really grounded. Honestly, they kind of bully me about it, which is actually kind of helpful. When I went home for Christmas, every time I tried to speak and someone interrupted me, my brother would be like, ‘Everybody, excuse me — Hollywood is trying to speak.’ Before I said anything, my uncle would be like, ‘Action.’ It’s that kind of teasing that reminds me it’s just a job.”</p>



<p>“It brings me back to earth. It’s meaningful work, but it’s art, it’s play, and it’s fun, it’s not brain surgery. I think there’s a real danger of people taking themselves too seriously, and my family bullying me actually really helps with that.”</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2026-02-11/emerald-fennell-wuthering-heights-jacob-elordi-margot-robbie"">Emerald Fennell’s <em>Wuthering Heights</em></a> opens with a scene I hated so much, I almost walked out of the theater. Don’t worry, it goes up from there! The scene in question is a hanging. Two feet dangle from the gallows as an onlooker jokes about the lifeless body’s final unconscious act: a hard on. It’s mentioned later that the perpetrator was a rapist. So the glee in which the spectators (including <a href=""https://classic-literature.fandom.com/wiki/Catherine_Earnshaw"">Catherine “Cathy” Earnshaw</a>) gawk at his erect penis while he is strangled to death is justified. I understand the point — that the story about to unfold is equal parts morbid, horny, irreverent, and uncomfortable — but it just felt like a cheap ploy for shock and awe. The good news is that the rest of the film deals with these conflicting emotions slightly more effectively. And Catherine’s (played in her early years by Charlotte Mellington) curiosity for sex and macabre runs throughout the story, creating a fascinating duality of romance and toxicity, the things <a href=""https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/wuthering-heights-emily-bronte-life?srsltid=AfmBOopEfPLX2S82YU3O5iTObCpeBNCYdMcrYMhooysjNkTh80SZTpkD"">Emily Brontë’s <em>Wuthering Heights</em></a> are known for. But this opening scene is very different from the book’s, and it was just one reason (of many) why I’m glad the Heathcliff in Emerald Fennell’s adaptation of <em>Wuthering Heights</em> is white. </p>



<p>Depending on who you ask, <a href=""https://theconversation.com/was-emily-bront-s-heathcliff-black-85341"">Brontë’s Heathcliff is supposed to be Black or Brown</a>, since he’s described in the novel as a “dark-skinned gypsy in aspect” and a “dirty, ragged, black-haired child.” Another description: “as dark almost as if it came from the devil.” In a <a href=""https://www.vulture.com/article/heathcliff-wuthering-heights-white-jacob-elordi-casting.html?regwall-newsletter-signup=true"">piece for Vulture called <em>Is Heathcliff White?</em>,</a> Jasmine Vojdani writes that, “The idea that Heathcliff might be of African descent first entered academic discussion in the 1950s and gained momentum as postcolonial studies became more popular in the ’80s and ’90s. Scholars have argued that the proximity of Liverpool — one of the biggest slave ports at the time in which Wuthering Heights is set — to the Brontës’ home in Haworth cannot be overlooked.” Vojdani interviews scholars and tries to get to the bottom of this mystery surrounding one of literature’s most famous leading men. One scholar says, “He is both based on the boy of an Indian ruler who’d been orphaned because of the East India Company battles. But he’s also based on an Ashanti warrior’s son.” Another: “The feeling that he should be of African heritage, I think that is interference coming in from [Brontë] sister’s book. Because we do know that in Jane Eyre, Bertha Rochester is born in Jamaica.” Ultimately, Vojdani decides, “By Victorian standards, he’s definitely not white — and likely by ours as well. Is Heathcliff Black? Maybe! It is both historically and textually viable, but he isn’t necessarily Black.” </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959122.jpeg?width=1024&amp;height=569&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A569"" /></figure>



<p>We can debate Brontë’s intentions for decades (and clearly, scholars have), but what’s true in this adaptation is that a white Australian man (<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2026/feb/11/is-jacob-elordi-really-the-hottest-man-on-the-planet-six-things-you-need-to-know"">Jacob Elordi</a>) and a white British boy (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/adolescence-netflix-race-debate-incel-red-pill-culture"">Owen Cooper</a>) play Heathcliff. After watching the film, honestly, it’s for the best. I am not encouraging whitewashing, which let’s be clear is exactly what this adaptation and many before it have done. Canonically, Heathcliff was not white so casting him as such is, in fact, whitewashing. But this is Fennell’s version of the story (I could write a whole other disseration on why she wasn’t the filmmaker to take on this adaptation) and aside from what implications could be drawn from a movie starring a Black man opening with a lynching, I just don’t think this <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2026/02/12/wuthering-heights-movie-heathcliff/"">love story</a> is one I would want to see, or engage in the discourse, if it was a man of color seducing and obsessing over a white woman in this way.</p>



<p>When they are grownups, Heathcliff and Cathy (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/margotrobbieofficial/?hl=en"">Margot Robbie</a>) have a tumultuous and toxic relationship. Heathcliff is surly, cruel, and vindictive. He emotionally terrorizes Isabella Linton (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/alisonjoliver/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Alison Oliver</a>) because he can’t have Cathy. So much so that at a certain point, Isabella crawls on the floor like a dog as he holds onto her collar and makes her bark. While Isabella seems to enjoy this roleplay, it’s uncomfortable to watch. It would take skill, care and precision to pull off this kind of sexual deviance and kink between a consenting couple, let alone between one with a problematic age gap, and power imbalance. I like how female desire is depicted through Isabella, but throw race into the mix and to be frank, I just don’t think Fennell has the range. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959124.jpeg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure></div>



<p>Based on what scholars have deduced and what Brontë wrote, Heathcliff was probably Brown, which is interesting considering Fennell cast Pakistani-British actor Shazad Latif as Edgar Linton, Cathy’s husband, who was definitely white in the books. His race is barely acknowledged in the movie. And same goes for <a href=""https://people.com/wuthering-heights-alison-oliver-hong-chau-interview-exclusive-11895056"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hong Chau’s Nelly</a> (played in youth by Vy Nguyen), Cathy’s live-in maid and best friend, also a white character who is now reimagined as Asian. There’s a brief mention of Nelly’s race, when Cathy’s father says something that implies she should be grateful he took her in. Otherwise, the way race would factor into their volatile friendship is never explored. In another writer-director’s hands, this story would be rife for mining the racial and class tensions of the era. With the right storyteller, I’m all for showing flawed characters of color in toxic relationships. They don’t have to be perfect representations of their race. But, again, I don’t think Fennell has any intention, or the competency, to tackle all of that in her work.  </p>



<p>You realize early on what Fennell is doing. And that this <em>Wuthering Heights</em> is not a straightforward adaptation; it’s her own personal fantasy. She said as much on the <a href=""https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/uk/lifestyle/a70174020/wuthering-heights-film-changes/"">red carpet for the LA premiere</a>: “Everyone who loves this book has such a personal connection to it, and so you can only kind of ever make the movie that you sort of imagined yourself when you read it.” In Fennell’s fantasy, Heathcliff couldn’t possibly be anything but a tall, white man that looks like Elordi. Heathcliff is an object of desire and Fennell’s desires cannot extend beyond her worldview, and clearly, that world is very white. Which is fine, actually. She can make the movie she wants to. And I’d rather not watch a story told by a rich, white woman about the twisted proclivities of a Black or Brown man. I wouldn’t want to see it, and I wasn’t holding my breath waiting for it. And it’s telling that in Fennell’s fantasy, the only people of color, Nelly and Edgar,  are characters who Cathy uses and discards at her pleasure. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>I would rather spend my time championing original work from Black and Brown filmmakers and storytellers than wish for a non-white Heathcliff in Emerald Fennell’s <em>Wuthering Heights</em>. I think that’s a waste of time. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>For the people enraged over this adaptation, I want to ask: what were you expecting? I’m not trying to be condescending, I just genuinely didn’t expect a nuanced rumination on class, race, desire, and abuse from this movie. I watched the trailers, heard Robbie and Fennell talk about the movie, and I’ve seen Fennell’s previous films. I knew what they were trying to do with <em>Wuthering Heights</em>. It’s the spiritual equivalent to the genre of toxic white mess that unfolds in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/12/10785227/succession-black-characters-season-3-review"">TV hits like <em>Succession</em></a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/08/10640659/the-white-lotus-review-the-limits-of-white-self-critique""><em>The White Lotus</em></a><em>.</em> It’s a continuation of the recent trend of modern, magically race-bent, colorblind retellings of beloved literary works, like Netflix’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/08/11082731/color-blind-casting-cons-bridgerton-persuasion""><em>Bridgerton </em>and<em> Persuasion</em></a><em>, </em>and Apple TV’s <a href=""https://tv.apple.com/us/show/the-buccaneers/umc.cmc.g28hcpusm23xbs9zwvnwn9re""><em>The Buccaneers</em></a><em>. </em>It was never going to be that deep. But all <a href=""https://preview.refinery29.com/celebrity-political-statements-grammys-super-bowl?type_id=11958540&amp;site=us&amp;edition_id=1&amp;app=rosetta&amp;type=blog_entry"">art is political</a>, so yes, while white filmmakers should know better and <em>do</em> better, I would rather spend my time championing original work from Black and Brown filmmakers and storytellers than wish<strong> </strong>for a non-white Heathcliff in Emerald Fennell’s <em>Wuthering Heights</em>. I think that’s a waste of time. There is inevitably going to be an onslaught of thinkpieces and TikTok rants dedicated to chastising this casting. Sure, let’s call out whitewashing, but instead of expending all our energy on begging for scraps from white Hollywood, let’s support our own. </p>



<p>I’d rather focus on making sure <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7574286690517404958""><em>The Gilded Age</em></a><em> </em>gets 17 seasons (its co-showrunner is <a href=""https://deadline.com/2025/10/the-gilded-age-sonja-warfield-anonymous-content-1236590863/"">Sonja Warfield</a>, a Black woman) and the upcoming adaptation of <a href=""https://deadline.com/2024/03/the-davenports-ya-novel-prime-video-alloy-entertainment-1235846686/""><em>The Davenports</em></a><em> </em>(also brought to you by Warfield), gets all the hype it deserves than try to make this <em>Wuthering Heights </em>into something it was never going to be. I’d rather watch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/belle-bridgerton-black-period-drama"">Amma Asante’s <em>Belle</em></a> again and support whatever work she’s got in the pipeline. I’d rather push for execs to greenlight anything and everything <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/10/11939097/hedda-movie-review-tessa-thompson-interview"">Nia DaCosta is going to do next</a>. I’d rather uplift <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/alyssa-cole-when-no-one-is-watching-interview"">Alyssa Cole</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ladriana_herrera/?hl=en"">Adrianna Herrera</a>, <a href=""https://vanessariley.com/"">Vanessa Riley</a>, and the countless other Black and Brown woman historical romance writers than force Fennell to change her warped fantastical version of Heathcliff and Cathy’s ill-fated love story into anything other than what it is. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959136.jpeg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>So let’s get into what <em>is</em> onscreen and whether that is worth your time. This may surprise you, but I actually think it might be. When I settled into Fennell’s <em>Wuthering Heights</em> world, and got over the unnecessary shock tactic of that opening scene, I started to enjoy myself. For better and for worse, I was entertained. Elordi and Robbie (who the internet also swore was miscast because of her age) are electric together. I think their chemistry makes the whole thing worth it. </p>



<p>In the story that Fennell is telling, their chemistry is the one thing that needs to work, and it does. I believe that these two people would tear the world — and themselves — apart to be together. I also believe that they want to tear each other’s clothes off. They are so down bad for each other, inanimate objects that are slightly sexual set them ablaze. Chemistry often feels like a lost art and it was refreshing to see good, old-fashioned, horny-ass onscreen attraction. And for the first time, I understood the global thirst for Jacob Elordi. While Robbie’s Cathy is spunky, stubborn, and independent, Elordi’s Heathcliff is brooding, desperate, and clingy. He’s a real yearner and this may mean that I need some serious therapy, but I was <em>into it. </em></p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959130.jpeg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>A friend of mine went to an early screening of the movie as well and his review was simply, “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzPpZwSDcRo"">gowns, beautiful gowns</a>” and he’s not wrong, but I think it’s more than that. The costumes are absurd, but in this cinematic world, that’s a compliment! This movie thrives in absurdity and extravagance. There were moments when Robbie as Cathy walked into the frame and I had an audible reaction to her costume. Sure, at times, that took me out of the story, but if they were going to gasp-inducing costume design moments, they succeeded. Visually, <em>Wuthering Heights</em> is stunning. It nails the gloomy, overcast foreboding rolling hills that the source material describes while also injecting shots of color, humor, and exuberance into the film’s aesthetic. In spite of the depressing subject matter, this <em>Wuthering Heights </em>is more camp than melancholy. </p>



<p>The film will probably never beat the style over substance accusations, understandably, but for me, the performances are the best part. Chau is perfectly exasperated and defiant. Latif is doting and oblivious yet likeable. Oliver is intoxicating and exhilarating to watch. And Elordi and Robbie lean so hard into the <a href=""https://www.vulture.com/article/review-finally-a-smooth-brained-wuthering-heights.html"">“smooth-brained sensuality”</a> of Fennell’s adaptation that it’s not hard to believe they were <a href=""https://www.eonline.com/news/1427555/jacob-elordi-margot-robbie-bond-on-wuthering-heights-set"">obsessed with each other on set</a>. </p>



<p>The audiences who show up to the theater on Valentine’s Day hoping for a feel-good romance may leave a bit traumatized (just like I was when I first read <em>Wuthering Heights </em>in high school), but they’ll also buy into the splendor and pageantry of this movie. And they’ll understand why Elordi and Robbie are two of the most in-demand talents of their generation. I do wish that a Black-led, Black-directed film — or one made by and for people of color — was getting the same over-the-top treatment, star-making potential, and <em>budget</em>, but until we start yelling more about why we aren’t seeing those stories greenlit, funded, and released, we’ll be stuck in our own fantasy. Fennell’s warped, whimsical, white-as-hell fever dream may be a compelling watch, but it’s <em>her </em>imagination come to life. I want to imagine a world in which the weird whims of Black and Brown filmmakers are able to be awakened too. </p>

<p>If, like me, your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dermatologist-skincare-advice-2026"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">skincare routine</a> rarely stretches beyond a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-inkey-list-hydrating-cream-to-milk-cleanser-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">simple cleanser</a> and a basic moisturizer <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-multi-antioxidant-radiance-serum-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">or serum</a> — but this is the year you’ve vowed to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/skincare-trends-2026"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">step things up a notch</a> — then investing in an LED light wand might just be the answer. </p>



<p>Chances are your TikTok feed is already flooded with influencers and skincare enthusiasts bathing in red, green — even purple — light, with full-coverage <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-led-light-face-masks"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">LED masks</a> the sci-fi tool of choice. But as a beauty director who’s tried most of them, some can be heavy and uncomfortable, leave you feeling sweaty, or make it seem like your eyes are taking a hit. (How people manage to read or watch TV while wearing them, I’ll never know.) </p>



<p>For me, LED wands offer a far more comfortable — and not to mention more targeted — experience. </p>



<h2>What are LED wands and what are the skincare benefits? </h2>



<p>LED wands offer everything you love about an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/led-face-mask-red-light-skin-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">LED mask</a> — often harnessing red and blue light — but in a far more compact form. Esthetician <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/daniellegambleskin/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Danielle Gamble</a> says, “Red light builds collagen, speeds cellular repair [essentially healing skin], and calms inflammation.” Sure enough, several studies have found that red light can help <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10311288/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">boost collagen and elastin,</a> two things that keep skin strong and supple.  </p>



<p>Then there’s blue light: “[This] helps kill acne-causing bacteria and reduces active breakouts,” says Gamble. While there’s less research on blue light and skin, mounting anecdotal evidence suggests it’s especially useful for treating pimples. I’m convinced that <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Fmedicube-age-r-booster-pro-pink-edition-1-set-english-version%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1130943349"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medicube’s Booster Pro</a> helped significantly minimize a large, painful chin breakout recently. LED wands are also nifty enough to reach trickier areas, like under the eyes. </p>



<h2>What’s the difference between an LED wand and an LED mask? </h2>



<p>Gamble says, “Wands are typically more cost-effective and allow for targeted treatment, which is useful if you’re focusing on specific areas like active breakouts or fine lines.” The trade-off? “They require manual use, so you need to hold the wand and move it from area to area,” she adds. </p>



<p>Because LED wands only work when applied correctly and consistently, Gamble recommends regular, measured use. While she says that masks are <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-beauty-led-face-mask-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">better for full-face results</a>, wands excel at spot treatment and precise application. </p>



<h2>Who are LED wands best suited for? </h2>



<p>LED wands may take a bit more attention and thought than an LED mask, but Gamble says handheld wands are ideal for targeted concerns: “Think the occasional breakout or fine lines in a specific area you want to address,” she says. </p>



<p>Intrigued? Here are the best LED wands to add to your wish list, depending on your skin concerns.  </p>

<p>My beauty editor peers can’t stop talking about this smart LED wand, and that’s because it does the most. The electroporation setting helps thick moisturizers and masks sink into the skin, while the gentle microcurrent acts like Pilates for facial muscles, boosting firmness instantly and over time. But it’s the light settings that really make it worth the price. Blue light helps calm raised pimples, red light encourages skin healing, green light is said to boost <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10084420/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">collagen production</a>, and orange light <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6181673/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">supports skin repair</a>. I like that it’s lightweight, which makes targeting specific areas much less of a chore. I reach for it whenever I have a hormonal pimple that concealer can’t cover — and I’m pretty sure it helps deflate them. </p>

<p>This slim wand may look unassuming, but it’s like a mini at-home facial. I — and hundreds of other reviewers — love that it warms up, making every pass over stressed skin feel incredibly soothing. Beyond its comforting heat, the rotating wand also uses red light to help stimulate collagen and elastin, and its compact size means it can easily reach under the eyes where fine lines often appear. </p>

<p>This LED device is a bit chunkier than others, but that actually works in its favor since it covers a larger surface area, making it excellent value for money. It’s especially handy for bigger zones like the jawline, cheeks, or forehead, and it even comes with goggles to protect your eyes. The multiple red-light wavelengths help reduce inflammation, calming redness from clusters of pimples. </p>

<p>NuFace devices are beloved by R29 staff — and for good reason: the brand thinks of absolutely everything. At its core, this is an LED device, packed with red, amber, and infrared lights. Skin absorbs red and infrared light more easily, helping to kickstart regeneration and encourage newer, healthier skin cells. It also includes a microcurrent attachment with conductor gels. When used consistently, microcurrent can provide a temporary lift. You can even pair it with an app to boost the power. Genius. </p>

<p>This tool cleverly combines red and blue lights to increase collagen in the skin and help eliminate the bacteria that can cause breakouts. The five-star reviews speak for themselves, with users noting reduced acne and less severe scarring. Even better, it’s fast — treatments last just three minutes, and the device automatically shuts off when time’s up. Again, consistency is key to achieving good results. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2F6-in-1-beauty-therapy-wand-for-the-face-eyes-neck%2F7917716"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glow24K 6-IN-1 Beauty Therapy Wand for the Face, Eyes &amp; Neck, $99.99</a> </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958977.jpg?width=668&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=167%3A256"" /></figure>



<p>This wand was designed with delicate skin in mind, especially the under-eyes. Depending on the concern you want to target, you can switch the panel between blue and red light. Treatments take just five to 10 minutes, so you can use it while watching TV or getting ready for bed. The heat and vibration feel especially good because you’re meant to maneuver it over the face; it requires a little more thought than other wands, but the process feels therapeutic. </p>
