<h4>What impact does digitization of electoral process actually have?</h4><figure><img alt=""Image of a hand dropping a ballot inside of a computer"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fALUsm56qBpcYPmPfWG2fQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image of a hand dropping a ballot inside of a computer</figcaption></figure><p>The mayoral election is around the corner in my hometown of Montreal, so I wanted to confirm whether I was registered to vote at my current address. What I naively assumed would be a simple task turned out to require a trip to a local community centre. I gave my name, they flipped through a binder, and gave me the thumbs up within 3 seconds of arriving. It felt like the ultimate “this could have been an email” moment and I lost two hours of my day confirming something I should’ve been able to check online in those 3 seconds.</p><p>Technology isn’t a silver bullet, and I’m far from a techno-optimist, but it <em>can </em>be a powerful vector for improvement. When designed carefully, it can increase accessibility, surface critical information, maybe even make it easier for people to engage civically in this context. For a long time, I assumed the main reason we hadn’t digitized more of the democratic process was good old-fashioned bureaucracy, a sluggish, underfunded government with outdated tools. I held a fundamental belief that if we simply made it easier to vote by letting people cast ballots from their phones or laptops more people <em>would</em>! More access = more engagement.</p><p>So I decided to investigate some interesting examples of places where they’ve managed to digitize their electoral process and see what the results were!</p><figure><img alt=""Markhamian looking at an digital ballot on an iPad"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*Pnh_PCN3gDlRGcYk"" /><figcaption>Markhamian looking at an digital ballot on an iPad</figcaption></figure><h3>Markham’s digital experiment</h3><p>We’ll start with an interesting homegrown example. <a href=""https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&amp;dir=rec/tech/consult&amp;document=p5&amp;lang=e"">In 2003, the City of Markham,</a> a suburb north of Toronto, launched one of Canada’s first pilot projects to enable online voting in a municipal election. The initiative was small at first but had the ambitious aim of testing whether residents could safely and securely cast a ballot from their home computers!</p><p>As is often the case with public sector innovation, the city didn’t have the money or in-house expertise to develop its own secure digital voting infrastructure so it turned to a third-party vendor called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scytl"">Scytl</a>, a Spanish company that specialized in using cryptography to secure elections. The way the system works is each eligible voter receives a Voter Information Letter by mail, this includes a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN). Then during the advance voting period, Markhamians? Markhamites? People from Markham would go to Markham’s election website, hosted by Scytl, enter their PIN, and authenticate their identity with personal information (such as date of birth and postal code) matched against the city’s registry. Once verified, they could cast their vote through a digital ballot interface! And voila, the vote was then encrypted and transmitted to a secure election server, where it remained sealed until game day(election day).</p><p>Seems straight-forward enough right? And, cherry on top, according to city officials, online voting participation increased in each cycle, particularly among seniors and people with mobility limitations! But here’s the kicker: despite the relatively simple process, turnout didn’t budge. Most of the people who voted online were the same people who would’ve voted anyway.</p><p>Unfortunately, Markham’s experiment became a reference point across Canada informing other municipalities’ approaches to digital voting. Also more importantly, the third party system that Markham was relying on, Scytl, eventually filed for <a href=""https://www.lavanguardia.com/economia/20200514/481138885893/scytl-sandton-capital-liquidacion-venta-negocio-juez-voto-electronico.html"">bankruptcy in 2020, citing over €75 million</a> in debt. Causing us to ask the question: what happens when the company holding your digital ballots no longer exists? Without money to invest in an internal system and having to rely on third parties, can be potentially devastating. What if Scytl had gone bankrupt, during an election? Needless to say, Markham no longer allows e-voting, which makes me e-sad.</p><figure><img alt=""ivote interface showing how votes could be stolen"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*I7c20DI7UwdOvEO3.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/1504.05646"">A proof of concept, that shows the exploit against iVote to inject malicious code that would surreptitiously manipulate the voter’s choices</a></figcaption></figure><h3>When e-voting went wrong</h3><p>While Markham was a valiant attempt, it was small potatoes dealing with local politics and might not in and of itself be representative of the potential impact of online voting at a national level. So let’s look at an example of how things can go, very, very wrong and very right. Starting with the bad.</p><p>In 2015, New South Wales Australia rolled out the <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05646?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">world largest ever e-vote</a> system called iVote. This system allowed voters to cast their ballots online during the state election. Again the goal was to increase accessibility for people with disabilities and those living remotely, while also trying to modernize the voting experience by letting people vote from personal devices.</p><p>iVote purportedly was actually quite a nice app and the user experience was smooth and intuitive. Public communication about this new way of voting was also strong, causing nearly 280,000 votes to be cast using iVote in that election! Trouble is, in the days following the election, some pesky independent researchers discovered <a href=""https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-22270-7_3""><strong>severe vulnerabilities</strong></a> in the live system. Among them: an insecure external analytics script that could have allowed attackers to intercept or alter votes, and a verification process that could be manipulated to provide false assurances to voters.</p><p>What’s worse, there is no clear evidence of tampering, but the possibility was there and because of this they will never try to pilot a program like this again. This may have very well affected who took office and the downstream impacts of that are no joke. The point of this example is to highlight what is at stake if the system goes south, or should I say New South (I’m sorry). In this case, there was no clear evidence of hacking but the vulnerability existed and may have been exploited to favour one candidate or another. With consequences this high, how important is the convenience of voting online in contrast?</p><p><a href=""https://www.innovationaus.com/ivote-written-out-of-nsw-law-as-digital-voting-review-begins/"">iVote was quietly shelved</a> in the years that followed. They had lost the trust of the public despite a lack of evidence of hacking and what began as a promise of a modern democracy ended up as a prime example of how important security is in this conversation. The lesson from New South Wales is clear: building digital voting systems isn’t just about making them easy to use, it’s about making them impossible to doubt. And that requires more than good design. It requires deep, structural transparency, independent oversight, and a willingness to stop and re-assess when trust begins to weaken.</p><figure><img alt=""Image showing Estonia’s digital ID card"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Wds6woYpODxmW6Pv.jpg"" /><figcaption>Example of Estonias Digital ID card</figcaption></figure><h3>The shining beacon of Estonia</h3><p>Lastly, I’d like to pull up the most frequently cited example of a successful techo-democracy. Estonia! A small but mighty nation that is often on the cutting edge. They were the first country to launch internet voting at a national level in <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4343374.stm"">2005</a>. Their system called i-voting, allowed citizens to cast their ballots online from any internet connected device, for both national and municipal elections. When it initially rolled out, online adoption was around <a href=""https://www.valimised.ee/en/archive/statistics-about-internet-voting-estonia"">2%</a> in the first year but it has since climbed to over <a href=""https://www.valimised.ee/en/archive/statistics-about-internet-voting-estonia"">40%</a> of its population using online voting.</p><p>But, the reason this is possible is because unlike most countries, Estonia had spent the prior decade building a national digital identity card. This is a critical part of the puzzle unfortunately, and it’s what allows their digital voting program to be so successful. They already use their digital ID’s to file taxes, access their own medical records, and sign legal documents. So when the opportunity came to use this same, state-backed secure authentication method, it was a no brainer. They had the full infrastructure to roll it out.</p><p>Their i-Voting process is built for security and usability. Voters insert their <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_identity_card"">digital ID card</a> (or they can use a mobile app), log into a government portal, and are presented with a digital ballot. Once completed, their vote is encrypted and then sent to a secure server. To guard against coercion or vote buying, voters can re-vote multiple times online. This protects against a common concern people have in e-voting, which is buying votes! Only their final submission is counted. And if someone chooses to vote in person on election day, it overrides any previous digital votes. Pretty ingenious.</p><p>Crucially, Estonia’s system includes end-to-end cryptographic verification. Voters can use a smartphone app to verify that their encrypted ballot was received and counted as intended without revealing who they voted for. The entire system is publicly audited, with detailed post-election reviews conducted by independent experts.</p><p>The Estonian system really is as good as it gets when it comes to a thoughtful, comprehensive and secure approach to digitizing democracy, and because of its long history it also offers us some concrete data on what effect digitization has on voter turnout. So here it is: 0.2 to 0.8 percentage points. That’s it. From 2005 to 2025. The painful truth is that if you’re looking to get more empowered citizens, focusing on access to voting is actually the last step in the process.</p><p>There are tangibly good reasons to invest in e-voting and they genuinely matter. From an accessibility standpoint alone, giving people with reduced mobility the ability to vote independently and securely is a powerful step forward. That, in itself, is worth the effort.</p><p>But if the goal is to dramatically increase engagement, we’re nowhere near a solution and I’m confident that the solution won’t be a purely technological one. What I uncovered is, if you care about people voting, it’s clear that access, especially technological access, is not the main bottleneck.</p><p>We need to stop obsessing over the ballot interfaces and start asking harder questions. Why don’t people vote in the first place? What would make them want to?</p><p>That’s where the real design challenge lies and that’s where we should be putting our energy!</p><p>P.S Don’t forget to vote in your next election</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=cfd6674465a2"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/can-technology-fix-voting-cfd6674465a2"">Can technology fix voting?</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

After testing both tools, the results revealed that a product designer can truly prototype with real code and the help of <strong>Figma MCP</strong>.</p><p>With a solid design system in place, design and code share the same language, AI becomes a reliable partner, accelerating exploration and producing maintainable, real-world prototypes that teams can carry forward.</p><h3>The problem</h3><p>If you are a designer already experimenting with AI tools, you know this feeling: gorgeous prototypes that, after looking at the code, are totally disconnected from the codebase your team is using and practically useless.</p><p>I’ve explored multiple AI tools myself to speed up my design workflow, but something was always missing. I tried <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/designing-with-prompts-a-product-designers-journey-into-exploring-ai-tools-116aefa70966""><strong>Replit, Lovable, v0</strong>, and <strong>Bolt</strong></a> only to end up with prototypes built with generic code, based on <strong>Shadcn</strong> or <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>. They didn’t align with the existing code, and couldn’t be reused in production.</p><p>This changed significantly with <strong>MCP servers</strong>, and in my <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/designing-with-mcp-server-bridging-design-systems-and-ai-for-developer-friendly-prototypes-4f08b0a0881d"">previous article</a>, I was optimistic enough to imagine a workflow where designers could instantly prompt rough ideas to prototypes, while also pulling from existing code and design tokens. This time, I brought this vision to life using <strong>Code Connect UI </strong>and its improved features like component mapping and MCP instructions.</p><p>In this article, I will share how I built an AI-ready workflow using agentic CLI tools like <strong>Claude Code</strong> and <strong>Codex CLI</strong>, combined with <strong>Figma</strong> <strong>MCP</strong> and <strong>Code</strong> <strong>Connect UI</strong>, to turn high-level prompts into production-ready code that directly reflects my design system and codebase.</p><h3>From Cursor to agentic CLI tools</h3><p>Cursor was my first real look into what AI-assisted coding could look like. But soon after, agentic CLI tools like Claude Code came to play offering more control and capabilities, making AI integration into traditional workflows more efficient than any other IDE plugin ever did before.</p><p>I began exploring Claude Code and Codex CLI, two command-line tools from <strong>Anthropic</strong> and <strong>OpenAI</strong>. Both can run locally inside a terminal or IDE, with immediate access to their respective models, and integrate with MCP<strong> </strong>Servers for external tool access.</p><figure><img alt=""Codex CLI terminal screenshot: A screenshot of a terminal running Codex CLI.

While IDEs act as middlemen, translating user requests through APIs or extensions, agentic CLIs connect directly to the models themselves, making interactions faster, more contextual, and more reliable.</p><p>This direct connection enables a truly agentic experience: Claude Code and Codex CLI don’t just respond to prompts; they reason, plan, and adapt within a project.</p><figure><img alt=""A comparison diagram showing how AI-powered IDEs like Cursor and VS Code communicate with Claude through intermediary tools versus how Claude Code connects directly to the model.

One where every color, type, scale, and component carries the same meaning in both Figma and code. Then, use that shared structure to build production-ready prototypes from simple prompts or wireframes.</p><p>To achieve this, I aligned Figma variables with CSS tokens, ensuring MCP Server, Claude Code, and Codex<strong> </strong>CLI all spoke the same design language, starting from the foundations.</p><p>The result was:</p><ul><li>A design system perfectly aligned with code</li><li>React components mapped to their corresponding design versions using Figma MCP and Code Connect</li><li>Storybook documentation for all the components</li><li>A GitHub repository for traceability</li><li>An automated workflow process for orchestrating the agentic CLI tools running in my project</li></ul><p>Building around these foundations was crucial. At the end of the day, when design and code share the same language, designers and developers don’t have to make assumptions, and similarly, AI tools don’t have to guess.</p><h3>Preparing and organizing the Figma file</h3><p>What makes perfect sense for every product designer is <em>structure</em>. In any design system, structure defines clarity, and documentation defines purpose. Together, they form the bridge that helps both humans and AI make accurate decisions about how design maps to code.</p><p>The design foundations must be well-defined and closely aligned with code. In my case, the Figma variables were not only given a name, but they were directly mapped to their code syntax, which in this case were CSS variables. This mapping is essential not only for smoother collaboration between designers and developers but also for making AI workflows possible by reducing ambiguity.</p><figure><img alt=""Figma variables mapped to CSS tokens: A screenshot from Figma’s variables panel listing color variables (e.g., black, white, grey‑200) alongside numeric scales and mapped values.

From day one, I was impressed with how Code Connect integrated more seamlessly with <strong>Figma MCP</strong>, while also connecting to <strong>GitHub</strong> repositories, creating a stronger and more reliable connection between design and code.</p><figure><img alt=""Figma Code Connect UI with GitHub: A screen showing Figma Code Connect UI for a checkbox component.

My goal wasn’t only to make Claude Code generate components from designs, <strong>but</strong> <strong>to reuse the proper tokens, syntax, and patterns that already existed in the codebase</strong>.</p><h4>Project structure</h4><p>I built a<strong> React + Vite</strong> codebase, structured around three core folders:</p><ul><li><strong>styles</strong>: with <em>primitives.css</em>, <em>semantic.css</em>, and <em>components.css</em></li><li><strong>components</strong>: where each component included its .<em>tsx</em>, .<em>stories.tsx</em>, and .<em>css</em> file</li><li><strong>pages</strong>: a directory used for testing prototypes</li></ul><p>I provided both primitive and semantic CSS variables to establish a solid foundation of design tokens. With the help of the Figma MCP Server, Claude Code was then instructed to populate the components CSS file and implement the corresponding React components by referencing and applying those variables.</p><h4>Working with Claude Code</h4><p>The best way to work with Claude Code is within an <strong>IDE</strong> such as <strong>VS Code</strong>, either via terminal or its official extension. That way, code changes appear directly in the IDE, even if it is running in the terminal.</p><figure><img alt=""VS Code terminal: A screenshot of a dark terminal within VS Code running Claude Code.

It needs to always know how to perform a task and under what conditions. When it runs, it consumes both time and tokens, which can come at a cost (especially if you are using API pricing), so the goal is to optimize its workflow to always follow the shortest, most accurate route.</p><p>To do that, I created a centralized file at the root of my repository that outlined the project structure and defined how Claude Code should behave across the entire project when handling different tasks. These guidelines included information such as which MCP Servers and tools should be used, when to run verification checks on the implementation, which naming convention should be followed for new files, and other details.</p><figure><img alt=""CLAUDE.md files illustration: Illustration of a central yellow folder connected to three subfolders below it, representing an organized project structure.

These files became the governance layer of my design system, ensuring that every implementation went through structured verification before being approved, and specific steps were consistently followed. The <em>root</em> file defines the global steps, while directories like <em>styles</em> and <em>components</em> have their own localized rules.</p><p>This modular approach led to faster responses and better accuracy. Each directory had its own <em>CLAUDE.md</em> file with localized instructions, like defining the format of the output I expected to get from Claude when it performed validation checks on components:</p><pre>#### Component-Specific Matrix Examples:<br /><br /><br />##### Button Matrix:<br />| Element | Property | Default | Hover | Active | Focus | Disabled |<br />|---------|----------|---------|-------|--------|-------|----------|<br />| Container | Background | #123c80 | #0c2855 | #092341 | #123c80 | #b7b8b9 |<br />| Container | Border | none | none | none | 2px outline | none |<br />| Text | Color | #fff | #fff | #fff | #fff | #6f7071 |<br />| Icon | Color | #fff | #fff | #fff | #fff | #6f7071 |<br />| Icon | Transform | none | none | scale(0.95) | none | none |<br /><br /><br />##### Card Matrix:<br />| Element | Property | Default | Hover | Selected | Focus | Disabled |<br />|---------|----------|---------|-------|----------|-------|----------|<br />| Container | Shadow | sm | md | lg | outline | none |<br />| Container | Transform | none | translateY(-2px) | none | none | none |<br />| Title | Color | #3c3e3f | #123c80 | #123c80 | #3c3e3f | #6f7071 |<br />| Description | Color | #6f7071 | #6f7071 | #5b5c5d | #6f7071 | #b7b8b9 |<br />| Icon | Opacity | 0.8 | 1 | 1 | 0.8 | 0.4 |</pre><p>This analysis compared the styling consistency of components against their Figma versions, producing a matrix to help Claude identify discrepancies in structure or token usage with precision:</p><figure><img alt=""Claude’s output matrix: A terminal screenshot presenting Claude’s output matrix.

Meanwhile, the main agent maintains a slightly expanded context window without becoming overloaded. It’s important to note that <strong>a larger context window doesn’t always mean better performance</strong>; it often leads to vaguer reasoning and a higher risk of errors.</p><h4>Optimizing the agents’ workflow</h4><p>Making it easy for the agent to understand when to split a task and which agent to invoke is crucial. In my setup, the root file lists all available agents, ensuring Claude is always aware of which one to use and under which circumstances.</p><pre>## Available Agents (Overview)<br /><br />1. **design-verification**: For verifying component implementations match Figma designs and use correct tokens<br />2. **component-composition-reviewer**: For component creation/modification with nested components<br />3. **figma-code-connect-generator**: For ALL Code Connect related tasks<br />4. **token-analyzer**: For analyzing component token usage patterns and optimization recommendations<br />5. **a11y-accessibility-orchestrator**: Main coordinator for comprehensive accessibility audits using Playwright MCP and axe-core<br />6. **a11y-wcag-compliance-auditor**: Specialized WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA compliance testing and legal compliance assessment<br />7. **a11y-color-contrast-specialist**: Expert color contrast analysis <br />8. **a11y-keyboard-navigation-tester**: Comprehensive keyboard accessibility testing and validation<br />9. **a11y-screen-reader-tester**: Screen reader compatibility and ARIA implementation testing<br />10. **claude-md-compliance-checker**: MANDATORY final step for EVERY task</pre><p>All agents were assigned to distinct responsibilities and triggered under specific conditions or manually when needed. Certain rules were also established to ensure that Claude never skipped or overrode these validations.</p><pre>## Quality Gates &amp; Blocking Rules<br /><br />### Cannot Proceed If:<br />- design-verification finds violations (when applicable)<br />- component-composition-reviewer finds violations (when applicable)<br />- token-analyzer recommends changes (when applicable)<br />- Build fails<br />- Lint fails<br />- claude-md-compliance-checker finds violations<br /><br />### If An Agent Fails:<br />1. Fix ALL reported issues<br />2. Re-run the agent<br />3. Only proceed when it passes<br />4. Then run claude-md-compliance-checker</pre><p>At the end of each task, my <strong>compliance-checker</strong> agent ensured that Claude had successfully followed the workflow outlined in the root <em>CLAUDE.md</em>. If not, then Claude would iterate again, fixing all the flagged issues before marking the task as complete.</p><p>The <strong>design-verification </strong>agent also had another crucial role,<em> </em>continuously validating that all React components matched the original Figma designs.</p><pre>name: design-verification<br />description: Use this agent to verify that component implementations match <br />their Figma design specifications. This agent automatically extracts design <br />data from Figma, analyzes component implementations, and ensures proper design <br />token usage and visual property compliance.<br /><br /># Tool Restrictions<br />tools: [&quot;Read&quot;, &quot;Grep&quot;, &quot;Glob&quot;, &quot;WebFetch&quot;, &quot;mcp__figma__get_code&quot;, <br />&quot;mcp__figma__get_variable_defs&quot;, &quot;mcp__figma__get_screenshot&quot;, <br />&quot;mcp__figma__get_metadata&quot;]</pre><p>This system of subagents and automation turned my workflow into a self-regulating environment. The next step was to extend this framework with <strong>MCP servers</strong>, enabling my agentic CLI tools to operate beyond their local boundaries.</p><h3>Beyond local boundaries by integrating MCP Servers</h3><p>I’ve already mentioned the <strong>Figma MCP Server</strong> and how crucial it is for bridging design and code in my <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/designing-with-mcp-server-bridging-design-systems-and-ai-for-developer-friendly-prototypes-4f08b0a0881d"">previous article</a>. What unlocks Claude Code’s and Codex CLI’s potential even further is their ability to interact with a wider range of <strong>external toolsets</strong> to perform actions that were previously impossible.</p><p>By connecting them to multiple MCP Servers, my CLI environment became much more than a local sandbox. It could navigate, test, and verify components in real time on <strong>Storybook</strong>, or fetch design context directly from Figma, all within a single prompt.</p><figure><img alt=""A diagram showing how Claude Code integrates with external tools via MCP servers. “Claude Code” sits at the center, connected to the “Playwright MCP” on the left and “Figma MCP” on the right. Each MCP lists its available tools — Playwright includes browser navigation and form tools, while Figma includes screenshot, metadata, and design context tools. The diagram illustrates how Claude Code uses these integrations to test interfaces and fetch design data."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*N4tiPRMhYSGA4AhVKFR8nw.png"" /><figcaption><em>MCP integrations connecting Claude Code to tools from Playwright and Figma.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The diagram above shows two of my most valuable integrations. One way to provide Claude with feedback is by sharing a screenshot, asking for a visual misalignment fix. A better way is to let Claude experience the misalignment itself, opening the browser, inspecting the interface, and analyzing the issue in real-time.</p><p>This is one of the many cases where <strong>Playwright MCP</strong> and its browser-level tools allowed Claude to test component interactions, collect console data, or even simulate user behavior during validation.</p><p>Combined with Figma MCP and other integrations, these workflows become truly agentic and automated. Subagents can now run these tools independently to perform validation checks while pulling design context from Figma and behavioral data from the browser simultaneously.</p><h3>Exploring Codex CLI</h3><p>For my experiment, Claude Code acted as the builder, and Codex CLI as the reviewer. I initially started using Codex CLI to verify Claude Code’s implementation and plan fixes. It proved especially helpful for accessibility improvements and code refinement, often suggesting more consistent or efficient component structures.</p><p>At first, Codex CLI didn’t natively support the Figma MCP Server, so it could only access designs indirectly through Playwright MCP or shared screenshots. Despite that limitation, it achieved great results, mostly because the codebase was already well structured, and each React component was built using the correct design tokens, accurately reflecting the Figma original designs.</p><p>However, this changed recently since Figma MCP is now officially supported, allowing Codex CLI to access design data directly.</p><figure><img alt=""Codex CLI and Claude Code side‑by‑side terminals: Visual Studio Code showing two terminal windows side by side: the left terminal runs Codex CLI tasks, while the right terminal runs Claude Code, illustrating that both tools can operate concurrently"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gAzLbOcVr9AkTybifYku9g.png"" /><figcaption><em>Codex CLI and Claude Code running in parallel on separate terminal windows.</em></figcaption></figure><h3>Which one to choose</h3><p>Although Codex provides tools and features similar to Claude Code, I found that each tool excelled in its own domain. Claude Code was better at structuring the project, setting up governance files, automating and defining workflows, while Codex CLI specialized in code refinement, improving readability, accessibility, and performance.</p><p>Both are also accessible through the web or their mobile apps, allowing you to connect to your GitHub repository remotely. They can answer questions about code architecture and implementation, fix bugs, and even start or manage coding tasks while you’re away from your laptop. Once Claude completes its work, you can review the changes, create pull requests directly from the app, and continue working from anywhere.</p><p>From my point of view, together, they formed a balanced collaboration: <strong>Claude Code defined the framework and logic, while Codex CLI perfected the implementation</strong>. This pairing turned my workflow into an iterative design-code cycle that continuously refined itself.</p><h3>From wireframes to prototypes</h3><p>Once code and design share the same foundation, prototypes stop being mere mockups; they become <strong>previews of production</strong>.</p><p>To test this, I decided to put my setup to the ultimate test: <strong>transforming a simple, hand-drawn wireframe into a working prototype with a single prompt</strong>. Both Claude Code and Codex CLI were asked to execute the same task, with the same prompt, wireframe, design tokens, and design system.</p><h4>The setup and wireframe input</h4><p>Both tools communicated with the same design file through Figma MCP Server, where each design component linked to its corresponding code implementation via Code Connect.</p><figure><img alt=""Code Connect snippet (React): A Code Connect panel containing a React code snippet for a Button component. It shows import statements and a &lt;Button&gt; element with props such as label=”Button”, variant=”primary”, size=”medium” and disabled"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bAYpeiYisOSBRJgRIhqvEA.png"" /><figcaption><em>Once connected, the Code Connect snippet for each component surfaced its </em>React source code.</figcaption></figure><p>This connection ensured that both AI agents could pull from the same source of truth, including:</p><ul><li>The design tokens that define colors, typography, and spacing</li><li>The component structure that’s already aligned with the codebase</li><li>The GitHub repository</li></ul><p>For input, I provided a <strong>hand-drawn wireframe</strong> with a few annotations, the sort of sketch I’d usually share to communicate an idea to another designer. I intentionally kept it simple, and a bit imperfect on purpose, focusing on layout and hierarchy instead of visual refinement.</p><figure><img alt=""Hand‑drawn wireframe: A hand‑drawn wireframe sketch of a web page. It depicts a header at the top, a “My Work” section with three rectangular placeholders, a “Contact me” form with fields for full name, email and message, an “Any Questions?” area with checkboxes or dropdowns, and a footer at the bottom"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8u-phWYYF6iMkx2c3RNqtg.png"" /><figcaption><em>The hand-drawn wireframe provided as input to the AI agents (not my proudest sketch!).</em></figcaption></figure><p>The generated page should use only existing components, replicating a real scenario where the prototype reflects production code. As it turns out, both Claude Code and Codex CLI handled this perfectly, using the existing code and confirming that the Code Connect mapping worked as expected.</p><p>Below you can see some of the key components in Storybook:</p><figure><img alt=""Storybook design system (GIF): A recording from inside Storybook showing various components like “Small Accordion.” The interface displays controls for properties like “descriptionText” and “expanded,” along with a description, while the left sidebar lists various components categories such as Buttons, Avatars and Alerts"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*b4KPOxsSgLGu_e4Zd29iCg.gif"" /><figcaption><em>A look inside Storybook, with some of the key components used to generate the prototype. (GIF)</em></figcaption></figure><h4>The single prompt test</h4><p>To keep the comparison fair, I used the exact same prompt for both tools. The only variation was the phrase<em> “Ultrathink this task”</em>, added for Claude Code to activate its deeper reasoning mode. Everything else, from instructions to references, remained identical, ensuring the results reflected each tool’s true capabilities.</p><pre>Ultrathink this task. <br /><br />- I want you to implement the wireframe shown in [Image #5] as a new page <br />called ClaudeWireframeToPrototype, using our existing design system. <br />You must only use our current design tokens and components to recreate <br />this page.<br />- Do not rely on any previously implemented pages as a reference.<br />- You'll notice that the wireframe includes annotations to help you understand <br />the required components and specifications. For any elements that aren't <br />explicitly defined, use your judgment to apply the most appropriate existing <br />components or tokens.<br />- Capitalize all button labels and align their placement according to the <br />wireframe.<br />- Maintain a clear visual hierarchy across all UI elements.<br />- The page must be fully responsive, so make sure to implement responsive <br />breakpoints consistent with our existing patterns.<br />- You need to act as both a Senior Designer and a Senior Front-End Engineer <br />for this task. As a designer, carefully select the correct tokens and <br />components that align with our design system constraints. As an engineer, <br />implement the page using proper composition, semantic HTML, and the defined <br />tokens and components.<br />- Once the implementation is complete, use Playwright MCP tools to verify <br />button positioning, text capitalization, and visual hierarchy consistency. Fix <br />accordingly if any issues arise.</pre><p><strong>The goal wasn’t perfection; it was</strong> <strong>alignment</strong>. I wanted to see whether both agents could translate low-fidelity wireframes into a functional prototype using the right components and tokens.</p><p>Additionally, since these prototypes pull components and instructions directly from the codebase (or the Figma file), the resulting output wouldn’t just resemble production; it would be <strong>production-ready</strong>.</p><h4>Claude Code workflow</h4><p>Claude Code was the first to take on the challenge. I used its <em>ultrathink</em> capability and <em>plan mode</em>, allowing it to thoughtfully execute this task while separating research and planning from code execution.</p><p>Once the implementation was complete, I prompted it to use Playwright MCP Server to get visual context from its implementation and verify that everything was in place. It took approximately <strong>14 minutes</strong> to complete the implementation, resulting in a responsive behavior and proper use of components and design tokens such as typography, colors, etc.</p><figure><img alt=""Claude’s implementation result: Side‑by‑side image comparing the original hand‑drawn wireframe to the page generated by Claude Code. The final page faithfully reproduces the wireframe’s layout with a header, a grid of content cards, a contact form and a questions section, followed by a dark footer"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Wz19fWi3x7mHYejMYW22Zg.png"" /><figcaption><em>A visual of the final result implemented by Claude.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Although the implementation looked great, there was an issue with importing the header component properly on tablet and mobile viewports. However, this got easily fixed with a simple prompt right after.</p><p>There was definitely more room for improvement; however, I only intended to test what the first iteration looks like with no major refinements or changes. For what it’s worth, <strong>it overall managed to pull the right components and use them as expected, delivering a satisfactory result.</strong></p><p>You can watch Claude Code working on this task as I recorded its progress and present it through this video:</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/ba08873025d6b4e7b2e11278b8a1cb97/href"">https://medium.com/media/ba08873025d6b4e7b2e11278b8a1cb97/href</a><h4>Codex CLI workflow</h4><p>Next, I gave Codex CLI the same brief and design input. Codex approached the task a bit differently, being less conversational and more autonomous in its decisions.</p><figure><img alt=""Codex implementation result: Side‑by‑side image comparing the wireframe to the page generated by Codex CLI. The final page resembles the desired layout but adds unexpected category labels and descriptions above each section; the contact form layout differs slightly, and a dark footer appears at the bottom"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uWYR-ZelpF01WYvKKkg20A.png"" /><figcaption><em>A visual of the final result implemented by Codex.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Its process ran for about <strong>20 minutes</strong>, slightly longer than Claude’s execution. The outcome, however, wasn’t ideal. All sections included an unexpected category label above each title and a short description underneath. The contact form layout also deviated from the original wireframe, while the logo wasn’t imported properly, and several issues were spotted on the responsive viewports.</p><p>These were relatively minor issues that could have been easily fixed with a few additional prompts. However, I intentionally chose not to do that, as my goal was to test how both tools would perform under identical conditions using just one prompt. It’s worth noting, though, that in other tests I conducted, Codex produced much stronger visual results and more sophisticated code, particularly in accessibility and structural logic, where Claude occasionally fell short.</p><p>You can watch Codex executing this task in my video below:</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/c67dee28e17e955b25e1919b23a241b5/href"">https://medium.com/media/c67dee28e17e955b25e1919b23a241b5/href</a><h3>Takeaway</h3><p>In this experiment, <strong>Claude Code delivered a stronger overall result</strong>, while Codex took a few initiatives when it shouldn’t have. That was not a deal breaker, but for this single-prompt test, Claude was the clear winner.</p><p>What truly matters, though, is what this workflow unlocks. By combining tools like <strong>Claude Code</strong>, <strong>Codex CLI</strong>, and <strong>Figma MCP Server</strong>, designers can now transform wireframes or Figma designs into interactive, production-ready prototypes.</p><p>This approach accelerates ideation, bridges design and engineering, and enables early feedback from stakeholders or even users on pages powered by real, working code.</p><h3>What’s next</h3><p>From my perspective, the next step is <strong>bringing generated screens back into Figma</strong> in a way smart enough to detect components from code, translate design tokens into variables, and replicate auto-layout behavior directly from implementation. It only feels like the natural evolution of this workflow, and I think we’re getting very close to it.</p><p>Most importantly, this experiment proved that <strong>AI doesn’t replace design; it complements it</strong>. It can safely become part of both the design and production workflow, not by generating random layouts or meaningless code, but by following specific guidelines defined by the designer.</p><p>What becomes really essential is the <strong>design system</strong> itself. Now is the time to invest in them, especially after Figma’s latest <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/schema-2025-design-systems-recap/""><strong>Schema 2025</strong></a> updates, including features like <strong>Extended<em> </em>Collections</strong>, <strong>Slots</strong>, and more.</p><p>At the end of the day, it’s up to each organization to decide how it wants to move forward. Some may prefer quick solutions that generate designs or prototypes detached from any codebase, while others, especially larger teams with established systems and legacy code, will benefit more from connected workflows like this, where AI integrates with existing infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Design systems are now at a defining moment</strong>, proving their value not only to humans but also to machines. Structure will always take time, and it’s not always appreciated since it’s invisible, but it remains a small yet crucial investment toward a much greater opportunity; one where AI aligns with both the designer’s and developer’s intent to produce maintainable code and realistic, production-ready prototypes.</p><h3>Thanks for reading!</h3><p>👋 I’m Iasonas, a Lead Product Designer, currently exploring how better tooling can bring design and development closer together.

Source: Filipe Nzongo (2025)</figcaption></figure><p>Being a designer has always been synonymous with being creative, transforming abstract and complex ideas into concrete solutions. However, in recent years, many professionals have been losing this creative spark, and with it, the very essence of the profession. We’ve witnessed an exponential growth of artificial intelligence tools within the creative industry. This, in itself, isn’t a problem; the real risk lies in becoming dependent on these tools.</p><p>Abandoning your own creative capacity and relying on AI to generate design concepts or evaluate solutions is a mistake that can compromise your professional autonomy and creative confidence.</p><p>In this article, I want to discuss why you shouldn’t rely solely on artificial intelligence tools, but instead focus on building your intellectual foundation as a designer. This foundation develops through both theoretical study and consistent practice in real projects; over time, it becomes the cornerstone of your <a href=""https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-51038-1_36"">repertoire and professional competence</a>.</p><h3>How to build knowledge in design</h3><p>Before discussing knowledge in design, it’s important to first understand what knowledge actually is. According to the dictionary, knowledge is the act of knowing or the state of being aware of something, whether through reason or experience. This definition highlights three central elements that deserve attention:</p><ul><li><strong>Act of knowing:</strong> understanding a phenomenon — knowing what it is, how it works, and why it works in a certain way.</li><li><strong>Through reason:</strong> acquiring knowledge through reflection, study, and theory.</li><li><strong>Through experience:</strong> referring to tacit knowledge, which is built over time through practice and observation of reality.</li></ul><p>When we bring this definition into the field of design, <a href=""https://dl.designresearchsociety.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2267&amp;context=drs-conference-papers"">knowledge in design</a> means mastering the principles, philosophies, methods, and practices that help us to solve problems in a structured and creative way.</p><blockquote>In the context of interaction design or digital product design, the nature of this knowledge is particularly complex. There is no universal list of skills that defines a good designer.</blockquote><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/68e9c90252b3"">André Grilo, Ph.D.</a> (2023), addresses this issue in his <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379221346_Competencias_em_Experiencia_do_Usuario_no_Design_de_Produto_Digital"">doctoral thesis</a> when discussing the competencies of digital product designers. According to Grilo, the field still lacks consensus on which knowledge is essential, precisely because the discipline continues to evolve.</p><p>Even so, companies set expectations, anticipating that designers will perform certain activities and deliver specific results, which is often mistaken for actual professional knowledge.</p><p>This is where we need to be careful: a job description is not synonymous with knowledge. A job description talks about tasks; knowledge concerns the judgment, understanding, and autonomy required to execute those tasks with insight. As Grilo (2023, p.94) points out:</p><blockquote><strong>“There are some epistemological issues in UX Design (UXD) that, in my view, are unavoidable in this theoretical discussion. The first concerns the scope of UX Design, due to its wide range of responsibilities. The second revolves around the relationship of UX with diffuse problems. The third relates to the specificity of User Experience as a construct within the theory of Digital Product Design.”</strong></blockquote><p>Several authors have attempted to define what interaction design and UX are, as well as how the discipline is organized, including Garrett (2001), Saffer (2006), and Six (2010). However, most focus on describing the discipline and its connections with other fields, without clearly specifying the types of knowledge a UX designer must master to excel in their practice.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the famous diagram by <a href=""https://medium.com/u/534e55e898c0"">Dan Saffer</a> (2008). While it is useful for visualizing the intersections and scope of the discipline, the diagram by itself does not reveal anything about the types of knowledge and competencies required for the practice of an interaction designer or a UX designer.</p><figure><img alt=""The image illustrates the disciplines and interdisciplinary connections within UX design"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*lPHCuGVD-NU8jxal.jpg"" /><figcaption>Disciplines and Interdisciplinarity in UX. Source: Dan Saffer (2008)</figcaption></figure><p>It is common for designers to feel confused when it comes to professional competencies and skills. The question often arises: Should I know everything about visual design? human factors or usability engineering? This confusion is natural when there is no clear competency model to guide professional development in the field.</p><p>Sometimes, designers wonder which skills are truly necessary to work as an interaction designer or UX designer. There was a time when mastering tools like Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, and Flash was enough to be considered a competent interaction designer or web designer. That period produced many excellent software operators, but not all of them were truly designers.</p><p>When many of these professionals were questioned about their design decisions, there was often surprise or even responses like: “Why do you want to know how I did it?” There has always been a certain mystery surrounding designers’ decisions. I believe this is, in part, one of the reasons why our relationship with other professionals, such as developers, has historically been complicated.</p><p>Being unable to justify a design decision is as incoherent as hearing a surgeon, when questioned about a decision during surgery, say that they don’t know or cannot explain. Yet, it is still common to find designers who cannot articulate the reasoning behind their actions, a clear sign of a lack of reflection and professional maturity.</p><p>Being a designer goes beyond knowing how to use tools. The new generation needs to be careful not to fall into the same trap, now fueled by the use of artificial intelligence. The risk is producing professionals who master prompt engineering but do not truly understand the problems they are solving.</p><p>Building knowledge in design requires practice, reflection, and purpose. I personally developed my competence by working directly in the discipline, learning from projects, mistakes, and discoveries, rather than relying on tools. A designer needs to know how to do something and, above all, know why they are doing it that way.</p><p>Every design decision needs to be intentional, never vague or accidental. Design is, by nature, an act of choice, and every choice reveals an intention, whether conscious or not. As I discussed in my article <strong>“</strong><a href=""https://brasil.uxdesign.cc/quando-a-intencao-orienta-o-design-3c603728254f""><strong>When intention drives design</strong></a><strong>”</strong>, designing without intention is like navigating without a compass: you may reach somewhere, but it is unlikely to be the right destination.</p><blockquote>Intentionality is what distinguishes the designer as an author from the designer as an operator. The former creates meaning; the latter merely executes commands.</blockquote><p>Therefore, to build knowledge in design, designers need to understand which competencies they need to develop. Theory can be useful for this, helping to cultivate what Schön calls <a href=""https://libguides.hull.ac.uk/reflectivewriting/schon"">reflection-in-action</a>, <a href=""https://libguides.hull.ac.uk/reflectivewriting/schon"">reflection on action</a>, and <a href=""https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1390&amp;context=eandc"">knowledge-in-action.</a></p><p>However, designers must not forget to apply their knowledge in practice, as this is the ground where understanding is validated and transformed. It is through practice that new theories emerge, new solutions are tested, and the designer truly becomes a reflective practitioner and creator of knowledge.</p><h3><strong>Types of knowledge in design</strong></h3><p>The types of knowledge in design vary greatly, depending on the professional’s experience and the context in which they work. For instance, a digital product designer working in the finance sector will have different competencies from someone working in healthcare, dealing with domain-specific challenges, regulations, and user expectations.</p><p>In the finance sector, there are mandatory trainings related to anti-money laundering, as well as regulations from the central bank, that drive the development of financial software, knowledge that a designer in the healthcare sector may not possess or need. Additionally, the design standards and UX practices applied in each sector are also completely distinct.</p><p>If we analyze the <a href=""https://elizabethbacon.com/the-ux-sundial-model-iterated-now-including-a-0/"">UX competencies</a> proposed by Elizabeth Bacon (2009), we notice a generalization that does not always reflect the reality of the designer. What the professional should know to move beyond tool proficiency and build true intellectual and creative depth.</p><figure><img alt=""The image illustrates the field of User Experience (UX)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/0*pUzMClic7_e2daTC.png"" /><figcaption>Field of User Experience. Source: Elizabeth Bacon (2009)</figcaption></figure><p>In the model, disciplines such as information architecture, service design, and interaction design are treated collectively, as if they shared the same set of knowledge. In practice, each of these areas has distinct philosophies, principles, and methods. Evaluating a designer’s knowledge based on such a generalized model can be problematic.</p><p>This reflection reinforces the need for each designer to build their own repertoire and develop critical judgment, adapting their knowledge to the real demands of the context in which they work, rather than relying solely on theoretical models. What will differentiate you from the majority is not following generic standards, but the unique knowledge that only you possess.</p><p>To explore this topic further, I recommend reading my article <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/becoming-good-at-something-619c1a61e924""><strong><em>“Becoming Good at Something”</em>.</strong></a></p><h3>The knowledge development model</h3><p>Considering the complexity involved in defining the types of knowledge a designer should possess, I propose that knowledge development in design should be structured into three levels: <strong>declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge, and reflective knowledge.</strong></p><p>This approach applies regardless of whether the professional works as an interaction designer, service designer, or industrial designer.</p><figure><img alt=""The image illustrates the knowledge model proposed by Filipe Nzongo."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AkNv8j4DyEYLAmw5Yyz9Sg.png"" /><figcaption>Knowledge model. Source: Filipe Nzongo (2025)</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Declarative knowledge (knowing what)</strong></h3><p>Declarative knowledge refers to the factual information an individual possesses, including both general and specific knowledge about their environment. <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43546-022-00402-3"">Ahmet Demir <em>et al.</em> (2022)</a> explain that declarative knowledge relates to an individual’s understanding and intentions, which are crucial for problem-solving and decision-making.</p><blockquote>In other words, declarative knowledge is connected to the process of learning and recalling information that one already knows.</blockquote><p>Wikipedia provides a broader definition:</p><blockquote><strong>“Declarative knowledge is the awareness of facts that can be expressed through declarative sentences. It is also called theoretical knowledge, descriptive knowledge, propositional knowledge, or knowledge-that. It is not restricted to a specific use or purpose and can be stored in books or computers.”</strong></blockquote><p>In my model, I start with declarative knowledge because it establishes the foundation upon which all other learning in design is built. If you want to work as an interaction designer, service designer, or information designer, it is essential to understand the fundamental principles of the discipline, such as typography, visual hierarchy, information architecture, usability heuristics, user-centered design, and so on.</p><p>This type of knowledge is crucial because it enables designers to understand the foundations of their discipline before advancing to specific skills, such as prototyping techniques or the use of generative AI tools. Without this foundation, any practice or decision risks being superficial or disconnected from the critical reasoning necessary to solve complex design problems.</p><p>In declarative knowledge, the focus is on understanding theory. For example, knowing that Jakob Nielsen and Rolf Molich created the 10 usability heuristics in 1990 for evaluating interactive products, or understanding what the <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/two-ux-gulfs-evaluation-execution/"">gulfs of execution and evaluation</a> are and their purpose in interface evaluation.</p><p>Furthermore, declarative knowledge serves as a reference for procedural knowledge (knowing how to perform tasks) and reflective knowledge (understanding why a design decision works or fails). It is the starting point for building repertoire and autonomy: knowing what allows the designer to understand the rules of the game before playing it creatively and strategically.</p><h3><strong>Procedural knowledge (Knowing how)</strong></h3><p>Procedural refers to knowledge that depends on a process, rules, or steps. According to <a href=""https://books.google.no/books/about/The_First_person_Point_of_View.html?id=-s7eoQEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y"">Wolfgang Carl (2014)</a>, procedural knowledge, also called know-how or practical knowledge, is the type of knowledge that manifests in the ability to perform actions effectively, sometimes referred to as imperative or performative knowledge.</p><blockquote><strong>This is the second level of knowledge a designer needs to develop. The model is flexible and can be adapted to any design discipline, serving as a guide to structure learning, practice, and professional development.</strong></blockquote><p>In interaction design or digital product design, this knowledge is reflected in a designer’s ability to carry out concrete tasks, such as conducting a heuristic evaluation, designing user interfaces, prototyping, or organizing navigation flows. In other words, it is not enough to know the theory; one must know how to apply it in practice and demonstrate tangible results.</p><p>There is a fusion between knowing what (declarative knowledge) and knowing how (procedural knowledge), and it is precisely this combination that makes all the difference in a designer’s career. A professional who only masters the theory may understand concepts but will not be able to transform that knowledge into concrete solutions.</p><p>Let’s observe the sketch below, which I created as a simple concept to illustrate the importance of having both declarative and procedural knowledge. When a designer receives a sketch like this from a product manager or design director, they must be able to translate the conceptual idea into a real, functional design.</p><p>However, this transformation requires the designer to have strong declarative knowledge, in other words, a solid grasp of the theory that guides the design process. Being able to translate this sketch into a coherent, consistent, and aesthetically pleasing interface is what separates a professional from an amateur.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows a user interface concept sketch for an e-commerce checkout."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iov5AtXIeY6CeXz8u0KeWQ.png"" /><figcaption>User Interface concept for E-commerce. Source: Filipe Nzongo (2018)</figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, procedural knowledge complements this process by enabling the designer to execute the translation effectively, choosing the right <a href=""https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/grid-layout-design-history-tips-and-best-examples"">visual hierarchy, layout structure</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_design_pattern"">interaction patterns</a>, and <a href=""https://improvement.stanford.edu/resources/usability-principles"">usability principles</a> to bring the concept to life. It’s not only about knowing what should be done, but also how to do it in a way that preserves both functionality and aesthetic integrity.</p><p>In practice, this means understanding how each design decision affects user perception and behavior, for instance, where to place primary actions or how to balance visual weight. These are not random choices; they emerge from a deep understanding of <a href=""https://dovetail.com/product-development/human-computer-interaction/"">HCI principles</a> and accumulated experience through continuous reflection and iteration.</p><p>Ultimately, the ability to move from concept to execution, grounded in both theoretical and practical knowledge, is what defines true design mastery.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows a user interface concept for an e-commerce checkout."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_o7AlwYIRI_V0cgklhWvxw.png"" /><figcaption>User Interface concept for E-commerce. Source: Filipe Nzongo (2018)</figcaption></figure><p>The concept above encapsulates several design principles, such as <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/chunking/"">chunking</a>, where information is divided into clear, logical sections; <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles?srsltid=AfmBOoqWJmStmoUZ-85rWbwVkVpfVIiBBSNFcbYNlrIr0FqiSThc9iOV"">Gestalt principles</a>, where related elements are positioned close to one another; and contrast, achieved through the use of <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/visual-hierarchy-ux-definition/"">visual hierarchy</a> to guide the user’s eye. I also applied alignment to create order and readability, and <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/the-power-of-white-space?srsltid=AfmBOophvmeT4OhmzUA4AXQ7OPiDZioAFQb3h6bbLcgHlm8YZ7vdEiCI"">white space to reduce visual clutter, improve legibility</a>, and allow the eyes to rest during scanning.</p><p>Additionally, the design adheres to good practices from Nielsen’s usability heuristics, such as prioritizing <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/recognition-and-recall/"">recognition over<em> recall</em></a>. For instance, using logos (“FedEx,” “UPS,” “Sedex” etc.) instead of plain text makes it easier for users to recognize and select an option quickly.</p><blockquote>An interface is never just a simple arrangement of elements; it embodies a series of reflections and intentional decisions made by the designer to make it what it is.</blockquote><p>Through this example, I aim to demonstrate that being a designer extends far beyond knowing how to operate tools; it’s about understanding the rationale behind every design decision and the purpose of the proposed solution.</p><h3><strong>Reflective knowledge (Knowing why)</strong></h3><p>Reflective knowledge is the ability to understand why we are approaching a design problem in a certain way. It goes beyond knowing what (declarative) and knowing how (procedural); it involves understanding the reasons behind choices, anticipating consequences, and adjusting decisions based on context and experience.</p><p>Donald Schön calls this <a href=""https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1390&amp;context=eandc"">reflection-in-action</a>, which is real-time thinking during the execution of a task, when the designer observes, adjusts, and decides while acting on the problem. He also describes reflection-on-action, which is the retrospective analysis of what happened after the action, allowing one to learn from experience and improve future design decisions.</p><p>In the design context, professionals are constantly alternating between these two modes of reflection. When testing an interface, for example, a designer immediately evaluates the impact of a change (reflection-in-action) and later revisits the process to understand what worked or didn’t, and why (reflection-on-action).</p><p>This continuous cycle builds repertoire, strengthens critical judgment, and enables designers to make informed decisions without relying exclusively on external tools, such as AI.</p><h3><strong>AI is an ally, not a substitute</strong></h3><p>Artificial Intelligence has become a widely discussed topic among designers. Yet, the question that arises most often is: <strong>Will we be replaced?</strong> It’s still too early to give a definitive answer.</p><p>Although the exponential growth of generative AI worries many designers, it’s important to emphasize that it is an ally, not a replacement for human competence. We still master our craft. This isn’t the first time designers have faced new technologies, and adaptation has always been part of the discipline’s natural evolution.</p><p>When I say AI is an ally, I mean it can be great for accelerating repetitive tasks, organizing information, or generating initial design alternatives — but it doesn’t guarantee creativity or critical judgment.</p><blockquote>A designer’s judgment is grounded in declarative, procedural, and reflective knowledge — the foundation of their professional repertoire.</blockquote><p>This repertoire enables designers to perceive nuances, prioritize problems, and propose appropriate interventions. AI, no matter how advanced, lacks this repertoire: it doesn’t <em>see</em> the interface the way you do, nor does it understand the intention behind your design choices.</p><p>In my article <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-can-humans-and-intelligent-computers-work-together-d349328ce270""><strong>How can humans and computers work together</strong></a>, I discuss how our relationship with intelligent machines should be one of mutual support, not dependence.</p><p>What new-generation designers must be careful about is becoming overly dependent on AI. My appeal to designers is this: let’s not outsource our cognitive capacity. <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/15/1/6"">Research shows that excessive reliance on AI can lead to dependency and a reduction in cognitive ability.</a> Moderation is always essential.</p><p>In the past, when I worked as a graphic designer, even though there were plenty of websites offering graphic bundles and mockups, I made a point of creating my own. For a simple reason: knowing how to make something is better than just using something ready-made. Moreover, creating your own assets helps you stand out; it’s what builds repertoire, practical skills, and professional identity.</p><p>For digital product designers, for example, AI can generate a list of applicable heuristics, but it’s up to you, the designer, to actually evaluate the interface: to identify which heuristics have been violated, which have not been met, and from there, propose solutions to address the interface’s problems.</p><p>Without the kinds of knowledge I described earlier, you won’t be able to spot flaws, let alone suggest improvements, much like trying to judge a case without knowing the laws that govern it.</p><p>Learn to evaluate an interface like a specialist. That’s what allows you to grow as a professional and develop practical, <a href=""https://design-instability.com/tacit-knowledge-and-skills"">tacit knowledge</a>. A designer must be capable of tackling the problem in front of them, not through external tools, but through the knowledge developed over years of study and practice.</p><p>Your intellectual repertoire grows through practice, study, and reflection. Every interface you evaluate, every prototype you test, every design decision you discuss with peers, all of it contributes to building your judgment. This accumulation of experience is what turns information into applicable knowledge, not just data that can be fed into a machine.</p><p>A designer cannot expect AI to do everything for them. They must build their knowledge through study and hands-on experience — collaborating with other professionals, both more and less experienced. Use AI as your creative ally, not your crutch.</p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>To conclude, the message I want to leave for designers is that, in the age of AI, what will truly set you apart in an increasingly competitive market is your intellectual capacity. Building knowledge is more important than mastering tools. New technologies come and go, but knowledge remains. Knowing how to create, thinking critically, and reflecting on your own work are values no one can take away from you.</p><p>What distinguishes an excellent designer from an amateur is not the speed of delivery, but the ability to create projects aligned with both user and business goals, combined with solid technical mastery.</p><p>That’s why you should prioritize building knowledge in design: study, practice, and talk to people who know more than you. Mastering a tool doesn’t make you a designer. Next, learn to identify what you don’t know yet, map your knowledge gaps, and work to fill them with new skills that will drive your professional growth.</p><p>Finally, understand that AI is an ally, not a substitute for human competence. Use it as support, but maintain your ability to think, create, and decide for yourself. Developing creative autonomy is what will ensure you remain relevant, with or without the tools of the moment.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=aaec674d5532"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/hey-designer-do-you-know-what-you-are-doing-aaec674d5532"">Hey designer, do you know what you are doing?</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

It’s as if I’m sitting at the bedside of a dying loved one, dreading the moment they’ll no longer be with us.</p><p>Design isn’t a person, per se, but for many of us it is — or was — a meaningful part of our lives. And the notion that design, as we know it, may wither feels almost certain.</p><p>My main prediction has been that AI will become so ubiquitous and efficient it will absorb nearly every experience that once required traditional design as a mediator.</p><p>This isn’t a doom-and-gloom prediction — it’s a <a href=""https://jakobnielsenphd.substack.com/p/no-more-ui"">rational conclusion</a> drawn from the current trajectory of the industry and what highly respected professionals have also expressed.</p><blockquote>I am becoming more convinced that this [the shift toward users interacting with their agents rather than websites] will mark the end of user interface design as we know it.</blockquote><blockquote>—<a href=""https://jakobnielsenphd.substack.com/p/no-more-ui"">Jakob Nielsen, co-founder of Nielsen Norman Group</a></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, this does not bode well for those just entering the design field. Especially for designers with hopes of creating and building in the same way many of us were once fortunate to be part of.</p><p>However, despite all the negative commentary and predictions surrounding AI, I often witness a naïve optimism among students and junior designers — a kind of defense mechanism that shields them from the harsher realities of the field.</p><p>And maybe that’s exactly why new designers are so vital right now. Their hope is born of ignorance — and I don’t mean that negatively. I mean ignorance in the way that fosters curiosity and openness to possibility. And that’s precisely what the industry needs.</p><p>Maybe people like me are too cynical, too rational, too caught up in how the world works today to see a different path. But if there’s one truth about humans it’s that we’re anything but rational creatures.</p><p>In fact, a disregard for conventional wisdom — especially in young minds — can open a doorway to new ideas.</p><p>They say <a href=""https://www.ideatovalue.com/crea/nickskillicorn/2023/06/evidence-that-children-are-more-creative-than-adults-and-the-opposite/"">children are more creative than adults</a> because they are not tethered by rules and restraints. Even in <a href=""https://updevelopment.org/3-metamorphoses-nietzsches-map-human-growth/"">Nietzsche’s metamorphosis</a>, the final stage of transformation is to a child—representing the ability to experience the world with fresh eyes — unchained by the cultural “thou shalt” directives we’re fed.</p><p>So perhaps there is hope for design, and by extension, designers.</p><p>Perhaps I’m too jaded, too overconfident in believing that if someone like me cannot see the path, then no path exists.</p><p>Maybe instead of thinking it is the end of design, we have faith that those who still dream will pave the way for something new — design that transcends anything we can imagine now.</p><p>It’s time we — I — stop pretending to predict and instead encourage those who will shape a future we want to live in, in ways we have yet to imagine.</p><p>And it begins with humility — with accepting our limitations. And continues with freeing design from the confines of the digital or physical canvas, giving future generations something greater — a cultural canvas, a medium free from the technical restrictions of their forebears.</p><p>Because neither big tech, industry, nor professionals like myself should define the boundaries of creativity and the future of humanity.</p><p><strong><em>Don’t miss out! </em></strong><a href=""https://micbuckcreative.medium.com/subscribe""><strong><em>Join my email list</em></strong></a><strong><em> and receive the latest content.</em></strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9c41a4a51c14"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-future-of-design-rests-on-childlike-ignorance-9c41a4a51c14"">The future of design rests on childlike ignorance</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<p>November starts off like a smoldering poem written in invisible ink, and ends like an action-packed indie film with a rom-com twist and a psychedelic soundtrack. If October was about uncovering what haunts you, November is about <em>what you do with the ashes</em>. Are you going to keep poking around in the ruins, or are you finally going to build the fire pit, roast the marshmallows, and invite your higher self to come hang? <br /><br />The astro-weather this month is intense, deep, philosophical, and yes… messy. But in the best “clarity-through-chaos” kind of way. We kick off the month with Mars shifting into Sagittarius on November 4 after an emotionally consuming six-week stint in Scorpio. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars in Scorpio was laser-focused</a>, obsessive, and operating like a detective with a vendetta, chasing one target at a time with no room for distractions. <br /><br />Now, with Mars in Sagittarius, the energy gets more expansive, scattered, and inspired. But don’t let the hype fool you. This isn’t just a sprint toward “bigger and better.” Jupiter (Sag’s ruler) is retrograde in Cancer, so the compass is internal. Expansion for expansion’s sake is out. <em>Heart-led, intuitive expansion</em> is the only way forward. Every opportunity that knocks this month should be questioned: “Do I want this because it’s shiny? Or because my soul says yes?” </p>



<p>The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 is like a cosmic weighted blanket. It’s earthy, ancestral, and anchored in reality, but still deeply sensual and steeped in beauty. Venus rules this moon, and she’ll be in the final degrees of Libra at the time, which adds a soft, romantic, and artful lens to the emotional intensity. There’s an invitation here to release the need to hustle for worthiness. Let your nervous system downshift. Let pleasure be productive. Let simplicity be sacred. <br /><br />Venus joins the Scorpio party on November 6, the day <em>after</em> the Taurus full moon. So while Mars has left the chat, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio energy is still very much holding court</a>. With the Sun, Venus, and later Mercury retrograde all swimming in Scorpio’s dark, transformational waters, the vibe is: “If I can’t bond with you on a soul level, what are we even doing here?” Expect obsessions, secrets, power plays, and some steamy (and possibly confusing) connections. Intimacy is currency this month — spend it wisely. <br /><br />On November 7, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uranus-retrograde-gemini-taurus-september-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Uranus retrograde</a> shifts into the final degrees of Taurus, where it will complete its seven-year revolution through this sign. This is major. Taurus represents our values, our money, our bodies, our land, and our sense of stability. Uranus represents upheaval, revolution, and awakening. Over the next few months, we’re being asked to reflect: How have your core values changed since 2018? What financial, physical, or emotional risks have actually brought you closer to your truth — and what comfort zones have quietly been killing you? These final Uranian activations are wildcards, but they’re also full-circle. Prepare for the plot twists. </p>



<p>Here comes the real kicker: Mercury retrograde begins November 9 in Sagittarius, just five days after Mars enters the sign. And it’s giving existential crisis with a laugh track. Expect mental overload, spiritual rants, lost documents, misunderstood texts, and big ideas that may not land… just yet. You might say too much, or not enough. But it’s all part of the recalibration. <br /><br />Then on November 18, Mercury retrogrades into Scorpio. Cue déjà vu. Whatever themes came up in October when Mercury was originally in Scorpio? They’re back. But this time, you’re not just collecting receipts — you’re reading them aloud and deciding which ones you want to return <em>and which ones you’re keeping as trophies</em>. Lessons will repeat until integration happens. </p>



<p>As if that wasn’t enough, Jupiter retrograde begins on 11/11 in Cancer. If Mercury retrograde is the mental review, Jupiter retrograde in Cancer is the emotional one. Expect tender feels, nostalgia bombs, family karma flare-ups, and a re-evaluation of what emotional security actually means. Jupiter retrograde in Cancer asks: Have you been caretaking others at the expense of yourself? Or avoiding intimacy under the guise of independence? Either way, this is your cue to grow — not by going “out there,” but by going <em>in here</em>. <br /><br />And then — finally — the clouds begin to part. On November 21 at 8:35pm, the Sun enters Sagittarius. That’s when the heaviness begins to lift. Your inner child wakes up. Your passport starts winking at you. There’s laughter again… the kind that surprises you mid-sentence. Sag season reminds us that we don’t always need a plan; we need a vision. And with Saturn finally stationing direct in Pisces on November 27, some of the lessons and limits we’ve been trudging through since June <em>finally</em> start to make sense. You’ve earned your wisdom stripes. Now you get to dance with them. <br /><br />To wrap it all up, Mercury stations direct on November 29, and Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30. So not only are we clearer, but we’re funnier, flirtier, freer. The month ends with a bang… in the best way. So yeah, the first three weeks of November may feel like crawling through an emotional escape room, but the final stretch? It’s giving spiritual carnival. An open road. And if you play your cards right, you’ll end this month with a deeper trust in your heart, your boundaries, your voice — and your ability to rise. <br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>You’re no stranger to fire, Aries, but this month starts in the deep end of water, and asks if you’re really ready to feel the heat that comes from <em>within</em>. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio Season is activating your sector of shared intimacy</a>, soul ties, and karmic debts. That’s not exactly light-and-breezy terrain. Especially with your ruling planet, Mars, still journeying through Scorpio until November 4, you may find yourself quietly wrestling with themes like: <em>“Who do I trust enough to let all the way in?”</em> or <em>“Why do I keep giving energy to situations that don’t pour back into me?”</em> This is the kind of month where you could meet someone and immediately sense their presence in a past life — or finally have a long-overdue financial or emotional breakthrough around shared resources, inheritances, or entanglements. You’re not being dramatic, you’re being spiritually initiated. There’s a difference. <br /><br />Then comes the Taurus Full Moon on November 5, landing in your money and selfworth zone, and things get <em>very</em> real, <em>very</em> fast. Suddenly the spiritual downloads from Scorpio Season have price tags attached: Are you charging what you’re worth? Are you getting paid fairly? Are you spending in ways that align with your values? With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uranus-retrograde-gemini-taurus-september-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Uranus retrograde in Taurus</a> nearing its final degrees, this full moon might trigger a surprising plot twist with your finances or possessions — a job opportunity that wasn’t on your radar, an unexpected payout (or expense), or a radical new way of thinking about your resources altogether. Think of this as a cosmic audit, not a punishment. The Universe is asking: <em>Do your values and your budget actually match?</em> </p>



<p>From November 4 onward, things get feistier, as Mars enters Sagittarius, your zone of adventure, long-term vision, and personal expansion. Suddenly, all those emotional lessons you’ve been processing don’t feel quite so heavy — they feel like motivation. You might feel a deep pull to book that trip, apply to a course, publish your writing, or finally say the thing you’ve been holding back. But heads up: Mercury will be retrograde in this same part of your chart starting November 9, so while you <em>should</em> dream big and speak freely, double-check all logistics, contracts, and travel details. This retrograde may delay or reroute your plans, but not to block you. It’s to help you clarify your “why.” And once Mercury retrogrades back into Scorpio on November 18, you’ll get one last chance to rewire your mindset around fear, power, and desire before moving forward with more clarity and strength. <br /><br />The month ends on an upward note, as Sagittarius Season begins November 21, and Mercury Retrograde wraps up by November 29. You may feel like a fog is lifting, and suddenly the big picture makes sense again. Venus joins Sagittarius on November 30, sprinkling blessings over your long-term goals, education, and spiritual path. You’re not the same Aries you were at the start of the month; you’re deeper, wiser, and more attuned to what motivates you from the inside out. You didn’t just rise from the ashes. You studied the fire, danced with it, and now you’re ready to use it to light up the next chapter of your life. </p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831459.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>November begins with intensity dripping from every interaction, Taurus. Scorpio Season is lighting up your relationship and one-on-one connection sector, and it’s not here for shallow vibes or lukewarm half-commitments. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">With Mars in Scorpio until November 4</a>, your relationships are your mirror — and they’re showing you everything you need to see, especially the stuff you’d rather avoid. This could be a sexy, soulstirring transit for some Bulls (yes, even the emotionally reserved ones), and for others, it could stir tension, jealousy, or unmet needs that have been bubbling under the surface for months. If you’re single, your standards are getting higher — as they should. If you’re partnered, you’re realizing the partnership needs to evolve if it’s going to last. You want more. And you’re not wrong for that.<br /><br />Then comes the Taurus Full Moon on November 5, your annual cosmic spotlight. It’s been a <em>year</em>, hasn’t it? And yet here you are — softer, stronger, and more self-aware. This moon is ruled by Venus, your planetary ruler, which is finishing her journey through Libra before diving into Scorpio the next day. So this full moon is bittersweet: a celebration of how far you’ve come, and a shedding of all the versions of yourself you no longer need to perform. Since Uranus is retrograde in your sign and now in its final degrees, you may feel a deep urge to <em>finally</em> accept how much you’ve changed in the past seven years in appearance, identity, relationships, and direction. What used to define you might feel like an old costume now. Good. Hang it up. Something new is trying to grow in its place. </p>



<p>By mid-month, things start to shift from emotional excavation to deep embodiment. Venus enters Scorpio on November 6, joining the Sun there, and asking you to love deeper, choose wiser, and stay attuned to your real desires… not just the aesthetic ones. Then Mercury retrograde begins November 9 in Sagittarius, your intimacy and merging zone. This can bring back old lovers, contracts, or money matters tied to shared resources. Don’t be surprised if someone from the past wants to “talk.” But you’re not who you were before. You’ve got receipts. And Mercury’s backspin into Scorpio on the 18th will give you the chance to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2021/07/10567193/toxic-relationships-setting-boundaries"">renegotiate your emotional boundaries</a> if you need to. Be honest, but don’t overexplain. Your energy speaks volumes now. </p>



<p>The last stretch of the month opens the portal to real healing. Sagittarius Season kicks off on November 21, encouraging you to take your time before leaping into the next thing. Your soul is still digesting everything you’ve let go of this fall. Saturn goes direct in Pisces on the 27th, helping you re-establish faith in your friendships and long-term dreams, especially the ones that took a back seat this year. And with Mercury direct on the 29th and Venus entering Sagittarius on the 30th, things that once felt emotionally foggy (money, sex, trust) become clearer. You’ve been through the depths and didn’t flinch. Now, you’re ready to trust your body, your desires, and your evolution — even if it doesn’t look like anyone else’s. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831461.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Let’s be real, Gemini — November might start off feeling like molasses. The Sun is in Scorpio, combined with Mars wrapping up its time in your wellness and routine sector, means you’ve been in <em>fix-it</em> mode: fixing your habits, your mind, your environment, your inbox (or trying). But it’s not just about optimizing your calendar… this energy is calling you to ask: <em>What is my life force actually fueling?</em> Your body is speaking louder now. If you’ve been ignoring rest, boundaries, or hydration (you know better!), this month will make you feel it. Let the first week of November be your reset — your personal rehab for burnout, guilt spirals, and emotional avoidance. This is your permission slip to pause and <em>listen</em>. </p>



<p>The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 hits your spiritual sector like a dream download. If you’re someone who has trouble slowing down, this lunation might knock you into stillness through a dream, a sign, or a gut-level knowing. You’re ending a chapter here — maybe a limiting belief or an outdated loyalty. Venus is still in Libra when this full moon peaks, making it an aesthetic moment too. Surround yourself with music, scent, softness. Then, as Venus enters Scorpio on November 6, the vibe gets deeper, more reflective. Your daily rhythms might get a bit moodier, or you may notice you’re craving more alone time than usual. It’s not isolation, it’s a form of integration, especially with Uranus retrograde in Taurus, hovering at the end of a seven-year subconscious transformation. You’re realizing just how much you’ve been rewiring — even the invisible stuff. </p>



<p>Then things get… interesting. Mercury Retrograde begins in Sagittarius on November 9, in your partnership zone. Oh yes, exes may text. Collaborators from the past may circle back. Current partners may say something that makes you go “Wait, what?” But don’t spiral… this is your cosmic cue to <em>review</em> the terms of your emotional contracts. Mercury re-enters Scorpio on the 18th, bringing the focus back to how your boundaries and emotional labor are being managed. If you’ve been doing <em>too much</em> (classic Gemini when anxious), this is your call to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/natural-detox-how-to-cleanse-your-mind"">delegate, detox, and discern</a>. Don’t be afraid to <em>not reply immediately</em>. Mercury’s got you covered. </p>



<p>The final stretch of November is giving plot twist with a happy ending. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2024-meaning-effects"">Sagittarius Season begins on the 21st</a>, energizing your one-on-one connections and reminding you that vulnerability is not a weakness — it’s an invitation to intimacy. Jupiter retrogrades in Cancer starting 11/11, bringing a money mindset reset, while Saturn shifts direct in your career zone on the 27th, helping you take your creative visions more seriously. By the Venus in Sagittarius shift on the 30th, you’re magnetic again — romantic, radiant, and recharged. You’ve done the shadow work, now get ready to flirt with life like the main character you are. Trust: you can do both depth <em>and</em> levity. That’s your superpower. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831462.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>November begins like a poem with a plot twist, Cancer. Scorpio Season activates your sector of creativity, romance, and joy, but it’s a deep kind of joy, not the fleeting fireworks. It’s the kind that comes from healing your inner child. That’s why this month may bring tender feelings to the surface: unresolved heartaches, old crushes, or forgotten dreams asking for a second chance. Mars is here too, stirring up passion and creative urgency. If you’ve been sitting on an idea, this is your green light to birth it. Just know that Scorpio doesn’t do anything halfway. Whether it’s love, art, or sex, you’re either <em>in</em> or <em>out</em> — no halfway intimacy allowed. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 lights up <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/making-friends-connections-adulthood"">your friendship and community zone</a>, helping you see who’s really in your corner. You may realize that a long-standing connection no longer fits the vision of who you’re becoming, and it’s okay to let go with love. Or maybe you’re finally ready to <em>lead</em> in your community, turning a private passion into a public project. Since this Full Moon is ruled by Venus in late Libra, your home life and family dynamics are also highlighted. Beauty rituals, ancestral wisdom, and long phone calls with your favorite cousin are all medicine. And then — bam — Venus enters Scorpio on the 6th, turning your love life into a gothic novel. Think: slow burns, meaningful glances, psychic intimacy. <em>Someone</em> wants to go deeper with you, but can they meet you where you are? </p>



<p>Here’s where the retrograde fun begins. Mercury Retrograde starts in Sagittarius on November 9, shaking up your daily habits, health routines, and work-life balance. You may lose a file. Miss a meeting. Or get a strong urge to quit something that’s draining your spirit. Take a breath… this isn’t sabotage, it’s realignment. When Mercury slips back into Scorpio on the 18th, you’re being asked to rework a creative idea or reconnect with a lover from the past. Don’t romanticize the rewind, but <em>do</em> be curious. Meanwhile, Jupiter retrograde begins in Cancer (your sign!) on 11/11, making the second half of November a mirror. How have you outgrown your own identity? What would expansion look like if it were rooted in <em>self-love</em>, not performance? <br /><br />Then comes the glow-up. Sagittarius Season starts on the 21st, helping you turn chaos into a system. Your task? Find structure that feels <em>freeing</em>, not confining. Saturn shifts direct in your expansion zone on the 27th, grounding you in your truth, and Mercury stations direct in Scorpio on the 29th, freeing up creative blocks or emotional confusion. Finally, Venus enters Sagittarius on the 30th, helping you find joy in the small things again: making your matcha, editing your playlist, flirting in the grocery aisle. November ends with you feeling more <em>you</em> than you’ve felt in a while — bolder, clearer, and ready to move from survival to sparkle. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831463.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>November’s energy begins in your emotional roots, Leo, as Scorpio Season activates your sector of home, family, and your inner world. With Mars also in Scorpio, you may feel more sensitive than usual, even if you’re trying to keep up your bold and brave front. This isn’t the month to push feelings down. It’s the month to look them in the eye. There may be tension with loved ones or a desire to move, rearrange your space, or finally set boundaries with a roommate or parent. You’re reclaiming your sanctuary — physically and emotionally — and it’s not always graceful work, but it’s soul-deep and necessary. Journaling, therapy, crying in the bath… it all counts as progress this month. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 lights up your career and public recognition zone, and the world is watching. You’ve been working on something behind-thescenes, and this lunation could bring praise, press, or even promotion. But it also asks you to reflect: <em>Am I doing this for legacy, or for applause?</em> Venus is still in Libra that day, softening communication and helping you speak your truth kindly, but clearly. The next day, Venus enters Scorpio, adding more intensity to your private life. Expect deeper conversations, late-night pillow talk, and some potent family revelations. It’s like your inner world becomes the real love story of the month, even if that means finally loving yourself in the places you used to abandon. </p>



<p>Mid-month, the retrogrades start stirring things up. Mercury Retrograde begins in Sagittarius on November 9, in your fun, flirtation, and self-expression zone. If a creative idea stalls or a romantic prospect ghosts, don’t panic. Rethink your approach. Ask yourself where the spark went — maybe it’s you that needs rest, not the idea or the lover. When Mercury re-enters Scorpio on November 18, you’re brought back to unresolved emotions at home or with family. A childhood memory may resurface. Or an old version of yourself might be grieving what you’ve outgrown. Don’t rush through the tenderness. Meanwhile, Jupiter Retrograde in Cancer begins on 11/11, lighting up your spiritual zone. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/recurring-dreams-meaning"">Your dreams may be extra vivid</a>. Your ancestors extra loud. Listen. <br /><br />And then: lift off. Sagittarius Season begins on November 21, and you start to feel like <em>you</em> again. Not the Leo who has to hold it all together, but the one who laughs loud, kisses like fire, and shines unapologetically. Saturn shifts direct in your intimacy sector on November 27, helping you better understand what commitment actually means for you — and what’s worth saying yes to. Mercury shifts direct in Scorpio on the 29th, bringing emotional clarity at last. Then Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30, and romance, creativity, and confidence start bubbling again. November ends with your heart wide open — wiser, softer, and still burning bright. </p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831464.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The beginning of November pulls you inward, Virgo. Scorpio Season is activating your communication and inner dialogue sector, and with Mars also in Scorpio, your mind is a hotbed of activity. You might feel more argumentative than usual, or more quick to defend your ideas. But instead of getting stuck in loops or overexplaining, take a beat: <em>Who are you really trying to convince?</em> Others… or yourself? The truth is, this month wants to help you refine your inner voice — to trust it, but also challenge it when it’s stuck in outdated loops. Therapy, journaling, or even audio notes to yourself could be surprisingly clarifying. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 activates your expansion sector, which is all about publishing, travel, and higher learning. Something you’ve been studying, writing, or dreaming about may finally come full circle, and you’ll be asked: <em>Do you still want this?</em> Venus in Libra that day helps you align your values before making any big declarations. But the very next day, Venus enters Scorpio, and suddenly, everything feels more emotionally charged. Your words can cut — or heal — depending on how you wield them. Old conversations may come back for review later in the month when Mercury Retrograde (starting Nov 9 in Sagittarius) retraces its steps, first in your home and emotional sector, then eventually back into Scorpio on November 18. </p>



<p>And yes, Mercury Retrograde in Sagittarius may stir up home drama or nostalgia. You might reconnect with a sibling, parent, or even an old roommate. Or you could find yourself rethinking where you want to live and what kind of foundation you’re building your future on. The Jupiter Retrograde in Cancer starting 11/11 adds an emotional edge to your friendships and long-term dreams. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mid-distance-relationships"">Some relationships might feel distant</a>. But that distance is showing you who truly sees you — and who’s just there for convenience. Not everything that’s consistent is actually nourishing. <br /><br />Then comes relief. Sagittarius Season begins on November 21, and the Sun lights up your foundation, helping you feel more secure and centered. Saturn shifts direct in your relationship sector on November 27, bringing clarity around boundaries and long-term commitment. Mercury shifts direct in Scorpio on the 29th, restoring flow to your conversations and mindset. And to wrap it all up, Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30, helping you beautify your home and maybe even plan a cozy holiday gathering. You’re leaving November with a clearer head, a softer heart, and a deeper understanding of what home <em>really</em> means — inside and out.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831465.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>November wants to talk about your worth, Libra. And not just in terms of money — though Scorpio Season and Mars in Scorpio are definitely heating up your financial sector. This is bigger. It’s about your value system, your sense of self-worth, and how those two things intersect. You’re being asked: <em>Are you charging enough for your gifts? Are you pouring your energy into people who match your frequency?</em> The month starts off intense, especially if you’ve been overextending yourself in order to be liked. No more. You’re recalibrating. Even if that means pulling back. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 lights up your intimacy and merging sector, bringing some financial, sexual, or emotional entanglements to a head. Something’s gotta give. It could be a final bill, a revelation in therapy, or a sexual connection that either deepens or ends. Venus is still in Libra that day, helping you move with grace and charm. But on the 6th, Venus enters Scorpio, and your vibe gets much more private. Suddenly, you’re craving quality over quantity in love, in money, in everything. </p>



<p>It’s giving: “If it doesn’t feel sacred, I don’t want it.” Honor that. Mercury Retrograde begins in Sagittarius on November 9, in your communication zone. So watch what you say and how you say it, and also how you <em>hear</em> others. Miscommunications could spark easily, especially in text or over email. When Mercury retrogrades back into Scorpio on November 18, y<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/low-self-esteem-spending-money"">our money and self-worth come back into focus</a>. If you’re negotiating rates, contracts, or even just trying to figure out your holiday budget, take your time. This retrograde is your chance to revise, not rush. Add in Jupiter Retrograde in Cancer starting on 11/11 — lighting up your career sector — and it’s clear: November is all about long-term alignment, not quick wins.<br /><br />By Sagittarius Season (Nov 21), your voice gets stronger again. You’ll feel like sharing more, laughing more, connecting more. Saturn shifts direct in your daily routine sector on November 27, helping you get back on track with health, organization, or wellness habits that may have fallen off. Mercury shifts direct on the 29th, clearing mental fog. And on November 30, Venus enters Sagittarius, and you’re back in your social butterfly flow — radiant, expressive, and ready to flirt again. You end the month remembering who you are: an artist, a lover, a light. Don’t forget what you’re worth. </p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You are <em>the</em> moment, Scorpio, but you already knew that. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio Season keeps going strong through November 21</a>, and with Mercury also spending time in your sign from November 18th to December 11th, your energy is magnetically focused, deliciously intense, and hard to ignore. You’re in transformation mode, and the world can feel like it’s rotating around your evolution. You’ve likely been tunnel-visioned lately, obsessed with a particular outcome, person, or path. But as Mars shifts into Sagittarius on November 4, it’s time to loosen your grip. The work you’ve done to go deep now wants to expand. But not just anywhere… your soul knows exactly where. <br /><br />Right after Mars exits your sign, the Taurus Full Moon on November 5 illuminates your relationship sector, bringing closure or clarity in love. Someone may surprise you with their emotional maturity, or their lack of it. You’re seeing clearly now. Venus is in her final degrees of Libra that day, moving through your soul and secrets sector, helping you end a chapter with grace. But once Venus enters Scorpio on November 6, you’re magnetic as hell. People are watching you like art. You’re watching them like a hawk. Your beauty is sharper, your desires louder. Love, sex, and money all take on deeper significance, but beware of projecting old wounds onto new people. </p>



<p>The middle of the month gets tricky, though. Mercury Retrograde begins in Sagittarius on November 9, clouding your money mindset and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-confidence-code-a-reminder-that-you-are-worthy"">self-worth sector</a>. Double check receipts, revisit pricing, and be gentle with self-talk. Then on November 18, Mercury dips back into Scorpio, and boom — you’re reviewing your own words, your own intentions. Something you said or decided last month may need to be reworked. Don’t panic. This is a cosmic do-over. Meanwhile, Jupiter Retrograde begins in Cancer on 11/11, activating your publishing, travel, and belief system sector. You may postpone a trip or start questioning your bigger life plans. Let the questions come… They’re clues. <br /><br />And then? Big breakthrough. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2024-meaning-effects"">Sagittarius Season begins on November 21</a>, and with it comes the shift from intense introspection to grounded action. You’re focused on your finances, your value, your legacy. Saturn shifts direct in Pisces on November 27, in your creativity and romance sector, helping you solidify a passion project or commit more seriously in love. Mercury shifts direct in your sign on November 29, unblocking your voice and clarity. And finally, Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30, reminding you that abundance is your birthright, but only when you believe you’re worthy of it. You’ll end the month sharper, sexier, and more self-aware than you began. Phoenix status: reactivated. </p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The month starts in the cocoon, Sag, but it doesn’t stay there for long. With the Sun in Scorpio through November 21, your sector of rest, release, and dreams is activated, nudging you to slow down before your season begins. This is your yearly invitation to clean house spiritually and emotionally. Mars enters Sagittarius on November 4, launching a six-week period of accelerated movement, confidence, and main-character energy. The tension between the two — wanting to retreat and also being pushed into the spotlight — can be confusing at first. But here’s the thing: just because Mars is in your sign doesn’t mean you have to rush. Move with clarity, not chaos. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 lights up your wellness and work sector, helping you re-evaluate your daily habits and rituals. If you’ve been <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/signs-of-anxiety-and-depression-symptoms"">neglecting your body</a> or overextending yourself with work, this lunation is your wake-up call. With Venus at the final degrees of Libra the same day, friendships may play a surprising role in helping you ground yourself. Then Venus enters Scorpio on November 6, stirring hidden feelings. Someone you thought you were over may resurface in your dreams, your inbox, or your heart. This Venus transit moves through your solitude zone, so you might be more sensitive to energetic shifts; don’t dismiss your intuition. </p>



<p>The middle of the month gets hazy. Mercury Retrograde begins in your sign on November 9, making you rethink everything from how you show up online to what you <em>really</em> believe in. If you’re working on a pitch, post, or big reveal, delay it until next month if possible. Jupiter Retrograde in Cancer begins on 11/11, activating your intimacy and soul-merging sector. Emotional boundaries may blur, but this is also a chance to heal old wounds around trust. By November 18, Mercury retrogrades into Scorpio, pushing you back into reflection. Whatever came up during Scorpio Season needs a final purge, so make space. <br /><br />Then your solar rebirth season begins — finally! Sagittarius Season starts on November 21 at 8:35 PM EST, and the shift will feel like a deep exhale. You’re back, baby. The Sun in your sign brings vitality, clarity, and the courage to dream again. Saturn goes direct in Pisces on November 27, stabilizing your home and emotional foundations. If you’ve been navigating family tension or housing uncertainty, things start to feel more solid. Mercury ends its retrograde in Scorpio on November 29, giving you a clearer sense of what to say, or <em>not</em> say. And on November 30, Venus enters Sagittarius, gifting you with charm, beauty, and cosmic flirtation. You’re ending the month glowing, expansive, and ready for your next adventure. </p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the first three weeks of November remind you that even the most selfsufficient mountain goat needs community. Scorpio Season activates your sector of friendships, social networks, and long-term dreams. You may find yourself orbiting new circles, or reevaluating the people who get to be in your orbit at all. Mars enters Sagittarius on November 4, stirring up your sector of closure and healing. This is a sixweek invitation to burn away what no longer resonates with you, especially habits or mindsets you’ve outgrown. With Mars behind the scenes, not everything needs to be public. Power moves can still be made in silence. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 turns your attention to your sector of romance, creativity, and pleasure. You deserve to feel good in your body, and this lunation reminds you of that. Whether you’re deepening a current connection or expressing yourself through your art, something you’ve been nurturing is ready to blossom. With Venus finishing its journey through Libra that day (your career zone), a professional payoff may also arrive — recognition, a collaboration, or a glow-up that reminds you you’ve still got it. But the next day, Venus enters Scorpio, so expect your social life to become deeper, more emotionally layered, and maybe a little more intense. </p>



<p>The middle of the month asks for patience. Mercury Retrograde begins in Sagittarius on November 9, then moves into Scorpio on November 18. Conversations, contracts, or collaborations <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-is-deja-vu-meaning"">may feel like déjà vu</a>. You might revisit an old dream, a past friendship, or a vision for the future that you shelved. Don’t rush to act… just listen. Jupiter Retrograde begins in Cancer on November 11, calling for reflection in your relationship dynamics. Ask yourself: are your partnerships truly reciprocal? Are you overgiving? Or perhaps being too guarded? You don’t have to fix it all this month,. but consistent self-awareness is step one. <br /><br />Sagittarius Season begins on November 21, and it’s your time to slow down before your own season begins. Think of this last stretch of the year as your cosmic hibernation: rest, review, and reconnect with your inner compass. Saturn, your ruling planet, ends its retrograde in Pisces on November 27, making communication, writing, and mental clarity much smoother. You’ll start to feel like your words hold more weight… and they do. Then Mercury shifts direct on November 29, and Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30, softening your inner world and giving you the grace to forgive yourself for how long healing has taken. You’re in deep preparation mode. By next month, you’ll be ready to rise. </p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You’re a visionary, Aquarius, but even visionaries hit fog. Scorpio Season rules your sector of legacy and career, so the first three weeks of November are deeply focused on your purpose. But it’s not just about what you do, it’s about <em>why</em> you’re doing it. Mars’ entrance in Sagittarius on November 4 ignites your sector of community, collaboration, the future. Suddenly, people are reaching out, ideas are flowing, and projects with purpose start calling your name. You’re not just chasing the bag this month — you’re chasing the vision that aligns with your soul’s mission. Still, with Uranus (one of your planetary rulers) retrograding in Taurus, your home, family, or sense of inner stability might feel shaky. Breathe through it. You’re building a new foundation. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 lights up your domestic sector and your emotional center. Something you’ve been suppressing about your past, your upbringing, or even your living situation may come up for release. This is a heart-check moon, one that reminds you to nurture your inner world before building the outer one. And just when you think you’re getting grounded, Venus enters Scorpio on November 6, intensifying your desire for power moves and recognition. Yes, you’re deeply magnetic, but protect your peace. </p>



<p>Mercury Retrograde begins in Sagittarius on November 9, then moves into Scorpio on the 18th. This combo could feel like you’re reworking both your dreams <em>and</em> your professional direction. An old project may return, or a past ambition reawakens. Take notes, but don’t rush. Meanwhile, Jupiter Retrograde in Cancer starts on 11/11 (an ascension portal day!) And nudges you to reconfigure your routines and health habits. Are you doing what actually sustains you, or just what looks good on paper? <br /><br />By the time Sagittarius Season starts on November 21, life gets a bit lighter, more adventurous, and hilarious in that Sag way. The final 10 days of the month bring major energetic shifts: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/saturn-retrograde-in-aries-and-pisces-horoscope-july-2025-meaning-effects"">Saturn ends its retrograde in Pisces on November 27</a>, helping you finally implement new financial or self-worth boundaries. Then Mercury shifts direct on November 29, and Venus enters Sagittarius on the 30th, helping you align with the friendships and collabs that uplift your spirit. You’re not here to follow trends, Aquarius — you’re here to shape the future. So stay weird and stay wise. You’re closer than ever. </p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, November opens with a whisper from your higher self: “You’re evolving.” Scorpio Season rules your sector of wisdom, expansion, and travel, and these first three weeks may feel like a spiritual initiation. Maybe you’re craving distance, space, or perspective. Maybe you’re being pushed to outgrow a belief, a path, or a relationship you once thought was forever. Mars enters Sagittarius on November 4, activating your sector of career, and just like that, the stakes feel higher. You’re climbing a new mountain, Pisces. The next six weeks want you to lead, to be seen, to step into the role you’ve quietly been preparing for. <br /><br />But slow your roll… the Taurus Full Moon on November 5 hits your sector of communication, teaching, and truth. A conversation, message, or idea lands deeply. You could launch something, publish something, or even receive news that shifts your course. With Venus finishing its journey through Libra, your intimacy and financial dynamics reach a point of clarity, and then Venus dives into Scorpio on November 6, bringing <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-finances-transparency-relationship"">emotional transparency into your relationships</a>. Say what you feel, even if your voice trembles. Say what you want, even if you’re not sure how it’ll be received. </p>



<p>The middle of the month is retrograde heavy: Mercury Retrograde in Sagittarius begins November 9 and then Scorpio (Nov 18) may slow career launches or travel plans. You might question the direction you’re heading — don’t panic. That’s part of the process. Then Jupiter Retrograde begins in your fifth house of love, creativity, and joy on November 11, nudging you to reconnect with what lights you up from the inside out. Have you been making space for beauty? For your art? For romantic playfulness? Don’t wait until you burn out… nourish yourself and tend to your needs now.<br /><br />Sagittarius Season starts November 21, and with your career in the spotlight, the pressure may rise, but so does your ambition. Then on the 27th, Saturn shifts direct in your sign after months of restructuring your identity and path. You may feel more grounded in who you are and what you offer. Mercury ends its retrograde in Scorpio on the 29th, and Venus enters Sagittarius on the 30th, ending the month with a boost of charm and cosmic green lights. November ends on a high note: expansive, exhilarating, and a little chaotic in a good way. You’ve done the inner work, Pisces. Now let the world catch up to your brilliance. </p>

Mamacita has many meanings. Literally, it translates to “little mother,” but colloquially it can describe an attractive woman or serve as a sweet nickname for someone dear. For Miami-based fashion label <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcarolinak.com%2Fcollections%2Fmamacita-collection%2Fproducts%2Felsa-cardigan&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fcarolina-k-helena-christensen-mamacita"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Carolina K</a> and model <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/helena-christensen-proves-shes"">Helena Christensen</a>, the name of their newly launched line captures all those nuances — strength, sensuality, and affection — while also honoring the Andean elders who hand-knit each piece.<br /><br />Launched on October 24, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcarolinak.com%2Fcollections%2Fmamacita-collection&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fcarolina-k-helena-christensen-mamacita"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mamacita</a> draws inspiration from both Carolina Kleinman, the Bolivian-Argentine designer who founded Carolina K in 2005, and Christensen, the Peruvian-Danish supermodel, as well as from the South American mothers who shaped them. In fact, the collaboration became a deeply personal creative journey when Christensen returned to her mother’s hometown of Lima, Peru, after decades away. She brought her mother, Elsa, along, and together they reconnected with family while visiting historic neighborhoods and art galleries from their past.<br /><br />“We were in my hotel room looking at all the pieces, and we were all just expressing how important it felt. For them, it was a personal trip, and I got to be part of that,” Kleinman tells Refinery29 Somos.<br /><br />Timed to the 20th anniversary of the Carolina K brand, Mamacita represents both a creative milestone and a heartfelt tribute to the communities that have inspired Kleinman’s vision from the start. For nearly two decades — long before <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/can-fashion-be-sustainable"">sustainability became a buzzword</a> — Kleinman has championed ethical fashion through handcrafted pieces that celebrate ancestral techniques and empower the artisans who keep them alive. Working with makers in remote regions of Mexico, Peru, and India, her brand continues to honor cultural traditions while protecting the planet.<br /><br />“We are not about inventing something new every season. Instead, we want to give what we make a longer life. The more timeless we get to do things, the better it is for everyone,” Kleinman says. “Some things are just classic. And we wanted to create a brand that was classic and meaningful.”<br /><br />From limited-edition hand-embroidered garments and Peruvian-made knitwear to design details inspired by the Andes and the ocean, the collection embodies a timeless elegance.<br /><br />As Kleinman explains, the capsule includes pieces “for every occasion.” In the lookbook, Christensen models the collection in moments that span her life’s journey: dipping into the ocean, walking through the Lima neighborhood of Barranco, attending a dinner party, and wandering the cool mountains. “There’s a look for every moment in our lives, because it represents different women. There’s not one prototype of a woman.”<br /><br />Swipe through to discover some of our favorite pieces from the Mamacita collection.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

<p>The holidays have arrived early at Sephora, and by that, we mean that the retailer’s highly anticipated savings event is back for 2025. Whether you’re eyeing the bevy of sparkly gift sets or looking to repurchase your favorite <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nocturnal-polar-night-serum-review"">luxe serum</a>, Sephora’s <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/beauty/savings-event"">Holiday Savings Event</a> is the time to do just that.</p>



<p>Anyone who’s shopped Sephora’s sales before knows the rules, but if you’re new here, this is the run-down: Depending on your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/05/9843677/sephora-beauty-insider-cash-rewards-program-update-2020"">Beauty Insider membership tier</a> (which goes from Insider, VIB, and Rouge, depending on how much you spend annually), you can get <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/beauty/savings-event"">10, 15, or 20% off</a>, respectively. Rouge members can start shopping on Friday, October 31 (Happy Halloween!), and both VIBs and Insiders get the green light on November 4. <em>All</em> tiers have until November 10 to use the promo code <strong>EVERYTHING</strong> at checkout, which automatically applies the discount according to your membership tier. (Regardless of tier, all Beauty Insider levels can take 30% off all Sephora Collection products from October 31 to November 10, no code needed.) </p>



<p>As with previous years, there’s some fine print to keep in mind as you plan your Sephora haul: Shoppers are limited to two Dyson items (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dyson-hairstyling-tools-worth-it-review"">choose wisely</a>), three <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-flexfusion-styler-review"">Shark Beauty</a> items, three The Ordinary products, and three Nutrafol items per transaction. MAC Cosmetics VIVA GLAM products, in-store services, previous purchases, and gift cards are also not eligible for a discount. But, a <em>major</em> perk of Sephora’s holiday savings event: Snapping up gift sets at a discount.</p>



<p>Now that you have the rules of the road, onto the fun part: Keep scrolling for the most worth-it items to snag during the sale.</p>

<p>If you love niche, luxury fragrance, here’s a name you’ve probably never heard of — for now. From the brains of Melanie Bender (whose resume includes executive roles at Rhode, Versed, and Merit) and Joe Cloyes and Greg Gonzalez (founders of Youth To The People) comes Lore. The collection of four hyper-sensorial, unique fragrances ranges from fruity with a hint of smoky mezcal (Disfruta, seen here) to <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/lovely-a-little-twisted-eau-de-parfum-P517242?skuId=2888469&amp;icid2=products%20grid:p517242:product"">Lovely And A Little Twisted</a>, a milky rose that’s utterly addictive. Best of all: They all clock in at $88 for a full-size bottle — easily half of comparable designer brands — and are fair game during the sale. </p>

<p>There is stiff competition in the world of tinted lip butters, balms, and treatments — but the Summer Fridays one continues to stand out from its competition time and time again. This cozy set includes two holiday-exclusive flavors (Toasted Marshmallow and Hot Cocoa) alongside a travel-size Jet Lag Mask for skin-quenching hydration.</p>

<p>Patrick Starrr’s ONE/SIZE setting spray is goated for a reason: Nothing works better to lock in makeup all day long with a soft matte finish. This holiday set is only $2 more than the full-size, but includes a mini for those all-important touchups. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939826.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p><em>Warning: This story contains graphic details of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2019/10/8643443/15-signs-of-domestic-violence-that-arent-physical"">domestic violence</a>.  </em></p>



<p>I will never forget the night that finally made me leave. My ex-partner and I were at an event with friends. Everything seemed fine until he — as he often did — switched from affectionate to enraged without warning. Throughout the night, he sent me cryptic texts: <em>“I’m watching you. You’ll see what happens when we get home.”</em></p>



<p>The venue was dark and crowded, which allowed him to hide in the shadows. When he finally appeared, I was already in tears. I told him I was done. He grabbed me so tightly I could barely breathe, whispering, “You’ll never leave me.” When I tried to escape, he threw me to the ground and began kicking me—my face, my stomach, my back. I remember praying, <em>“God, please help me get through this.”</em> A friend eventually pulled him off me, and another rushed me outside.</p>



<p>That night, I ran to my sister’s apartment. My best friend joined us, and together they convinced me to call my mother. I didn’t want to; I had been hiding so much from my family, and I knew calling meant going to the hospital and filing a report. I also feared what my ex had always threatened: <em>“If you send me to jail, I’ll kill myself.”</em></p>



<p>When my mom saw my bruised face over FaceTime, she broke down. At the hospital, I was surrounded by police officers and doctors, forced to retell the story again and again. Even then, I tried to protect him—until I learned he and his mother lied to the police, saying I’d fallen down stairs. That betrayal broke something in me. I told the truth. I filed for a restraining order, terrified but determined to protect myself.</p>



<p>When I met him, I was in a vulnerable place and searching for love, something I think now that he sensed. The control and manipulation started subtly—name-calling, jealousy, isolation. I was shocked, yes, but I took it because I convinced myself that he loved me. Then the emotional abuse became physical. I was constantly walking on eggshells, terrified of his next outburst. He would punch walls, throw objects, and then apologize, promising he’d never hurt me again. Like so many survivors, I stayed, believing he could change. I was in a constant state of hope—hope that the man I first met would return, hope that things would go back to “normal.” However, the truth is that there was never anything normal about it.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Domestic violence is not simply isolated or personal; it’s cultural, systemic, and global. It crosses every boundary: race, class, gender, and age.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The abuse only escalated from there. Over time, I became someone I didn’t recognize—isolated, anxious, and ashamed. He would push me against walls, crack drywall, and then threaten to harm himself to pull me back in. I remember breaking down locked doors to stop him from self-harming. Every time I thought of leaving, he’d promise to change—or promise to die.</p>



<p>After that final night, something inside me broke open. I started therapy and eventually found <a href=""https://www.safehorizon.org/"">Safe Horizon</a> through friends and family who told me about the work they do. It was the first time I felt truly ready to speak out.</p>



<p>I learned that my story was not unique, and that’s what makes it so devastating. Domestic violence is not simply isolated or personal; it’s cultural, systemic, and global. It crosses every boundary: race, class, gender, and age. The tactics abusers use are eerily similar: isolation, intimidation, emotional manipulation, and control.</p>







<p>Safe Horizon, the largest victim service nonprofit in the U.S., provides critical resources for survivors of abuse and violent crime. What drew me to them was their inclusive approach—they support survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, sex trafficking, and more. Their <a href=""https://www.safehorizon.org/streetwork/"">Streetwork Project</a> helps young people experiencing homelessness due to abuse, offering food, shelter, medical care, and compassion without judgment. They reach survivors wherever they are, meeting them with dignity and safety.</p>



<p>Too often, young women—especially Black women—don’t feel safe seeking help. We’re told to stay quiet, that no one will believe us, that leaving is pointless. And the question survivors hear most—<em>“Why didn’t you just leave?”</em>—is one of the most harmful. As FKA Twigs bravely shared when <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/arts/music/fka-twigs-shia-labeouf-abuse.html"">speaking about her own experience</a>, that question blames the survivor instead of the perpetrator. Leaving isn’t simple—it’s dangerous. It’s layered with fear, shame, financial dependency, and psychological manipulation. Even after leaving, survivors face systemic challenges: renewing restraining orders, reliving trauma in court, and constantly looking over our shoulders.</p>



<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=5wSrVmPeQSA"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Through Safe Horizon</a>, I found healing, advocacy, and community. The <a href=""https://www.safehorizon.org/about-us/leadership/senior-leadership/"">organization’s leaders</a> like Lisa A. O’Connor and Liz Roberts, create true safety by approaching survivors with empathy, patience, and emotional intelligence. Even small gestures—asking <em>“Do you welcome hugs?”</em>—remind survivors that we have autonomy again.</p>



<p>One of the most profound parts of my healing has been realizing that survival doesn’t mean the pain disappears. It means transforming it. As <a href=""https://grief.com/"">author and grief expert David Kessler wrote</a>, I learned to turn my “pain into purpose”. I use my voice now to help others recognize the signs of abuse before it’s too late. Love should never make you smaller. Real love doesn’t silence, it protects and uplifts.</p>

<p>Calling all fashion lovers because the nineties… and seventies… and sixties called, and they want to be back inside your closets. Luckily, New York-based fashion designer <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/05/11377960/anna-sui-career-collaborations-designers"">Anna Sui</a> was tapped by <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/old-navy-the-occasion-dresses"">Old Navy</a> for its <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/now-trending/anna-sui?cid=3050175&amp;bc=true"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">first-ever designer collaboration</a> — fronted by Y2K-coded singer-songwriter PinkPantheress.<br /><br />“Anna really understands who our customer is, what she wants, how she lives, and we knew this was an amazing moment to bring that,” <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-studio-collection-01-zac-posen"">Zac Posen</a>, creative director of Gap Inc. and chief creative officer of Old Navy, tells Refinery29. “Anna is a design and style icon, and I thought to bring that to another nineties icon, Old Navy, made perfect sense to launch this.” <br /><br />Known for “her whimsy, her magic, her cool, and her rock ‘n’ roll energy,” in the words of Posen, Sui’s <em>Almost Famous</em> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/09/10008469/penny-lane-costumes-almost-famous-kate-hudson-fashion-looks"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Penny Lane</a>-meets-witchy Stevie Nicks aesthetic is on full display with this “Bohemian collection.” Think: <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864620002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175#pdp-page-content"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">faux fur Afghan coats</a> (aka Penny Lane coats), lace cardigans, floral dusters, and <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864614002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175#pdp-page-content"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">satin slip skirts</a> (one of Sui’s favorite styles),<br /><br />But we’re not just swooning over the styles… we’re also thrilled about the prices. “There’s a lot of Anna Sui DNA incorporated into this collection, but made with the expertise of Old Navy, and into very accessible, affordable pieces,” Sui tells Refinery29 about the collection, which ranges between a $10 <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864653002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175#pdp-page-content"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">floral headscarf</a> and $120 <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864630002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">vegan suede coat</a>.</p>

<p>My natural nails and I have been on a journey. I was a chronic nail-biter for the majority of my childhood, and even as I went through college and my 20s, I constantly experienced dry, brittle nails that would break as soon as they grew past my fingertips. And while yes, I loved my Après extensions and builder gel manis to encourage growth, the truth is, these services are pricey and time-consuming. My inner monologue, screaming in QVC, knew there had to be a better way.</p>



<p>Enter from stage left, DIY nail bestie Olive &amp; June. The Los Angeles-based nail salon turned <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/regular-nail-polish-vs-gel-manicure-benefits"">polish purveyor</a> has perfected the art of the home manicure, even launching <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/olive-june-gel-system-review"">its own gel system</a> earlier this year. Taking things a step further, Olive &amp; June is unveiling its own <a href=""https://oliveandjune.com/pages/builder-gel"">Builder Gel collection</a> — and honestly, I might never set foot in a nail salon again. (I’m exaggerating, of course — support and <em>tip</em> your manicurists!) </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939495.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=734&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A367"" /></figure>



<p>“Because gel had done so well, but we knew people were like, ‘How do I get stronger, longer nails that are mine? How do I get nail extensions that I can build without a tip?'” Olive &amp; June founder and CEO Sarah Gibson Tuttle tells Refinery29. “[Our community] loves press-ons, but they wanted gel almost to work harder for them.” Designed to work seamlessly with the brand’s existing Gel Mani System (which includes a proprietary lamp, base, and top coats), Builder Gel comes in 15 sheer, milky neutrals inspired by Olive &amp; June fan favorites, and allows the user to achieve the plump, durable look and feel of salon builder gel, or craft gel extensions at home using patent-pending forms. “We want to give you the ability to either have instant extensions or grow your nails over time, and also with the color that you want,” explains Gibson Tuttle. As with salon builder gel, Olive &amp; June’s formula is a thicker consistency (compared to its regular gel polish), which allows you to manipulate the shape and get extra rise and plumpness. (Don’t worry, the brand includes a liner brush in the kit.)</p>



<p>For my second builder gel mani, Olive &amp; June graciously set me up with an appointment with manicurist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dreamer_nails/"">Julieta Martinez</a>. Martinez walked me through the steps of using the Olive &amp; June nail forms, which come in three sizes to fit your finger and create a customized extension. (If you’ve never tried nail forms before, they work by wrapping around your finger and painting on the builder gel in your desired length and shape.)</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939643.jpg?width=773&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=773%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>As much as I’d love to be a press-on girlie, I can never seem to have them stay on for more than a few hours. Builder gel extensions get me the length I love, without any glue or tips. (They also feel lighter on my fingertips than press-ons or acrylics.) For my extensions, I went with <a href=""https://oliveandjune.com/collections/gel-builder-polish/products/rose-glaze-builder-gel"">Rose Glaze</a>, a sheer pink iridescent shimmer that gave major <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wicked-for-good-movie-brand-collaborations"">Glinda vibes</a>.</p>



<p>Individual builder gel shades go for $12 apiece, and you can shop <a href=""https://oliveandjune.com/collections/builder-gel-sets/products/shimmers-new-neutrals-builder-gel-polish-set"">sets of eight</a> for $85 (a savings of $11, off the à la carte price — basically like paying for seven shades and getting one free). Removal is the only thing I hate about gel manicures, but don’t worry, Olive &amp; June has a solution for that, too. The <a href=""https://oliveandjune.com/collections/gel-removal/products/gel-removal-system"">Salon-Speed Soak-Off Kit</a> includes everything to gently remove your gels, including builder. Per the brand, start by trimming the builder extension (if applicable), then file off the top layer of top coat before soaking with acetone.</p>



<p>In general, I’m super impressed with Olive &amp; June’s builder system; I work in beauty, and even I never thought I could do my own builder gel manicure at home. For special occasions (especially ones involving nail art), I’ll still be at the salon; but in the meantime, it’s safe to say that my journey towards longer, stronger natural nails has leveled up in a major way.</p>





<p>As a fan of the existing gel system, I loved that I didn’t have to buy a separate lamp or anything to use Olive &amp; June’s new builder gels. “Builder can be very intimidating for people, especially the building the length portion of it,” Olive &amp; June’s VP of product development Anne Reigle tells us. “And because builder gel is a thicker formula than regular gel, we wanted it to be self-leveling and really easy to work with; it strengthens on contact, lengthens your nails, plumps the surface, smooths the surface, and protects your natural nails all at the same time.”</p>



<p>For my first attempt, I did a DIY mani using <a href=""https://oliveandjune.com/products/creme-caramel-builder-gel"">Creme Caramel</a>, a gorgeous warm tan shade that’s perfect for fall. I’m pretty comfortable with doing my own nails without making a mess, but the brush came in clutch for cleaning up edges before curing. (Also, flipping hands upside down for a few seconds after applying polish helps let gravity create a soft, domed shape to the nails.)</p>

<p>Happy Halloween, everyone! The astrological vibe for the creepiest time of the year is nothing short of fa-boo-lous. The Moon enters Pisces in the morning of October 31st, harmonizing with the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Sun in Scorpio</a> and squaring Uranus retrograde in Gemini. We’ll be in the mood for amusement and pleasure, making this spooky holiday bewitching. It’s a day you’ll want to sink your fangs into. Have a total scream, get wicked, and read your horror-scope below! <br /></p>



<h2>Aries </h2>



<p>It might take a lot of effort and coaxing to get you out and about, mainly because you’re thinking of having a low-key night carving pumpkins and baking pies. Rather than having a bunch of peeps over, you could invite one friend to enjoy your homemade desserts. They’ll relish the flavor and ask to take leftovers with them. When alone, you’ll indulge in a luxurious bath with Halloween-themed bubbles.</p>



<h2>Taurus </h2>



<p>There is enchantment and positivity in the air, urging you to use your power to help others. Your witchy ways can motivate those you care about to do better and change their lives significantly. Being the shoulder your pals cry and lean on, after several Spooky Spiders or Caramel Ales, allows you to offer insight on matters and advise them to evolve. Face the facts, you are their role model! </p>



<h2>Gemini </h2>



<p>Since you’re the charismatic storyteller of the zodiac, tell your pals a true-life scary hair-raiser about a haunting you experienced. After you’ve shocked your friends to the core, let one of them take over, then another, and so forth. The best way to connect is by sharing frightful narratives that bring chills, such as these. At the end of the evening, nominate the best terror-tale to take home a prize.</p>



<h2>Cancer </h2>



<p>Family is important to you, so use Halloween as a gateway to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10722191/venerate-ancestors-year-round"">connect with your ancestors</a> in another realm. Cleanse your altar with copal incense and declutter the area. Place pictures of deceased loved ones on the stand with flowers (marigolds call in the deceased) and a few of their favorite foods or items. Talk to them and celebrate their life. Lean into your shared pasts to honor their memory. </p>



<h2>Leo</h2>



<p>Your intuition is peaking, allowing you to receive psychic downloads from the universe. Take note of what you’re seeing in your journal for the future. These visions could help you make decisions when you come to a crossroads, so pay attention. You’re being told about specific events and situations for a reason and you should use the information to your advantage. Listen with an open heart and mind, Leo!</p>



<h2>Virgo </h2>



<p>The soulful Moon in Pisces is getting cozy in your seventh house of partnerships this Halloween. If you’re in a ‘ship, cuddle up with your boo on the couch and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scariest-movies-of-all-time"">watch a horror movie</a>. If you’re unattached, invite friends or your crush over and play a game that builds intimacy — no, the Ouija board isn’t advisable because it can awaken spirits, perhaps “Never Have I Ever” will be fun. </p>



<h2>Libra </h2>



<p>Although you’re known for your tender temper, this Halloween, your besties will have a chance to see that you are a wolf in sheep’s clothing. You might decide to dress as a character that allows everybody to see that you have at least two sides. No matter what you wear, your rizz will make a grand impression. Don’t fear, your look will be killer!</p>



<h2>Scorpio </h2>



<p>Slay the social scene! Mingle and party with your crew. You may even hit up a few events with everyone. Fortunately, Halloween is on a Friday, which means you can sleep in the following day if the gathering lasts until the wee hours of Saturday morning. Apple bobbing and the Monster Mash will be exhausting, so dance your heart out to Bloody Mary, knowing you can rest and relax all weekend. </p>



<h2>Sagittarius </h2>



<p>Opting to stay in and hand out treats to trick-or-treaters doesn’t mean you’re basic and boring. The opposite rings true. You’re bringing joy to children everywhere by handing out lollipops or other cool goodies they might like. If you want to embrace your inner child, throw on a mask and ask your neighbor to fill your bucket with sweets. Don’t be too shy to knock on their door.</p>



<h2>Capricorn </h2>



<p>For once, you’re not being a tryhard when hosting a soirée. You’re going with the flow and being chill — as long as no one spills red wine on your white carpet or copies your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/halloween-costumes-ideas-pop-culture"">Halloween costume</a>. Regardless, the drinks are flowing, and no one is going, indicating you know how to throw an awesome Halloween shindig. This is a fantastic step towards adulting, so totally own it and cut loose!</p>



<h2>Aquarius </h2>



<p>Looking for a ghoulish time? A bunch of your colleagues want to team up and prank your boss. At first, you might be unsure if you wish to partake in the hijinks, but once your employer lets it be known that they’re down to clown (as long as no one takes it too far), it’s on. This activity helps you to bond with coworkers in ways you never thought possible. </p>



<h2>Pisces</h2>



<p>Pisces Since the transiting Moon in Pisces syncs up with your Sun by sign, this is a time of new beginnings for you. Use the magical time to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-zodiac-sign-2025"">set an intention that brings you luck</a> and makes your dreams a reality. You can manifest anything in your heart if it aligns with your path. Meditate on your goals, light a white candle, and bring your vision to life.</p>

<p>Cosmic beings, the sky is still rippling with the emotional, existential echoes of last week’s Jupiter–Chiron square, and many of us are noticing which parts of our inner child still feel exposed, reactive, or defensive. Jupiter in Cancer wants to nurture and expand whatever it’s touching — but squaring Chiron in Aries can feel like an overwhelming magnifying glass on the sore spots we’ve tried to outgrow. You may notice themes around independence vs. support, overfunctioning vs. receiving, or childhood family roles vs. your current adult boundaries. The key? Don’t try to “fix” yourself… move with yourself. Let your body release some of the internal pressure. Dance, cry, write, scream, walk barefoot in the grass. You’re allowed to <em>feel</em> and <em>heal</em> at the same time.<br /><br />And here comes a bit of lightness: Mercury, Planet of Communication, enters Sagittarius on October 29th, helping the collective release some of that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio heaviness we’ve been marinating in</a>. Mercury in Scorpio had us speaking in riddles, keeping secrets, obsessing over the unsaid, or analyzing every look and silence. We’ve been reading between the lines for weeks — not just in others, but in ourselves too. There’s beauty in that depth, but also a risk of becoming paranoid, withdrawn, or overly cynical. Now, Mercury in Sagittarius swings open the windows. It doesn’t whisper; it shouts joyfully from the rooftop. This is your permission slip to share what you’ve learned, even if it’s still messy or raw. Say it with humor, with honesty, with heart.</p>



<p>Also: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars is in its final degrees of Scorpio</a> this week. If you trace back to September 22nd, when Mars first entered the sign of the phoenix, you might notice that you’ve been undergoing some sort of personal mission — a deep, unflinching investigation of power, passion, and purpose. As Mars approaches 29° of Scorpio, it becomes a culmination moment. A final test. A last temptation. Or, a moment of confirmation that yes, you’ve changed — even if no one else knows how much. The shift becomes clear as Mars enters Sagittarius on November 4th, but this week is your last chance to harvest the lessons of your own underworld journey.You may find yourself asking: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fall-equinox-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects""><em>What did I begin around the equinox</em></a><em> that’s reaching its climax now? What am I finally ready to release — or claim?</em> This week doesn’t rush you to answer, but it will keep nudging you toward clarity.<br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, just because it looks like stillness doesn’t mean it’s not power. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars, your ruling planet, is finishing its six-week trek through Scorpio</a> — your sector of intimacy, control, transformation, and energetic merging. But unlike some of the more dramatic Mars moments, this finale doesn’t scream. It simmers. You’ve been slowly, maybe even secretly, building momentum around something deeply personal. Whether it’s a financial entanglement, a physical craving, or an emotional reckoning, this week could reveal just how much you’ve outgrown the need to “win” at all costs. Do you really need to dominate, or are you just scared of disappearing if you don’t? Mars in Scorpio has been showing you how to reclaim your power without losing your soul. Now’s the time to integrate what you’ve learned about vulnerability, pleasure, and restraint.<br /><br />The week ends with a mic drop — or at least a one-liner. Mercury enters Sagittarius on the 29th, launching you into a more playful, philosophical headspace. Suddenly, you’re inspired to sign up for that course, book that spontaneous trip, or tell a story that’s 80% true but 100% entertaining. And honestly? We need that from you. Just be mindful that not everyone’s as down for blunt jokes or semi-accurate monologues as you are. Mercury here wants you to express your belief systems, but do it like a good stand-up set: hit ‘em with the truth and the punchline.</p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, you can’t carry someone else’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-get-closure-ex-meaning"">relationship baggage</a> and call it love. Mars is wrapping up its journey through your sector of partnership, and if it’s been exposing some passive-aggressive tension or behind-the-scenes resentment, you’re not imagining things. But this final stretch isn’t about confrontation… it’s about clarity. You’ve likely realized that your energy has limits, and the desire to merge has to be mutual. This week, ask yourself: <em>What does it look like to stay connected while still protecting your peace?</em> Mars in Scorpio didn’t just reveal others’ patterns; it showed you your own default settings in connection, especially the ways you overextend or under-express. Let this week be an energetic recalibration in love, business, and even your relationship with your own reflection.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Mercury enters your “let’s talk about the money” zone. Starting October 29th, you may find yourself talking about loans, inheritances, taxes, or even kink. Mercury in Sagittarius isn’t subtle, and when it activates your sector of shared resources and taboo topics, you’re basically in your <em>Succession</em> era — equal parts honest and unhinged. Don’t be surprised if a conversation gets way deeper than expected. Or way weirder. You’re learning to speak your truths even when they’re not pretty — and laugh about them when you’re done.</p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, you don’t always need to optimize yourself. Sometimes you just need to rest. Mars has been powering through your sector of routine, health, and responsibility since September, and now it’s almost out. This week, instead of trying to finish everything on your to-do list like you’re being filmed for a productivity documentary, check in with your body. Where are you pushing too hard? What are you avoiding by staying “busy”? Mars in Scorpio taught you how to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/burnout-at-work-recovery-tips"">confront burnout patterns</a> and perfectionist tendencies. Let yourself integrate. It’s not weakness to pause — it’s strategy. Your real power move this week is listening to your body when it whispers, not waiting until it screams.<br /><br />On a lighter note, your crush might start texting in full paragraphs again. Mercury (your ruler!) enters your opposite sign of Sagittarius on the 29th, lighting up your one-on-one connection zone. This means: more banter, bolder flirting, and possibly deeper conversations with someone who’s actually emotionally available (what a concept). It’s cuffing season, but with memes. You’re feeling more honest, and so are they — even if it’s oversharing in a “sorry-not-sorry” way. Don’t overanalyze the vibe. Lean in. Say what you mean. And maybe download Hinge again… but only if your last message wasn’t left on read.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, not all passion is sustainable… but some of it is worth the mess. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars in Scorpio is finishing its slow burn</a> through your romance, creativity, and pleasure zone, and this week is your chance to reflect on what, or who, lit you up since late September. Maybe you’ve taken bigger risks with your art, your heart, or your bed sheets. Maybe you’ve confused chaos with chemistry once or twice (hey, it’s a learning curve). But this final stretch of Mars in Scorpio isn’t about shaming yourself for what you wanted… <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/what-are-responsive-spontaneous-desire-styles"">it’s about refining your desires</a>. Who turns you on intellectually, spiritually, creatively? That’s your real type. And no, they don’t have to be perfect, just emotionally literate and occasionally funny.<br /><br />Speaking of funny… Mercury’s got jokes now. As of October 29th, Mercury enters Sagittarius and turns your everyday life into a sitcom. You’ll find humor in the absurdity of routines, and honestly? It’s medicine. Your health, work, or to-do list may have felt heavy under Mercury in Scorpio, but now you’re allowed to laugh at the chaos. Expect random inspiration to hit while brushing your teeth or running errands. Talk to your coworkers like they’re your podcast co-hosts. Say the weird joke. Eat the protein bar. Mercury in this part of your chart is a reminder: healing isn’t always solemn — sometimes it’s hilarious.</p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, your power doesn’t need an audience — but that hasn’t stopped you from delivering a performance anyway. Mars is in its final stretch through your home, family, and foundations sector, and even if you didn’t mean to stir things up… you did. But here’s the twist: it was necessary. Since September 22nd, you’ve been privately unpacking your relationship with roots, rest, and responsibility. Some Leos have moved, redecorated, cut ties, or cried in the bathtub — all valid. Now as Mars approaches 29°, the question is: <em>What emotional habitat are you building for yourself?</em> This week is less about dramatic change and more about internal integration. You’ve grown, but have you <em>noticed</em> how differently you respond to old triggers? That’s your Mars work, right there.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Mercury enters your joy sector like a chaotic but loveable bestie. Starting October 29th, Mercury in Sag lights up your romance, play, and passion zone. Translation: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/flirty-text-messages-examples"">your texts might get flirty</a>, your jokes land louder, and you may be tempted to post a thirst trap just to feel something. Mercury in Sag wants you to remember what it’s like to fall in love with your own damn mind — and maybe someone else’s too. Say yes to the spontaneous invite. Go on that “just for fun” date. Make something dumb and beautiful. You’re in your comedic rom-com era, and even if it gets messy, it’ll be entertaining as hell.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, you’re not here to be a spreadsheet… you’re here to be the whole story. Mars in Scorpio has spent the past six weeks in your communication and expression sector, and it’s been a <em>lot</em>. You’ve probably had to have difficult conversations, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/communication-style-mercury-sign-meaning-astrology"">revisit the way you communicate boundaries</a>, or even learn how to stop over-explaining when someone clearly isn’t listening. But now, as Mars prepares to exit Scorpio next week, you’re being asked to <em>trust your voice</em>. Not the polished, PR-ready version — the messy, tender, weirdly specific one. That’s the one that hits. This week, stop editing yourself in real-time. Mars has taught you that speaking up doesn’t always mean yelling… sometimes it means whispering the truth and letting it echo.<br /><br />Now Mercury, your ruling planet, is in full Sagittarian chaos. On October 29th, Mercury enters your home and emotional roots sector, and let’s just say… your inner child is taking the wheel. Expect random family stories to surface, nostalgia to hit during a random song, and for your jokes to get more dark-humor-meets-toddler-energy. You might also feel inspired to say things to family members (chosen or blood) that you’ve held in too long. Mercury here can heal old wounds — but only if you’re willing to talk about the awkward stuff. Say it clumsily if you must. Say it while laughing. Just don’t swallow it anymore.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, you’ve spent enough time calculating your worth… now it’s time to feel it. Mars is finishing its journey through your money and values zone, and chances are your relationship with resources — physical <em>and</em> energetic — has gone through a few plot twists. Maybe you’ve been investing more, spending less, or just noticing where your energy leaks. Mars in Scorpio doesn’t do surface-level; it wants you to understand your <em>emotional</em> relationship to currency. What’s your price for peace? What are you no longer willing to sell out for? This week is about remembering that your value doesn’t require validation. Let the final flare of Mars give you permission to invest in yourself like you’d invest in your dream. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Mercury’s entering your chatty, curious, slightly unhinged phase. On October 29th, the planet of communication enters your learning and local community zone. Expect a surge of texts, new ideas, and the occasional accidental overshare on IG stories. You’re talking faster, thinking bigger, and possibly planning three projects at once. But don’t forget: not everything needs to be monetized or turned into a brand. Mercury in Sag is here to help you <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/03/9602100/online-learning-websites-classes"">rediscover the joy of learning something</a> <em>just because</em>. Be curious, not calculating. Read a weird book. Ask a question you already know the answer to. Let wonder replace your inner critic, just for a while.</p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, you’ve burned it all down and you’ve rebuilt it from scratch. Now this week, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">your mission is to breathe</a>. Mars, your traditional ruler, has been in your sign for the past five weeks — and it’s been both a revival and a reckoning. You may have felt hyper-aware of your desires, more impulsive than usual, and somehow both exhausted and energized. As Mars prepares to exit your sign and enter Sagittarius on November 4th, you’re entering a phase of integration. What did this version of you fight for? What did it finally walk away from? This isn’t about constant transformation anymore — it’s about ownership. Mars at the final degrees of Scorpio is like the silent samurai: calm, dangerous, and done with drama. You’ve grown in ways you don’t need to prove. Trust that your actions speak loud enough now.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Mercury’s ready to spend your money or make you laugh about it. On October 29th, Mercury exits your sign and enters your income and values zone. Suddenly, your inner voice shifts from existential philosopher to impulsive travel agent. Expect a mix of financial epiphanies and random purchases — a tarot deck here, a pair of platform boots there. But deeper than that, you’re learning to speak about your worth more directly. Mercury in Sag gives you the gift of comedic timing and financial clarity… use both. Talk about your rates. Joke about capitalism. Buy the expensive oat milk if it makes your inner child giggle.</p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You’re already feeling the buzz, Sagittarius — Mercury enters your sign this week (on the 29th), and suddenly your inner monologue sounds like a TED Talk, stand-up set, and motivational speech all in one. But before you go launching into a thousand new projects, take a moment to reflect on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">the final full week of Mars in Scorpio</a> lighting up your spiritual sector. How have your subconscious patterns, intuitive nudges, and quiet obsessions shaped your motivations lately? This Mars transit has pulled you deep into your own psyche — not to make you spiral, but to help you break through. Notice what fears you’ve confronted, what secrets have surfaced, and what taboos you’re learning to reclaim. There’s strength in your shadows.<br /><br />With Mercury in your sign and a full moon in Taurus coming up next week, you’re entering a period where your words have weight — and your jokes could accidentally become spells. Use your voice with care. You might be more impulsive, excitable, or brutally honest now, and while that’s part of your charm, Sagittarius, don’t use it as a shield. Be curious rather than combative. The best breakthroughs this week come when you speak your truth <em>and</em> stay open to being surprised by others’.</p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, if you’ve been lowkey exhausted the past few weeks, Mars in Scorpio may be to blame — but also, thank. As this transit wraps up, you’re getting one last push to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ending-friendship-emotional-wellbeing"">reassess the dynamics of your friendships</a>, community, and long-term goals. Maybe someone in your circle showed their true colors, or maybe you realized you’ve outgrown certain group projects. Mars has been pruning your social garden, Capricorn, and now you get to decide what, and who, is worth watering. Make space for the relationships that feel reciprocal, collaborative, and inspiring.<br /><br />Mercury’s shift into Sagittarius on October 29 helps you loosen up and laugh again. This transit lands in your house of closure and healing, so your humor may lean toward the dry, surreal, or even absurd… but it’s cathartic. You might find yourself journaling more, reconnecting with spirituality, or speaking to a therapist (or your dream journal) with newfound honesty. Don’t underestimate the power of being funny <em>and</em> vulnerable. Your dreams may be extra vivid now, so keep track of them. They’re sending you clues. </p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You’re wrapping up a powerful chapter in your career life, Aquarius, as Mars in Scorpio spends its final days in your public image sector. Since September, this has been a time of bold moves, boundary-setting, and behind-the-scenes ambition. Maybe you’ve been wrestling with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-be-successful"">what “success” even means to you</a>, and whether it still fits the version of you you’re becoming. This week, instead of forcing momentum, try to integrate the lessons you’ve already learned. What motivates you to create? Who do you want to impact? Let your intuition be the driver now, not your ego.<br /><br />When Mercury moves into fellow fire sign Sagittarius on the 29th, your social life lights up with new connections, ideas, and invitations. You’re thinking big picture, brainstorming wild solutions, and probably texting five group chats at once. Let yourself flirt with possibility. This is the week to say yes to spontaneous convos, brainstorms, or even signing up for an online class you forgot you bookmarked. Some of the best collaborations ahead will come from unexpected DMs and late-night debates with your fellow weirdos. Say what you believe, then evolve it in real time.</p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, Mars, Planet of Action, has spent the last month stirring your desire for truth, travel, and transformation — and now, as it prepares to exit Scorpio next week, you get a final chance to process what it’s really taught you. Maybe you’ve been craving adventure, questioning old belief systems, or feeling itchy in your comfort zone. But before you jet off or burn it all down, Pisces, take stock. What ideas or philosophies have truly sustained you? Where have you gotten lost in the sauce of someone else’s worldview, and where are you ready to claim your own? This final week is a portal for recalibration.<br /><br />With Mercury entering Sagittarius on October 29, your career house lights up, and suddenly everyone wants a piece of you. Your words hold power now, so use them intentionally. Whether you’re pitching yourself, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/resume-tips"">updating your résumé</a>, or just posting something meaningful online, trust that the right people are listening. And don’t be afraid to bring your whole self — messy, mystical, hilarious — to the table. You’re allowed to be multidimensional (you are a Mutable Water sign after all). The more you let people see the real you, the more aligned opportunities will flow.</p>
