<h4>The future of work in the age of AI and deepware.</h4><p>There is a photograph from 1930s East London that should be mandatory viewing for anyone anxious about AI taking their job. It shows Mary Smith, a “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knocker-up"">knocker-up</a>” — <strong>a woman whose entire profession consisted of walking the streets at dawn, shooting dried peas at bedroom windows with a long bamboo pole to wake workers for their factory shifts.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Photograph from 1930s showing Mary Smith, a “knocker-up,” wielding a bamboo pole with dried peas, shooting them at bedroom windows to wake factory workers."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*rkCJ0XioJKqdRXNE.jpg"" /><figcaption>Mary Smith, a “knocker-up” in East London (1930s)</figcaption></figure><p>Mary charged sixpence a week for this service. Then the alarm clock arrived, and Mary’s job vanished.</p><p>Do we mourn the knocker-up today? Do we rage against the tyranny of the alarm clock? Of course not. Because what happened to Mary is what has happened throughout every technological revolution: certain tasks became obsolete whilst entirely new categories of work emerged.</p><p>Yet here we are in 2025, gripped by the same ancient panic. <em>AI is coming for our jobs</em>, we are told. The robots will replace us. The future is bleak.</p><blockquote>Let me offer a different provocation: AI is not coming for your job. It is coming for your tasks. And if you cannot distinguish between the two, then yes — you should be worried.</blockquote><h3>The evolution we refuse to see</h3><p>Human work has always been in flux. In nomadic societies, we hunted and gathered. Agriculture tethered us to land and rhythms of seasons. Industrialisation moved us into factories, trading physical labour for wages. The information age shifted us again — this time from brawn to brain, from making things to managing data, information, and knowledge.</p><p>Each transition has redefined not just what we do, but what remains uniquely human about work. We moved from physical exertion to cognitive processing. Now we have built what I call “<a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/when-deepware-meets-wetware-the-uncomfortable-truth-about-responsible-ai-245842121749""><em>deepware</em></a>” — neural networks and machine learning systems layered atop our traditional software and hardware. <br />These architectures can process, pattern-match, and produce at speeds we cannot fathom. Yet in our rush to innovate, we have convinced ourselves that <em>deepware</em> can carry the weight of responsibility our <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetware_(brain)""><em>wetware</em></a> — our human brains and nervous systems — seems increasingly willing to surrender. We are moving again, but this time the question is whether we are moving forward or simply moving away.<br />Because this time, the shift is not from physical to mental. It is from execution to <strong><em>responsibility</em></strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""A horizontal timeline infographic titled “The Evolution of Human Work.” It shows five large coloured circles connected by a black arrow, each representing a stage of labor. Nomadic (Hunting): “Physical survival, hunt and gather.” Agricultural (Farming): “Tied to land and seasonal cycles.” Industrial (Factories): “From muscle to machine labour.” Information (Knowledge): “Brains over brawn: data and knowledge.” Deepware (Responsibility): “Execution shifts to responsibility and ethics.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ImgkXpy6k2_U53LUT5K7XQ.png"" /><figcaption>The evolution of work, from hunting to responsibility.</figcaption></figure><p>As <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Narayanan"">Arvind Narayanan</a> at Princeton observes, jobs are not monolithic entities. They are bundles of tasks. Some tasks are routine and susceptible to automation. Others require distinctly human qualities: judgement, ethics, accountability, wisdom.</p><p>The question is not whether AI can perform tasks. It demonstrably can, often better than we can. The question is who takes responsibility when those tasks produce consequences in the real world.</p><h3>Outputs are not outcomes</h3><p>This distinction matters more than most organisations realise.</p><p><strong>Output</strong> is what a process produces. Code. Copy. Designs. Legal briefs. Medical recommendations. Outputs are the tangible results of a system executing its programmed or prescribed function — the direct product of following steps, rules, or algorithms. The term emerged in the industrial era, literally describing the quantity of coal or iron a mine could extract in a given period. Output depends entirely on the efficiency and capability of the process that generates it.</p><p><strong>Outcome</strong> is what happens when that output meets reality. An outcome requires context, interpretation, application, and crucially — <em>intentionality</em>. Outcomes demand understanding not just what was produced, but why it matters, who it affects, and what consequences ripple from it. Where outputs measure productivity, outcomes measure impact. They are the ultimate change or consequence that results from applying an output with purpose and judgment.<br />AI can generate outputs. It cannot, however, create outcomes. Because outcomes require something <em>deepware</em> fundamentally lacks: the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetware_(brain)""><em>wetware</em></a> capacity for responsibility.</p><p>Computers cannot be held accountable, as IBM recognised in 1979. That truth has not changed. What has changed is our willingness to pretend otherwise.</p><figure><img alt=""IBM’s note stating: A computer can never be held accountable. Therefore a computer must never make a management decision."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*KxrF3PVHDs2TbLRh.png"" /><figcaption>IBM note, 1979</figcaption></figure><h3>The accountability vacuum</h3><p>We have already seen the cost of this pretension. A <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/06/03/attorneys-court-ai-hallucinations-judges/"">lawyer</a> in the US submitted AI-generated briefs filled with fabricated cases. A trial in <a href=""https://www.usnews.com/news/offbeat/articles/2025-08-15/australian-lawyer-apologizes-for-ai-generated-errors-in-murder-case"">Australia</a> was delayed because no one verified the AI’s outputs. These were not technological failures — these were failures of human responsibility.</p><p>When a professional says “the AI recommended it,” they are engaging in the same moral abdication as someone saying “I was just following orders.” Both statements attempt to transfer accountability to something — or someone — <a href=""https://emerge.digital/resources/ai-accountability-whos-responsible-when-ai-goes-wrong/"">incapable</a> of bearing it.</p><p>This is the dangerous seduction of <em>deepware</em>: it offers us the illusion that we can delegate not just tasks, but responsibility itself.</p><p>We cannot. We must not.</p><p>The future of work, then, is not about humans competing with AI for task execution. It is about humans stepping into roles where we exercise oversight, judgement, and accountability over the outputs that AI produces. This is not replacement. This is elevation.</p><p>But only if we prepare for it.</p><h3>The skills <em>deepware</em> cannot replicate</h3><p>Here is what the regulations already understand, even if organisations do not: responsible AI demands responsible humans. <br />The <a href=""https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai"">EU AI Act </a>mandates human oversight, transparency in decision-making, and clear accountability chains. Not as bureaucratic burden, but as fundamental safeguard.</p><p>Because here is the uncomfortable truth about <em>deepware</em>: it learns from historical data, which means it perpetuates historical biases.</p><p><a href=""https://www.cangrade.com/blog/hr-strategy/hiring-bias-gone-wrong-amazon-recruiting-case-study/"">Amazon’s</a> recruitment algorithm discriminated against women. <a href=""https://fairnow.ai/workday-lawsuit-resume-screening/"">Workday’s</a> hiring system did the same with 40+ candidates. <a href=""https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/even-a-small-typo-can-throw-off-ai-medical-advice-mit-study-says"">MIT</a> research found that AI healthcare systems told female patients they were more likely to “manage illness at home”. <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/search/can-you-review-this-article-an-G_Tc8IpkTOyF.Bj47m8IfQ"">Judicial</a> algorithms found Black defendants more culpable.</p><p>These are not glitches. These are features of systems trained on data that encoded decades of invisible discrimination.</p><p>So when we talk about the future of work, we are really talking about the future capacity of humans to think critically about the machines we build. To question their outputs. To interrogate their processes. To identify bias. To imagine consequences. To demand better.</p><p>This requires a different skill set entirely:</p><p><strong>Critical thinking: </strong>the ability to evaluate claims, identify assumptions, and distinguish correlation from causation.</p><p><strong>Systems thinking: </strong>understanding how components interact, how changes ripple, how second and third-order effects emerge.</p><p><strong>Lateral thinking: </strong>seeing connections across domains, applying insights from one context to another.</p><p><strong>Scenario planning: </strong>running mental simulations of possible futures, stress-testing decisions before implementation.</p><p><strong>Consequence thinking: </strong>asking not just “can we?” but “should we?” and “then what?”</p><p>Notice what these skills have in common. They are uniquely human. They require <em>wetware</em> that is fully engaged, not atrophied from disuse.</p><h3>The extension that could replace us</h3><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan"">Marshall McLuhan</a> wrote in 1967 that <em>“all technologies are extensions of our physical and nervous systems to increase power and speed.</em>” <br />The wheel extended our legs. The telescope extended our eyes. Now <em>deepware</em> extends our cognitive capacity.</p><p>But here is McLuhan’s warning, implicit in every page: when an extension becomes too powerful, we risk forgetting the limb it was meant to serve. We outsource function, and eventually, capability atrophies.</p><p>Consider the calculator. Brilliant tool. But an entire generation now cannot perform basic arithmetic without one. The extension has replaced the skill.</p><p>Now scale that to <em>deepware</em>. If we allow AI to think for us — to analyse, to recommend, to decide — without maintaining our own capacity to audit and override, we risk something far more dangerous than job loss. We risk becoming obsolete not because machines replaced us, but because we voluntarily stepped aside.</p><h3>The choice that defines the next era</h3><p>The future of work is not a future without humans. It is a future where humans do fundamentally different work: the <strong><em>work of being responsible</em></strong>.</p><p>This means verification before deployment. Critical thinking over speed. Systems thinking over isolated innovation. Accountability at every level.</p><p>It means training a generation not just to prompt AI, but to <em>interrogate</em> it. Not just to deploy models, but to <em>govern</em> them. Not just to consume outputs, but to construct meaningful <em>outcomes</em>.</p><p>It means recognising that as our <em>deepware</em> grows more sophisticated, our <em>wetware</em> must grow more rigorous. Every layer of AI we add demands an exponential increase in human oversight.</p><p>This is not optional. This is existential.</p><p>Mary Smith lost her job when the alarm clock arrived. But she did not lose her capacity for work — she adapted. Her children worked in offices, not on streets. Her grandchildren worked in roles she could never have imagined.</p><p>The same will be true for us, but only if we make a conscious choice: to remain conscious. To refuse the abdication of responsibility that <em>deepware</em> makes so seductively easy. To recognise that outcomes require human judgement in ways that outputs never will.</p><p>Our <em>wetware</em> remains the most sophisticated technology we possess. In the age of <em>deepware</em>, it is also the only thing preventing a future where machines own not just our code, but our agency.</p><p>The next time someone shows you what AI can do, we need to ask them something more important: who is responsible when it goes wrong?</p><p>Because in the end, the future of work depends not on what machines can produce, but on whether humans remember that we, and only we, can be held accountable for what happens next.</p><p><em>For a deeper exploration of the deepware-wetware framework and why responsible AI fundamentally depends on active human cognition, read: </em><a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/when-deepware-meets-wetware-the-uncomfortable-truth-about-responsible-ai-245842121749""><em>When Deepware meets Wetware: the uncomfortable truth about responsible AI</em></a></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a9293109b3be"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/when-machines-make-outputs-humans-must-own-outcomes-a9293109b3be"">When machines make outputs, humans must own outcomes</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

However, these days it appears not as a defiant rejection of values, but as a quiet erosion of purpose met with a shrug of apathy.</p><p>Ends are replaced by metrics, conviction by convenience, and narrative by feeds. Secularism, politics, ideology, and technology are often blamed. However, another force hides in plain sight — design.</p><p>If one had to describe what nihilistic design looks like, it would be sterile, stripped of conviction, void of meaning, and soulless.

The <a href=""https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/the-baroque-style?srsltid=AfmBOorubuaM7Snv5M_p9U5B8ZpV5oc3rLu0axgNjmUbkj6KroOSsSFp"">ornament of the Baroque in the 17th century</a>, the geometric rigor of <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/art/Art-Deco"">Art Deco in the 1920s</a>, the <a href=""https://www.popbae.com/blogs/trends/summer-in-neon?srsltid=AfmBOoo9lDJUkloWIryj199z_wvnX_Gf1PVDfFYLcxG3u-m5OugoYfNF"">neon excess of the 1980s</a> — each seems like a mirror of the society that created it.</p><p>But what if this familiar story has it backwards? What if culture is not simply echoed in design, but shaped by it? What if the sterile and hollow interfaces we produce today are not passive reflections of nihilism, but active producers of it?</p><p>This idea has deep philosophical roots. <a href=""https://www.wilde-online.info/the-decay-of-lying-page15.html"">Oscar Wilde once argued that life imitates art</a> far more than art imitates life. <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-aesthetics/"">Friedrich Nietzsche believed that aesthetics precede truth,</a> that existence itself is justified only as an aesthetic phenomenon. <a href=""https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/mcluhan.mediummessage.pdf"">Marshall McLuhan declared that the medium is the message,</a> and <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/baudrillard/"">Jean Baudrillard pushed it further</a>, claiming that signs and images no longer reflect reality but generate it.</p><p>If this is true, the pattern is unmistakable—design doesn’t just record meaning, it scripts it. And once design withers, culture follows close behind.</p><h4>From story to feed</h4><p>Cultural forms once carried narrative. Cathedrals told stories in stone and glass. Novels and films offered beginnings, middles, and ends that gave coherence to life. Even broadcast television moved within familiar arcs.</p><figure><img alt=""Panoramic view of Paris at sunset, highlighting the golden dome of Les Invalides and the modern Montparnasse Tower amidst historic architecture. Warm, vibrant tones."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*yjxUVTkh6xVmKbl6sJcACg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Montparnasse and Les Invalides, Paris | Image source: <a href=""https://pixers.us/stickers/tour-montparnasse-and-les-invalides-paris-45670313"">pixers.us</a></figcaption></figure><p>Today that coherence is harder to find. Much can be said about the bland architecture of our cities and the thinning narratives of contemporary movies and novels, but one of the most concerning shifts has been in the evolution of streaming television.</p><p>Television experiences that once delivered episodes with self-contained stories now lean heavily on season-long arcs—<a href=""https://medium.com/a-suburban-prison/why-are-tv-shows-canceled-9b95db46a4a4""> arcs that may never conclude if the series is canceled</a>. Stories hang suspended, deferred, or abandoned, and audiences grow accustomed to living with open loops, each pause just another cue to crave the next dopamine hit that never truly satisfies.</p><p>Nowhere are open loops more pervasive than the internet, especially social media. Here, design has abandoned narrative architecture altogether. Scroll-based feeds deliver hours of endless, unresolved experience. Search itself has become infinite — every query spawning new links, new threads, new rabbit holes without finality. These systems do not merely reflect shortened attention spans—they train us into them.</p><p>What’s lost in this shift is the <a href=""https://medium.com/digital-media-society-spring-2020/the-impact-that-streaming-sites-have-on-society-ef45c37f2efe"">collective experience</a>. Once, cultural scarcity bound people together — shared stories, shared rituals, shared meanings that culminated. Meaning deepened because it was finite, because it felt resolved. Now we chase a superficial sense of significance in the infinite. But infinity never resolves. It offers no closure, only the perpetual lure of what lies just beyond.</p><h4>The myth of neutrality</h4><p>Minimalism and modernism complicate the story further. These movements, and their descendants in today’s flat digital interfaces, often parade as neutral. The grid, the sans serif, the clean white background — all claim to transcend culture, to present the universal. But neutrality is a myth. Every omission is a worldview.</p><p>By removing ornament, context, and symbol, design does not simply clear space for function — it establishes an aesthetic where emptiness itself becomes a virtue. This virtue is not neutral—it is rooted in Western Enlightenment ideals of rationality and order. A stripped-down interface tells us that depth is clutter, that meaning is noise, that efficiency is the highest good.</p><p>This unraveling of layered meaning now reaches even long-form writing. Articles like this, which should invite reflection, are met with readers possessed by the demand for expediency — brevity, punch, imagery. Platforms like Instagram and X (Twitter) have trained us to crave immediacy over depth. Pictures replace paragraphs, glances replace grasp, and culture learns to settle for surfaces.</p><h4>Reason without conviction</h4><p>What makes this drift even more insidious is the way design has cloaked itself in the language of reason. Research, usability testing, and A/B experiments all serve as proof that design is objective. Yet philosophy has long shown that reason cannot prove itself.</p><p>As <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/"">Immanual Kant</a> observed, reason always bumps against the limits of what it can justify. <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/"">David Hume</a> warned that no amount of empirical observation can bridge the gap from “is” to “ought.” <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel/"">Kurt Gödel</a> demonstrated that even mathematics, the purest structure of reason, contains truths that cannot be proven within its own system. And <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/"">Nietzsche</a> reminded us that what we take as “truth” often conceals underlying values and power.</p><p>When design insists that data is its foundation, it forgets that even data rests on faith — in our senses, our instruments, and our frameworks. What presents itself as objectivity quickly slides into <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/"">relativism</a>, guided not by conviction but by whichever metric performs best in an experiment. Meaning evaporates in the process. Usability without story, efficiency without soul — these become the hallmarks of design that has abandoned belief in meaning itself.</p><figure><img alt=""Cartoon of two men analyzing a dashboard with charts. A janitor nearby discards a paper. Caption reads, “Do we trust this data?” conveying skepticism."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/1*5niuoxNYCmrP5Fr_COXeGw.png"" /><figcaption>Illustration by <a href=""https://dataedo.com/cartoon/tag/trust-data"">Piotr Kononow</a></figcaption></figure><h4>AI and the acceleration of emptiness</h4><p>Artificial intelligence is the logical extension of this trajectory — an engine built on reason based technology—data, pattern recognition, statistical inference — yet stripped of the conviction or belief that gives form meaning.</p><p>An AI-generated logo may look polished, but beneath the surface there is nothing. It is statistically coherent but culturally vacant, a reflection of averages without values.</p><p>Scaled up, these outputs flood culture with forms that only pretend to carry meaning. The danger is not simply their hollowness, but the way they train us to accept hollowness as normal.</p><p>Worse, their conversational mimicry — the illusion of a voice that “understands” — <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/building-trust-in-opaque-systems-ce38cef741b6"">creates trust where none is warranted</a>. We begin to trust the simulation of meaning rather than meaning itself.</p><p>When design can be generated in seconds, we learn to value speed over depth, convenience over conviction. The more we consume forms without substance, the more we adapt to their vacancy.</p><p>AI doesn’t just produce empty surfaces — it trains us to stop expecting meaning at all. And that quiet erosion of expectation is what makes it an accelerant of nihilism.</p><h4>Design as an engine of nihilism</h4><p>In contemporary design the inversion becomes clear. It doesn’t merely display nihilism — it drives it. Infinite feeds manufacture distraction. Minimalist sameness recasts emptiness as elegance. AI systems hint at human replaceability and then condition us to accept it.</p><p>Today’s interfaces aren’t passive reflections of culture. They script the way we see, think, and value. In their hollow repetitions they embed a lesson— nothing lasts, everything is disposable, and meaning is irrelevant.</p><p>Once these forms take hold, culture completes the circuit. Users absorb the cues and stop expecting depth. The less story, symbolism, or conviction design provides, the more indulgent such elements appear when they do surface.</p><p>The loop accelerates until the pursuit of meaning seems archaic. Emptiness is marketed as efficiency, even clarity. And here lies the danger—nihilism does not remain an abstract idea but becomes a lived condition.</p><p>At that point design doesn’t follow culture — it steers it, training us not only to live without meaning but to stop wanting it. That is how nihilism, once a philosophical diagnosis, becomes the default atmosphere of everyday life. And sadly, we are in the midst of such decay.</p><h4>Toward a design of meaning</h4><p>If this diagnosis is right, then design carries more responsibility than we often admit. It is not neutral. It is not merely reactive. It is formative. Which means that if design has played a role in producing nihilism, it can also play a role in resisting it.</p><p>The challenge is not to restore some lost objectivity — that foundation never existed. The challenge is to create values where none are given. Nietzsche saw this as the only way through nihilism — to become creators of meaning rather than its mourners.</p><p><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kierkegaard/"">Søren Kierkegaard</a>, too, understood that escaping despair required more than reason—it demanded a leap of faith, an act of commitment that could not be justified in advance.</p><p>For design, that means reintroducing narrative into interfaces, reclaiming symbolism, and insisting that even in a secular and fragmented modern society, design can be an act of conviction rather than resignation. Meaning doesn’t emerge from an infinite feed of possibilities but from forms that resolve, gestures that culminate, and experiences that cohere.</p><p>Some designs already gesture in this direction. <a href=""https://duolingo-papers.s3.amazonaws.com/reports/Duolingo_whitepaper_duolingo_method_2023.pdf"">Duolingo, for example, transforms small units of repetition into a narrative of progress</a> — each lesson resolves, each milestone carries symbolic weight. It shows that interfaces need not be hollow loops of engagement, but can script arcs of meaning that accumulate over time.</p><figure><img alt=""“Left side: An orange flame and ‘5 day streak’ indicate practice consistency.

Its strength lies in its boundary—you can’t binge it, and its closure is literal and shared.</p><p>Because the puzzle is the same for everyone, it becomes a point of convergence — a common experience across strangers and communities.

Every decision is ethical labyrinth. Every omission shapes culture. Every interface is an argument about how meaning works. If our designs are hollow, they will train us into hollowness. If they carry conviction, they will cultivate conviction.</p><h4>Choosing meaning</h4><p>We like to say design reflects culture, but that’s only half the truth. Culture also reflects design. And the interfaces we are building today don’t just echo nihilism — they embed it, normalize it, and accelerate it. The real question isn’t whether design has agency, but whether designers are willing to own the meanings they create — or the voids they leave behind.</p><p>Part of the work is rhetorical. Designers can <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/rhetorical-triangle/"">learn to reframe meaning</a> as a kind of metric in itself — arguing that coherence builds retention, that conviction breeds loyalty. If the industry only speaks numbers, then one task is to translate values into that language without losing the values themselves.</p><p>If we refuse that responsibility, our interfaces will go on teaching the same lesson, swipe after swipe—that meaning itself is negotiable, optional, disposable. And the more we live inside those lessons, the more we risk losing the very capacity to imagine life beyond the abyss.</p><p><strong><em>Don’t miss out! </em></strong><a href=""https://micbuckcreative.medium.com/subscribe""><strong><em>Join my email list</em></strong></a><strong><em> and receive the latest content.</em></strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4b8617293462"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/contemporary-design-doesnt-just-reflect-nihilism-it-creates-it-4b8617293462"">Contemporary design doesn’t just reflect nihilism, it creates it.</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Living in Orlando, it doesn’t really start to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fall-2025-fashion-beauty-trends-forecast""><em>feel</em> like fall</a> until the season’s already over and winter sets in, if we’re lucky. The crispy air, crunchy leaves, and sweater weather are more of a Pinterest board dream than a Florida reality.<br /><br />But Southern folks have our ways of faking fall: visiting pumpkin patches in 85-degree heat, weekend camping trips, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2014/10/76621/hocus-pocus""><em>Hocus Pocus</em></a><em> </em>movie nights with the electric fireplace crackling, and scares at Universal’s Halloween Horror Nights.<br /><br />Still, nothing tricks us into the spirit of autumn quite like scent. The smell of spiced apples and burnt sugar sends us right into an episode of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/11/129035/gilmore-girls-rewatching-show-new-opinion-love-hate""><em>Gilmore Girls</em></a>, even if we’re in shorts. That’s probably why candle sales spike in the fall. According to the National Candle Association, more than <a href=""https://candles.org/facts-figures-2/"">35% of candle sales</a> happen in the fourth quarter, with many candle brands beginning to see major increases in September. <br /><br />Scent is the strongest sense tied to memory. So fall candles do more than smell good — they transport us. Aromas like pumpkin chai or caramel pecan take us to a cozy kitchen filled with baked goods and warm mugs, while woodsy notes like cedar, amber, or smoke pull us into forests or bonfires.<br /><br />Whether you’re embracing crisp autumn changes or creating your own version of the season, these Latine-owned candles will help set the scene and the scent.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

Her creations blend cultural nostalgia with nourishment, and the autumn collection is no exception. It’s filled with cozy notes that evoke both tradition and seasonal warmth. Our favorite is the Pumpkin Horchata Spice candle, a vegan coconut wax with a rich blend of cinnamon, pumpkin, amaretto, and nutmeg that smells like sipping a warm cup of homemade horchata by candlelight. <br /><br /><strong>Casita Michi</strong> Casita Michi's Pumpkin Horchata Spice Candle, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaels.com%2Fmakerplace%2Fproduct%2Fpumpkin-horchata-spice-coconut-wax-scented-candle-516964595498713088&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fbest-fall-candles-2025-latine"">Michaels</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1344"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936130.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1158&amp;height=1344&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=193:224"" width=""1158"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://soylatinacandles.com/"">Soy Latina Candles</a> is a Los Angeles-based, vegan, cruelty-free, and handmade home and body brand that creates luxury fragrances designed to evoke emotion and spark scent memories. And when we smell Otoño en Casa, we feel like we're stepping into the kitchen of owner Krystal Flores’ abuelita on a cool afternoon, a place that’s warm, safe, and surrounded by love. With comforting notes of pumpkin, nutmeg, myrrh, and wood, it’s the perfect cozy fall fragrance.<br /><br /><strong>Soy Latina Candles</strong> Soy Latina Candles' Otoño en Casa Candle, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsoylatinacandles.com%2Fproducts%2Fotono-en-casa"">Soy Latina Candles</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1554"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936134.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1552&amp;height=1554&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=776:777"" width=""1552"" /><figcaption>Miami-based candlemaker <a href=""https://albisacandles.com/"">Albisa Candles</a> is known for crafting scents that instantly transport people to Cuban kitchens — from the steamy swirl of café con leche to the warmth of just-baked Cuban bread. Their Pumpkin Flan candle is no exception, bringing us right back to the dining table (and honestly, is there any place better to be?). Fresh pumpkin blends with silky caramel, warm spices, and brown sugar to create a mouth-watering fragrance that smells just like the yummy, nostalgic dessert.<br /><br /><strong>Albisa Candles</strong> Albisa Candles Pumpkin Flan Candle, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Falbisacandles.com%2Fproducts%2Fpumpkin-flan-candle&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fbest-fall-candles-2025-latine"">Albisa Candles</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1552"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936137.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1532&amp;height=1552&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=383:388"" width=""1532"" /><figcaption>Afro-Cuban and Guyanese founder Aisha Zakiya pours her popular <a href=""https://www.thevelanegra.com/"">Vela Negra</a> candles using black wax, chosen for its ability to absorb and dispel negative energies.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936075.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>I have to confess: I’m not a World Cup fan. Or a soccer fan. Or any kind of sports fan, for that matter. But my fiancé is something of a fanatic. He’s an avid supporter, follower, watcher, cheerer of the World Cup, and even though we’re still about a year out from the biggest soccer event in the world, he’s already talking about it, incessantly and fervently — so much so that I now can’t help but be swept up in his enthusiasm. It’s utterly palpable. </p>



<p>So, here’s what I’ve learned: The FIFA World Cup 26<sup>TM</sup> is <em>a really big deal, </em>because not only will it be the largest, with 48 participating teams, but it’s heading stateside. For the first time ever, the World Cup is being co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico. That means, over the course of a month (from June 11 to July 19, 2026), the tournament will span North America, kicking off in Mexico City, with matches being played in major cities, like Los Angeles, Miami, and Toronto, before culminating in the final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936105.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>That also<em> </em>means, for U.S. folks, we can tune in to watch at an appropriate time — and not, say, forced to wake up at the crack of dawn, all groggy and bleary-eyed, to catch a 5 a.m. match — because we’re physically close in proximity to the action. </p>



<p>Luckily for my fiancé and myself, I don’t have to stress over securing tickets, because <a href=""https://verizon.com/FIFA"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Verizon</a> is launching Verizon Ultimate Access and partnering with David Beckham to reward its customers with thousands of free tickets to every match, including the final(!). Also, Verizon is making it possible for us to get <em>even closer</em> to the action by offering select “Golden Tickets,” Willy Wonka-style, for unprecedented, once-in-a-lifetime pitchside access — a space traditionally, exclusively reserved for players and coaches (my fiancé would <em>freak</em>).  </p>



<p>It’s not just tickets either. Through Ultimate Access, there will be opportunities for customers to partake in unique experiences: on-the-ground activations, giveaways, player meet-and-greets (Verizon has teamed up with a roster of legends like Tim Howard and Chucky Lozano), special events, and more. </p>



<p>I’m told that World Cup tickets are nearly impossible to get (akin to winning the lottery), which is why it’s important to set your alarms, pencil it in your calendar, do whatever you need to do, because free tickets are available starting October 2 through the <a href=""https://www.verizon.com/solutions-and-services/my-verizon-mobile/"">My Verizon app</a> (more dates will be announced on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/verizon/?hl=en"">social media</a>).

rss,www.refinery29.com,https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/getting-comfortable-in-relationship?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss,1759323610,Why Getting Comfortable In A Relationship Isn’t The Red Flag You Think It Is,"Why Getting Comfortable In A Relationship Isn’t The Red Flag You Think It Is

<p>Head to TikTok and you’ll find plenty of excellent relationship advice, but spend too much time in the hashtags <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/tag/relationshipadvice?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">#relationshipadvice </a>and <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/tag/relationshipgoals?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">#relationshipgoals</a>, you’ll discover a plethora of questionable stuff, too. The quick-fire nature of the social media platform doesn’t exactly allow for nuance, and one recent video that threw me for a loop was about getting comfortable in a relationship.</p>



<p>I can’t remember the creator because I swiped past it so fast I almost burned my fingertips. But basically, it was saying “if you’re comfortable, you’re bored and need to leave”. I panicked — I’ve been with my partner for almost two years now, my longest relationship. I don’t even feel like we had a super <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/5-relationship-stages"">intense honeymoon period </a>— I liked him, he liked me, we started seeing each other more and more. We moved in together, got a dog. Sure, for the first few months we were a bit love-drunk, but that settled into comfortable ease fairly quickly. It’s great. It’s chill. It’s nice.</p>



<p>I’m an anxious gal and a lot of my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/dating-anxious-avoidant-attachment-style-switch"">anxiety has centered on relationships</a>. I critique <em>everything</em>. Is my partner right for me. Am I really in love. Do we have enough sex. Whatever my brain can fixate on, I’ll go there — so this TikTok was confronting. Was my relationship <em>too easy</em>? Had we lost our spark, or even had it in the first place? I got stuck in the vortex of TikTok couples dancing around fields of daisies and making out furiously in front of renovated campervans. Captions like “every day is a new adventure with you” abounded. Anxious? I was positively beside myself at this point.</p>



<p>“Feeling comfortable is necessary to develop healthy relationships,” says psychologist Kayla Steele. “To be comfortable in a relationship suggests that you have developed a level of attachment security, which is essential for your physical and emotional wellbeing.”</p>



<p>Speaking to Steele, I realized that a lot of my anxiety was fuelled by comfort being a new experience. Prior to my partner Tom, I had a string of short-term romances that either felt one-sided (my side, ofc) or ended abruptly. None lasted longer than four months, which meant that I never settled into an actual relationship, even if I was calling the guy my boyfriend.</p>



<p>In those early periods, I was on edge — I may have been infatuated, but I didn’t have any security. This lack of security may have felt like excitement, but actually, I was just flying through the air without a safety net. Every time, I crashed.</p>



<p>“Being comfortable or settled in a relationship means that you are able to trust your partner and yourself, and this lays the foundation for vulnerability and intimacy,” explains Steele. I feel this — my relationship might be predictable and drama-free, but the safety cocoon this gives us allows for deeper connection. “For people whose relationships have been marked by insecurity, turbulence, or volatility, feeling at peace can be uncomfortable or even threatening,” explains Steele. </p>



<p>Beneath the thrill of my past relationships was fear — and actually, I never developed much of a closeness to those partners because I didn’t feel safe enough to do so.</p>



<p>Feeling settled in a relationship is actually a place of peace, not boredom. The world barrages us with stimulation at all times — apps, social media, TV, radio — there’s always something in our ears or eyes, and that’s made us uncomfortable with just <em>being</em>. But without relaxing into a relationship, you can’t cultivate true intimacy. Without intimacy, you never get past the surface.</p>



<p>Hollywood kicked off this addiction to thrills — angst, yearning, passion, can’t-live-without-you fire. But social media has taken it and positioned it as a lived experience. Now, we compare our love stories to random people on Instagram or TikTok, and because the nature of these platforms is that simple and shareable equals maximum reach, what we get is binary thinking presented as fact. Life is way more nuanced than “if you’re settled, you’re settling” or “if you’re comfortable, you’re bored”. </p>



<p>Is it any wonder we’re feeling anxious when our relationships are actually at their healthiest? </p>



<p>Still, there is such a thing as a comfort rut. There is a difference between comfort and complacency. “Complacency in relationships is a feeling of being satisfied with the current state of your relationship, without thinking critically or indeed having awareness of how others may be feeling,” says Steele. “When you are complacent in your relationship, you may feel like you do not need to put in effort, and this can lead to dissatisfaction, frustration or even the breakdown of relationships.”</p>



<p>I’m finding this a fine line to walk because it is <em>so</em> easy to take my healthy relationship for granted. Finding comfort and finally enjoying it is like wrapping yourself in a warm blanket. But when my partner and I don’t check in on a regular basis, we find ourselves becoming roomates, not lovers.</p>



<p>“Relationships need a healthy balance of comfort (or security) and exploration (or play),” says Steele. I’m now trying to balance our natural routine, which I really love by the way, with introducing new experiences. That might be going on dates mid-week, making travel plans (even if it’s just a weekend away) – even switching up our daily walks with our dog can snap us out of going through the motions.</p>



<p>It’s also making sure we physically interact — hugging when one of us gets home, kissing each other goodnight, snuggling on the couch. All of this romantic touch keeps the spark alive, I’ve found. Weeks when we go through the motions are weeks when I start to feel disconnected.</p>



<p>But this is just a life problem, not a relationship one. Even when I was single I had to mix up my routine or I would find myself feeling bored and aimless. It’s strange that we put romantic relationships up on an impossibly high pedestal, to the point where the natural complexities of life become Big Problems when in any other relationship or within our own independent experiences, they’re just accepted. There is literally no part of life that doesn’t need a jumpstart every now and then, so why do we expect relationships to maintain the energy they have at the beginning?</p>



<p>I truly believe the reason we fixate on comfort and routine in relationships is because we’ve been conditioned to believe love is meant to be turbulent and drive all the excitement in our lives. It’s not. Love is supposed to be supportive. A truly healthy relationship is one you feel safe in, because <em>then</em> you have the support you need to take leaps into vulnerable places. </p>



<p>I’ve realized that I am responsible for making my life exciting, and that excitement isn’t meant to come from long-term love, at least not constantly. I can share exciting moments with my partner and I definitely notice that our story has waves — we might hit a complacency patch, but then we’ll have a great night out or someone has a life win and the relationship energy changes again. </p>



<p>Honestly, life is so chaotic. It’s actually the best experience ever to have a constant, calming love story at the centre of it.</p>

<p><strong>Job Title: </strong>Freelance writer/visual merchandiser<br /><strong>Industry: </strong>Fashion/retail<br /><strong>Age: </strong>32<br /><strong>Location:</strong> Victoria, BC, Canada<br /><strong>Pronouns</strong>: She/her <br /><strong>Annual Salary</strong>: $50,000<br /><strong>Household Income/Financial Setup:</strong> $150,000. My husband J. and I split our finances in the sense that we have separate accounts to build up our individual credit scores, but we send money between the accounts as needed. It’s an “our money” versus “your money/my money” situation. <br /><strong>Assets: </strong>~$50,000<br /><strong>Debt: </strong>$0<strong><br />Paycheck</strong>: This varies from month to month as a freelancer, but I typically earn between $3,000-$5,000 a month. I also do visual merchandising at a local boutique twice a week, so that gives me a more stable paycheck of around $1,300 a month. My paycheck frequency depends on how many projects I have each month. I currently have three retainer clients that I work with on a regular monthly basis, but I also have other clients that I work with on an as-needed basis, as well as one-off projects. I get biweekly paychecks from the boutique. <br /><br /><strong>Monthly Expenses</strong><br /><br /><strong>Housing Costs: </strong>$1,900 (rent).<br /><strong>Loan Payments</strong>: $0<br /><strong>Cell Phone: </strong>$168 — this includes J.’s plan; we are both paying off new-ish phones in addition to the actual plan.<br /><strong>Internet: </strong>$91 <br /><strong>Spotify:</strong> $20 <br /><strong>Amazon Prime: </strong>$11 <br /><strong>Netflix: </strong>$9 <br /><strong>Hydroelectricity:</strong> ~ $25 (we get charged fluctuating amounts based on our usage and are only billed every few months, but $25 is our monthly average according to our hydro company).</p>



<p><strong>Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?</strong><br />Yes, my parents both come from cultures where education is important and my dad worked in academia. However, I took an alternative route and went to a private fashion and beauty college rather than a regular college or university. I took out a student loan to pay for it, which I paid off in 2020.<br /><br /><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?</strong><br />I was told when we were doing ok financially, and when we needed to focus on saving. Apart from that, my parents did not really educate me about finances.<br /><br /><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?</strong><br />I worked at a rock climbing gym in high school. I wanted to have my own spending money, and I also got to climb for free on the days I worked. <br /><br /><strong>Did you worry about money growing up?</strong><br />Not too much. My mom was a hard worker and she always made sure we were comfortable, but she was transparent about not being able to afford certain things. Still, I never felt that we were seriously struggling. <br /><br /><strong>Do you worry about money now?</strong><br />Somewhat. Things have gotten a lot easier since J. started working again (and got a six figure job to boot), but I also know that life is unpredictable and anything can happen. Even though our household income has essentially tripled since he started working again, I haven’t changed my spending habits very much because I know that our situation could change again.<br /><br /><strong>At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?</strong><br />I moved out of my mom’s place when I was 20. My husband and I have about $50,000 in savings, which we’d like to invest more in the future. <br /><br /><strong>Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.</strong><br />No. </p>



<h3><strong>Day One: Tuesday</strong></h3>



<p>7 a.m. — I wake up to the sound of my alarm, roll out of bed, and head to the bathroom. The cat we’re looking after for the next week follows me in and jumps in the sink while I’m trying to wash my face and brush my teeth. He walks a very fine line between funny, cute, and annoying. We somewhat unexpectedly lost our dog three and a half months ago; she was a senior, but she seemed to be doing so well until her health turned. It’s been absolutely heartbreaking and the grief has been overwhelming at times, so I started pet sitting last month for some non-committal animal companionship. Neither of us feel ready for another dog, but we also miss the presence of a pet at home, so this has been a good solution. I still miss my girl like crazy, but it’s nice to hang out with other animals. I hope she isn’t too offended up in heaven, but I also don’t think she’d want me to be sad all the time. </p>



<p>7:30 a.m. — I make myself breakfast (Greek yogurt with blueberries, peanut butter and honey toast, and a big mug of green tea) and carefully assess how I’m feeling, since I’m meant to go into the boutique and update a window display today. Yesterday I had a blood test that really took it out of me; last year I was diagnosed with a hereditary form of kidney disease (thanks, Dad), so now I need to get biannual blood and urine tests to monitor my kidney function and the progression of the disease. Usually they don’t affect me much, but last night I started feeling super light-headed and headache-y after a simple yoga session. </p>



<p>8 a.m. — After breakfast I’m still not feeling great, so I let the boutique owner know I won’t be coming in. I don’t think running around and climbing on ladders is the best idea for me right now. I wash my dishes and go back to bed to lie down. </p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — I pull my laptop into bed to check if my blood test results are up. They are, so I do a bit of analysis. Overall, all my chemistry, hematology, and mineral levels are within a healthy range, but there are two flags for items that are just under healthy range. I guess that explains my sensitivity to the blood test this time around. I do some more digging to try and better understand the results, and discover that they can be triggered by kidney issues. I share the results with my husband J., who reassures me that everything is probably fine and my nephrologist will let me know if it isn’t. Sigh. I try not to let this disease overtake my life because I’ve statistically still got a few decades until my kidney function really goes down, but it’s something that’s always in the back of my mind now.</p>



<p>9:30 a.m. — A friend calls me to catch up, which is a happy distraction. She lives in another city and we don’t get to see each other very often, so we try to check in with each other every week. She’ll hopefully be moving closer soon, but until then we laugh and share our love through the phone. </p>



<p>10:30 a.m. — I try to get a little bit of freelance work done, because my upcoming workload is looking pretty full with some new client projects on the horizon. There’s one project that I’m close to finishing, so I decide to just work on that today. All I need to do is write one blog article, which I should be capable of doing. I create my outline, start writing, and hope that J. won’t have any distracting calls in the other room. </p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — J. tells me that lunch is heated up (leftover mushroom, zucchini, and lentil pasta), so I head to the dining area. He’s also made me a little salad to ensure I’m eating enough leafy greens (aka iron). He’s so cute. </p>



<p>2:30 p.m. — I go back to my desk to finish up the article. Once I’m done, I check some other client messages: one informs me that we’re switching up pretty much our entire content strategy for the fall, and the other is a new client giving me guidelines for the project. I’m glad that I managed to get the article done so I can focus on my new client project tomorrow. </p>



<p>4:30 p.m. — I check my personal email and see that my Poshmark order (a watercolour print maxi slip dress) has been delivered, so I go to the lobby to pick it up. Generally, I try not to shop for new clothes too much, but this was a good deal and it was filling a gap I had in my closet. I lost a bunch of my summer clothes in transit when we were moving from the UK to Canada, many of which were my favourite dresses (it’s a long story, but basically I shipped a box of clothes to save myself lugging another suitcase during the move and the shipping company discarded it because their label fell off). This new one serves as a replacement. It fits like a glove and J. loves it. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him this enthusiastic about a new piece. </p>



<p>5 p.m. — I’ve been trying to learn my father’s native language after visiting him earlier this year and barely being able to say anything beyond “hi” and “thank you”, so I open up YouTube for some language learning. I love learning languages and find linguistics very interesting, so I’ve been enjoying these little lessons. They’re a great way to stimulate my brain. <strong> </strong></p>



<p>6 p.m. —<strong> </strong>I usually try to end my day with a yoga session, but I’m hesitant because I’m still not feeling 100%. Still, I don’t like how tight my muscles get if I skip a day, so I decide to try a gentle, low to the ground practice; it was a lunge that got me yesterday. The neck circles in the beginning of the practice didn’t feel great for my headache, but I felt ok doing floor poses like butterfly. After the practice, I take a minute to rest and snuggle on the couch with the cat, who enjoys following me around. He can be quite sweet when he wants to be. </p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — We start making dinner, a rice bowl with bok choy, mushrooms, and eggs. It’s one of our go-to easy favorites. </p>



<p>7 p.m. —<strong> </strong>We eat and watch a few episodes of <em>The OC</em>, our current rewatch. For dessert, we have cherries and I sip on my favourite decaf tea (rooibos chai). I’m dreading the end of summer and berry season. </p>



<p>9 p.m. — J. cleans up and does the dishes while I get ready for bed. He wants to game for a bit before sleeping, but I want to read so I go to the bedroom. The cat is passed out on his side when I arrive, it’s pretty cute. I settle in and grab my book; I’ve been making my way through the <em>Wheel of Time</em> series and am currently on book five. It feels like my energy levels are coming back, so I hope a good night’s sleep will get me back to normal for tomorrow. </p>

<h3><strong>Day Two: Wednesday</strong></h3>



<p>7 a.m. — I wake to my alarm and kitty kisses. I don’t <em>need </em>to get up immediately, so I lay in bed and enjoy the cuddles for a bit before hopping in the shower. </p>



<p>8 a.m. — I make the same breakfast as yesterday because we’re a bit low on other breakfast ingredients (we forgot granola during our last shop and there’s not enough milk for oatmeal). I notice I’m definitely feeling better, which makes me relieved. </p>



<p>9 a.m. —  Focus time. I’m working on website copy for a new client, so the pressure is on. We had a great onboarding chat and I don’t want to let her down. Her industry isn’t one I typically work with, so I’m feeling a little bit nervous, but she also gave me very thorough guidelines and a lot of reference points so I’m sure I can do this. </p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — I have a coffee date with my mom at noon, so I start getting ready. I’ve made some good progress with my copy project already, and besides, taking a break is often the best thing to do to get fresh ideas. <br /></p>



<p>11:45 a.m. — I start walking out. The café we’re meeting at is only a 10-minute walk away, and it’s a gorgeous day. I think about how weird it still feels to walk without my dog, and feel a bout of sadness. I know she would have loved to join me. </p>



<p>12 p.m. — My mom is at the counter when I get to the café. She grabs us a table outside, and I order myself a chai latte. I’m often skeptical about ordering chai because some places make it too weak, but I decide to take a chance and am pleasantly surprised at the spice level. She fills me in on the family gossip and some other personal things. I give her some little gifts I found for her over the past few weeks, and luckily she loves them. <strong>$7</strong></p>



<p>1 p.m. — The café didn’t have proper food, so I’m left to my own devices for lunch. There’s still some leftover pasta that J. conveniently forgot to take to work (typical), so I heat it up and also eat a mandarin as a sweet treat. </p>



<p>2 p.m. — Back to work. I keep researching, refining, and referring to the guidelines and inspirations. I’m feeling pretty good, but I decide I’ll sleep on it before doing final edits just to make sure my brain didn’t get too fuzzy. I still have a few days before the deadline, anyway. </p>



<p>5 p.m. — I share my draft with a friend who works in the industry I’m writing about for feedback, and she gives me amazing insight that I didn’t think of. I should ask for feedback like this more often. Then I take some time to do creative writing. I think it’s good to take time to write for myself instead of just writing for clients. Maybe one day I’ll write a novel. </p>



<p>6 p.m. — Yoga time! I think I’m ready for a more challenging practice, but I still don’t want to push it so I choose one that isn’t super flow-y. I follow it up with a Madfit “lazy girl” floor workout, which challenges my glutes more than I expected, but I guess that’s a good thing. </p>



<p>7 p.m. — I get dinner started, a vegetarian salade niçoise. Halfway through chopping the potatoes I realize we’re out of mustard, but J. says he doesn’t mind. He’s more interested in the potatoes. I go with a simple balsamic vinegar and lemon dressing, and it’s still pretty tasty. </p>



<p>8 p.m. — We put another episode of <em>The OC</em> on, and I make peaches and cream for dessert because we have some vegan whipped cream that probably needs to be used. I haven’t had peaches and cream in years, and remind myself I should make it again before peach season is over. </p>



<p>9 p.m. — I want to go to bed early again because I have a writing webinar first thing in the morning. Sometimes this time zone really doesn’t work in my favor. I wash up and hop into bed to read a little bit before dozing off.<strong> </strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $7</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Three: Thursday</strong></h3>



<p>6 a.m. — My body wakes me up a few minutes before my alarm because of a weird dream. I’m very impressed by my body clock sometimes. I need to wash my hair, but I decide I’ll do it after the webinar, so I just wash my face and brush my teeth.</p>



<p>6:20 a.m. — Yesterday J. picked me up some special granola and a seed mix that are fairly iron-rich, so I pour it over Greek yogurt and add blueberries for breakfast. It’s pretty good. </p>



<p>6:50 a.m. — After I eat, I sip on green tea and check my emails, only to see that the webinar has been cancelled. I feel slightly relieved because I had another blog request come in overnight and am getting a bit stressed about my workload. I check my plan/schedule for the day and rest of the week to reassure myself I have enough time to comfortably meet my deadlines, and I should. I always do this, but it ends up being fine. </p>



<p>7:30 a.m. — Before starting my workday, I throw in a load of laundry (we have coin-operated machines in the building), run the robot vacuum, hop in the shower, then hang the laundry up to dry. I contemplate always waking up earlier, because I feel so productive. Back in the day, I used to work from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. and I loved it — more so for the early finish. I don’t struggle to wake up early if I have something scheduled, but when I’m freelancing I’m more relaxed with my schedule. Oh well, I guess we’ll see what happens. <strong>$3</strong></p>



<p>9:30 a.m. — I start working a little later than planned (I was aiming for 9 a.m.), but I figure since all my errands are out of the way I won’t have any distractions and can just focus. </p>



<p>12 p.m. — I break for lunch. We have some leftover salad, which I add camembert to because I want to conserve our eggs. They’re so expensive these days that I feel bad having them more than a few times a week. After finishing my salad, I grab a mandarin and head to the balcony to sunbathe for a little bit. </p>



<p>1 p.m. — I get back to work, doing some finishing touches and prep work for next week. I submit the new copy project that I was working on yesterday, and thankfully the client loves it! She only requests one minor edit. I don’t know why I was doubting myself. </p>



<p>4 p.m. — Since I’ve prepped what I can so far this week (waiting on details from clients about other projects I have on the horizon), I shift my focus. Earlier in the week an agency owner messaged me on LinkedIn about a part-time role. I was hesitant at first because there were some points in the job description that made me think I might not be qualified, but after texting another freelancer friend for advice I decide to go for it. The application requires a short video recording that sends me into a panic. Why do employers do this? I’m a writer, not a YouTuber! I re-record the video about 20 times before landing on one where I don’t seem entirely nervous and hope for the best. </p>



<p>4:45 p.m. — I take some time for creative writing and language learning. I’m pleasantly surprised that I have time for both today. Maybe I should wake up at 6 a.m. more often.</p>



<p>6 p.m. — Today I feel like there are no excuses for not doing a harder workout, so I do an upper body opening yoga flow and a quick weight workout. I’m not the biggest fan of lifting weights, but I know they’re good for you so I try to do weight workouts a few times a week.  </p>



<p>7 p.m. — I start making dinner, which is a stir-fry with broccoli, peppers, mushrooms, and tofu. J. is working late, but he gets home right when the food is ready. We watch another few episodes of <em>The OC</em>, snack on cherries, and split a brownie he picked up as a little treat for having to work late. </p>



<p>9 p.m. — I start getting ready for bed as I want to try and wake up early again tomorrow. I read a bit and tentatively put my alarm on for 6 a.m.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $3</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Four: Friday</strong></h3>



<p>6 a.m. — I wake with my alarm, but I’ve lost a bit of my motivation. J. and I cuddle for a bit, then I wait for him to leave before I get up. It’s annoying to try and get ready at the same time and I don’t have to take a long hair wash shower this morning, so it’s ok if I rest for a bit. I’ll still manage to stay on my early schedule. </p>



<p>6:45 a.m. — J. leaves for work, so I get out of bed and start getting ready for the day. After freshening up, I make myself green tea and granola with Greek yogurt and blueberries for breakfast. </p>



<p>8 a.m. — I put another load of laundry in. It’s sheets and towels today, so I also change the bedsheets. The cat thinks everything is a game and climbs under the sheets while I try to pull them over the mattress. I reminisce about my dog, who would get annoyed with me for disturbing her peaceful morning snooze when I changed the sheets. She would lie on the duvet, making it hard for me to put the cover on. I miss her terribly. <strong>$3</strong></p>



<p>8:20 a.m. — I start working earlier even though I woke up a bit later than yesterday, success! I’m working a short shift at the boutique later on to cover lunch breaks because they’re short staffed, but I have a blog I need to write, hence why I wanted to wake up earlier. I kind of regret agreeing to the boutique shift, but I guess I called in sick earlier in the week, so whatever. Still, now that J.’s work situation is really settled, I want to scale back at the boutique so I can focus more on my freelancing. That extra boutique income was really helpful when we were dealing with his immigration and he couldn’t work, but now we’re in a better place. I guess I wouldn’t mind doing visuals once a week or so just to get out of the house and express my creativity in another way, but the other boutique work isn’t really what I want to be doing long-term.</p>



<p>9 a.m. — My blog outline is done, so I take a quick break to finish up the laundry. I find it’s helpful to step away for a second after planning and drafts. Ideas, words, and sentences often come to me when I’m doing completely different things<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>9:15 a.m. — I get to work on the draft. It’d be amazing if I finish in the morning, but I have enough time in the afternoon to finish up as well. </p>



<p>11 a.m. — My draft is in good shape, so I start getting ready for my boutique shift. I realize that since I’m covering lunch breaks, I won’t really get to have one myself. I snack on peanut butter toast and a mandarin (it still feels too early to have a proper lunch, and I have to get dressed soonish).</p>



<p>12 p.m. — I get ready to head out. The boutique is only a 20-minute walk away, and the walk gives me a chance to enjoy the sun.</p>



<p>3 p.m. — The sun is still on the balcony when I get back home, so I have a little sunbathe before it’s gone. Afterwards I snack on some hummus, crackers, and another mandarin. I’ll definitely have a more substantial dinner.</p>



<p>4 p.m. — I finish up my blog, write some social media captions for another client, and tentatively plan out my workflow for next week. Then I take some time to do my own thing. Today I also have time for both personal writing and language learning. </p>



<p>6 p.m. — I had a great little creative session, so I hit the mat and do yoga and a weight workout. But first, I roast some veg (broccoli, zucchini, and mushrooms) and chickpeas with zaatar for dinner. </p>



<p>7 p.m. — I boil some couscous and check on the oven. It’s looking good. Every time I make roasted veg I tell myself I should do it more often because it’s just so easy. </p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — We eat dinner, then watch a few episodes of the new season of <em>Wednesday</em>. The cast is great, I’m so glad they brought Fred Armisen back. I have cherries and mini baklava for dessert. </p>



<p>9:30 p.m. — I’m feeling sleepy from my early morning, so I start getting ready for bed and call it a night.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $3</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Five: Saturday</strong></h3>



<p>7 a.m. — I have a full shift at the boutique today, so I don’t care about waking up earlier. I get ready and have granola with blueberries, a mandarin, and green tea for breakfast. </p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — I head out for my walk to work, soaking in as much sun as I can. I wish I didn’t have to spend my day indoors. </p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — I have leftover couscous for my lunch break. I check on messages while I eat: a few client check-ins and some memes from friends. What would we do to stay in touch when nothing much is going on without memes? </p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — I power walk back home after work so I can get to my local drug store before it closes. Luckily, I get there 10 minutes before closing time. I know how annoying last minute customers are, so I make a beeline for the items I need: deodorant and toilet paper. There are good specials on for both, yay! <strong>$13</strong></p>



<p>6 p.m. — Once I get home, I take some time to just decompress before doing yoga. J. starts making an omelet towards the end of my practice. He’s still cooking when I’m done, so I lay down with our new-ish electric massager. I was skeptical of this purchase because we had one before that mostly just got ignored, but this one’s shape is much more comfortable. I vow to personally ensure this purchase goes to use. </p>



<p>7 p.m. — We eat dinner and watch <em>The OC</em>, and I also snack on cherries and chocolate. </p>



<p>9:30 p.m. —  I clean up and start getting ready for bed. I manage to read a little bit before falling asleep. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $13</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Six: Sunday</strong></h3>



<p>8 a.m. — It’s Sunday, so I’m sleeping in. Or at least I try to. The cat has other plans (he’s walking all over and under the bed, and us), but I have a somewhat lazy morning before getting up. </p>



<p>9 a.m. — I finally get up and head to the bathroom to wash up. Then I treat myself to Nutella toast, peaches, and green tea for breakfast. Now that J. is working again, I’m embracing rest and am trying to take more full days off. It’s been much needed. </p>



<p>10 a.m. — We’re going to the beach later because it’s a hot day, but first J. wants to watch football. Rom-coms love to romanticize British men, but they don’t show you how much time they spend watching football. I don’t mind though. It gives me an opportunity to catch up on emails and other little things. </p>



<p>11 a.m. — I do my weekly bathroom clean. Usually, I try to do mini cleans throughout the week in the kitchen and living room so I don’t have one massive clean to do at the end of the week, but with the bathroom I find it easier to do in one go. We run the robot vacuum at the same time. It really has made cleaning so much easier, as I don’t really have to worry about the floor anymore. <em>This </em>is the kind of robot technology we need more of. </p>



<p>12 p.m. — I make spinach quesadillas for lunch, then we start getting ready for the beach. </p>



<p>1 p.m. —<strong> </strong>We head out, but first we stop by our local coffee shop to get some drinks for our walk. I get an iced matcha, J. gets an iced latte and a raspberry bar. <strong>$23</strong></p>



<p>1:45 p.m. — We walk to the beach, lay out our blankets, and soak up the sun. I try to read as much as I can, but get distracted by the other beachgoers and end up eavesdropping a bit. Oops. </p>



<p>3:30 p.m. —  We have plans to hang out with a friend, so we head back to our place because she’s almost there already. </p>



<p>4 p.m. — Our friend is waiting for us outside, so we all head up to our apartment. I want to shower after the beach and we also need to do groceries (our local grocery store does a weekly 10% off on Sundays), so we split up. Our friend goes with J. (groceries are his domain and she enjoys visiting this particular grocery store) while I shower. J. takes my credit card for the groceries because we get extra travel points for food purchases. <strong>$116</strong></p>



<p>5 p.m. — We all meet back in the apartment and hang out for a bit before going out for dinner. We decide to go to a burrito place that we like, but our friend has never been to. </p>



<p>6 p.m. — We walk because it’s still nice out. I feel a bit sad when we arrive, because the last time we went there was with our dog for New Year’s; the restaurant has one of the city’s best dog-friendly patios and there are indeed a lot of dogs there. Still, the company and the food is good. I order a veggie burrito bowl with brussel sprouts, cauliflower, black beans, and greens. J. pays. </p>



<p>8 p.m. — We walk back home and say bye to our friend, who we plan to see next week for a night market in her neighborhood. </p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — After washing up and changing into lounge clothes, we watch our favourite guilty pleasure show: <em>90 Day Fiancé</em>. We don’t watch a lot of trashy reality TV, but <em>90 Day</em> is our kryptonite. It’s probably because we’re also an international couple, so it always has a certain level of relatability for us. </p>



<p>10 p.m. — We feel ready for bed after the end of the episode, so we brush our teeth and call it a night. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $139</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Seven: Monday</strong></h3>



<p>7 a.m. — I wake up to my alarm and get up immediately because I have another full day at the boutique. It should go by fast as I’m catching up on the visuals I didn’t get to do last week, then I’ll have the rest of the week off for writing. I get ready and make myself granola with peaches and blueberries for breakfast. </p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — I head out and walk to work. It’s another beautiful day. </p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — J. made me a spinach and camembert sandwich for lunch, which I eat on my break. He’s so forgetful with his own work lunches, but he’ll always make me something if we don’t have leftovers. It’s cute.</p>



<p>5:15 p.m. — I meet up with my mom after work because she picked up pasta and black beans for us at Costco. We don’t feel that we buy in bulk enough to warrant a membership of our own, but she offers to get us non-perishables when we need them. I also buy a 15lb bag of rice from another grocery store. Our cupboards will be all set for a while. <strong>$39</strong></p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — I get home and check on a few client notifications I missed during the day. I try not to do actual work on boutique days, but I like to ensure I’m always communicative. </p>



<p>6 p.m. — I rolled out my yoga mat and chose a super stretchy practice because I missed yoga yesterday. It feels amazing.</p>



<p>6:45 p.m. — I make another bok choy rice bowl for dinner. We find bok choy goes off pretty fast, so it’s usually one of the first things we make after grocery day. I also add avocado, because we have two that ripened all of a sudden. The avocado is absolutely perfect. I hope a special word that describes the niche feeling of relief and satisfaction you get when you slice open a perfect avocado (or do something else similar) exists in some language. </p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — There’s another <em>90 Day</em> spin-off on, so we have another trash TV night while snacking on more cherries and chocolate. This franchise keeps us busy. </p>



<p>9:30 p.m. — Time for bed! I get ready and spend a bit of time reading before dozing off. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $39</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>“All in all, this was a pretty standard week for me. I’ve reined in on the unnecessary purchases lately because we’re going on a vacation soon, so I’m trying to save with that in mind. Still, I’ve been wanting to enjoy the summer, so I will loosen the purse strings on little treats like café drinks. I’m going to keep focusing on my freelance work so that I can hopefully leave the boutique and earn more on my terms while still having time for rest and self-care. I definitely feel better now that J. is working again and I can have some breathing room, but it’s also important for me to have my own source of income. This past year has taught me that you never know what the future holds, so let’s see what happens!”</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11935997.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Since the NFL broke the news on Sunday night that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-dtmf-colonialism-puerto-rico"">Bad Bunny</a> will be the 2026 Apple Music <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/28/arts/music/bad-bunny-super-bowl-halftime.html"">Super Bowl halftime show performer</a>, the MAGA-verse has been inflamed — and that’s kind of the point.</p>



<p>When Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, takes the stage on February 8 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, he’ll be crashing the biggest old boys’ club in America as everything the ultra-conservative loves to hate: a Latine who refuses to perform in English, critiques the Trump administration, defies gender roles, advocates for immigrant and queer communities, and calls for the decolonization of Puerto Rico — and he does it all with global reach, power, and support.</p>



<p>While the Latin trap and reggaeton artist-actor recently told Apple Music that he is still “figuring out” what he’s going to do during his performance, the political right have already begun lashing out at the artist.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“While the Latin trap and reggaeton artist-actor recently told Apple Music that he is still ‘figuring out’ what he’s going to do during his performance, the political right have already begun lashing out at the artist.”</p><cite>Raquel reichard</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Conservative podcaster Benny Johnson called Bad Bunny a “<a href=""https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/music/articles/maga-meltdown-over-super-bowl-131445573.html"">massive Trump hater</a>” and “anti-ICE.” Newsmax host Greg Kelly claimed the artist “<a href=""https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/music/articles/newsmax-host-loses-bad-bunny-035618728.html"">hates America</a>” and “hates the English language.” And Ryan Fournier, chair of Students for Trump, suggested that executives at Roc Nation — the entertainment agency founded by Jay-Z, which has partnered with the NFL on halftime show production since 2019 — “<a href=""https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/09/30/bad-bunny-latin-pride-trump/"">should be fired</a>.” </p>



<p>But the vitriolic attacks and reemerging calls to <a href=""https://sports.yahoo.com/article/theres-growing-push-boycott-super-130542029.html"">boycott the Super Bowl</a> come as no surprise. Since Roc Nation began collaborating with the league — part of the NFL’s broader effort to repair its image and address longstanding racial and social justice concerns following the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/09/173847/take-a-kneel-protests-2017"">Colin Kaepernick protests</a> against police violence — every non-white artist who has taken the coveted halftime spot has faced backlash from conservative critics accusing the NFL of pushing a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/02/11253627/woke-meaning-co-opted-politics"">“woke” agenda</a> or prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) over talent. Nevermind that to qualify for the biggest stage in the world, artists must be among the biggest in the world — and whether critics like it or not, performers like Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/02/11666227/usher-super-bowl-halftime-show"">Usher</a>, Rihanna,<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2020/02/9388654/jennifer-lopez-hidden-messages-super-bowl-performance""> Jennifer Lopez</a>, Shakira, and now Bad Bunny are chart-toppers and global icons.</p>







<p>Unlike Jason Aldean — whom Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton suggested as a more <a href=""https://www.audacy.com/kmox/news/national/paxton-criticizes-nfl-choice-of-bad-bunny"">“patriotic” choice</a> — these artists dominate streaming platforms, regularly top Billboard charts, and have massive international followings. Bad Bunny, for instance, was Spotify’s most-streamed artist globally in 2020, 2021, and 2022, surpassing both Taylor Swift and Drake. On the Billboard 200, he has achieved multiple No. 1 albums, including <em>El Último Tour del Mundo</em> (2020), <em>Un Verano Sin Ti </em>(2022), <em>Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana </em>(2023), and <em>Debí Tirar Más Fotos</em> (2025). The finale of his recent <em>No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí </em>residency in Puerto Rico, itself a historic moment for him and his island, was streamed globally on Amazon Music, Prime Video, and Twitch, and it became the <a href=""https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-latin/bad-bunny-breaks-record-most-watched-amazon-music-stream-1235432020/"">most-watched single-artist livestream</a> in Amazon Music’s history.</p>



<p>If Bad Bunny does use his Super Bowl performance as a political platform, he won’t be the first. Many of Bad Bunny’s predecessors have used the roughly 12- to 15-minute halftime show — which is watched by more than 100 million viewers worldwide — as an opportunity to speak out against injustice. In 2016, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/10/177881/justin-timberlake-janet-beyonce-super-bowl-halftime-performers"">Beyoncé</a> incorporated powerful imagery highlighting Black Lives Matter and police brutality. In 2020, Jennifer Lopez wore a Puerto Rican flag cape and spotlighted <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/super-bowl-halftime-kids-in-cages/"">children in cages to protest immigration policies</a>. That same year, Shakira infused her performance with Middle Eastern-inspired tongue-trilling, paying homage to her Lebanese heritage. In 2025, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/02/11852764/kendrick-lamar-super-bowl-halftime-show-reaction-meaning"">Kendrick Lamar </a>and his collaborators delivered a politically charged show addressing systemic racism and social inequity, with Lamar famously proclaiming, “the revolution will be televised,” all while President Donald Trump sat in the audience.</p>

<p>And yet Bad Bunny is arguably the most overtly political artist booked for the halftime spot. Martínez Ocasio has consistently used his music to speak out on a range of political and social issues, particularly those affecting Puerto Rico and other marginalized communities. His 2018 hit “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcHTl9h7TWI"">Estamos Bien</a>” became an anthem of resilience in the wake of Hurricane María, subtly addressing the U.S. government’s neglect of Puerto Rico during the crisis. In 2019, he released “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSh7HIH2pvg"">Afilando los Cuchillos</a>” alongside Residente and iLe, a diss track aimed at then-Governor of Puerto Rico <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/07/238239/puerto-rico-ricardo-rossello-chat-protest"">Ricardo Rosselló</a> after the leak of offensive Telegram chats. The song quickly became the unofficial soundtrack of the mass protests that ousted Rosselló, and Bad Bunny even paused his European tour to join demonstrators in the streets of Viejo San Juan. In 2020, amid the George Floyd protests and the global rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, he released “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8GT33tkQGU"">Compositor del Año</a>,” a spoken-word piece that condemned anti-Black police violence and U.S. racial hypocrisy, stating: “A Black man with a gun is a criminal, but if he’s white, it’s a hobby.”</p>







<p>His 2022 blockbuster album<em> </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/05/10974305/bad-bunny-un-verano-sin-ti-album""><em>Un Verano Sin Ti </em></a>deepened his political commentary. The track “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdQEljUMCEM&amp;list=RDQdQEljUMCEM&amp;start_radio=1"">El Apagón</a>” criticized power outages, displacement, and gentrification on the archipelago, specifically calling out the privatization of Puerto Rico’s electrical grid and the influx of wealthy foreign investors. On the same album, “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjvTQTGogUM&amp;list=RDgjvTQTGogUM&amp;start_radio=1"">Andrea</a> (Feat. Buscabulla)” told the story of a young woman navigating systemic gender violence in Puerto Rico, widely seen as a tribute to <a href=""https://periodismoinvestigativo.com/2022/07/puerto-ricos-supreme-court-chief-justice-is-held-accountable-for-court-response-to-gender-violence-cases/"">Andrea Ruiz Costas</a>, a femicide victim failed by the justice system. And his latest project, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-dtmf-colonialism-puerto-rico""><em>DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS</em></a><em>, </em>was in many ways a call for a decolonized Puerto Rico. Songs like “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvfDaZ4ZT80&amp;list=RDuvfDaZ4ZT80&amp;start_radio=1"">Lo Que le Pasó a Hawái</a>” warned Puerto Ricans of cultural erasure and economic displacement, drawing parallels between the island and tourist-saturated Hawai‘i. The album also incorporated ancestral Afro-Puerto Rican rhythms and jíbaro sounds, grounding its critique in the cultural and musical roots of the island’s working class.</p>



<p>Unlike Latine stars before him, Bad Bunny has made it a point not to make music in English. But it’s not because he hates the language; it’s because it’s not his language. He’s said that just as he grew up consuming English-language pop without fully understanding it, English-speaking audiences can do the same with Spanish. “I am never going to [sing in English] just because someone says I need to do it to reach a certain audience,” he told <a href=""https://people.com/bad-bunny-only-speaks-english-for-specific-people-talks-2023-grammys-7968562?utm_source=chatgpt.com""><em>People</em></a> in 2023. “It’s just that I feel more comfortable in my own language. I think in Spanish, I feel in Spanish, I eat in Spanish, I sing in Spanish.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“And yet Bad Bunny is arguably the most overtly political artist booked for the halftime spot.”</p><cite>raquel reichard</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>And he’s not alone. Despite Trump’s executive order making <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/designating-english-as-the-official-language-of-the-united-states/"">English the official language</a> of the U.S., more than 43 million people in the country<a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/183483/ranking-of-languages-spoken-at-home-in-the-us-in-2008/""> speak Spanish at home</a>. It is the second-most spoken language in the U.S., and the U.S. is the <a href=""https://wearemitu.com/wearemitu/culture/the-us-worlds-second-spanish-speaking-nation/"">second-largest Spanish-speaking country in the world</a>, after Mexico. “This halftime show is a confirmation that Spanish is not just a ‘foreign’ language here, but rather a real-life example of how Spanish is woven into the fabric of American life,” Esteban Touma, a Spanish teacher, linguist, and cultural expert at Babbel, told Refinery29 Somos. “Bad Bunny’s art showcases that Spanish speaking has a place in the U.S. cultural zeitgeist. In fact, this halftime show pushes back on the idea that speaking Spanish is un-American. Let’s not forget that Puerto Rico is part of the U.S.”</p>



<p>And as a colony of the U.S. for 127 years, Puerto Rico’s Spanish dialect has been shaped by its complex history, migration patterns, and the creativity of its speakers. This Caribbean Spanish is sometimes viewed by other Latin American communities as “sloppy” or “ghetto.” And yet, it is precisely this vibrant dialect that Bad Bunny will proudly showcase to a global audience. According to Touma, “it showcases the possibility of a multi-cultural community.” </p>



<p>“Bad Bunny will be on the world’s biggest stage, proudly speaking Spanish in his native dialect, flipping any stigma on its head,” Touma said. “For Spanish speakers and Puerto Ricans specifically, my hope is that this performance is deeply validating.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Unlike Latine stars before him, Bad Bunny has made it a point not to make music in English. But it’s not because he hates the language; it’s because it’s not his language.”</p><cite>raquel reichard</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>And it already has been. Even for Latines who aren’t necessarily Bad Bunny or reggaeton fans, the artist commands respect. Even more so after he<a href=""https://i-d.co/article/bad-bunny-puerto-rico-residency-issue-375-cover/""> told i-D Magazine</a> in September that he left the U.S. off his recent tour dates due to concerns about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids at concert venues. “It’s something that we were talking about and very concerned about,” he said in the interview. While some critics pointed out the apparent contradiction between skipping a U.S. tour and performing at the Super Bowl, the two situations aren’t the same. A one-night, tightly controlled event like the Super Bowl carries far fewer risks than a multi-city tour, where ICE activity can vary widely by location. And unlike the crowds at his concerts, the Super Bowl audience is mostly corporate guests and NFL insiders — not the fans he was concerned about protecting.</p>







<p>Bad Bunny has publicly taken aim at Trump’s policies, rhetoric, and camp before, first following his inaction in Puerto Rico after Hurricane María and, more recently, in 2024, after Trump-supporting comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” at a rally. After saying the joke “wasn’t funny,” he endorsed Kamala Harris for president — a rare move meant to mobilize his U.S.-based fanbase, since as a Puerto Rican resident, he himself cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections. </p>



<p>While Bad Bunny hasn’t said how — or even if — he’ll use his Super Bowl halftime show to send a political message, it already is political. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“In February 2026, he’ll carry that flag, that history, and that ancestral rebellion to the 50-yard line.”</p><cite>RAQUEL REICHARD</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>His refusal to tour the U.S. — walking away from the millions he would’ve earned from what would undoubtedly have been another sold-out stadium run — was an act of protest. And so is accepting the halftime stage, where he won’t be paid, in order to bring reggaeton — a genre born from protest and Afro-Caribbean resistance — and his decolonial Puerto Rican message to the most-watched stage in the U.S. and the heart of its colonizer. A stage where, at this moment, he may have more enemies than fans in the crowd. </p>



<p>There is one thing we do know about his vision for the show, though. Bad Bunny said it’s “for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown… this is for my people, my culture, and our history.” </p>



<p>And it’s exactly that decentering of white America during white America’s favorite pastime that has so many on the right up in arms. </p>



<p>But as Bad Bunny raps in “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYAONSDnMrc&amp;list=RDqYAONSDnMrc&amp;start_radio=1"">LA MuDANZA</a>,” “Aquí mataron gente por sacar la bandera. Por eso es que ahora yo la llevo donde quiera. (“Here, they killed people for raising the flag. That’s why now I carry it everywhere),” and in February 2026, he’ll carry that flag, that history, and that ancestral rebellion to the 50-yard line.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11929972.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Welcome to the final three-month stretch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/yearly-horoscope-2025"">of 2025</a>. October begins with a profound shift in energy as Mercury joins Mars in Scorpio on October 6, sharpening our minds and intensifying our communication. This is an invitation to think more precisely, act more intentionally, and listen to the instincts you may have previously silenced. But with this intensity also comes the potential for shadow behavior — obsession, control, envy, and manipulation may surface both personally and collectively. Don’t run from them. Scorpio energy teaches us to transform, not avoid. The invitation is to alchemize our shadows into strength. </p>



<p>The Full Moon in Aries also rises on October 6, one of the most powerful moments of the month. It marks the official end of eclipse season, a time of revelation, upheaval, and re-alignment. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/03/10388783/fire-signs-zodiac-meaning-aries-leo-sagittarius"">Aries fire</a> burns away the residue of fear and doubt that may have lingered after the Virgo solar eclipse. It’s a bold moon. A “mind your business, hydrate, and own your path” moon. This lunation asks you to let go of comparison and overthinking. How can you trust your instincts more than your anxieties? How can you lead instead of waiting for permission? The medicine is in movement… even a small step counts. </p>



<p>October is one of the calmest months astrologically in 2025, at least on a personal transit level. That doesn’t mean the world outside is still — far from it. Pluto is still dismantling illusions in Aquarius and Saturn is revisiting karmic contracts in Pisces. But amidst the collective chaos, there’s a rare window for personal clarity, rest, and integration. Venus enters Libra, her home sign, on October 13, softening interpersonal tension and bringing a wave of aesthetic, romantic, and emotional harmony. We’re learning <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/sex-love-horoscope-2025"">how to offer love</a> that doesn’t smother. Love that breathes. Love that respects the balance between intimacy and independence. </p>



<p>That same day, Pluto stations direct in Aquarius, adding depth and dimension to the shifts already in motion. Pluto in Aquarius is about long-term revolution. This is the age of dismantling systemic illusions — but it’s a marathon, not a sprint. With Pluto in Aquarius until 2044, we’re each playing a small yet significant role in building a freer world. As the month unfolds, you may ask: what’s your piece of the puzzle? What world are you co-creating through your words, values, and relationships? </p>



<p>The Libra New Moon on October 21 is a deeply loving reset. It invites you to realign your life with justice, balance, and beauty. You’ll feel this especially if you’ve been over giving, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/people-pleasing-sex-life-satisfy-partner"">people-pleasing</a>, or swinging between extremes. The cosmos wants you to come home to equilibrium. Then on October 22, Neptune retrograde re-enters Pisces, joining Saturn in one final wave of spiritual reckoning. The veil is thinning. Dreams may feel more vivid. Feelings may get more intense. But with Scorpio Season beginning October 23, you’ll have the power to go deeper without drowning. The water will rise, but so will your truth. Let this month soften you, not shatter you. Let it initiate your next era. <br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, October’s intensifying Scorpio energy puts you face-to-face with the more taboo, intimate, and hidden parts of life, especially in your sector of mergers, shared resources, and transformation. Mars and Mercury are both in Scorpio for most of the month, and starting October 23, the Sun joins them. This cosmic trio stirs up your inner detective — you’re not just skimming the surface anymore; you’re diving into soul contracts, psychic hunches, and money matters that connect you to others. Themes around death and rebirth (symbolic or literal) could come up, whether it’s the death of a version of you, or a financial obligation reaching its breaking point. Don’t be afraid to ask yourself: <em>What do I need to release control over to allow more flow in? </em></p>



<p>Pluto, planet of transformation, ends its retrograde and shifts direct in Aquarius on October 13, activating your sector of community, activism, and innovation. Over the past five months, you may have felt isolated or less inspired when it came to collaborating with others. But now the tide is turning. You may be invited to take on a leadership role within a collective or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/making-friends-connections-adulthood"">friendship circle</a> — one that requires radical honesty and sustained commitment. This is your cue to start planting seeds for the future world you want to build, both personally and politically. </p>



<p>The month also has more light and ease thanks to Venus entering Libra on October 13 and the Libra New Moon on October 21, both activating your sector of partnership, romance, and compromise. After the full moon in your sign on the 6th (which probably felt like an emotional exhale), you’re craving connection in more refined and graceful ways. This is a powerful time to either renew an existing relationship or open yourself up to a new one — especially one that’s balanced, beautiful, and real. <em>What does it mean to choose love from a place of peace, not chaos? </em></p>

<p>Taurus, October’s Scorpio stellium is activating your sector of partnership, commitment, and one-on-one relationships, and the intensity is real. With Mars and Mercury both in Scorpio this month and the Sun joining them on October 23, you’re being asked to get serious about who’s in your inner circle. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/passive-aggressive-psychology-work"">Passive-aggressive</a> communication or lingering resentments won’t fly anymore — this is the month to speak truth with love. Whether in business or love, you’re being pushed to ask: <em>Is this union bringing out the best in me? Or is it time to renegotiate the terms of our connection? </em>The power dynamics in your closest bonds are up for revision. </p>



<p>Pluto shifting direct in Aquarius on October 13 reactivates your sector of career, legacy, and public recognition. You’ve been in deep reconsideration mode regarding what you want to be known for, but now the fog starts lifting. Expect slow but steady momentum in work projects, brand visibility, and long-term ambitions. Don’t underestimate the power of subtle shifts — how you present yourself, what you commit to, and how much you’re willing to evolve will all set the tone for this next five-month chapter of professional growth. </p>



<p>Later in the month, your ruler Venus enters Libra on October 13 and the New Moon in Libra follows on October 21, both gracing your sector of wellness, routines, and organization. These transits offer a breath of balance and clarity after the emotional highs of early October’s Aries Full Moon on the 6th. This is a great time to beautify your workspace, revamp your daily rituals, or find harmony between productivity and rest. Small tweaks to your schedule could lead to major breakthroughs. <em>What would it feel like to work with grace instead of pressure? </em></p>

<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, this October you’re being pulled into a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/dr-giles-yeo-gene-eating"">deep detox mode</a> as Scorpio energy floods your sector of wellness, mental and physical health, and daily rhythm. With Mercury joining Mars in Scorpio on the 6th and the Sun making its entrance on October 23, you’re being invited to zoom in on the micro-level of your life: how you’re eating, sleeping, moving, and thinking. It’s not about perfecting your routine but noticing which habits support your vitality and which drain it. Watch out for obsessive thoughts or burnout tendencies… Scorpio transits can push you to overdo, but your body will thank you for slowing down. </p>



<p>The softer energy of Venus entering Libra on October 13 and the New Moon in Libra on October 21 lands in your sector of creativity, dating, and joy, encouraging you to lighten the load and lead with play. After the cathartic Aries Full Moon on October 6 (activating your community and friendship zone), you may feel more open to reconnecting with your social or romantic life. It’s a great time to take a break from overthinking and simply enjoy beauty, pleasure, and connection. <em>What would it look like to prioritize your joy, just because? </em></p>



<p>Pluto shifting direct in Aquarius on October 13 breathes life back into your sector of expansion, travel, and higher learning. Over the past few months, you may have questioned your worldview or felt stalled in your quest for growth. Now you’re entering a chapter where bold new ideas — especially unconventional or spiritual ones — begin to take root. You may also be drawn to international connections, publishing, or advanced studies. This is your call to reawaken your curiosity and let your beliefs evolve with you. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831462.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, October invites you to embrace passion and depth as Scorpio transits supercharge your sector of romance, pleasure, play, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9938910/marc-jacobs-interview-perfect-fragrance"">self-expression</a>. Mars is in Scorpio and Mercury will join on the 6th, and starting October 23, the Sun joins the mix. You may feel a surge of inspiration to create, to flirt, to seduce — or to destroy something that no longer excites your heart. Scorpio energy isn’t afraid to feel deeply, and neither are you. But this month, the cosmos wants to see you <em>channel </em>those feelings — into a love poem, a new creative project, or a long-overdue conversation about what truly turns you on. </p>



<p>Pluto shifting direct in Aquarius on October 13 empowers your sector of intimacy, emotional healing, and shared resources. You’ve been navigating slow, subterranean shifts in how you merge your energy with others, and now you’re ready to move forward. This could bring breakthroughs in financial negotiations, joint ventures, or therapy breakthroughs. You’re learning that vulnerability isn’t a weakness — it’s a superpower, and it’s how the deepest transformations occur. </p>



<p>By mid-month, a softer wave arrives as Venus enters Libra on October 13 and the New Moon in Libra on October 21 blesses your sector of home, emotional foundations, and ancestral roots. This energy could bring peace and healing to your living space or family dynamics. The Aries Full Moon on October 6 may have stirred some tension around career vs. home life, but Libra’s influence encourages you to find balance. Maybe that means redecorating your home, tending to an elder, or creating new rituals that ground you. <em>What makes you feel truly safe, and how can you give yourself more of that now? </em></p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831463.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, your roots are calling. With Mercury entering Scorpio on the 6th, joining Mars, and the Sun following on the 23rd, October spotlights your sector of home, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/ancestry-dna-test-black-history"">ancestry, family</a>, and emotional foundations. You’re being asked to go within, perhaps literally, by spending more time in your sanctuary, or spiritually, by reflecting on where you come from and where you’re headed. These transits may stir up old memories, family dynamics, or a desire to redefine your concept of safety. What makes you feel held? What patterns are ready to be broken so new ones can blossom? </p>



<p>The Aries Full Moon on the 6th energizes your expansion zone and ignites your sector of travel, publishing, spirituality, and belief systems. You might feel a rush of inspiration, like you’re ready to leap into the unknown. What truth are you aching to tell, what place are you longing to visit? Venus enters Libra on the 13th and the Libra New Moon follows on the 21st, bringing harmony and fresh connections to your communication sector. This is the time to send the email, write the song, or have that overdue heart-to-heart. Words are your superpower in the second half of the month — let them shine. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Pluto, planet of transformation, stations direct in your partnership sector on October 13, after months of slow, subterranean shifts. You may gain clarity around a relationship that’s felt stuck, whether it’s a business contract, creative collaboration, or romantic entanglement. This isn’t light stuff… Pluto asks for soul truth. If a dynamic has become toxic, you’ll feel it more intensely now. But if it’s meant to deepen, you’ll find yourself navigating the necessary growth to sustain it. </p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831464.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, your mind is buzzing with revelations this October. With Mars and Mercury (your planetary ruler) both in Scorpio, and the Sun joining them on the 23rd, your sector of communication, learning, local travel, and curiosity is on fire. You may find yourself <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/01/11636388/daily-journaling-mental-health-benefits"">journaling more</a>, reconnecting with siblings or childhood friends, or developing a skill that’s long intrigued you. This is your cosmic permission slip to follow your intellectual obsessions, even if they seem random at first. The more you explore, the more synchronicity you’ll find. </p>



<p>The Aries Full Moon on October 6 highlights your intimacy sector, revealing where power is being shared — or not. Emotions may run high around finances, trust, or sexual vulnerability. Let truth, not fear, guide your release. Venus entering Libra on the 13th and the Libra New Moon on the 21st bring blessings to your money zone. This is your moment to manifest new sources of income, reimagine your relationship to value, and magnetize abundance by remembering what you’re worth. </p>



<p>When Pluto stations direct in Aquarius on October 13, your sector of health, habits, work-life balance, and purpose begins to churn with forward momentum. Something that’s been stagnant in your daily rhythm may crack open. You could experience a shift in how you work or serve others, especially if burnout or over-responsibility has crept in. Pluto’s been whispering to you about long-term transformation; now that whisper may become a roar. </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831465.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, the month of October wants to empower your worth. It’s your birthday season until the 23rd, so you’re feeling yourself and everyone around you is too. Mars is already in Scorpio, Mercury joins it on the 6th, and the Sun follows on the 23rd, meaning your sector of money, value, self-esteem, and resources is lit up for most of the month. The Scorpio emphasis will make you extra aware of any energetic leaks — people, projects, or beliefs that drain rather than enrich you. This is a powerful time to revisit your relationship to earning, saving, and investing, especially if you’re ready to shift from scarcity into sustainability. <br /><br />The Aries Full Moon on October 6 lights up your relationship sector, bringing clarity to a partnership dynamic. Whether it’s a green light to go deeper or a cosmic nudge to walk away, trust your gut. Venus, your planetary ruler, enters your sign on the 13th, and the Libra New Moon on the 21st is your annual reset. Think of this as a rebirth of self-love, magnetism, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/boost-confidence-tips"">and confidence</a>. You’re blooming… and you’re allowed to be seen. <br /><br />Another highlight of the month is Pluto’s shift direct in Aquarius on October 13, which supercharges your joy sector, stimulating feelings of romance, creativity, play, and pleasure. A passion you once shelved may return with new life, or you may feel emboldened to pursue a relationship, hobby, or project that feels deeply soul-fed. Pluto’s been teaching you to follow your bliss unapologetically. You’re not here to live small, and this month you’re finally ready to prove it. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831467.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, this month is <em>your </em>solar season, and it begins with a bang. Mars, your co-ruler, has already been in your sign, energizing your sector of self, since September 22. Mercury joins on October 6, making your words more potent and intuitive than usual. And then the Sun enters your sign on October 23, kicking off your birthday season with deep rebirth energy. People are noticing your glow, and more than that, they’re feeling your power. This is a cosmic green light to take up space, honor your boundaries, and reclaim parts of yourself that you once disowned. <br /><br />The Aries Full Moon on October 6 highlights your wellness sector. It’s a wake-up call around your energy levels, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2022/08/11094946/cooking-mental-health-benefits-anxiety-ocd"">daily rituals</a>, and the way you care for your body. Something’s gotta give… but you already know what it is. Venus entering Libra on October 13 and the Libra New Moon on the 21st activate your sector of endings, dreams, and solitude. You may feel more introspective, even withdrawn. But don’t mistake quiet for weakness. You’re in a cocoon, and your wings are forming. <br /><br />Pluto, your modern ruler, stations direct in Aquarius on October 13, shifting your home and emotional foundation sector. This is the start of a profound new chapter in how you feel held, safe, and rooted — internally and externally. You might revisit childhood wounds or feel the urge to move, redecorate, or change the dynamics in your household. Whatever comes up, know it’s in service of building the kind of sanctuary that supports your evolution. </p>



<p>And then, Scorpio, on October 23rd your solar return season <em>begins</em>! With Mercury and Mars in your sign alongside the Sun, you’re not just the center of attention… you <em>are </em>the symbol of rebirth and transformation. This is a rare trifecta that puts your voice, your willpower, and your aura on high. What do you want to be known for this new solar year? What version of you is rising from the ashes? Whether you’re turning 18 or 80, you’re being reborn — and you have the mic. Use the spotlight with intention. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831468.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, this month’s cosmic momentum starts with a bang. The Aries Full Moon on October 6 lights up your sector of fate, pleasure, and true love. Your heart may feel full to-bursting with emotion, whether from joy, grief, nostalgia, or surprise. Someone from the past could reappear, or you may have a breakthrough around a passion project, creative calling, or romantic dynamic. Venus entering Libra on the 13th and the Libra New Moon on the 21st activate your sector of friendships, community, and technology. New collaborations and invitations may arise, particularly through digital spaces or creative collectives. Don’t underestimate the power of the DMs or a random <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/whatsapp-adds-reactions"">group chat</a> — love and opportunity are flowing through networks. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Pluto in Aquarius stations direct in your communication sector on October 13 after months of internal rewiring. If you’ve felt blocked, misunderstood, or overly cautious with your voice, this transit could unlock the dam. But Pluto doesn’t deal in fluff. This is truth serum energy — the kind that makes you write the real poem, send the difficult message, or admit what’s been brewing under the surface. Your voice is evolving, and so are your connections. </p>



<p>All month long, a powerful Scorpio stellium is stirring behind the scenes in your chart. With Mars and Mercury moving through your spiritual sector, and the Sun joining them on the 23rd, you’re entering a period of retreat, reflection, and deep psychic clearing. This is the preparation before your rebirth. Let solitude become your sanctuary. Vivid dreams, ancestral downloads, and intuitive nudges are part of the path now. Don’t rush clarity — let it come like thunder after stillness. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831469.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the month of October begins with a blast of emotional intensity. The Aries Full Moon on October 6 brings matters of home, family, and inner security to the forefront. Whether you’re processing <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/07/10548053/childhood-memories-kitchen-plate-patterns-casserole-dish"">old childhood memories</a> or physically rearranging your living space, the energy is calling you back to your roots. Venus entering Libra on October 13 and the New Moon in Libra on the 21st highlight your career and reputation sector, offering a new beginning. You may receive public recognition, a job offer, or simply clarity on your path. Let your diplomacy, vision, and grace lead the way — especially in tense situations. </p>



<p>Pluto, the planet of transformation, stations direct in your money sector on October 13. Financial decisions you’ve been sitting on may suddenly feel more clear. This could involve shared assets, long-term investments, or completely reimagining what security means to you. Deep-rooted fears around scarcity may rise mid-month, but so will your ability to transform them. Your relationship with money is evolving into something more empowered and spiritually aligned. </p>



<p>The Scorpio stellium this month — Mercury entering on the 6th, Mars continuing its journey, and the Sun joining on the 23rd — spotlights your friendship and social network sector. You’re craving depth and authenticity in your connections. Some people may fall away, others may surprise you with their loyalty. You might also feel called to align your activism or community involvement with your personal values in a more intentional way. Lead with integrity and magnetize your soul fam. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831471.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The Aries Full Moon on October 6 activates your communication sector, Aquarius. Expect information to move fast — texts, emails, intuitive downloads, or even sudden conversations that shift everything. This is a powerful lunation to express yourself, pitch ideas, or revisit a conversation that’s been on your heart. Venus entering Libra on October 13 and the New Moon in Libra on October 21 bless your travel and expansion sector. You might feel drawn to book a trip, return to school, or explore new spiritual or philosophical frameworks. The universe wants you to widen your worldview — follow the breadcrumbs. </p>



<p>On October 13, Pluto in Aquarius stations direct in your sign after a four-month retrograde. This is monumental. After months of internal excavation, you’re emerging with sharper clarity on who you’re becoming. Pluto’s transit through Aquarius is a 20-year <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/sweaty-betty-inspiring-women-advice"">transformation of your identity</a>, and this station is like a power boost. You may feel more emotionally intense, intuitive, or even impatient with surface-level versions of yourself. Trust that the real you is unfolding in divine time. </p>



<p>Throughout the month, a Scorpio stellium (Mars, Mercury entering Scorpio on the 6th, and the Sun on the 23rd) intensifies your career and legacy sector. You’re being watched, and not in a creepy way. You’re being seen as a force of influence, someone with the courage to challenge outdated systems and offer new blueprints. Take your time crafting your message. This month’s Scorpio energy demands strategy, precision, and purpose. Your next big move is being built in the shadows before it rises to the stage. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831472.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, the Aries Full Moon on October 6 highlights your financial axis, particularly your relationship to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/loud-budgeting-money-boundaries"">personal income, budgeting</a>, and material value. This month you may feel like a wave of clarity is pushing you to release old money patterns or speak more honestly about your worth. Venus enters Libra on the 13th and the New Moon follows on the 21st, lighting up your sector of intimacy, merging, and emotional contracts. These transits invite you to examine who you trust with your heart — and who you trust with your energy, finances, and secrets. </p>



<p>Pluto in Aquarius stations direct in your sector of healing, closure, and the subconscious mind on October 13. This is a deep underworld portal being reopened. Emotions you thought were “dealt with” might bubble back up — not to punish you, but to be fully transmuted. This is a powerful time to return to therapy, meditation, dreamwork, or spiritual studies. Pay attention to what your dreams or body are trying to say. Pluto will guide you into wholeness through surrender. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Scorpio stellium this month is all about elevation. Mars and Mercury (starting October 6) plus the Sun (starting the 23rd) activate your sector of expansion, truth-telling, and long-term vision. This is one of the most aligned times of year to share your voice, book that spiritual retreat, or write the proposal that’s been sitting in your drafts. You’re not just imagining new horizons, you’re ready to leap toward them.</p>

<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>What are Amazon Prime Big Deal Days?</h2>



<p>Prime Day started out as a one-day sale in 2015 to mark Amazon’s 20th anniversary, and has now become a full 48-hour shopping event that takes place twice a year. It’s fully become its own shopping holiday, rivaling Black Friday. Prime Day (and its <strong><a href=""https://amzn.to/3KkD9zd"">Big Deal Days</a></strong> sister holiday) itself has evolved over the past decade, but what you can always expect are daily and hourly deals on a massive selection of the site’s best-selling items, both from in-house brands as well as familiar names in fashion, beauty, and more. </p>



<h2>When is Prime Big Deal Days this year?</h2>



<p><a href=""https://amzn.to/3KkD9zd"">Prime Big Deal Days 2025</a> will take place on <strong>October 7 and 8</strong>. Watch this space to discover which products you need to snag ASAP and how you can access the sale.</p>



<h2>What is on sale for Prime Big Deal Days?</h2>



<p>As with previous Prime Days, products across beauty, fashion, home, tech, and more will be on sale this week as part of the event. While you wait for the deals to begin, you can shop early discounts on everyday essentials, home tech, and more. </p>



<h2>How do I get access to Prime Big Deal Days?</h2>



<p>There’s no way around it: You have to be an Amazon Prime member to access these discounts. Set deal alerts based on your shopping and search history for personalized recommendations through the Amazon app. (Alexa can also help you in this department.)</p>



<h2>Is Prime Big Deal Days worth it?</h2>



<p>As mentioned above, if you’re unsure about the benefits of joining Amazon Prime but don’t want to miss out on Prime Day, you can sign up for a free (!) 30-day trial. (This is kind of the perfect time to work the system, but, if you love the benefits, you can keep your membership after the trial period for $14.99 a month.) In addition to the marquee benefits of free lightning-fast shipping and hours of entertainment via Prime Video, there are lesser-known conveniences, like discounts from Amazon Pharmacy, early access to blink-and-you’ll-miss-them Lightning Deals, and ad-free music and podcasts with Amazon Music.</p>



<h2>Does Amazon ever offer discounts on Prime memberships?</h2>



<p>If you decide you like the Prime lifestyle and want to keep your access to everything Amazon has to offer, there are two ways to get an ongoing discount on your Prime membership. <a href=""https://amzn.to/448ycOr"">College students are eligible for a six-month free trial</a> followed by a $7.49 monthly fee for Prime, which is 50% off the regular monthly price. In addition, if you<a href=""https://amzn.to/3NHNPHp""> receive government benefits</a> in the form of SNAP, WIC, or other EBT programs, you can get Prime perks for a discounted $6.99 per month.</p>



<h2>What deals will Amazon’s competitors have during Prime Big Deal Days?</h2>



<p>Amazon has done such a thorough job of creating a frenzy around Prime Day that almost every other big-box retailer under the sun (Best Buy, Target, Walmart, even eBay) is likely to run some sort of alternative sale around then. All’s fair in love and shopping, right? </p>
