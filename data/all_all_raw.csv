Since then, UIA congresses have been held every three years in a different city within a member country, serving as the organisation's main recurring event. In 2026, the Congress will be held in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/barcelona"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Barcelona</a>, and <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/966002/barcelona-named-unesco-world-capital-of-architecture-for-2026"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">UNESCO has consequently designated the city as the World Capital of Architecture 2026</a>.

This creates an unexpectedly open view. Because the land is within a greenbelt zone, there are few buildings nearby. What makes the site unusual is the presence of a half-finished garden and fish pond. These remnants of a former business give the place an awkward atmosphere, rather than a natural one.</p>",

<p>Kirkkonummi is a municipality of 40,000 inhabitants near Helsinki built around its Medieval stone church. Facing the church, JKMM has transformed the old city library. Together with the nearby open market, the church and library create the civic centre of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/kirkkonummi"">Kirkkonummi</a>. JKMM have therefore emphasised the relationship of the library with the neighbouring church by designing a 50-metre long sheltered terrace overlooking the church yard. The copper shingle cladding of the new library, called Fyyri, also relates back to its maritime heritage setting.</p>",

<h3>A UX carol</h3><h4>It was Christmas Eve, 2025, and like any other day, Ulysses Xavier was doom-scrolling LinkedIn.</h4><figure><img alt=""Stylized illustration titled “The Ghost of UX Past”: a nostalgic attic scene where a modern young man with a smartphone stands beside a seated person using an old desktop computer. A ghostly figure holding a book labeled “HTML” points at the retro screen displaying a hit counter for a website."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*nrlgpOj8kMplYupM.png"" /></figure><p>It was Christmas Eve, 2025, and like any other day, Ulysses Xavier was doom-scrolling LinkedIn.</p><p>Ulysses was a UX designer — or a “Product Designer,” or maybe a “Digital Experience Architect,” or a “Product Experience Manager,” depending on which day you asked him. Currently, however, he felt more like a Figma monkey. He sat in his Scandinavian designer chair, bathed in the orangey light of a dual-monitor setup (because you gotta filter out that blue light), reading yet another hot take about how AI had rendered his so-called career — which was kind of a joke, anyway — obsolete.</p><p>“Bah,” Ulysses muttered, quickly archiving yet another generic rejection email from a job application. “Humbug.”</p><p>He closed his eyes, wishing for the good old times when designers did all the user research and customer journeys by themselves. When he opened them, his MacBook and monitors were gone and his Spotify playlist “Coffee Shop Background Noises” replaced by the screeching, static-filled sound of a 28.8k modem connecting to the internet.</p><h3>The First of the Three Spirits</h3><p>Standing before him was an ethereal, slightly translucent figure dressed in flannel and holding a copy of <em>HTML for Dummies</em>.</p><p>“I am the Ghost of UX Past,” the figure said, its voice crackling like a 32-kbps RealAudio. “Come with me.”</p><p>Suddenly, Ulysses was back in 1995. He saw an attic. A solitary figure sat hunched over a CRT monitor, coding in what looked like a very old-school Apple Notes, typing on a keyboard that seemed way too clunky and loud.</p><p>“Is that ... a developer?” Ulysses asked.</p><p>“No,” the Ghost corrected. “That is Max. He’s what’s called a webmaster. In this era, there are no silos. He designs the page, writes the HTML, configures the server, and crops the JPEGs in Photoshop. He’s like a general contractor of the web.”​¹</p><p>Ulysses watched Max struggle. He was using invisible tables for layout because CSS didn’t really exist yet.² He was embedding headers as images because there were only a handful of fonts like Times New Roman and Courier available.³ It looked like a horrible mess … and painful.​</p><p>“It looks terrible,” Ulysses whispered, eyeing a blinking hit counter.</p><p>“It’s <em>foundational</em>,” the Ghost retorted. “There is nothing like ‘user experience’ yet — Don Norman has only started coining the term at Apple recently.⁴ But look at the ownership. Look at the freedom. There are no stakeholders blocking tickets. There’s just the creator and the user. It’s chaotic, yes. But it’s pure creative problem solving … well, maybe more creative than solving, to be fair.”​</p><p>“What is he using?” Ulysses asked. The ghost put a hand on his shoulder: “It’s called Notepad.”</p><p>Ulysses realized something. The constraints of the past — the technical limits, the lack of tools — forced immense creativity, even if the pages often seemed ugly. But these people weren’t just pushing (ugly) pixels; they were actually wrestling a giant squid.​</p><h3>The Second of the Three Spirits</h3><p>The scene dissolved into a sterile, open-plan office. Ulysses was sitting at a desk that looked like it rather belonged in a hospital. He noticed that on his monitor, there was a Zoom call with 45 participants.</p><p>“Am I … in a Zoom call … in an office? Why?”</p><p>“That’s the exact question I ask myself everyday … I’m the Ghost of UX Present, by the way,” sighed a weary figure who had appeared at his side, wearing a hoodie and looking noticeably burned out.</p><p>Ulysses looked around in confusion. He saw hundreds of designers churning out high-fidelity mockups in Figma, moving pixels by 4px increments. He saw their anxiety as Slack channels quickly filled with requests from stakeholders and management.</p><p>A couple of desks down, one of the designers was just laid off by his manager, “because revenue is bad and we have AI now to save costs.”</p><p>“Look at them,” the Ghost gestured. “They are terrified.”</p><p>Where the Ghost had gestured, Ulysses now saw analytics dashboards floating in the air like holographic projections. He couldn’t identify all the numbers<a href=""https://2008.maxspeicher.com/2022/09/26/steal-this-blog-post/"">,</a> because they seemed to be using Liquid Glass, but he saw the more than 250,000 tech layoffs from 2023.⁵ He saw the job market flooded with bootcamp graduates who had been promised secure and high-paying UX jobs.​⁶</p><p>“They feel like assembly line workers,” Ulysses said, recognizing the feeling. “Figma monkeys.”⁷</p><p>“Precisely,” the Ghost nodded. “They see product managers doing user research and creating wireframes. They see AI generating layouts faster than they can think. They are fighting for a seat at the table, but once they get there, they just take orders.”​⁸</p><p>The Ghost showed him a designer arguing with a stakeholder. The designer wanted to do discovery research; the stakeholder just wanted the screens done by Friday.</p><p>“We have become obsessed with the <em>artifacts</em> of design,” the Ghost said sadly. “Screens. Flows. Wireframes. We forgot that our job isn’t to make files. It’s to ensure the product works for the user. And because we act like factory workers, we are surprised when business treats us like a cost center to be optimized.”​</p><p>Ulysses felt a pit in his stomach. “Is this it? Is this how it ends? Replaced by AI, apathy, and alienation?”</p><h3>The Last of the Spirits</h3><p>The Zoom call and the office around it faded. Ulysses found himself in a quiet, sunlit room. There were no screens. No keyboards. Just people talking, gesturing, and collaborating. All of them were wearing tags: Human-Centered Product Manager, Interaction Systems Architect, Behavioral Product Strategist, Experience Integration Lead, and Cognitive Systems Engineer.</p><p>A tall, calm figure stood there. This Ghost didn’t look scary. It looked … Ulysses didn’t know how exactly, but maybe something like empowered?!</p><p>“I know what you think. You’ve looked at the job titles and now you think UX is dead,” the Ghost said. “But you are confusing the <em>title</em> with the <em>discipline</em>. We are all designers in one way or the other. I used to be called a ‘UX designer,’ but that was a long time ago.”</p><p>“Where are the screens?” Ulysses asked, looking for a laptop.</p><p>“Gone,” the Ghost smiled. “Or rather, the ideas of ‘screens’ and ‘average users’ are gone. Why would we design one interface on just 5 different screens, but for millions of users? The ‘average’ user never existed anyway.”</p><p>The Ghost waved a hand, and Ulysses saw a vision of the future:</p><h4>1. The End of the Screen (as we know it)</h4><p>“People here don’t draw pages,” the Ghost explained. “They define systems and constraints. They design components and the rules that govern them — ‘The header is always top,’ ‘Component A prioritizes over Component B,’ and so on. An AI takes those components and rules and generates hyper-personalized interfaces for every single user, adapted to their specific device and context.”</p><h4>2. The Designer as Educator</h4><p>Ulysses saw a Human-Centered Product Manager sitting with a Behavioral Product Strategist and a Cognitive Systems Engineer in what seemed to be a very intensive coaching session. “We stopped fighting the inevitable,” the Ghost said. “We embraced the fact that stakeholders, engineers, and product managers want — and need — to be involved in design. So we became force multipliers. We realized that — just like with research—you can’t prevent ‘non-designers’ from designing. But they need support and guidance to ensure the best outcome for the user. Now, our job is to empower <em>everyone</em> to solve their problems with the right design methods, so we can focus on the really wicked stuff and strategy. Oh, and you of course noticed already, but we all got new titles and merged with other disciplines, because in the end, <em>everything</em> is design and nobody understood UX correctly, anyway.”​</p><h4>3. The Death of the “Monkey Worker”</h4><p>“But what about AI?” Ulysses asked. “Did it replace us?”<br />“Obviously not. It replaced the monkey workers,” the Ghost answered firmly. “It replaced the rote production of UI assets. But it couldn’t replace the creative problem solving. Real designers aren’t monkey workers. They are strategic partners. The term ‘UX Designer’ might have vanished from job descriptions, merged into Product or Engineering, but the <em>practice</em> of UX is more vital than ever. Because one thing is for sure: there’ll always be users, and there’ll always be experiences.”</p><h3>The End of It</h3><p>Ulysses Xavier woke up with a start. The orangey light of his monitors seemed to hum softly.</p><p>He looked at his LinkedIn feed again. The doom-mongering articles were still there. The job market was still tough. But for the first time in months — maybe years — he didn’t feel cynical.</p><p>He realized that if he kept clinging to some kind of nostalgic understanding of UX from 1995, 2005, or 2015, he would indeed become a fossil. But if he embraced the shift? If he stopped designing screens for made-up personas that didn’t exist and started designing systems and strategy for an AI to build upon?</p><p>“UX isn’t dying,” Ulysses whispered to his empty room. “It’s merely growing up and finding a new identity.”</p><p>He sat up, opened LinkedIn Learning and typed: “How to build AI systems.” Then, he created a new document and began to jot down the concept for a proper design system for his websites.</p><p><em>Hi! 👋🏻 I’m </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximilianspeicher/""><em>Max</em></a><em>, a Product Design Director and Freelance Product Consultant with a Ph.D. in computer science.

<h4>AI didn’t create the craft crisis in design — it exposed the technical literacy gap that’s been eroding strategic influence for over a decade.</h4><figure><img alt=""Dylan Field at Figma 2024 Config"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RUyj6Nw2PozgI2F1o8ToIA.avif"" /><figcaption>Dylan Field at Figma 2024 Config (Source: <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/whats-happening-at-config-2024/"">Figma blog</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>At <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/whats-happening-at-config-2024/"">Figma’s Config 2024</a>, CEO Dylan Field stood before 10,000 designers and typed a simple prompt: <em>“A personal portfolio website for a sustainable Middle Earth architect.”</em> Seconds later, a complete UI layout materialized on screen. The crowd watched as Figma’s AI generated wireframes, layouts, and design systems from text prompts.</p><p>Field’s pitch was seductive: “In a world where more software is being created and reimagined because of AI, designing and building products is everyone’s business.”</p><p>Everyone’s business. The democratization promise we’ve heard before — this time powered by GPT-4o and Amazon’s image generators. Some features got huge reactions. The Rename Layers tool earned cheers. But on social media after the event, a different story emerged.</p><p>Designer <a href=""https://sdw.space/figma-ai-and-lost-jobs/"">Sebastiaan de With wrote</a> what many were thinking: “Figma AI will kill most — if not all — of these entry-level design jobs… if someone can simply get that poster (and 10 more like it) generated in a click, people will opt for that most of the time.” The anxiety wasn’t about the technology. It was about what the technology revealed: if AI can do your job with a text prompt, what exactly is your job?</p><p>Then came <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/02/figma-disables-its-ai-design-feature-that-appeared-to-be-ripping-off-apples-weather-app/"">the Apple Weather app incident</a>. Within days of launch, someone noticed Figma’s AI was generating designs that looked suspiciously like Apple’s Weather app. Not inspired by. Actually resembling. Field disabled the feature and admitted the company had rushed to hit a Config deadline. The feature relaunched months later as “First Draft,” with better guardrails.</p><p>But the damage was philosophical, not just technical. The promise of AI democratizing design ran headlong into a paradox nobody wanted to say out loud: these tools don’t make design accessible to everyone. They make design accessible to people who already understand what they’re looking at.</p><h3>The Paradox Nobody Mentions</h3><p>Here’s what actually happened when non-technical users got their hands on AI design tools.</p><p>In May 2025, accessibility expert <a href=""https://adrianroselli.com/2025/05/do-not-publish-your-designs-on-the-web-with-figma-sites.html"">Adrian Roselli tested Figma Sites</a> — the company’s new publish-to-web feature that promised to turn Figma designs into live websites. He ran automated tests on Figma’s own flagship demo sites. The results were brutal: <strong>210 WCAG violations</strong> on one demo site. Another had 107 violations. Images with no alt text. Contrast ratios failing basic accessibility standards. The HTML output was what Roselli called “div soup” — everything rendered as generic container elements, even headings and navigation.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot showing 210 WCAG accessibility violations detected in Figma Sites demo, with critical errors highlighted in red including missing alt text and contrast issues"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*u1udQD4giE_5_j7PMPHSBw.png"" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=""https://adrianroselli.com/2025/05/do-not-publish-your-designs-on-the-web-with-figma-sites.html"">Adrian Roselli</a>’s blogpost on Do Not Publish Your Designs on the Web with Figma Sites…</figcaption></figure><p>The technical implementation was worse. Drop caps were created using background-colored underscores, a technique that belonged in 1974 typewriter manuals, not modern web development. One commenter created a satirical video called “Introducing: Webbed Sites.” Another posted a reaction titled “Figma’s New Horrific DIV Generator.”</p><p>This wasn’t an AI training problem. This was an expertise problem masquerading as a democratization tool. Figma Sites generated technically valid HTML that was utterly inappropriate for actual use. If you don’t know why that’s a problem, the tool won’t help you. If you do know why it’s a problem, you probably wouldn’t use the tool.</p><p>The pattern repeated across every AI design tool that launched in 2024–2025. V0 by Vercel produced code that stopped mid-generation. Users reported the AI losing context and forgetting previous work. Bolt.new earned a 1.5-star rating on Trustpilot, with users reporting they spent over a thousand dollars in tokens just trying to fix code problems. One developer burned through 20 million tokens on a single authentication issue. Critical files went missing. Projects deployed with blank screens.</p><p>Claude Code, despite being one of the more capable AI coding tools, experienced performance degradation so severe that GitHub users reported 30–40% drops in development speed. Tasks that previously took one day required two or three. The most telling detail: Anthropic had to publish an official postmortem admitting infrastructure bugs caused the AI to produce broken code with odd characters.</p><p>And then there was <a href=""https://techstartups.com/2025/05/24/builder-ai-a-microsoft-backed-ai-startup-once-valued-at-1-2-billion-files-for-bankruptcy-is-ai-becoming-another-com-bubble/"">Builder.ai</a> — the cautionary tale everyone should study. Valued at $1.5 billion with backing from Microsoft and Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, Builder.ai promised AI-powered app development. The company employed over 1,500 people and raised $445 million. In May 2025, it filed for bankruptcy. The reason? The “AI” was actually 700 Indian engineers manually coding everything. The Wall Street Journal had exposed this back in 2019, but the company limped along for six more years. Enterprise clients experienced apps crashing under basic user loads. A former employee later joked that the “AI” stood for “Another Indian.”</p><p>The paradox crystalizes: tools marketed as democratization require <em>more</em> technical knowledge than traditional workflows, not less. You need to understand prompt engineering, debug AI-generated output, recognize when the AI is hallucinating, and know enough about technical constraints to evaluate whether what the AI produces is actually feasible.</p><p>We told ourselves AI would level the playing field. Instead, it raised the floor. If you can’t tell the difference between functional code and broken code, between accessible design and inaccessible design, between scalable architecture and technical debt, these tools just let you fail faster.</p><h3>How We Got Here</h3><p>The craft crisis didn’t start with AI. AI just made it impossible to ignore.</p><p>Somewhere in the early 2010s, the design industry made a collective decision: designers don’t need to code. <a href=""https://mralancooper.medium.com/should-designers-code-cde3ef9d6621"">Alan Cooper</a>, the father of Visual Basic and interaction design pioneer, wrote definitively that coding wasn’t necessary for top-notch designers. Design Thinking became the dominant framework, emphasizing empathy and process over technical craft. Design bootcamps proliferated with promises of career changes in six months, explicitly advertising that no coding knowledge was required.</p><p><a href=""https://designlab.com/blog/google-ux-design-certificate-on-coursera-is-it-worth-it"">Google’s UX Certificate</a> on Coursera states clearly: “UX design requires no knowledge of coding.” For $300 and six months at 10 hours per week, you could become a UX designer. Bootcamps charged $10,000 for 12-week programs focused on wireframing, prototyping, and user research — not technical implementation.</p><p>This wasn’t gatekeeping by engineers. This was the design industry telling itself a story about what designers needed to know. The story went like this: designers focus on users, empathy, and problem-solving. Engineers focus on implementation, code, and technical constraints. Clean separation of concerns. Everyone stays in their lane.</p><h3>What we lost wasn’t the ability to code. What we lost was the ability to participate in technical conversations.</h3><p>Understanding why an API limitation makes a feature infeasible. Recognizing when performance constraints should influence design decisions. Knowing enough about technical debt to engage in build-versus-buy discussions. Being able to evaluate whether AI-generated code actually works or just looks like it works.</p><p><a href=""https://rogerwong.me/2025/07/design-talent-crisis"">Roger Wong</a>, analyzing the design talent crisis in 2025, put it bluntly: entry-level designers at Big Tech now represent just 7% of all hires — a 50% drop from 2019. How do designers develop taste, craft, and strategic thinking without doing the foundational work? The industry created a pipeline that produces designers who can talk about empathy but can’t evaluate technical trade-offs.</p><figure><img alt=""Bar chart showing tech industry layoffs from 2020–2024, with peak layoffs of 167,000 in Q1 2023 and 150,000+ layoffs continuing through 2024"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dkXedIBWDnc8-94nlUD-Kw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=""https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-the-major-tech-layoffs-in-2024-so-far/"">https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-the-major-tech-layoffs-in-2024-so-far/</a></figcaption></figure><p>The consequences show up everywhere. <a href=""https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/10-ways-to-improve-design-to-development-handoff/"">UXPin research</a> found that 62% of developers spend significant time redoing designs due to communication breakdowns. Not because designers made bad aesthetic choices. Because designers proposed things that were technically nonsensical, or missed constraints that would have changed the entire approach.</p><p>A designer proposes a feature without understanding that it requires a new API endpoint, which requires backend changes, which requires database migrations, which means a three-month timeline instead of a three-week timeline. The feature gets de-scoped or killed. The designer learns their proposals aren’t strategic input — they’re suggestions engineers will simplify into whatever is actually buildable.</p><p>This happened so many times, in so many companies, that it became the pattern. Designers create mockups. Engineers override them based on technical constraints the designer didn’t know existed. The designer spends days in “alignment meetings” trying to advocate for the user, but can’t speak the technical language needed to actually influence the decision. Business stakeholders step in to make product calls because they can at least understand the technical constraints, even if they don’t understand users.</p><p><a href=""https://designsystems.international/ideas/product-design-is-lost/"">Rune Madsen</a>, in his essay “Product Design Is Lost,” captured this perfectly: designers found themselves “in a place between strategy and implementation, yet they are not fully empowered to influence either.” We’re filling our time with checklists instead of focusing on the very thing that makes designers relevant. We’ve been painted into a corner.</p><p>The industry did this to itself. And we called it progress.</p><h3>Why This Matters Now</h3><p>Here’s the part that makes designers defensive: we lost influence long before AI showed up. AI just exposed the gap.</p><p>The “Great Design Handoff” wasn’t a single event — it was a slow erosion of strategic control. Growth teams took over conversion optimization. Algorithms dictated layout and personalization. Business stakeholders made product decisions. Design leaders found themselves defending the existence of their teams rather than shaping product strategy.</p><p>The evidence is everywhere. <a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/90976682/design-giant-ideo-cuts-a-third-of-staff-and-closes-offices-as-the-era-of-design-thinking-ends"">IDEO</a> — the company that popularized Design Thinking — lost half its headcount between 2020 and 2025. Revenue dropped from $300 million to $100 million. Google laid off over 100 designers in November 2024, cutting some cloud design teams in half. IBM eliminated its chief design officer position entirely. Autodesk cut 1,350 employees in December 2024. Across tech, <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3816662/tech-layoffs-in-2024-a-timeline.html"">150,000+ jobs disappeared in 2024</a> alone.</p><p>But here’s the telling detail: only one major company hired a chief design officer in the second half of 2023. PayPal. That’s it. Executive-level design roles are disappearing across corporate America, and it’s not because AI replaced them. It’s because the roles stopped delivering strategic value.</p><p><a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/91027996/the-big-design-freak-out-a-generation-of-design-leaders-grapple-with-their-future"">Fast Company reported</a> on a March 2024 conference where design leaders from P&amp;G, Ford, Verizon, GE Healthcare, and other Fortune 500 companies confronted the question directly: “Is Design Dead?” The consensus wasn’t about AI. It was about business priorities. Design has been deprioritized during a business cycle championing technology and marketing.</p><p>Netflix provides the clearest case study. Eighty percent of all viewing hours come from algorithmic recommendations. The homepage layout, row ordering, and even the thumbnails users see are determined by algorithms, not designers. Netflix’s personalization saves over a billion dollars per year in subscriber retention. When the business case is that strong, design becomes an execution function serving algorithmic strategy.</p><p>Growth teams present a similar challenge. <a href=""https://andrewchen.com/how-to-build-a-growth-team/"">Andrew Chen</a>, a prominent growth expert, notes that growth teams work best when they can run lightweight experiments quickly. Design-conscious companies resist this because their incentives reward large, complex projects rather than many small changes. So growth teams route around design, making decisions that move metrics even when they compromise user experience. Princeton found that <a href=""https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/dark-patterns-examples"">1 in 10 of 11,000 shopping sites</a> used dark patterns. Zurich University found 95% of popular Android apps had at least one dark pattern. The European Commission found 97% of apps used by EU consumers contained dark patterns.</p><p>These aren’t isolated bad actors. These are systemic outcomes when growth imperatives override design principles, and designers lack the technical fluency to advocate effectively in those conversations.</p><p>The root cause is simple: most product decisions are fundamentally technical. They involve technical constraints, technical trade-offs, technical debt, and technical feasibility. If you can’t participate in technical conversations, you can’t influence product strategy. You can’t influence product strategy, you end up in alignment meetings explaining user needs to people making technical decisions you don’t fully understand.</p><p>This is why the handoff happened. Not because AI replaced designers. Because designers couldn’t articulate why technical decisions should consider user impact in language that resonated with the people making those decisions.</p><h3>This Isn’t About Coding</h3><p>Let me be crystal clear: this is not an argument that designers should learn to code production software.</p><p>This is about strategic literacy. Understanding enough about technical systems to make informed design decisions and advocate effectively for users when those decisions are being made.</p><p>There’s a difference between writing production code and understanding what code does. Between implementing a database schema and knowing why data models influence user workflows. Between configuring a build pipeline and recognizing when technical debt is accumulating in ways that will limit future design possibilities.</p><p>Strategic literacy means you can:</p><ul><li>Evaluate whether AI-generated code is functional or broken</li><li>Understand API constraints well enough to design features that are actually feasible</li><li>Recognize when performance implications should influence interaction patterns</li><li>Participate in technical debt conversations because you understand what’s being traded off</li><li>Spot when “technical constraints” are actually implementation choices masquerading as limitations</li></ul><p>The design engineers who maintained influence through the 2024–2025 crisis weren’t necessarily writing backend services. But they understood technical systems deeply enough to design with constraints in mind, advocate for users in technical conversations, and ship work that didn’t require wholesale engineering rewrites.</p><p><a href=""https://vercel.com/blog/design-engineering-at-vercel"">Rauno Freiberg at Vercel</a> describes his role as providing “the Design team with Engineering firepower to lead and ship our own projects end-to-end.” <a href=""https://ui.land/interviews/paco-coursey"">Paco Coursey at Linear</a> says design and code don’t feel separate to him. These aren’t people who abandoned design for engineering. They’re people who refused to treat design as separate from implementation.</p><p>The counter-argument is always gatekeeping: requiring technical knowledge excludes people from design. But what actually excludes people is creating a professional track that leads to strategic irrelevance. Roger Wong’s research shows entry-level hiring has collapsed. Matt Ström warns that if we don’t train junior designers now, we’ll have no senior designers for complex work AI can’t do. Design Week points out that students aren’t being equipped with essential technical skills.</p><p>We told designers they didn’t need technical knowledge. Then we eliminated their jobs when they couldn’t influence technical decisions. That’s not inclusion. That’s malpractice.</p><p>The question isn’t whether designers should code. The question is whether designers should understand the medium they’re designing for. Whether they should be able to evaluate their own work. Whether they should have enough technical fluency to advocate for users when technical decisions are being made.</p><p>That’s the baseline for strategic relevance.</p><h3>What Changes</h3><p>The opportunity here is clearer than the design industry wants to admit: technical understanding is learnable, and the designers who develop it will have influence that others don’t.</p><p>Look at what technical literacy enables. <a href=""https://www.bbva.com/en/airbnb-design-thinking-success-story/"">At Airbnb</a>, a designer studying the star rating system realized replacing stars with hearts could feel more personal. That design change increased bookings by more than 30%. Not because the designer had great visual taste. Because the designer understood the technical system well enough to identify a high-leverage intervention.</p><p>At <a href=""https://medium.com/@broccolini/design-systems-at-github-c8e5378d2542"">GitHub</a>, designers contribute production code to the Primer design system. They don’t do this because they want to be engineers. They do it because understanding the technical implementation makes them better designers. They can prototype with real constraints, collaborate with engineers as peers, and ship work that actually functions.</p><p>Vercel’s design engineering team operates with “aesthetic sensibility with technical skills,” which allows them to “deeply understand a problem, then design, build, and ship a solution autonomously.” This isn’t a replacement for traditional design — it’s an expansion of what design can influence.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Vercel’s design engineering"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3IIzfKxMtEWgJwU93GFyaw.png"" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=""https://vercel.com/blog/design-engineering-at-vercel"">https://vercel.com/blog/design-engineering-at-vercel</a></figcaption></figure><p>The technical skills that matter most:</p><ul><li>Understanding data models and how they constrain user workflows</li><li>Knowing enough about APIs to design technically feasible features</li><li>Recognizing performance bottlenecks that should influence interaction patterns</li><li>Evaluating AI-generated outputs for technical correctness</li><li>Understanding how design systems map to component libraries</li><li>Participating in build-versus-buy discussions with actual technical context</li></ul><p>None of this requires a computer science degree. It requires curiosity about how things actually work and a willingness to learn technical fundamentals.</p><p>The designers maintaining strategic influence through 2024–2025 aren’t the ones with the best Figma skills. They’re the ones who can participate in technical conversations, evaluate trade-offs, and advocate for users in language that resonates with engineers and product leaders.</p><p>This is the path forward. Not back to “designers should code” debates from the 2010s. Forward to “designers should understand the systems they’re designing for” as a baseline professional expectation.</p><h3>The Reckoning</h3><p>When Figma’s AI generated Apple Weather app clones, it revealed that many designers couldn’t articulate what made a design original beyond surface aesthetics. When Figma Sites produced <a href=""https://adrianroselli.com/2025/05/do-not-publish-your-designs-on-the-web-with-figma-sites.html"">210 WCAG violations</a>, it showed that accessibility knowledge wasn’t widespread enough to catch obviously broken output. <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/ai-generated-ux-and-the-growing-accessibility-debt-how-to-fix-it-8109fda7d9d5"">Research shows</a> that 81% of homepages have low-contrast text, and when AI trains on this data, it perpetuates systemic exclusion. When Builder.ai collapsed after six years of pretending AI was doing what engineers actually did, it demonstrated how easy it is to fake technical competence in an industry that stopped valuing technical craft.</p><p>The designers who maintained influence through this period share one thing: technical depth. Not necessarily coding ability, but deep understanding of technical systems. They can evaluate AI output. They can participate in architecture discussions. They can advocate for users in technical terms that actually influence decisions.</p><p>The designers who lost influence — and there were many, given 150,000+ layoffs — often shared a different trait: they treated design as separate from implementation. They created mockups for engineers to “build.” They relied on tools without understanding outputs. They couldn’t evaluate technical trade-offs or participate meaningfully in technical conversations.</p><p>The question facing the industry isn’t whether AI will replace designers. It’s whether designers will develop the technical literacy needed to remain strategically relevant in a world where most product decisions are fundamentally technical.</p><p>Some will argue this sets the bar too high. That requiring technical understanding excludes people. But what actually excludes people is creating a professional track that leads to irrelevance. Entry-level hiring has collapsed. Design leadership roles are disappearing. The “Great Design Handoff” already happened, and it wasn’t to AI — it was to growth teams, algorithms, and business stakeholders who could at least speak the technical language of trade-offs and constraints.</p><figure><img alt=""A venn diagram showing what is design engineering."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pQ35G-p558gX5yK0L8l1gQ.avif"" /><figcaption>Image Source: <a href=""https://maggieappleton.com/design-engineers"">https://maggieappleton.com/design-engineers</a></figcaption></figure><p>The industry told designers they didn’t need to understand implementation.

<h4><em>WCAG color contrast is more than just text</em></h4><p>Most designers know the basics of web accessibility and color contrast. We’ve memorized that “normal text” (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html#dfn-large-scale"">24 CSS pixels and below</a>) needs to meet a 4.5:1 contrast ratio with its background, and “large text” (greater than 24 CSS pixels) needs to meet a 3:1 ratio.</p><p><strong>But WCAG (</strong><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/""><strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</strong></a><strong>) color contrast requirements don’t stop at text.</strong> There are lesser known WCAG success criteria (or “rules”) that are still very important for inclusive design; these ensure interfaces are usable to users with low vision or color blindness.</p><figure><img alt=""Viewing YouTube’s homepage with different vision simulations, like red-green color blindness and sun-glare"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-l5gevfqLDE88Ha5TisA6g.png"" /><figcaption>Viewing YouTube’s homepage with different vision simulations, like red-green color blindness</figcaption></figure><p>Some of these forgotten requirements circle around UI components, inline links, and data visualizations, which all have color contrast rules of their own. When these details are overlooked, users can’t tell what’s interactive, what’s linked, or what the data is actually saying (even if all the text uses accessible colors).</p><p>And these accessibility gaps aren’t edge cases. They show up in mature Design Systems, enterprise products, and well-intentioned designs because they live outside the accessibility standards designers tend to learn and adopt.</p><p>To avoid these gaps for the future, let’s go over 3 ongoing color contrast issues, how WCAG applies beyond text, and who exactly is impacted by color contrast.</p><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: I reference WCAG 2.1, Level AA standards. If your product needs to comply with Level AAA, required color contrast ratios increase (i.e., </em><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-enhanced.html""><em>normal text needs a 7:1 ratio</em></a><em> with its background).</em></blockquote><h3>UI components that look accessible (but aren’t)</h3><p>WCAG criteria: <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html"">SC 1.4.11: Non-Text Contrast (Level AA)</a></p><p>In plain english, this WCAG criteria requires that non-text UI elements that are interactive or communicate meaning have a <strong>minimum of 3:1 contrast ratio</strong> against adjacent colors (like the UI background).</p><p>But what is covered by “UI elements”? Basically, anything that a user can interact with or needs to see to use; such as:</p><ul><li>Buttons and button states</li><li>Form fields and their borders</li><li>Checkboxes, radio buttons, and toggles</li><li>Focus indicators</li><li>Icons that convey meaning or affordance</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Spirit includes text fields that do not meet contrast requirements with a 1.6:1 ratio"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mzlbjZWOHK27EOSS3N1QaQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.spirit.com/flight-status""><em>Spirit</em></a><em> includes text fields that do not meet contrast requirements with a 1.6:1 ratio; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong>Important note</strong><em>: If color contrast fails WCAG standards from the Design System level, the failure is replicated across all product adopters; it’s critical to check system UI component’s color contrast.</em></blockquote><h4>What designers miss and why it matters</h4><p>This is where many designs that are intended to be accessible quietly fail. Since these UI elements don’t contain text, they’re excluded from color contrast checks. And yes, text is very important to check, but so are the UI elements that provide any product its functionality.</p><p><strong>Common gaps within UI elements include:</strong></p><ul><li>Input borders that blend into the product background</li><li>Custom focus indicators that rely on subtle color shifts instead of high-contrast</li><li>Icon-only controls (like buttons) that don’t meet contrast on their own</li></ul><p><strong>When UI elements lack minimum contrast, users can’t reliably:</strong></p><ul><li>Identify what’s interactive or understand UI component states (like hover)</li><li>Navigate interfaces using only their keyboard</li><li>Complete forms without repetitive errors</li></ul><figure><img alt=""BBC includes a primary CTA that meets contrast requirements with a 4.58:1 ratio"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9lBpa8t8UhfH8HfsgOkvOQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.bbc.com/""><em>BBC</em></a><em> includes a primary CTA that meets contrast requirements with a 4.58:1 ratio; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><h4>Who are the users impacted?</h4><p>Though low-contrast UI elements affect everyone at some capacity (you might have to do some squinting), they make products unusable to people like:</p><ul><li>Users with low vision who need distinct visual styling</li><li>Keyboard users who depend on focus indicators that stand-out on the UI</li><li>Older users experiencing reduced contrast sensitivity</li><li>Users in low-contrast environments (i.e., sun-glare, small screens, fluorescent lights)</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: To check a UI component’s contrast (or any element that needs contrast), you can also use </em><a href=""https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-disability-simulator/olioanlbgbpmdlgjnnampnnlohigkjla?hl=en&amp;pli=1""><em>Web Disability Simulator</em></a><em> on any web page to simulate how it looks for users with color-blindness or cognitive disabilities.</em></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Red-green color blind simulation on YouTube with the Web Disability Simulator Chrome extension"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QWZyIWC5rf7neuUBx-RhKQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Red-green color blind simulation on </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/""><em>YouTube</em></a><em> with the </em><a href=""https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-disability-simulator/olioanlbgbpmdlgjnnampnnlohigkjla?hl=en&amp;pli=1""><em>Web Disability Simulator</em></a><em> Chrome extension</em></figcaption></figure><h3>Data visualizations with low contrast</h3><p>WCAG criteria: <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html"">SC 1.4.11: Non-Text Contrast (Level AA)</a></p><p>This accessibility gap references the same WCAG standard as UI components from above. But though data visualizations (data viz) may not always be interactive, they’re communicating meaningful information. Because of this, data viz must be perceivable without relying only on color and must meet a <strong>minimum 3:1 contrast ratio</strong> against adjacent colors.</p><p>This standard applies to:</p><ul><li>Chart lines, bars, and segments</li><li>Data points and markers</li><li>Axes, gridlines, or any reference lines that convey meaning</li><li>Legends or other visual keys</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Datylon includes a pie chart example that does not meet contrast requirements with a 1:1 ratio"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1OTh5HfA1C-vKeF7ZsJWag.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.datylon.com/resources/chart-library/pie-chart""><em>Datylon</em></a><em> includes a pie chart example that does not meet contrast requirements with a 1:1 ratio; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><h4>What designers miss and why it matters</h4><p>Data viz is an already complex and complicated UI element, so it’s even more difficult to bake in accessibility guidelines (especially if it’s being retrofitted). But color contrast issues are frequently found in charts and heatmaps that use the brand’s color palette rather than accessibility-tested colors.</p><p><strong>Common issues with data viz include:</strong></p><ul><li>Chart colors that are distinguishable in isolation but fail 3:1 contrast when touching one another</li><li>Data series using colors that aren’t distinguishable for color-blind users (i.e., red-green)</li><li>Thin gridlines with low contrast that disappear against the background</li><li>Charts that use multiple colors without secondary text indicators</li><li>Legends that depend on matching colors instead of labels or patterns</li></ul><p><strong>When data viz lack contrast and use color alone, users can’t:</strong></p><ul><li>Clearly and quickly understand trends in the data set</li><li>Confidently compare data without the feeling of guessing</li><li>Lose access to critical insights (especially when the data isn’t provided in another way)</li></ul><h4>Who are the users impacted?</h4><p>Again, all users are affected on some level by low contrast data viz. But other users need to be considered when designing the different types of charts so they can perceive and comprehend the same information as everyone else.</p><p>Some of these users include:</p><ul><li>Color-blind users (especially those with red-green color blindness)</li><li>Users with low vision who need high contrast for visual distinction</li><li>Users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from redundant cues</li><li>Users viewing charts on small screens or in poor lighting</li></ul><figure><img alt=""IBM Carbon includes a pie chart example that meets contrast requirements with a 7.76:1 ratio"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_Gsff7Yx_6gvh6DmjX7Djg.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://carbondesignsystem.com/data-visualization/simple-charts/#pie""><em>IBM Carbon</em></a><em> includes a pie chart example that meets contrast requirements with a 7.76:1 ratio; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: Simply by adding a white border between data viz elements, the colors become more distinguishable and meet accessibility guidelines.</em></blockquote><h3>Inline links that rely on low contrast color</h3><p>WCAG criteria: <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color.html"">SC 1.4.1: Use of Color (Level A)</a></p><p>Color cannot be the only visual means used to indicate a link on a web page. But not only that, inline links also must have <strong>at least 3:1 contrast</strong> against surrounding body text to be distinguishable (especially when the link doesn’t have an additional visual cue, <a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/F73.html"">like an underline or bold font weight</a>).</p><figure><img alt=""Atlanta’s Department of Transportation includes inline links that do not meet contrast requirements with a 1.58:1 ratio"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*k_84e7wKBM0IOAXis1ljeA.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://atldot.atlantaga.gov/""><em>Atlanta’s Department of Transportation</em></a><em> includes inline links that do not meet contrast requirements with a 1.58:1 ratio; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><h4>What designers miss and why it matters</h4><p>Inline links are such simple and subtle UI components; it’s easy to miss the checks needed to ensure accessibility. Designers typically think that since a paragraph of text meets the 4.5:1 color ratio requirement, any inline link using the same text color within the paragraph also passes. Since links are interactive elements, they have additional guidelines other than passing the color requirements for text.</p><p><strong>Frequent issues with inline links include:</strong></p><ul><li>Links that are differentiated only by an underline when the link receive mouse hover or keyboard focus</li><li>Link colors that meet contrast against the background, but not against adjacent text</li><li>Underlines removed for aesthetic or simplicity reasons</li></ul><p><strong>When inline links aren’t clearly distinguishable, users can’t:</strong></p><ul><li>Easily comprehend what’s interactive (especially when hidden in body copy)</li><li>Efficiently navigate a website or product page</li><li>Find important actions or information they need to complete a task</li></ul><h4>Who are the users impacted?</h4><p>I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again… this affects all users at some capacity. Inline links are not as recognizable to any user when the underline affordance or high contrast color is taken away. But for some users, it becomes impossible to identify links that could lead the user to information or product pages they need.</p><p>Users to consider when designing inline links include:</p><ul><li>Color-blind users who may not perceive color differences</li><li>Users with low vision who require visual affordances with high contrast</li><li>Users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from consistent patterns</li><li>All users scanning content quickly</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: A simple rule of thumb is to make a link look like a link for optimal usability and accessibility.</em></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Gov.UK includes inline links that meets contrast requirements with a 3.81:1 ratio AND are underlined"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3rOPtaAXaJBwGlfl3wKXcg.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid""><em>Gov.UK</em></a><em> includes inline links that meets contrast requirements with a 3.81:1 ratio AND are underlined; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>UI components, inline links, and data visualizations often fall outside the mental checklist of color contrast and accessible design.</strong> WCAG covers these elements, but it’s often overlooked when focusing on adequate contrast for text. This leads to websites and interfaces that look high contrast, but are near impossible to use for some user groups.</p><p>By spreading awareness to these accessibility gaps, we can expand how we define color contrast and better apply ideal accessibility practices. When these requirements are built into components, patterns, and Design Systems from the start, accessibility stops being a last-minute fix (or remediation plan) and becomes part of the design process.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=68cc224735b3"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/3-color-contrast-mistakes-designers-still-make-68cc224735b3"">3 color contrast mistakes designers still make</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Tiny, deliberate white spots stretch from base to tip on a brushed brown background, creating a deer-hide effect that perfectly nods to the winter season.

<p>It was only a matter of time before our iced coffee obsession made its way to our nails — and this look by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRcoHkmkXYV/?hl=en"">nail tech Elizabeth</a> is nothing short of incredible. It starts with a bronze cat-eye base, manipulated with magnets to achieve a glassy finish, followed by a matte top coat. Then, fine lines are painted on top using a glossy top coat to create a striking contrast effect.</p>

<p>Just hit the Explore page on Instagram, and it’ll become clear: baby blue and chocolate brown are the unexpected color combination of 2026 — and we’re here for it. There’s a ’70s retro vibe to the pairing, but it works effortlessly. Created by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DOB6k9NCF7E/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Heather Errington</a>, this pastel blue heart layered over a molten chocolate base is so cool.</p>

<p>Taking cues from A/W runways, plaid nails are everywhere, but velvet plaid — essentially plaid layered over a velvety cat-eye base — is what’s bringing the intricate pattern into 2026. Thanks to the mix of polish finishes, the effect is beautifully multidimensional.

<p>Hair artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tomsmithhd/?hl=en"">Tom Smith</a> describes the varsity bob as a choppy, chin-skimming cut with subtle layers and a center part. The inspo? <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stxph.h/?hl=en"">Steph Hui</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/milliebobbybrown/?hl=en"">Millie Bobby Brown</a>. “Polished but never prissy, it carries a cool collegiate energy — youthful without being childish and preppy without being stiff,” says Smith. While the movement might look undone, it’s actually intentional and well-maintained, adds Smith, thanks to the invisible layers through the mid-lengths and ends that create that flicky volume.</p>

<p>“Gucci bangs feel very fashion-forward — and powerful,” says celebrity hairstylist and colorist, Dimitris Giannetos. He recalls creating the softly-parted, slightly grown-out look for <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPCbqhRCcFf/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Demi Moore</a> ahead of her role as the fictional character Barbara Gucci in the short film <a href=""https://www.gucci.com/uk/en_gb/ms/short-film/video/?srsltid=AfmBOoqmlK5X6LGynFA07QzQ_cV-MEN9asH5aMoAgw1q-0w5QmEfs8ve""><em>The Tiger</em></a><em>.</em> “To achieve this look, ask for wispy curtain bangs just below the brows with face-framing pieces towards the ears,” recommends Giannetos. The key? “Avoid a blunt cut by adding some variety to the length of the bangs across the face,” he says.</p>

<p>“<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRwqKtLkWkX/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Anok Yai</a>’s striking short bob, complete with a blunt fringe, highlights the boldness of this style,” says celebrity hairdresser <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lorraine_dublin/?hl=en"">Lorraine Dublin</a>. “It’s a sharp, chin-skimming bob paired with a clean fringe, and it’s set to stand out this winter.” Why? It has a strong, modern silhouette, Dublin explains, yet still feels polished and low-maintenance.

The ripped bob, however, is a more interesting, layered take, thanks to softly separated ends created with a texturizing technique where the hair is chopped into vertically. This cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DFiwwTohOJ6/?hl=en"">Catherine Gibbs</a> is perfect.</p>

<p>The shag is set to take on a much gentler image in 2026, according to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/neale.rodger/?hl=en"">Neale Rodger</a>, style director at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stil.salon/reels/?hl=en"">STIL salon</a> in London. “Think soft, feathered layers that build volume and create easy movement,” says Rodger, like this look by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DQ8UfaOEZwa/?hl=en"">Ryenne Snow</a>. Rodger adds that it’s the kind of cut that still looks intentional even as it grows out. “It’s a brilliant choice for medium to thick hair,” continues Rodger, “especially if there’s already some natural wave or texture to play with.” Guiding your stylist is simple: “Ask for feathered layers throughout, soft ends, and a length that sits somewhere between the neck and shoulders,” advises Rodger.</p>

<p>The ’70s have had their time in the sun. Now, it’s 1960’s time to shine, and bangs are leading the resurgence, says <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/rickyandthe64/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ricky Walters</a>, founder and creative director of <a href=""https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/kDPwCAD7OkS1gz3BSGfnFGBjS0?domain=instagram.com"">Salon 64</a>. “The new incarnation is all about boldness: think thick, heavy, statement-making fringes taken surprisingly far back into the crown,” says Walters. He adds, “This isn’t a whisper of a fringe; it’s a full-volume curtain that instantly reshapes the face, adding drama, mystery, and a touch of French-girl rebellion.” Walters says that cutting it with plenty of density — adding bulk through techniques like point cutting and texturizing — prevents it from slipping into anything too dated.

<p>The power pixie has <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DKC7SdkIV8j/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Florence Pugh</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/glennclose/?hl=en"">Glenn Close</a>, and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lirisaw/?hl=en"">Iris Law</a> to thank for its meteoric rise. “This is a cropped, layered pixie that’s sharp, sculpted, and deliberately androgynous,” says Smith. Its key characteristics? “Enough length and the top and front to allow for versatile styling,” adds Smith, who calls it the ultimate anti-blowout style. “This is great for finer hair types and those who want more lift, as it helps to contour the jawline and cheekbones when long enough to be tucked behind the ears,” says Smith. Asking for it couldn’t be simpler: “Ask for close layering and texture that can shift from matte and punkish by day to polished and glossy at night,” advises Smith — and don’t forget the longer, swooping bangs.</p>

<p>The name sounds complicated, but the result speaks for itself. It’s essentially a soft blowout with rounded, bouncy ends, explains Giannetos, who recently debuted the look on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPfNBxrAm_i/?img_index=1"">Amal Clooney</a>. “It works well on long, layered hair, about 6-8 inches from the shoulder. This look enhances body, adds movement, and makes the blowout feel thicker and more voluminous,” says Giannetos. “I like to take a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbioionic.com%2Fproducts%2Flong-barrel-curling-iron%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOop4ikEqvaTUTaxG4jDAYCjJnatn52afqSSXogJ4hCj1l_BzoThO"">1.25” Bio Ionic Curler</a> to the ends to lock in the rounded shape.”</p>

<p>The shaggy bob is not only effortlessly chic, says Dublin, but it’s practical for winter and spring. “The layers add movement and texture — great under scarves or hats — while still looking polished for work or evening plans,” adds Dublin. Grab a hydrating hair cream like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fpalo-santo-styling-cream-for-curly-coily-hair-P514454"">PATTERN by Tracee Ellis Ross Palo Santo Styling Cream</a> and let your natural texture do its thing.

<p>Mussed-up texture is in this season, says Stenson, and while the classic shag’s layering technique is making a comeback, it’s being reimagined for 2026 with modern softness and volume. “Even better, it’s flexible across hair types,” he adds. “A shag is great for anyone with thick hair because it removes weight and bulk. If you have finer hair, ask for a modern micro-shag or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/07/10604094/wolf-cut-hair-style"">wolf-shag</a> with strategic layering that adds volume and texture without making the hair look sparse,” advises Stenson.

<p>“The textured lob [aka long bob] will continue its quiet takeover,” says Rodger. “It’s mid-length, slightly undone, and effortlessly cool — the kind of cut that behaves beautifully through winter,” he adds. It’s also a seasonal all-rounder, and easy to air-dry in the warmer months, too. “I love how it slips under scarves and coats without losing shape, and it gives hair that natural, lived-in movement,” continues Rodger, who says it’s perfect for wavy and lightly curly hair. “Ask your stylist for a neck-to-shoulder graze with feathered, textured ends, and a soft, natural finish,” suggests Rodger.

<p>The 2026 update is lighter than its previous counterpart, says Walters, and it sits in what he refers to as the magic zone: “Just above the collarbone and never shorter than the jawline,” adds Walters, like this cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DL7RI9nTj3h/?img_index=1"">Miho Mai</a>. “This sweet spot creates a clean, graphic silhouette without sacrificing softness.” What gives it a modern edge is the invisible layering: “These are subtle, sliced-in shorter pieces hidden underneath,” says Walters. “These secret layers act like built-in movement, allowing the bob to swing, breathe, and catch the light in all the right ways.”</p>

<p>If they’re not cut properly, curtain bangs can look blocky and unnatural, failing to blend into the rest of your lengths. That’s why Stenson suggests asking for “texturized” curtain bangs. Texturized bangs are cut with techniques that soften the fringe and remove bulk, so they fall more naturally. “Your stylist will assess the density of your hair to ensure your bangs are proportionate to your face,” says Stenson. “Bangs are especially a great choice for those with fine or thin hair and looking to bring some volume to their look. They’re truly versatile enough to suit all face shapes.” Take inspiration from this cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DHXGOA8RxGH/?hl=en"">@charlottexstyles</a> on Instagram.</p>

<p>Gianettos says that there’s something so chic about a sharp bob that grazes the chin and that it can elevate any outfit. “It feels very confident, effortless, cool-girl,” says Giannetos. “It can be worn wavy for an everyday style or straight for a very sleek, edgy look,” — much like this cut on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DE3nIljNoix/?hl=en&amp;img_index=3"">Meredith Duxbury</a>. “I like to use <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fadvanced-hairstyle-sleek-it-iron-straight-heatspray-pimprod2046287%3Fsku%3D2629284"">L’Oreal Paris’ Sleek It Iron Straight Hairspray</a> to tame any frizz that distracts from the moment,” says Giannetos. </p>

<p>The bixie — bob meets pixie — is heading into 2026 with us, and for good reason: it’s soft, wearable, and short enough to feel fresh, says Rodger. “This is a sweet spot between a bob and a pixie, and it’s ideal for anyone tempted to go shorter without committing to a full pixie,” says Rodger. He adds that it works especially well on fine to medium hair, which always benefits from added texture through the mid-lengths and ends. “When you’re asking for it in the chair, think chin length or slightly above, with light, choppy layers and a soft, airy finish.” We love this crop by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DKmqHaSxsQ2/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Chellsie Aiger Serrano</a>.</p>

<p>Rodger is convinced that a “clean, blunt bob” is the answer to feeling polished without the effort, like this cut on STIL client <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DJcGcLqIu_E/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Abbie de Fontaine</a>. “The strong, even line gives you instant structure,” he says. “Plus, it looks incredible peeking out from under winter and spring layers.” He adds that the cut is particularly beautiful on slightly wavy or straight, finer hair, as it lends weight and sharpness. For the best result, Rodger suggests asking for a chin-to-collarbone bob with crisp, blunt ends and minimal layering. “Keep it sleek or lightly textured depending on your hair type,” he says.</p>

<p>Sometimes when we least expect <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-are-5-love-languages-meaning"">it, love appears</a>. Venus in Capricorn is going to bring a lot of rizz to our hearts, allowing us to elevate our romantic game. The last week of December 2025 and first week of January 2026 are going to be filled with tenderness in its purest and deepest form; the planets aren’t fooling around when it comes to committing. Rather than playing games, we’ll be inclined to be direct and honest with what we require in partnerships. So, ramp up your profile on the dating apps, clear the cache, and get hyper-specific about what you’re looking for, because things are about to get interesting in the midst <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cuffing-season-relationship-experiences"">of cuffing season</a>.</p>



<p>Typically, the transit of Venus and Capricorn allows us to take a mature approach to romantic relationships. We state our intentions in the beginning to ensure that we’re on the same page with others. There are no hidden agendas or shadiness when it comes to what we’re giving and pulling in, meaning that our agenda is clear: we want to be a part of a union and take steps towards advancing it in the simplest ways without any drama. Building a life together, with our crush/boo, with structure and shared goals, is essential. We are willing to combine resources to create a strong foundation that can’t be broken.</p>



<p>When it <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/making-friends-connections-adulthood"">comes to friendships</a>, we will not settle for the company of those who treat us unjustly and unkindly. Having people around us who respect and honor our time, as well as our qualities, is important. After all, we don’t want to give our energy to those who aren’t going to reciprocate fairly, which is another core theme of Venus in Capricorn. The earthiness of this aspect makes us feel super connected to our besties. Keep in mind that the focus is on material things, so we may desire shopping sprees, wine tastings, spa days, or decadent meals with our crew instead of hanging out at the local pub or coffee house.</p>



<p>From December 24, 2025, to January 17, 2026, Venus in Capricorn is making us believe in our visions of devotion. The presence of Neptune in Pisces adds a softer vibe, allowing us to fall head over heels. Luckily, Saturn gives us the strength not to go overboard. The caveat is that boundaries will be instrumental in how we move forward with others. If you get the opportunity to peek through your significant other’s iCal, resist the urge. If you opt to be nosy and get caught, it might cause major rifts. </p>



<p>On the other end of the spectrum, the first of two Venus Star Points occurs on January 6, 2026 (the last one is cosmically slated for October 23, 2026. The term is coined by astrologer Arielle Guttman, who considers the meeting of the Sun and Venus in the same sign and degree (also known as “cazimi”) to bring about metamorphic changes. Venus becomes an evening star, making it hard to spot in the sky, but not in our spirit. Since this celestial union is in Capricorn, we are inclined to make pragmatic decisions about whom we commit. Get ready to adjust your relationship status on social media! </p>



<p>As a result, Venus in Capricorn pushes us to put the effort into our passions to ensure they become tangible and true. Roll up your sleeves and start working to get what you deserve when it comes to cultivating relationships. It’ll be worth the time and energy in the end. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951226.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Welcome to a major transition week, R29 babes. On December 21st, the solstice strikes and Capricorn Season officially begins, marking one of the most powerful energetic pivots of the year. In astrology, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">solstices are threshold moments</a>: they represent extremes of light and dark, visibility and invisibility, action and rest. This one ushers us into four weeks of self-dedication, sovereignty, and intentional effort. And because <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars is already in Capricorn</a> as the sun changes signs, we haven’t entered this energy cold.</p>



<p>We’ve been acclimating to discipline, devotion, and long-term thinking for weeks now. What shifts at the solstice is not effort, but <em>orientation</em>: we move from Sagittarius’s freedom-seeking, exploratory energy into Capricorn’s grounded commitment to self, legacy, and responsibility. We’re also coming off the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-new-moon-in-sagittarius-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Sagittarius New Moon</a>, making this an ideal week to set intentions if you haven’t yet, or to recommit to the ones that truly matter.</p>



<p>Before the sun even enters Capricorn, though, there’s an important emotional undercurrent. In the early hours of December 21st at 5:08 a.m. EST, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, creating a moment of tension between sensitivity and action. Jupiter in Cancer amplifies emotional truth, memory, and the need for safety, while Chiron in Aries exposes wounds around identity, courage, and self-assertion.</p>



<p>Collectively, this can feel like wanting to protect ourselves while also being asked totake bold steps forward. Old insecurities may flare up, especially around whether we’re  allowed to take up space or move decisively while still honoring our feelings. The entry into Capricorn Season acts as a grounding balm after this square, reminding us that we don’t have to choose between emotional honesty and forward momentum. We can build from both.</p>



<p>As the week unfolds, the Capricorn influence deepens. On December 24th, Venus enters Capricorn, joining the sun and Mars and bringing seriousness to our relationships — romantic, platonic, and professional. Even during the holidays, the collective mood is less about small talk and more about substance. We’re thinking about money, security, generational wealth, and what (or who) is actually worth investing in. Standards are higher, patience is thinner, and performative connection won’t cut it. This is a powerful moment to turn that discernment inward first. How can you live according to the standards you expect from others? How can you embody the stability, integrity, and commitment you’re craving? Capricorn Season isn’t about deprivation — it’s about self-respect. And this solstice week sets the tone.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> begins with a potent internal–external tension. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your career, reputation, and long-term goals light up, asking you to take yourself seriously and step more fully into leadership. But just before that shift, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in your sign, bringing emotional material to the surface, especially around home, family, and your inner child. You may feel pulled between ambition and vulnerability, between showing up powerfully in the world and tending to old wounds that want your attention. This can be an uncomfortable but clarifying start to the week. The message is clear: true authority comes from emotional honesty. When you acknowledge where you still need care, you actually become more grounded and effective in your public life.</p>



<p>As the week continues, the focus sharpens. On December 24th, Venus enters Capricorn, joining the sun and Mars and intensifying themes around professional relationships, long-term commitments, and the value you bring to the table. The second half of the week asks you to evaluate where your time, energy, and talents are going, and whether they’re being reciprocated in meaningful ways. This isn’t about chasing validation; it’s about alignment. You may feel less patient with superficial interactions and more drawn to connections that support your growth and legacy. Capricorn energy here reminds you that success isn’t just about achievement… it’s about building something you can stand behind with pride.</p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, the solstice ushers in Capricorn season and activates your sector of higher learning, belief systems, and long-term vision, inviting you to zoom out and consider where you’re headed next. But this week doesn’t begin in purely practical territory. Just before the sun enters Capricorn, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, stirring emotional material in your subconscious and healing sector. Old fears, unspoken worries, or patterns you’ve kept buried may surface, especially around trusting yourself to move forward without having everything figured out. This square can feel disorienting, but it’s also liberating. You’re being asked to release limiting beliefs that have quietly shaped your decisions and to make room for a more compassionate inner narrative as you step into the next chapter.</p>



<p>As the week unfolds, Venus, your ruling planet, enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and bringing clarity to what you want to commit to long-term. The second half of the week favors intentional planning, meaningful conversations about the future, and decisions that support growth beyond your comfort zone. You may feel drawn to travel plans, educational pursuits, or spiritual practices that offer both structure and inspiration. Rather than rushing, Capricorn energy encourages you to build your expansion thoughtfully. This is about choosing paths that feel both grounding and expansive — ones that honor your values while helping you grow beyond what’s familiar.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, cosmic beings, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> begins with emotional depth and psychological insight. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your focus shifts to intimacy, shared resources, trust, and energetic exchange. But before that grounding takes hold, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, activating tensions between your friendships, future goals, and deeper emotional wounds around belonging. You may notice sensitivities around who truly supports you, who drains you, and where you’ve overextended yourself socially or emotionally. This square can surface discomfort, but it’s also clarifying. It asks you to get honest about reciprocity, and to release group dynamics or obligations that no longer feel aligned as you prepare for a more intentional chapter.</p>



<p>As the week unfolds, Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and deepening your desire for emotional and financial integrity. The second half of the week favors serious conversations around shared money, long-term commitments, or emotional boundaries. You may feel less inclined toward surface-level connection and more focused on building trust that’s earned, not assumed. Capricorn energy here supports mature intimacy — the kind that feels stabilizing rather than consuming. This solstice week reminds you that when your inner world is supported, your outer brilliance flows more freely.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> places relationships at the center of your attention. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your partnership sector is activated, bringing focus to commitment, collaboration, and emotional balance with others. Just before that shift, Jupiter in your sign squares Chiron in Aries, highlighting tension between your personal growth and professional or public-facing wounds. You may feel torn between honoring your emotional needs and showing up confidently in the world. Old insecurities around visibility or leadership could resurface, but they do so in order to be healed. This square asks you to trust that caring for yourself doesn’t weaken your ambition… it strengthens it.</p>



<p>As the week continues, Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and adding seriousness to your relationships. The second half of the week encourages you to assess which connections feel mutual, stable, and aligned with your long-term goals. You may feel less interested in keeping the peace at all costs and more committed to partnerships that offer real support. This is a powerful moment to redefine what commitment means to you: choosing relationships that feel grounding, respectful, and capable of growing with you.</p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> begins with a call to recalibrate your energy and priorities. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your focus shifts to work, health, routines, and the systems that hold your daily life together. But before that grounding fully settles in, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, activating emotional material tied to rest, burnout, faith, and old beliefs about always having to be “on.” You may feel the tension between wanting to push forward and realizing your body or spirit needs more care. This is a powerful moment to listen to subtle signals — fatigue, irritation, or restlessness are all messages asking you to work <em>with</em> yourself, not against yourself.</p>



<p>As the week progresses, Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and bringing harmony and intentionality to your daily life. The second half of the week is ideal for refining habits, improving work dynamics, and committing to routines that support your long-term vitality. This isn’t about restriction… it’s about self-respect. You may feel more motivated to clean up your schedule, set clearer boundaries at work, or invest in practices that make you feel stronger and more capable. This solstice week reminds you that sustainable success starts with taking care of the engine that powers it all: you.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> activates themes of joy, creativity, and emotional honesty. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your sector of pleasure, romance, and self-expression comes into focus, inviting you to take what you love seriously. But just before that grounding energy settles in, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, surfacing deeper feelings around vulnerability, trust, and shared emotional or financial investments. You may notice where you’ve been over-giving, overthinking, or holding back out of fear of losing control. This square can stir discomfort, but it also offers healing clarity, especially around intimacy and what you truly need to feel safe opening your heart.</p>



<p>As the week continues, Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and bringing warmth, devotion, and maturity to matters of love and creativity. The second half of the week favors meaningful connection over casual interaction. Whether romantic or artistic, you’re drawn toward experiences that feel grounded, intentional, and worth investing in. This is a powerful time to commit to a passion project, deepen a relationship, or simply allow yourself to enjoy what you’ve worked so hard to build. The solstice reminds you that joy doesn’t have to be earned… it can be chosen.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> is giving “I said I was fine, but the body kept the receipts.” As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your focus turns inward to home, family, and emotional foundations. You’re craving comfort, stability, and maybe even a little nesting energy. But just before that grounding arrives, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, poking at the tension between your public image and your closest relationships. Translation: you might be killing it at work or showing up polished on the outside, while privately feeling misunderstood, under-supported, or low-key exhausted by certain dynamics. This could look like smiling through a family dinner you’d rather skip, or realizing you’ve been people-pleasing your way into burnout. The solstice asks you to be honest about where you actually need support instead of pretending you’ve got it all handled.</p>



<p>By midweek, the vibe shifts from emotional awareness to practical action. On December 24th, Venus, your ruling planet, enters Capricorn, joining the sun and Mars and turning your attention to what stability really looks like. The second half of the week is perfect for setting boundaries at home, having the “okay but how are we <em>actually</em> doing?” conversation, or making decisions that support your long-term peace, even if they’re not immediately popular. This is Capricorn energy with receipts: choosing rest over obligation, quality over quantity, and emotional safety over aesthetics. The glow-up here is subtle but powerful. You’re learning that balance isn’t about keeping everyone happy… it’s about creating a life that doesn’t drain you.</p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> is delivering truths with zero fluff and no emotional cushioning. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your mind shifts into strategist mode. Communication, scheduling, boundaries, and logistics suddenly matter a lot more. But before you can fully enjoy the clarity, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, stirring tension between your big-picture beliefs and the daily grind that’s been quietly wearing you down. You may realize you’ve been philosophizing your way around a very real problem, like saying “it’ll work out” instead of actually fixing your schedule, your habits, or your burnout. The solstice doesn’t judge you for this. It just hands you the clipboard and asks you to be honest.</p>



<p>Then, because the universe loves divine timing, Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and upgrading your communication style from “intuitive and intense” to “clear, intentional, and impossible to misinterpret.” The second half of the week favors direct conversations, firm decisions, and cutting through emotional static. You’re less interested in explaining yourself and more interested in results. Think fewer dramatic monologues, more bullet points. This is a powerful moment to say what you mean, mean what you say, and stop entertaining dynamics that require you to over-function. Capricorn energy doesn’t ask you to be nicer — it asks you to be effective.</p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> is giving “freedom, but make it fiscally responsible.” As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your focus shifts to money, self-worth, and what you actually have to show for all those big ideas. But before you can fully lean into the budgeting era, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, stirring emotional stuff around shared resources, trust, and independence. You may notice a low-grade irritation about having to rely on someone else, or realizing you’ve been way too chill about an arrangement that deserves more structure. The solstice doesn’t cancel your optimism; it just asks you to back it up with a plan.</p>



<p>By the second half of the week, the tone sharpens. Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and making it clear that your time, energy, and talents are not a charity. You’re more selective about how you spend your money and who gets access to you. This could look like saying no to last-minute plans, renegotiating financial terms, or finally admitting that “exposure” is not a currency. Capricorn energy here isn’t about being boring, it’s about valuing yourself enough to build something sustainable. The real freedom comes from knowing you’re not winging it anymore.</p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the solstice marks your official reset, and you feel it immediately. As the sun enters your sign on December 21st, the focus shifts back to <em>you</em>: your body, your boundaries, your identity, your direction. But before that clarity fully lands, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, bringing up emotional tension between your public role and your private foundation. You may feel pulled between responsibility and vulnerability, between being “the strong one” and needing support yourself. Old family patterns or inner-child wounds could surface, not to derail you, but to remind you that leadership doesn’t mean emotional self-denial. This solstice asks you to define success in a way that includes your well-being, not just your output.</p>



<p>As the week continues, your presence sharpens. On December 24th, Venus enters your sign, joining the sun and Mars and adding magnetism, maturity, and seriousness to how you show up and what you attract. People notice you more now, but not because you’re performing. It’s because you’re embodied. The second half of the week is ideal for recommitting to yourself, refining your goals, and setting the tone for the year ahead. You may feel less interested in explaining yourself and more interested in alignment. The shadow here is over-identifying with productivity or carrying responsibility that isn’t yours. The power move? Choosing yourself without guilt. Capricorn Season doesn’t ask you to do more… it asks you to do what matters.</p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> is giving “main character energy, but with emotional accountability.” As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, you slip into a quieter, more behind-the-scenes mode. This activates your rest, reflection, and subconscious sector, which already feels ironic given how visible your thoughts usually are. But before you can fully retreat, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, highlighting tension between your daily responsibilities and how you communicate your needs. You might realize you’ve been intellectually explaining your feelings instead of actually <em>feeling</em> them. Or pushing through exhaustion because “it’s fine.” The solstice gently (but firmly) calls that bluff.</p>



<p>Then, because the universe loves a slow burn, Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and reinforcing the message: rest is not optional, and boundaries are not rude. The second half of the week favors solitude with purpose: tying up loose ends, clearing emotional clutter, and quietly deciding what you’re no longer available for in 2026. This isn’t isolation; it’s preparation. Capricorn energy here asks you to stop leaking energy in places that don’t return it. You’re not disappearing…you’re conserving power. And honestly? That’s very on brand for the upgrade ahead.</p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> is quietly calling you out, in a loving, no-nonsense way. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your focus shifts to friends, community, and long-term goals. But before that clarity fully lands, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, activating tension between joy, creativity, romance, and your relationship with money or self-worth. Translation: you might want to do what feels good, but there’s a voice reminding you that vibes alone don’t pay bills or sustain dreams. You could feel emotionally exposed around what you deserve versus what you’ve been settling for. The solstice doesn’t shame you for dreaming… it simply asks whether you’re willing to support those dreams with structure.</p>



<p>Then the tone firms up. Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and bringing seriousness to your social life. The second half of the week is about discernment: who’s actually aligned with your future, and who’s just along for the ride? You may feel less available for emotional freeloading and more interested in connections that show up consistently. Capricorn energy here helps you mature your compassion, keeping your heart open without overextending yourself. You’re learning that boundaries don’t make you colder; they make your magic sustainable. And honestly? That’s the ultimate end-of-year glow up.</p>

<p><strong>Spoilers ahead. </strong>Is it actually possible to recover from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/inner-child-healing"">childhood trauma</a>, or will the effects linger forever? That’s the question <em>Ella McCay </em>asks, the new film from three-time Academy Award winner James L. Brooks (<em>Terms of Endearment</em>, <em>As Good as It Gets</em>). Following Ella McCay, played by Emma Mackey (<em>Barbie</em>, <em>Sex Education</em>), the 34-year-old lieutenant governor juggles the grief of her mother’s death as well as a strained relationship with her father, with help from her caring Aunt Helen, played by <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/freakier-friday-movie-fashion-costumes"">Jamie Lee Curtis (</a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/freakier-friday-movie-fashion-costumes"">Freaky Friday</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/freakier-friday-movie-fashion-costumes"">, <em>Everything Everywhere All At Once</em>)</a>. </p>



<p>Ella exhibits signs of people-pleasing behaviour in both her work and personal life after watching her father repeatedly cheat on her mother. She seems doomed to repeat the cycle, trying her best to have a “normal” marriage with her husband Ryan (Jack Lowden), which results in her overcompensating to make him happy. Principal psychologist <a href=""https://enrichinglivespsychology.com.au/about"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Carly Dober from Enriching Lives Psychology</a> tells <em>Refinery29</em> this could be due to a need to “establish a false sense of safety” and notes it’s a common trauma response. “People-pleasing can also be linked to emotional dependency. [This] occurs when someone has unmet psychological needs that they may try to satisfy within close interpersonal relationships,” Dober says. “[It] is a pattern of behaviours people may engage in to get others to like them, and to avoid rejection, criticism, or embarrassment. It’s linked to traits such as depression, anxiety and low self-esteem.”</p>



<p>Mackey confirms that <em>Ella McCay </em>is a study of the “human condition”, and tells us that’s partly what drew her to the role. “The film is very much about cycles and cycles being broken, or not in a few cases, and about what you decide to make of yourself,” Mackey tells <em>R29</em>. Throughout the film, her Aunt Helen acts like a driving force in her life, and calls out the behaviour of Ella’s husband. Mackey notes it can be “unsettling” to have somebody by your side pointing out flaws or truths you want to avoid, but in some ways, there’s a “comfort” to it as well. “She’s the truth sayer, and says the uncomfortable thing when I don’t want to hear it, and it’s absolutely spot on every time,” Mackey says. “And we all need one of those people in our lives just to bring us back to what’s real and to make us think about it… and then we’ve got to work with it, work through it.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>We all need one of those people in our lives just to bring us back to what’s real and make us think about it… then we’ve got to work with it, work through it.</p><cite>Emma MackeY</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>There’s one particular line in the family that gives audiences a closer look into Ella’s psyche, and that’s when she admits she adores her husband because he comes from a “normal family”. She deems it “normal” because his parents are still married, unlike Ella’s own experience. It’s telling that she prioritizes this above other traits he possesses, such as his manipulative tendencies. By making choices rooted in trauma, she’s ended up in the midst of another unhappy cycle. Curtis says these family dynamics and trauma portrayed in <em>Ella McCay</em> are what make this film feel so rooted in reality. “That’s what makes movies so relatable, and particularly family movies, is that you can sit there and watch a movie as a family and realise your family is different from the family you’re watching on screen, but there are a lot of similarities,” Curtis explains. “Hopefully, families have an Aunt Helen, that person in your life who champions you even though you’re getting battered.” </p>



<p>As difficult as it is to see Ella’s life crumble around her during the film, Mackey says it’s important to stumble at times so you can succeed in the future. “Unless you [stumble], you have no perspective, and you don’t know what’s important,” Mackey says. “You don’t want to seek or search what you’re curious about if you don’t stumble a couple of, or a lot of times.”</p>



<p>And while the drama-comedy tugs at the heartstrings, Curtis says she wants audiences to take away one thing. “There is no opposite word for trauma, but hope comes close,” she says, quoting the film. “That, to me, is where you understand that even with traumatic experiences, hope for the future, hope for your family, hope for the world, hope for potential. All of it comes pretty close to being a counterpoint to the bad things that have happened.”</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11869365.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/led-face-mask-red-light-skin-benefits"">LED face masks</a> are everywhere these days, but many seem more alike than not. It’s as if we have a <em>Devil Wears Prada</em> blue belt situation on our hands. So, when Shark Beauty unveiled its first foray in the skin tech space, I was intrigued — not only because I’m a fan of the brand, but because this wasn’t just <em>any</em> LED mask. </p>



<p>As the name suggests, the <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/cryoglow-tm-cooling-led-face-mask-P515543"">CryoGlow™ Cooling &amp; LED Face Mask</a> offers red and blue light therapy to help brighten, firm, and clear skin. However, it’s also equipped with cooling pads to depuff and wake up tired eyes. If that sounds like some seriously souped-up beauty tech, it’s because it is. Could this be the game-changer my routine needs? I set out to find out.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/P515543"">Shark CryoGlow Under-Eye Cooling+LED Face Mask</a>, $349.99</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11869244.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=756&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=256%3A189"" /></figure>



<h2><strong>What is Shark’s CryoGlow mask, and how do you use it?</strong></h2>



<p>Per the brand, the <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/P515543"">CryoGlow face mask</a> was developed with dermatologists and clinical trials to back its claims of reducing the appearance of fine lines and reducing breakouts within weeks. It features something called iQLED Technology™ (aka, derm-developed treatment cycles of red, blue, and deep infrared light) distributed evenly throughout the inside of the mask. But as I hinted at earlier, perhaps the biggest point of differentiation is the Cryo-inspired cooling mechanism, which claims to visibly depuff the under-eye area post-use.</p>



<h2><strong>What makes Shark’s CryoGlow mask special?</strong></h2>



<p>My CryoGlow mask is a pretty shade of powder blue (it also comes in a muted lilac), with a matching satin pouch for storage. I love that it powers up via a remote control instead of an app. (Call me old school, but I miss the days when we didn’t have an app for <em>everything</em>.) You can cycle through four different treatments for various concerns  — acne, fine lines, a four-min express treatment, and one focused on tightening and brightening the under-eye area — which combine infrared light and red and blue LEDs (plus those cooling pads, which feel like heaven for tired, puffy eyes), so you can tailor your session based on what your skin is craving that day. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951829.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Is Shark’s CryoGlow mask worth it?</strong></h2>



<p>At $350, it’s among the more affordable LED masks I’ve seen —  it’s still expensive but solidly less so than other popular ones on the market. (For comparison, <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/spectralite-faceware-pro-P435378?skuId=2109718&amp;icid2="">Dr. Dennis Gross’ version</a> retails for $455, <a href=""https://us.currentbody.com/products/currentbody-skin-led-light-therapy-mask?variant=41833057157217"">CurrentBody’s Series 2</a> is $470, and <a href=""https://www.revolve.com/therabody-theraface-mask/dp/TRAG-WU16/"">Therabody</a>’s is $650. Hollywood aesthetician <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/shani-darden-by-deesse-pro-led-light-mask-P502216"">Shani Darden</a> launched an LED mask that retails for a whopping $1900.) The full-face mask feels durable but is shockingly lightweight, making it among the most comfortable ones I’ve tried, too. </p>



<p>I first started testing this mask out as part of my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/doing-own-wedding-bridal-makeup-advice"">wedding skin prep</a>, and now that I’m six months post-wedding (and almost an entire year into testing this out), I have to say: It’s still one of the most effective steps in my entire beauty routine. My biggest skin goals right now are keeping acne flareups at bay, enhancing my overall glow, and reducing inflammation. In the past, I’ve struggled with consistency in using LED masks, so they didn’t do a whole lot for me. My consensus now is that they can be a great addition to your skincare routine — but only if you commit. (It’s like sunscreen, in that sense: The best one is the one you’ll use everyday.) </p>



<p>Another unexpected benefit of LED masks that I don’t think gets talked about enough has nothing to do with skin. After weeks of carving out time at the end of my day for some LED therapy, I realized that it had become something I genuinely looked forward to, just to get a few minutes of not doing anything else. Sure, sometimes I’d scroll through Instagram while sitting through an eight-minute treatment, but most days, I’d just lay on my couch cuddling my dog (he doesn’t mind one bit that I’m giving <em>Iron Man</em>), or even close my eyes for a little meditative moment. The fact that I have healthier, happier skin to show for it? Simply a (really good) bonus.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951797.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Rejoice! The last days of 2025 bring the onset of Capricorn season. On December 21st, the sun officially enters Capricorn and it’ll be a potent moment of contemplation, meditation, deliberation, and aspiration. The reason is that we are entering the coldest time of the year, as the Winter Solstice marks the beginning of a new season on the same day the sun enters Capricorn. The start of Yule connects us with friends and families to celebrate the past year and look forward to the future. At this juncture, we can start <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/manifest-goals-2025-zodiac-signs"">manifesting our dreams</a> by expressing our heartfelt intentions, which catapult us into the place and space we wish to be. </p>



<p>Since Capricorn energy is associated with working hard to make our desires come to fruition, we often put our best foot forward to seize the day at the office. Usually, we become rigid in our efforts to become the next CEO, get the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/salary-story-flight-risk-job-promotion"">promotion we deserve</a>, or elevate our status. Capricorn energy climbs the corporate ladder with ease, skipping steps or resorting to manipulative tactics to win. Success is due to our tenacity in evolving and our desire for accolades. The goal of the month is to take charge and be a boss. Working hard is a must, but so too is playing hard. </p>



<p>With Capricorn season coinciding with a new year, we have hope and the incentive to start anew, recognizing that we can refine structure to improve situations and relationships. As a result of this thinking, we begin to discuss the concept of time and how much we can accomplish in the weeks ahead to leave a lasting legacy over the twelve months. It’s not that the vibe makes us competitive per se, it’s that we want to prove our power to the world to gain accolades and respect from those we care about. Building an empire and committing to projects that speak to our spirit define our lives — so grab your inner sea goat by the horns! </p>



<p>Capricorn is one of the most sensitive signs of the zodiac. They are the watery part of the Earth because they reside in both the ocean and on land. The sea goat has a very tender heart and will go to bat for anyone in their inner circle. They have an austere reputation due to their no-nonsense and mature attitude. Capricorn energy can be highly intuitive because it helps us align more closely with our gut feelings. In the weeks ahead, we will be able to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-intuition-gut-instinct-personal-safety"">trust our opinions and instincts</a>, knowing that we are choosing the right path for ourselves, even when we are torn between options. After a moment of reflection, we will be able to find guidance within.</p>



<p>This year, Capricorn season brings us face-to-face with our last chance to learn from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/saturn-retrograde-in-aries-and-pisces-horoscope-july-2025-meaning-effects"">Saturn in Pisces</a>. The karmic planet is going to be changing signs during Aquarius season, which is coming up, so we need to wrap up the story that we’ve been perpetuating over the past three years. Being that Saturn is the planetary ruler of Capricorn, it’s for us to see how we’ve grown since March 2023. When Saturn leaves Pisces for the next 27 years on February 13th, 2026, it will bring a major vibe shift. Consider how we can cultivate our spirituality, establish firmer boundaries with others, and commit to what we genuinely love. </p>



<p>The overall energy is quieter than in previous years, allowing us to heal and relax. Finding peace and solace in our hearts and lives will allow us to find serenity. It would be great to have a calm entrance into the new year, so we can take the proper steps to propel our passions forward. </p>

<p>Of all the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charlotte-tilbury-makeup-skincare-review"">makeup brands</a> — and there are far too many to count — only one consistently dominates beauty editor conversations. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/merit-beauty-tinted-mineral-sunscreen-spf-50-review"">Enter: Merit.</a></p>



<p>If one of us has impossibly <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tatcha-dewy-milk-moisturizer-review"">dewy skin</a>, plumper lips, or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-lash-curl-finisher-review"">longer lashes</a> than usual, the question is always the same: Is it Merit? I even know one editor who insisted her makeup artist use entirely Merit products on her <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/doing-own-wedding-bridal-makeup-advice"">wedding day</a>, and for good reason. It’s one of the few brands that makes makeup look like it’s simply part of you — like you’re wearing it, not the other way around. </p>



<p>Think of the brand as a step above <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/summer-makeup-trends-2025"">no-makeup makeup</a>. It keeps things natural with sheer textures and effortless sticks, yet everything can be layered for a bolder, more striking look. But with both editors and TikTok beauty enthusiasts singing its praises, which Merit products are actually worth your money? </p>



<p>I put $380 of Merit makeup and skincare to the test, and here’s my honest verdict.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-uniform-spf-45"">Merit The Uniform Tinted Mineral Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 45</a></h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951651.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>In May, I called this the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/merit-beauty-tinted-mineral-sunscreen-spf-50-review"">best tinted sunscreen</a> I’d ever tried, and months later, I still stand by that. In fact, I’ve been using it ever since I discovered it. Unlike others, which can feel thick or chalky, this goes on and absorbs like a lightweight moisturizer, with medium coverage that’s enough to conceal my breakouts and dark circles. The finish sits somewhere between matte and dewy. Most tinted sunscreens fade after a few hours, but not this one. Its staying power is impressive for something so featherlight, and it always feels comfortable. That said, I don’t rely on it for sunscreen alone — I always layer it over a dedicated SPF.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-minimalist"">Merit The Minimalist Perfecting Complexion Stick</a></h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951789.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>I’ll be honest: I didn’t think I’d enjoy using this, but it’s quickly become my go-to concealer. As someone with acne-prone skin, I’ve always been told to avoid creamy stick products because they often contain pore-clogging waxes. While this does have some waxes on the ingredient list, it remarkably doesn’t break me out. I usually use it to spot-conceal, tapping it in with my fingers, and I’m always impressed by the coverage and how well it tucks away redness. When I’m feeling too lazy for “proper” makeup, I scribble it all over my face and blend with a dense, fluffy brush. The result feels like a light tint with the pigment of a foundation, but it always looks like my skin, and never like a mask.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fflush-balm"">Merit Flush Balm Cheek Color</a></h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951684.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>I’ll admit I wasn’t a big fan of Flush Balm the first time I tried it — but that was because I had the completely wrong shade. My advice: go slightly darker than you think. Since the product is pretty sheer, it needs to be built up if you want a bolder blush look. Here, I’m wearing Le Bon Bon, a stunning fuchsia pink, and I’m starting to think I’ll never go back to the other blushes in my makeup bag. It gives my cheeks the most natural, just-come-in-from-the-cold flush. My partner even noticed and complimented my makeup. Thanks to the creamy texture, it doesn’t last quite as long as I’d like, but a quick layer of translucent powder fixes that. If you don’t want to swipe it directly onto your foundation (I hate transfer!), tap a dense brush over the dome of the product and apply it that way.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fbronze-balm%3F_pos%3D1%26_psq%3Dbronz%26_ss%3De%26_v%3D1.0"">Merit Bronze Balm Sheer Bronzer</a></h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951674.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>I was pleasantly surprised by how effortlessly this glided onto my skin and how quickly it blended — the texture is that silky. Sometimes foundation can flatten my features, but this product brings depth back in. I use it in the hollows of my cheeks to define my bone structure, down the center of my nose, and across my temples for a sun-kissed glow, and even on my eyelids as a natural-looking eyeshadow. It layers beautifully under Flush Balm, though if you want it to last all day, a setting powder is a must.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fday-glow"">Merit Day Glow Highlighting Balm</a></h2>

<p>I usually skip highlighter, but the marbled look of this domed stick was so mesmerizing, I had to try it — and I’m glad I did. It literally looks and feels like dewy skincare, thanks to moisturizing squalane and skin-healing vitamins and amino acids. It contains ultra-fine pearl pigments but never looks dusty or glittery. Instead, it gives a gorgeous, natural gloss that only improves as your skin’s oils blend with it throughout the day. Here, I applied some in the inner corners of my eyes, and I’m convinced it makes me appear more awake. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsolo-shadow"">Merit Solo Shadow</a></h2>

<p>Ok, this is my new favorite eyeshadow. I can never be bothered with two or three shades, and smoky eyes are absolutely not my skill set, but a single wash of color can take my makeup from meh to next level, tying together blush, bronzer, and lips in perfect harmony. Here, I’m wearing Studio, which the brand calls a “cool taupe.” It leans slightly bronze without any orange, so it looks like it belongs on my eyes. The best part, though, is how effortlessly it applies. You could use your finger, but I go with a fluffy brush — the blend is seamless, and it takes just 10 seconds to create this look. Even better? It lasts much longer than other cream eyeshadows I’ve tried, and because it dries down to a soft powder, it barely creases.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrow-1990"">Merit Brow 1990 Sheer Gel Pencil</a></h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951689.jpg?width=730&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=365%3A512"" /></figure>



<p>I wasn’t sure how I’d get this pencil through my thick brows — it’s that fine — but it’s exactly what I needed. Using it actually made me realize how bad the pencil I was using before really was. Because it’s so precise, you can fill in the gaps, mimicking the finest, softest brow hairs without anything looking blocky. The spoolie on the end lets you feather it out if you go a little heavy. Just don’t press too hard, or you’ll snap the nib in half and lose it down the sink.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrow-1980%3F_pos%3D1%26_psq%3Dbrow%26_ss%3De%26_v%3D1.0%26variant%3D43975772405946"">Merit Brow 1980 Volumizing Pomade</a></h2>

<p>Brow pomades are usually too wet and messy, but this one is just right. My brows are naturally quite dark, but this adds the perfect finishing touch after the pencil, locking my thick hairs in place without making them feel stiff or greasy like others. On lazy days, I’ll just run the brush through, and it instantly gives my brows more volume. I also love that the tapered brush lets you define the inner and outer corners without any smudging.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-liner%3F_pos%3D2%26_psq%3Dlip%26_ss%3De%26_v%3D1.0"">Merit Signature Lip Liner</a></h2>

<p>Because this lip liner is so sheer, it doesn’t stick around for very long. That said, it’s so moisturizing that reapplying is easy. Sometimes I don’t even bother looking in the mirror; I just scribble it on and smudge it out with my fingers. My lips are chronically dry, and most liners only make that worse, but this one glides on beautifully, thanks to the jojoba oil. Most days, I use this as my lipstick, enlisting a fluffy brush to blend it out and blur the edges. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip"">Merit Signature Lip Lightweight Lipstick</a></h2>

<p>To me, this feels more like a tinted lip balm than a true lipstick — the name says it all, I guess! It glides on easily, giving a satin-like veil of color that feels moisturizing, thanks to squalane and sunflower seed oil. It only lasts a couple of hours on me, but because it’s so soft and lightweight, I just swipe it on like a balm. Here I’m wearing Slip, though I tend to prefer the pinker shades on my olive skin. I also wish the packaging felt a bit more luxe. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fclean-lash"">Merit Clean Lash Lengthening Mascara</a></h2>

<p>This mascara takes a bit of work — three to four coats in my experience — but the result is the most naturally fluttery lashes. It has an old-school bristle brush that requires slow, deliberate combing to build up layers, rather than a silicone brush that deposits product instantly. That actually worked in my favor, because it didn’t leave any clumps. Instead, my lashes looked long and fluffy, almost like falsies. The best part is that it’s a tubing mascara that comes off with just warm water. Tubing formulas are also less likely to smudge or flake, and this one never does. I’m already on my third tube.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fshade-slick"">Merit Shade Slick Tinted Lip Oil</a></h2>

<p>Most lip oils I’ve tried feel like a lip gloss in disguise, but this one is different. It isn’t sticky at all, so you don’t have to worry about it trapping hair when you step outside. Quinoa seed oil is the star ingredient, acting like skincare for your lips by deeply moisturizing and supporting the skin barrier — the outer layer that keeps moisture in and bacteria out. The tint is subtle but lovely, and I like layering it over lipstick for a soft, glossy boost. Because it’s an oil rather than a gloss, it sinks in fairly quickly, so to pop in your purse for touch-ups.</p>

<p>This is such a quenching moisturizer, and even though it’s designed to prime skin for makeup, I often wear it on its own for a glow boost. Moisturizing glycerin and hydrating hyaluronic acid are the stars, while skin-strengthening peptides support healing, and collagen and elastin help keep skin supple. It doesn’t contain any reflective pigments, but you wouldn’t guess that, considering the natural dew it gives dry skin. Even better, it’s non-comedogenic, so it’s much less likely to clog pores or cause breakouts. When I use this, my makeup lasts noticeably longer than it does over other moisturizers. </p>

When I told one of my best friends I was finally about to get a Korean digital perm, she was horrified and said I would probably regret it. Look, I get it. The perm is controversial. You probably instantly think of giant fluffy ’80s hairdos or tight ringlets. But unlike traditional perms, the Korean style uses heat technology to create softer curls, which appear more natural. </p>



<p>My hair is naturally straight with a slight wave that becomes more obvious the shorter it is. I also have incredibly thick and heavy lengths, so when I use a curling iron, I have to douse my hair in hairspray to ensure the curls don’t fall out. As somebody who’s always wanted curly hair, getting a Korean digital perm was an easy decision. Both my older brother and sister have perms, so I was confident going in. I went to my hairstylist Chloe Choi at <a href=""https://www.chloehair.com.au/"">Chloe Hair &amp; Beauty</a>, but Korean perms are becoming more popular in salons worldwide. Together, we discussed what could be done while looking at some photos I’d brought along for inspiration. She confirmed that my hair type is frizzy with a slight natural wave, and we settled on a direct digital perm to create some tighter curls. </p>

<p>There are a handful of benefits to a Korean perm: “Normal perms mean sometimes you can’t see definition in the curls, but with digital perms you can,” said Choi, who used to work at a salon in Myeong-dong, South Korea, before moving to Sydney. Before we started with my perm, Choi recommended starting with a Japanese Tokio Treatment, which helps repair hair from the inside out. By replenishing it with keratin, it strengthens, moisturizes, and smooths each hair strand. “A lot of people really like this brand,” Choi explained. “It’s a repairing treatment, and it adds moisture to your hair. Some people will come back after their perms get dry and then have another Tokio Treatment,” she told me.</p>



<h2>What is a Korean digital perm?</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11947860.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>

<p>Choi started by washing my hair and applying the Tokio Treatment, before setting up an additional hot steam treatment to help hydrate each strand of hair. The steam “opens” up the hair cuticle, allowing moisture and products to absorb. After getting a small trim where Choi enhanced my layers, my hair was rewashed with a pH-balancing shampoo. She then followed this with a Korean product that protects the hair from the typically harsh perming chemicals used to break and reset the protein bonds in the hair. It’s this which results in a curl or wave. </p>



<p>Next, Choi placed the digital perm lotion directly onto my hair and rolled sections tightly into curlers to take shape, then plugged each curler in, allowing them to be set by heat. Choi told me that my hair was “strong”, so we had to wait over 20 minutes before it started to set. Then we headed back to the basin where my hair was washed with a neutralizer, snapping the protein bonds back into place. Et voilà! I was now a member of the curly hair club.</p>



<h2>How do you style a Korean digital perm?</h2>



<p>To style my hair, Choi gave me a slight side part, which created a more voluminous look from the scalp. She added some curl cream to define the waves and recommended investing in some good products. Her top tip? “If you have frizzy hair and you want to style it while it’s dry, mix curl cream with a little bit of water in your palms before using it on your hair,” she said. “This helps get rid of the frizz and also hydrates it.”</p>



<p>Styling a digital perm at home isn’t too difficult, either. I have a sensitive scalp, so I’ve purchased some sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. Sulfate-free products will also prolong the perm’s results. I wash my hair with lukewarm water in the shower before scrunching up the curls with a microfiber towel. Next, I add curl cream to define my curls and continue to scrunch them upwards, before using my <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.laifentech.com%2Fproducts%2Flaifen-se-2-high-speed-hair-dryer"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Laifen Hair Dryer</a> (a Dyson dupe) with a diffuser to blow-dry the perm in place. </p>

<h2>How long do you have to wait after a Korean perm to wash your hair?</h2>



<p>Your stylist will let you know how long you should go without washing your perm à la <em>Legally Blonde</em>. For me, I had to wait a minimum of 48 hours before washing my hair after getting my digital perm.</p>



<h2>Can a Korean digital perm cause damage to your hair?</h2>



<p>A digital perm uses chemicals that alter your hair structure and heat to set it in place, so most hairstylists recommend doing it on virgin hair. They also recommend steering clear of perms if your hair is bleached, chemically straightened, or very fine. Bleach in particular weakens the hair by breaking its bonds, which means perm solutions don’t interact well with it. Ultimately, the hair often lacks the strength to hold a set shape, making the process more likely to fail.</p>



<h2>How do you take care of your Korean perm?</h2>



<p>Getting a perm might increase frizz if your hair is prone to it. This is because when the chemical process weakens the hair, it also lifts the cuticle. I’d recommend investing in a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fslip-pure-silk-pillowcase%2F4186794%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopqmzmVbIIqoypAqEzT6eEntgnIoFgt2xwHEu4gn-JL76f3n-bF"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">silk pillowcase</a> or a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fwomens-mulberry-silk-bonnet-with-long-ribbons%2F8701502%3F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">silk bonnet</a> to help keep the frizz to a minimum. Also try a moisturizing leave-in hair product like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fk18-hair-molecular-repair-hair-oil-P505266"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">K18 Biomimetic Hairscience Molecular Repair Hair Oil</a>, which contains peptides, avocado oil, and squalane to help smooth and repair the broken bonds that lead to frizz. </p>



<h2>How do you ask for a Korean digital perm?</h2>



<p>Doing your research and choosing a properly qualified expert is key. I would also recommend bringing reference photos so your stylist can see which kind of curl you are after. It’s also important to discuss your hair health and type, and whether a perm will cause extra frizz or breakage for you. </p>



<p>I can safely say that having a digital perm has led to more conversations about my hair than I’ve had in years — and it looks <em>much</em> healthier than my pastel pink or purple-silver combo. I’m able to wake up with voluminous hair ready to go, and if I need to style it a little bit, I can just use some curl cream, which also helps hydrate my hair. It’s less maintenance than colored hair, so I’m convinced I’m a perm girl for life. </p>
