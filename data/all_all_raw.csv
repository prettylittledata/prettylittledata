The site lies within a densely packed urban area, where most plots range from 2 to 3 cents in extent. This house is built on a 2-cent plot, with only 1 cent dedicated to the built-up area.</p>",

<p>The project is located in La Vicentina, a traditional middle-class neighborhood in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/quito"">Quito</a>, Ecuador. <strong>The location of the lot on a staircase makes it impossible to have parking, but far from being a disadvantage, it aligns with the lifestyle of the owner, who is a frequent bicycle user. </strong>In addition, the hillside topography provides an opportunity to take advantage of the view towards Cerro Auqui. Added to these conditions are the client's needs:<strong> a home for his own use, a smaller one for his daughter, and a versatile common space that can function as a workshop or social area.</strong></p>",

I mapped where intelligence lives, traced where humans direct and where AI executes.</p><p><strong>Here’s what they actually did differently.</strong></p><p><strong>The answer isn’t in the AI models. It’s in how they architect the flow of work between human and AI.</strong></p><p>This is what I call <strong>Intelligence Flow Architecture</strong> — the design of HOW cognitive work flows between human and artificial intelligence. Not what the AI can do, but how the collaboration is structured. Where does intelligence live? Who does what work? How do they hand off tasks?</p><p>This is a design discipline most product teams don’t know exists.</p><figure><img alt=""The essence of Intelligence Flow Architecture: Same models, different flows, completely different results.

Visualization created with Gemini AI.</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>What I mean by “architecture”:</strong> I’m not talking about software architecture (microservices, backend systems) or information architecture (navigation, content structure). I’m talking about <strong>architecting the “how”</strong> — the flow of cognitive work between human and AI. Who does what? Where does intelligence live? How do they collaborate? This is the discipline of designing intelligent systems, not just intelligent features.</p><p>Let me show you exactly how Perplexity and NotebookLM do it — and what you can apply to your own products.</p><h3>The architecture difference</h3><p>Here’s what people miss:</p><p>Both products run on the same foundation — large language models, vector embeddings, search APIs, retrieval-augmented generation.</p><p><strong>Same ingredients. Completely different results.</strong></p><p>Why? Because they architected different <strong>intelligence flows</strong> — different answers to these critical questions:</p><ul><li>WHERE does AI work autonomously?</li><li>WHERE does human provide direction?</li><li>HOW do they hand off work between them?</li><li>WHAT intelligence lives in which layer?</li></ul><blockquote><strong><em>In his </em></strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ""><strong><em>June 2025 keynote at Y Combinator</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Andrej Karpathy — former director of AI at Tesla and OpenAI co-founder — described this exact shift:</em></strong><em> </em>“LLMs aren’t just tools anymore. They’re becoming operating systems. The LLM is the CPU, the context window is the memory, and the real design work is architecting how this new computer orchestrates problem-solving.”</blockquote><p>That’s exactly what Perplexity and NotebookLM understood.</p><p><strong>Watch what happens:</strong></p><p>When you ask <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/"">Perplexity</a> a question, AI doesn’t give you search results to click. It searches, synthesizes, answers, and cites sources — all autonomously.</p><p><strong>Flow:</strong> You direct → AI discovers → You evaluate</p><p>When you upload documents to <a href=""https://notebooklm.google.com/"">NotebookLM</a>, AI doesn’t just “chat about your docs.” It analyzes, maps relationships, and generates insights — without waiting for instructions.</p><p><strong>Flow:</strong> You curate sources → AI orchestrates knowledge → You explore</p><p>These are different architectures of collaboration.</p><p>Let me deconstruct both — layer by layer.</p><h3>Perplexity’s intelligence flow architecture: Real-time discovery</h3><p>What makes Perplexity feel different from Google isn’t better search. It’s a different distribution of cognitive work.</p><h4><strong>THE DESIGN DECISIONS:</strong></h4><p>Someone architected this. Someone decided:</p><ul><li>AI executes search autonomously (you don’t click 10 tabs)</li><li>AI synthesizes while streaming (you don’t wait for batch results)</li><li>AI handles citations in real-time (you don’t copy-paste sources)</li><li>Human directs through conversation (you don’t fill search forms)</li></ul><p><strong>Cognitive split: ~20% Human (direction + evaluation) / 80% AI (discovery + synthesis)</strong></p><p><strong>What this feels like to you as a user:</strong></p><p>You ask a question. Seconds later, you’re reading a synthesized answer with sources — without opening ten browser tabs. It feels like the system “just knows” what you meant and found the answer for you.</p><p>That feeling isn’t magic. <strong>It’s architecture.</strong></p><p>The intelligence lives in the synthesis layer, orchestrating search and combining sources in real-time.</p><figure><img alt=""Perplexity’s 5-layer architecture showing the 20% human / 80% AI cognitive split.

Document understanding.</p><h4><strong>THE DESIGN DECISIONS:</strong></h4><p>Someone architected this. Someone decided:</p><ul><li>AI works only with YOUR documents (not the entire web)</li><li>AI builds knowledge graph invisibly (you experience results, not structure)</li><li>AI generates multiple formats from same knowledge base</li><li>Human curates sources and exploration direction</li></ul><p><strong>Cognitive split: ~30% Human (curation + direction) / 70% AI (analysis + orchestration)</strong></p><p><strong>What this feels like to you as a user:</strong></p><p>You upload research papers. Within seconds, the system “understands” them — not just text search, but conceptual understanding. It finds connections you hadn’t seen. It can explain your own documents back to you in different formats.</p><p>That feeling isn’t magic. <strong>It’s architecture.</strong></p><p>The intelligence lives in the knowledge processing layer, building invisible structure that enables multiple interaction modes.</p><figure><img alt=""NotebookLM’s 5-layer architecture showing the 30% human / 70% AI cognitive split.

Note Layer 4’s gradient — it’s collaborative, where human and AI work together in the interaction loop. </em>Visualization created with Gemini AI.</figcaption></figure><h4>The pattern they both reveal</h4><p>Both succeed because they architected intelligence flows with clear principles.</p><p>(If you look back at the hero infographic at the top, you’ll see the contrast: Traditional AI = features bolted onto existing UIs. Intelligence Flow Architecture = intelligence embedded in the system’s core.)</p><h4><strong>The four principles</strong></h4><h3>Principle 1: Design backward from autonomous execution</h3><p>Don’t start with: <em>“What interface should we show?”</em></p><p>Start with: <em>“What will the system DO autonomously?”</em></p><ul><li>Perplexity: Search + synthesize + cite</li><li>NotebookLM: Analyze + map + generate formats</li></ul><p>Then design everything else to enable that autonomy.</p><p>This inverts traditional software design. Traditional products started with the interface — buttons, menus, workflows — then built backend systems to support them. Intelligence-first architecture starts with autonomous execution and works backward.</p><blockquote><em>The shift is profound: from </em>“How will users accomplish this task?” to “What can the system accomplish autonomously?” <em>As </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_RjOhCkhvQ""><em>Satya Nadella</em></a><em> noted, we’re moving business logic from the application tier to the intelligence tier. The execution layer defines your system’s value — everything else exists to enable it.</em></blockquote><p>Without this inversion, you end up with “AI features” bolted onto traditional interfaces. The intelligence feels like an add-on because it IS an add-on. True intelligence-first architecture means intelligence is embedded as fundamental structure, not added as features.</p><h3>Principle 2: Embed intelligence in specific layers</h3><p>Don’t bolt AI on as features.</p><p>Architect where intelligence lives:</p><ul><li>Perplexity: Intelligence in synthesis layer</li><li>NotebookLM: Intelligence in knowledge processing layer</li></ul><p>The intelligence isn’t visible as “AI feature” — it’s structural.</p><p>The test for embedded intelligence: Can you remove the AI and still have a functional product? If yes, intelligence is bolted on. If no, it’s embedded.</p><p>Perplexity without its synthesis intelligence doesn’t exist — it’s not “Google with AI added,” it’s a fundamentally different architecture where intelligence IS the product. NotebookLM’s knowledge processing layer isn’t a feature you can toggle off; it’s the system’s foundation.</p><p>This architectural embedding happens in specific layers of your five-layer stack. Intelligence doesn’t float everywhere — it concentrates where transformation occurs. In Perplexity, that’s Layer 2 (synthesis orchestration). In NotebookLM, it’s Layer 2 (knowledge graph construction). Identify where YOUR system’s intelligence must live, then build everything to support that layer.</p><h3>Principle 3: Design clear human/AI boundaries</h3><p>Define precisely where AI works autonomously and where human provides direction:</p><ul><li>Perplexity: Human directs → AI discovers → Human evaluates</li><li>NotebookLM: Human curates → AI orchestrates → Human explores</li></ul><blockquote><strong><em>Think of this as creating control maps — the new journey maps for AI experiences.</em></strong><em> Instead of mapping what users do, you map who is in control (user, AI, or both) and when that control shifts. As </em><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/from-journey-maps-to-control-maps-17aac58b9dd9""><em>Rob Chappell</em></a><em> notes, </em>“The question is no longer ‘What is the user trying to do?’ The more relevant question is: ‘Who is in control at this moment, and how does that shift?’”</blockquote><p>This is the evolution from traditional user journeys to human-AI collaboration flows.</p><p><strong>This pattern is becoming so clear that in June 2025, Karpathy dedicated his Y Combinator keynote to it.</strong> He calls it “partial autonomy” — systems where AI generates and humans verify in a continuous loop.</p><p>The architectural insight: <strong>The fastest generation-verification loop wins. Not the most autonomous AI.</strong></p><p>That’s why <a href=""https://cursor.com/"">Cursor</a> (coding), Perplexity (search), and NotebookLM (research) are succeeding — they optimized the loop, not the autonomy.</p><h3>Principle 4: Optimize for cognitive distribution</h3><p>Not: “Can AI do this task?”</p><p>But: “SHOULD AI do this, or SHOULD human?”</p><ul><li><strong>Human strengths:</strong> Goal definition, judgment, creative direction, evaluation</li><li><strong>AI strengths:</strong> Discovery, synthesis, pattern recognition, execution</li></ul><p>Both products make this mapping explicit in their architecture.</p><p>This requires mapping cognitive strengths systematically. From your Hybrid Cognition Map: Humans excel at goal definition, context understanding, judgment calls, ambiguity resolution, ethical decisions, creative direction, and stakeholder intuition. AI excels at information retrieval, pattern recognition, rapid iteration, consistency, tedious execution, multi-source synthesis, and 24/7 availability.</p><p>The magic happens at the intersection — not human OR AI, but human AND AI working in complementary strengths. Perplexity distributes: human defines information need (judgment), AI discovers and synthesizes (execution). NotebookLM distributes: human curates sources (context), AI processes and orchestrates (synthesis).</p><p>Poor cognitive distribution creates friction. If you ask humans to do what AI does better (tedious data processing), or ask AI to do what humans do better (strategic judgment), the collaboration fails. Design explicitly for strengths, not just capabilities.</p><figure><img alt=""The complete framework: Four principles that define how Perplexity and NotebookLM architect human-AI collaboration.

I took photos of the worksheet, showed them to an AI, and asked it to generate similar exercises. Seconds later: a new practice set, perfectly matched to her level.</p><p>She finished it. Asked for another. I already had everything loaded — another set appeared in seconds.</p><p><strong>This wasn’t impressive because the AI was smart.</strong> It was impressive because I’d designed the <strong>how</strong>: Photo → Parse → Generate → Verify → Iterate. A five-second intelligence flow that would have taken me 30 minutes manually.</p><p>That’s Intelligence Flow Architecture in daily life.</p><p>Now let’s make it actionable for your team.</p><h3>From analysis to application</h3><p>You’ve seen how Perplexity and NotebookLM architect intelligence flows.</p><p>Now let’s make this actionable for your team.</p><p>The method works for any product workflow — from email to CRM to document editing.</p><p>Here’s the four-step process:</p><h3>How to apply intelligence flow architecture to your product</h3><h4><strong>STEP 1: Map your current workflow</strong></h4><p>Pick one core workflow. List every step users do manually.</p><h4><strong>STEP 2: Identify cognitive work</strong></h4><p>For each step, ask:</p><ul><li>Is this discovery work? (AI strength)</li><li>Is this synthesis? (AI strength)</li><li>Is this judgment? (Human strength)</li><li>Is this goal-setting? (Human strength)</li></ul><h4><strong>STEP 3: Design the intelligence flow</strong></h4><p>Redistribute work:</p><ul><li>What should AI do autonomously?</li><li>Where does human direct?</li><li>What are the handoff points?</li></ul><h4><strong>STEP 4: Design backward from execution</strong></h4><ul><li>What will AI execute? (execution layer)</li><li>What intelligence enables that? (intelligence layer)</li><li>How do systems coordinate? (orchestration layer)</li><li>How does human express intention? (input layer)</li></ul><h4><strong>Example: Redesigning email with Intelligence Flow Architecture</strong></h4><p>Let’s make this concrete. Here’s how Intelligence Flow Architecture transforms a common workflow — email composition.</p><p>Traditional Gmail requires you to manually type, edit, format, and send — roughly 5 minutes of writing every word. Intelligence Flow Architecture redesigns this as a 6-layer collaboration where AI handles autonomous execution while you provide direction and judgment.</p><p>The result: 30 seconds instead of 5 minutes. Directing instead of writing.</p><figure><img alt=""Email workflow transformation: Traditional Gmail requires 5 minutes of manual writing.

The Tesla lesson</h3><p>Before we dive into what this means for product teams, let’s address the obvious question: <strong>Why design for partial autonomy instead of full autonomous agents?</strong></p><p>In his June 2025 keynote, Karpathy shared a telling story from his five years building autonomous systems at Tesla:</p><p>In 2013, he took a perfect self-driving ride in a Waymo — zero interventions, flawless. He thought: “Self-driving is imminent.”</p><p><strong>That was 12 years ago.</strong> Even now, <a href=""https://waymo.com/"">Waymo vehicles</a> that appear driverless still require significant human teleoperation and oversight.</p><blockquote><strong><em>His warning applies directly to product design:</em></strong><em> When AI generates massive outputs — 10,000 lines of code, complete research reports, fully redesigned interfaces — you haven’t saved time if verification takes hours. </em>“When I see things like ‘oh 2025 is the year of agents,’ I get very concerned. This is the <strong>decade</strong> of agents.”</blockquote><blockquote><strong>“We have to keep the AI on the leash,”</strong> <em>Karpathy emphasized. Not because AI isn’t capable, but because </em><strong><em>verification speed determines actual productivity.</em></strong></blockquote><p>This is why Intelligence Flow Architecture prioritizes the generation-verification loop over full autonomy. The goal isn’t to remove humans from the loop. <strong>The goal is to make the loop spin as fast as possible.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Karpathy’s lesson from 12 years at Tesla: Fast generation-verification loops beat pursuing full autonomy. Loop speed determines productivity, not autonomy level."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2OemyGgIYm1AjKuiQUmbuQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Karpathy’s lesson from 12 years at Tesla: Fast generation-verification </em>loops beat pursuing full autonomy. Loop speed determines productivity, <em>not autonomy level. </em>Visualization created with Gemini AI.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>A note for designers:</strong> You might be thinking “I’m not a system architect. Can I actually apply this?” Yes. Intelligence Flow Architecture isn’t about backend engineering — it’s about design thinking applied to human-AI collaboration. Start small: Pick one workflow. Map where human directs vs where AI executes. That’s architecting intelligence flows. You’re already doing this thinking — now you have language for it.</p><h3>What this means for product teams</h3><p>Here’s what changes when you adopt Intelligence Flow Architecture:</p><h4><strong>BEFORE (AI Features):</strong></h4><ul><li>PM says: “Let’s add AI to this workflow”</li><li>Designer asks: “What should the AI button look like?”</li><li>Engineer builds: API call to GPT → show response</li><li>Result: Feature that feels bolted on</li></ul><h4><strong>AFTER (Intelligence Flow Architecture):</strong></h4><ul><li>PM asks: “What cognitive work should AI handle autonomously?”</li><li>Designer maps: Human direction → AI execution → Human evaluation</li><li>Engineer architects: Intelligence layer + orchestration layer + execution layer</li><li>Result: System that feels intelligent</li></ul><h3><strong>The pattern</strong></h3><p>Perplexity and NotebookLM didn’t ask “How do we add AI?”</p><p>They asked: “How do we architect collaboration between human and artificial intelligence?”</p><p>That’s the difference between an AI feature and an intelligent system.</p><p>That’s Intelligence Flow Architecture.</p><p>And that framework — deciding where intelligence lives, how work distributes, when systems execute autonomously — <strong>that’s intelligence-first architecture.</strong></p><p><strong>Same AI models.</strong><br /><strong>Different architecture.</strong><br /><strong>Completely different experience.</strong></p><p>Now you know why.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ace59eeda531"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/perplexity-and-notebooklm-dont-use-better-ai-they-use-better-intelligence-flow-architecture-ace59eeda531"">Perplexity and NotebookLM don’t use better AI—they use better intelligence flow architecture</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Despite its limited design, many users felt understood and emotionally “seen,” attributing empathy and intent to the system, a phenomenon later called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect""><strong>“ELIZA effect</strong></a><strong>”. </strong>From the very start, people related to even basic conversational software as if it had a mind of its own.</p><p>Long before modern AI, product and brand design had already embraced personality as a differentiator. <a href=""https://imgs.search.brave.com/bGxPgSeNEiF9Eug7c4YNn_bgulI2vwDeCDJqyq_KKtU/rs:fit:860:0:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9kMmlq/ejZvNXhheTF4cS5j/bG91ZGZyb250Lm5l/dC9hY2NvdW50XzQ4/MS9TY3JlZW5zaG90/MjAxOC0xMS0wOGF0/MTFfMDRfMThBTV81/NDI1N2M0MTI4M2Mx/NWI0YTMxNTRiNjMz/ZDRlY2IxNV84MDAu/cG5n"">Mailchimp’s playful feedback</a> or <a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/slack-copywriting-what-they-say-to-9-6-million-pageviews-every-month-4351888f1c2c"">Slack’s quirky copywriting</a> showed how tone and character could give otherwise functional software a distinctive emotional presence.

A caption explains that Miko robots have rich backstories users uncover through conversation."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MXwMEzP9HuRskUPhuce0Bw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Some successful consumer products which follow this pattern strongly are</p><ul><li><a href=""http://www.miko.ai""><strong>Miko</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The companion robot invites children to ask, <em>“Where did you come from?”, “What’s your job?”, “Are you a boy or a girl?”</em> — revealing his backstory and personality through playful dialogue.</li><li><a href=""https://www.tolans.com/""><strong>Tolan</strong></a><strong>:</strong> General-purpose assistants take on the persona of friendly aliens from planet Portolah, each arriving with distinct personalities and quirks to befriend their human companions</li><li><a href=""https://character.ai/""><strong>Character.ai</strong></a><strong>:</strong> A massive platform where users chat with millions of AI characters, each with detailed backstories, personalities and fictional histories to explore.</li></ul><h3>4. Context adaptation</h3><p>Contextual adaptation is the AI’s ability to respond appropriately to a user’s <strong>situational context or emotional state</strong> and shaping tone, language, and pacing to feel human and supportive.</p><p>This relies on techniques like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_recognition""><strong>emotional state recognition</strong></a> (detecting sentiment or tone), <a href=""https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/ai-mirroring-behaviors""><strong>conversational mirroring</strong></a> (reflecting the user’s phrasing or energy), and <strong>contextual personality shifting</strong> (adjusting tone or style based on task complexity or user mood) .</p><ul><li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa""><strong>Alexa</strong></a>, though simpler, varies its vocal delivery: sounding excited when offering good news (“It’s sunny all day!”) or disappointed when reporting a loss, reinforcing its role as a helpful household companion.</li><li><a href=""https://answeringagent.com/blog/5-ways-ai-adapts-tone-for-customer-calls""><strong>T-Mobile’s AI</strong> reduced customer complaints by 73%</a> through instant detection of negative sentiment and tone mirroring</li><li><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.replika.app&amp;hl=en_IN&amp;pli=1""><strong>Replika</strong></a>, performs deep, long-term mirroring. It learns a user’s vocabulary, emotional patterns, and interaction style over many conversations, gradually shaping its own language, tone, and even “personality” to reflect the individual.</li></ul><h3>5. Visual identity</h3><p>Visual identity is often the first layer through which users infer an AI product’s personality. Design decisions around logo, avatar, color, type and even hardware shapes cues.</p><figure><img alt=""Image showing Perplexity’s geometric logo, Claude’s serif typography, and the Lovot robot. A caption notes that Claude’s serifs feel warm and credible, Perplexity’s sans-serif feels modern and analytical, and Lovot’s soft design conveys a companion-like personality."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sQ7i9Nt3p9T041kdfEAYoQ.jpeg"" /></figure><ul><li><strong>Logo/ Avatar/ Embodied identity </strong>give an AI a recognizable “face” and act as an immediate proxy for personality. For instance, <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/"">Perplexity</a>’s logo, is minimal, geometric, and abstract and it subtly animates during search to cue users that AI is creating an answer. On the other end of the spectrum, more expressive AI products like <a href=""https://lovot.life/en/"">Lovot</a> uses a physical body, large eyes, soft materials, and even personalised clothing to project warmth, affection, and a companion-like presence.</li><li><strong>Typography</strong> contributes to brand voice in chat interfaces. For example, <strong>Claude’s serif typography conveys</strong> warmth, maturity, and approachability — qualities that align with its thoughtful, privacy-first positioning. <strong>Perplexity’s geometric sans-serif communicates</strong> modern technical clarity and reliability, reinforcing its role as a precise, research-oriented tool.</li><li><strong>Illustrations/ Imagery:</strong> Supports communicating information in a delightful way</li><li><strong>Motion and Animation: </strong>Motion guidelines define how elements animate, transition, and respond to user interaction.</li><li><strong>Color palette</strong> reinforce AI personality archetypes by leveraging emotional associations rooted in color psychology. For example. blue signals trust and calm (Alexa), bright green colours signal playfulness and growth (Duolingo, Miko) and muted tones as professionalism (Notion AI).</li></ul><h3>6. Communication style &amp; copy</h3><p>Communication style and copy are also the most visible expressions of an AI’s personality. Whether experienced through <strong>voice or text,</strong> elements like <strong>tone</strong>, <strong>phrasing</strong>, <strong>pacing</strong>, <strong>formality </strong>work together to communicate character’s personality and guide user experience.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Duolingo’s writing guidelines page showing the section on ‘Voice’. It describes how Duolingo’s brand personality appears through words, supported by four voice qualities — expressive, playful, embracing and worldly — with a sidebar menu on the left and an illustration on top"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZOGg6drhwqpcvegAtbKosw.jpeg"" /></figure><h4>Core elements shared across voice and chat interfaces</h4><ul><li><strong>Tone</strong> sets the emotional posture: formal tones (e.g., <em>Sage</em>, <em>Ruler</em>) project authority and professionalism, while informal tones (e.g., <em>Everyman</em>, <em>Jester</em>) build warmth and approachability. For example, <a href=""https://www.capitalone.com/digital/tools/eno/"">Capital One’s Eno</a> uses “First things first” is perceived as friendlier than “Here is the first step” in user research.</li><li><strong>Phrasing and vocabulary</strong> reflect personality cues. For instance, a Caregiver might say “<em>“Let me walk you through this , we’ll figure it out together,”</em>,” while Sage personas might use precise, technical terms (e.g., “<em>“Let me explain the details step by step</em>”).</li><li><strong>Pacing and prosody</strong> (in voice), or <strong>structure and grammar</strong> (in text), shape rhythm and emphasis which is key to emotional delivery and comprehension. Models from <a href=""https://elevenlabs.io/docs/models"">ElevanLabs V3</a> and <a href=""https://cartesia.ai/sonic"">Cartesia</a> uses intentional pauses and inflection to simulate human-like and expressive speech generation.</li></ul><h4>Modality differences: Voice vs. Chat</h4><p>Voice-first interfaces (e.g., Alexa, Miko) rely heavily on <strong>prosody, timing, and conversational repair</strong>. Spoken interactions are adaptive — users naturally adjust tone, pacing, or emphasis when there’s confusion.</p><p>In contrast, chat-based interfaces (e.g., Claude, Perplexity) emphasize <strong>structural clarity, grammar, and concise phrasing</strong>. Because written responses can’t be corrected mid-delivery, users expect a higher degree of accuracy and polish.</p><h3>7. Multimodal feedback</h3><p><strong>Multimodal feedback</strong> refers to the way an AI system expresses its internal states such as listening, thinking, processing, or responding sometime called <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/chain-of-thoughts""><strong>Chain-of-thought (CoT)</strong></a><strong> display </strong>through various visual design elements and multiple sensory channels. These channels can include <strong>visual cues</strong>, <strong>voice and sound design</strong>, <strong>micro-animations</strong>, <strong>LED lights</strong>, or <strong>haptics</strong>.</p><p><strong>It allows users to <em>see</em>, <em>hear</em> or <em>feel</em> what the AI is doing</strong>, making the interaction more interpretable, human-like and trustworthy.</p><figure><img alt=""Four examples of AI systems showing how they express internal state: Replit panels with micro-animations for thinking steps; Alexa device with LED ring phases — idle, listening, thinking, speaking; Duolingo voice call using animated character face; Moxie robot using voice, eyes, and body movement"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2C-JnFqBHXrmlqKoxgfg-g.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Multimodal feedback varies across products depending on how much personality is intended for the product.</p><ul><li><a href=""https://replit.com/ai"">Replit AI</a>, <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/"">Perplexity</a>, <a href=""https://claude.ai/"">Claude</a><strong> </strong>relies on <strong>icon animations</strong> and <strong>microcopy</strong> to communicates system states.</li><li>Alexa devices like <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B8V1LZ3?ref=amzdv_ucc_dp_lod__B09B8V1LZ3&amp;th=1"">Echo dot</a> uses <strong>LED lights</strong>, <strong>voice tone</strong> and <strong>sound effects</strong> to express internal states. The glowing ring is soft and household-friendly, reinforcing her calm, helpful persona.</li><li><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/moxierobot/"">Moxie</a> robot<strong> </strong>combines <strong>voice and non verbal cues </strong>— screen animations, sound effects and hand and body movements<strong> </strong>to communicate states in a child-friendly, playful way consistent with its worldview of empathy and curiosity.</li></ul><h4><strong>Interaction rhythm and timing</strong></h4><p>Interaction rhythm and timing are critical to how AI systems communicate through multimodal cues. Research in human–robot interaction (Michalowski et al., 2007; Hoffman &amp; Breazeal, 2007; Breazeal, 2003) shows when robots align their timing with humans — pausing at the right moments, matching conversational pacing, or synchronizing gesture and gaze —<strong> interactions feel more alive</strong>, more engaging<strong>, more lifelike, and more trustworthy</strong>.</p><p>Products like <strong>Tolans</strong> use coordinated animations, eye-gaze, and motion timing to signal attention and emotional states, making the characters feel alive. Voice agents like <strong>Alexa</strong> similarly use rhythmic cues — brief pauses, LED pulses, and vocal pacing — to create a sense of responsiveness. In both cases, achieving the right timing transforms abstract AI behaviour into something that feels intentional, expressive, and socially fluent.</p><h3>When does personality matter?</h3><p>The fundamental question to ask before designing for personality, if your product needs one and how complex?</p><p>Not every AI system needs a quirky mascot or empathetic voice. The role of personality depends on what problem the product is solving and what users expect from AI<em>.</em></p><figure><img alt=""This chart provides a relative comparison of each product based on how many personality patterns it uses and the depth of their implementation. A more detailed scoring breakdown will be released in a separate article"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MVIKD6P88sCcG2q5gd0IIQ.jpeg"" /></figure><p><strong>In enterprise, B2B SaaS, </strong>or high-utility applications<strong>, personality is kept limited </strong>like professional tone, clear explanations and minimal flair as seen in tools like Ema, Salesforce Einstein or Intercom where u<a href=""http://www.ijdesign.org/index.php/IJDesign/article/view/861/366"">sers value accuracy, compliance, and integration</a>.</p><p><strong>In</strong> <strong>consumer AI</strong>,<strong> personality is often the differentiator</strong> driving engagement, trust, and habit-building where functionality is commoditized. Duolingo’s cheeky Duo, Miko’s playful child companion, Alexa’s polite household voice, Claude’s thoughtful collaborator persona, and Lovable’s friendly co-creative tone all show how personality, delights, stickiness, and emotional connection become as important as utility itself.</p><h3>References</h3><ul><li><a href=""https://www.anthropic.com/research/collective-constitutional-ai-aligning-a-language-model-with-public-input""><strong>Collective Constitutional AI</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Aligning a Language Model with Public Input by Anthropic</li><li><a href=""https://www.anthropic.com/news/introducing-claude""><strong>Introducing Claude</strong></a> (March 2023) by Anthropic</li><li><a href=""https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262533485/hamlet-on-the-holodeck/""><strong>Hamlet on the Holodeck</strong></a>: The future of narrative in cyberspace.

<h4><strong>The comfort and the cost of knowing what’s next.</strong></h4><figure><img alt=""A product roadmap displayed on a reddish-brown background.

Mo"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6VG6wG73XifozBos5j4EPA.png"" /><figcaption>An example of a feature-based roadmap</figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong><em>Imagine this scenario:<br /></em></strong>You are working with a passionate founder. They want to build a product which they are super sure of; they have their pitch deck ready, investors are lined up, and they want to hit market in six months. All they need is a working product: an embodiment of their mission. As a product manager, you do the usual. In a short duration, you conjure up enough details to come up with a roadmap. A plan with all the required features to put the product in the hands of potential users. It is well-detailed, with release dates and launch timelines. You align the team and start development. <strong>What could go wrong?</strong></blockquote><p>Working constantly with early-stage startups has taught me one thing: startups are a minefield of uncertainty. If a founder believes they have all their answers on <strong>day one, </strong>they pretty much have a dream to sell you. It might just say that on the pitch deck.</p><p>In my experience, anything a startup builds in its early stages is a whole lot of assumptions wrapped around a concrete vision. When you start treating these assumptions as ground reality and planning features rather than outcomes, you create a recipe for trouble. A well-documented, timeline-based feature roadmap is often where the problem starts.</p><p>These plans actually give founder and teams a false sense of security. However, teams very quickly realise that:</p><p><strong>Feature roadmaps limit exploration and discovery. </strong>If the boundaries of exploration are limited to a predefined feature set, you quickly find yourself boxed in. Instead of giving the team ample time to actually solve problems, you end up preparing for the next release cycle as the team focuses on building the current feature on the list.</p><p><strong>Feature roadmaps leave little room for new information.</strong> These plans operate under the conviction that all underlying assumptions have been fully priced in, locking potential ideas, features, and deadlines in advance.</p><p>However, as you start working on the product, the <strong><em>act of building</em></strong> itself brings significant clarity. New information either challenges or validates previously made assumptions. As a result, you are compelled to carve out a new shape for the product — one that reflects an evolved understanding, sometimes with a focus on revised outcomes.</p><p>This is where feature roadmaps fail to adapt. They are built for predictability, and any change often leads to delays or scope expansion. You then have to resist new ideas and information just to stay on track with previously set timelines.</p><p><strong>Feature roadmaps have a confidence bias. </strong>They inherently believe that the solution, from the outset, is already fit for the market in its current shape. What is supposed to be a strategic and continuous discovery turns into a scheduling exercise. In reality, just because you are solving the right problem doesn’t mean the current shape of the product will perform well in the market.</p><p><strong>Feature roadmaps underestimate the invisible work.</strong> Development teams often require a fair amount of time and effort to figure out the <em>right</em> way to build before dipping their hands into execution. This is difficult to plan for, as the paths of discovery are not always linear. Sometimes you have to spend more time delivering the same planned item. The timeline is affected not by new demands, but by a well-defined scope.</p><blockquote><em>A PM I know used to say ‘</em><strong><em>Roadmaps are the glue that makes strategy stick to planning’. </em></strong><em>Lately, I feel the longer they are planned for, the </em><strong><em>harder</em></strong><em> they set in, making things very difficult and </em><strong><em>costly</em></strong><em> to pull away.</em></blockquote><p>Don’t get me wrong. I am not saying they are a bad exercise. Early-stage startups <strong>need</strong> to have a vision and a pathway to get there, and roadmaps serve that purpose effectively. What I do take issue with is the way of thinking that propagates building ‘all the things we thought were correct <strong>then</strong>’ at the cost of ‘what we know <strong>now’,</strong> treating previous ideas as gospel truth. A product being built just for the sake of it. It’s a lose-lose situation for everyone.</p><p>So, what’s the alternative?</p><ol><li><strong>Building roadmaps around outcomes, not features. </strong>This gives your team the agility to adapt to one of the umpteen pathways that could be used to arrive at the desired outcome. Outcome-focused roadmaps also ensure that the team focuses on solving the problem at hand and not just checking stories off a to-do list.</li><li><strong>Make clarity your top priority. </strong>Be it through initial research, alpha releases, or targeted experiments, your first three months should focus on validating your assumptions. These will help you plan a more robust roadmap, rather than building a product on ideas made of sand.</li><li><strong>Use the 666 method. </strong>A way of mapping horizons based on what your startup needs to focus on over the next <strong>6 years, 6 months, and 6 weeks</strong>.</li></ol><ul><li><strong>Next 6 years. </strong>This is your north star, the team’s vision of the future six years from now. This will change and evolve as your team learns how your product is built, adopted, and integrated into your users’ lives. Please do not create a fixed plan for six years.</li><li><strong>Next 6 months. </strong>This is your pathway of putting the product in front of your users for the very first time. It is a culmination of all your current beliefs, learnings and insights. The team should assume that only 50–60% of this plan will actually get built. The rest will emerge based on what you discover along the way, creating a need to revisit and revise this plan every couple of months.</li><li><strong>Next 6 weeks. </strong>This is where a feature roadmap makes sense. Once your team is confident on what needs to be built next, create a small, focused plan. Once locked in, changes here should be minimal. Make sure you know what you want to learn from the outcome of these six weeks. <strong>This is the only horizon where going granular is appropriate.</strong></li></ul><p><em>Lastly, learn to </em><strong><em>balance</em></strong><em> and </em><strong><em>realign</em></strong><em>. Planning works best when delivery and discovery are mapped together, each informing and correcting the other.</em></p><p>References:</p><ul><li>Yojji: Roadmap Startup Guide &amp; Examples: <a href=""https://yojji.io/blog/roadmap-startup-guide-examples"">https://yojji.io/blog/roadmap-startup-guide-examples</a></li><li>Clarify: The Art of Product Roadmapping for Early-Stage SaaS Founders: <a href=""https://www.clarify.ai/blog/the-art-of-product-roadmapping-for-early-stage-saas-founders"">https://www.clarify.ai/blog/the-art-of-product-roadmapping-for-early-stage-saas-founders</a></li><li>Product School: Now–Next–Later Roadmap Framework: <a href=""https://productschool.com/blog/product-strategy/now-next-later-roadmap"">https://productschool.com/blog/product-strategy/now-next-later-roadmap</a></li><li>Product plan: Product roadmaps for startups vs enterprises: <a href=""https://www.productplan.com/learn/product-roadmaps-startups-versus-enterprises/"">https://www.productplan.com/learn/product-roadmaps-startups-versus-enterprises/</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9360d392758b"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/why-feature-roadmaps-dont-work-for-early-stage-startups-9360d392758b"">Why feature roadmaps don’t work for early-stage startups</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

But don’t confuse this agility with a lack of strength, focus, or clear objectives; true growth demands disciplined alignment to build lasting foundations.</em></p><p>This article is suited for UX growth-focused professional, product people, or startups that speak the language of business, tying insights to money, time, or risk.</p><p>As a User experience growth focused, my design process is governed by a series of questions:</p><p>“Have I defined the right problem?”</p><p>“Am I getting clear insights, or is there bias?”</p><p>“How might I solve it?”</p><p>“Is this the best solution?”</p><p>“How does it work?”</p><p>“What should I measure?”</p><p>“What risks might it create? How’s the future stage or future enhancement?”</p><p>“Does it impact both the business and the users positively?”</p><p>This mindset isn’t just good UX, it’s the bedrock of sustainable growth. Too often, companies chase growth at all costs, only to discover their foundation is crumbling. They scale a product people don’t love, solve problems users don’t have, and burn resources on ineffective experiments.</p><p>Let’s take a look at Workday, it’s a powerful HR and finance platform often criticized for its frustrating user experience, especially in the job application process. You guys, who’s ever tried Workday? We might know this isn’t an isolated issue. The Baymard Institute found that nearly 70% of online shopping carts are abandoned, largely due to poor UX.</p><p>This is the exact problem Product-Led Growth (PLG) aims to solve. In simple terms, PLG means your product itself becomes the primary engine for user acquisition, conversion, and retention. It’s a philosophy that forces design, marketing, sales, and engineering to align around the user experience. Often, this activity proceeds by a growth team who orchestrates but the skeleton is strategy + user experience.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6tb4w2wxyLCitsGdRh_0Dw.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://share.google/7WzjN5Ur51rKjUsEm""><em>The Product-Led Prism</em></a><em> by </em>www.productled.org</figcaption></figure><p>But there’s a catch.</p><h4><strong>The Foundation: Product-Market Fit</strong></h4><p>A business can only focus on true, scalable growth after achieving product-market fit.

Scaling beforehand is like building a skyscraper on sand.</p><h4><strong>The Pitfall: Confusing Speed with Strength</strong></h4><p>The pressure to grow fast, especially in early-stage startups, can be deafening. But speed without direction leads to failure.</p><p>An experienced business strategist, Yulia Neicovcean, illustrates two scenarios:</p><blockquote>“…</blockquote><blockquote>Scenario 1: Growth That Lasts</blockquote><blockquote>Companies decided early to build structure solid CRM, client retention strategies, and a focus on prime communities. They didn’t try to do everything. They specialized. As the market shifted, their brand held strong, and they kept growing steadily instead of burning out.</blockquote><blockquote>Scenario 2: Failure in Fast-Forward</blockquote><blockquote>Another company scaled aggressively hiring quickly, chasing every new trend, ignoring compliance and fundamentals. For a year it looked like they were unstoppable. But when regulations tightened and clients demanded quality over quantity, the cracks showed. Within two years, they went from “the next big thing” to closing their doors.</blockquote><blockquote>The lesson is clear:</blockquote><blockquote>Growth is not proof of success; sustainability is. “</blockquote><p>This is where two powerful frameworks come together to create a solution.</p><p><strong>1. McKinsey’s Three Horizons of Growth: The Strategic Compass</strong></p><p>The McKinsey Three Horizons model first introduced in The Alchemy of Growth (1999) remains a valuable tool for prioritizing innovation. However, its traditional interpretation has a critical blind spot in the digital age.</p><p>The original model suggests that disruptive innovations (Horizon 3) emerge from long research and development cycles. While this is still true for fields like biotech or energy, the modern trap is failing to recognize that today’s most powerful disruptions often skip this lengthy phase.</p><p>Instead, they are achieved by repurposing existing, mature technologies — like cloud computing, APIs, and mobile platforms — into radical new business models. This is where strategy and user experience intersect:</p><ul><li><strong>Disruption Lies in Business Model &amp; UX: </strong>Companies like Uber, Airbnb, and Instagram didn’t invent new core technologies (GPS, online payments, photo-sharing). They leveraged existing ones to create a fundamentally superior and seamless user experience, which in turn defined a new business model.</li><li><strong>Speed as a Disruptive Force: </strong>The ability to rapidly deploy these experience-driven models creates a powerful advantage. A competitor stuck in the old Horizon 3 mindset is still in R&amp;D, while a UX-focused competitor has already captured the market.</li></ul><p>Therefore, the framework is still useful for categorizing ambitions, but its value for planning disruption is limited. Its full potential is only unlocked when integrated with a deep understanding of how existing technology can be reimagined through user-centric design to create immediate, market-changing value.</p><p><strong>The model guides you to balance your focus across three time horizons:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Horizon 1 (H1): Your Core Business. </strong>This is what pays the bills today. Initiatives here focus on optimizing, defending, and growing your existing operations (e.g., improving checkout conversion rates).</li><li><strong>Horizon 2 (H2): Emerging Opportunities. </strong>These are new ventures that are expected to become your core business in the next 1–3 years (e.g., launching a new product line or entering a new market).</li><li><strong>Horizon 3 (H3): Future Bets. </strong>These are long-term ideas and experiments that could define your future (e.g., R&amp;D for a disruptive technology).</li></ul><p>The failed company in Scenario 2 was likely chasing H3 dreams without a profitable H1 foundation. A sustainable strategy requires actively managing all three.</p><p><strong>2. UXR as a Product Discovery Mindset: The Reality Check</strong></p><p>As Marty Cagan notes in his book INSPIRED, “<em>The few that succeed are usually those that are really good at the product discovery phase</em>.” This is where User Experience Research (UXR) evolves from a mere task into a core mindset.</p><p>It’s the continuous practice of asking:</p><ul><li>“Are we solving the right problem?”</li><li>“Will users actually use this?”</li><li>“Can we build a viable business around it?”</li></ul><p>This UXR mindset is the solution to the “Three Horizons trap.” It replaces long, risky R&amp;D cycles in H3 with a culture of continuous learning, ensuring strategy is guided by evidence from the very beginning.</p><p>This isn’t about occasional testing, it’s about rapidly identifying hidden opportunities to repurpose our existing technologies to solve real user problems with the right analysis. This approach enables the fast, asymmetric disruptions that define modern, sustainable growth.</p><p>This is why I created the Sustainable Growth Flowchart. It’s a practical map that combines these two frameworks, ensuring every growth initiative is grounded in both strategic business planning and user reality.</p><h3><strong>The Sustainable Growth Flowchart: </strong>The Intersection of Business Strategy and User Experience</h3><p>For downloadable file: <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W4pklZ8LLiq68oFk2M32W3cekI-YxhgN/view?usp=drive_link"">check here</a></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Wy-LruGuoDkG0x0dZt4f5Q.png"" /><figcaption>The Intersection of Business Strategy and User Experience — By Lismayasari Annisyah</figcaption></figure><p>Let’s walk through the key decision gates. The entire process is a cycle, governed by ‘Monitor, Measure, and Adapt.’</p><ol><li>Begin with a Ruthless Audit: Defining the Right Problem</li></ol><p>The flowchart starts here because launching into solutions without validating the core problem is a fundamental failure mode in UX and product design. This step embodies a user research (UXR) mindset, systematically deconstructing assumptions through methods such as analytics review, user interviews, surveys, competitive analysis, or journey mapping. The term “ruthless” signifies a commitment to brutal honesty and a willingness to kill ideas if data reveals they are misaligned or ineffective. This audit is not a one-time event; it’s a process for uncovering latent opportunities, such as unmet user needs that could drive retention or acquisition.</p><p>I watched Melanie Perkins, Co-founder and CEO of Canva, explain in Founder Story interviews that their core mission was to “democratize design” making design accessible to non-designers rather than simply adding features to complex tools. Through user research and analytics, they refined the problem statement, which led to a simplified interface and increased adoption among users who were not design experts.</p><p>As I’m in a SaaS product, this might involve auditing my onboarding flow. If drop-off rates are high, user interviews could uncover confusing UX patterns, prompting a redesign that aligns with users’ mental models. Incorporating tools like heatmaps (e.g., Hotjar) is one of many methods that can be used to help identify cognitive biases in our assumptions, ensuring the problem is validated by users (the right problem), not ego-driven.</p><p>2. The First Critical Gate: Product-Market Fit (PMF)</p><p>This is the flowchart’s decisive checkpoint: “Have we achieved Product-Market Fit?” If not, the directive is to return to research; scaling is not permitted. PMF means your product solves a real problem for a well-defined market so effectively that users become habitual adopters. UXR verifies this by connecting to problem/solution fit, GAP analysis, value proposition clarity, Bayesian analysis, or mixed-method research. Also, see metrics like retention, churn rates, or any metrics that fit our business type. Bypassing this gate means investing resources into what the flowchart calls a “broken engine.”</p><p>I read ‘The Slack Origin Story’ by Techcrunch, they explained that Slack serves as a classic example, as it pivoted from a gaming tool to a team communication platform after internal data showed skyrocketing adoption within their own team. Early PMF was validated through strong engagement metrics and user feedback, which justified scaling efforts. Regarding this, UX people can conduct cohort analysis, if users return daily and refer others, you likely have PMF.</p><p>If not, iterate on core features using qualitative insights, bayesian analysis, the buyer’s/user journey, or any method that can map the system.</p><p>We maybe familiar with Airbnb, they achieved PMF by focusing on high-quality photos and trust-building UX elements, converting skeptical users into advocates. This gate prevents startups from burning capital on unvalidated ideas, reinforcing user experience as the foundation of market resonance.</p><p>3. Set Goals and Select Your Lever: Balancing Growth Strategies</p><p>Once PMF is confirmed, the flowchart directs you to establish measurable goals such as KPIs for user acquisition or churn reduction and choose appropriate growth levers. This draws on the Ansoff Matrix: Market Penetration (deepening engagement within existing markets), Product Development (building new features for current users), Market Development (bringing existing products to new markets), or Diversification (launching new products in new markets). It’s critical to align these with strategic time horizons: H1 (short-term optimization), H2 (medium-term expansion), and H3 (long-term innovation) ensuring sustainability without overextending resources. This means UX practitioners can recommend a lever prioritize that enhance user delight, while the company sets up strategic resource allocation.</p><p>Spotify as our favorite music player, for instance, they employed Product Development (H2) by introducing personalized playlists, which increased retention among existing users, while also pursuing Market Penetration (H1) through free-tier offerings in new regions.</p><p>For example, if we have a goal to double user growth, we might choose Market Penetration via UX improvements like a seamless referral program while investing in H3 diversification such as AI-powered features.</p><p>Quartr.com explained that Netflix successfully diversified into original content (H3) after saturating its core streaming market, using data to guide decisions. This balanced approach avoids the “growth at all costs” trap, ensuring UX drives long-term value.</p><p>4. The Alignment Check: The PLG Litmus Test</p><p>Before execution, the flowchart mandates asking: “Are cross-functional teams aligned and adequately funded?” This step operationalizes Product-Led Growth (PLG), where the product itself through intuitive UX drives acquisition, conversion, and expansion, reducing reliance on heavy sales tactics. If marketing, design, engineering, or other teams are not synchronized, the process loops back. This prevents siloed efforts that undermine initiatives. Designers need this alignment to ensure UX remains central. Also, it means funding experiments with clear ownership.</p><p>Ruben Dominguez wrote about The Rise of PLG, explaining that Dropbox mastered PLG by making file-sharing so effortless that users naturally invited others, with cross-functional teams iterating based on evidance and the right problem. Let’s check our business, If your PLG test fails, evidenced by a low viral coefficient, it may stem from misalignment. For example, researcher deliver insights and recommendations about, but marketing have different definition about the findings. Also, design may advocate for user testing, but engineering lacks the resources to implement changes.</p><p>Grammarly is another example: cross-functional alignment around a freemium UX model fueled viral growth without significant marketing spend. This can be initiated by the product, research, or growth department. This check is especially critical in startups, where limited budgets amplify the cost of misalignment.</p><p>The entire process is cyclical, governed by ‘Monitor, Measure, and Adapt, and back to monitor because sustainable growth is never a one-and-done effort.”</p><p>The entire process is cyclical, governed by ‘Monitor, Measure, and Adapt, and back to monitor because sustainable growth is never a one-and-done effort.”</p><h4><strong>As it’s never a one-and-done effort, what’s the truth about business growth?</strong></h4><p>Scaling a business and achieving exponential growth isn’t something impossible. Even though it’s difficult, it can be achieved when a business truly has the right strategy, the right execution, and the right focus.</p><p>It’s also important to understand what actually slows down business growth whether it’s the team, the system, the strategy, or even the mindset and inaccurate knowledge that shape every decision.</p><p>Oh, I know. It’s so easy to say things like, “Just check your business issues, solve them, and you’ll have sustainable growth!”</p><p>Sometimes you already have high-quality services, a brilliant system, and strategic marketing but the real issue is in our mindset or even our immaturity.</p><p>But the good news is: we can always learn, unlearn, and relearn anything.</p><h4><strong>Key reminders for designer growth focused</strong></h4><p>What I’ve learned from my own reflections and insights from product leaders:</p><p>1. Set clear goals; for the day, the week, the month, and the year.</p><p>2. Investigate deeply; look for real opportunities and make sure you’re solving the right problem.</p><p>3. Experiment and iterate; explore concepts with scalability potential or take calculated risks.</p><ul><li>Apply the right product design principles</li><li>Use the right UI patterns and UX laws that work</li><li>Read and interpret data clearly</li><li>Choose effective methods and define the right metrics</li></ul><p>4. Be aware of design responsibility; always consider the impact on both users and the business. Ethics matter.</p><p>Sustainable growth demands both strategic discipline and user-centered insight. Speed alone is not strength. Strength comes from clarity, reflection, and responsible execution.</p><p>My flowchart is not a final answer, but a guide a tool for reflection and decision-making. It exists to replace guesswork with a disciplined, evidence-driven system.</p><p>Now, ask yourself:</p><p>Where does your product currently stand?

Even when they insist they’re “designing for the user,” their own <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/230538.230561"">assumptions, values, and biases</a> inevitably slip into the work — usually without them noticing.</p><p>This is mainly due to what can be described as ethical misalignment — the gap between the user values designers think they’re honoring and the internal values that actually shape their decisions.</p><p>One of the main drivers of this misalignment is the industry’s habit of treating empathy as a stand-in for values — and sometimes as permission to slip personal priorities into the work.</p><p>Designers start assuming that a superficial understanding what someone experiences automatically tells them what should matter. It’s a comforting belief. It’s also wrong.</p><p>As <a href=""https://medium.com/thinking-design/why-i-dont-believe-in-empathic-design-c3dd0a956de9"">Don Norman has argued</a>, designers can’t actually have empathy in any literal sense — we can only observe behavior and imagine internal states. And imagination is unreliable.</p><p>The worst example of this is applying empathy before actual research occurs—projection masquerading as insight. We all do this, and it feels like basic human decency, but it can be dangerous to assume you know what another individual experiences or what their values actually are.</p><p>Empathy clarifies what a user experiences, but it does not tell you which experience should matter more. It doesn’t decide which trade-offs are acceptable, or how to weigh one user’s needs against another’s. Those choices come from values, not empathy.</p><p>Part of the problem is that traditional UX methods don’t actually measure user values. They measure usability, preferences, and observable behavior — but none of that tells you how a person morally prioritizes inclusion, autonomy, privacy, transparency, or well-being.</p><p>Because those deeper values remain invisible, designers end up filling the gaps with their own assumptions. That’s how teams convince themselves they’re “designing for the user” when the product is quietly reflecting the team’s values instead of the user’s.</p><h4><strong>How designer values sneak into the interface</strong></h4><p>It shouldn’t be surprising that everyone’s moral compass points in different directions. Flip between Fox and CNN for thirty seconds and you’ll see two completely different worldviews presented as fact.</p><p>Just as news outlets present competing realities, <a href=""https://monoskop.org/images/8/8c/Winner_Langdon_1980_Do_Artifacts_Have_Politics.pdf"">designers construct realities too</a> — every interface carries an implicit stance about what should matter. For example, when <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html#inclusion"">inclusion</a> rises to the top of a designer’s priorities, the user experience naturally becomes more nuanced. Accommodating a wider range of needs often softens the straightforward simplicity a majority audience might expect.</p><p>If <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html#wellbeing"">well-being</a> dominates, the pattern shifts again. Efficient or engaging features get softened or buried to reduce compulsion. That may feel responsible inside the team, but it frustrates users who value speed, momentum, or freedom.</p><p>And if <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html#transparency"">transparency</a> is the user’s priority, the need for disclosure might be ignored in the name of a clean, frictionless flow. Teams hide or compress information instead of presenting it fully. It satisfies an internal bias for elegance, but it leaves users with less clarity and less agency.</p><p>These types of choices rarely come directly from user research. They come from the ethics of the team itself — values that quietly harden into the architecture of the product.</p><h4>Why explicit ethical structures matter</h4><p>Ethical value tensions show up in nearly every product decision, yet the industry still struggles to confront them explicitly. <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/242485.242493"">Batya Friedman’s <em>Value Sensitive Design</em></a> (VSD), developed decades ago, was one of the first efforts to systematize this concept. It provided a structured way to examine which human values ought to guide technology — from the conceptual level to empirical research to technical implementation.</p><p>However, VSD has not gained widespread adoption in industry, largely because it leans toward an academic framework rather than a practical tool designers can apply to everyday product decisions. It’s also worth noting that any system attempting to prescribe a moral framework ignores the ethical dilemma <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem"">David Hume identified—you cannot derive an <em>ought</em> from an <em>is</em></a>.</p><p><a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html"">My framework</a> ties to avoid that trap. Instead of prescribing specific moral priorities, it exposes the gap between the values teams believe they’re honoring and the values users actually experience once those values are expressed in the interface. It’s not about telling designers which values to adopt — it’s about making the value tensions visible so trade-offs are conscious rather than accidental.</p><p>But before we can make ethical decisions, we need to understand the user’s values with precision. That’s why I’ve started to develop a simple Ethical Interface Design evaluation tool to sit alongside the Five Pillars of Ethical Interface Design framework.</p><p>The tool uses a <a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Uj4fi7SP9sUYVu2qbgeW0Tvy2hPAGeg9C1t00D57DrI/preview"">short 10-question survey</a>. For each of the <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html"">five pillars</a> (inclusion, autonomy, transparency, privacy, and well-being), users answer two prompts: one that captures their ethical preference — how important that pillar is to them — and another that evaluates how well the product currently delivers on that value, each rated from 1 to 5.</p><p>Together, the five pillars and the evaluation tool are not about prescribing which values you should hold. They expose the gap between what users actually prefer and the moral defaults the product is quietly imposing. The math is simple:</p><p><strong>User preference (1–5) minus Product score (1–5) = Gap.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>0</strong> → aligned</li><li><strong>Negative</strong> → you’re not meeting the value the user actually wants</li><li><strong>Positive</strong> → you’re pushing a value harder than the user prefers</li></ul><p>The key to making <a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Uj4fi7SP9sUYVu2qbgeW0Tvy2hPAGeg9C1t00D57DrI/preview"">this survey</a> work is to implement questions that expose ethical design tradeoffs. For example, if we look at the <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html#transparency"">pillar of transparency</a> (note: these questions are still being refined):</p><figure><img alt=""Survey with two questions: one about preference for speed vs. explanations, the other about clarity of product explanations. Each has five radio button options."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/645/1*pKf-yFEXGBVfbFlTUOTbMg.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot from Ethical Interface Design Evaluation</figcaption></figure><p>Across a group of users, the patterns show you exactly where your design values match the audience — and where your own worldview is leaking into the interface.</p><h4>The ethical pivot point</h4><p>Technology is no longer just entertainment, utilities, or conveniences.<br />It mediates attention, communication, decisions, even identity. That makes every value baked into an interface more consequential. We’re not arranging screens anymore. We’re shaping the logic of human–machine interaction — and by extension, shaping behavior and culture.</p><p>By understanding user values through <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/index.html"">ethical design</a> frameworks and tools we can help designers see where their instincts, assumptions, and moral defaults are quietly overriding the people they’re designing for. Not to eliminate value tension — that’s impossible — but to recognize it and make trade-offs consciously instead of unconsciously.</p><p>Ethical design isn’t about being virtuous. It’s about being honest with yourself about the values you’re imposing.</p><p>And in the end, it comes down to one unavoidable question: <strong>Are you designing for the user’s values — or your own?</strong></p><h4><em>References</em></h4><ul><li>Bias in computer systems: <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/230538.230561"">https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/230538.230561</a></li><li>Why I Don’t Believe in Empathic Design: <a href=""https://medium.com/thinking-design/why-i-dont-believe-in-empathic-design-c3dd0a956de9"">https://medium.com/thinking-design/why-i-dont-believe-in-empathic-design-c3dd0a956de9</a></li><li>Value-Sensitive Design: <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/242485.242493"">https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/242485.242493</a></li><li>Do Artifacts Have Politics?: <a href=""https://monoskop.org/images/8/8c/Winner_Langdon_1980_Do_Artifacts_Have_Politics.pdf"">https://monoskop.org/images/8/8c/Winner_Langdon_1980_Do_Artifacts_Have_Politics.pdf</a></li></ul><p><strong><em>Don’t miss out! </em></strong><a href=""https://micbuckcreative.medium.com/subscribe""><strong><em>Join my email list</em></strong></a><strong><em> and receive the latest content.</em></strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=11ee5268dff2"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/are-you-designing-for-the-users-values-or-your-own-11ee5268dff2"">Are you designing for the user’s values — or your own?</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>How the UX of AI chat can hijack our brains to compromise learning in schools and beyond</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*skDgxHxHE2BcAt9d2rAz6A.png"" /><figcaption>Illustrated by Charlie Gedeon</figcaption></figure><p>Ask any instructor what helps students learn, and it’s unlikely any of them will answer “a really big wall of text”. It’s incredible to me, as both a university instructor and a UX designer, that the army of people working at OpenAI are not imagining better tools for our students. I want to walk you through a design pattern in ChatGPT that, despite its good intentions, might be creating unintended hurdles for students.</p><p>I’m talking about “<a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07858v1"">verbosity compensation</a>”, which is an LLM’s tendency to provide overly wordy answers.</p><p>We’ve all seen it. You ask for help, and the AI provides a dense, multi-part response, that sounds like high-quality until you look closer. The challenge for learning specifically, is that managing the learner’s cognitive load is critical, and presenting information this way can be overwhelming. It’s a bit like asking how to boil an egg and getting the entire science of how water boils, the protein structure of an egg, and two egg salad recipes in response.</p><p>Let’s dive into ChatGPT’s “Study and Learn” mode with both our cognitive science and UX design lenses. I originally did this breakdown in a <a href=""https://youtu.be/QDCk3UWzg0U"">YouTube video</a>, and I’ve adapted it into an article here so it can be accessible to more folks. By the end of the article, I’ll explore potential interface ideas that could help with learning.</p><h3>All the steps at once</h3><p>To start, I used a simple, real-world prompt from a student: “I want to learn about Montreal’s role in the fur trade in shaping Canada’s history for an essay.”</p><p>You can see in the response below how heavy the answer is compared to the request. Yes, the student didn’t do a good job being specific, but as non-experts we should expect that they won’t always know.</p><figure><img alt=""A ChatGPT response with many bullets and follow-up recommendations"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*g46CoGaiV6Ziwd9D"" /></figure><p>When I broke down the response, I saw it was trying to do four things at once: ask the students’ grade, provide facts, suggest an essay structure, and ask if the student wanted to continue.</p><p>However not all of these are immediately appropriate when a student comes in with an uncertain request. To make this easier to follow, let’s give each part of the answer a name so we can analyze them more closely:</p><ol><li>Requirements gathering</li><li>Additional context</li><li>Structure recommendation</li><li>Task confirmation</li></ol><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*8zQeQqSagGlyZqvL"" /></figure><p>Now as UX designers, you know how important it is to structure steps to avoid overwhelming the users. It’s the reason why wizards and screen-by-screen flows are used in any task that requires multiple levels of user reflection, input, and confirmation.</p><p>Below I highlighted how each of these four steps has different expectations from the user, from needing user input to simply informing them.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YHUr9-2N_QeiwTKufdrq8Q.png"" /></figure><p>Let’s compare the ChatGPT response, with an Amazon checkout flow to highlight this gap. Looking at the screens below, notice how each step has a discrete action requested from the customer, and <em>just enough</em> information for the customer to make an informed decision.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*S51LfN5lx688hmPu"" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=""https://www.shaheermalik.com/blog/amazon-checkout-process-ux-design-case-study"">UX Case Amazon’s Checkout Process: UX Design Case Study 2024</a></figcaption></figure><p>Now imagine if the the entire Amazon checkout process was converted into a similar ChatGPT wall of text. It would be both confusing and would open a lot of room for error (or manipulation, depending on your worldview).</p><p>Customers would have to pay attention to things like credit card details, addresses, the order’s exact name, and the price, all in one shot. Would you feel comfortable answering the chatbot below to go ahead with the purchase?</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*I0er-5Un_8aYs-Aj"" /></figure><h3>Friction is necessary in learning</h3><p>In the Amazon example above, the biggest problem is that the friction from trying to read all that text, and it breaks several of the classic <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/#poster"">10 usability heuristics</a>. We can agree, quite easily, that this is not an optimal way to help users buy a product from Amazon.</p><p>However, the simplification of a checkout flow into steps is primarily to reduce errors. When it comes to learning, sometimes simplification can be a way to add <em>necessary friction</em> to improve learning outcomes.</p><p>Take a look at the <strong>Additional context</strong> that ChatGPT provides as a second step. It opens that bulleted list with “To get us started,” despite the the paragraph right before explicitly saying “Before we dig in.”</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sLET8jccMblJT61u_QVM-Q.png"" /></figure><p>This is troubling because the LLM almost had an opportunity to stop after <strong>Requirements gathering</strong> to allow the students time to provide more information and reflect on their needs. If it wasn’t for the incessant push to please users with easy answers, ChatGPT might have been a good tool for this kind of deeper introspection.</p><p>Instead, in providing all four of these steps in one answers, the LLM is inadvertently making it incredibly easy for the student to bypass the entire point of writing an essay. Finding relevant context and structuring an argument are the richest part of writing an assignment. If we care about the <em>content</em> of an essay and not just the <em>form</em>, the student needs to understand how to pick the right research and where to place it for a coherent point to be made.</p><p>Below you can see how ChatGPT first asks them for more details, automatically does research for them, provides a structure, and finally then asks them if they’d like to be walked through each step.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Dq4aIgz0BIC1-H7tqVqAtA.png"" /></figure><p>The unintended result is a path of least resistance that lets students bypass the very process of learning. And when a student is facing a deadline, that path is understandably tempting.</p><p>So I did what a busy student might do: I took the AI’s follow-up question as a helpful nudge. I ignored the first question about my grade and simply replied “yes” to the last one. ChatGPT, happy to oblige, did exactly what all instructors are dreading so much.</p><p>It began providing “guiding questions,” which aren’t bad at face value, but this is where ChatGPT’s verbosity compensation surprised me with a problem I didn’t expect. <strong>It often provides the answer within the question itself.</strong></p><p>For example, it asks, “What geographical features made Montreal ideal as a trading hub?” and then immediately adds, “A key point is the strategic location.”</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*5QdtMBw6t6nGUTqD"" /><figcaption>Red and blue show how questions one and two are answered only bullet points apart.</figcaption></figure><p>This essentially turns the task from a critical thinking prompt into a ‘fill-in-the-blanks’ exercise. The kind of activity that is less likely to build long-term understanding, essentially rendering such assignments into a charade of the original intention.</p><h3>Breaking the consistency needed for good UX</h3><p>The last point before we get into the solutions is how the very nature of LLMs break’s one of the golden rules for good UX: consistent behaviors to the same user actions.</p><p>This is a significant challenge for any educator trying to use this tool in a classroom. Both because students might independently get very different quality of support, and because any prompting tips provided by the teacher might not always work as intended.</p><p>I ran the exact same prompt three times and received three very different learning paths.</p><ul><li>One gave a full essay structure.</li><li>Another asked me to choose a focus (a more effective approach).</li><li>The third invited me to reflect on the topic myself (even better for learning).</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*eSEFPY0rjHS6WvqNVrRTJg.png"" /></figure><p>This inconsistency makes it difficult to rely on the tool for structured educational activities. It’s a tough design problem to solve, because it’s the foundation of how LLMs generate answers. But if we want to make tools where teachers and students can align on how to make them work, then we have much better chances of creating effective AI learning strategies for students. It’s crucial for creating a trustworthy learning environment.</p><p>So, what’s the opportunity? We can design for deeper learning.</p><h3>Designing with scaffolding and deeper learning</h3><p>As a designer, this is the part that gets me excited. We have a huge opportunity to build something even more effective. Instead of a single text dump, imagine an interface that uses scaffolding, guiding a student one intentional step at a time.</p><p>It could start by only asking for the student’s needs.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*DN6nn_D-C-K_0AEB"" /></figure><p>From there, it could introduce different essay types, explaining the pros and cons of each. This transforms the interaction into a series of small, manageable learning moments. More importantly, any context it provides would no longer about the content of the essay, but rather about the type. This helps students make <em>informed decisions</em> and develop a deeper understanding of why they are doing what they’re doing.</p><p>The goal isn’t to stop giving students powerful tools, but to design those tools to foster better thinking habits.</p><p>In an ideal world, I’d even go as far as suggesting more visual ways for thinking with interactive cards that let students look at their different options and even let them explore the different pathways.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*yVugAxUVmRftf3-X"" /></figure><p>Why limit the answers to just text inputs and outputs? We’re slowly seeing research emerge that this kind of dynamic UI creation is possible with <a href=""https://research.google/blog/generative-ui-a-rich-custom-visual-interactive-user-experience-for-any-prompt/"">Google’s generative UI</a>. But even without fancy technology, we can use simple things like text fields, drop-downs, buttons, and lists or carousels to make the information easier to interact with.</p><h3>Moving towards LLMs made for learning</h3><p>I want to be clear that my deep dive on this UX is not simply about making more interactive components to help with learning. There are foundational differences in the ways we should be training LLMs for a learning context.</p><p>The best inspiration I’ve found on methods to approach this are people exploring concepts of “productive resistance” like Advait Sarkar. In his <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/advait_sarkar_how_to_stop_ai_from_killing_your_critical_thinking"">TED Talk</a>, towards he says the following about his research lab’s philosophy.</p><blockquote>“We take the position that the ability to think well is essential for human agency and empowerment and flourishing.”</blockquote><p>Instead, what we have today are machines that prioritize increasing our time spent using them, rather than maximizing the learning that can happen with them. And yet, I am hopeful because we are so early in the life of AI interfaces and the technology that the best innovations are yet to come.</p><p>There are so many opportunities for us, as designers to actually make this experience of studying with an AI something that changes education rather than continues to bypass the most important steps. If you are working in an educational setting on a project with a lot of opportunities for learning, I’ll end with a place that you can start your own learn.</p><p>Designers can become a lot more potent if we understand the human brain at a level much deeper than most design schools invite us to. Most of the time, the world of UX thinks of psychology as a list of cognitive biases and attention spans. But the brain is so much more interesting and incredible, and learning in and of itself is so much more than a function relegated to students at a school.</p><p>Instead, I invite you to start thinking of your work as something that can shape human cognition at levels that are far more subtle than what we’re used to with traditional interfaces. While in this example I explored the harm to students, these same shortcuts can impact anyone who’s trying to learn, collaborate, or create with AI.</p><p>Learning is one of the most fundamental functions of our intelligence. Perhaps now is the time for all of us working in technology to understand its mysteries a little more deeply. As we keep learning, we may soon discover the best techniques to build tools that, as Sarkar said, enable human agency, empowerment, and flourishing.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e4e7facde91e"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/chatgpt-talks-too-much-and-its-ruining-learning-e4e7facde91e"">ChatGPT talks too much and it’s ruining learning</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11943891.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>R29 babes, we’ve made it to the final full <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">week of Sag Season</a>, and the energy shift is major. The highlight of this week is Mars leaving Sagittarius and entering Capricorn on December 15th, where it’s exalted, meaning this planet of action and ambition literally feels its best and performs at peak capacity in this earth sign. Mars will be in Capricorn for six weeks, and the collective vibe is shifting from “let’s explore everything!” to “let’s actually build something that lasts.”</p>



<p>This transit activates our discipline and ability to execute long-term goals with strategic precision instead of just spontaneous enthusiasm. Mars in Capricorn wants us focused, productive, and climbing mountains — both literal and metaphorical. But here’s the shadow: this energy can make us workaholics who forget that rest is productive too, or so focused on ending the year strong that we burn ourselves out trying to prove something.</p>



<p>The pressure to “finish 2025 perfectly” might feel intense, but remember: we’re in a 9 year in numerology, which is about spiritual completion and releasing what no longer serves us, not forcing traditional ambition. We’re also in the Year of the Snake in Chinese astrology, which is about shedding skin and dropping deadweight rather than aggressive forward momentum. The real work this week is grounded, consistent action toward goals that will ultimately make you feel lighter, not heavier.</p>



<p>Luckily, we still have <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">some Sagittarius fire</a> to balance all that Capricorn earth, because <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury just entered Sag</a> and the sun is wrapping up its tour here too. This blend of fire and earth is actually perfect: the Sagittarius energy keeps us optimistic, fun-seeking, and dreaming big while the Capricorn energy helps us figure out what practical steps we need to take to make those dreams real. You’re allowed to have fun and be productive, to set ambitious goals and take strategic action, to dream and build.</p>



<p>The key is not letting Mars in Capricorn convince you that grinding is the only path forward, or that your worth is measured by how much you accomplish before the year ends. The fire reminds us to enjoy the process, the earth reminds us to show up consistently — both are necessary. If you’re feeling torn between wanting to party through the holidays and feeling guilty that you’re not working hard enough, that’s this cosmic tension playing out. Give yourself permission to do both, intentionally.</p>



<p>And speaking of dreaming big: the New Moon in Sagittarius on December 19th is one of the most uplifting, hopeful lunar resets of the entire year. This is the final new moon of 2025, which means it’s your cosmic invitation to set intentions without playing small, to dream so big it feels uncomfortable, and to ask yourself: where could I be six months from now if I actually believed in my potential? Sagittarius energy is about expansion, optimism, and trusting that the universe wants you to win — this is not the new moon for realistic, practical goals (that’s what Mars in Capricorn is for). This is the new moon for vision-boarding your dream life and taking one bold action that proves you’re serious about it. The cosmic assignment for this week is clear: set intentions like your dreams are already real, take consistent action with Mars in Capricorn’s support, and trust your gut with Jupiter in Cancer’s wisdom.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, the final <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">week of Sag Season</a> is lighting up your expansion sector, and honestly, you’ve been living your best adventurous life. But the energy shifts dramatically on December 15th when Mars (your ruler) enters Capricorn and your career sector for the next six weeks. This is huge — Mars is exalted in Capricorn, meaning your ambition, drive, and professional focus are about to be unstoppable.</p>



<p>You’re entering your “build the empire” era where disciplined action toward career goals feels natural instead of forced. The next six weeks are perfect for promotions, launching businesses, or simply showing up professionally with the kind of consistency that creates lasting success. But here’s the shadow: Mars in Capricorn can make you such a workaholic that you forget fun exists, or so focused on climbing that you burn out before you reach the top. Remember that rest is strategic, not lazy, and your career success is more sustainable when you’re not sacrificing your entire life for it.</p>



<p>The New Moon in Sagittarius on December 19th lands in your expansion sector and it’s giving “dream so big it scares you” energy. This is the final new moon of 2025, so set intentions around travel, higher learning, entrepreneurship, or simply expanding your worldview in ways that feel impossible right now. Act as if you’re already living your dream life six months from now. This new moon is ruled by Jupiter in Cancer, which is activating your home sector. Maybe you’re expanding your idea of what home means, planning to move somewhere that supports your growth, or simply realizing that your foundation needs to evolve to hold your bigger dreams. Set intentions that honor both your need for adventure and your need for emotional security… you don’t have to choose between exploring the world and having roots.</p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, the final <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">week of Sag Season</a> is wrapping up in your transformation and shared resources sector, and you’ve been doing some deep work around intimacy and joint finances. On December 15th, Mars enters Capricorn and your expansion sector for six weeks, giving you the disciplined drive to finally take action on travel plans, educational pursuits, or philosophical growth you’ve been contemplating. Mars in Capricorn wants your expansion strategic and sustainable, not just spontaneous and scattered. You might feel motivated to book the trip, enroll in the course, or commit to beliefs that require consistent practice instead of just inspiration. The shadow is becoming so focused on planning your expansion that you forget to actually experience it, or turning growth into another checklist instead of an adventure.</p>



<p>The New Moon in Sagittarius on December 19th activates your transformation and shared resources sector with “benevolent billionaire” energy. This is your cosmic invitation to set intentions around the kind of wealth, intimacy, and power you want to embody in the next six months. What does abundance look like when you’re not just surviving but thriving? What partnerships (romantic or financial) would actually support your evolution? This week’s new moon is ruled by Jupiter in Cancer, which is lighting up your communication sector, so your words have extra manifestation power right now. This is one of the best times to speak your dream life into existence… literally say out loud what you’re calling in around money, shared resources, and transformation. You can manifest through honest conversations about what you need financially and emotionally. Trust that speaking your desires clearly is the first step toward materializing them.</p>

<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">final week of Sag Season</a> is lighting up your partnership sector with adventurous, honest relationship energy. But on December 15th, Mars enters Capricorn and your transformation sector for six weeks, shifting your focus to shadow work, shared resources, and intimacy that requires discipline. Mars in Capricorn wants you taking strategic action on healing, financial partnerships, or depth work you’ve been avoiding.</p>



<p>You might feel motivated to finally start therapy consistently, have serious conversations about joint finances, or simply show up to your shadow work with the same dedication you’d give to a career goal. But beware of becoming so intense about transformation that you forget to breathe… Let Mars help you commit to your depth work, but remember that healing has its own timeline and can’t be forced into productivity metrics.</p>



<p>The New Moon in Sagittarius on December 19th lands in your partnership sector and it’s asking you to dream big about relationships. This is the final new moon of 2025, so set intentions around the kind of partnerships (romantic or business) you want to call in over the next six months. What does collaboration look like when both people are free to be themselves? Who would you be in a relationship that actually celebrates your duality?This new moon is ruled by Jupiter in Cancer, which is activating your money and self-worth sector, creating a powerful connection between how you value yourself and the partnerships you attract. Maybe you’re realizing that the relationships you call in are directly related to how much you believe you deserve good things, or that financial abundance supports the kind of partnerships you actually want. Set intentions that honor both your need for connection and your individual worth.</p>

<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Sag Season is wrapping up</a> in your wellness and daily routine sector, and you’ve been experimenting with making self-care feel more adventurous. On December 15th, Mars in Capricorn enters your partnership sector for six weeks, giving you the drive to take serious action on relationships. Mars in Capricorn wants your connections disciplined, committed, and built on solid foundations; this is about showing up consistently in partnerships instead of just when it feels easy.</p>



<p>You might feel motivated to have difficult relationship conversations, set boundaries you’ve been avoiding, or simply put in the work to build partnerships that last. Avoid becoming so focused on fixing relationships that you lose the softness, or treating connections like another responsibility instead of something you actually enjoy. Let Mars help you build sustainable partnerships, but don’t sacrifice emotional intimacy for the appearance of stability.</p>



<p>The New Moon in Sag on December 19th activates your wellness sector and it’s asking you to dream big about your daily life. This is the final new moon of 2025, so set intentions around routines, health practices, and work habits that would make your everyday existence feel like your dream life. What would your mornings look like if you actually prioritized yourself? What work would you do if it felt like play? This new moon is ruled by Jupiter in your sign, which is amplifying your intuition, emotional expansion, and ability to trust yourself. Your gut feelings about wellness are extra accurate right now. Set intentions around self-care that’s sustainable and joyful, not just optimized. Trust your body’s wisdom about what it actually needs instead of what productivity culture says you should do.</p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, the final <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">week of Sag Season</a> lights up your creativity, romance, and pleasure sector with playful fire energy. But on December 15th, Mars enters Capricorn and your wellness sector for six weeks, shifting your focus to routines, health, and daily discipline. Mars in Capricorn wants you taking your self-care seriously… this is about building sustainable habits instead of just spontaneous wellness moments. You might feel motivated to commit to consistent workouts, create structured morning routines, or finally address health issues with strategic action instead of just positive thinking.</p>



<p>This transit’s shadow is becoming such a perfectionist about your routines that you lose the joy, or treating your body like another project that needs to be optimized for maximum performance. Let Mars help you build daily discipline, but remember that wellness is about feeling good, not just looking productive.</p>



<p>The New Moon in Sag on December 19th lands in your creativity, romance, and joy sector, and it’s basically the universe handing you permission to play without guilt. This is the final new moon of 2025, so set intentions around the kind of creative expression, romantic connections, and pleasure you want to experience in the next six months. What would you create if you knew it would be celebrated? Who would you love if you trusted they could handle your light? This new moon is ruled by Jupiter in Cancer, which is activating your solitude and healing sector, creating an interesting blend between public expression and private processing. Maybe you’re realizing that your best creative work comes from the healing you’re doing in private, or that romance feels safer when you’ve processed your own patterns first. Set intentions that honor both your need to shine and your need to do inner work… sometimes the most magnetic thing you can create is what emerges after you’ve healed. Trust your intuition about what actually brings you joy versus what just gets applause.</p>

<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">final week of Sag Season</a> activates your home sector with expansive energy. On December 15th, Mars enters Capricorn and your creativity sector for six weeks, giving you disciplined fire to actually finish creative projects instead of just planning them. Mars in Capricorn wants your self-expression strategic, your romantic life intentional, and your pleasure productive (yes, even fun gets organized with this transit). You might feel motivated to commit to creative routines, pursue romantic connections with clear intentions, or simply show up to your joy with consistency instead of waiting for inspiration. But beware of becoming so serious about fun that you forget to actually enjoy it, or turning creativity into another checklist where nothing feels good enough. Let Mars help you build sustainable creative practices, but remember that play is most powerful when it’s spontaneous, not scheduled.</p>



<p>The New Moon in Sag on December 19th activates your home sector, asking you to dream big about your foundation. This is the final new moon of 2025, so set intentions around the kind of living situation, family dynamics, and emotional roots you want to cultivate. What would home feel like if it supported your wildest dreams? What family relationships would look like if everyone spoke their truth? This new moon is ruled by Jupiter in Cancer, which is activating your friendship and community sector, creating a connection between your private foundation and your public social life. Maybe you’re realizing that chosen family is just as important as blood family, or that your home needs to be a place where you can host the community you’re building. Set intentions that honor both your need for domestic sanctuary and your desire for meaningful social connection. Trust your intuition about what foundation actually supports the person you’re becoming, not just what you think home should look like.</p>

<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Sag Season is</a> wrapping up in your communication sector, and you’ve been speaking your truth more boldly than usual. On December 15th, Mars enters Capricorn and your home sector for six weeks, giving you the drive to take action on domestic situations you’ve been contemplating. Mars in Capricorn wants your foundation solid, and your living situation functional. You might feel motivated to move, renovate, set boundaries with family, or simply create a home environment that supports your goals instead of just housing your stuff. The shadow of this transit is becoming so focused on fixing your foundation that you create more stress than stability, or treating home like another project that needs to be perfected. Let Mars help you build the sanctuary you need, but don’t sacrifice emotional comfort for the appearance of having it together.</p>



<p>The New Moon in Sag on December 19th lands in your communication sector, and it’s asking you to dream big about your voice. This is the final new moon of 2025, so set intentions around how you want to express yourself, what conversations you want to have, and what ideas you want to share over the next six months. What would you say if you knew people would actually listen? What would you write if you weren’t editing for everyone’s comfort? This new moon is ruled by Jupiter in Cancer, which is activating your career sector, creating a powerful connection between your personal expression and your professional reputation. Maybe you’re realizing that your authentic voice is actually your biggest career asset, or that the conversations you’ve been having privately are ready to become your public message. Set intentions that honor both your need to communicate honestly and your professional ambitions. Trust your intuition about what needs to be said, even if it disrupts the peace.</p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">final week of Sag Season</a> continues to active your money and self-worth sector with optimistic abundance energy. On December 15th, Mars, your planetary ruler, enters Capricorn and your communication sector for six weeks, giving your words serious power and your ideas strategic execution. Mars in Capricorn wants you to use your voice to build something that lasts. You might feel motivated to finally write that thing, have important professional conversations, or speak up in situations where you usually stay quiet. The shadow of this transit is becoming so intense in how you communicate that people feel attacked instead of informed, or treating every conversation like a strategic negotiation instead of genuine connection. Let Mars help you express yourself powerfully, but remember that impact doesn’t require force… sometimes clarity is enough.</p>



<p>The New Moon in Sag on December 19th activates your money sector and it’s giving “abundant AF” energy. This is the final new moon of 2025, so set intentions around the kind of financial reality you want to be living in six months. What would your bank account look like if you actually believed you deserved abundance? What income streams would exist if you valued yourself accurately? This new moon is ruled by Jupiter in Cancer, which is lighting up your expansion and belief sector, creating a powerful connection between what you believe is possible and what you can actually manifest financially. Maybe you’re realizing that your money story is directly connected to your worldview, or that abundance requires you to expand your beliefs about what you’re allowed to have. Set intentions that honor your actual worth, not the discounted version you offer when you’re scared of asking for too much. Trust your intuition about which financial moves will actually create the freedom you’re seeking… your gut knows the difference between strategy and scarcity.</p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, this is the final full week of your season and honestly, you’ve been living in main character energy. But on December 15th, Mars enters Capricorn and your money sector for six weeks, shifting your focus from exploration to building actual wealth. Mars in Capricorn wants your finances strategic, your income streams consistent, and your spending intentional. This transit is about creating financial stability that supports your adventures instead of just winging it with optimism. During Mars in Cap, you might feel motivated to budget seriously, pursue income opportunities with discipline, or simply get honest about the difference between abundance mindset and actual money management. The shadow is becoming so focused on making money that you forget why you wanted financial freedom in the first place, or grinding so hard for security that you lose the joy. Let Mars help you build sustainable wealth, but remember that money should fund your dreams, not replace them.</p>



<p>The New Moon in your sign on December 19th is the cosmic event of your year — this is the final new moon of 2025 and it’s asking you to dream the biggest dreams. Set intentions around who you want to be, where you want to go, and what you want to believe about your potential over the next six months. This is the time to vision your ideal life as if it’s already real and then take one bold step toward it. This new moon is ruled by Jupiter in Cancer, which is activating your transformation and shared resources sector, creating a connection between your personal expansion and your intimate partnerships. Maybe you’re realizing that your growth is supported by the right financial or emotional partnerships, or that transformation requires resources (both material and relational) you can’t build alone. Set intentions that honor your need for freedom and your need for depth… you can be independent and supported simultaneously.</p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the final <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">week of Sag Season</a> is activating your solitude and spirituality sector, asking you to process before you build. But on December 15th, Mars enters your sign for six weeks and you’re about to be unstoppable. Mars is exalted in Capricorn, meaning your drive, ambition, and ability to execute are at peak levels… this is your time to make power moves, start new projects, and show everyone what disciplined action looks like. You might feel more confident, energized, and ready to take up space in ways you usually downplay. The shadow of this transit is becoming such a workaholic that you forget you’re human, or pushing yourself so hard toward goals that you burn out before you succeed. Mars in your sign is a gift, but only if you remember that rest is part of the strategy, not a weakness.</p>



<p>The New Moon in Sag on December 19th lands in your solitude and closure sector, asking you to set intentions around your inner world. This is the final new moon of 2025, so what do you want to release, heal, or complete over the next six months? What would your spiritual practice look like if it felt nourishing instead of obligatory? This new moon is ruled by Jupiter in Cancer, which is activating your partnership sector, creating an interesting blend between private healing and relationship dynamics. Maybe you’re realizing that some closure needs to happen before you can show up fully in partnerships, or that the right connections support your inner work instead of disrupting it. Set intentions that honor both your need for solitude and your desire for genuine partnership… you don’t have to do all the healing alone, but some of it requires privacy.</p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">final week of Sag Season</a> is lighting up your friendship and community sector with expansive social energy. On December 15th, Mars enters Capricorn and your solitude sector for six weeks, shifting your focus from external community to internal healing. Mars in Capricorn wants you taking strategic action on your inner work: this is about committing to therapy, spiritual practices, or shadow work with the same discipline you’d give to any other goal. You might feel less social than usual and more called to process privately, which is actually necessary preparation for what’s coming. The shadow is isolating yourself so much that you forget community exists, or using solitude as avoidance instead of actual healing. Let Mars help you do the deep work in private, but don’t cut yourself off from support completely… sometimes healing requires both solitude and connection.</p>



<p>The New Moon in Sag on December 19th activates your friendship sector, and it’s asking you to dream big about community. This is the final new moon of 2025, so set intentions around the kind of friendships, collaborations, and social networks you want to be part of in six months. What would your people look like if they actually celebrated your weirdness? What community would you build if you trusted your vision was worth sharing? This new moon is ruled by Jupiter in Cancer, which is activating your wellness and daily routine sector, creating a connection between your social life and your self-care. Maybe you’re realizing that the right friendships actually support your health instead of draining it, or that community should feel nourishing, not obligatory. Set intentions that honor both your need for aligned social connection and your need for sustainable routines… you can have friends and boundaries simultaneously. Trust your intuition about which communities are actually yours versus which ones you’re maintaining out of habit.</p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">final week of Sag Season</a> activates your career sector with ambitious, expansive energy. On December 15th, Mars enters Capricorn and your friendship and community sector for six weeks, giving you the drive to take action on social connections and collaborative projects. Mars in Capricorn is about building networks that actually support your goals instead of just filling social time. You might feel motivated to step into leadership roles in your community, launch group projects with clear structure, or simply set boundaries with friends who aren’t matching your energy. The shadow of this transit is becoming so selective about community that you isolate yourself, or treating friendships like another networking opportunity instead of genuine connection. Let Mars help you build intentional community, but remember that real friendship requires vulnerability, not just strategy.</p>



<p>The New Moon in Sag on December 19th lands in your career sector, and it’s asking you to dream big about your professional life. This is the final new moon of 2025, so set intentions around the kind of success, recognition, and impact you want to create in the next six months. What would your career look like if it felt like your calling instead of just paying bills? What professional reputation would you have if you trusted your sensitivity was an asset? This new moon is ruled by Jupiter in Cancer, which is activating your creativity sector, creating a beautiful connection between your professional ambitions and your need for pleasure. Maybe you’re realizing that success is most sustainable when your work actually brings you joy, or that your career should reflect your creative gifts, not just your practical skills. Set intentions that honor both your ambition and your need for fulfillment… you don’t have to sacrifice happiness for success. Trust your intuition about which professional moves will actually feed your soul, not just your resume.</p>

With an elevated ceramic votive (which can be repurposed to house everything from makeup brushes to your favorite pens), these candles make an excellent gift for anyone who has a soft spot for the iconic mall brand’s three-wick candles. Frosted Cranberry is a grown-up version of your saccharine fruity scent, with its wintery notes of iced cranberries, blonde woods, apple, and tonka bean. <br /><br /><strong>Bath &amp; Body Works</strong> Frosted Cranberry 3-Wick Candle, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bathandbodyworks.com%2Fp%2Ffrosted-cranberry-3-wick-candle-028017579"">Bath &amp; Body Works</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1196"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11949745.png?auto=webp&amp;width=780&amp;height=1196&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=15:23"" width=""780"" /><figcaption><h2>Diptyque Tubereuse Candle</h2><br /><br />Every cool girl owns a Diptyque Tubereuse candle, and if you ask me, it’s the brand’s best — and most compliment-worthy — scent. It’s a creamy, heady floral that feels intoxicating in the best way. It’s also one of Diptyque’s most popular <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wedding-scentscaping-fragrance-trend"">wedding candles</a>, so if they’re getting married this year and thinking about scenting their wedding, they’re likely to fall in love with this one. <br /><br /><strong>Diptyque</strong> Tubereuse (Tuberose) Scented Candle, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Ftubereuse-tuberose-scented-candle%2F7422506"">Nordstrom</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""3000"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11949756.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2400&amp;height=3000&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=4:5"" width=""2400"" /><figcaption><h2>Trudon Nuit Enchantée Candle<br /></h2><br />If you really want to treat them, it has to be Trudon — the brand’s candles smell sensational even when they’re not lit. Nuit Enchantée Luna is like taking a breath of fresh air indoors: zingy bergamot, a sweet petal accord, creamy birchwood, and crunchy green lotus make up the notes that linger long after you’ve blown it out. Even better? The golden interior makes it feel like a piece of art — and it doesn’t fade as it burns. <br /><br /><strong>Cire Trudon</strong> Nuit Enchantee Luna Candle, 9.5 oz., $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neimanmarcus.com%2Fp%2Ftrudon-nuit-enchantee-luna-candle-9-5-oz-prod285290312%3FchildItemId%3DNMC6Q0S_%26msid%3D5424190%26position%3D9"">Neiman Marcus</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2500"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11949739.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2500&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=4:5"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><h2>Jo Loves Black Cashmeran &amp; Tonka Candle<br /></h2><br />They’ll burn through this faster than you can strike a match — it’s that good. The initial notes of bitter orange, zippy ginger, and warming cardamom give way to a glug of rich rum, vanilla-esque tonka bean, and creamy cedarwood. It fills my entire apartment with a scent that’s as cozy as a cashmere blanket — which makes sense, considering Jo Malone (of fragrance fame) is the mastermind behind the dreamy brand. <br /><br /><strong>Jo Loves</strong> Black Cashmeran &amp; Tonka, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.joloves.com%2Fproducts%2Fblack-cashmeran-tonka-a-home-candle"">Jo Loves</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

There’s a big difference between giving a gift and <em>really</em> giving a gift. We all know the feeling: something bought quickly just to check a box versus something chosen because it feels like the person it’s meant for. That intentional, personalized spark is exactly what creator <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/alexa.lumley/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Alexa Lumley</a> looks for — and exactly why <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Etsy</a> has become her go-to for discovering gifts that feel thoughtful, meaningful, and deeply personal.<br /> <br />For Lumley, shopping on Etsy isn’t a routine scroll — it’s a moment of connection. “What draws me to Etsy is the thrill of discovery,” she says. “I never feel like I’m just shopping; I feel like I’m getting a peek into someone’s passion — their craft, their story, their point of view.”<br /><br />That look into a maker’s world is what keeps her coming back. She’s drawn to pieces that feel thoughtful and personal — the kind of gift that feels like it was meant for someone in particular. “There’s something so satisfying about finding a piece you didn’t expect, but instantly know it’s the one.”<br /><br />When she’s in gifting mode, Lumley approaches Etsy with equal parts intuition and strategy. She always starts with her “favorite shops” list, but she loves letting the platform lead her somewhere unexpected. Her number-one tip? Use the “similar items on Etsy” section at the bottom of every listing. “Some of my absolute favorite pieces have come from scrolling there,” she says. “The less rigid I am, the better the finds.” It’s her secret to uncovering gifts she never could’ve searched for directly — especially the ones that end up meaning the most.<br /><br />That gift-driven mindset came through clearly when Lumley recently chose presents for her loved ones this holiday: a <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/listing/4325425131/beige-knit-sweater-women-chunky-ribbed?click_key=01f6a6ef50347b8ea87a031af0bf0051%3ALTb705faea2f8f2c1ee9dbd8d3158b1f7437eff5fe&amp;click_sum=4c05e97b&amp;ls=r&amp;ref=rlp-listing-grid-1&amp;external=1&amp;sr_prefetch=0&amp;pf_from=rlp&amp;sts=1&amp;content_source=01f6a6ef50347b8ea87a031af0bf0051%253ALTb705faea2f8f2c1ee9dbd8d3158b1f7437eff5fe"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">luxuriously cozy handmade sweater</a> for her mother, an incredible <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/listing/984862301/rustic-christmas-natural-linen?click_key=01f6a6ef50347b8ea87a031af0bf0051%3ALT6983f6892946084e2e7d8ffdca22b905748dfa2c&amp;click_sum=ce78f421&amp;ls=r&amp;ref=rlp-listing-grid-2&amp;external=1&amp;sr_prefetch=0&amp;pf_from=rlp&amp;pro=1&amp;frs=1&amp;sts=1&amp;content_source=01f6a6ef50347b8ea87a031af0bf0051%253ALT6983f6892946084e2e7d8ffdca22b905748dfa2c"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">linen tablecloth</a> for her sister, and a <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.etsy.com/listing/4352700156/handmade-ceramic-spoon-rest-fun-kitchen?click_key%3D01f6a6ef50347b8ea87a031af0bf0051%253ALTfde57492dfa563d42fa87dd6a8600a5da2259f78%26click_sum%3Db06969d3%26ls%3Dr%26ref%3Drlp-listing-grid-3%26external%3D1%26sr_prefetch%3D0%26pf_from%3Drlp%26frs%3D1%26content_source%3D01f6a6ef50347b8ea87a031af0bf0051%25253ALTfde57492dfa563d42fa87dd6a8600a5da2259f78&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1765387408517031&amp;usg=AOvVaw2BGAktedaR7EPU9k0YwrIS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">handmade ceramic spoon rest</a> painted with 'Mediocre Chef'— a cheeky little nod that instantly reminded her of her best friend. ""It was exactly her sense of humor,"" she says. They’re the kinds of gifts that make people say, <em>Wait, where did you find this?</em> — which, for Lumley, is the whole point.<br /><br />Her gifting philosophy mirrors her approach to personal style. “I’m a very visual person,” she explains. Thoughtful photography and cohesive styling help her understand a maker’s intention — something she values deeply when choosing pieces for others. And when she’s unsure, she returns to the mood boards she builds for herself. “If a piece fits the overall vibe, I know I’ll love it long-term. If it doesn’t, it’s usually a reminder that I’m looking at an impulse buy.”<br /><br />Still, her favorite finds are always the unexpected ones, like a recent discovery — a <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/listing/1657422074/baguette-candle-4-wick-beeswax-bread?click_key=c6c50d4b0a1eea25c6109b17be9ec371%3ALT9131757c33e1800154f1f2ed718845f902a7836d&amp;click_sum=a1a8311c&amp;ls=r&amp;ref=rlp-listing-grid-25&amp;external=1&amp;sr_prefetch=0&amp;pf_from=rlp&amp;frs=1&amp;sts=1&amp;content_source=c6c50d4b0a1eea25c6109b17be9ec371%253ALT9131757c33e1800154f1f2ed718845f902a7836d"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">baguette candle</a> so realistic it made her think of a friend who loves to host dinner parties as much as she loves good food.<br /><br />This Etsy magic is what keeps Lumley returning to the platform for gifting again and again: it bridges the gap between wanting to give something nice and wanting to give something thoughtful. It’s where craft becomes connection and discoverability is mixed with soul. “When a piece feels so specific to someone you love, it makes the discovery feel even more special.”<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSAeag3kdaU/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA=="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Watch her video</a> to explore the personalized Etsy gifts she chose for the people she loves.<figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948354.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><h2>Handmade Ceramic Spoon Rest</h2><br />For the home cook whose kitchen tells a story—splattered sauces, big laughs, and all.

<p>Every January, I set big intentions: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tal-hydration-water-bottle-review"">drink twice as much water</a>, hit <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/03/11866324/the-girls-spot-womens-only-gym-trans-women-ban-backlash"">the gym</a>, and see my friends more. Without fail, life usually gets in the way, and most fizzle out, but one rule I always stick to is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/skincare-products-you-dont-need"">taking good care of my skin</a>. </p>



<p>As a beauty director, I know too many dermatologists <em>not</em> to. (Yes, I’ve been scolded for not removing my makeup properly — it’s a little embarrassing.) But making — and keeping — skincare resolutions doesn’t have to feel like a chore. Often, even small changes can build the foundation for skin you’re happy with.</p>



<p>Ahead, I asked a top dermatologist for their practical skincare resolutions for 2026. Believe me — these are goals you’ll actually want to follow in January and beyond.</p>

<p>There’s no shortage of apps and websites that screen skincare ingredients and label them “safe” or “unsafe” for your skin — but dermatologist <a href=""https://drophelia.com/?srsltid=AfmBOor1SZ0zAioqHnSNhEuCEpxXtxjuHiSp-ltwTen9UrhqlRGBraRo"">Dr. Ophelia Veraitch</a> isn’t convinced. “I haven’t found the apps to help screen ingredients very accurate,” says Dr. Veraitch. </p>



<p>Instead, she recommends that patients prone to unexplained irritation or sensitivity cross-check their products against an allergy list. The <a href=""https://dermnetnz.org/topics/baseline-series-of-patch-test-allergens"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">North American Baseline Series</a> — often used by dermatologists — is a standard list of allergens most commonly known to cause contact dermatitis, meaning skin irritation like redness or dry, cracked skin caused by direct contact with an allergen. If your skin doesn’t react to your skincare or cosmetics, there’s generally little need to cross-check.</p>



<h2>Supercharge sunscreen with these key ingredients</h2>



<p>If you’re an R29 regular, this might sound obvious: “<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-sunscreen-spf-oily-skin"">Daily, year-round sunscreen</a> is the single most impactful habit for preventing premature aging and reducing the risk of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mole-mapping-experience-melanoma"">skin cancers</a>,” says Dr. Veraitch, who recommends a high-factor (SPF 30–50), <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wearing-sunscreen-spf-daily-affordable"">broad-spectrum facial sunscreen</a>. But if you really want to maximize its protective benefits, consider layering a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-vitamin-c-serum"">vitamin C</a> or vitamin E serum underneath. “Both ingredients help neutralize free-radical damage,” says Dr. Veraitch, basically things like pollution and UV rays. “They also support collagen,” she adds, which keeps skin supple.</p>



<p>Opt for a gentle vitamin C serum like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fmulti-antioxidant-radiance-serum-with-vitamin-c-P516231%3F"">The Ordinary’s Multi-Antioxidant Radiance Serum with Vitamin C and Ginseng</a>, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2F12-pure-vitamin-c-anti-aging-face-serum-pimprod2012322%3Fsku%3D2556946"">La Roche-Posay 12% Pure Vitamin C Anti-Aging Face Serum</a>. If you tend to have dry, easily irritated skin, vitamin E is naturally more moisturizing and can help protect your skin barrier — the outermost layer that keeps good stuff in (like moisture) and bad stuff out (like bacteria). Try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fsuper-serum-5-in-1-renewing-face-serum-pimprod2041031%3Fsku%3D2615445"">Olay Super Serum 5-in-1 Renewing Face Serum</a>.</p>





<h2>Try tranexamic acid for hyperpigmentation</h2>



<p>From vitamin C to glycolic acid, there are a handful of ingredients dermatologists recommend <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/07/11453847/hyperpigmentation-scale-dark-skin-esthetician-advice"">for hyperpigmentation</a>, often caused by acne, superficial burns, or too much sun exposure. But according to Dr. Veraitch, there’s nothing quite like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/10/11131505/melasma-treatments-dermatologist-shereene-idriss"">tranexamic acid</a>.</p>



<p>“Tranexamic acid is one of the most effective and underutilized ingredients for treating pigmentation,” she says. “What’s more, it helps calm inflammation and targets pathways involved in melasma [a skin condition that causes gray or brown patches], post-inflammatory marks, and uneven skin tone.”</p>



<p>Dr. Veraitch adds that she doesn’t like to chase buzzy new ingredients. Instead, she prefers to see solid data and real-world experience before recommending something to her patients — and there’s <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4235096/"">plenty of research</a> ruling in tranexamic acid’s favor for treating pigmentation.</p>

There’s also <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Ftranexamic-topical-acid-5-pimprod2045655%3Fsku%3D2627359"">Naturium’s Tranexamic Topical Acid 5%</a>, formulated with tranexamic acid, niacinamide, and kojic acid to even out skin tone, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Finnbeauty-project-retinol-remix-1-retinol-treatment-with-peptide-tranexamic-acid-P483127%3F"">INNBeauty Project Retinol Remix 1% Retinol Treatment</a>, with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/rhode-peptide-eye-prep-review"">skin-strengthening peptides</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"">cell-rejuvenating retinol</a>.</p>





<h2>Make mindful drinking part of your skincare goals</h2>



<p>“Alcohol can really exacerbate inflammatory skin conditions such as acne <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sex-trigger-rosacea-flare-up"">and rosacea</a>,” says Dr. Veraitch, who believes January is the perfect time to consider “cutting back and rebalancing the skin” after the festive season. In fact, prioritizing overall wellbeing throughout the year — whether managing stress, exercising more, or seeking help for sleeplessness — is always her top tip. “General health plays a huge role in skin and hair quality,” she emphasizes.</p>



<h2>Where you spray perfume makes all the difference</h2>



<p>If you have sensitive or reactive skin, Dr. Veraitch recommends rethinking where you spray your perfumes and body mists. “Spraying perfume directly onto the skin can trigger contact allergies and make people sensitive to many fragranced skincare products,” says Dr. Veraitch, who has seen this firsthand in her clinic. She adds that perfume is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/perfume-fragrance-hormonal-effects"">absolutely fine and safe to use</a>, but those with sensitivities may do better applying it to clothing rather than directly onto their skin. Fragrance tends to last a lot longer on clothes, anyway. </p>



<h2>Targeted skincare beats blanket injectables</h2>



<p>Dr. Veraitch says many patients book injectables <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/injectable-lip-balm-filler"">like filler</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/preventative-botox-wrinkles-scam-myth"">Botox</a> without first making sure their skin is at its healthiest — think a strong <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-is-skin-barrier-damage-fix"">skin barrier,</a> with minimal irritation. Of course, R29 is a judgment-free zone when it comes to treatments, but if you <em>are</em> considering injectables, Dr. Veraitch advises seeing a dermatologist for a targeted treatment plan first: “Clear, healthy skin means you’re not constantly ‘chasing’ signs of aging with fillers,” she says. A dermatologist, facialist, or esthetician can help you build a skincare plan that suits your budget.</p>



<h2>Consider making laser part of your skincare plan</h2>



<p>If your skincare budget extends to treatments in 2026, Dr. Veraitch can’t speak more highly of Fraxel Dual, a non-ablative laser she says improves skin texture, pigmentation, and overall radiance in a long-lasting way. “It’s one of the most effective ways I’ve seen to ‘reset’ the skin,” says Dr. Veraitch, who regularly recommends the treatment to her patients.</p>



<p>And it’s not just cosmetic. “Recent data from Harvard dermatologists has shown that patients who get Fraxel Dual once a year have a 50% <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36728065/"">reduced risk of developing non-melanoma</a> skin cancers,” she adds. That said, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-uv-filters-spf-45-sunscreen"">wearing sunscreen</a> and limiting your time in the sun is just as effective — and remains a top dermatologist recommendation. There’s no need to spend a small fortune, either. “People often believe that the more expensive the product, the better the results — but that’s rarely true,” says Dr. Veraitch. “Using the right and good quality actives, plus a decent SPF for your skin, matters far more than price.”</p>

<p>After <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">months of planetary retrogrades</a>, we are finally regaining our energy. For the first time since the start of 2024, Mars is shining boldly in Capricorn, giving us the enthusiasm to move forward. This is the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/december-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">cosmic glow-up</a> we’ve been waiting for! Now, we can move into the new year with a more refined and ardent mindset. So, set your calendar for December 15th to feel the energetic shift. </p>



<p>Mars in Capricorn is a powerful placement for the action planet. Capricorn is a cardinal sign that likes to get things done and won’t stop until it achieves its goal. When Mars and Capricorn collide, it utilizes strategy and ambition to achieve its goals. During this transit, we focus on the long-term agenda rather than short-term plans, ensuring that our goals come to fruition through planning and discipline. We can succeed at whatever we put our mind to, as long as our visions are well thought out and leave no room for error.</p>



<p>Surely, you must be aware that Mars in Capricorn brings out our <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/women-high-libido"">highest sex drives</a>? However, we aren’t ones to look for frills or fancy lovemaking; instead, we often prefer a straightforward approach to hooking up (Mars in Capricorn works and plays hard at the office and in the bedroom). But we tend to lean into the simple pleasures of life. Capricorn is an earth sign that likes decadence just as much as its cohorts; the sea goat doesn’t kiss and tell and keeps it low-key. </p>



<p>It’s important to note that Mars in Capricorn can take matters to the extreme after being pushed to the edge, which doesn’t take much. The slightest criticism can stir the pot. However, this placement doesn’t necessarily want to engage in arguments — a chill lifestyle is essential. Once they reach a feverish pitch, they will be relentless in proving their points and won’t stop until the other person gives up. Basically, Mars in Capricorn isn’t about to wave a white flag in the air; they’ll keep it going until an authentic apology is given.</p>



<p>We may be a little pushy and want to expedite matters because we want them to happen at top speed. It’s great to be excited about relationships, as we want to fulfill our aspirations in every area of our lives; however, we must respect other people’s boundaries. Although Mars in Capricorn is very compliant to their needs, this placement can be a little aggressive and force us to ignore limits that are set in partnerships.</p>



<p>All in all, Mars in Capricorn is a glorious time to expand our horizons, as long as we don’t hold back. By aligning with the cosmic forces at play, we can flourish and bring our dreams to life. Most importantly, take this time as an opportunity to prioritize self-care and do something great for yourself. Give yourself TLC!</p>
