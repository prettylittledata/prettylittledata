Pursuing a façade-less architecture, the design was started with the question, what if the flexibility of community activities, art exhibitions, and garden spaces acted as an unlimited permutation of functional façade that defined the space and shaped the identity of the architecture itself? The design was to demonstrate a selfless approach to creating many sheltered indoor spaces hidden within a simple multi-leveled garden. Spaces that were created became a sequential space and were not an initial space.</p>",

<p>The fragility—and temporal beauty—of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/645768/light-matters-a-flash-back-to-the-glittering-age-of-las-vegas-at-the-neon-museum?ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=search_result_articles"">neon </a>has captivated audiences since the early 1900s. First shown commercially by French engineer Georges Claude at the 1910 Paris Motor Show, neon spread rapidly, achieving <a href=""https://northamericansigns.com/golden-age-neon/?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com"" target=""_blank"">broad popularity in the United States from the 1920s</a> through the 1950s. Mid-century America saw it everywhere: from the casinos of the Las Vegas Strip to roadside motor inns along Route 66 and the spectacle of Times Square. By the latter half of the century, however, many signs were scrapped or left to decay, and numerous municipalities restricted neon as visually garish or power-hungry—<a href=""https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/why-neon-lights-are-glowing-again-across-the-us?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com"" target=""_blank"">despite the technology's comparatively modest energy use</a>. In the U.S., renewed interest in neon arguably didn't meaningfully return until the early 2000s.</p>",

<p>The Zayed National Museum has opened its doors to the public. Located at the heart of the Saadiyat Cultural District in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/abu-dhabi"">Abu Dhabi</a>, the <strong>new national museum of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) traces the history of the Emirates</strong>, from the earliest evidence of human habitation to the civilisations that shaped its culture and identity, rooted in the values of the UAE's Founding Father, the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. The building's form addresses the challenge of sustaining life in a desert environment and the strong cultural traditions of the UAE.</p>",

Photo by <a href=""https://unsplash.com/@elijahbcrouch?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Elijah Crouch</a></figcaption></figure><p>It would be something of an understatement to say AI has impacted the world of UX design.</p><p>But how, <em>exactly</em>, has it affected UX and its practitioners?</p><p>The answer isn’t straightforward, as every new AI development is accompanied by social media hype, hot takes and flexing, as designers try to prove to the world — and possibly themselves — that <em>they</em> know what the latest bleeding-edge model means for design.</p><p>That’s a lot of noise. How can we cut through the static to see the real picture?</p><p>Enter academia.</p><p>Over the past five years, numerous academic journal papers have been published about AI and UX design. While the wheels of academia turn slowly, we get a significant trade-off for its glacial pace: objectivity and methodical rigour.</p><p>In other words: a healthy dose of perspective.</p><p>The goal of this article is to summarise academic findings relating to four questions:</p><ol><li>Where is AI being used in the UX design process?</li><li>What are the advantages and drawbacks of using AI in UX design?</li><li>How do UX design practitioners feel about using AI?</li><li>What are the takeaways for future use of AI in UX design?</li></ol><p>The key sources for this article are two <a href=""https://library.leeds.ac.uk/info/1404/literature-searching/15/systematic-reviews"">systematic reviews</a> from 2025: one <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/ahci/3869207"">published in <em>Advances of Human-Computer Interaction</em></a>, and another <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04469"">available on the open-access scholarly platform ArXiv</a>. In total, this article summarises findings from 17 academic sources which are referenced at the end. Typically, these studies base their findings on surveys, interviews, focus groups and other research methods to collect insights from UX and HCI practitioners.</p><p>So forget everything you’ve read from LinkedIn hype merchants, ‘thought leaders’ or doom-mongers.</p><p>Let’s summarise what the science says.</p><h3>1. Where AI is used in the design process</h3><p>The highest usage of AI in UX design is in the <strong>testing</strong> phase, suggests <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/ahci/3869207"">one of our 2025 systematic reviews</a>. According to this paper, 58% of studied AI usage in UX is in either the testing or discovery stage. This maybe shouldn’t be surprising, considering generative AI for visual ideation and UI prototyping has lagged behind text generation.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram showing number of studies looking at AI usage in UX design"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*68bsGgzn3STeRh1mRsJtEA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>AI usage in the UX design process (Luo, 2025)</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s what AI’s commonly being used for in each design stage:</p><h4>Discovery</h4><ul><li>Identifying design problems</li><li>Understanding user needs and behaviours</li><li>Creating user personas</li></ul><h4>Ideation</h4><ul><li>Co-creating solution concepts</li><li>Exploring design alternatives</li><li>Predicting product values</li></ul><h4>Prototyping</h4><ul><li>Generating UI designs</li><li>Converting sketches to prototypes</li><li>Checking for GUI guideline violations</li></ul><h4>Testing</h4><ul><li>Predicting user experience</li><li>Identifying usability issues (e.g. heuristic evaluations)</li><li>Planning and analysing user testing</li></ul><p>In terms of what AI tools UX practitioners are using, here’s a breakdown which is both informative but already slightly out of date:</p><figure><img alt=""Graph showing AI usage in UX design with ChatGPT leading the way"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*prI1D36s13QeOnnQG-taug.png"" /><figcaption>Frequency of AI models used across UI/UX design studies (Ahmed and Imran, 2025)</figcaption></figure><h4>Summary</h4><p>UX practitioners are clearly making use of AI across the design process, with ChatGPT being the most popular tool.</p><p>However, while ideation and prototyping with AI gains a lot of attention, it’s the <em>testing</em> phase where the most studies have examined utilising AI — and it’s also significantly studied in the discovery phase. This disparity may even out as AI continues to improve at generating UI designs.</p><h3>2. Advantages and drawbacks of using AI in UX design</h3><p>I’ve grouped these insights from academic papers into broad themes. You can see that for every benefit of using AI in the UX design process, there are risks and pitfalls to avoid.</p><h4>Speed, cost and quality</h4><p><strong>Advantages: </strong>AI can speed up UX design in numerous ways, from research and ideation to prototyping and testing. For example, it can <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3658619.3658628"">accelerate concept iteration</a> in the early stages of the design process compared to traditional UX methods. This has obvious implications in terms of <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10115412"">reducing delivery timeframes and project costs</a>.</p><figure><img alt=""Seahorse design concept generated by the AI tool Midjourney"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AJ0q0Q62hV8bx5KL984ECQ.png"" /><figcaption>Concept co-creation with Midjourney (Maceli, Smith and Bhakta, 2024)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Drawbacks:</strong> AI generated design ideas can be <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642114"">homogeneous, generic and lacking in consistency</a>, meaning the time and cost of human input must be considered to ensure the final designs are sufficiently distinct and cohesive. (That is, if we care about designing better — or simply good — solutions, and not just <em>faster </em>solutions.)</p><h4>Efficiency versus innovation</h4><p><strong>Advantages: </strong>The use of AI can <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642114"">relieve UX designers from mundane and tedious tasks</a>, allowing them to concentrate on activities that require more critical thinking and emotional engagement. Essentially, there are huge opportunities to offload a lot of grunt work to AI systems. But designers need to be careful about this, because…</p><p><strong>Drawbacks: </strong>Over-reliance on AI designs could lead to <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3409120.3410638"">fixation on minor optimisations rather than out-of-the-box thinking</a>. This means designers need to find a balance between efficiency and innovation — by avoiding dependence on AI where human creativity and agency would add value leading to better solutions.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram showing what AI can and cannot do in the design process"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kAEQ1IPqJKQJX2eDBMU65g.png"" /><figcaption>What AI can and can’t do (Li et al., 2024)</figcaption></figure><h4>Skills and development</h4><p><strong>Advantages: </strong>There’s clear <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3404983.3405506"">potential for AI to lower the skill threshold required for designers</a> in UX. Which makes sense, as prompting is easier to learn than all the features and functionality of Figma. This change allows a wider range of people to contribute design ideas without traditional visual design tool skills.</p><figure><img alt=""Series of sketched, designed and generated UI screens"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1007/1*lKKQRvtXf8KGR-nH2anUPQ.png"" /><figcaption>Sketched input versus manual design and generated AI output (Buschek, Anlauff and Lachner, 2020)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Drawbacks: </strong>Over-dependence on generative AI tools might impede development for UX novices, as <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3615335.3623035"">repetitive tasks help cultivate UX design skills and judgement</a>. Junior designers might be at higher risk of negative cognitive effects from AI generally, as <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/15/1/6"">young people exhibit higher dependence on AI tools and lower critical thinking skills</a>.</p><h4>Summary</h4><p>It’s a mixed bag, basically. For all the opportunities that AI brings to UX design, there are plenty of challenges and traps practitioners can fall into. Some of these issues will be solved by technology improving, but others require skilful and mindful integration of AI into UX design processes.</p><figure><img alt=""Bar chart showing challenges using AI in UX design with hallucinations at the top"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kmOGmOvjO0jbcZVAOwLvGQ.png"" /><figcaption>AI challenges in UX design (Ahmed and Imran, 2025)</figcaption></figure><h3>3. How UX practitioners feel about using AI</h3><p>These are reflections from UX professionals about their experiences of using AI in the design process. I’ve categorised them as either positive or negative sentiments, adding a few comments of my own (in parentheses).</p><h4>Positives</h4><ul><li>Using AI in the design process can make <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/ahci/3869207"">UX practitioners feel both more effective and efficient</a>. (I hesitate to use the phrase ‘super-powered’, as The Incredibles tells us: when everyone’s super, no-one is.)</li><li>Designing with AI helps develop skills in prompting, which is <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04469"">emerging as a core design skill</a>. (It’s surely only a matter of time before we start seeing <em>Prompting is Designing</em> UX books hitting the shelves.)</li><li>Generating design variants with <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3643834.3661624"">AI avoids the ‘blank page’ problem</a>, where UX designers struggle to get started. (Even for professionals, the blank canvas of a design file can sometimes be intimidating.)</li><li>Collaboration with AI can<em> </em>feel like a <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/ahci/3869207"">complementary partnership between human cognition and AI technology</a>. (Similar to a senior designer guiding a junior designer.)</li><li>Using <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3643834.3660703"">AI helps facilitate collaboration with stakeholders</a> by streamlining idea sharing and exploration. (Basically, AI can help make the sometimes arcane practice of UX clearer and more accessible to stakeholders.)</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Four photos from a design focus group on AI, showing people with colourful sticky notes"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1012/1*zmWAQEFMce3Ca1vsl6AkyQ.png"" /><figcaption>Focus group on AI and UX collaboration (Wang et al., 2024)</figcaption></figure><h4>Negatives</h4><ul><li>Designing with AI can also feel like being a <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2024.1404647/full"">client commissioning a contractor rather than <em>designing</em></a>. (In other words: designers can feel like the AI is doing the fun, creative bits while they write the brief.)</li><li>When UX designers feel like they’ve outsourced creative tasks, it can lead to <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3491101.3503564"">diminished sense of ownership over the results</a>. (How invested can you be if you didn’t even draw a single rectangle?)</li><li>Creating an effective prompt can be a <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04469"">time-intensive process with a high cognitive burden</a>. (Although in future this could be mitigated by refining prompting templates and support resources.)</li></ul><h4>Summary</h4><p>The positives outweigh the negatives, but there are clear issues to resolve. This includes UX practitioners’ sense of identity as designers, as well as the time and mental effort required to craft effective prompts, generate outputs and carry out continual refinements.</p><h3>4. Takeaways for future use of AI in UX design</h3><p>I’ve tried to categorise these suggestions into meaningful themes. They typically crop up in the discussion and conclusion sections of academic papers.</p><h4>AI increases efficiency, but people still matter</h4><p>The biggest impact of AI in UX design is the <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/ahci/3869207"">increased efficiency across the design process</a>. However, AI cannot replace human interpersonal communication, collaboration, creativity or originality; therefore it’s important to <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642114"">balance pursuing efficiency while preserving the human-centred nature of UX design</a>.</p><h4>Humans need to remain in the loop</h4><p>UX designers should adopt a <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/discover/human-in-the-loop"">human-in-the-loop</a> approach to validate AI output, improve model performance and <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10034833"">avoid overreliance on automated systems</a>. However, designers should be mindful that <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3512943"">AI tools could potentially <em>reinforce</em> their existing biases</a> instead of challenging them. This is an area where critical thinking skills are absolutely, well, critical.</p><figure><img alt=""Word cloud with prompt engineering, real-time feedback and modular design featuring prominently"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/980/1*RurZhxCwxTpuUlk--9Yg1w.png"" /><figcaption>Word cloud of best practices for AI and UI/UX design (Ahmed and Imran, 2025)</figcaption></figure><h4>AI policies are needed for ethical practice</h4><p>Adoption of AI <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04469"">must be ethical and inclusive as well as efficient</a>. To alleviate concerns about ethics, data privacy, ownership, and accountability, organisations should <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3643834.3660720"">set up and communicate policies on AI usage</a>. Too many UX practitioners are still driving ahead, often alone, without clear internal strategies or policies for generative AI.</p><h4>UX designers need specific AI training</h4><p>To successfully integrate AI into design team processes and workflows, UX practitioners would <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10382802"">benefit from training to develop proficiency</a> in crafting and refining prompts, assessing and criticising AI-generated output, and accounting for AI intricacies and limitations. There’s a world of difference between dabbling with AI in design and using it as effectively as possible.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>So what’s the story? How <em>is</em> AI impacting UX design?</p><p>Well, it’s clear from the academic studies that traditional design methods are being innovated: UX practitioners are harnessing AI, leading to efficiencies and lowering costs for organisations in the process. The benefits are undeniable. UX design has fundamentally changed in the past 2–3 years, and it’s probably career suicide to deny that.</p><p>In fact, more UX designers might need to let go of conventional design stages and activities to <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/ahci/3869207"">allow for even <em>more</em> innovative processes empowered by AI</a>. For example, strictly adhering to established workflows and handover processes ignores the potential to go from concept to functional, testable solution rapidly with AI.</p><p>However, there are potential drawbacks if AI usage in UX design is over-relied on, and used mindlessly. Without sufficient critical thinking, we can easily end up with generic, biased designs that don’t actually solve user problems. In some cases, we might even spend too much time on prompting and vibing with AI when we could have simply sketched or prototyped something ourselves — creating more sense of ownership in the process.</p><p>Many of these findings might feel obvious to a lot of people. But of course the point of rigorous research is often to validate what you <em>think </em>you already know. This deep dive into academia shows us what we really <em>do </em>know, for sure.

<h4>Is design standing in the way of me showing up in community?</h4><figure><img alt=""A screenshot from TheNapMinistry Threads that says ““Hey, here to say you don’t have to start a project, club, new invention or initiative as we focus on community, connection and the analog world. You can just hang out with your friends, say hello to your neighbor and spend more time offline.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*C7FlVluvY4cAD69gy3ui3g.jpeg"" /><figcaption>A screenshot from <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPkNek0ke20/?hl=en"">https://www.instagram.com/p/DPkNek0ke20/?hl=en</a></figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPkNek0ke20/?hl=en"">I recently saw a post</a> from The Nap Ministry that said:</p><blockquote><em>“Hey, here to say you don’t have to start a project, club, new invention or initiative as we focus on community, connection and the analog world. You can just hang out with your friends, say hello to your neighbor and spend more time offline.”</em></blockquote><p>The post struck a chord in me. I’m often the first to create a themed party or a logo for an event. I love a well-designed gathering with intentional activities and plans. But reading the post, it also made me think about all the times where I got stuck in the planning phase and never got to actually “doing” the thing I was planning in detail because I ran out of time or energy.</p><p>As much as curated spaces, planned interactions, crafted products, and intentional takeaways can enhance experiences and deepen connection, could too much design also stand in the way of us building and engaging in real communities?</p><p>What really happens when we overly design our communities?</p><h3>When we overly design, planning halts action.</h3><p>Planning the perfect event or building the perfect structure can feel productive, but it often becomes a stall. We wait until the idea is polished, until the branding feels right, until the schedule lines up, until we can justify gathering people around something that looks “enough.”</p><p>We often say that design is about iteration, but in practice, the planning and polishing can take over. The more we perfect something, the further we drift from the natural rhythms that actually allow community to form. Real connection needs space to unfold in ways we can’t predict. We don’t know what will happen — and that’s the point.</p><p>Community doesn’t usually grow from perfection. It grows from proximity. It grows from repetition. It grows from the very ordinary act of being around each other without needing a grand reason.</p><p>Sometimes a simple “want to grab a coffee?” is more powerful than a six-part series with a mission statement. Sometimes sitting on the couch while someone cooks dinner does more than any beautifully crafted activation. Sometimes an unplanned walk with a neighbor teaches us more about connection than a structured meetup ever could.</p><p>Starting small keeps the door open. It lowers the stakes. It reminds us that community isn’t something we architect; it’s something we practice. And the more we practice, the easier it becomes to move from idea to action without needing the perfect design as permission.</p><p>If we want more community, the answer is often simple: start where we are, with what we have, and with whoever is already nearby.</p><h3>When we overly design, ordinary engagements can become exclusive clubs.</h3><p>There’s a difference between creating supportive structure and shaping something so tightly that only certain people feel welcome. Over-designing can quietly turn everyday engagements into exclusive clubs, even when the intention is inclusivity.</p><p>I recently read the article <a href=""https://www.notion.so/Designing-or-not-for-community-289649f8ce0b80ff94ede7742537e55e?pvs=21""><em>We’ve Squeezed the “Life” Out of Civic Life</em></a> by Sam Pressler for Connective Tissue, which explores how professionalism can stand in the way of true civic life. He writes:</p><p><em>“When we create ‘spaces’ or build ‘fields’ — as we’ve done throughout the social sector — we end up professionalizing and specializing sets of activities. And when we professionalize and specialize these activities, we signal that these activities are only for some people and not for everyone else. Professionalization and credentialization can help increase the ‘quality’ of practice within a field, but this is done by intentionally erecting barriers to that practice. These barriers show up through the training and credentialing activities themselves, and through the creation of insider cultures, languages, and networks.”</em></p><p>Pressler describes this as “professionalized management,” but it’s also another way of thinking about overly designed community spaces. We build structures to optimize and make things efficient, but when it comes to relationships, those same structures can quietly become obstacles for the dedicated people who were showing up and putting in time from the start.</p><p>He continues:</p><p><em>“The creeping professionalization of civic life has shifted the everyday democracy responsibilities of community membership and participation to the domain of nonprofit management. As credentialed managers assume the roles once held by ordinary citizens and neighbors, formal programs take the place of informal groups and activities, and participation and membership become experiences that are channeled and controlled rather than seen as holistic ways of being.”</em></p><p>When we professionalize or overly design the spaces meant to bring us together, we risk losing the informal, everyday participation that community depends on. Work shifts from ordinary neighbors to credentialed managers. We move from organic connection to structured programs and in the midst of it all, we loose sight on the natural rhythms of relationships. To keep engagement open and alive, we have to leave room for the unpolished, the unplanned, and the people who show up simply because they care.</p><h3>When we overly design, we limit surprise and magic.</h3><p>Many social clubs now have robust brands and curated activities that look more like shopping experiences than the social gatherings we used to know. In the article <a href=""https://grouphug.substack.com/p/what-we-lose-when-optimizing-community""><em>What We Lose When Optimizing Community</em></a>, community builder Elise Granata explores what we lose when we “Shopify” our social lives.</p><p>Run clubs, social retreats, and book clubs use polished online presences to attract members and entice participation. These experiences are meant to support us in the loneliness epidemic, but Granata highlights how their branded, tightly designed nature can create a barrier. We start to feel like we need to know exactly what we’ll get out of something before we go. We scan social accounts and websites to decide if it’s for us. The element of surprise disappears, and we show up expecting an outcome — or as Granata says, <em>“We lose the feeling that comes with a little mystery and a healthy amount of risk.”</em></p><blockquote><em>“When we don’t know exactly what’s going to happen, you know what happens? We get to be surprised.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>— Elise Granata</em></blockquote><p>This focus on expectation can get in the way of simply being with what is and letting curiosity and surprise guide our next moves.</p><p><a href=""https://www.priyaparker.com/the-new-rules-of-gathering"">Priya Parker</a> says every gathering needs a purpose. While I agree in some ways, there’s also a magic in the unplanned spaces that emerge from the natural <strong>rhythms of relationships.</strong> Reading a book while a friend watches reels. Crafting while someone is cooking. “Time together” might be the purpose, but does it really have to be predetermined?</p><p>Sometimes the purpose only emerges after the event has already happened. The people who show up create the purpose together rather than blend into a pre-determined one. Pre-determined purposes can end up placing expectations on what something is and isn’t.</p><h3>Finding the balance</h3><p>One of my guiding practices in design these days is to not only ask <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/from-how-might-we-to-at-what-cost-b635a595afd2""><em>how might we</em> but also <em>at what cost</em>.</a> This helps mitigate unintended consequences. Sometimes the thing we want to design for becomes the very thing we design against if we’re not careful.</p><p>Community, relationships, and connection are messy, unpredictable, and unpolished — and that’s where the magic happens. If we want real connection, we have to leave space for magic to unfold as we just hang out with our friends, say hello to our neighbors, or spend more time offline.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=2b5abca0046a"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/designing-or-not-for-community-2b5abca0046a"">Designing (or not) for community</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

A whole different ecosystem nobody prepares you for.</p><p>This first week taught me far more than I expected. No hype, no “SaaS in 10 minutes” screenshots, just the parts that genuinely helped me move, build, and understand how the tool actually is set up and behaves.</p><p>Here’s the beginner’s map I wish I had on day one:</p><h3>1. Your first prompt quietly decides your fate</h3><p>Your first prompt matters more than people think. It sets the tone for the entire build. Write it like a mini blueprint:</p><figure><img alt=""promting"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zQFhLxBP7bxN0HOmh_oQOQ.gif"" /></figure><p><strong>What I’m building =</strong> project overview<br /><strong>Who it’s for =</strong> target users<br /><strong>Main pages</strong> <strong>=</strong> app structure + future flow<br /><strong>Key feature</strong>s <strong>=</strong> core functionality + what’s coming later (login, payment…)<br /><strong>Design vibe =</strong> visual direction<br /><strong>What not to do = </strong>guardrails + exclusions<br /><strong>Ask for help = </strong>Tell Lovable to review the prompt and ask questions before building.</p><p>Fill this out with your vision and plan, then ask another LLM, like ChatGPT, to improve it for Lovable use.</p><p>📌 <strong>Extra Tip:</strong> If the first result feels messy or off, <strong>don’t try to rescue it</strong>. Start fresh with a cleaner prompt. It saves time and sanity.</p><h3>2. The Custom Knowledge file is the project’s brain!</h3><p>It's a bit hidden inside your settings, but it's fantastic! You drop in the rules and context you want, and Lovable carries them through everything it builds. You don’t need long essays, just a few sharp lines. Anything you’re sick of repeating goes here, and Lovable remembers it for the whole project. It’s not code. It’s guidance.</p><figure><img alt=""custom knowledge"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pg15n6Oj9xe-LH51nzoLtw.png"" /></figure><h3>3.

Restore.<br />Edit old messages to explore a different path without trashing your current work. This is the closest Lovable gets to emotional support.</p><figure><img alt=""histiry"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0CO2mUOaGu2tAe8Nzabd3A.png"" /></figure><h3>5.

<h4><strong>As AI mirrors how we design and learn, our role evolves from creating interfaces to defining the signals that shape intelligent experiences.</strong></h4><blockquote>A quick note before we dive in. This essay continues the thinking I introduced in <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/from-design-to-direction-bridging-product-design-and-ai-thinking-1d372707472d""><em>From design to direction: bridging product design and AI thinking</em></a>. While it is not required reading, it might give helpful context as I build on some of the ideas from that earlier exploration. Do not worry, I will be here when you return.</blockquote><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a signal plus a robot element representing AI will lead towards more targeted generative experiences."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*RMLNlIo1dX8HPoHTnndtPQ.png"" /><figcaption>Illustration for how signals will be key in a more generative experiential future.</figcaption></figure><p>In my first thought piece, I discussed how AI concepts overlap with the work of product designers as we optimize across three key levels: the interfaces we aim to make frictionless, the journeys that help users find value, and the connection to the business outcomes we hope to achieve.</p><p>That work is becoming even more important today. As AI-driven and generative tools move into our day-to-day workflows, the experiences we design no longer stop at the interface. Interfaces can now generate, adapt, and learn from what users do next. The quality of those learning loops depends on the quality of the signals we build into them.</p><p>As we move from static interfaces to generative ones, understanding the signals produced by our experiences and how those signals tie back to a user’s intent becomes foundational. These signals help generative systems reduce model loss, meet expectations, and continue doing what we care about most: helping people make progress in ways they find meaningful.</p><p>In this essay, I will share an approach for connecting instrumentation efforts to high-level business goals and how that prepares us to map signals to intent in ways that shape iterative optimization loops for generative experiences.</p><h3>Understanding what to measure: defining meaning before data</h3><p>There is a lot of writing out there about instrumentation and telemetry, so I will only touch on the basics here. Many of us have heard terms like attrition, cart abandonment, or error rate. We usually hear them through conversations with product managers who reference these numbers as indicators of progress or where improvements are sought after. But I would ask you if you truly know terms like these mean when thinking about the bigger picture?</p><p>Let’s start simple and work out from there by settling on two things. First, let’s define t<a href=""https://www.intercom.com/blog/finding-the-metrics-that-matter-for-your-product/"">elemetry as the raw data we collect.</a> Instrumentation, on the other hand, is the act of deciding which of those data points matter.</p><figure><img alt=""Image illustrating websites with numerous signals causing confusion for AI."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*_UH2OjwJE7okOjG565EFBQ.png"" /><figcaption>Imagine signals as a bunch of news stations all going at once at the same time with the same volume. Just like how we would be unable to focus intelligently, the same can be said for AI.</figcaption></figure><p>We could instrument every single action in a product, but without knowing what is <em>truly</em> meaningful, all we have is noise. The same challenge applies to AI systems, believe it or not. A model trained on large amounts of similar data might recognize correlations, but without context or intent, it cannot know where to focus.</p><p>Deciding what matters does two things. It guides our analysis toward insight instead of noise, and it makes our systems more efficient. Over-instrumentation, taught to me by my data and analytics partners at a prior role, increases storage and processing costs and makes it harder for both humans and machines to understand what users are trying to do.</p><p>By deciding what to focus on before we collect data, we can curate meaningful signals. These signals connect behavior to intent and intent to organizational outcomes. That is the foundation of this framework: shaping experience data so it becomes direction for both product teams and intelligent systems. Bare with me and let’s talk business.</p><h3>Defining what matters</h3><figure><img alt=""Illustration depicting certain telemetry signals being selected for instrumentation efforts to educate our teams and AI tools."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*xlEncsYKVieJ1yf2Zia9_A.png"" /><figcaption>When we contextualize signals around what is meaningful, both our teams and AI can start to make sense of all the noise.</figcaption></figure><p>When we design digital experiences, countless events occur on the front end and back end. Some happen autonomously, some because of user actions. Each is a potential signal, but we need a structured way to interpret them. One useful lens is <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/personas-jobs-be-done/""><em>Jobs to Be Done</em></a> (JTBD).</p><figure><img alt=""Framework illustration listing, from top down, company goal, organizational goal(s), Measurement objectives/OKRs, KPIs, and Signals to show how these support one another."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*aDjnFLyYqaFkBQOawVNIIw.png"" /><figcaption>Each row, from the bottom, should ladder up and support the goals above them to create a stable structure connecting in product signals up to company goals.</figcaption></figure><p>To start, most companies, no matter their size, are fundamentally trying to create value and generate revenue. If we acknowledge that end goal, we can place it at the top of our framework. You may already be familiar with terms like <a href=""https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/pricing-strategies-and-sales-proposals/get-to-know-your-revenue-model""><em>Average Contract Value</em> (ACV) or <em>Average Order Value</em> (AOV)</a>. These are common ways organizations measure growth and understand how customers perceive the value they offer.</p><figure><img alt=""Image illustrating overall framework with AOV filled in at top for company goal conveying all subsequent elements support this high-level goal."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*L59_F2lwhp5oHu-wNIHPhQ.png"" /><figcaption>We always need to identify the reason we do what we do, and typically it involves money.</figcaption></figure><p>Within companies, different groups support the business in different ways. For example, a large online store might have a website team focused on the digital shopping experience and a customer support team helping customers resolve issues. If increasing AOV is a company priority, the website team may set a goal like:</p><blockquote><strong>Improve cross-sell or upsell effectiveness.</strong></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Illustration of framework with example organizational goal."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*Adbi0dEL7_2z-nH_oUf97Q.png"" /><figcaption>Various internal organizations will have their own goals typically created at executive levels.</figcaption></figure><p>From there, we next have the <em>Measurement Objective</em>. This is where we identify the type of behavior we want to influence to support the organizational goal. It is common for multiple measurement objectives to exist for the same goal, especially in larger companies.</p><p>In our online store example, one measurement objective might be encouraging users to add additional items before checking out. To make this meaningful, we can express it as an OKR. Atlassian has a helpful overview of<a href=""https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/okr""> how OKRs function</a> in cross-functional teams if the concept is new.</p><p>A possible OKR might be:</p><blockquote><strong>Increase average items per cart from 1.6 to 1.9.</strong></blockquote><p>This is still fairly high-level, usually tied to a quarter or fiscal year, but it moves us closer to meaningful, measurable work.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of framework with example measurement objective added."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*fW7-KK5eZrBE0Y1H_WikAQ.png"" /><figcaption>Remember OKRs are not KPIs and sit at a higher level.</figcaption></figure><p>Below this sits the <em>Key Performance Indicator </em>(KPI) layer. KPIs are the specific metrics we can directly influence through design and iteration. They give us the levers we can adjust and monitor as we learn. If KPIs feel a little abstract, Asana has a <a href=""https://asana.com/resources/key-performance-indicator-kpi"">great explanation</a> of how teams use them as measurable signals of progress.</p><p>A related KPI might be:</p><blockquote><strong>Increase add-to-cart rate for recommended items by fifteen percent this quarter.</strong></blockquote><p>This gives teams something concrete to experiment with, design for, and measure.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of framework with example KPI filled in."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*muzWF_MjqtyjYKFjUOB4-w.png"" /><figcaption>KPIs can rotate quarterly (common) and still leave room for teams to ideate on how to meet that particular goal.</figcaption></figure><p>With all of this in place, we now have a path from:</p><blockquote><strong>AOV → organizational goal → measurement objective → OKR → KPI</strong></blockquote><p>Now we can move closer to the design layer: understanding user intent and determining the right signals to collect.</p><h3>Connecting signals to intent</h3><figure><img alt=""Illustration with signal section of framework filled in, directing audience to review table of examples below."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*ER93jIm8Wc3a22hlA9sWfg.png"" /><figcaption>As alluded to, there is no one end-all signal. It will take a critical look and collaboration across product and data and analytics teams to capture the right signals for your org.</figcaption></figure><p>Let’s assume our KPI example from before aligns with a JTBD that looks like this:</p><blockquote><strong>When I am shopping for something I need, I want to easily discover related or complementary items so my order feels complete.</strong></blockquote><p>To understand whether users are making progress toward that job, we need to collect telemetry data from key activities. Not every event will matter, but the right ones reveal intent.</p><figure><img alt=""Table of sample signal categories which related to overarching shopper Job detailing how they potential signal various intents AI could pick up on."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*v1HviC_KmaYp-a9xFEhkYQ.png"" /><figcaption>Examples of signals related to the core Job and their connection to identifying a shopper’s intent.</figcaption></figure><p>Signals help us see not only what users are doing but whether they are moving in the direction that represents meaningful progress. Positive signals show alignment. Negative signals reveal friction or mismatched intent.</p><p>This creates a full path from business outcomes down to the behaviors that reflect real value.</p><h3>How the framework extends into generative AI</h3><p>Everything up to this point applies to traditional products where designers create fixed interfaces. Generative experiences change the structure of the work. Instead of designing every step, we are designing the conditions a system uses to decide what to show, what to emphasize, and how to adapt.</p><p>Generative systems do not follow pre-built screens. They follow patterns, predictions, and signals.</p><p>In generative experiences, intent can surface explicitly through a question, a prompt, or a choice, or implicitly through behavior. <a href=""https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/"">Google’s PAIR guidebook</a> talks about this distinction between explicit intent and intent inferred from behavior, which forms the basis for how AI predicts what comes next.</p><p>Once the system infers intent, it predicts what the user needs next. That prediction determines what gets generated, whether that is a layout, a set of recommendations, content variations, or the next step in a flow. Even so, we still need a way to understand whether the prediction was correct. <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/guidelines-for-human-ai-interaction/"">Microsoft’s Human-AI Interaction Guidelines </a>reinforce this by encouraging systems to make their reasoning visible and understandable, so people can verify whether predictions make sense.</p><p>This is where the framework becomes essential. Organizational goals, OKRs, KPIs, and JTBDs give us a standard for what “good” looks like. They describe the journey and the progress that represent value for users. The signals we instrument become evidence of whether the generated experience actually supported that progress.</p><p>Even when a generative system produces something entirely new, we can still evaluate it. We are not comparing the UI to a previous layout. We are comparing behavior to expected signals. If users are moving forward, the inference was correct. If users hesitate, ignore content, or abandon, the system has made the wrong assumption. <a href=""https://openai.com/index/learning-to-summarize-with-human-feedback/"">OpenAI describes a similar idea</a> in their work on learning from human feedback, where systems compare predicted outcomes to desired ones.</p><p>This gives designers two places to focus optimization efforts. We can refine the experience that was generated, or we can refine how the system infers intent. Sometimes this means improving interface patterns. Sometimes it means strengthening the signals we collect. Sometimes it means giving users clearer ways to express what they want.</p><p>Either way, the work becomes the same. We check the signals produced by a generative interface against the expected signals tied to a JTBD, and we use that comparison to guide how the system adapts.</p><p>This is how designers contribute to AI-driven experiences. We are not only designing what users see. We are designing the understanding the system relies on to generate it.</p><h3>Where we go from here</h3><p>All of this sets up the next step. Generative systems cannot rely on signals alone. They also need to understand our components, patterns, and design systems in deeper, more semantic ways. <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/the-future-of-design-systems-is-semantic/"">Figma has written about this shift</a> in their guidance on semantic design systems, emphasizing that AI needs component meaning, not just component visuals, to generate interfaces responsibly.</p><p>In the next article, I will explore how semantic design systems help shape what generative systems create, and how that connects to the broader ideas of encoding, pattern representation, and meaning within AI models.</p><h3>Further reading</h3><p>If you would like to explore some of the ideas mentioned in this article, here are a few helpful starting points:</p><p><strong>Instrumentation and product measurement</strong><br /> • What is a KPI? — Asana<br /> <a href=""https://asana.com/resources/key-performance-indicator-kpi"">https://asana.com/resources/key-performance-indicator-kpi</a><br /> • How OKRs work — Atlassian<br /> <a href=""https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/okr"">https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/okr</a></p><p><strong>AI, intent, and prediction quality</strong><br /> • People + AI Guidebook — Google PAIR<br /> <a href=""https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/"">https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/</a><br /> • Learning from human feedback — OpenAI<br /> <a href=""https://openai.com/index/learning-to-summarize-with-human-feedback/"">https://openai.com/index/learning-to-summarize-with-human-feedback/</a><br /> • Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction — Microsoft Research<br /> <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/guidelines-for-human-ai-interaction/"">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/guidelines-for-human-ai-interaction/</a></p><p><strong>Design systems and meaning</strong><br /> • The future of design systems is semantic — Figma<br /> <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/the-future-of-design-systems-is-semantic/"">https://www.figma.com/blog/the-future-of-design-systems-is-semantic/</a></p><p>These pieces reflect similar themes around intent, signals, and how intelligent systems learn.

<h4><em>A shift towards token-first and AI-assisted systems</em></h4><p>Figma releases updates at a pace that feels pretty overwhelming. A new feature drops, you learn about the feature, then integrate it into your workflow. But soon after, more features are released and your workflow feels outdated again…like it’s an endless enhancement cycle.</p><p>For many designers, especially ones who manage large Design Systems, it’s hard to find time (and energy) to understand which features actually matter and how each Figma update affects your day-to-day work.</p><figure><img alt=""Figma features shown with component slots, Figma MCP, and extended collections"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HRFlQZdzrw0vNPHuxFgVIQ.png"" /></figure><p>But <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/schema-2025-design-systems-recap/"">Figma’s last few rounds of updates</a> focus on a token-first, structured, and AI-assisted workflow. Instead of circling around convenience features or quality of life updates, Figma is reshaping how Design System teams think about variables, code alignment, and how AI can expedite the process.</p><p>So which features should you focus on and what does each update actually mean for Design Systems? Let’s break down 3 critical updates recently rolled out with variables, component slots, and Figma MCP.</p><h3>Variables</h3><p>Variables have been at the forefront in supporting token-first systems. Figma recognized the common use case of multi-brand Design Systems, and its latest updates makes variables even more scalable. Let’s look at the new extended collections, new mode limits, and exporting variables.</p><h4>Extended collections</h4><p>There have been issues with multi-brand systems not meeting their adopter needs due to the limitations of Figma variables. Product teams would create hacks by copying variable collections into their own files, recreating themes, or even rebuilding token structures from scratch… meaning system updates and governance became broken across adopters.</p><p><strong>But with extended collections, Design System teams can support multiple brands/ products that require their own custom theme, while keeping variables in sync with the core system.</strong></p><p><strong>How extended collections work:</strong></p><ul><li>A Design System team publishes a core (parent) variable collection</li><li>Designers across the company can extend the core collection with their own brand-specific themes (overriding only the values they need)</li><li>The extended collections stay linked to the parent collection (and will inherit updates like new variables or token updates)</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Example of the extended collection’s modal for Figma variables"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DYlDw55gSnH-5KKWtZ_ymg.png"" /><figcaption>Extended collections allow multi-level branching</figcaption></figure><p><strong>But there are still limits of extended collections:</strong></p><ul><li>You cannot edit the variable’s alias name, scope, or mode in extended collections</li><li>Extended collections still require strong naming conventions and structure</li><li>Product designers may struggle to understand which token is pulling from where unless documentation is clear</li><li>They require more governance and a review process must be established for Design System members to ensure correct usage</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: Extended collections are only available for full seat users on Enterprise plans. I know many Organization plans also need this feature, so it’s disappointing it’s only available to premium accounts (please don’t shoot the messenger).</em></blockquote><h4>Increase in mode limits per plan</h4><p>Many Figma users have been personally victimized by how many modes were given to Professional and Organization plans. For instance, if a Design System supports 5 breakpoints (between X-Small and X-Large), they would not have been able to use variables to represent proper responsiveness. So the increase in how many modes you can use within each variable collection is better suited for team needs.</p><ul><li><strong>Professional:</strong> 10 modes per collection (up from 4)</li><li><strong>Organization:</strong> 20 modes per collection (up from 4)</li><li><strong>Enterprise:</strong> Unlimited modes with extended collections (up from 40)</li><li><strong>Starter:</strong> Not eligible (variables aren’t included in this plan)</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Figma variables showing many modes for a collection named “Breakpoints”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6n7IZQAtbtFR3ENo9SLh9g.png"" /><figcaption>Figma increased the amount of modes given to each plan type</figcaption></figure><p><strong>By increasing the capacity for modes, Figma is encouraging teams to move more variation into variables rather than building larger, heavier component libraries</strong>. Instead of teams finding “hacks” around the mode limitations, Design Systems can now have fewer overrides and duplicated components.</p><h4>Import and export as JSON</h4><p>Figma must have noticed many plugins were created to allow designers to import and export variables, like the <a href=""https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1256972111705530093/export-import-variables"">Export/Import Variables plugin</a>, because now they’ve introduced a built-in feature to serve this purpose.</p><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: Some accounts that should have this feature may still not have access (I still do not as of December 2025.)</em></blockquote><p><strong>Though it seems like a less significant update, it has huge implications for the maturity and governance of Design Systems</strong>. This helps teams adopt a “source of truth” mentality due to tokens from the design tools syncing with version-controlled repositories.</p><figure><img alt=""Demo of the import and export variables feature in Figma"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*X2y0XiNElF6zMr5bxZEziw.png"" /><figcaption><em>Image of import/ export variables feature from </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFjIaN_wlWg&amp;t=1313s""><em>Figma Schema</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Not only that, importing and exporting directly from Figma supports easier migration with fewer mistakes, automated updates of tokens, and a possible future of continuous integration between design and code.</p><h3>Component slots</h3><p>Figma components are powerful, but can also be rigid. If a designer needs to customize a component instance, they often have to find workarounds like detaching the component… a big “no-no” to Design System teams.</p><p><strong>But slots offer greater component flexibility without detaching. Basically, slots are placeholder containers inside components that let designers edit and customize content within an instance.</strong> And instead of relying on the Design System team to create product-specific components and increase library complexity, designers can insert the layer themselves.</p><p>Slots also allow Design Systems to specify which components are allowed inside a slot.

<h4>An exploration of causes, costs and competitive advantages connected to design maturity in product organisations</h4><figure><img alt=""A dark-themed slide titled “Design Maturity: Moving beyond usability to strategic advantage.” Below the title are three neon-style icons: a document labelled “FAQ” in orange, a central flowchart with the word “GOAL” in blue, and an “Opportunity Service Map” diagram in orange showing connected nodes."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HcVcbXVTWcub1SJiaQPbNA.png"" /></figure><p>High‑performing product organisations depend on maturity across all disciplines — design, product management, engineering, data, editorial, architecture. When one discipline is not being fully utilised, the whole organisation suffers, because maturity is systemic. But design maturity is sometimes misunderstood as a craft issue. Sometimes design is equated with usability. But true design maturity expands an organisation’s capacity to work well in uncertainty. So if you want to create the future, rather than just predict it, you need to find ways to achieve design maturity.</p><h3>Design maturity is more than usability</h3><p>I’m a design leader, so this matters to me personally. But a lack of understanding and investment in design maturity matters to everyone in a product organisation. When one function is underutilised, the entire system suffers. IDEO defines design as “sensemaking + imagination”. It’s the reason design is such a valuable partner to product management — <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/the-value-of-design-in-a-product-organisation-850661d1b22f"">design extends sense-making into difference-making</a>. Product management excels at sense-making. It synthesises data and combines analytical skills with empathy to make decisions and provide direction — ultimately holding accountability for the success of the product. But without design maturity, an organisation can lose out on the creativity and divergent thinking strengths of design. This comes with costs. <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20design/our%20insights/the%20business%20value%20of%20design/mckinsey-bvod-art-digital-rgb.pdf"">McKinsey’s <em>Business Value of Design</em> (2018)</a> found that design maturity correlates directly with financial and product performance.</p><p>But many organisations unconsciously define design too narrowly. The dominance of UX has led many non-designers to conflate and confuse the value of design with interaction design, usability and surface-level detail. Even <a href=""https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/"">Cagan’s model, for example, places design chiefly in the usability domain</a>. This framing is not wrong for managing delivery risk. But it reduces the perceived scope of design’s contribution. We’ve seen this in the past, when <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/"">Jakob Nielsen’s early usability heuristics</a> became the <em>default</em> definition of design work in low-maturity organisations.</p><p>But thinking of design as solely delivering “usability” within this context is limiting. “Usability” is necessary but not sufficient for an organisation to make the most of design. The result is a reduced role focused on UI, interaction flows, accessibility compliance and removing usability risks. This is all important, but it’s table stakes. When design gets trapped here, the organisation is often limited to incremental change. Organisations that use design only as a mechanism for managing usability risks do deliver safe, predictable, incremental improvements. But they might miss category-shifting ideas. They may also find themselves falling back to stakeholders for direction-setting or executing a <a href=""https://psychsafety.com/the-hippo/"">HIPPO’s vision</a>, because they’re underpowered in the skills needed to generate, communicate and manage diverse insights and ideas effectively. They’re likely to be limited to communicating vision in logic-biased prose rather than category shifting poetry that design-enabled product management is capable of.</p><h3>Climbing the ladder…</h3><p>When a product organisation is immature, design is equated with wireframes, flows, accessibility checks or research to eliminate risk. This work is necessary but insufficient for value creation. <a href=""https://ddc.dk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Design-Delivers-How-design-accelerates-your-business.pdf"">The Danish Design Ladder</a> describes how organisations evolve through:</p><ol><li><strong>Non-design</strong> — Design is absent or decorative.</li><li><strong>Design as styling</strong> — Form-giving, surface-level.</li><li><strong>Design as process</strong> — It’s an integrated element of development.</li><li><strong>Design as strategy</strong> — It’s a tool for shaping business models and futures.</li></ol><p>Most product‑influencer narratives peak at level 3 at best. But mature design can go further: into strategy, systems, and the shaping of opportunity itself.</p><p>The Danish Ladder says design will have the biggest impact when it’s deeply embedded in the strategic planning of an organisation. This is because design is a process of translation. Through artefacts, design translates ideas into value-generating products and services. As design undertakes this “translation” it also inevitably transforms ideas, manipulating constraints and capabilities to optimise the design. Design is therefore most effective when it’s able to influence both problem-framing and solutioning at the strategy level. Design isn’t art. It’s a process for solving real problems for real people by understanding them and getting creative to make progress and a positive difference.</p><p>When design is only allowed to operate at surface levels, or even when it’s called on to “execute” a strategy, you’re missing out on potential value. To non-designers this point might feel like “discipline inflation.” I get it, we all want to feel important. We all want a seat at the table. We all want to argue that we’re the secret to competitive advantage and need to “hold the pen” on the strategy. I don’t think that’s true for design in every context. The sense-making, convergent tendencies of product management mean that in most cases design shouldn’t be the dominant decision-maker in a product organisation. But they should be included in strategic work — and work that is most ambiguous — for the simple reason that designers are brilliant at having and managing ideas.</p><h3><strong>Idea management: The missing discipline?</strong></h3><p>Design is a systematic, creative, opportunity-generating discipline. When organisations misunderstand it as only enabling usability risk-management, they prevent themselves from operating at higher maturity. Organising around risk (value, usability, feasibility, viability) is sensible. But risk management isn’t the whole job. If you only reduce risk, you only reduce possibility.</p><p>Designers are trained to expand possibility and enable delivery by moving fluidly between divergence and convergence. A mature design practice surfaces new possibilities from research, signals, or anomalies. It looks across journeys, systems, and time — not just features. It detects patterns that suggest new value. It turns weak signals into opportunity areas. All of these core competencies of a skilled product designer are powerful and valuable — but so far, they’re not particularly unique to design. In some cases, they may even be more naturally suited to the convergent mindset of a product manager. But design does bring something extra. Design is a structured discipline for managing ideas. It doesn’t just detect patterns — it invents new ones. And it turns weak signals not just into opportunity areas, but into articulated opportunities that other disciplines can experience and understand quickly and cheaply to collaborate. Design done well looks like:</p><ul><li>Divergence (exploring many possibilities)</li><li>Convergence (narrowing to the strongest)</li><li>Visualisation (making intangible futures and assumptions visible and testable)</li><li>Iteration (enriching ideas through critique)</li><li>Integration (seeing relationships as systems and experiences emerge)</li></ul><p>Let’s look at the impact that this can have in practice…</p><h4><strong>Three hypothetical approaches</strong></h4><p>Imagine three different approaches to the same project. The context is high in ambiguity. The market context is highly competitive. To operate effectively the organisation needs to combine multiple talents, each with their own levels of maturity and different cultures. Likewise, the technical landscape is complex with a mixture of technical debt and emerging technologies that few in the team have experience of using. We step into the multiverse and see how three teams might approach the task:</p><p>Team A starts their discovery and execution by a PM creating a strong, detailed PRFAQ. It places users right at the centre of a story of the future. This sharpens the narrative across disciplines. It’s an inspiring picture that teams can get behind, so it<strong> a</strong>ligns stakeholders around a single vision. The FAQ section answers the questions that are front of mind. But the document imagines an end‑state rather than discovers one. It privileges linear, verbal thinkers who love prose. It’s like a piece of rhetoric, so it also risks a false certainty.</p><p>Team B create a detailed and comprehensive Opportunity Solution Tree (OST). It allows them to multi-track, exploring data and customer conversations to build an abstract map of opportunities. The team attaches data to branches to help prioritise the biggest opportunities and they work along branches, logically validating opportunities and bringing design skills in to generate possibilities. The team works on it together, collaboratively, sharing perspectives and having rich conversations amongst themselves and with users. It encourages exploration before convergence. And it helps the team track evidence and hypotheses together. But it’s weak at representing lived experience or systemic relationships — it’s an abstraction of a problem space. Sometimes the team struggles to navigate the structure of the ever-expanding tree. And it’s hard to hold the whole structure in your head at once. It makes systems thinking, journey‑based context, understanding time and flow harder, because it’s natively hierarchical rather than relational.</p><p>Team BBC is led by a skilled leader, experienced in multidisciplinary collaboration including design. They like the multi-tracking divergence and evidence-based decision-making of the OST, but they think that can make it even stronger. They create an Opportunity Service Map. It’s a shared artefact that still operates at an abstract level but brings the product landscape to life — it helps the team visualise experiences before, during and after customers interact with the product. It helps teams understand the experience and the backstage systems that power it. They talk to users, feeding in insight and operating with empathy. The team works collaboratively, as they do with the OST, but now they overlay opportunities directly onto a service blueprint. They’re curious, so they sidestep the “<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/teresatorres_continuousdiscoveryhabits-curseofknowledge-activity-7203470831937613825-vXO8/"">curse of knowledge</a>.” They start with problems and “why” questions, then they move to lo-fi ideation. They work collaboratively using techniques like <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/learn-how-to-use-the-best-ideation-methods-scamper?srsltid=AfmBOoqX9Jcf5a_86yRXxXxYHI2rBgB0r09EfY6vqnIzHcjoUEV84eb0"">SCAMPER</a> to explore and refine ideas. Then they prototype — they select the method depending on the concept and what assumptions they need to investigate. They regularly create cheap sacrificial concepts and test with users. Because the Opportunity Service Map shows frontstage, backstage, enablers, time, friction, confidence and impact it connects ideas and assumptions to the reality they operate in. This keeps exploration broad yet situated.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LzNFN2DEfGWpjG6c3stA2w.png"" /><figcaption>Limiting the impact of design to usability and execution is risky business. Divergence and convergence and a cocktail of multidisciplinary collaboration will usually lead to better results. But the top performing teams understand where and how design can add most value.</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Immaturity in one discipline hurts the whole system</strong></h3><p>The best teams I’ve ever worked in operate more like Team BBC. Teams A and B exhibit many strengths of an effective product team. But Team A’s design immaturity forces them to execute a vision that is handed to them. When a team uses a PRFAQ to translate customer obsession and insight into action, it’s a brilliant way to ensure decisions in delivery align with a coherent user outcome. But teams first need to be able to generate this insight and have invented a vision of how to meet it. A PRFAQ is evidence of the synthesising power of product management. It can boost accountability and provide a single-threaded leader with a contract to fulfil. But it won’t help you create.</p><p>Product management isn’t about managing a static thing — we’re managing not only what the product is and how it’s performing now, we’re often managing what it can and should become in the future. Product teams are responsible for delivery and discovery. Design maturity is so powerful because it introduces comfort and competence in dealing with the ambiguity of invention.</p><p>OSTs are therefore a signal of increased design maturity because they help encourage teams to work “outwards as well as backwards” — diverging and multitracking. This looks more like design — moving forwards <em>and</em> backwards, diverging and converging across multiple tracks, iterating to refine and optimise. Once you add in creating artefacts that act as experiments as you make progress, you see how and where design adds value.</p><p>Design helps teams explore from the present into multiple plausible futures before committing to one. An organisation without maturity in design might only ever develop the competence to work backwards from a chosen future or execute with an inherited or fixed set of constraints. With design maturity an organisation is much more likely to be able to blend the talents of product management and engineering with design to work forwards and backwards, manipulating problem-framing and solution-making to help the organisation find the most valuable future, no matter their context.</p><figure><img alt=""A side-by-side graphic comparing the Stacey Matrix and the Cynefin Framework.

Mature product teams know that some work is simple or complicated and work through it accordingly. The most mature teams can also identify and operate in complexity and chaos. To work well in complex domains you need strong, confident disciplines, distributed decision-making and a willingness to explore unknowns.</p><p>When design maturity is low, the whole organisation becomes less capable of operating in uncertainty. Product management might end up filling the gap — but you’re likely to have fewer, weaker ideas. Not because product managers and other disciplines can’t have ideas, but because design as a discipline has evolved to manage them most effectively. Each discipline has a core strength and purpose. This is why you need design — because it adds unique and valuable skills and because immaturity in one part becomes immaturity everywhere, as everyone is forced to generalise to fill the gap.</p><p>We can look at two helpful models to understand this further. Robert Kegan’s theory of adult development describes how people evolve in their “mental complexity” — their ability to reconcile ambiguity and competing truths. At the Socialised Mind, identity and direction are shaped by the expectations of others. Decisions are anchored in fitting in, meeting external standards and aligning with prevailing norms.</p><p>At the Self-Authoring Mind, individuals develop an internal compass. They can understand and appreciate the expectations of others while also generating their own frameworks for judgement and action.</p><p>A smaller group shift further into the Self-Transforming Mind, where they can integrate multiple frames at once and work flexibly in paradox, ambiguity and change. Kegan talks about individuals. But I think you can use these stages to describe teams.</p><figure><img alt=""A diagram showing Robert Kegan’s three stages of adult development — Socialised Mind, Self-Authoring Mind, and Self-Transforming Mind — mapped along a horizontal timeline. Each stage includes traits such as reliance on external expectations, developing an internal compass, and integrating multiple perspectives. The diagram also includes brief labels describing how leaders operate at each stage. Kegan talks about these levels in the context of personal development in his book An Everyone Culture."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kUuz2i-GCGtp-gfyfEXscg.png"" /></figure><p>A multidisciplinary team mirrors these stages. A Socialised-level team performs competently within the dominant discipline’s worldview (often PM or engineering). They optimise for alignment and predictability — they “organise to execute”. A Self-Authoring team begins to define its own integrated way of working across disciplines by co-creating a shared approach grounded in collective purpose and context — they’re empowered to solve problems. A Self-Transforming team goes further: it can switch modes depending on the problem space — convergent when needed, divergent when needed, exploratory in uncertainty, decisive in clarity — they’re <strong>empowered to find problems</strong> and invent the future.</p><p>Operating in ambiguity demands high maturity across disciplines. The lowest common denominator of people playing multiple roles or the over-dominance of a single discipline won’t work. Strength and maturity in each discipline is required, so that the organisation and its teams aren’t trapped by any one discipline’s identity but can metabolise all of them to meet the moment. When teams mature to this point, they stop behaving as a collection of functions and start operating as an adaptive system capable of solving harder, more ambiguous problems than any discipline could manage alone.</p><p>Kegan’s developmental lens pairs naturally with Amy Edmondson’s work on psychological safety and teaming. Edmondson argues that in environments of high uncertainty and high interdependence teams perform best when members can speak up, question assumptions, surface risks, and integrate diverse perspectives without fear. That’s only possible when individuals move beyond the Socialised Mindset and when the team behaves at a Self-Authoring or even Self-Transforming level — able to adapt how it works together.</p><h4>Building maturity</h4><p>When design is strong, every discipline benefits. In simple or complicated contexts, disciplines can operate independently and with lower levels of maturity. Product management can set a goal, engineering can implement with rigour, design can ensure usability. But as complexity increases, the future stops being something you predict and starts being something that emerges from interaction. At a certain point, predicting becomes riskier than designing. No discipline has the full picture. You need the exploration, translation and reframing muscles that design brings — finding gaps and opportunities, making ideas tangible, and helping the team update its understanding of the problem, the constraints and what’s possible. At its best, design surfaces opportunities before they calcify into problems, synthesises research into multi-level insights, prototypes to explore strategy (not just UI), and connects journeys, systems and stories into experiences that actually matter. It helps shape direction alongside PM, engineering, editorial, data and architecture — but only when it’s included early enough, high enough and meaningfully enough.</p><p>Maturity rarely develops evenly across an organisation. But you can accelerate the maturity of design by involving and empowering designers where ambiguity, opportunity and risk are highest. These are the areas where linear planning breaks down, expertise alone stops being enough, and teams need experimentation, creativity and distributed judgement.</p><p>Simple shifts can bring greater design maturity to an organisation:</p><ul><li>investing in framing as well as solving</li><li>intentionally cycling through divergence and convergence</li><li>mapping opportunities into the systems they live within</li><li>critiquing ideas to sharpen, not to narrow — and to build rather than diminish creative confidence</li><li>pairing narrative tools (PRFAQ) with experiential ones (prototypes) and making richer abstractions of opportunity spaces — finding ways to show, not just tell people what the future should be like.</li></ul><p>Importantly, these shifts don’t weaken other disciplines — they strengthen them. They help PM and engineering build design literacy without forcing those teams to compensate for an underpowered design function.</p><p>Design maturity isn’t about risk reduction; it’s about strategic advantage. It helps organisations spot new value early and gives teams the confidence to pursue it. If you expect your organisation to shape the future, not just survive it, your teams need the maturity to discover, deliver <strong><em>and</em></strong> design what comes next. The future we prefer won’t arrive ready-made — it will be built by the organisations that design it.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9f45fd4e20c3"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/why-you-need-design-maturity-in-a-product-organisation-and-how-to-get-it-9f45fd4e20c3"">Why you need design maturity in a product organisation, and how to get it</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

This usually happens when the menu is extensive and the dishes don’t differ much from one another.</p><p>The reason behind this lies in the <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/hicks-law/""><em>Hick–Hyman Law</em></a>, which states that <strong>the time required to make a decision increases with the number of available choices.</strong> In other words, the more options we offer our users, the harder it becomes for them to make a confident decision and the longer it takes.</p><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._Hick"">William Edmund Hick</a>, in his study <a href=""https://www2.psychology.uiowa.edu/faculty/mordkoff/InfoProc/pdfs/Hick%201952.pdf""><em>On the Rate of Gain of Information</em></a>, examines entropy and bits in the context of perception. Through his experiment, he concludes that human perception functions as a channel through which information flows, and the capacity of this channel is limited. Therefore, the more bits of information that need to be transmitted, the longer the transmission will take.</p><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Hyman"">Ray Hyman</a>, in his subsequent article <a href=""https://www2.psychology.uiowa.edu/faculty/mordkoff/InfoProc/pdfs/Hyman%201953.pdf""><em>Stimulus Information as a Determinant of Reaction Time</em></a>, not only experimentally confirms Hick’s findings but also refines them. He adds that not only the amount of information but also different combinations of information chunks influence the speed at which it is transmitted. This is how the Hick–Hyman Law was born.</p><figure><img alt=""A black-and-white photo of a man standing at a podium (left) addressing an audience, with three panelists seated at a long table behind him."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*uI4-UKceI6xHWEjO.jpg"" /><figcaption>Ray Hyman by Robert Sheaffer. <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=24738861"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>The restaurant industry uses this law consciously: for instance, high-end restaurants often limit the number of dishes on their menu to reduce decision time and the stress that customers experience at the moment of choice.</p><p>But both approaches work. It all depends on the business model.<br />Lower-priced restaurants rely on the idea that you’ll order as many dishes and snacks as possible. Given the lower prices, the time spent browsing the menu can actually increase the average check, which is why they’ll often leave an extra menu on your table, inviting you to keep exploring.</p><figure><img alt=""Big menu on a wall of small restaurant"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/715/0*azhh8mbVmuKteBzz.jpg"" /><figcaption>Example of big menu. <a href=""https://favbulous.com/post/7102/secret-tips-and-tricks-behind-a-restaurant-menu"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>In “fancy restaurants”, however, it’s much harder to raise the average check this way. The focus shifts instead to creating a memorable experience that makes the guest want to return. And to do that, the goal is to pull the customer away from the menu as early as possible and start “delivering the show”: the sommelier, the open kitchen, the service, the atmosphere. It’s all part of the same psychological choreography.</p><p>We can apply the same logic to the world of design. For example, by hiding secondary filters under an accordion, we can reduce the delay before the first user action by roughly one-third.</p><p>Apple uses a similar principle. On their website, you can’t compare more than three products at once. You’re always making a choice among a maximum of three options. For Apple, the time from the start of the user flow to the moment of purchase is one of a key metrics and offering more alternatives would only slow down decision-making.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of compare function on Apple Website"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*A0aIHqR3VhkhNDbstU6xSA.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot of compare function (<a href=""https://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/"">Apple.com</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3>Cognitive Load Theory</h3><p>Of course, I think the title already gives it away. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sweller"">John Sweller</a> in <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1207/s15516709cog1202_4""><em>Cognitive Load During Problem Solving: Effects on Learning</em></a> states that <strong>our working memory is limited </strong>and this directly affects both how we process information and how we make decisions. In other words according to <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/cognitive-load/"">Cognitive Load Theory</a> we’re not comfortable solving large or complex problems all at once.</p><figure><img alt=""Smiling elderly man wearing glasses outdoors."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*XrUIXxGR10nXSjay.png"" /><figcaption>John Sweller. <a href=""https://neshnikolic.com/podcast/john-sweller"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Have you ever noticed that when you go to an upscale restaurant, the food menu and the wine list are presented separately and often by different people? The waiter handles the main menu, while the sommelier, trained specifically to guide and advise on wine, takes care of the rest.</p><figure><img alt=""Sommelier pours the wine into a decanter."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*QBPkjrpYmM4HIAcT.jpg"" /><figcaption>Sommelier pours the wine into a decanter. <a href=""https://hospitalityinsights.ehl.edu/psychology-role-design-michelin-star-restaurant-wine-menu"">Image Sourse</a></figcaption></figure><p>Even in more casual restaurants, the waiter usually approaches the table with a specific question: “Have you decided what you’d like to drink?”</p><p>For context: I live in Germany, and this is a standard part of the customer flow here. In my home culture, however, the question usually goes the other way around: “Have you decided what you’d like to eat?” but not what to drink. So I often catch German waiters off guard when I say: “Please come back later for the drinks, but I’m ready to order the food.”</p><p>But the real lesson here is that everyone in this process knows their role and timing. You’re not expected to make all your choices at once. You start by focusing on the drinks (a small, simple decision) and only afterward the waiter gives you additional time to choose your meal.</p><p>And, of course, in design we try to take this natural limitation of the brain into account. That’s why we often split long registration forms into three short steps. This way, the user isn’t overwhelmed by a wall of questions on a single page. Instead, they move through the process gradually, with focused attention at each step, which reduces cognitive load and increases completion rates.</p><p>Or take Apple, for example. When you’ve already compared three different devices, chosen your new desired iPhone, and clicked the Buy button, a new quest begins: the configuration page.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Product configuration page on Apple Website"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*e_S70WT8ETmQiK3Gs6xxZw.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot of Configuration page (<a href=""https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-air"">Apple.com</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The magic of this page lies in the fact that you’re never asked one big, abstract question like “What do you want?”. Instead, you’re guided through a series of small, sequential choices, where each step is a separate task. The entire process is designed to prevent you from overthinking how your final selection will look. Everything unfolds gradually, with minimal complexity, and without showing all the options at once.</p><p>And even when we can see several questions on the page at once, they make all inactive options unselectable, as if showing us the only correct path for configuring the device.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Product configuration page on Apple Website"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BdOC6Wc7jdYKQHWsQL90YQ.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot of Configuration page (<a href=""https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-air"">Apple.com</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Apple, in general, uses plenty of clever tricks to sell us what they want us to buy, rather than what we initially came for. One good example is the Pricing Ladder a tactic perfectly explained by MKBHD in a <a href=""https://youtube.com/shorts/NiNYOZZLOyg?si=kw9xYmQvrJhdcjA4"">one-minute video</a> that I highly recommend watching before you buy your next Apple device.</p><p>At the same time, other companies can use these techniques against us, essentially bombarding us with constant stimuli and information. Take the AliExpress app, for example. Before you even reach the actual products, you’re overloaded. You’ll see a spinning prize wheel three times, be told about two free gifts, be invited to play a game to win an extra discount, and only after all these circles of hell will you finally reach the main page. And even there, you’re hit with a dozen more psychological triggers, all carefully designed to wear down your cognitive defenses and fill your cart with things you never intended to buy.</p><figure><img alt=""Product page showing wireless earbuds with charging case on Temu."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9fi-SRlclHTlZely7ctCYA.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot of overwhelming Product page (<a href=""https://www.temu.com/-new-wireless-earbuds-for-running-sports-wireless-earphones-with-earhooks-pure--sound-over-ear-headphones-enc-noise-cancelling-with-dual-led-display-earphones-built-in-microphone-g-601099512659332.html?_oak_mp_inf=EIT7tJem1ogBGhZmbGFzaF9zYWxlX2xpc3RfejFqNjkxILuFwt%2BtMw%3D%3D&amp;top_gallery_url=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.kwcdn.com%2Fproduct%2F1e23310424%2F15bb81f1-bb50-420f-88da-13f8b03f85c7_1600x1600.jpeg&amp;spec_gallery_id=601099512659332&amp;refer_page_sn=10132&amp;refer_source=0&amp;freesia_scene=116&amp;_oak_freesia_scene=116&amp;_oak_rec_ext_1=MjM0NQ&amp;refer_page_el_sn=201401&amp;_x_channel_src=1&amp;_x_channel_scene=spike&amp;_x_sessn_id=dfl5866dsz&amp;refer_page_name=lightning-deals&amp;refer_page_id=10132_1764626564415_d6jkn51kcm"">Temu</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The same approach is used by Temu and other simillar apps. Some might say this is just a regional design style common in Asian markets, but I’d counter that argument with Candy Crush, which uses the same cognitive overload mechanics and was created by a Swedish company for a Western audience.</p><h3>Fitts’s Law</h3><p><strong>The time it takes for a person to reach or interact with a target depends on the distance to the target and its size</strong>, according to <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/fittss-law/"">Fitts’s Law</a><em>. </em>The closer and larger the target is, the faster and easier it is to click or tap on it.</p><p>In his article <a href=""https://www2.psychology.uiowa.edu/faculty/mordkoff/infoproc/pdfs/Fitts%201954.pdf""><em>The Information Capacity of the Human Motor System in Controlling the Amplitude of Movement</em></a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Fitts"">Paul Fitts</a> not only quantitatively measured the influence of target size and distance on the action performed with it, but also argued that the motor–nervous system has a limited processing capacity, which imposes constraints on the speed and accuracy of our reactions.</p><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white portrait of a man in a suit and bow tie."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2-lVJtDadnVMpeyttm_8jw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Paul M. Fitts. <a href=""https://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bhl/x-hs15404/hs15404"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>In our restaurant example, this could be something like a table tent featuring the dishes of the week, the chef’s recommendations, or the daily lunch specials.</p><p>The manager may not be consciously thinking about Fitts’s Law, but they instinctively know that if a guest sees the lunch specials right away during lunchtime, it can influence how quickly they place an order. Since this option is physically close to the customer and visually prominent, it perfectly satisfies both conditions of Fitts’s Law: proximity and target size.</p><figure><img alt=""Hard Rock table tent dessert menu display featuring sundaes and milkshake bites."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*baWG3S9OxBQ3P_5o.jpg"" /><figcaption>Table Tent. <a href=""https://www.behance.net/gallery/20475989/Hardrock-Cafe-tent-cards"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Let’s take Apple again as an example. When we walk into an Apple Store, we see a large number of devices neatly arranged on tables. And there’s a clear logic behind how they’re placed, including the influence of Fitts’s Law.</p><figure><img alt=""Modern tech store interior with display tables, staff, and a central glass staircase."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/816/0*F_ia-vEjHfQ52Tlh.jpg"" /><figcaption>Apple Store on 5th Avenue. <a href=""https://www.apple.com/de/newsroom/2019/09/apple-fifth-avenue-the-cube-is-back/"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Notice the height of the tables and the way the devices are positioned: everything is arranged so that it’s as easy and natural as possible for you to reach out and touch them. After all, the store’s primary goal isn’t just to sell devices, it’s to let you experience them. Ideally, Apple wants you to pick them up, test the new iPhone Pro or Air, listen to the headphones, or sketch on an iPad. Apple designs the entire environment so that you never have to stretch or hesitate. The devices seem to magically fall into your hands.</p><h3>Bringing it all together</h3><p>We saw how limiting the number of choices can accelerate decision-making, how breaking complex processes into smaller steps can reduce cognitive strain, and how proximity and scale can influence the speed and ease of action.</p><p>From restaurant menus to digital interfaces, from Apple’s carefully guided flows to AliExpress’s sensory chaos, the same psychological mechanisms are at play. They remind us that design is never neutral: every pixel, choice, and delay subtly shapes human behavior.</p><p>Of course, these are only a few examples. There are many more behavioral laws and cognitive principles worth exploring such as: <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/von-restorff-effect/"">Von Restorff effect</a>, <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/teslers-law/"">Tesler’s Law</a>, of course, the well-known <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/occams-razor/"">Occam’s Razor</a>, which we as designers should always keep close and others that I recommend you take a look at on this very handy website — <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/"">https://lawsofux.com/</a>.</p><p>I encourage you not only to look into them, but to experiment with it your self, and find the right balance for your product. And let’s always approach our users with respect and empathy, using our understanding of human nature for good, not manipulation.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e5fb08e7917a"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/designing-decisions-behavioral-psychology-that-moves-users-e5fb08e7917a"">Designing decisions: Behavioral psychology that moves users</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4><strong>Inside the movement rethinking the design of our cities, spaces and systems through the wonder of nature</strong></h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wRvYZJf5q2NlRGawmGmr0A.jpeg"" /><figcaption>The aerial view back towards Victoria Station (Credit: Ricardo Frantz, via Unsplash)</figcaption></figure><p>As I step off the train at London’s Victoria Station and make my way through the concourse, I can’t help but feel part of <em>something</em>.</p><p>Maybe I’ve been exclusively working from home for too long. Maybe it’s the separation from the human energy of urban centres. Or maybe it’s simply excitement for where I’m heading today.</p><p>I join the commuters spilling out into the surrounding streets like a burst dam, meandering through buses, traffic lights and signposts. As I walk further, the torrents thin as people are absorbed into glass fronted offices and revolving doors, until it feels like I’m the last one walking.</p><p>Suddenly, in front of me, the gothic towers of Westminster Abbey rise up. I ponder the pioneering architects who imagined it, and the brave souls who built it. I consider the sovereigns it’s crowned, wedded and mourned, and the wonderful sense of awe it’s provided through the ages.</p><p>Before I’ve taken a dozen more steps, I hear the famous chimes of Big Ben. It appears behind the Abbey, a golden marvel glittering in the gloom, and standing guard to the adjoining Houses of Parliament. I wonder what it’s like to bear witness to some of Britain’s most profound moments and movements.</p><p>It’s the perfect introduction to my purpose today: the 2nd <a href=""https://journalofbiophilicdesign.com/biophilic-design-conference"">Biophilic Design Conference</a> in Central Hall Westminster, London. A wonderful event that brings together the world’s leading architects, interior designers, urban planners, creatives and innovators — with a mission to create a healthier, more resilient and regenerative world.</p><p>Here are my reflections on a day spent exploring a vibrant, biophilic future.</p><h3>There’s a shifting mindset to systemic change.</h3><p>The first clue arrived in the theme of the day: <em>“Biophilic Design for a Regenerative Future”</em>.</p><p>Sustainability is out! Regeneration is in! But the distinction is an important one. Regenerative design goes beyond traditional sustainability ambitions to create systems and structures that cause a net-positive impact on both environment and society.</p><p>In simpler terms, rather than finding a point of equilibrium, it recognises the damage we’ve done to our natural ecosystems and seeks to both restore and regenerate those systems.</p><p>Regenerative design also recognises the viewpoint that human and natural systems are deeply interwoven and interconnected. The global crises we face today such as climate, biodiversity loss and mental health are not standalone issues, but symptoms of a deeper disconnection between humanity and nature.</p><p>I loved this quote from Donella Meadows, author of <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Thinking-Systems-Primer-Donella-Meadows/dp/1603580557"">Thinking in Systems</a>, as shared by Luke Engleback in his talk about ecourbanism<em>:</em></p><blockquote>“Systems happen all at once. They are connected not just in one direction, but in many directions simultaneously.”</blockquote><p>As the day progresses, it’s clear that this mindset shift is still evolving. Many talks tend to zoom in towards individual crises like climate — whereas the real predicament to overcome remains our systemic disconnection from nature.</p><p><em>(If you’re interested in exploring more about the processes and thinking behind regenerative design, I found </em><a href=""https://medium.com/@ernesto-87727/the-art-of-regenerative-design-26bde27f72f8""><em>this article</em></a><em> a really good starting point).</em></p><h3>“There’s no such thing as neutral space.”</h3><p>If there’s one takeaway from the whole day, — and indeed the keynote from <a href=""https://www.farrowpartners.ca/"">Tye Farrow</a>, leading architect and author of the wonderful book <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Constructing-Health-Built-Environment-Enhances/dp/1487557221"">Constructing Health</a> — I think it’s this.</p><p>I love the simplicity of the message. That our built environment will take us one of two ways: it can undermine health, or it can cause health. It’s a phrase that encourages action in a subtle yet profound manner.</p><figure><img alt=""Outside terracing beneath a beautiful, curved, wooden structure designed by Farrow Partners"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QdyzpwegHyTmMPWdr5WWfQ.png"" /><figcaption>SZMC Helmsley Cancer Center, Israel (Credit: Farrow Partners)</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve read Tye’s book, which has become a feature on my desk over the past 12 months. It’s the best summary I’ve found for exploring the very nature of biophilic and salutogenic design through architectural research that draws on fields including environmental psychology and neuroscience. It’s also a beautiful publication.</p><p>Tye’s focus on health is a critical reminder not just of the core focus of biophilic design, but what <em>all</em> design could be — and its basis in the natural world.</p><p>Architects are the undisputed forerunners, but there’s plenty of industries <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/5-biophilic-ux-solutions-for-a-sustainable-future-5d58a217649c"">exploring this further.</a></p><h3>Focusing on children is both heart-warming and mission critical.</h3><p>I found it incredibly moving to hear of wonderful businesses and approaches focused on offering the youngest minds of our world the experiences for a different future.</p><p>Adam White and Andrée Davies, founders of <a href=""https://www.davieswhite.co.uk/"">Davies-White Ltd</a>, are landscape architects specialising in nature-connected family friendly landscapes and gardens, created through the use of natural, sustainable materials. Their work exemplified how biophilic projects can capture the attention of leading advocates of the natural world, such as Sir David Attenborough and the Princess of Wales, but most importantly, how these biophilic spaces empower children.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vxDYbodWXa1aOcuit3nVWw.png"" /><figcaption>The Wild Garden at Caudwell International Children’s Centre at Keele University, supporting children with developmental disabilities (Credit: Davies-White Ltd)</figcaption></figure><p>Similarly, it was brilliant to see <a href=""https://www.theschoolofbiophilia.co.uk/"">School of Biophilia</a> exhibiting — inspired, I’m told, by last year’s conference. Their focus is on sharing the power of biophilia to connect people with the natural world, focused not just on schools, but also businesses and workplaces too.</p><p>For me, it was a timely reminder that nature reconnection is a long term mission that arguably requires the young more than any other demographic. And given our connections with nature are often forged in childhood, it’s a critical area of focus for today.</p><h3>Cities can drive change. But it shouldn’t stop there.</h3><p>Figures shared from the World Economic Forum’s BiodiverCities project attribute cities being responsible for 80% of global GDP. They also contribute around 75% of greenhouse gases, and consume 75% of natural resources. When you consider they house 54% of the global population, the imbalance is clear.</p><p>From an urban planning and architectural perspective, I can understand why cities present a major opportunity for change. As Nick Grayson, former Climate Change Sustainability and Green City Manager at Birmingham City Council shared:</p><blockquote>“Nature underpins the whole growth and quality of life agenda yet most cities see nature as a maintenance issue and a cut-able budget”.</blockquote><p>Birmingham was already seen as one of Europe’s greener cities, but through the lens of the <a href=""https://www.millenniumassessment.org/en/index.html"">Millenium Ecosystem Assessment</a>, uncovered critical need to improve the quality, size and connectedness of its green spaces to ensure nature provided wider societal benefits in areas like wellbeing, climate resilience, and managing economic risk.</p><figure><img alt=""Curving pathway covered by a deep canopy of trees"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DSsmEFPtFejzDl_SQFpL1g.png"" /><figcaption>City of Nature Plan (Credit: Bimingham City Council)</figcaption></figure><p>It’s response was to trail blaze a new governance model for cities to place nature at the heart of their overall strategy. Nature now lies at the centre of the whole council plan — including housing, children, health and jobs — and helped Birmingham to the exciting accolade of becoming the UK’s first “<a href=""https://naturallybirmingham.org/birmingham-city-of-nature-delivery-framework/"">City of Nature</a>”.</p><p>As Rob Delius, Head of Sustainability at design practice <a href=""https://stridetreglown.com/"">Stride Treglown</a>, shared whilst drawing on the example of Singapore:</p><blockquote>“Cities can completely reimagine themselves as a city in nature.”</blockquote><h3>But what about the indoors?</h3><p>Plans to transform cities into truly biophilic spaces are incredibly exciting and urgently required. But there’s clearly a need to go further, and <em>inside</em> these spaces too.</p><p>The average person spends 90% of their time <em>indoors</em> (a much travelled figure now decades old but rarely disputed). It’s where most of us spend a whopping <em>22 hours</em> of our day working, resting and sleeping.</p><p>It’s our indoor spaces that offer the ripest opportunity for paradigm-shifting change, if we get it right. Digital interventions are one route that can magic the ultimate biophilic experiences through personal, scalable and effective nature-powered spaces to transform health and performance.</p><p>It also leans into another topic that came up a number of times in conversations I had at the conference — the importance of designing for neurodiversity.</p><p>As our understanding around conditions like ADHD and autism improve, it reveals how poor certain spaces are for supporting these people. Leaning into digital offers up new opportunities for personalising individual spaces to suit different types of people, tasks and needs with effortless ease.</p><h3>Artificial intelligence can support natural intelligence.</h3><p>Beyond <a href=""https://www.moodsonic.com/"">Moodsonic</a>, a generative soundscape creator for workplaces, hospitals and education, I’m not sure I heard AI mentioned once at the conference.</p><p>This exclusion felt neither deliberate nor coincidental, but perhaps further symptomatic of a world where humanity and nature do remain extraordinarily separate.</p><p>There’s no doubt AI can be a major accelerant for the biophilic design movement. It’s not about competing with nature but creating meaningful ways to interweave its magic with our daily lives.</p><p>Visuals, sounds, air quality, lighting and temperature all contribute to the “feel” of our environments, impacting the way we think, feel and behave. They can increasingly be measured, assessed and recreated, ultimately crafting adaptive environments that offer direct evidence-based health interventions, and can instantly respond to our changing physiological needs.</p><p>It will help close the gap between design intent and real-world outcomes — bringing more science into the art of design. It can help create spaces that don’t just <em>feel</em> biophilic, but are <em>quantifiably</em> biophilic too.</p><p>There’s a lot to talk about here, and we’ll undoubtedly see and hear much more in future months of wonderful examples where AI has helped unlock some truly innovative biophilic solutions.</p><h3>We’re still stuck with numbers.</h3><p>One of the recurring frustrations I’ve heard from members of the biophilic design community is despite the long-standing and irrefutable evidence in support of biophilic design, it still struggles to scale.</p><figure><img alt=""Tropical plants contained within a large spherical dome"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_e4yWEHYbLs8eCYqhGaJiw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Places like the plant-filled spheres at Amazon’s Head Offices, Seattle, are rare and expensive (Credit: <a href=""https://www.dezeen.com/2018/01/30/plant-filled-seattle-spheres-open-amazon-headquarters/"">Dezeen</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>As summarised by Oliver Health, founder of design consultancy <a href=""https://www.oliverheathdesign.com/"">Oliver Health Design</a>, biophilic design remains silo’d by factors including cost, education, research adoption, regulation and procurement.</p><p>But I also think it remains misunderstood outside the industry. Beyond the numbers of percentage uplifts in productivity, wellbeing and performance — which come from environmental psychologists, architectural practices and design businesses, lie <em>human</em> stories. And we’re less good at making these the heroes of our ambitions.</p><p>To draw on Nick Grayson once more, he touched on the power of seeking “Earth Stories” to both engage locals in plans to transform Birmingham into a true “City of Nature” and to draw out people’s own realisations of the proximity of nature to people’s own faith, quality of life and way of living.</p><p>The power of storytelling is something I’ve learned a lot from my time at <a href=""http://portal.app/experience"">Portal</a>. We’ve tried to avoid dry statistics of how Portal might make people feel “27% less stressed”, or help “83% of customers sleep better”, in favour of sharing genuine, wholesome customer stories.</p><p>We’ve heard of Portal being used from childbirth to end-of-life care, to create the most beautiful and dignified experiences. We’re heard of its usage in war zones like Ukraine to protect children from the sounds of bombs landing on their city, and help them find sleep. We’ve heard of Portal helping customers manage challenging conditions like psychosis, narcolepsy and autism.</p><p>We humans are a species that communicate through stories. If we’re to create products and experiences that connect people with the natural world, then its stories — not stats — that we should champion to spread our message.</p><h3>Our biophilic future requires a connection of hearts and minds.</h3><p>Reflecting on the day, I find myself returning to the Birmingham example once more, and the realisation that their green city had so much more headroom to grow.</p><blockquote>“Birmingham’s nature wasn’t big enough, joined up enough or high enough quality to be able to reach all its citizens to give them wellbeing. It wasn’t sufficient to stand up to climate resilience and risk, and put the city at economic risk. We knew we had to do something.”</blockquote><p>I feel the same about our biophilic community. The day shared countless examples of brilliant projects, businesses and initiatives, and I hope the next 12 months sees more of us collaborate in the name of health and nature connection.</p><p>To take the NHS as an example, there were plenty of examples throughout the day of the application of biophilic principles in care, treatment and recovery settings, but I could feel the frustration at the difficulty of rolling out these successes at greater scale.</p><p>In my mind, the key challenge is to shift <em>hearts and minds</em> — of decision makers, creators and communities. Our strongest hand to achieve this is by continuing to create the most incredible experiences, sharing the human stories of transformation that lie behind them, and collaborating.</p><p>I hope, driven by values in community and connection, we can continue to surface more evidence and inspiration to improve the quality of what we do, and ensure nature-powered design spreads deeper across all industries.</p><p>With nature, we have a beautiful, wise and magical companion — it’s time to rediscover that flourishing future together.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=d896346da3c3"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/biophilic-design-is-the-wellness-revolution-happening-all-around-us-d896346da3c3"">Biophilic design is the wellness revolution happening all around us</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4><strong>How outdated decision logics are undermining Labour’s ambitions for a mission-driven government.</strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Illustration depicting A to B problem-solving which ignores the complexity around us."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*OlV0rTXNIS06whCZ.png"" /><figcaption>Image credit: <a href=""https://www.businessillustrator.com/"">Virpi Oinonen</a></figcaption></figure><p>Given Labour won the last general election on the promise of national renewal and a mission-driven state with a “relentless focus on long-term ends” after years of crisis management — frustration is understandable. After the Budget this week, it feels as if political ambition has met the practical reality of sustaining long-term political direction inside institutions designed around stability and risk management. Add a “<a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2e12j4gz0o"">black hole</a>” in public finances and sporadic and often contradictory regulation, and it has rarely been harder for public servants to know what to decide — or, <em>critically</em>, how to make decisions in the first place.</p><p>Drawing on my work in early-stage policymaking at HMRC and research at UCL’s Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, this short piece of “writing as thinking” argues that the UK’s public institutions are structurally incapable of navigating uncertainty because they are built on a decision-making logic designed for predictability, control and linear planning — not for complexity, learning or adaptation. Because, if the UK is serious about missions, or<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/09/labour-promises-radical-shake-up-of-uk-civil-service""> radically</a> overhauling how the civil service thinks and works, the everyday practicalities of how decisions are framed, contested and made will need to change.</p><h3>The issue of managing uncertainty</h3><p>Across government and beyond, a lot of my work has been at the earliest stages of decision-making — where ideas are half-baked, assumptions untested, and uncertainty is at its highest. In these spaces, one of the things I see teams struggle with the most is the ability to be agile enough to experiment, learn and iterate while being stable enough to maintain direction and meet deadlines. In fact, as<a href=""https://substack.com/home/post/p-176398097?selection=9c71ba4a-9687-4262-8f6d-c025eca300e1#:~:text=The%20result%20is%20an%20innovation%20ecosystem%20that%20excels%20at%20designing%20frameworks%20but%20struggles%20to%20change%20itself""> Rainer Kattel</a> and<a href=""https://medium.com/@jamestplunkett/iterate-if-you-can-5f14b93a48cf""> James Plunkett</a> have noted, institutions are often <em>both</em> too stable and too agile — highly proficient at producing procedures and frameworks that promise control, yet poor at learning, experimenting, or re-orienting in the midst of uncertainty. The result is an all too familiar blend of paralysis, short-termism, and “<a href=""https://re-state.co.uk/publications/everythingism-an-essay/"">everythingism</a>”: needing to respond to everything while changing little.</p><p>This dynamic is not accidental. It is a lasting hangover from New Public Management — a model that has compartmentalised and hollowed out the civil service in order to make it measurable, auditable and controllable. Designed for an era of fewer citizens, slower information flows and limited data capacity, our civil service is oriented around prediction and control despite vast improvements in data, research and digital infrastructure. Put simply, we have left ourselves in a situation where we are taking 21st century challenges, evaluating them with 20th century tools, and responding within 19th century institutions built in a different time <em>and</em> for a different time.</p><p>In “Seeing Like a State”, James C Scott describes this as the state’s drive for “legibility” — making societies administratively visible by simplifying their complexity into categories that can be planned for. To illustrate this he uses the example of modern scientific forestry in Prussia. In an effort to maximise timber output, foresters cleared mixed woodlands and replanted them in perfectly straight rows of a single fast-growing species. The first generation produced higher yields, fantastic. But, by the second and third generations, yields collapsed. The drive for order — monoculture, straight lines, predictability — had unintentionally erased the complex, interdependent ecology that sustained the forest and made it viable in the first place.</p><p>New Public Management simply extends this logic into government, treating institutions as machines to be ordered rather than ecosystems to be stewarded. It rewards prediction over understanding and linear planning over iterative learning in what Funtowicz and Ravetz call a “<a href=""https://www.nusap.net/downloads/funtowiczandravetz1994.pdf"">doctrine reinforced by guesswork</a>,” reliant on cost–benefit analysis and other appraisal tools built for marginal change in predictable environments. These methods make little room for uncertainty or contested values because they flatten complexity, obscure causality and routinely miss the non-linear, cascading effects that dominate policymaking. The result is a higher<a href=""https://options2040.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/The-Radical-How.pdf""> risk of expensive failures</a>, often harming those most in need.</p><p>More fundamentally, this mode of public problem-solving is simply too slow and too distant from the people it is meant to help, offering little opportunity for learning or course correction in the first place. And, for policymaking — a forum directly concerned with people and their behaviour — it is simply not tenable to expect civil servants and ministers to predict, design and justify interventions up-front without addressing these structural constraints. Put as many<a href=""https://publicpolicydesign.blog.gov.uk/2023/02/09/what-does-policymaking-look-like/""> policy design cycles</a> in front as me as you would like, the “waterfall” model of policy delivery, illustrated in <a href=""https://public.digital/the-radical-how""><em>The Radical How</em></a>, makes this explicit. Planning happens early, implementation happens late, and evaluation tends to arrive long after the window for improvement has closed.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration depicting a waterfall policymaking process where decisions are made upfront when the least is known."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/984/0*owRgK1xqCP8gatf1.png"" /><figcaption>Waterfall policymaking — <a href=""https://public.digital/the-radical-how"">The Radical How</a></figcaption></figure><p>Recent literature on Human Learning Systems pushes this argument further, describing how this creates a “<a href=""https://www.humanlearning.systems/uploads/Public-service-for-the-new-world.pdf"">pathological culture of blame and defensiveness</a>,” within the civil service, where ambiguity is treated as error and risk is transferred onto individuals. Even when uncertainty is real and unavoidable, public officials are expected to present polished cases that imply certainty, rather than surface complexity or challenge assumptions — something I see time and time again within HMRC. What this ultimately means is that talented civil servants (of which I work with many) become trapped in an environment where they are punished for being wrong, rewarded for nothing going wrong, and rarely recognised when things go right.</p><p>This paralysis and culture of negativity isn’t individualised. I work with and have met so many talented, driven and imaginative civil servants. However, because the institutional grammar, design and hierarchy of decision-making treats uncertainty as a threat to be contained rather than a condition to be worked with, they are not given the time or space to do their best work. We have designed our organisations to reduce risk and cost under the premise of control but failed to appreciate how work actually gets done in complex systems — <a href=""https://paulcairney.wordpress.com/2025/11/06/why-dont-governments-learn-and-what-can-we-do-about-it/"">ultimately treating learning as political performance</a>.</p><blockquote><a href=""https://playingwithtime.substack.com/p/three-insights-from-a-week-of-conversations"">Recent reflections</a> from municipal leaders in China — long associated with rigid target-driven governance — note that obligatory numerical targets distort behaviour, narrow attention and create perverse incentives within institutions.</blockquote><p>Ultimately, this manifests as both a bias towards inaction and an inclination to make decisions when the least is known. Jen Pahlka memorably phrases this as “<a href=""https://www.notion.so/Unfit-for-uncertainty-Rethinking-decision-making-for-missions-2b003207924880de8466f3c32dd830ab?pvs=21"">policy vomit</a>” — in which the words of the policy are vomited, essentially undigested, into the administration of a policy, without the benefit of thoughtful, learning and iteration. In a department like HMRC, where impact is traditionally inseparable from cost, this often means using cost-benefit analysis (as suggested by the UK government’s guide to policy appraisal <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/the-green-book-and-accompanying-guidance-and-documents"">— the ‘Green Book’</a>) as a means to centre on the risk of doing something rather than the opportunity for it to go well — effectively excluding learning from the process altogether and overlooking or under-considering real-world dynamics.</p><h3>Towards managing missions or muddling through?</h3><p>Over the last decade, governments and policymakers have been increasingly turning to mission-oriented innovation as a way to break out of incrementalism and tackle the “wicked” problems causing so much trouble for our ways of working today. It signals a shift away from the narrow technocratic logic of correcting market failures towards a more ambitious role for the state in shaping and co-creating markets, mobilising collective action and directing investment towards clearly defined public purposes.</p><p>Labour’s<a href=""https://labour.org.uk/change/mission-driven-government/""> commitment to a mission-driven government</a>, not dissimilar to those across Europe as part of a broader “third generation” of innovation and policy frameworks, was meant to embody this shift — a break from short-term crisis management and a renewed focus on long-term ends. Essentially, a recognition that neoliberal and technocratic policy tools are fundamentally unsuited to steering complex socio-technical systems as they privilege efficiency, prediction and control over relevance, learning and adaptation.</p><p>There is plenty of<a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5348729""> noise on mission theory</a>. The problem, however, is that while there are many practical examples of a shift towards achieving mission policy — and more pragmatic, learning centric ways of policymaking — any meaningful practices generated by this new approach to policy have struggled to take hold.</p><p>Demos Helsinki’s “<a href=""https://demoshelsinki.fi/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Missions-for-Governance-Demos-Helsinki.pdf"">Missions for governance</a>” paper reports that a 2022 survey of more than 40 OECD countries found that only one in four mission initiatives had a clearly defined target; only 15% had a dedicated governance structure; and only one in ten had a plan for monitoring and evaluation. In other words, while governments are embracing the language of missions, they are implementing them through business-as-usual structures, inherited from New Public Management, rather than transforming the way we make decisions.</p><p>This is perhaps indicative of a larger problem of institutional change. While missions and many other forms of experimental governance look to give us a blueprint for reigniting innovation policy, they do not help shift the entrenched challenges that government faces internally. It makes me wonder — we’ve been practicing systems thinking, futures thinking and experimental forms of governance for decades (with missions as the new synthesis of some of these tools) yet regardless of how good they sound, they haven’t scaled or had the impact any of them promise because they have all failed to address these entrenched challenges (See an interesting expansion of this point <a href=""https://thesystemsthinker.com/why-few-organizations-adopt-systems-thinking/"">here</a>).</p><p>To me, this all suggests that regardless of the approach, the need for a reimagined architecture of our institutions has never been more important if we want missions to be actually transformative rather than symbolic. Missions cannot be delivered through a policymaking architecture optimised for certainty, marginal change and after-the-fact evaluation. They require a state capable of working with uncertainty rather than suppressing it — one that builds learning into the fabric of everyday decision-making, rather than treating it as an optional add-on.</p><h3>Reimagining public value must begin in the texture of everyday decisions.</h3><p>If missions are to mean anything, the civil service needs to rebuild its capacity to create public value as a practice. That requires a new grammar of decision-making: one that treats uncertainty as navigable, frames choices in terms of <em>risk and opportunity</em> rather than cost and control (See<a href=""https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/sites/bartlett/files/final_iipp_2021-03_roa_simon_sharpe_et_al_21_jan.pdf""> Simon Sharpe</a>), and builds learning into the routine choreography of how problems are defined and acted upon.</p><p>This shift depends on everyday practices, not high-level strategies: developing shared strategic alignment; negotiating problem definitions with those affected; testing ideas early; iterating in public; and learning at portfolio scale rather than programme-by-programme. These are the capabilities that make missions possible — and without them, missions will remain symbolic rather than transformative. I will write about those practices elsewhere and be sharing my MPA thesis “(Re)imagining Mission Neighbourhoods: Emerging Practices of Urban Transformation” soon.</p><p>For now, the point is simple. If the UK is serious about missions, it must first change how everyday decisions are made.</p><blockquote>This post is part of <a href=""https://civicworks.substack.com/"">CIVICWORKS</a>; a publication on (re)thinking civic bureaucracy, institutional reform, dynamic capabilities, policymaking and technology.</blockquote><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4936e04dc78a"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/unfit-for-uncertainty-rethinking-decision-making-for-missions-4936e04dc78a"">Unfit for uncertainty: Rethinking decision-making for missions</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<em>This holiday season, we’ve found the gifts that feel great to get and even better to give. Shop our collection of editor-approved holiday gift guides <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-art-of-giving"">here</a>.</em><br /><br />‘Tis the season for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-makeup-looks"">holiday parties</a>, and we’ll be remiss if you show up to these celebrations empty handed. It’s also time for visiting family (and perhaps over-staying your welcome) so it’s thoughtful to offer up some goodies as a “thank you.” Or maybe you have someone on your shopping list who just moved into a new place (or is the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/areaware-gift-guide"">self-proclaimed homebody</a> of your friend group). In any of these cases, we’ve curated a list of host and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-housewarming-gifts"">housewarming gifts</a> that’ll elevate your giftee’s spaces.<br /><br />Depending on your budget (and how generous you’re feeling this holiday season), this guide features a range of products between $20 and $200. For homebodies, consider luxe Quince robes, artsy Piecework puzzles, and eclectic Fellow tea kettles. For the new resident, opt for a smart Hatch alarm clock, viral Anthropologie glassware, and cozy Outdoor Fellow candles. And for the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hosting-friends-at-home-socializing"">holiday party host</a>, you can cart up olive oil dipping sets, unsuspecting board games, non-alcoholic drinks. <br /><br />And maybe it’s no surprise that a majority of these gifts deal with gathering around the table — from Le Creuset mini cocottes and Lenox cream and sugar sets to Caraway bar accessories and BonBon candy boxes — because food is universally the way to the heart. (Be sure to also check out our related gift guides, like for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-luxury-gifts-under-50"">luxury gifts under $50</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gifts-for-woman-who-wants-nothing"">for the woman who wants nothing</a>, for suggestions on more home décor and cooking gifts!)<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

<p>It’s a Sunday afternoon. I’m sitting in a quiet Queens cafe, stirring my coffee across from the man I love when he says, calmly and rehearsed, <em>“I’ve never truly loved you. And I don’t think I ever will.”</em></p>



<p><em>Ouch. </em>Safe to say, blueberry pancakes will never taste the same again. </p>



<p>What followed was every <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2019/11/8894605/stages-of-breakup"">stage of heartbreak</a> you can imagine. Remorse, regret, rumination. I was moving through the world carrying the weight of loving someone who, if I’m being honest, didn’t even like me most days. Crying on the subway became a routine and <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/0l8zYqoUeBYg47Gmevq9HZ?si=zWdALid9QeaRFRvp2IB-JQ"">Olivia Dean’s <em>The Art of Loving</em></a> became my lifeline. </p>



<p>Just when I thought the world had shrunk to the size of my grief, life threw me a bone — a random, unexpected invitation to Club Med in the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dominican-republic-adventures"">Dominican Republic.</a> I didn’t know it yet, but this was the plot twist my heart so desperately needed.</p>



<p>A few days later, I was on a plane to the DR with five nights ahead at the all-inclusive <a href=""https://www.clubmed.us/r/punta-cana/y?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=SEA_BR_ALL_Google_US_EN_Multi-Product_LH_Multi-resort&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=19311535181&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD5uxODXrDAIWhxBxghEmlVF6ni1O&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAlrXJBhBAEiwA-5pgwp8yNRnmlZJS6fLh022jduivzrsivPRIKjdz7kmlzNfD-LCZ53IUUBoCK8AQAvD_BwE"">Club Med Punta Cana</a> and <a href=""http://utm_source"">Club Med Michès</a>. I’d never been to the Dominican, but after hours of Googling, I was convinced I’d found the perfect escape. After all, nothing heals a heartbreak faster than an open bar, right?<br /><br />Not quite.</p>



<p>To no one’s surprise, I spent the first few nights at the resort broken. As Black women, we don’t always feel held in our relationships. The breakup felt like a generational curse. Most days, I felt like I was screaming into the void to be truly seen, accepting half-hearted apologies, and enduring comments meant to make me feel small. Somebody call Madea and tell her to get <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@jellydivinti/video/7258625800293862699?lang=en"">the grits ready!</a></p>



<p>Then it clicked. Black women deserve luxury. We deserve softness. And dammit, we deserve an all-inclusive resort! So, I would become my ancestors’ wildest dreams. I was going to have a love story worth writing, even if the prince charming was me. </p>



<p>So the next day, I dragged myself out of bed, threw on my swimsuit, and decided I was going to become the best boyfriend I ever had.</p>



<p><strong>Spa Time: Luxury Lifts The Soul</strong></p>



<p>My first few days were spent at<a href=""https://www.clubmed.us/r/punta-cana/y""> Club Med Spa: Punta Cana</a>, where I discovered just how much luxury can lift the soul. Mornings started with an Aperol Spritz overlooking the Atlantic from the Buena Vista Lounge. The sun wrapped around me, giving me the warmth I’d been craving for weeks. The lounge also offered a buffet selection from every corner of the globe, Italian, Asian, Mediterranean, you name it. And did I mention I’m an emotional eater? I shut that buffet down.</p>



<p>Every evening, I attended one of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMiH_bZIpfN/"">Club Med’s classic parties</a>. Their iconic all-white party gave me the perfect excuse to put on heels and feel like myself again. Live bands and circus shows pulled me out of my head and I ended up meeting women who spanned across multiple generations each sharing their own chaotic stories about men. And suddenly, I didn’t feel so alone. </p>

<p><strong>Self-care As The Ultimate Breakup Cure</strong></p>



<p>Of course, the self-care didn’t stop there. I dove into<a href=""https://www.clubmed.us/l/wellness-fusion""> Club Med’s Wellness Fusion program</a>, attending yoga classes and guided meditation led by resident experts. I realized reclaiming my peace of mind wasn’t just about escaping heartbreak. It was about actively choosing to nurture myself in every way possible.</p>



<p>The last couple of days were spent at <a href=""https://www.clubmed.us/r/miches-playa-esmeralda/y?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=SEA_BR_ALL_Google_US_EN_Multi-Product_LH_Multi-resort&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=19311535181&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD5uxODXrDAIWhxBxghEmlVF6ni1O&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAlrXJBhBAEiwA-5pgwleHQUK6O-JvQBLBM1YN1ErnyPfAbI4camT0OkMvB9I0XW5SrRTL5RoCZNAQAvD_BwE"">Club Med Michès</a>, and let me tell you, this resort was a dream. The two resorts aren’t close to each other, Michès is about a two-hour drive east, tucked away in the El Seibo province, surrounded by lush palm groves, rugged mountains, and secluded beaches. The property stretches across 93 acres, offering everything from treetop yoga to Zen pools, making it feel like its own private world.</p>



<p>The buffet at Michès felt gourmet and fresh and I happily sampled everything, for research purposes, of course. </p>



<p><strong>Dancing It Out &amp; Letting The Sun Set On Heartbreak</strong></p>



<p>And then there was Miches’ all-white party. I drank with new friends from all over the globe, screamed <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kffacxfA7G4"">Justin Bieber’s “Baby”</a> at the top of my lungs. It was a moment of pure, chaotic joy and a reminder of how big the world really is.</p>



<p>And last but not least, the beach. This was my favorite part. The sun danced across the turquoise waves and to no one’s surprise, I cried. Not from sadness, but appreciation for being alive. To be able to love and to feel. Honestly, I could have stayed there forever. </p>



<p>With sunsets on horseback, spa treatments, and yoga flows as part of Club Med’s Wellness Fusion program, I realized Michès wasn’t just a vacation, it was a masterclass in reclaiming peace, indulgence, and joy.</p>

<p>Listen, men suck. And they have since the beginning of time. The trip didn’t completely erase my heartbreak, but it reminded me there’s so much more to life than one person’s opinion. There’s joy, connection, and peace waiting to be found. You don’t need an all-inclusive resort to heal, but sometimes it helps to step away, tend to your spirit, and let the world slow down. As I continue this journey of self-discovery, I hope to carry this sense of wonder and ease wherever I go.</p>

<p>As a major fan of the original <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/05/110716/best-fresh-prince-of-bel-air-episodes""><em>The Fresh Prince of Bel Air</em></a>, I was hesitant but eager to see what its <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/07/11752424/adrian-holmes-bel-air-season-3-uncle-phil-interview"">reboot <em>Bel Air</em> </a>would bring to the characters I hold very dear to my heart. In 2022 when the show premiered, I loved it instantly. Recently, we’ve seen so many reboots come and go, but <a href=""https://www.peacocktv.com/stream-tv/bel-air"">Peacock’s <em>Bel Air</em></a><em> </em>has succeeded where others have failed . By taking a beloved 30-minute sitcom and turning it into a compelling &amp; layered one-hour drama, <em>Bel-Air</em> brought something fresh and exciting to the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/02/10874708/bel-air-carlton-fresh-prince-reboot-backlash""><em>Fresh Prince </em>franchise</a>. The storylines and character arcs were so detailed and nuanced that it felt similar but brand new. While the show is indeed a drama that gets the heart pumping — looking at you, Geoffrey — it still has the warm feeling of a family truly showing what it means to show up for one another. For three seasons, I’ve laughed and even cried while watching <em>Bel Air</em>, and trust me, Season 4 will continue to take us on a rollercoaster of emotions. I was heartbroken when it was announced that this would be<em> Bel-Air’s</em> last season, </p>



<p>What started as a concept on YouTube <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAfJpyBgcgA"">six years ago by Morgan Cooper</a> has since flourished into Peacock’s longest running <em>and</em> most streamed original series. The execution of this show from start to finish is a testament to Black ingenuity and a reminder that art is for <em>all</em> of us. As <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/cassiedamsel/"">Cassandra Freeman</a>, who plays Aunt Viv told me over Zoom, “Your vision is not trite, it is worthy.” She continued: “The greatest artistic expression is [that] you were born to change other people’s lives with your vision..” A word.</p>



<p>Ahead of the <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@peacock/video/7576291076558851341"">Season 4 premiere</a>, I was able to share some laughs and get insight from <em>Bel-Air’s</em> cast on how they feel about the series’ final season, the growth of  their characters,  and the legacy they think <em>Bel Air </em>will leave.</p>



<p><strong>Refinery29: Congrats on the final season!  How do you feel about the growth of your characters over four seasons?</strong></p>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/02/10869393/coco-jones-bel-air-hilary-colorism""><strong>Coco Jones</strong></a><strong> (Hilary Banks): </strong>I feel pretty satisfied with my growth. I think that Hilary started off [more] surface.  She’s this influencer, this cute girl with sickening outfits. It was very lighthearted at the beginning and then you get to unravel the plights that she goes through and it’s real life. [Now, she’s] feeling like she doesn’t have a seat at the table and wanting to be the chef and people wanting to downplay her recipes, like they’re too spicy. This girl comes from this zip code, this net worth, but it didn’t buy her this easy life. It doesn’t buy her self-discovery. She still has to go through the highs and lows to figure out who she is. I’ve enjoyed really playing her, her arcs and her peaks and valleys.</p>



<p><strong>Akira Akbar (Ashley Banks):</strong> I feel really satisfied with Ashley’s growth among these seasons. We really got to see a teenage girl and what she goes through. When I was a younger teenager, I fully didn’t know who I was. I was still trying to figure out myself. I was exactly like Ashley. I think the writers really did a great job of portraying that on screen.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11947337.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>BEL-AIR — “Soulmates” Episode 407 — Pictured: (l-r) Akira Akbar as Ashley, Coco Jones as Hilary — (Photo by: Anne Marie Fox/PEACOCK)</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Cassandra Freeman (Aunt Viv):</strong> [Viv] started off as a politician’s wife, and by the end of this, she becomes a self-expressed artist. It’s been an amazing journey to play her. She’s trying to figure out how to speak her truth and take care of other people and [she] realizes the best way to take care of other people is to take care of yourself first. Take care of your passions first. Tell people the truth first. It’s been an honor to play her storyline.</p>



<p><strong>Olly Sholotan (Carlton Banks):</strong> I’ve never been happier. I think that the beautiful thing that these writers have done is they’ve taken such good care of our characters’ journeys, and I just know that by the time you get to the very end, fans are gonna be so proud of Carlton’s growth.</p>



<p><strong>Jabari Banks (Will Smith):</strong> I was gonna say proud. Proud of the people that our characters have become. Proud of their journeys and proud of where they’re going next. </p>



<p><strong>Jimmy Akingbola (Geoffrey Thompson):</strong>  We started very gentle with Geoffrey. It was a lot of sitting in a mystery and not resting on the wave of nostalgia. I’m an actor that loves to get my hands dirty. [I’ll roll] up my sleeves, gimme the ball, let me play. So I was very happy when we got into Season 3, where we got to see behind the layers of Geoffrey. I think Season 4 is the perfect way to sort of wrap things up because again, his past comes through the door. My key word for this season for Geoffrey is fracture. He fractures everything that he built with the Banks family. And I think it teaches you that there are consequences to every action you do in life. And this is the first time that Geoffrey is not in control… He’s under pressure. </p>



<p><strong>Jordan L. Jones (Jazz):</strong> Just the growth of my character in general has just been a blessing because when we first get the roles, it’s like you’re just cool with whatever. I’m playing Jazz. I’m not a part of the family, but my character has layers and layers and layers and layers. Coming up to Season 4, I think one of the main themes is about Jazz’s evolution [and] unconditional love. And just being strong enough to tell your significant other, or the person that you love, how you actually feel no matter what the circumstances are. As men too, we need to do that more often instead of trying to be hard all the time. That’s one thing that my character definitely has taught me. Some of the things that sound weak or feel weak or seem like what you shouldn’t do, [aren’t like that at all]. It feels like don’t express your feelings this way, but no, actually, instead of thinking <em>that’s weak</em>, I think that it actually takes a very strong person to do that.</p>



<p><strong>Adrian Holmes [Uncle Phil]:</strong> Philip Banks started out being that pillar for the family and over time, we start to see cracks in that pillar and just how  life has weighed on him and the pressures of being perfect. I think that the theme for him is legacy and building legacy is not what we leave behind for the next generation. It’s what we leave within the next generation — the impact, the lives we change, you know. I think that Philip has done a great job over the arc of this series in just empowering Will, empowering Carlton, and the family, and just letting them know that they are enough and they have all the tools they need and just really building them up to be the best versions of themselves. Also just embracing the simple things in life and inner peace. I think he’s just been so busy outside, looking outside that he hasn’t been able to really focus on the inside and over the time where we see him in this season, he starts to really look within more and appreciate the little things.</p>



<p><strong>What mark or message do you think<em> Bel Air </em></strong><strong>will leave once it is over?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Coco: </strong>If I had to say it would be to stay close to the people who love you back. You know, at the end of the day, they will be your support system. And you can have great accomplishments, but don’t forget the people who love you back and who really, truly know you because there’s always seasons and things change. And you wanna have the people that will always support you as close to you as possible.</p>



<p><strong>Cassandra: </strong> Titles change, positions fade, great successes get forgotten. But family is why they say charity starts at home.That’s the first one. And then the second thing is outside of the show, just the birth of it. I hope people realize if you have a great idea, you too can be Morgan Cooper and drop your thesis for an idea on YouTube. And your platform is how many people agree with you. And you not only will change your life, you’ll change everyone else’s life. That’s the greatest artistic expression. You were born to change other people’s lives with your vision. Your vision is not trite, it is worthy. </p>



<p>​​<strong>Akira:</strong> I think the biggest takeaway from <em>Bel Air</em> is family over everything. You can have all the friends in the world. They can come and go, but your family is always there</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11947339.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>BEL-AIR — “The Maybes” Episode 401 — Pictured: (l-r) Adrian Holmes as Philip, Cassandra Freeman as Vivian — (Photo by: Anne Marie Fox/PEACOCK)</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Simone Jones:</strong> I feel like it’s the ability to reinvent yourself and love yourself while you do it. And, also to really take care of your community because we’re gonna mess up. I feel like relationships now have become very temporary and very fragile. And so to watch,even just as a cast, we go through like our teens together in LA and something you’ve never seen before, and watching these characters kind of mirror a similar turbulent time. I think I want people to leave with, like, your community is really important to yourself and also everybody else.</p>



<p><strong>Olly:</strong> Man, Simone really took the words just kind of right outta my mouth. So everything she said, but put it in a slightly deeper voice.</p>



<p><strong>Jabari:</strong> She said something that  really stuck me there too. The reinvention, uh, you know, reinvention and, not being afraid to reinvent yourself. Not being afraid to reinvent in general. You know we’ve shown the world that just ’cause you know, you reinvent something doesn’t mean that it has to be corny or it doesn’t mean that it has to, you know what I’m saying? It can be a totally different thing, you know?  We are the living proof of that. </p>



<p><strong>Jordan:</strong>  I think for me, I think for our theme has been constant throughout four seasons, where like we’re just showing, all aspects of the Black experience. What I love about our show is that each one of our characters is going through a different black experience. We got me like the hustler. That’s like, I’m not broke, but I ain’t, I ain’t Uncle Phil, you know? Uncle Phil’s like the leader of the household. And then we, then we got Geoffery, who’s black 007. We got Will fish outta water. We got Carlton, who is very privileged. So it’s like I can, I can go down the line, but we’re showing that the black experience, </p>



<p><strong>Adrian:</strong> We’re not a monolith.</p>



<p><strong>Jordan:</strong> The black experience is not just one experience, like, come over here we’re black this is what we do. It’s not like that, you know? </p>



<p><strong>Adrian: </strong>Absolutely. We’re not defined by our trauma or our struggle.  You know, our joy is something to be celebrated. Our joy is our superpower. It’s our fuel, and that’s what keeps us resilient. I always say, we can bend, but don’t break. Our black joy is what prevents us from, from breaking and always surviving no matter how difficult the situations are. The issue is we always find a way to prevail. Our show, Bel Air has done a fantastic job of really showcasing that, you know?. We’re not a monolith. We are redefining what the black experience looks like on television.We need more of that narrative moving forward.  And hopefully there’s not a huge void after our show. </p>



<p><strong>All right, we’re going to end on a game called Bothered or Unbothered. I’m gonna throw you some rapid-fires questions and your answer is either Bothered or Unbothered. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Keeping family secrets. Bothered or Unbothered?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Coco:</strong> Hmm. Bothered. I [like to] get everything out in the open. I really love therapy and I can’t with a secret. It’s like mold. It’s just going to get everywhere.  Plus, I can’t remember everything I done said. Now I gotta keep up with the lies. I don’t know what I just said to you.</p>



<p><strong>Cassandra:</strong> I’m kind of unbothered because I’m starting to realize that if I am interested in what you’re cooking up all the time and in your pot, it just steals my joy. You can live your whole life knowing everybody’s secrets and never even deal with your own. So if it’s my secrets, I’m bothered. I’m gonna get it out. If it ain’t bothering me in my house, listen, you go over there. I ain’t got time for that. It’s too much, I’m unbothered.  </p>



<p><strong>Akira:</strong> My secret, I feel like I’ll be bothered and I’ll be like, I need to tell somebody, but someone else’s I don’t care.</p>



<p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Unbothered by that.</p>



<p><strong>Jimmy:</strong> Unbothered!</p>



<p><strong>Adrian:</strong> Unbothered.</p>



<p><strong>Jordan: </strong>Everybody don’t have to know what your family is going through.</p>



<p><strong>Jabari:</strong> It depends on the secret.</p>



<p><strong>Olly:</strong> Yeah. Like keeping family [secrets] in the family? Bothered. But I’m OK with keeping family secrets from outside people. I ain’t trying to tell our business. </p>



<p><strong>Jabari:</strong> Sometimes you gotta keep a little secret. Sometimes you have to. It’s best for the family. Mom don’t need to know that. Mom don’t need to know what Cuzzo did when we went out. Mom don’t need to know that. Keep it secret.</p>



<p><strong>Olly:</strong> I think what’s in the dark will always come to the light, so I don’t know about this one.</p>



<p><strong>Simone:</strong> Oh no. I feel I’m a big fan of everybody having all the information and then doing what you will with it.</p>

<p>As a beauty director for 10 years, I’ve tried enough <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charlotte-tilbury-exaggereyes-mascara-review"">Charlotte Tilbury products</a> to conclude that if all makeup production stopped and it were the only brand left, I’d be perfectly happy. I’m not the only one — my beauty editor peers and fellow R29 staffers praise the brand for its inclusive <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charlotte-tilbury-unreal-skin-sheer-glow-tint-review"">foundation shades</a> and campaigns featuring people of all skin tones and ages, Instagram-worthy packaging, dreamy textures, top-notch quality, and that you’re never left wanting. From blush to skincare and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charlotte-tilbury-perfume-fragrance-collection-of-emotions"">even fragrance</a>, there isn’t a product that Charlotte Tilbury hasn’t put her name on.</p>



<p>But with so many in the range, how do you know which ones are worth your hard-earned money? Luckily, I’ve been wearing a full face of Charlotte Tilbury for months, putting everything through its paces at weddings, during workouts, and at work. Here’s everything I’d recommend if you’re looking to expand your makeup collection.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>

<p>So many brands use the word “airbrush” to describe their products, but few actually live up to the hype. <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fairbrush-flawless-foundation-shade-4-neutral"">This one does</a>. I vividly remember applying it for the first time and being blown away by how well it blurred my large pores, hid leftover acne marks, and minimized my dark circles — and that was just one pump. It’s so packed with pigment that one pump is really all you need to cover your entire face. <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fbeautiful-skin-foundation-2-neutral"">Unlike Charlotte’s Beautiful Skin Foundation</a>, which has a dewy finish, this one is matte, but it eliminates the need for powder. I’m always impressed by how well it lasts without sliding off or settling into creases, and even with its impressive staying power, it still feels comfortable and skin-like. That’s thanks to the clever “Aircool” technology, which the brand says helps it withstand sweat and humidity. Even better, it’s non-comedogenic, so it’s unlikely to cause breakouts. Here, I’m wearing shade 5 Cool, but there are 44 shades to choose from.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fairbrush-flawless-setting-spray"">Charlotte Tilbury Airbrush Flawless Setting Spray, $38</a></h2>

<p>As you can tell, I use this setting spray religiously. Even on days when I’m just wearing a tap of blush and a tinted moisturizer, it keeps everything in place for so much longer — and I’m constantly touching my face. Other setting sprays make my face and brows feel rock-hard, like my skin might crack, but not this one. It lets your face move and doesn’t leave behind any chalky residue. I also love that the nozzle is wide, so it covers your whole face in one or two spritzes — no waiting around for droplets to dry. It keeps my makeup looking and feeling fresh all day, but if you have very oily skin, you might prefer upgrading to the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fmini-airbrush-flawless-matte-setting-spray"">Airbrush Flawless Setting Spray Matte</a>.</p>

<p>This is the only matte lipstick that doesn’t leave my lips parched — and trust me, I’ve tried my fair share. Instead, it’s comfortably creamy without skimping on pigment. One swipe on my bottom lip, then pressing my lips together, is enough for me. The square-shaped bullet makes application so crisp and precise you could skip lip liner altogether. The nude shades don’t last as long as the bolder reds, obviously, but they still hold up surprisingly well. I can drink multiple cups of tea, eat a full meal, and still find it hanging on. Here, I’m wearing <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fmatte-revolution-lipstick-pillowtalk"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pillow Talk Original</a>, but the Pillow Talk collection is also available in shades Medium, Deep, and Fair. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Flip-cheat-pillowtalk"">Charlotte Tilbury Lip Cheat, $26</a></h2>

<p>This might be one of the pricier lip pencils out there, but I can honestly say it’s the best. I’ve never known one to last as long as this does. Often, my lipstick disappears by the end of the day, but the ghost of this liner is still visible. I love that the texture is equal parts creamy and waxy — you can blur it with your fingers, yet it won’t budge once you’re done.</p>

<p>This is the best mascara in Charlotte Tilbury’s collection, easily trumping <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fpillow-talk-push-up-lashes-mascara"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pillow Talk Push Up Lashes</a> and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Flegendary-lashes-vol2-volumising-mascara"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Legendary Lashes</a>. It’s all thanks to the exceptionally large, curved brush, which beefs up even the tiniest lashes in the inner and outer corners. Though it’s bigger than your average brush, it’s surprisingly easy to maneuver. I’m always pleasantly surprised by how much volume I get from just one coat, and I’ve never received so many compliments. Even better, it doesn’t smudge or run — and I have very oily skin, so that’s usually a given for me. And when it’s time to take it off, it melts away with a cream cleanser. No scrubbing required.</p>

<p>While there are a handful of palettes in Charlotte’s collection, I’m not exactly a dab hand with eyeshadow — but this quad makes building an eye look from scratch ridiculously easy. In fact, it’s the palette Charlotte’s bridal makeup artists always reach for because it’s so foolproof. Two mattes, one shimmer, and one extra-metallic shade make up the foursome, and each quad (there are 16 of them, by the way) is color-coded so you don’t have to stress about what goes with what. Want a smoky eye? Sweep the darkest shade through your crease and tap the metallic shade onto the center of your lid. I like using my fingers for the shimmers and metallics, and every shade blends together beautifully. It’s my go-to for nights out and weddings.</p>

<p>Allow me to introduce you to my favorite blush right now — it’s been in my makeup bag since it launched earlier this year. This stick makes application effortless thanks to its ultra-creamy base (a dream to blend) and buildable pigment. A couple of swipes bring my light olive skin to life, giving it a rosy sheen with ultra-fine shimmer flecks. It really does make your skin look like it’s glowing from the inside out. Some days, I even skip foundation and tap this onto my cheekbones and nose to pep up my complexion. Since it’s a cream, the staying power isn’t as long as Charlotte’s powder blushes, but it’s simple to top up on the go with your fingers. Here, I’m wearing <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Funreal-blush-stick-pinky-glow"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pinky Glow</a>, but it’s available in five more shades to suit all skin tones.</p>

<p>This unassuming eyeshadow pot is my secret weapon for creating a compliment-worthy eye look in seconds. The cream-to-powder formula is like an oyster shell of metallics and shimmers that catch the light from every angle, giving the effect of a painstaking, multi-step eyeshadow routine. I just swipe it on with my ring finger and blend the edges with a soft brush. It grips even my oily eyelids without creasing or separating — and a little goes a very long way. Here, I’m wearing <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Feyes-to-mesmerise-rose-gold"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Rose Gold</a>, but there are nine others to choose from.</p>

<p>I love the thin doe-foot applicator on this concealer — you can be really precise with placement rather than wiping out your features by going overboard. I have dry under-eyes, but this feels nicely moisturizing, which means it’s far less likely to settle obviously into fine lines and accentuate them. It also has brightening powers thanks to tiny, natural mica-based pearls that disperse across the skin and act like a built-in ring light for dark circles. And it’s not just a concealer: hydrating niacinamide and hyaluronic acid, skin-strengthening peptides, and antioxidant vitamin C make it basically skincare in disguise.</p>

<p>I’m not usually a fan of plumping glosses, but this one is built differently. First off, it doesn’t make my lips feel like they’re on fire. Instead, it has a cooling effect thanks to methyl diisopropyl propionamide, which I’m sure gets my blood pumping to the surface. If that doesn’t give your lips a lift, the light-reflecting pigments will. Like crushed diamonds, they create a 3D effect, giving the illusion of fuller, rounder lips. On top of that, it feels more like a comfortable lip oil than a sticky, hair-trapping gloss, so I actually want to keep applying it. A Charlotte Tilbury makeup artist recommended lining my lips, applying Pillow Talk lipstick, and then slicking this on top for a wedding-ready look.</p>

<p>This is one of the few pressed powders I’ve tried that genuinely feels like you’re not wearing anything. Many leave skin chalky or exaggerate texture, but this one gives just the right level of matte, taking down shine without making skin look flat. Plus, it lasts <em>forever</em>. </p>

<p>I much prefer Charlotte’s Glowgasm wands — essentially highlighter-blush hybrids — over the matte blushes because they add dimension and make my makeup look effortless, like I haven’t even tried. I always reach for Pinkgasm, though there are several shades to suit all skin tones. That gorgeous glow you see all over the brand’s Instagram? It’s almost always thanks to these. The formula melts into the skin, and the shimmer looks like a natural gloss rather than chunky glitter. Just make sure to twist the cap to “off” when closing the applicator, or be prepared for a messy spill.</p>

<p>I was gutted to hear that the brand’s Airbrush Bronzer is being discontinued, but this is the next best thing — and I think it lasts even longer on the skin than powder bronzers. One dot is all I need to define my cheekbones and add warmth to my complexion, and unlike other cream bronzers, it never looks muddy or gets stuck in my hairline. It blends effortlessly thanks to moisturizing ingredients like glycerin and skin-smoothing dimethicone. Again, be sure to turn the cap to “off” before putting it back inside your makeup bag.</p>

<p>Brow Lift is a bit too chunky for my liking, but <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fbrow-cheat-eyebrow-pencil-natural-brown"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Brow Cheat</a> is just right. The angled nib is smaller, letting you mimic fine brow hairs, and the pencil is creamy enough to fill in sparse patches quickly. It never fades or smudges on me, and I love the spoolie on the end for feathering out the pigment and creating natural-looking brows. I’ll admit, I’m not the biggest fan of the brand’s ultra-thin Brow Fix brow gel for my wiry brows — but if your brow hairs are finer, you’ll probably love it, as it’s totally inconspicuous.</p>

<p>Move over, Victoria Beckham Beauty. This is, in my opinion, the best eyeliner pencil out there right now. It’s creamy enough to create a smudgy, smoky eye, yet long-lasting enough for a sharp, block-winged look. I trick I’ve learned is to use the edge of my nail to sharpen things up, and I’m always so impressed with how well it lasts at the end of a night out.</p>

<p>I recently replaced all my tired, scratchy makeup brushes with <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fthe-complete-brush-set"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Charlotte Tilbury’s complete set</a>, and I won’t go back. I’ve never used brushes this soft, but don’t underestimate them. They’re plush and dense, making blending cream and powder products an absolute dream. My most-used brush is the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fhollywood-complexion-contour-brush"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Complexion Brush</a>, which I reach for with foundation, blush, and concealer.

<p>There are several reasons why finding the right dry shampoo is a tricky feat. For starters, it’s not guaranteed that it will actually help your hair feel cleaner and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/greasy-oily-hair-after-washing"">absorb excess oil </a>— and that’s not even taking into consideration whether or not it’ll leave a chalky cast in its wake. And if there’s one person who feels uniquely primed to put the stuff through its paces, it’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/chloe-kim-snowboarder-mental-health-interview"">Chloe Kim</a>.</p>



<p>The Olympic snowboarder — who the world met in the 2018 Winter Games as a bleached blonde — has recently returned to her brunette roots. Given that her job requires more time in a snug, sweat-trapping helmet than the average person, when she says she swears by Batiste to keep her roots feeling and looking fresh, I — a fellow dark brunette — am inclined to believe her.</p>



<p>“I remember using Batiste for the first time and being like, <em>oh my gosh, this works</em>,” she tells Refinery29, days before going to intensive training ahead of the upcoming 2026 Olympics in Italy. “Especially with my travel and training, it’s one of those necessities that I need on the go.” Her favorite formula? The <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/zen-matcha-light-dry-shampoo-pimprod2049243?sku=2633384"">Zen Matcha Light Dry Shampoo</a>, which uses rice starch to mop up excess oil and has a refreshing chamomile, green tea, and sandalwood scent.</p>

<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>On her favorite skincare of the moment </h2>



<p>“My skincare routine these days consists of Medicube,” Kim tells me — and it makes total sense considering the brand’s toner pads have become a cult staple among K-beauty obsessives and R29 staffers alike. “I love their toner pads and face masks, especially the collagen masks,” adds Kim.  For her, that reliability becomes essential when she’s travelling: “When I’m on the road, especially for snowboarding, where I’m in very dry climates, it’s all about moisturize, moisturize, moisturize.” We love <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/collagen-niacinamide-jelly-cream-pimprod2053650?sku=2645369"">Medicube’s Collagen Niacinamide Jelly Cream</a> for its glass skin-bestowing ingredients like collagen, squalane, and niacinamide.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>On returning to her brunette roots</h2>



<p>While Kim might be known for her incredible hair today, the journey getting there wasn’t exactly smooth sailing. “Bleaching was rough for my hair, I’m not going to lie. I had to chop it when it was bleached, which was sad, but when I went back to brunette, I was able to grow it out, and I started caring more about my hair when I saw that it was growing back very healthy.” Kim says that it’s about having a consistent routine, but mainly, taking care of your scalp. “My scalp was always so oily and congested, and I would wash it all the time. And then that’s when I discovered Batiste dry shampoo,” she says. The <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/zen-matcha-light-dry-shampoo-pimprod2049243?sku=2633384"">Zen Matcha Light Dry Shampoo</a> buys you more time between washes — ideal if you’re as busy as Kim — thanks to oil-absorbing rice starch. It’s also packed with moisturizing glycerin and calming plant extracts to keep your scalp healthy and comfortable.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>On her Olympics hair routine</h2>



<p>Kim’s secret to excellent hair is practice — and then some. “Honestly, it’s like muscle memory at this point. I just know where to pull from,” she says of her accidentally perfect strands. “I will say when I sleep with heatless curls in, I get a really cute wave. So when I pull my strands out, they’re perfect.” To make the most of your beauty sleep, try <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/satin-heatless-curling-set-pimprod2031918?sku=2592934"">Kitsch’s Satin Heatless Curling Set</a>, which cuts down on frizz and breakage while delivering bouncy, defined ringlets.</p>



<p>Kim laughs as she thinks back to her early snowboarding days, when bigger always felt better. “I used to like [my waves] really thick,” she adds, “so I’d pull out a pretty big chunk, but then it started obstructing my vision when I was doing tricks, so I had to tone it back a bit.”</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>On her experimenting with beauty</h2>



<p>Looking back on her beauty routine throughout the years, Kim — whose signature look is a matte nude lip and feathered brows — says she’s switched things up so many times. “I got into makeup when I was young, and then hair came shortly after. I wanted to dye it all these crazy colors and do all of that fun stuff — I’m all about it. When I first started doing makeup, I always had to have eyeliner, usually a little wing. I also loved mascara and got into BB cushions too.” (One of her go-to’s is the <a href=""https://global.oliveyoung.com/product/detail?prdtNo=GA230518794"">Laneige Neo Cushion</a>, which packs hydrating properties and sheer coverage in a light-as-air formula].</p>

<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/december-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">December opens</a> a prophetic window for us. It is a transitional pause and an opportunity to integrate all the lessons we’ve gathered throughout the year and lock it in before moving onto the new year portal. Here we get to rest, recalibrate our energies, and focus on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-zodiac-sign-2025"">setting intentions</a> for the new year. It is a moment between endings and beginnings, and if we are silent enough, we can hear Spirit’s whispers on what’s next. <br /><br />This month’s tarotscopes reveal the frequency you’ll be walking into in 2026: the blessings you’ve earned, the lessons that are wrapping up, and the energy that will define your next chapter. You are always the energetic architect of your present and future. Now allow these tarotscopes to guide you toward alignment. <figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946629.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Capricorn: 3 of Pentacles <br /></h2></strong><br />It’s time to level up your foundation and your standard in every area of your life. If 2025 has taught you anything, it’s that you deserve it all, but you have to embody it and start making choices that reflect that reality. Review your foundations in all areas of your life: spirituality, health, relationships, finances, career, beauty, and more. Evaluate what worked versus what didn’t, and what is the next level for you in these areas of your life. You’re no stranger to effective work and dedication. Everything that you’ve been applying yourself in 2025 will blossom in 2026. The 3 of Pentacles reminds you that collaboration is your currency, so don’t hesitate to ask for help or resources. You don’t have to do a whole rehaul of your life alone. Let Source do the heavy lifting for you and bring you the right people, places, and opportunities. Let your excellence be seen. This is your year to master your craft and be rewarded for it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946624.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Aquarius: 2 of Wands<br /></h2></strong><br />This is your year to push your limits in terms of being seen and allowing your brilliance and genius to shine. The coming year will encourage you to expand in every area of your life; you must be fearless and confident with your momentum. In 2026, you will find yourself in new territory that requires a more regulated nervous system. You are worthy and capable of having and maintaining all of your desires. Nothing you encounter will be familiar, but it will be elevated. Your task is to not fall back into old patterns. Instead, decide and commit that you will raise your vibration as the new standard. It is time to move differently because you’ve outgrown so much in your life and you’re now ready for what you deserve. The world is literally opening up for you, and now is the time that you take advantage of all the inner work and effort you’ve done. It is all up to you. You get to choose your path and adventure.  </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946633.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Pisces: 3 of Swords</h2></strong><strong><br /></strong>The new year requires that you continue to release and cleanse from inside out. It is the karmic release that brings sweet blessings and makes space for the life you truly deserve to live, but it cannot pour in if you are subconsciously or even consciously still holding on to energies that you’ve inherited ancestrally or baggage that weighs you down. What is being cleared from your life will free you to focus on your purpose and projects that have been brought to your attention. This is purification, not punishment. Cut emotional cords and ties to old stories, people, places, past lives, habits, and even obligations that you’ve outgrown. Update your life with immense clarity. You know what you don’t want, and this can help give you insight on what you do. Focus on that and fine-tune the details on what that looks and feels like in every area. Don’t bind yourself to things that no longer bring pleasure or require labor in a way that doesn’t expand you. Update the way you do things and the way you frame your life. You must live your truth by all means necessary.  </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946627.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Aries: King of Swords<br /></h2></strong><br />This is the year of implementing a great strategy and upgrading your education and knowledge. Investing in yourself will be key to your growth and success. This coming year calls for clarity, precision, and mastery over your mind. Your words will carry profound weight, so this is the time to speak things into existence or create a journal practice where you can script things into existence or release emotions through the process. If you’ve failed to advocate for yourself, you will be bolder, sharper, more direct, clearer, and confident when negotiating in all areas of your life and discerning what you truly deserve versus what is being presented to you. Do not settle. Honesty is key this year. It’s best to stick to what you have decided to commit to and not stray off the path. In 2026, you will not be reactive but responding from your power and ability to see into the future. Refine your voice and leadership abilities. Trust that you know what is best for you, and the world will follow your direction. Leave the ego behind and leverage your superpowers. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946636.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Taurus: Queen of Wands<br /></h2></strong><br />This is a year of radical independence, sexual energy, and potent power. The Queen of Wands is your reminder that confidence <em>is</em> a currency and the more you flaunt it, the more your desires will gravitate to you. This is an unstoppable time when your spirit is finally aligned with an elevated identity. There’s nothing that you cannot have, be, or do. Your magnetism and charm require that you delegate and make your life simple, so that the “work” you do is more easeful and impactful. Stop playing small with your gifts and allow your free spirit to lead. You no longer need permission to be the fullest version of yourself. In this timeline, you are safe and abundant — trust that. Expect radical expansion in your business or career, finances, sex life, confidence, spiritual journey, and femininity. You will inspire many others to take up space.  </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946630.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Gemini: Page of Swords<br /></h2></strong><br />This is the year you invoke more curiosity and play. You will be reinventing yourself in ways that will shock others. Your ingenuity and ability to not only adapt to the time but shift it for the better is memorable and will forever change your life. You are not here to follow. Instead, you are here to lead and be an example for so many that want to break free from their limitations but need “permission” to do so. Your ability to flip the script and explore what now suits you versus what no longer applies will create a new identity for you that generates more wisdom and abundance and expands on your legacy. You are invited to stay teachable, lead with intellect and discernment, and use your innate spiritual technology that lives within you to reinvent ways of living that are efficient and needed. Great expansion lies in entrepreneurship and possibly the writing industry. Fresh ideas will come fast, so capture them before they fade. Just be mindful not to overthink. Learn as you go. Spirit’s saying: Your voice is evolving, so let it. What you study, share, and speak this year becomes the foundation of a new identity.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946628.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Cancer: 9 of Pentacles<br /></h2></strong><br />Cancer, 2026 is your soft life era, fully earned and fully embodied. The 9 of Pentacles confirms that your discipline and devotion are paying off. You can finally rest and let things come to you energetically rather than working toward a greater legacy. Everything you’ve built and worked on will manifest tenfold this year, so prepare to be in total overflow. This is the time to invest in upleveling your beauty, inner confidence, and luxury overall. Invest in yourself by pouring into you in ways that you were hesitant before. The luxury you will claim is rooted in self-worth, not validation from others. Your connection to the Divine is so unshakable that you have no doubt where your Source lies. Everything you touch will bloom. There is no limit to your magic and expansion.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946631.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Leo: 8 of Cups<br /></h2></strong><br />Leo, 2026 is your walk-away year, a period where you continuously choose yourself until that energy is locked into your DNA and you act from a space of Royal Sovereignty and opulence. This means that you are in a continual space of releasing not only that which you’ve outgrown but also what no longer resonates with you. You’ve found the secret of rapid quantum leaping, and it will seem like you’re jumping from one timeline to the next. This constant leap of transition marks that you are expanding your soul and are increasing your capacity to have more in every area of your life. The theme of 2026 is do not settle. You will have it all and more, and then you’ll realize that you deserve even more than what you initially thought. Flow with the momentum your inner Source and GPS is leading you on. You are not in perpetual cleansing and releasing but rather in perpetual becoming. You are no longer loyal and committed to things you did not choose for yourself. You are no longer holding space for energies and patterns you’ve inherited but have had no say on. Drop the struggle and the load. The journey ahead is about becoming light and sustaining it. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946637.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Virgo: Judgement<br /></h2></strong><br />Your spiritual glow up and understanding of where your own inner Source is leading you to are undeniable. You have no choice but to step ahead, regardless of your own irrational fears. Your higher calling is presenting itself to you and it is divine time that you answered. The Judgement card marks a rebirth: You’re shedding old versions of yourself, stepping into full purpose, and hearing Spirit loud and clear, as a lifestyle. Everything that felt confusing in 2025 suddenly aligns, and the rewards come through because you’re ready to live in truth and not illusion. Your ancestors are calling you into greater service in so many ways, to lead, to heal, to teach, and to transmit your wisdom. You will not have the space to second-guess yourself, and you won’t even think of it because your connection to Source will be so undeniable that you will let Source take the wheel and do the heavy lifting. This is your awakening year, and the miracles will overflow. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946632.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Libra: Queen of Cups<br /></h2></strong><br />This is the year when you soften further and rest in your divine feminine energy. It is a year of ease, peace, comfort, and radical self-trust. The Queen of Cups invites emotional mastery, not through control but rather through surrender. You will have the resources to process any emotion skillfully and also activate your psychic and intuitive gifts on a new level. This is a non-negotiable. You’re learning that sensitivity is strength and that your intuition is your most reliable currency. Allow it to speak to you in ways it hasn’t before and use it more actively. This year, your healing, creativity, and compassion become magnetic forces that open new doors in love and purpose. Spirit’s asking you to pour from a full cup, not a fractured one. Where you once overgave, that stream is now closed for your own use. Spirit will be speaking to you loudly, and the more you indulge in your own sweetness and softness, the more things will flow in your favor. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946635.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Scorpio: The Emperor  <br /></h2></strong><br />Scorpio, 2026 is all about embodying authority and creating the systems, routines, and discipline that will take you to the next level. The Emperor shows that you’re no longer playing with your potential; you are utilizing your masculine energy to build a structure that is the epitome of long-lasting wealth. It is a year when every area of your life is about to massively expand, but this comes with you enforcing strong boundaries and getting very clear on what it is you want. You won’t have time to entertain anything that isn’t for you or is underneath you. Own your power and claim the spotlight. You will have to become the leader that you’re seeking. There is no blueprint for your life; you are creating it along the way. Manifest your empire through organization and clarity. You’ve done enough dreaming.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946634.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Sagittarius: 5 of Swords<br /></h2></strong><br />Sagittarius, 2026 will pull you into radical honesty and will reveal all of your energetic leakages — or rather where you are being drained energetically in all areas of your life. Prepare to rid yourself of people, ways of being, and potential trajectories you thought you’d be on, and embark the journey of uncertainty. This year asks that you allow Spirit to take the wheel and provide the next steps and resources for you. This requires that you surrender and have faith in the journey unfolding. Don’t battle yourself. Preserve your energy for things that enhance and excite it. Playing small, over-explaining yourself, entertaining energetic vampires, and engaging in drama will no longer play a vital role in your life. You are clearing out old wounds and acting from a space of deliberate intention. Peace over everything — that’s how your blessings unfold. </figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

On Wednesday evening (05.11.2025), the largest full moon of the year can be seen over Germany – a so-called supermoon. According to the Association of Astronomers (VDS), the moon will then appear particularly large because it will only be around 356,400 kilometers away from the Earth at 11.16 pm. At other times, the moon is more than 400,000 kilometers away from the Earth. Photo: Patrick Pleul/dpa (Photo by Patrick Pleul/picture alliance via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As we come nearer to closing out 2025, the Cold Moon in Gemini on December 4th serves up some positivity for us all in the midst <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Sagittarius season</a> — putting us in an excellent mindset. In short: It is the vibe shift we’ve been waiting for. </p>



<p>This is the second-to-last <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/super-beaver-full-moon-in-taurus-horoscope-november-2025-meaning-effects"">supermoon in the series</a>; the next one occurs on January 3rd 2026. A supermoon occurs when the moon is in proximity to the earth in parity. When this happens, we feel the effects of illumination more deeply and intensely as the moon appears to be fuller, brighter, and shinier.</p>



<p>The last Full Moon of 2025 is asking us to make crucial decisions before New Year. We are torn between two different directions, offering us the chance to evolve or stay the same. The caveat is that we may not be ready to move forward, as numerous loose ends need to be addressed. These issues have been swept under the rug because we’ve been lost in a sea of emotions this past month, when five planets were retrograde, tugging at our heartstrings and making us yearn for the past. It’s no wonder we’ve been in a haze.</p>



<p>As we dust off the stale vibes, the Full Moon calls upon us to be more open with our emotions and discuss them with others. Since the Nodes of Destiny are squaring the lunation, we need to be ready to state our opinions. There can be issues in communication, causing problems with others. Still, if we mentally grow and use this opportunity to be more direct and not hold back, then we will be able to move past the internal conflict and tension that we are feeling. Letting go of our old patterns will be challenging, and we may fluctuate throughout the process. It’ll take a minute, even though we are starting the journey now.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury is still in its “retroshade”</a> phase since the planet ended its retrograde on November 29th. Mercury is still dealing with situations brought on by the retrograde until December 16th, when it clears the post-shadow zone. As a result, we may still be dealing with issues from then, as Mercury is revisiting that timeline. Therefore, it’s essential to think before speaking and not act impulsively, as there may be sensitivities that others feel, including ourselves. Being kind and compassionate is always crucial in times like these, especially since the mutable Supermoon takes on the sentiments of those surrounding them.</p>



<p>Remember that three planets are currently moonwalking in the sky: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter in Cancer</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uranus-retrograde-gemini-taurus-september-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Uranus in Taurus</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/neptune-retrograde-in-aries-pisces-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Neptune in Pisces</a>. While they don’t have an intense or immense impact on us, they’ll reveal the motives of others. They are helping us to understand the importance of living our best lives — no matter what’s gone down in the recent past. The future seems to be prosperous and infinite, giving us an optimistic push toward our aspirations.</p>



<p>This energy is highlighted by the presence of the star Cursa (fixed stars add seasoning to the flavor of planets), which plays an important role during this lunation. Being that Cursa is beneficial and lucky, we’ll be able to get through problems without a hitch. The universe is offering us the opportunity to enhance our fortune by giving us an abundance of love and kindness. Cursa is making us extremely sociable and wanting to connect with others. Beware that it can unlock scandals, so don’t repeat rumors that may or may not be valid. </p>



<p>Even though things may seem grim before the Full Moon, the energy will give us the motivation to tap into the power within ourselves. This is an opportunity for us to make things better — especially for ourselves and those we care about.</p>

<p>Amid all the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-cyber-monday-deals"">Cyber Monday sales</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-art-of-giving"">gift season frenzy</a>, and new <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-dresses-2025-latina-brands"">holiday collection drops</a>, the shopping landscape may feel like an avalanche of <em>too many</em> new and shiny things to cart up. But we’re briefly plowing back all of that to shine a light on H&amp;M’s latest (and coveted) collaboration. This time, the reader-favorite retailer has teamed up with luxury ski and lifestyle brand <a href=""https://www.perfectmoment.com/us/en"">Perfect Moment</a> on an après-ski-inspired winter collection. <br /><br />“Après-ski has always had a certain energy: relaxed, comfortable, social, playful, and glamourous,” said Perfect Moment co-founder and creative director Jane Gottschalk, in a press release. “Together [with H&amp;M], we’ve curated a collection that brings the spirit of both brands to life. The pieces are young, fun, [and] sporty, with a winter heartbeat and a nod to the mountains, but belong just as much in the city.” <br /><br />The <a href=""https://www2.hm.com/en_us/ladies/shop-by-feature/2003-perfect-moment-hm.html"">28-piece capsule collection</a> spans versatile knitwear, down-filled outerwear, and statement accessories — like cozy hats and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-puffer-boots"">puffer boots</a> — in a chic winter color palette of black, white, silver, rich burgundy, and icy blue.<br /><br />“We’re thrilled to be collaborating with Perfect Moment on this winter collection — it’s unexpected, dynamic, and sure to spark excitement,” said H&amp;M creative advisor and head of womenswear design, Ann-Sofie Johansson, in the release. “The silhouettes are glamorous yet laid-back — just like après-ski — but also have a real edge with the leather, faux fur, and textured knits.”</p>

<p><em>This Black Friday and Cyber Monday, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">editor-favorite skincare brand Medik8</a> is offering </em><strong><em>30% off sitewide</em></strong><em> from </em><strong><em>November 20 through December 2</em></strong><em>.</em> </p>



<p>As a beauty and shopping writer, I’ve spent countless hours interviewing dermatologists and estheticians, picking their brains for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dermatologist-skin-care-advice"">skincare advice</a> and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/skincare-beauty-products-stop-using-summer"">beauty products</a> they’d happily spend their hard-earned money on. Whenever I ask for recommendations on how to build an effective, no-nonsense routine, one brand comes up time and again: <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8</a>. </p>



<p>There’s a good reason why this <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">British skincare brand</a> has captured the attention of so many in-the-know experts. The brand is most beloved for its <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/crystal-retinal"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Crystal Retinal range</a>, which offers retinal (a vitamin A derivative targeting uneven skin texture and pigmentation) at various concentrations. This tailored approach allows you to find the retinoid strength that works best for your skin without irritation. Other <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8 products</a>, such as the <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/c-tetra-advanced"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">vitamin C serums</a> and <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/advanced-night-ceramide"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ceramide moisturizers</a>, are also highly rated for their efficacy.</p>



<p>Since <strong>Medik8 is currently offering <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">30% off sitewide</a> until December 2</strong>, we couldn’t help but share the bestselling products we’ll be carting up during this major <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-friday-deals"">Black Friday beauty sale</a>.</p>

<p>As someone who has sensitive skin, a product that doesn’t cause an instant uncomfortable reaction is a keeper for Susan Devaney, Refinery29’s lifestyle director. Enter: <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/crystal-retinal?variant=36716424560791"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8 Crystal Retinal 3</a>. “I use it twice a week at night, and I honestly notice my skin feeling softer and brighter when I wake the following day,” she says. Devaney adds, “I’m aware <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"">that retinal</a> [a form of vitamin A that’s more gentle but faster-acting than retinol] helps to keep skin in better shape by targeting hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone. I’m in my 30s, so this feels like a good investment to make for my future self. I apply SPF to my skin daily, too, which is a must when using any retinal product.” </p>

<p>Refinery29’s beauty director Jacqueline Kilikita used <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/total-moisture-daily-facial-cream"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">this moisturizer</a> down to the very last drop, and while this might not seem like an impressive feat, for a beauty editor whose job it is to try everything all at once, it says something about how excellent it is. “I love the cushiony texture that sits somewhere between a gel and a cream; it quenches my parched patches in seconds, all without leaving behind a greasy or tacky residue,” says Kilikita. The star ingredients are peptides (essentially skin-strengthening proteins), hydrating hyaluronic acid, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ceramides-skincare-eczema-dermatitis"">and ceramides</a>, which act like glue in between skin cells to keep them healthy and happy. “For me, ceramides are a must when I choose a moisturizer, especially in the winter when my skin becomes sensitive to cold weather and central heating,” adds Kilikita. Even better? It doesn’t break her out like other face creams. She’s already on her third tub. </p>

It contains 7% tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, a stabilized form of vitamin C that doesn’t irritate, and is enriched with nourishing jojoba oil. Reviewers praise this serum for making a difference to their skin’s overall radiance and improving dark spots. The texture is akin to a dry facial oil and feels a lot more moisturizing than most serums. </p>

<p><a href=""https://go.linkby.com/YNQTKZRJ/products/surface-radiance-cleanse?variant=37945194479802"">This gel cleanser</a> was recommended to Refinery29’s beauty director by a dermatologist when she was going through a period of hormonal acne, and she is convinced it helped to clear up her skin. The reason it’s so great for spots is that it boasts exfoliating alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) like lactic acid and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) like salicylic acid. The former chips away at dead skin cells and minimizes the appearance of hyperpigmentation, while the latter goes a little deeper, breaking up the mixture of dead cells, oil, and dirt that clogs pores. While it sounds powerful, it’s actually very gentle and never dries out the skin thanks to a heavy helping of moisturizing glycerin. </p>

<p>Celebrity dermatologist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/drewomaukeleghe/?hl=en"">Dr. Ewoma Ukeleghe</a> once described <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/liquid-peptides"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Liquid Peptides</a> as ‘Botox in a bottle,’ and we couldn’t agree with her more. The star ingredient is a hefty 30% concentration of 10 peptides. If you’re unfamiliar with peptides, they’re essentially proteins that boost collagen and elastin — the two things responsible for keeping skin supple. Despite these powerhouse ingredients, it’s surprisingly lightweight and absorbs quickly. Apply it in the evening and wake up to bouncy skin.</p>

<p>This oil cleanser emulsifies on contact with water, turning into a silky milk that dissolves everything from multiple coats of mascara to heavy foundation and sunscreen — all without drying out your skin. That’s thanks to the mega mix of omega-6, vitamin E, and plant extracts that nourish the delicate skin barrier rather than strip it. There’s a reason beauty editors always fall back on it.</p>

<p><a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/h-e-o-mask"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">This two-step mask</a> is a saviour for dry winter skin — just don’t let the duo of products put you off. It’s meant to be a ritual. It contains a trifecta of moisturizing ingredients: humectants, which draw moisture into the skin; occlusives, which keep it there; and emollients, which soothe and soften dry, flaky skin. Even after one use of layering the two, you’ll notice that your skin looks fresher and noticeably less parched.</p>
