Since the horses, who are the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/search/projects/categories/stable"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">stable's </a>primary inhabitants, cannot articulate their needs, design relies on the rigorous requirements dictated by human caretakers, requiring a balance between streamlined human operations and maximized horse comfort and safety. Architects often seem to address this through three core principles: Equine Comfort &amp; Well-being, Contextual Materiality, and Operational Efficiency. Thus, the resulting layouts are characterized by rigorous zoning that <a href=""https://www.lighthoof.com/blogs/blog/horse-barn-layout-essentials-12-design-secrets-from-top-equestrian-architects?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">clearly separates the programs</a> into residential (stalls), service (tack, storage, wash, feed), and training spaces (arenas, walkers). The designs also address visual well-being: <a href=""https://www.merckvetmanual.com/behavior/behavior-of-horses/social-behavior-of-horses?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Horses are social animals</a>, so they strategically position stables to promote sightlines between animals and to the exterior, often employing louvered or open-frame systems. Furthermore, lighting is kept diffuse using materials such as translucent panels to prevent sharp, stress-inducing shadows in arenas. Similarly, circulation paths are designed for the safe, efficient movement of both people and animals.</p>",

<p>Set in the hills near <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/essaouira"">Essaouira</a>, Morocco, DDAR is a modern rustic villa that embodies a dialogue between tradition and contemporaneity, craftsmanship and landscape. Designed collaboratively by architect Othmane Bengebara and the owner, the house is conceived as a living structure rather than a fixed object — a place where architecture becomes a vessel for creation, exchange, and cultural transmission. Built by hand using ancestral techniques, the villa draws from the vernacular forms of rural Morocco, merging local know-how with an environmentally conscious approach to design. Its irregular rhythm, tactile surfaces, and sculptural volumes blend seamlessly into the surrounding terrain, giving the impression that the house has grown organically from the land itself.</p>",

In this system, design has largely been co-opted as a tool for increasing profits, optimizing efficiency, and driving consumption — rarely questioning the foundations of the systems it serves.</p><p>As designers, we often find ourselves caught between:</p><ul><li>The practical necessity of working within existing systems to earn a living and have immediate impact</li><li>The moral imperative to imagine and create fundamentally different systems that center human dignity, social justice, and ecological health</li><li>The professional challenges of balancing client expectations with our deeper values and ethics</li><li>The emotional labor of holding hope for transformation while facing the limitations of incremental change</li></ul><p>This reality creates a fundamental tension between “within” and “beyond” We recognize the need for radical systems change while needing to function in the current system in order to pay our bills. These tensions aren’t just philosophical — they manifest in everyday decisions about which projects to take on, how to approach design challenges, whose voices to amplify, and what futures we choose to help create. It raises questions about complicity, compromise, and the real possibilities for change within and beyond the systems we inhabit.</p><p>As I’ve been thinking about a better future for and through design, I’ve been asking myself:</p><blockquote><em>How can we shift within the current system as we work to a better one?</em></blockquote><p>In my explorations, I’ve found three different ways to shift within the current system: practicing harm reduction, building movements, and centering rest as a form of resistance here and now.</p><h3>1. Practice harm reduction</h3><p>I think our role today is to practice harm reduction within the current system and minimize damage through immediate interventions like making existing services more accessible or policies more equitable, while simultaneously imagining and prototyping entirely new ways of organizing society, work, and care.</p><p>One of the most accessible and powerful ways designers can practice harm reduction is by asking better, braver questions. Questions that slow down the pace of “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhU0hRng-eE"">solutionism</a>“ and open space for reflection:</p><ul><li>​​Who benefits from this design — and who might be excluded or harmed?</li><li>What values are embedded in this solution?</li><li>What voices are missing from this process?</li><li>What assumptions are we making about users, needs, or impact?</li><li>What happens when we ask “at what cost?” instead of just “how might we?”</li></ul><p>Many of these questions were first introduced through <a href=""https://designjustice.org/"">The Design Justice Network</a>. Their work centers principles and practices meant to shift what we work on, who our work is in service for, and how we do the work as designers. Design is often framed as a neutral tool for innovation, but this view ignores the power dynamics and inequalities baked into the systems we operate in. Practicing harm reduction means rejecting neutrality. It means acknowledging that our work participates in shaping the world — often in ways that reinforce existing hierarchies unless we actively push back.</p><p>When I think of design and its ability to create change, I think about the dance between possibility and responsibility. Our work can either harm or heal. A few months ago, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/idampersson_good-design-is-a-dance-between-curiosity-activity-7208430723320422400-dFkn?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop"">I posted this on Linkedin</a> “Good design is a dance between curiosity and criticality. As designers, we love asking, “how might we” but we also have to ask “at what cost.” Design can heal but it can also harm. As designers, we must balance possibilities and responsibilities. We must be curious AND critical.”</p><h3>2. Build movements</h3><p>Building movement is another way we can create change within the current system. When we take a look around, we see many movements and organizations working to fight the current system and help us live better within them and throughout history movements like Black Lives Matters, <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=452a92eb2c2ade68&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enDE1084DE1084&amp;cs=0&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifPEI14tTYBaOXPPY93OhusSAziItQ%3A1756923972799&amp;q=Disability+Rights+Movement&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi30Yjqm72PAxUK9bsIHUphGVIQxccNegQIBhAB&amp;mstk=AUtExfDbXQ0XBuWo4KcGM-UFM6qZYGH8B1jwOTMHkxTUm5RLgM7OtDDhwTYnGCnC19bUqDtYOAEd2Xh4BNxa-tXnyhQL_3ZW_mVLFg_r1jv-CKgenSmZnLgqlNnsL4UEPPYJp0Mz3uIwUnZmQ4xN1Abd8PhUI7YN0X_TFVT2jbVIIXKklH9Ha7lzX5KKxWSYXk4s0LWGhcezfUJPeh-hPVVSAsYIcuVQLdU5vcFzr75mDfz17Y3215Thmk8PsAOjDYnhFXPhAmJladFpI8bKLyhxFMnU40GVaf1UOuH1Ow-E-tn6pw&amp;csui=3"">Disability Rights Movement</a>, Gay Rights Movements, etc. have paved the way for many of the rights we have today. Within design, <a href=""https://designjustice.org/"">Design Justice</a> movements, <a href=""https://www.tidsociety.com/"">Trauma-informed design</a>, etc. have made our profession more accessible while questioning the powers at play. Movements are ways to challenge the current systems from within and hopefully dismantle them in the future.</p><p>Many movements we champion today exist precisely because <strong>the current system doesn’t allow for equality and justice. </strong>Feminism responds to gender inequality. Disability rights acts respond to systems that don’t accommodate differences. In an ideal future, we won’t need these movements — but until we get to a liberated future, our job is to reduce harm through movement building.</p><h4>Movements vs. identity</h4><p>In her book <a href=""https://decolonialfutures.net/hospicingmodernity/"">Hospicing Modernity</a>, Vanessa Machado de Oliveira (formerly Vanessa Andreotti) shares an anecdote around movement building. During a panel discussion on global feminism, she was asked what role global feminisms will play in decolonial futures. She responded: “If we still had to talk about global feminisms in a supposedly decolonized future, something would have definitely gone wrong.” She continued, “When I identify as a feminist, I see the point of my role as working myself out of the need for feminist critiques in the future, rather than indefinitely investing in a collective identity.”</p><p>Machado de Oliveira highlights an important difference between a movement and an identity. While many movement help us fight for ours and others rights, clinging to the cause as identities CAN limit our ability to let go of the movement when they no longer serve the intended cause anymore. It can also keep us from connecting across differences and reject anymore who does not identify in the same way. As the writer and activist <a href=""https://adriennemareebrown.net/"">adrienne maree brown</a> writes:</p><blockquote><em>“We live inside of interlocking systems of oppression. These systems only work because we uphold them inside ourselves and between us. Rather than canceling each other for every way that we’re embodying the systems, we need to help break each other out of these systems and find ways to course correct for our country and our species together. When we turn on each other, the systems actually persist and they just go elsewhere. But when we actually heal each other and bring it all into the light, those systems become irrelevant. That’s what we actually need right now. For the planet’s sake and for our life on it, we need to hold on to each other and grow our soul.”</em></blockquote><p>When we create together we transform individual healing into collective progress. By turning toward one another, we can challenge the system and together create something that supports the well-being of all.</p><h3>3. Rest as resistance</h3><p>In order to continue to reduce harm and build movements that fight the current system, we need to rest. Poet, performance artist, and activist <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricia_Hersey"">Trisha Hersey</a> promotes how “rest is resistance”. In her book by the same name she explains that we can reclaim our sense of worth by resisting the grind culture and choosing rest. She positions rest as a human right — not something that needs to be earned. Her book was transformative for me. I found the book in a time where I was working hard to reach new heights while ignoring burnout signs from my body and my mind. It helped me evaluate where I was pushing beyond my own boundaries and how it kept me from being able to fight for others.</p><p>Resistance is different from resilience. It doesn’t tell us to push through or become stronger than the system. Rather, it helps us unlearn what we’ve been taught and resist what’s being reinforced about hard work through the larger paradigm. <a href=""https://medium.com/@augustvoyej/how-gen-z-is-challenging-the-concept-of-hustle-culture-bf6db8819db3"">The rejection of hustle culture has been embraced by many</a>. It’s not just a way to reclaim our worth but also a way to wake up and see clearly how the current culture of productivity, capitalism, and speed harms both ourselves and the planet.</p><p>Centering rest as a radical act can help us survive with a little more ease in a system that wants to exploit us.</p><h3>From Within to Beyond: Bridging the present and the future through The Adjacent Possible</h3><p>Between “within” and “beyond” lies what innovation theorist <a href=""https://adjacentpossible.substack.com/about"">Steven Johnson calls “the Adjacent Possible”</a> — spaces of possibility that become available from our current position. These are the opportunities that exist not in some distant utopia but in the immediate next steps we can take.</p><p>In the book <a href=""https://stevenberlinjohnson.com/where-good-ideas-come-from-763bb8957069"">Good Ideas</a> (shop at your local book shop), Johnson writes “The adjacent possible is a kind of shadow future, hovering on the edges of the present state of things, a map of all the ways in which the present can reinvent itself.” Each moment in our history unlocks new doors of adjacent possibilities.</p><p>The Adjacent Possible reminds us that transformation occurs not in sudden leaps but through continuous exploration of emerging possibilities. It’s about finding footholds for change within our present reality that can lead toward more substantive shifts.</p><p><a href=""https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/audre-lorde"">Audre Lorde</a> said: “At the same time as we’re surviving in the mouth of the dragon, we also need to be feeding our vision.” Surviving within the mouth of the dragon means practicing harm reduction, building movements alongside others, and resting as a form of resistance. These actions can open up a space for us to free our vision of a better tomorrow. Let’s act together.</p><h3>Resources &amp; Inspiration</h3><ul><li><a href=""https://adriennemareebrown.net/""><strong>A</strong>drienne Maree Brown</a> — Author of <em>Emergent Strategy</em> and <em>Pleasure Activism</em>, exploring transformative justice, imagination, and movement building.</li><li><a href=""https://hospicingmodernity.org/"">Vanessa Machado de Oliveira (formerly Vanessa Andreotti)</a> — <em>Hospicing Modernity</em>: A powerful book on navigating collapse, decolonization, and reimagining systems.</li><li><a href=""https://www.bayoakomolafe.net/"">Bayo Akomolafe</a> — Philosopher, poet, and author of <em>We Will Dance with Mountains: Vunja</em>, exploring post-activism and new world-making.</li><li><a href=""https://youtu.be/EIISnE3GPJk?si=s5dIloP92vrD5nZG"">We Have to Reimagine Our World</a> with Indy Johar (Louisiana Channel) — A visionary architect speaks on redesigning institutions for systemic transformation.</li><li><a href=""https://www.unglobalpulse.org/document/the-most-creative-look-to-the-future-imagination-and-creative-practice-in-service-of-organizational-transformation/"">The Most Creative Look to the Future</a> from UN Global Pulse — A report on how creativity and artistic practice can catalyze systemic change.</li><li><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51525845-from-what-is-to-what-if"">From What Is to What If</a> by Rob Hopkins — A hopeful manifesto on unleashing imagination to shape more resilient, just, and beautiful futures.</li><li><a href=""http://www.liberatingstructures.com/"">Liberating Structures</a> — Practical microstructures for group collaboration, innovation, and participatory change-making.</li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=622b45c5c85f"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/shifting-within-creating-change-inside-a-corrupt-system-without-losing-ourselves-622b45c5c85f"">Shifting within: creating change inside a corrupt system without losing ourselves</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Seven design insights from taking Grammarly ads (too) seriously.</h4><figure><img alt=""A collage of pastel rectangles with exclamation marks, with a bold wavy line snaking between them like through a labyrinth."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*69TJE9nfEYpzRhienCAVzQ.png"" /><figcaption>Writing your way or pushing writing out of the way? Image by the author.</figcaption></figure><p>Three weeks ago, YouTube finally decided that I must be interested in writing. Fair enough: I’m a Human-Computer Interaction professor researching writing tools and the impact of AI. Soon, my feed filled with Grammarly ads — and I started reflecting on their curious messages.</p><p><strong>What if we took AI writing tool ads seriously<em>?</em></strong></p><p>Ads may seem an odd source for design reflection. Yet they are highly intentional design artefacts because they are expensive and compete for attention. They are forced to distil a design’s essential features and choose concrete values to highlight. This makes them spotlights on how a design wants to be seen and understood.</p><p>The key insight from my anecdotal ad-vestigation:</p><blockquote>As portrayed in their ads, these AI tools address people who don’t value writing for its intellectual or creative demands, and thus miss its opportunities for growth.</blockquote><p>In response, I outline seven design insights and questions to inspire alternative directions for your next (AI) writing tool design. They are organised into two parts: concepts and use cases.</p><h3>Concepts of human-AI interaction in writing tools</h3><p>The ads reveal several recurring themes in how human–AI interaction is framed within writing tools.</p><figure><img alt=""A collage of four Grammarly promotional images showcasing different AI tools. The visuals feature clean gradients and text about features such as “AI writing app,” “Paraphraser agent,” “Proofreader agent,” and “Humanizer agent.” Each image includes the Grammarly logo and brief taglines about improving writing clarity, tone, and efficiency."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g7rgjWiThQCmy0xCPrmu2A.png"" /><figcaption>Examples of the analysed ads. Image created from screenshots by the author.</figcaption></figure><h4>Interaction paradigm: What exactly is an agent?</h4><p>Some ads present Grammarly as an <em>app, </em>others as an <em>agent</em>. Interestingly, in both cases, they depict a toolbar or sidebar UI element. The only ad that shows a chat does not<em> </em>use the word <em>agent, </em>although chatting feels more characteristic of an agent than toolbars. This leaves open how Grammarly itself understands and operationalises “agent-ness”, at least in the ads I encountered.</p><p><strong>Questions for your design: </strong>Which interaction design, offering which (AI) capabilities, would make your system an <em>agent </em>rather than a <em>tool</em>, from a user’s perspective? And how does that serve your design goals?</p><h4>Task delegation: Avoiding writing with AI</h4><p>Mandy ads emphasise the appeal of delegating writing tasks to AI to save time and effort. Examples include slogans like <em>“Your work-life balance just got more manageable”</em> and <em>“Sound natural and polished without extra effort”</em>. One ad even promotes a <em>“Humanizer agent” </em>to <em>“Eliminate robotic phrasing”.</em> This likely targets those disappointed by past results with AI. Another ad mentions an <em>“AI lineup”</em>, implying delegation of writing to multiple agents<em>.</em></p><blockquote>Across these examples, the ads frame writing as labour to be avoided. As someone with a deep interest in writing, this does not speak to me at all.</blockquote><p><strong>Alternative design direction: </strong>How might we design tools that let writers delegate the tasks that <em>distract </em>from writing, rather than writing itself?</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of a Grammarly ad featuring the text “Start your best draft with this AI lineup” on a blurred background resembling a writing app. A blue paper plane icon and vertical toolbar with Grammarly-style icons appear on the right. The Grammarly logo is at the top center. The caption below reads: “Your best work deserves a powerful stage — Sponsored · Grammarly.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/624/1*-QvSZ83HsNf9Ow_r_KvHFg.png"" /><figcaption>An ad implying delegation of writing to a “lineup” of AI. Screenshot by the author.</figcaption></figure><h4>Writing stages: AI wants to help everywhere</h4><p>Several ads stress the user’s involvement through phrases that highlight “your” contribution. Examples include <em>“keeping ownership of your ideas”</em>, “<em>make your voice resonate with readers”, “Your best work deserves a powerful stage”, </em>and <em>“See specific ways to strengthen your essay”. </em>Across idea, voice, work, and essay, these ads imply that AI will assist at any stage of writing.</p><blockquote>Together, these ads position AI as always present, with no clear roles or boundaries. This might be less appealing to expert writers who know their workflows well.</blockquote><p><strong>Alternative design direction: </strong>What if we made it a deliberate design goal to constrain AI to a specific role, rather than letting it do everything? And how might we empower writers to shape the scope of AI functionality and its integration into UIs and workflows themselves?</p><h4>Cognitive processes: Typing but not writing</h4><p>One ad promised to <em>“Get Effective, Mistake-Free Writing Every Time You Type”. </em>This framing turns the user into a receiver of writing from an unspecified source, implied to be AI. The user is not entirely passive, though: They still “type” — but they do not “write”. This is a key difference. In the <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1177/0741088312451260"">cognitive process model of writing</a>, typing aligns with the <em>transcriber</em>, the most mechanical of the three processes. The other two are <em>proposer </em>(generating ideas) and <em>translator </em>(expressing them in words). The ad’s message thus assumes users who prefer to avoid the more creative efforts of writing.</p><p><strong>Alternative design direction: </strong>How might we design (AI) writing tools that help users actively explore their own ideas and expression, instead of passively receiving prefabricated language from the system?</p><h3>Use cases for AI writing tools</h3><p>The ads primarily target two audiences: students and professionals. Moreover, ideation appears as a third use case across both groups.</p><h4>Ideation — without exploration</h4><p>Several ads promise help with finding ideas at the start of a writing project. Examples include <em>“Say goodbye to blank-page scaries and jump-start ideas faster”</em>, “<em>Start your best draft with this AI lineup”, </em>and <em>“Jump-Start Ideas With Grammarly’s AI Brainstorming Features”. </em>The latter ad shows a brainstorming button that generates high-level essay content for a user-provided topic. I like that it offers possible directions without dictating details. However, the feature’s UI design limits exploration and iteration. It is crammed into a chatbox pop-up with no space and editing capabilities to compare or iterate on ideas.</p><blockquote>As shown in the ad, users are expected to immediately copy an AI-provided idea. This workflow seems unlikely to appeal to people who enjoy exploring many ideas before committing one to the page.</blockquote><p><strong>Alternative design direction: </strong>How might we design for a closer integration of ideation and writing? Of canvas and page? What if the AI’s role were to facilitate transitions between these processes, or to provide a substrate for exploration and iteration, rather than simply generating text to copy?</p><h4>Communication: Is AI polish all you need?</h4><p>Another group of ads focuses on writing as communication, such as <em>“Put your best foot forward”</em>, <em>“Send the right message”</em>, <em>“Get heads nodding on your first email instead of your fifth”</em>, and <em>“Communicate clearly, come across as you intend, and strengthen work relationships”</em>. Fittingly, these ads feature people rather than interfaces, highlighting the promise that AI will help the user be perceived positively.</p><figure><img alt=""A Grammarly ad showing a person with a beard looking focused while sitting indoors, with natural light and a plant in the background. White text on the image reads, “Send the right message.” The caption below says, “Get heads nodding on your first email instead of your fifth — Sponsored · Grammarly.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/624/1*XFKqMo4OwGzrTIQpnclPCw.png"" /><figcaption>An ad targeting the use case of writing for communication. Screenshot by the author.</figcaption></figure><p>However, the opposite can also be true: When a message is perceived as AI-generated, it can <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3491102.3517731"">decrease trust</a>. It remains unclear how the design mitigates these risks. The existence of a <em>“Humanizer Agent”</em> in another ad supports this: Why design features that require the user to also “humanize” the text?</p><p><strong>Alternative design direction: </strong>How might we design tools with a nuanced understanding of the social nature of writing in focus, rather than assuming that AI polish is all you need?</p><h4>Learning: Grades over growth</h4><p>Grammarly’s YouTube <a href=""https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfPYYNRetSN_cKgkv3vFk6A2Felr9_kfb&amp;si=KW1ZOhNwXRLSi_0X"">playlist</a> for students focuses on performance markers. Its slogans include <em>“Work faster and smarter”</em>, <em>“Make the grade”</em>, <em>“Submit high-quality work for school”</em>, and <em>“Craft your success story”</em>. The last one features a time-travel plot in which a student learns that <em>“everyone’s using it”,</em> and joining in will turn him into a CEO later in life. As an educator, I find this focus troublesome because the ads never portray students motivated by genuine learning.</p><p>Identifying this as the best marketing strategy for a writing tool may reveal more about cultural views of education than about the tool itself. A behind-the-scenes video titled <em>“How to succeed in school” </em>makes this even clearer:<em> </em>It interviews actors from the ads, who give personal advice such as <em>“don’t take it so seriously”</em> and <em>“people put too much emphasis on studying”</em>.</p><figure><img alt=""A frame from Grammarly’s YouTube video titled “How to Succeed in School | Behind the Scenes at Grammarly’s ‘Back to School’ Shoot.” It shows a person with long blonde hair, dressed in black, sitting on a gray chair and speaking to the camera.

A student reflects on edit suggestions: <em>“That’s true. This is much better. You know, I didn’t know my writing contained so many run-on sentences until I started using Grammarly.”</em></p><figure><img alt=""A frame from a Grammarly YouTube video showing a person with short dark hair wearing a green plaid shirt, sitting with a laptop in a bright, modern space.

Yet those demands offer opportunities for thinking, expression, personal insight, and skill development. I suspect this mismatch is a part of why AI tools can miss the mark with writers.</p><p>If we read ads as reflections of underlying design assumptions, they tell us something about tool design itself, not merely marketing strategy. This view motivated the questions above, pointing to alternative design directions.</p><p>Nevertheless, there’s a difference between how a tool is advertised and how it can be leveraged. In this spirit, and as a small experiment, I edited this article with Grammarly. I had a good experience with it in this limited role. I even liked some of the constraints of the free account: It marked sentences for me to revisit, yet hid the AI suggestions. I like to think that this prompted my own thinking. Some features, like “expert reviews”, also seem designed to generate questions rather than only answers. More broadly, I’m curious to see upcoming updates, from <a href=""https://www.grammarly.com/blog/company/introducing-new-superhuman/"">acquiring Superhuman</a> to proactive agents, and how these will be advertised — and to whom.</p><h3>Resources</h3><p>These references provide further reading on the mentioned concepts and suggested design directions:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3491102.3517731"">Perceptions of AI in email writing</a> and in other <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3613904.3641955"">interpersonal communication</a></li><li><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3698061.3726924"">Creativity support tools designed for more than productivity</a> and for <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3586183.3606831"">empowering writers</a></li><li><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3690712.3690725"">What if AI tools were designed to center writers’ own creative decisions?</a></li><li><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1177/0741088312451260"">The cognitive process model of writing</a> and the <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3581641.3584060"">role of AI suggestions therein</a></li><li><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3706598.3714119"">Combining canvas and page UIs for writing with AI features</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=1bab97d0fa98"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-ai-writing-tools-fail-to-speak-to-writers-1bab97d0fa98"">How AI writing tools fail to speak to writers</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

The <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2025/08/14/move-fast-and-break-things-as-strategy-tech-experts-takes/"">“move fast and break things” ethos</a> of the last two decades in tech is remarkably similar to the core themes of the 200+ y/o Shelley classic. The story of a creator obsessed with his own genius, blind to the consequences, who unleashes a powerful, uncontrolled creation into the world and then abdicates all responsibility for the harm it causes? An apt comparison, indeed.</p><p>Victor Frankenstein’s great folly lay <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/mit-press-scholarship-online/book/20711"">not in his ambition, but in his abdication</a>. Horrified that he “had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch,” he ran. He left his creation to be feared and misunderstood by a society that was not prepared for it.</p><p>This is the dilemma of the modern tech profession. We, the architects of the digital commons, have acted with the same hubris. We build systems optimized for profit and engagement, unleash them upon society, and then hide behind a structure of <a href=""https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/psychology/diffusion-responsibility"">diffused responsibility</a> when systemic harms emerge (<a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crl8d0x9lpdo"">teen mental health crisis</a>, <a href=""https://digitalchew.com/2025/10/21/are-tech-companies-fueling-political-division-in-the-u-s/"">political polarization</a>, <a href=""https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-psychiatry/article/technological-addictions-the-new-frontier-in-addiction-psychiatry/4160D1D48CD08BBC4AE03DEA90B6B9CE?utm_campaign=shareaholic&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_source=bookmark"">mass addiction</a>, <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/10/18/how-americans-view-data-privacy/"">erosion of privacy</a>).</p><p>Which brings me to another idea that occurred around the same time: “Terms of Service.” No, I’m not talking about the little box you check, having not read the thousands of words of dense, technical jargon. That is a symptom of the disease.</p><p>I’m talking about flipping this very concept on its head- an enforceable “Terms of Service” pledge to be taken by tech professionals (myself included, as a UX and brand strategist): an <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532770/"">oath</a> to address “Frankenstein’s dilemma” and finally take responsibility for our (co)creation.</p><h4><strong>From Open Commons to Unregulated Market</strong></h4><p>This call to action is made urgent by the industry’s own evolution. The ethos of the early internet was rooted in the promise of a decentralized, open commons: a <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/06/science/joichi-ito-innovating-by-the-seat-of-our-pants.html#:~:text=The%20Internet%2C%20on%20the%20other,groups%20at%20its%20%E2%80%9Cedges.%E2%80%9D"">“freedom to connect, to innovate, to program, without asking permission.”</a></p><figure><img alt=""A retro pixel-art graphic from an old operating system, showing a “Dialing Progress” window.

IYKYK. <strong>Image Credit:</strong> blockchaincompound.com</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, that ethos has been superseded. The commons has been enclosed and commercialized. Today’s dominant platforms are not public utilities but engines of monetization, driven by an <a href=""https://public.summaries.com/files/1-page-summary/the-attention-economy.pdf"">attention economy</a> that treats human focus as its primary resource.</p><p>In his book <strong><em>Technofeudalism, </em></strong>Yanis Varoufakis describes how</p><blockquote>“cloud capitalists… have mutated into something far grander: techno-lords presiding over cloud fiefs and accumulating a new form of rent- cloud rent-extracted from a new class of serf: the cloud serf.”</blockquote><p>The fundamental change in purpose- from a tool for communication to a system for extraction- is precisely why the field is overdue for an ethical overhaul.</p><h4><strong>Precedents for Accountability</strong></h4><p>This is not the first “wild west” in professional history…</p><p>Imagine you are a stonemason in ancient Greece, struck by a fever that will not break. You seek help in the agora, but the marketplace of “healers” is a chaotic spectacle.</p><p>One man offers a poultice of herbs mixed with magical charms. Another, a priest, insists your illness is a divine punishment and demands a sacrifice. A third offers a potion, but you’ve heard whispers that some such men are not above accepting payment to administer poison. Who do you trust with your life when there is no standard to distinguish a healer from a charlatan? This was the reality of the “medical profession” in Greece, circa the 5th century BCE.</p><p>Enter the <a href=""https://absn.northeastern.edu/blog/the-history-of-the-hippocratic-oath/"">Hippocratic Oath</a>: a radical intervention with a practical purpose and a lasting impact. A group of practitioners set themselves apart with a binding commitment to “abstain from whatever is deleterious and mischievous” and to act in the patient’s best interest, forging a pact of trust with a public desperate for it.</p><figure><img alt=""A close-up profile view of a Greek bust of Asclepius, the god of medicine, shown next to the Rod of Asclepius, which is a staff with a single snake coiled around it."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lNzULoQpd59brIvH3QbnMQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Asclepius, the Greek god of medicine. <strong>Image Credit:</strong> Inspired Pencil</figcaption></figure><p>Centuries later, other professions forged their own pacts. <a href=""https://ironring.ca/background-en/"">The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer</a>, along with the conferral of an Iron Ring, was born from the 1907 Quebec Bridge collapse, which killed 75 workers due to design flaws. While the legend that the first rings were made from the bridge’s wreckage is an embellishment, its endurance speaks to the profession’s embrace of a foundational lesson in humility. Similarly, the legal and financial professions bind practitioners as <a href=""https://scholarship.law.ua.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1034&amp;context=fac_articles"">‘officers of the court’</a> or with a <a href=""https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/fiduciary-duty"">‘fiduciary duty’</a>, a legal standard obligating them to act in their client’s best interest, not their firm’s.</p><p>In all cases, these oaths provide a higher authority to which the professional must answer, overriding the demands of a boss or a project budget. The tech industry, while relatively nascent, operates as a great exception.</p><p>Built on what Harvard Professor Shoshana Zuboff defines as</p><blockquote>“the unilateral claiming of private human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data,”</blockquote><p>our current model of “surveillance capitalism”(Zuboff) is not an inevitable result of technology, but a specific <a href=""https://www.oru.se/contentassets/981966a3fa6346a8a06b0175b544e494/zuboff-2019.pdf"">“economic creation”</a> that has thrived in secrecy and <a href=""https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/after-the-digital-tornado/caveat-usor-surveillance-capitalism-as-epistemic-inequality/9EB949FA5BD07CF448C7D8F6A226B975"">in the absence of law and regulation</a>.</p><p>The resultant system of unchecked growth without accountability now translates into our crisis of governance. Our informational reality and civic lives are predominately ruled by algorithms optimized not for truth, but for profit. In this economy, polarizing content is the most engaging and therefore the most profitable. Research confirmed that when Facebook’s algorithm (optimized for user engagement) was changed to boost posts with high emotional reactions, it <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2023/07/27/1190383104/new-study-shows-just-how-facebooks-algorithm-shapes-conservative-and-liberal-bub"">“inadvertently promoted toxic and anger-inducing content.”</a></p><figure><img alt=""A close-up photograph of the aged, paper label on an amber pharmaceutical bottle.

A more useful comparison, however, might be the pharmaceutical industry. After the <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3573415/"">thalidomide disaster </a>of the 1960s caused thousands of birth defects, governments began requiring “substantial evidence” of a drug’s safety and efficacy before it reaches the public.</p><p>We do not knowingly allow drug companies to “move fast and break things” with public health. Yet with technology, we continually do. Corporations treat multi-billion-dollar fines as a fractional “cost of doing business.” In 2023, the five largest tech firms were fined a combined $3.04 billion. They earned enough revenue to pay that entire sum in <a href=""https://proton.me/blog/big-tech-2023-fines-vs-revenue"">just over seven days</a>.</p><h4><strong>The Architecture of Diffused Responsibility</strong></h4><p>The modern tech company is a marvel of <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07935"">diffused responsibility,</a> a psychological phenomenon where individuals in a group feel less personal accountability. The UX designer optimizes for engagement. The engineer for stability. The product manager for growth. No single person can be held responsible for the systemic harms that emerge.</p><p>This is the system’s genius: it scales profit and impact while atomizing responsibility.</p><figure><img alt=""The popular “Spider-Man pointing” meme, showing three identical Spider-Man characters standing in a circle and pointing accusingly at each other."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TVpZX_q_jLQYFXkSx9sTag.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Actual depiction of designers, engineers, and product managers when asked, ‘Who is responsible for the rollout of this harmful feature?’ <strong>Image credit:</strong> Marvel Entertainment / From the 1967 <em>Spider-Man</em> animated series, episode “Double Identity”… meme-ified.</figcaption></figure><p>A new oath, therefore, cannot be a passive pledge. It must be an active, professional tool that empowers the practitioner to fight this diffusion. It must grant tech workers the formal standing to ask questions, the right to see data, and the power to refuse; not as a malcontent, but as a professional upholding their code.</p><p>Consider the designer asked to create a notification system using intermittent variable rewards (<a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brain-wise/201311/use-unpredictable-rewards-to-keep-behavior-going"">the same mechanism as a slot machine</a>) to maximize engagement. Ethical UX design principles dictate that a practitioner must <a href=""https://uxpa.org/uxpa-code-of-professional-conduct/"">“do no harm”</a> and put the <a href=""https://app.uxcel.com/tutorials/ethical-principles-for-creating-responsible-and-user-focused-ux-design-582#:~:text=UX%20design%20ethics%20means%20making,users%20have%20with%20your%20product."">user’s needs first</a>, but it would require something closer to a “Mandate of Inquiry” to fully empower the designer to ask: “Have we researched the potential impact of this on teen anxiety? Can I see that data before proceeding?” Under a protected oath, the designer is no longer a troublesome employee, but a professional upholding a standard.</p><p>It is crucial to distinguish such a framework as a set of <em>enforceable rights</em>, not as another aspirational pledge. The landscape is littered with <a href=""https://mkdale.github.io/techoath/"">“feel-good” oaths</a> and top-down corporate principles published by the very <a href=""https://ai.google/principles/"">companies causing harm</a>. These top-down models are ultimately toothless because they disempower the individual. They are tools for <a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_4864"">legal compliance</a> and public relations, not for the practitioner in the “engine room.”</p><p>Even our most evolved professional codes, such as those from the Association for Computing Machinery (<a href=""https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics/software-engineering-code"">ACM</a>), are largely silent on the employer-employee power dynamic. They are excellent at describing a practitioner’s duty- to <a href=""https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics/software-engineering-code"">prioritize the public good</a>, to <a href=""https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics"">“avoid harm”</a>, and to “<a href=""https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics"">challenge unethical rules</a>,” but they provide no tool or protection to do so against a conflicting order from management.</p><p>In other words, they tell the engineer to wave a flag at the runaway train, but offer no way to stop it. The practitioner who follows this duty is often the one who gets steamrolled, fired as a “dissenting employee” with <a href=""https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/conscientious-objectors-in-the-workplace-98913/"">little recourse</a>.</p><p>The following Mandates, therefore, propose a fundamental shift: from a passive duty to an active <a href=""https://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/negotiating-tech/governance-of-workplace-technology-applications/work-task-technologies-and-applications/control-ownership-and-protection-of-personal-and-professional-autonomy/"">power</a>. They are designed to arm the practitioner for that inevitable moment of conflict. While as yet imperfect and conceptual, they are intended to spark necessary conversation about what a framework of enforceable and protected ethics must look like, and how we, as a profession, can begin to implement it.</p><figure><img alt=""A symbolic image of a human hand shaking a glowing, blue, wireframe digital hand over a desk with a laptop on it."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1bCvg4YQsa9Jljd6vYQEhQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>A symbolic handshake represents the “Architect’s Mandate,” a proposed formal pact between a tech professional and the systems they build, ensuring rights and accountability. <strong>Image credit:</strong> Unsplash</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>The Architect’s Mandate: A Proposed Code</strong></h4><p>A functional oath for a tech professional would be less a pledge and more a formal declaration of professional obligations:</p><p><strong>I. The Mandate of Inquiry</strong></p><p>I shall have the protected right to ask “Why?”; to perform a root cause analysis on the intent behind the features I am asked to build. I will not be satisfied with metrics of “engagement” as a substitute for human value.</p><ul><li>This mandate is a direct antidote to the “architecture of diffused responsibility”. While existing codes suggest practitioners should <a href=""https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf"">“reflect upon the wider impacts of their work”</a> or <a href=""https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/initiatives/great-tech-great-responsibility/addressing-ethical-issues-tech-worker/"">“talk across teams”</a>, this provides a formal, protected right to demand answers and data, piercing the veil of organizational siloing.</li></ul><p><strong>II. The Mandate of Consequence</strong></p><p>I shall have the right to access any and all research on the likely human impact of my work before it is deployed. I pledge to place the long-term well-being of the user above the short-term metrics of the platform.</p><ul><li>This right is a novel mechanism for accountability. While human rights organizations often <a href=""https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/content/where-human-rights-and-engineering-meet"">partner with engineers to analyze data</a> and ethical frameworks discuss organizational <a href=""https://iabac.org/blog/ethical-data-engineering-the-challenges-of-responsible-data-handling"">“transparency”</a>, no code grants the individual practitioner an affirmative right to access internal impact research before a product’s release.</li></ul><p><strong>III. The Mandate of Refusal</strong></p><p>I shall not be compelled to design, build, or deploy systems that I believe, in my professional judgment, are designed to exploit human vulnerabilities, erode agency or privacy, or amplify division. I will have the protected right to refuse such work without fear of retaliation.</p><ul><li>This mandate radically expands the existing “right to refuse” work. Current legal protections are almost exclusively limited to situations of “imminent danger” of “death or serious injury”. This proposes a new, professional standard of refusable psycho-social harm, and demands explicit <a href=""https://www.eeoc.gov/facts-about-retaliation"">protection from retaliation</a> for what amounts to secular, professional <a href=""https://www.westsoundworkforce.com/conscientious-objection-in-the-workplace/"">“conscientious objection”</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>IV. The Mandate of Precedence</strong></p><p>I pledge to hold my duty to the public- their safety, their agency, and their mental well-being- as paramount, above my duty to my employer’s stock price or my project’s quarterly goals.</p><ul><li>This is the foundational principle of all mature professional codes. The National Society of Professional Engineers, for example, states that the <a href=""https://www.nspe.org/sites/default/files/Ber97-5-app.pdf"">“highest ethical obligation is to protect the public health and safety”</a>. This mandate affirms that this established principle must finally be applied to the digital world.</li></ul><p><strong>V. The Mandate of Testimony</strong></p><p>I shall have the protected right to bear witness to systemic public harm caused by a product I helped create, even after its release. My professional duty to warn the public shall supersede any non-disclosure agreement or corporate policy, and I shall not be subject to retribution for this testimony.</p><ul><li>This is a potent synthesis of legal and ethical precedent. It argues that a tech professional’s <a href=""https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/communication-and-mass-media/duty-warn"">“duty to warn”</a> the public of danger, a duty that supersedes confidentiality in <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK542236/"">medicine</a> and <a href=""https://www.nspe.org/career-growth/ethics/board-ethical-review-cases/signing-confidentiality-agreement-duty-disclose"">traditional engineering</a>- must also supersede a non-disclosure agreement or policy. While <a href=""https://www.whistleblowers.org/non-disclosure-agreements-and-whistleblowers/"">whistleblower laws</a> already protect reporting of <em>illegal</em> activity and courts can compel testimony, this mandate seeks to extend that protection to testimony regarding <em>systemic public harm</em> that is not yet explicitly illegal.</li></ul><p><strong>VI. The Mandate of Audit</strong></p><p>I shall have the protected right to audit the data sets and models I am asked to use before deployment. I will have the right to test for, document, and mitigate algorithmic bias, even if it conflicts with a project’s timeline or stated goals.</p><ul><li>This mandate targets a well-documented harm: AI systems that perpetuate and amplify societal biases. An algorithm is often <a href=""https://www.proskauer.com/podcast/ai-bias-audits"">“only as good as the data that was used to train [it]”</a>. While some laws require top-down corporate <a href=""https://www.brookings.edu/articles/auditing-employment-algorithms-for-discrimination/"">“bias audits”</a>, this mandate grants the right to the practitioner, empowering them to test models and retrain or suspend biased algorithms as a matter of professional practice.</li></ul><p><strong>VII. The Mandate of Sustainable Design</strong></p><p>I shall have the protected right to refuse work that I believe, in my professional judgment, intentionally implements planned obsolescence or demonstrably contributes to environmental degradation.</p><ul><li>The tech industry is a massive contributor to e-waste and environmental harm, often by design (a <a href=""https://www.iberdrola.com/sustainability/planned-obsolescence"">“deliberate industrial strategy”</a>). This mandate extends the “right to refuse” beyond immediate human danger to include systemic environmental danger, empowering engineers to advocate for sustainable <a href=""https://www.computer.org/press-room/2016-news/code-of-ethics"">“green” engineering principles</a> and refuse to participate in practices they know to be destructive.</li></ul><p>The framework outlined here is not a plea for rebellion. If the “move fast and break things” era was marked by a defiant, adolescent, Frankenstein-esque hubris, this proposal is (conversely) a declaration of industry maturation. It is our chance to act on what Frankenstein only briefly glimpsed long after abandoning his creation, when he confessed,</p><blockquote>“For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were…”</blockquote><p>A codified set of principles, with the ultimate goal of legal enactment, is what separates a collection of atomized employees from a unified profession. A single person can be <a href=""https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/conscientious-objectors-in-the-workplace-98913/"">fired</a>; a profession with a shared, legally-enforceable code of conduct has power.</p><p>We are not at the mercy of an unregulated “tech monster” beyond our control. We are its architects and gatekeepers. This is the moment we stop abdicating and choose to fulfill the duties of a creator.</p><p>This is the blueprint. It is time to take ownership.</p><p><em>I invite a public critique of these mandates from all professionals in the field.

<h3>How to nail onboarding — a case study of Runna</h3><h4>Lessons in clarity, confidence and community</h4><p>Nearly <a href=""https://www.runna.com/en-gb/strava-acquires-runna"">1 billion runs</a> were recorded on Strava in 2024.</p><p>Targeting runners is a <em>big</em> market.</p><p>And it’s a market that’s growing — according to <a href=""https://www.runna.com/en-gb/strava-acquires-runna"">Strava</a>, running was the ‘fastest growing sport globally’ with ‘Gen Z turning to running to create community and connection’.</p><p>Which is the <strong>winning strategy</strong> for coaching app <a href=""https://www.runna.com/"">Runna</a>.</p><p>If you run, you’ve probably heard of Runna. The consumer app is<em> all over</em> Instagram, TikTok, and Strava, with 48,000+ ratings at 4.9 stars on the app store. The <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/runna/"">Reddit community</a> alone now has around <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/runna/"">47,000 members</a>.</p><p>Officially launching in March 2022, Runna reached <a href=""https://www.standard.co.uk/news/tech/strava-acquires-popular-runna-app-b1222946.html"">7,000 paying subscribers</a> a year later and has since helped <a href=""https://www.runna.com/en-gb/strava-acquires-runna"">millions of runners complete their first race</a>.</p><p>In April 2025, Runna was acquired by Stava for an unknown amount. Though <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/seb-johnson_strava-runna-crowdfunding-activity-7324024883418382336-xTC2?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACEru7kB8-Anzw-Z0Ee3-GIgCyW6sGkmrp0"">estimates</a> are around £150 million, based on a 30X return to early crowdfunding investors, who invested when it was valued at £5 million (30 X £5M = £150M).</p><p>That’s when I decided to see what all the hype was about.</p><p>The acquisition caught my eye, and so did the fact that my friends had just signed me up for a half-marathon 🫠 As a Strava paying subscriber, I got the email about a Strava × Runna bundle, it made sense to give it a go.</p><p>And this is that story: <strong>my journey through Runna’s incredible onboarding.</strong></p><p>We’ll see three big lessons across the onboarding flow, covering:</p><ul><li>Why most product marketing tests fail to have an impact, but Runna’s packs a punch</li><li>Where user-generated content and community can come into onboarding</li><li>How certain industries need a longer onboarding process</li></ul><p>By the end we’ll see that there’s nothing flashy about Runna’s onboarding. It just makes you believe you can actually <strong>do it.</strong></p><p>We’ll also see just how well I ran according to my plan 👀</p><p>Let’s jump straight into lesson one, starting from the first thing we see: a welcome screen carousel.</p><h3>Lesson 1) Show your product clearly</h3><p>Most apps try to look impressive. Runna just tries to make sense.</p><p>When I open the app on my phone for the first time, I see an onboarding carousel which looks slightly old-school, but I love it.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*puktDueirGzA1V4APH4rLw.png"" /></figure><p>The classic saying is that ‘no one reads an onboarding carousel’.</p><p>Which, in my experience is <strong><em>half true.</em></strong></p><p>Studies have shown users don’t have time to read: most people read <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-little-do-users-read/"">28% of the words on a page; 20% is more likely</a>.</p><p><em>However, </em>I’ve added a carousel before a paywall before and it <em>improved</em> conversion to trial. So there’s something to be said for adding extra context for customers.</p><p>In my view, Runna’s carousel works here. It does three things really well:</p><ul><li>It runs through screens like an Instagram story (no tapping required)</li><li>There’s very few words (max 9 in each headline)</li><li>Imagery does the heavy lifting</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tM4tOfgJx7KE-v_icAgRAw.png"" /></figure><p>The Instagram-style story creates a <strong>variable reward</strong> 🧠 as you don’t know what’s coming next. It also follows a common consumer app <strong>mental model</strong> which works well in this context.</p><p>What stands out here is the <strong>imagery. </strong>From the second carousel screenshot, it’s clear to me what a ‘personalized running plan’ might look like.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/499/1*7qWurLh6N8_B45Bv4qJEOA.png"" /></figure><p>As someone who gets injured all the time and has no real game plan for running, this structure, clarity and format made me sigh with relief.</p><p>It created a mini-magic-moment for me early on.</p><p>On the fourth screenshot, my running injuries came to life:</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/499/1*VQ2LUfE70GJusdfKNW-u9w.png"" /></figure><p>Runna has used the most common running injury (Achilles Tendinitis) as an example, with micro copy:</p><ul><li>Get back to running quickly and carefully</li><li>Returning to running post-injury</li></ul><p>They know that this is one of the biggest fears, frustrations, or anxieties that holds people back from running. Whether it’s past injuries or future injuries, with these images, Runna is signalling:</p><blockquote>We’ve got you</blockquote><p>Does this impact conversion? Hard to say. My gut says no.</p><p>In my experience, I’ve rarely seen adding imagery into onboarding improve conversion.</p><p>That’s because it’s<strong> really hard to do well.</strong> You need to have excellent image designers and really think about what will make people have a lightbulb moment. Imagery needs to be:</p><ul><li>Easy to scan, easy to see</li><li>Use specific, real examples</li><li>Be able to be understood in a moment’s glance</li></ul><p>That’s a tough order.</p><h3>Lesson 2) Bring your marketing inside your product</h3><p>Runna’s onboarding starts long before download. Its community and content seep straight into the product journey.</p><p>The first obvious thing I noticed is the authentic lifestyle imagery and social proof throughout the flow.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5n9jr3CzhOEc7aiLPyEktQ.png"" /></figure><p>After the carousel, I see a load of smiling women and men I want to be friends with sitting on a park bench.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/499/1*DvwkS7kpHdoUDI7J1U0WBg.png"" /></figure><p>Further into onboarding, after I select the run I’m doing, I see 230 other little avatars ready to run with me.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1023/1*LOg_JV9KEuFVRq41hmpqPg.png"" /></figure><p>There are little signals of value add here too:</p><ul><li>Date</li><li>Location</li><li>Run type = flat (thank god)</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/499/1*wm1VAYBXUyTxYs3kAjXI6w.png"" /></figure><p>Before this onboarding flow, I hadn’t checked the run route for the run I’d booked.</p><p>With these details (flat ‘elevation of 34 meters’ &amp; ‘230 others running’), the app has calmed some anxieties around being fit enough for hills and showed me other’s are doing it too. Quietly reassuring me:</p><blockquote>You got this</blockquote><p>And it continues…</p><p>At the end of onboarding, I see more runners 👀</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YYOQw1UL4xBai1_8GeXp5w.png"" /></figure><p>Notice how the human imagery varies:</p><ul><li>Full screen vs. small avatars vs. videos</li><li>Stylised shoots, vs ‘taken on the run’ vibes</li><li>Background gradient fade or spotlight image</li></ul><p>What’s curious is that these touch points are littered throughout. There are 30 screens I see in onboarding before I see my plan on the homepage.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*J3X4-NZI_xa3b0Sf1xD3DA.png"" /><figcaption>Too many to show…</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s a summary (as I know the above image is too small 🥴):</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4PRtTKhECrLY6nme_4v-BA.png"" /></figure><p>In terms of where the imagery sits, there’s imagery beginning, middle (almost) and end of onboarding. With a big cluster near the paywall.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZAcO9G_OXxNKMnYNtNc8ew.png"" /></figure><p>What I see here: a product direction that<strong> knows community is important.</strong> And an onboarding funnel that matches the acquisition funnel (influencer marketing, user-generated content in ads, reddit communities).</p><p>Whilst hard to execute, I’ve heard of experiments showing that matching ad creative and copy at the top of the funnel to the product journey, from onboarding to homepage, can improve conversion to paid and retention.</p><h3>Lesson 3) Design for confidence, not speed</h3><p>Everyone has fears.</p><p>My fears are around running (and the dark).</p><p>The key doubts on my mind coming into this were:</p><ul><li>Can I run this run I’ve booked?</li><li>Will my old injuries resurface?</li><li>Will I get new injuries?</li><li>Will I get faster? Can I run under 2 hours?</li><li>Can I fit this into my work week?</li><li>Will this app work with my garmin and strava set up?</li></ul><p>By the end of my 12-minute-long onboarding, <strong>I’m clear on all of the above.</strong> And honestly, I felt pretty relaxed about it all.</p><p>The hard part of testing onboarding is balancing two things:</p><ol><li>The macro steps (getting you set up, called ‘set up tasks’)</li><li>The micro details that aren’t crucial, but subconsciously push people along.</li></ol><p>On 1. it’s incredibly hard to prioritise what to put in onboarding. As a rule of thumb, if it positively impacts retention (i.e. when people take [product action] we see they retain better) then AB test it in onboarding to see if it’s a causal relationship, not just a correlation.</p><p>On 2, it’s even harder to make decisions of what small details to add. What micro copy will calm users, what images can help.</p><p>Individual, isolated tests rarely reach significance on these things. And if you’re not close to the customer, you can end up just adding words, steps and noise that get in the way.</p><p>For Runna, the macro steps are:</p><ul><li>Set a goal</li><li>Pick a race</li><li>Self select your running ability</li><li>What days would you like to run?</li><li>Predict your running time</li><li>Pick km/mi</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JjhBVSRr0-X7G7LFa3ho1Q.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*I1lhv5RHBbl39pfasKIVXw.png"" /></figure><p>From the copy on these steps, my anxieties around fitting the plan into my week, running a good pace and ‘will I be ready’ for my half marathon are covered.</p><p>Then it’s the micro details that add confidence. If I pick a 5k time that’s too fast, it tells me the app isn’t built for me.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tUtqzyLnTVHxJ331tvHseA.png"" /></figure><p>Which reinforces that I am in the right place, because I cannot run that fast (but I hope to one day).</p><p>The post-onboarding plan introduction takes the level of confidence one step further, with:</p><ul><li>Estimated race times</li><li>A guide to the four run types (with a coach video explainer for each)</li><li>The first of those workouts reflected in my plan (starting with an easy run, yay)</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zNKuHeM-Nmnap_J2VBUhTQ.png"" /></figure><p>The estimated times show me what I can achieve with and without the app:</p><ul><li>Without Runna: 1hr 59</li><li>With Runna: 8 minutes faster (1hr 51)</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/499/1*QwN9Bx5EWYFs__WJnbE2vg.png"" /></figure><p>Again imagery being used here to show value at a glance.</p><p>Lastly, the copy on ‘Types of run’ guides is just so simple.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HsjiGLuHHfonj-q2q5hsvQ.png"" /></figure><blockquote>‘The purpose of these runs is to recover and freshen up’</blockquote><p>No jargon, no running-speak. None of that elite language that puts people off.</p><p>Just plain old english. And again, none of it feels optimised. It’s just plain and simple.</p><p>Bish bash bosh.</p><h3>The summary: confidence is what Runna is optimizing for.</h3><p>By the time I finished onboarding, I hadn’t even started training but already felt more confident about the race.</p><p>Thinking back over this flow, the funny thing is that it isn’t particularly <em>sexy</em>. Runna doesn’t try to impress me.</p><p>Instead, every choice — from unhurried pacing to clear copy — signals that this app is serious about getting you to your goal.</p><p>It feels like the restraint on product sexiness or pazazz, and the focus on plain and simple, is what earns trust.</p><p>The irony is that this onboarding doesn’t just onboard you into an app. It onboards you into <strong>believing you can actually run the thing.</strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=7780ba89c202"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-nail-onboarding-a-case-study-of-runna-7780ba89c202"">How to nail onboarding — a case study of Runna</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

In November, the veil between the living and spirit realms is thin. This traditionally is a prime opportunity for us to tune into the silence and grasp the guidance that is being given to us through <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10722191/venerate-ancestors-year-round"">our ancestors</a> and spirit allies. Between <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dia-de-los-muertos-for-mom"">Día de Muertos</a> and Gede Season, spirit reminds us that death is not an ending but an additional chapter in our lives. It’s a new beginning of sorts. <br /><br /> This month, our task is to listen to the direction we are being pointed to. This will help us sharpen our intuitive and psychic gifts that we’ve inherited from our ancestors and surrender to whatever is meant to shed from our lives so that a new beginning can arise. This is a time to celebrate your lineage, pour libations, and embody the prayers that made you possible. November’s tarotscopes will grant you clarity on your next steps during this season.<figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941368.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Scorpio: Ace of Cups<br /></strong><br />This month is an emotional rebirth. Prepare to embody a more mature and abundant you. The ancestors and guides are pouring into you, whether that is through mirroring to you your truth and magnificence, providing juicy opportunities that will have your cup overflowing, or giving you the space to process your emotions and release in a safe way. Allow your heart to lead you. You’ve spent enough time surviving; now it’s time to receive. The Ace of Cups opens a new cycle of intimacy with yourself, your spirit, and the people who see you clearly. Don’t overthink. Let whatever is coming up to flow. What’s meant for you won’t require force. Your ancestors are blessing this new beginning. Drink from it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941369.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Sagittarius: Knight of Pentacles <br /></strong><br />This season implores you to slow down, milk the present moment, and seek the portal to all possibilities by enjoying the luxuries you have now. Find ways to devote to yourself versus rushing onto your next destination or attempting to control outcomes you have no control over. You are the wealth and success that you seek, so you do not chase something you already are. You are being asked to be disciplined on the homework your spirit guides have appointed to you. If you know doing something is for your betterment, commit to it. Be consistent. Everything you do, act on, say, think, and believe is sacred work. You are powerful. Focus on alignment and precision. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941370.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Capricorn: 7 of Wands<br /></strong><br />Your ancestors are fighting for you. They are carving pathways that you did not deem possible. They are defending your names behind closed walls and protecting you from unseen dangers and setbacks. Have you taken the time to thank them and to honor them? Have you considered what incredible qualities and characteristics you’ve inherited from them that you have yet to leverage? This season is about fighting back and ensuring that you will no longer play small or be taken for granted. Enough is enough. It’s time that you show the world what you are made of. Are you going to be a victim and just accept life’s circumstances as if you have no power of your own? Or will you invoke the flames of your ancestors to accept what is rightfully yours and enjoy every minute of it? </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941371.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Aquarius: Justice<br /></strong><br />Behind the scenes, your ancestors are ensuring that justice is paid off and that the scales are balancing in your favor. This season, say that powerful prayer that is known to clear the roads of obstacles and unfavorable conditions. Ask your ancestors to remove any limitations, hindrances, and unwarranted energies in your life that are keeping you from reaching your next level and are not for your highest good. Prepare for the plot twist of your life and for a new chapter to emerge with more clarity than ever. Remain in integrity with yourself and the spirit realm. If you say you will do something, do it. If you receive benevolent guidance that will accelerate your life, act on it. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941372.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Pisces: 6 of Swords</strong><br /><br />You’ve got the green light to move on. You are being supported by the spirit realm to make this transition and shed that energetic weight with as least resistance as possible. Anything that has been making you stuck or showing no progress, will now be alleviating itself from your life. Your ancestors are guiding the boat now, steering you toward calmer waters. Don’t look back out of guilt or nostalgia. What’s ahead is peace, clarity, and spiritual renewal. Trust the transition.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941373.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Aries: The Star</strong><br /><br />It is safe to believe again. Prior to this month, you might have questioned your desires and possibility of you actually attaining them. You may have questioned the route you are taking and whether or not you are on the right path. This season you will be shown just how aligned you are. Your ancestors are lighting the path ahead, showing you what’s possible when you believe again. This is your season to rebuild your faith, not from fantasy but from alignment with your higher purpose. You are blessed and highly favored. It is time to believe and pour into yourself so heavily that no other assumption exists. Allow yourself to shine because it is your identity. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941374.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Taurus: 4 of Swords</strong><br /><br />Rest is sacred work, and it holds the key to you attracting all that you need. The guides want you to slow down and intentionally implement old and new ways of relaxing and resting because that's how they get to speak directly to you without resistance. You need to be open and receptive to the guidance that wants to stream through. The information and downloads you receive this month are paramount to your evolution in life. Call your energy back to you and engage in practices that bring your awareness back into your body. Catch how many times your consciousness begins to wander somewhere outside of you and gently pull it back. Pause because clarity comes in stillness. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941375.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Gemini: 5 of Cups<br /></strong><br />You’re being asked to let go. Stop replaying what didn’t work or who didn’t stay. Something more glorious and aligned is on the horizon, but grief is keeping you from tapping into it. Give your sorrows, frustrations, and angst to your ancestors. Allow the emotions to be fully felt and embraced, but don’t hang onto them too long that they become a hindrance. This season, choose acceptance over attachment and seek peace. Mourn and release. Then lift your head, because the blessings ahead need your full presence and anticipation, not your pain.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941376.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Cancer: 10 of Pentacles<br /></strong><br />This season is about cementing your legacy through bold quantum moves. You’re not just acting from this timeline but from four timelines above it. Envision the person who already has what they want: what would that version want, and what would that other version want, and so on and so forth. Act from that space because leaping above the mundane is what’s going to set you apart and rapidly accelerate the attainment of your desires. You are not making yourself proud but breaking barriers for your entire lineage. The abundance is overflowing from you because you are secure in the embodiment of it. The amount of value you exude and provide is tremendous. Know that you are the answered prayer and everything you do moving forward will expand. Celebrate yourself and how far you’ve come. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941377.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Leo: 2 of Cups<br /></strong><br />You are being invited to learn more about yourself through your interactions and relationships with others. Your ancestors are sending mirrors: people and situations showing you how you give and receive love. Take notes. This is a time to consider if you have been providing the right energy that will foster supportive harmonious relationships and if you’ve been poured into as well from the other end. This is an optimal opportunity to allow old dynamics to shed and transform into beneficial supportive partnerships but also to call in new community and relationships that you desire. Prepare for the truth to be revealed to you and don’t run from it. Lead with your heart. You’ll know what to do. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941378.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Virgo: The Sun <br /></strong><br />You are the center of your own universe and the source of all abundance, so move like it. This is your glow up season where all eyes are on you, but, most importantly, you are shining on yourself like no other. This period is going to bring visibility, praise, recognition, joy, creative expansion, orgasms, and the successful results of doing the inner work and embodying your highest timeline. The ancestors are celebrating you and clearing the path so you are free to live your best life and, through example, show others that they can do it, too. Trust that so much is coming your way, and you will be perpetually making room for it all. You deserve it all.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941379.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Libra: 9 of Pentacles<br /></strong><br />Luxury is your birthright. Don’t you forget it! There are so many ways that you will choose to indulge in luxury this season that it becomes the baseline and the standard of your reality. Your ancestors are reminding you where you come from and how to shift struggle and turn it into gold. Your ability to generate abundance will be evident by the way you glow and live your life. You’ve cultivated this season of abundance through discipline, healing, and divine timing, so enjoy it! Don’t shrink your shine or apologize for your success or for choosing joy over suffering. Dress well, move with grace, and own your softness as power. You are walking proof that self-worth attracts everything.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941401.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Every year, when Venus enters Scorpio, we dive headfirst into our passions. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio is an intense water sign</a> that instantly knows what it wants. The intuition of Scorpio is fire, leading us to align with those at our level by forming close relationships with them. When Venus is in Scorpio, the romantic planet becomes slightly more seductive and goes after what it wants, encouraging our affections to reach a feverish pitch. We do not settle for anything less than we deserve, as we know to shoot for the stars and beyond. The caveat is that we can get competitive, since our ambitions take center stage. Calming this part of ourselves will be challenging — especially with this season’s cosmic line-up. <br /><br /><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-scorpio-2024-meaning-effects"">Venus in Scorpio</a> is adding to the swampiness of the next several weeks. Since we are already in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio season</a>, the connection to Mercury retrograde in Scorpio, Jupiter retrograde in Cancer, and Saturn and Neptune retrograde in Pisces is tapping into our emotions and the past. It’ll be hard to escape the present ramifications of our former decisions, urging us to be more reflective. As a result, we may spend time alone, ruminating over our choices and trying to forge a new path forward. The one positive thing is that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/water-signs-zodiac-traits-explained"">the signs in the water element</a> keep us going; however, most planets are retrograde, making us feel like we are paddling against the current flow of energy. The best way to handle the vibe is to stop working hard relentlessly for the future and to be present. Water can heal and soothe our pain if we let it.</p>



<p>There could be moments of enlightenment during Venus’s stint in Scorpio. Having a discerning eye during the New Moon in Scorpio on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">November</a> 20 urges us to break free from situations and relationships holding us back. Releasing people, whether by unfollowing them on social media or keeping a safe distance, will make us lighter. Carrying around resentments and jealousies isn’t emotionally healthy, so it’s ideal to do a cleansing to ensure we can mend our hearts. Remember, this may take a while. There is no timeline for recovery. Everyone is different and does what works with their own methods. <br /><br />Watch out for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-support-partner-with-ptsd"">trauma bonding</a> at this time because we might align with those going through parallel experiences. Although the instant reaction is to assume that they are our spiritual counterpart, the relationship will shift when Mercury turns direct on November 29 and Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30 (these dates are markers for specific cycles’ ending). The lesson is to maintain boundaries and not to blur lines. Staying in our lanes is advisable to ensure we do not become upset when the rapport dissipates. Therefore, it’s best to discuss our baggage with a therapist, close friends, or family members who will be by our side through thick and thin. <br /><br />Words of wisdom: From November 6 to 30, while Venus is swimming in the deep end of the ocean in the enigmatic and provocative sign of Scorpio, make sure to do something nice for yourself. Whether buying a cute pair of shoes, driving to the countryside to bask in the beautiful foliage, or reading an exciting book. The celestial waves of Venus in Scorpio are bringing change, which means putting ourselves first. More importantly, becoming obsessed with ourselves because we are fabulous in our own unique ways.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940839.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>I caught up with celebrity and editorial makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/katiejanehughes/?hl=en"">Katie Jane Hughes</a> in L.A. while she was in glam-tour mode with Dua Lipa, and we went deep on career longevity, the internet’s role in her rise, and why her namesake line, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/katie-jane-hughes-hyper-shine-high-lite-kit-review"">KJH Brand</a>, is built to teach—not just “trend.”</p>



<p>When I asked how posting changed her bookings, Katie didn’t hesitate. Early on, when legacy shoots felt out of reach, she treated her feed like a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/02/224876/katie-jane-hughes-makeup-artist-instagram-interview"">living portfolio</a>. “My page became my editorial,” she told me, a place to set her own brief, show technique, and get discovered by celebrity teams. She still swears by artists sharing work on themselves; it demystifies the process for clients and doubles as a lookbook they can point to on set.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Instagram became my editorial.”</p><cite>kATIE JANE HUGHES</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2>Teaching-first beauty (and the case against heavy primer)</h2>



<p>If you follow Katie, you know the mantra: <strong>skin should look like skin</strong>, even with coverage and color. One of my favorite corrections she made to my routine is simple brushwork: <strong>press and tap</strong> product in instead of swiping it around. And while she’s not anti-primer, Katie believes “priming starts with skincare,” emphasizing the importance of cleanser, moisturizer, and smart layering over extra steps.</p>



<h2>Why she built KJH Brand</h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940847.jpg?width=854&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=427%3A512"" /></figure></div>



<p>I asked what pushed her to create a line when her career was already thriving. Her answer: <strong>Education</strong>. Every formula is designed to be teachable and multi-use, with adjustable application for different skin types. Her <a href=""https://kjhbrand.com/products/soft-smudge-lip-cheek?variant=49496738627895"">Soft Smudge Blush</a> (I love the shade Soft Raisin) took years to perfect—it gives that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/blur-makeup-trend-products"">diffused, powdery-meets-creamy payoff</a> that stays put and doubles on lips with a balm or serum. She also let me play with <strong>Precision</strong> micro-contour crayons for underpainting eyes and lips, plus a <strong>clear brow gel</strong> that she describes, simply, as “a damn good brow gel”, no gimmicks, just hold and flexibility.</p>



<h2>Inclusive shade thinking, from deep to fair</h2>



<p>We talked shade development, and I loved her philosophy: <strong>start deeper and work to fair</strong>. “If it works on melanated complexions, you can always shear it down,” Katie said, pushing brands to build equity into product design—not tack it on at the end. Her PD process includes testing across tones and tapping makeup artists of color on the core team.</p>



<h2>Retail dreams, startup reality</h2>



<p>KJH Brand is self-funded so far, and Katie’s considering <strong>Sephora</strong> for 2026—whether to debut on a smaller discovery shelf or go big with a full bay that tells the brand story. It’s thrilling and terrifying, she admitted; beauty ops mean long lead times, lots of POs, and real capital discipline. Her husband, <strong>Tarek</strong>, runs the finance side. As founders, they’re learning to set boundaries, take 15-minute walks, and communicate like a true startup.</p>





<h2>Getting over color fear</h2>



<p>Katie wants more of us playing with color—<strong>starting small</strong>. Try a mossy green or rust liner, a single wash of berry on the lid, or a taupe-y contour crayon as a subtle lip overliner (“aim for your <em>volume</em> lip line, not just the pigmented border”). And her reminder I cosign: it’s makeup. It washes off.</p>



<h2>What’s exciting her right now</h2>



<p>We swapped innovation picks during our chat. On the list: the new <strong><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/yummy-skin-liquid-blurring-balm-mattifying-setting-spray-P516894"">Danessa Myricks</a></strong><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/yummy-skin-liquid-blurring-balm-mattifying-setting-spray-P516894""> blurring setting spray</a> that leaves a soft-focus finish; <strong><a href=""https://www.glossier.com/products/boy-brow-arch?&amp;variant=45591166517493"">Glossier’s</a></strong><a href=""https://www.glossier.com/products/boy-brow-arch?&amp;variant=45591166517493""> ultra-precise brow pencil</a> with a built-in sharpener; <strong><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/yeux-paint-liquid-eyeshadow-liner-P515452"">Violette_FR’s</a></strong><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/yeux-paint-liquid-eyeshadow-liner-P515452""> buildable eye paints</a> (that royal-blue moment!); <strong><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/fara-homidi-essential-face-compact-refillable-concealer-and-foundation-P511747"">Fara Homidi’s</a></strong><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/fara-homidi-essential-face-compact-refillable-concealer-and-foundation-P511747""> dual-finish concealer/balm compact</a> for custom coverage; and a <strong><a href=""https://www.dermstore.com/p/is-clinical-reparative-moisture-emulsion/11287899/"">new reparative moisturizer from iS Clinical</a></strong> that makes every base sit better.</p>







<p>When I asked when she feels most beautiful, Katie said it’s when she has an hour to herself to create something bold and share it with her community. It tracks: the career, the content, the company—<strong>teach, experiment, include</strong>, and make skin look like skin.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941254.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Amidst the planetary changes this week, a Supermoon illuminates the sky on November 5. The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/full-moon-names-spiritual-meaning"">Super Full Beaver Moon</a> in Taurus is the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/super-harvest-moon-in-aries-horoscope-october-2025"">second Supermoon of the year</a>, making the Moon appear bigger and brighter than usual, since it’s hanging closer to our planet than usual. At the same time, the Southern and Northern Taurid meteor showers peak, allowing us to wish upon a star — also, an auspicious moment to manifest our dreams for the future. This is a magical time to think about our heartfelt sentiments and transcend at our own pace.<br /><br />The Full Moon in Taurus connects with the Nodes of Destiny on the Pisces and Virgo lunar axis, which means that fate is at hand and our decisions will affect our future in many ways, particularly our love lives. If a relationship needs leveling up or is ending, this might be the time to commit to a direction we wish to take. On the other hand, we might meet people who will play an essential role in our future, so hop on the dating apps or ask a friend for a set-up to connect with someone special.</p>



<p>The day before and after the Supermoon, Mars is quite busy. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">The “warrior planet” moves into Sagittarius</a> on November 4, aspecting Uranus retrograde in Gemini the same day. We’ll show off our unique nature and visions on the 4th, which we want to manifest into reality on the 6th, when Mars and Pluto in Aquarius link up. As a result, our rizz will intensify, urging us to go for who or what makes us happy. <br /><br />Venus changes signs from Libra to Scorpio on November 6, deepening our lust for life and others. This planetary placement encourages us to dive headfirst into romance without looking back. With the minor connections Venus is making to Uranus and Neptune retrograde on the 6th, we might be apt to be consumed with love. Remember that Mercury retrograde commences on the 9th, but we are still in the pre-retrograde zone, so an ex could come back and begin to charm us. Regardless of what happens, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">the cosmos are setting the stage for warmth and tenderness</a>.</p>



<p>Even though this is a super chill and calm Full Moon, the energy can be excitable and erratic for most of us, due to the proximity of the Moon to the Earth. Therefore, we should do grounding activities such as connecting to the Earth. Feeling our senses fill our bodies, savoring tastes, recognizing the sense of touching luxurious fabrics, and hearing relaxing sounds to make us feel calmer. We will be able to find a moment of calm in the world. Self-care is also a key theme, so booking the facial that has been on our wish list is vital. Take a long autumnal walk in the park. Treating ourselves is a suggestible act — get the fancy latte in the morning and don’t feel guilty about the cost. Do you!<br /><br />Another aspect of this lunation is to embrace fun and pleasure. The Full Moon in Taurus brings a “bring and eat, drink, and be merry” vibe, heightening our desire for indulgence. As a result, we should step into the vitality of life and embrace the comforts surrounding us by listening to good music, being with positive and uplifting pals, enjoying a fantastic spread of food, and unapologetically tapping into our hedonistic passions. All of the wonderful merriments of life are at our fingertips, which is why we should lean into them. Be present and fall into <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/11/128990/supermoon-november-2016-beaver-full-moon-rituals"">the lovely energy of the Supermoon</a>. </p>



<p>The intoxicating energy of the Supermoon will lead us to our most genuine sentiments and yearnings. Once we’ve tasted sweetness, our thirst for more may increase. The expectations we have for the future may go beyond what we get — but in the end, we will be delighted with what we receive. We can’t always get what we want (exceptionally high); however, we will come close enough to satisfy our needs and attain greatness the following day. The universe gives us more than we ever hoped, so don’t fuss and drink it up. Let the optimism flow. Do not take anything or anyone for granted — show them you care.</p>

<p>The holidays have arrived early at Sephora, and by that, we mean that the retailer’s highly anticipated savings event is back for 2025. Whether you’re eyeing the bevy of sparkly gift sets or looking to repurchase your favorite <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nocturnal-polar-night-serum-review"">luxe serum</a>, Sephora’s <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/beauty/savings-event"">Holiday Savings Event</a> is the time to do just that.</p>



<p>Anyone who’s shopped Sephora’s sales before knows the rules, but if you’re new here, this is the run-down: Depending on your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/05/9843677/sephora-beauty-insider-cash-rewards-program-update-2020"">Beauty Insider membership tier</a> (which goes from Insider, VIB, and Rouge, depending on how much you spend annually), you can get <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/beauty/savings-event"">10, 15, or 20% off</a>, respectively. The sale is officially open to the public as of November 4, and <em>all</em> tiers have until November 10 to use the promo code <strong>EVERYTHING</strong> at checkout, which automatically applies the discount according to your membership tier. (Regardless of tier, all Beauty Insider levels can take 30% off all Sephora Collection products from October 31 to November 10, no code needed.) </p>



<p>As with previous years, there’s some fine print to keep in mind as you plan your Sephora haul: Shoppers are limited to two Dyson items (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dyson-hairstyling-tools-worth-it-review"">choose wisely</a>), three <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-flexfusion-styler-review"">Shark Beauty</a> items, three The Ordinary products, and three Nutrafol items per transaction. MAC Cosmetics VIVA GLAM products, in-store services, previous purchases, and gift cards are also not eligible for a discount. But, a <em>major</em> perk of Sephora’s holiday savings event: Snapping up gift sets at a discount.</p>



<p>Now that you have the rules of the road, onto the fun part: Keep scrolling for the most worth-it items to snag during the sale.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/glam-flexstyle-for-straight-to-wavy-hair-in-french-gold-P519274"">Shark Glam™ Hot Tool Air Styling &amp; Drying System</a>, $449</h2>

<p>We<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-flexfusion-styler-review""> reviewed Shark’s FlexFusion</a> last year, and it surpassed our expectations with flying colors. This year, we’re eyeing the Glam —Shark’s latest innovation, which includes curling barrels, a smoothing brush, finishing tool, straightener, and a concentrator nozzle to achieve a variety of looks.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/lip-cheat-lip-liner-P433516?skuId=2765618"">Charlotte Tilbury Lip Cheat Lip Liner</a>, $26</h2>

<p>Charlotte Tilbury’s iconic Lip Cheat pencils are always a good idea to stock up on — especially if you can nab them at a discount. From the iconic Pillow Talk rosy nude to rich reds, this makeup artist-favorite liner is a lip combo essential.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/patrick-ta-major-headlines-cream-powder-blush-duo-P458747"">Patrick Ta Major Headlines Double-Take Crème &amp; Powder Blush Duo</a>, $38</h2>

<p>Celebrity makeup artist Patrick Ta’s blushes are still among Sephora’s bestsellers, and with more shade duos than ever, don’t miss out on restocking (or picking up a fresh shade for fall) at a rare discount.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/glazing-milk-P519160?skuId=2898419"">Rhode Glazing Milk</a>, $32</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940176.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>Rhode entered Sephora doors this year, and you know what that means: All your dewy skincare essentials are available to shop during the Holiday Savings Event for the first time ever. If you can only choose one product, make it the Glazing Milk essence, which is perfect for adding extra hydration as the weather cools down.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/advent-calendar-us-P518496?skuId=2907772"">Sephora Collection Advent Calendar</a>, $55</h2>

<p>This blockbuster advent calendar by Sephora Collection is 30% off during the entire duration of the Holiday Savings Event, bringing the price tag down to $38.50. With a value of $163.50 in products, this is a serious steal that we predict won’t stay in stock for long.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/lightwork-vii-the-freedom-makeup-palette-P518415"">Danessa Myricks Beauty LIGHTWORK VII The Freedom Makeup Palette</a>, $128</h2>

<p>If we had a beauty crystal ball, we would forecast that this Danessa palette will be quite the hot commodity for holiday makeup looks this season. Create endless dazzling looks using the entire assortment, or pop out each six-pan palette, remove the magnetic logo mirror in the center, and take it on the go.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/P517217"">LORE Disfruta Eau de Parfum</a>, $88</h2>

<p>If you love niche, luxury fragrance, here’s a name you’ve probably never heard of — for now. From the brains of Melanie Bender (whose resume includes executive roles at Rhode, Versed, and Merit) and Joe Cloyes and Greg Gonzalez (founders of Youth To The People) comes Lore. The collection of four hyper-sensorial, unique fragrances ranges from fruity with a hint of smoky mezcal (Disfruta, seen here) to <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/lovely-a-little-twisted-eau-de-parfum-P517242?skuId=2888469&amp;icid2=products%20grid:p517242:product"">Lovely And A Little Twisted</a>, a milky rose that’s utterly addictive. Best of all: They all clock in at $88 for a full-size bottle — easily half of comparable designer brands — and are fair game during the sale. </p>



<h2 id=""modal2Title""><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/summer-fridays-the-holiday-trio-set-hot-coco-toasted-marshmallow-lbb-mini-jlm-P518536?skuId=2902054&amp;icid2=products%20grid:p518536:product"">Summer Fridays The Holiday Trio Set</a>, $48</h2>

<p>There is stiff competition in the world of tinted lip butters, balms, and treatments — but the Summer Fridays one continues to stand out from its competition time and time again. This cozy set includes two holiday-exclusive flavors (Toasted Marshmallow and Hot Cocoa) alongside a travel-size Jet Lag Mask for skin-quenching hydration.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/big-bitty-setting-spray-superstars-P518405"">ONE/SIZE On ‘Til Dawn Mattifying Waterproof Setting Spray Big &amp; Bitty Duo</a>, $36</h2>

<p>Patrick Starrr’s ONE/SIZE setting spray is goated for a reason: Nothing works better to lock in makeup all day long with a soft matte finish. This holiday set is only $2 more than the full-size, but includes a mini for those all-important touchups. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/underpainting-face-highlight-contour-palette-P516830"">m.ph Underpainting Face Highlight &amp; Contour Palette</a>, $64</h2>

<p>This time last year, celebrity makeup artist Mary Phillips’ brand, m.ph, was still waiting in the wings. This year, however, is a different story. The versatile complexion palette is already a Sephora bestseller, and thanks to a recent restock, you can snag yours at a discount during the sale. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941082.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>It’s been nearly two years since the action planet <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2023"">Mars has orbited Sagittarius</a>, making this year’s comeback memorable. In the midst of several retrogrades (Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), we can rely on Mars in Sagittarius to serve as the energetic light we need to get us through the muddiness of fall <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">from November</a> 4 to December 15.</p>



<p>Let’s be real, Mars in Sagittarius can get a little messy. The reason is that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-zodiac-sign-traits-characteristics"">Sagittarius is an impulsive sign</a> that is super reactive and doesn’t focus on the consequences of their actions. When the action planet Mars is fired up in Sagittarius, it can create a mountain out of a molehill, as the archer’s energy can push limits and fight to prove a point for the sake of their bravado — even if no one is questioning their abilities and knowledge. We must be careful because we could shoot an arrow from our arsenal without considering where it lands (or others can do this to us). The reckless attitude and behavior can intensify existing matters. </p>



<p>Our weapons of choice will be words. Mars in Sagittarius has a tendency not to think before speaking. The condition is called “putting our foot in our mouths.” As you know, hearing the cold, hard truth can be unpleasant, making shooting from the hip the worst possible way to upset others. Being that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-aries-pisces-march-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrograde</a> commences on November 9 and lasts until November 29, we should all take cover from miscommunications and hapless interpretation of sentiments. If we don’t, arguments will intensify since we want to have the last word. PSA: Sometimes we don’t need to send the final zinger to win the battle. There is power and authority in silence when people are popping off. </p>



<p>Debating the past is another core theme of Mars’s current journey in Sagittarius. Our memories are based on our personal feelings, which others might not align with someone else’s — which is okay. We have different experiences as humans and should find a common ground to understand each other. Regardless of how we perceive our past, being around those who nurture our hearts with kindness and aim to understand us is pivotal. So, if anyone begins to gaslight us, we should put them on ice and surround ourselves with loving people. Compassion goes a long way in the next several weeks. </p>



<p>Although the transit of Mars in Sagittarius is a time of action, we may be stuck in the mud. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars’s interaction with the other planets</a> serves up indecision instead of certainty. The harsh aspect Mars makes to Neptune retrograde in Pisces on December 14 will make us unsure about how we want to proceed in relationships, work projects, and the next steps in our lives. The only way to deal with this energy is to be calm and meditate on our plans — even if we have the urge to power through. Stopping to smell the roses offers perspective to assess what is essential and what we desire. Taking the opposite road is the equivalent of trying to make “fetch” happen — the trend from <em>Mean Girls</em> that never caught on.</p>



<p>If we put our darts aside by finding the right ways to express ourselves and proceed with empathy — not just for others, but for ourselves — we can make the best of the situation. In a world full of chaos, we can choose to be good and tender. Perhaps Neptune retrograde will soften up the fierce energy of Mars in Sagittarius — here’s hoping for that! </p>



<h2>Important Dates: </h2>



<p><strong>November 4:</strong> Mars enters Sagittarius, adding boldness and confidence to our aura. <br /><br /><strong>November 4:</strong> Mars in Sagittarius opposes Uranus retrograde in Gemini, bringing breakthroughs to the world and our lives.<br /><br /><strong>November 6:</strong> Mars in Sagittarius sextiles Pluto in Aquarius, intensifying matters due to control issues.<br /><br /><strong>November 12:</strong> Mars and Mercury retrograde in Sagittarius form a conjunction, making us question the direction we are heading in.<br /><br /><strong>November 24:</strong> Mars in Sagittarius squares the Nodes of Destiny, urging us to speak up and take a stand for our beliefs.<br /><br /><strong>December 8:</strong> Mars in Sagittarius creates a fraught aspect with Saturn retrograde in Pisces, pushing us to be pragmatic and realistic.<br /><br /><strong>December 14:</strong> Mars in Sagittarius connects with Neptune retrograde in Pisces, highlighting our uncertainty and confusion. Our vitality and energy will be low, so take it easy.</p>
