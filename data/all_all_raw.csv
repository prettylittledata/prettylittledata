<p>Water is the foundation of life. It shapes landscapes, regulates climates, and sustains every living organism. Yet on the only known inhabited planet, this essential resource faces a growing crisis: although 70% of Earth's surface is covered by water, less than 1% is actually available for human use. Most of it is consumed by agriculture and industry, while in households, activities like bathing and flushing use vast amounts of drinking water for non-essential purposes. The bathroom, therefore, has become a key space for innovation, where technology and design can help redefine how we use and reuse this vital element.</p>",

These spaces have an unforgettable aroma and are dark save for the occasional ray of light.</p>",

<h4><strong>AI can automate frameworks, but not their interpretation or meaning.</strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Minimal composition of neutral-coloured material samples arranged in geometric blocks on a soft beige background, suggesting structure, relationships and design frameworks."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*b8DzJdpcGkM2SfZcyrbI2Q.jpeg"" /></figure><p>AI can now generate design artefacts in seconds. It can fill in a Value Proposition Canvas, a journey map, or a jobs-to-be-done structure with impressive speed and coherence. For designers and other professionals, this raises an uncomfortable question: if machines can apply the tools of our disciplines, where does that leave human expertise?</p><p>The answer lies not in what AI can produce, but in what humans can <em>decide</em>. The real transformation is not about replacing expertise, but about separating the visible outputs of design and strategy from the judgement that gives those outputs meaning. The part of professional work being automated is not the expertise itself. It is the formatting. The model doesn’t replace human judgement; it replicates its surface patterns.</p><p>This distinction matters because in many disciplines, frameworks — including design systems, journey maps and strategy canvases — have gradually become confused with expertise. In reality, frameworks were never the work. They were simply a way to show the thinking behind the work.</p><blockquote>A canvas, a storyboard, a strategic quadrant or a journey map is a visible output of reasoning. It is not the reasoning itself.</blockquote><p>Designers and professionals are trusted not because they can draw boxes in the correct configuration, but because they can decide what those boxes should mean in this particular context, and why certain trade-offs deserve priority.</p><p>This becomes especially clear in a phrase that appears frequently in AI technical discussions: “once you have a knowledge graph.” It sounds like a neutral implementation detail, but it conceals something fundamental. A knowledge-graph structure implies that the relevant concepts have already been chosen, that the relationships between them have already been defined, and that the worldview has already been interpreted. The graph does not emerge automatically from data. It is the result of decisions about relevance and meaning. In other words, the interpretive step — the step that decides what something really means — is already done by humans before the model can do anything intelligent with the structure.</p><p>Once meaning is structured, AI can format it into any template shape you like: a canvas, a SWOT, a JTBD card, a “north star” narrative or a product-positioning document. These are all just containers for meaning. The automation is real. And designers and professionals who ignore these new capabilities will eventually feel pressure from those who adopt them. But the layer that becomes automated is not the layer where value originates. It is the layer where value becomes visible.</p><p>This leads to a larger shift taking place across design and the professions more broadly. The next decade is unlikely to be defined by whether AI can perform technical tasks. It is already clear that it can. The future of work will be shaped by where professional value migrates in response. Designers and professionals who have defined themselves primarily by their ability to apply tools will see their contribution begin to shrink, not because they are being replaced by machines, but because the level of work they have specialised in is now becoming commoditised.</p><p>Where value increases is in the upstream layer: the ability to define the context, shape the problem, discern what matters and design the meaning architecture within which decisions will operate. In product development, for instance, the meaning architecture is not the journey map or the sprint cadence itself, but the decision to prioritise long-term ethical design over short-term growth, or to define ‘customer value’ in a way that includes accessibility and inclusion. These are structural choices about what the organisation believes to be valuable, and they shape every subsequent framework or metric that follows.</p><p>These are not technical choices; they are leadership ones. And because AI accelerates the downstream tasks so dramatically, the upstream space becomes more valuable. The gravitational pull of automation is downward toward execution. The centre of human advantage moves upward toward sensemaking.</p><p>In reality, the relationship between AI and human professionals is less a division of labour than a feedback loop. Automated outputs can expose hidden assumptions or new correlations, prompting humans to revisit and refine the structures of meaning themselves. The speed of automation accelerates the human capacity for interpretation by providing more “first drafts” to react to, question and evolve. In this sense, AI doesn’t just apply frameworks faster — it multiplies the opportunities for deeper sensemaking.</p><p>This is why, in strategic practice, the deepest leverage is not in the artefacts themselves but in the operating logic behind them. For example, in customer-centric strategy work, it is not the journey map or the value-proposition template that drives transformation, but the underlying ontology of the business. Frameworks such as the Customer Centricity Strategy Framework, used in strategic design practice, operate at this level, defining how customer value is understood, related and governed. This is the layer where meaning lives.</p><p>Deciding what matters is not only a rational act but also a deeply human one. It involves reading the emotional climate of an organisation, understanding unspoken cultural dynamics, and sensing how ideas will land with people. Frameworks may help clarify choices, but it is empathy, discretion and moral awareness that allow those choices to take root. The human advantage lies not only in deciding what matters, but in helping others believe in and act on it.</p><figure><img alt=""A person’s hand arranges natural and crafted materials — wood, ceramic, shells, and small objects — on a marble surface beside a cup of tea, suggesting human curation, reflection, and creativity."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*S48RRgrQ5v4gyW_93HEkZQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Human sensemaking in action — arranging, selecting and interpreting elements to create coherence and meaning.</figcaption></figure><p>So the real future-of-work question is not “Will AI replace me?” The more accurate question is: “At what level am I operating?” If your identity is tied to applying templates, AI will apply them faster. If your identity is tied to interpreting reality, your value not only remains, it increases. Designers and professionals do not become obsolete because their tools become automated. They become obsolete when they equate their professional identity with the tools.</p><p>AI can apply any framework. But only humans can decide what matters. The future of work will not be defined by competition between human and machine capability, but by the reallocation of value — from tool application to meaning architecture — and that is where real transformation in organisations is most likely to happen next.</p><p><em>For further reading on the deeper architecture of customer-centric meaning, see</em> <strong><em>Designing Customer Experiences with Soul: How to Build Products, Services and Brands that People Genuinely Love</em></strong>, <em>which explores the ontology behind customer value and strategic coherence.</em></p><h4><strong>Author</strong></h4><p>Simon Robinson is CEO (Worldwide) of Holonomics and a global thought leader on customer experience, systems thinking and strategic transformation.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=cb6e2dfecf6d"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-new-professional-core-the-future-of-work-is-sensemaking-cb6e2dfecf6d"">The future of work is sensemaking</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>When you can build a working prototype in an afternoon, the question is no longer <em>can you make it</em> — it’s <em>should you build it</em>, and <em>what should you build</em>.</h4><figure><img alt=""Central target with four coral hands reaching toward it, connected by teal circuit board lines and technology icons"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ja7QeYOYZ4XrSSk5eA3opw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Most founders and teams struggle with those questions, not because they lack conviction, but because they test that conviction too late. Resources get committed before customer needs are validated. Confirmation bias filters what gets heard. They often fall in love with solutions before fully understanding the problems they need to solve.</p><p>AI-accelerated development affects everyone — from solo founders building alone to small startup teams to larger software organizations at scaleups and enterprises. Whether you’re a team of one or one hundred, the challenge is the same: deciding what deserves to exist.</p><p>The CHAOS Report (Standish Group, 2020) indicates that more than two-thirds of software projects fail to meet their intended outcomes. While execution failures play a role, the problems often begin earlier — in the discovery phase. A focus on delivery velocity has replaced the judgment time needed to uncover what truly matters.</p><h3>Co-Invention: Redesigning Discovery</h3><p>I had spent six weeks conducting discovery and design on an AI-powered toolkit to accelerate product discovery when I came across Ajay Agrawal’s YouTube interview, &quot;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhfpHwcrx6c"">The AI Economist: The Skill You Need to Stay Employed in the Age of AI</a>&quot; (Full interview is 1 hour and 5 minutes). I was researching AI capabilities for the toolkit when his insight stopped me in my tracks. In my experience, software teams often skipped proper discovery, claiming they didn’t have time. I saw AI as the solution to a productivity problem: automate tasks, integrate workflows, and make discovery faster so software teams would have fewer excuses not to do it properly.</p><p>In their book <em>Power and Prediction</em>, Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb (2022) describe what happened when factories first adopted electricity. Manufacturers replaced steam engines with electric motors, but retained the same layout — one large motor, complex belts and pulleys, and machines clustered around a central power source. Productivity barely improved. The breakthrough came when they redesigned around electricity’s potential: machines could go anywhere, organized by workflow rather than power source.</p><p>This is what they call co-invention: the new technology is only part of the solution. The real value lies in inventing complementary systems, processes, and organizational structures that leverage the technology's strengths.</p><p>Today we’re making the same mistake with AI — bolting it onto existing workflows, increasing speed without improving outcomes. An effective AI-human partnership requires co-inventing new systems that leverage the strengths of each. The processes that guide discovery need fundamental redesign, not around speed, but around judgment.</p><p>Speed without judgment means building the wrong things faster.</p><h3>Prediction vs Judgment</h3><p>Agrawal’s deeper insight reframed my thinking. In the human-AI partnership, AI makes predictions radically faster — filling in missing information, recognizing patterns, generating options, and forecasting outcomes. What remains scarce is judgment: the ability to interpret meaning, weigh trade-offs, and decide what’s worth pursuing.</p><p><a href=""https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxkhxVv155CAE29w9F2Dal4uOtXrRKFuEZ?si=iZTAjfaqrrJrD4o2""><strong><em>Watch economist Ajay Agrawal explain this distinction</em></strong><em>(1 minute)</em></a></p><p>Decision-making is the interplay of prediction and judgment. AI handles what is likely to happen. Humans decide what should be done about it.</p><blockquote><strong>“AI handles what is likely to happen. Humans decide what should be done about it.”</strong></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Diagram showing AI prediction capabilities (pattern recognition, synthesis, generating options) on the left converging with human judgment capabilities (determining purpose, interpreting meaning, weighing tradeoffs) on the right into decision-making at the center"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/784/1*_uav4SS4tk8EzfaiTJkeQQ.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>In discovery, this plays out constantly. AI can analyze customer-interview transcripts and identify patterns across dozens of conversations — that’s prediction. But we must decide whether those patterns represent real problems worth solving or simply interesting noise — that’s judgment.</p><p>AI can forecast which features might increase engagement — that’s prediction. Only humans can decide how well they align with customers’ needs and the product’s vision, purpose and principles — that’s judgment.</p><p>Brandon Harwood (2025) describes this distinction in his framework for AI-powered product design, noting that specific tasks must remain human-centric due to the need for judgment, intuition, and emotional intelligence. What AI accelerates is synthesis; what humans provide is meaning-making.</p><p>Judgment develops by making decisions under uncertainty and owning the consequences. When you pursue an opportunity based on limited evidence, ship it, and learn it was the wrong bet, that failure can grow your judgment. When you kill a beloved idea because evidence doesn’t support it and that decision proves correct, that success strengthens your judgment. Learning comes from the whole cycle: decide → act → observe → reflect.</p><p>Discovery judgment is the practice of developing judgment about what deserves to exist. It’s not a single activity but a set of practices: identifying opportunities, talking to customers about their needs, mapping assumptions about what would make a solution valuable, testing those assumptions with minimal investment, and deciding when evidence is strong enough to commit resources.</p><p>Sinek’s (2009) Golden Circle, explored in <em>Start with Why</em> and his TED Talk <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action"">“How Great Leaders Inspire Action”</a>, provides a valuable lens for understanding why judgment remains a human trait. The Golden Circle shows that inspiring action starts with <em>why</em> — purpose and belief — then moves to <em>how</em>, and finally <em>what</em> you produce. This order is often reversed, starting with what or how to build.</p><p>AI can handle the how and even suggest the what. Only humans can determine the why, which makes it worthwhile to build. Judgment is the capacity to reason about purpose, meaning, and value — capabilities that belong uniquely to us.</p><h3>Cross-Functional Discovery Judgment</h3><p>If discovery judgment is scarce, everyone involved in bringing software to market needs to develop it. Discovery emerges from judgment calls across multiple perspectives — technical feasibility, user needs, market fit, operational constraints, and strategy.</p><p>Solo founders and small teams make all these judgment calls themselves, constantly switching between perspectives. You’re the product person AND the engineer AND the designer — often feeling overwhelmed by the need to think across domains that don’t come naturally.</p><p>Larger teams distribute these perspectives across various roles, including product managers, engineers, designers, user researchers, and customer success. When these perspectives stay siloed, teams consistently build the wrong things. The “that’s not my job” mindset creates blind spots that AI acceleration only amplifies.</p><p>Tutti Taygerly (2020) learned this at Facebook: true collaboration isn’t about stakeholders handing work to each other — it’s about establishing trust and reasoning together from the start. Whether developing multi-perspective judgment as a solo founder or learning to reason together as a team, the principle is the same: cross-functional discovery judgment determines whether you build the right things.</p><p>For solo builders, this means developing judgment across domains you might not naturally think in — and creating systematic practices to compensate for working alone. For teams, it means different perspectives combining to form a better collective judgment. Over time, this capability compounds — solo founders develop intuition across multiple domains, and teams learn to reason together effectively.</p><p>For organizations, siloed discovery wastes insight and resources. For individuals working alone, a lack of systematic practices wastes time and money. For professionals staying narrow in their function, they become replaceable.</p><h3>Discovery as a Continuous Loop</h3><p>Discovery isn’t a pre-build phase — it’s a continuous practice that runs alongside delivery in an ongoing learning loop. Whether working solo or in teams, you discover what to build, deliver it, learn from what happens, and feed those insights back into the next round of discovery.</p><blockquote><strong>“Discovery isn’t a pre-build phase — it’s a continuous practice running alongside delivery in an ongoing learning loop.”</strong></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Circular diagram illustrating the continuous discovery-delivery-learning cycle with arrows showing how builders discover what to build, deliver it, learn from outcomes, and feed insights back into the next discovery cycle"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mgTX7TtZVj4kuIf97UINzQ.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>Discovery requires double-loop learning: not only asking Did this feature succeed? but examining the assumptions and reasoning behind it. Single-loop learning adjusts what you do; double-loop learning improves how you think about what to do.</p><p>Matthew Godfrey (2020) explores this in his work on the critical role of discovery, noting that the best product teams recognize that discovery and delivery should run concurrently and continuously, rather than as separate, sequential phases. This dual-track approach enables teams to address problems as they arise throughout the product development process.</p><p>As builders move through the discovery–delivery–learning loop, they’re not just refining the product — they’re refining their judgment. Each cycle sharpens your sense of what matters, which assumptions to test first, and what evidence is sufficient to act on. For teams, when this capability becomes shared, organizations learn to reason together — and that capacity compounds. For solo founders, systematic practice creates the judgment that teams might develop through diverse perspectives.</p><p>Solo founders often think they can skip systematic practices because “I am the product person AND the engineer AND the designer.” But that’s why the loop matters more — you need systematic practices to compensate for not having diverse perspectives catching your blind spots in real-time.</p><h3>Why This Matters Now</h3><p>When spreadsheets arrived, accounting firms hired fewer accountants — but those who remained became more strategic and better compensated. Arithmetic specialists moved on; judgment-oriented accountants thrived.</p><p>Software builders face the same shift. The ratio of value to people is changing dramatically. Your value isn’t in what AI can generate — code, mock-ups, or transcripts. It’s in developing discovery judgment: framing the right problems, interpreting evidence, weighing trade-offs, and helping others do the same.</p><p>I’ve seen this pattern repeatedly throughout my career. Teams would spend months building technically impressive solutions — only to discover they’d solved problems no customer actually had. The breakthrough came when we started mapping assumptions systematically before building—the same talented people, but different discovery judgment practices.</p><p>The market is splitting: professionals who use AI merely to execute faster versus those who use AI to amplify their judgment. The latter will become increasingly valuable precisely because AI can’t automate judgment. As Teixeira and Braga (2025) document in <em>The State of UX in 2025</em>, algorithms and automated tools are taking over execution tasks, making human judgment about purpose and meaning increasingly valuable.</p><p>For solo founders and small teams, this shift is even more pronounced. You can now build a complete product yourself using AI — but your judgment quality determines whether that product solves a real problem. The democratization of building capability means your competitive advantage is 100% in judgment, not execution speed.</p><p>If this all feels like too much change, that’s natural. AI is rewriting how we work; uncertainty is real; change feels relentless. But you’re already making judgment calls every day — deciding priorities, interpreting feedback, choosing when to proceed or pause. It isn’t new work; it’s becoming deliberate about the work that matters most.</p><blockquote><strong>“Speed and judgment used to be a trade-off. Now they’re both required — and only one can be automated.”</strong></blockquote><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>When AI makes building and delivering software easier, faster and more cost-effective, judgment becomes the scarce resource.</li><li>Judgment develops through decisions under uncertainty and reflection on results.</li><li>Cross-functional discovery judgment is the ability to interpret evidence and decide what deserves to be built and why — whether you’re building solo or as a team.</li><li>Discovery judgment is a continuous, double-loop learning practice, not a phase.</li><li>The software market is segmenting: those who focus on delivering faster versus those who compete on wisdom and strategic value.</li></ul><h3>References</h3><p>Agrawal, A., Gans, J., &amp; Goldfarb, A.

It’s as if the designers didn’t think about how real people would use it. That’s where product thinking comes in. It’s a way of designing that keeps the user at the forefront of the process, ensuring that their needs and challenges are fully understood before any solutions are created. In this post, I will share some of the values of product thinking I have learned over the years and share some tips on how to build good User Experience for the masses.</p><p>It is a process learned through continued learning to stay ahead, develop soft skills, and cultivate empathy for the user. I found following these principles incredibly useful and you can too use them to create products and experiences that truly serve your users.</p><h3>The value of product thinking</h3><p>A cornerstone of product thinking is the <strong>meticulous study of the </strong><a href=""https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-genai-changes-creative-work/""><strong>user’s journey</strong></a>. We meticulously map out the steps a user takes to achieve a specific goal, pinpointing their pain points and frustrations. By doing so, we can design products and services that are tailor-made to address these issues, creating a seamless and enjoyable user experience.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XxTRMd6CFuGb_r5kXP1YRA.png"" /><figcaption>Sample user journey map created by author.</figcaption></figure><p>Equally important is the consideration of the product’s value proposition. What unique benefits does the product offer to users? How does it solve their problems or improve their lives? By clearly defining the product’s value proposition, businesses can ensure that their product stands out in the market and that users can easily understand the value they will get from using it.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nm4dnjiV9gr47C-LB-pwqg.avif"" /><figcaption>Courtesy:<a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/value-proposition-canvas?srsltid=AfmBOoo2qjdc50y_zushQaKFUPTjYFRRp0z2zCcGJjmL_p3FPmwOiUob""> Interaction design Or</a>g</figcaption></figure><p>It’s also important to know that the aspects of Value prop and Mission statement of your product team can be very different. Here’s a clear breakdown of the <strong>differentiators</strong> between a <strong>Value Proposition</strong> and a <strong>Mission Statement</strong>, along with guidance on what kind of <strong>overlap</strong> is ideal and strategically beneficial.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/842/1*l1NG1p6czf8xvvxbIEvF4g.png"" /></figure><h3>Ideal Overlap Between the Two</h3><p>While distinct, a <strong>healthy overlap</strong> between the two ensures <strong>strategic alignment</strong> and <strong>authenticity</strong>. Here’s what that looks like:</p><ol><li><strong>Shared Purpose Language:</strong><br /> Both should express a consistent <em>why</em> — the company’s fundamental reason for existing. <br />Example: If the mission is “to simplify global communication,” the value proposition might echo that with “helping teams connect seamlessly across borders.”</li><li><strong>Cohesive Brand Identity:</strong><br /> The value proposition should <strong>flow naturally</strong> from the mission — the mission is <em>why</em> the company exists; the value proposition is <em>how</em> it creates value in the market.</li><li><strong>Emotional + Rational Blend:<br />Mission: evokes emotion and belief (“We exist to improve lives”). <br />Value Proposition</strong>: translates belief into tangible benefit (“We deliver affordable healthcare tools to everyone”).</li><li><strong>Internal and External Alignment:</strong><br /> Employees motivated by the mission are better able to deliver the value proposition authentically. This alignment ensures that marketing promises (value prop) match lived experience (mission).</li></ol><p>Prioritizing features according to user needs and business objectives is another key aspect of product thinking. Not all features are created equal, and it’s essential to allocate resources to those that will deliver the most value to users and align with the strategic goals of the business. Through comprehensive user research and analysis, we can make informed decisions about which features to prioritize and develop.</p><p>Finally, testing and iterating on designs is essential to ensure that products meet user needs. User testing provides valuable feedback that can be used to refine and improve the product. By iterating on designs based on user feedback, businesses can create products that are user-friendly, effective, and enjoyable to use.</p><h3>Building experience for the masses</h3><p>Crafting Inclusive User Experiences for the Masses:</p><p>Creating products and services that meet the needs of a wide range of users is a key part of building UX for everyone. This requires a holistic approach that includes <a href=""https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/blog/what-are-the-wcag-guidelines/"">accessibility</a>, inclusion, cultural sensitivity, and strong user research.</p><p>In the age of<a href=""https://www.figma.com/resource-library/mobile-first-design""> mobile-first technology</a>, it’s crucial to design with mobile in mind. This means creating interfaces that are easy to navigate and interact with on smaller screens. Intuitive touch gestures and clear calls to action are key to a great user experience, and thorough testing across devices and network conditions is essential to ensure your design works for everyone.</p><p>Accessibility and inclusivity are not just buzzwords; they are fundamental to great UX design. Making sure that people with disabilities — whether they have vision impairments, hearing loss, or other challenges — can use your product isn’t just the right thing to do, it’s also good for business. Using clear and simple language, providing text alternatives for non-text content, and making sure your product works with assistive technologies can help you reach a wider audience.</p><p>Cultural sensitivity is another key ingredient in the recipe for successful global UX. Understanding the unique expectations and preferences of diverse cultures is vital to crafting interfaces that resonate with users from different backgrounds. This may involve employing culturally appropriate colors, fonts, and imagery, as well as localizing content to cater to specific languages and cultural norms.</p><p>And finally, ongoing user research and testing are critical to a UX <a href=""https://www.netguru.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-ux-design"">designer’s success</a>. Surveys, interviews, and usability testing can provide valuable insights into what users need, want, and find frustrating. By involving users in the design process, we can create products that are truly user-centered and that provide a positive and inclusive experience for everyone.</p><h3>Keep learning to stay relevant</h3><p>The world of product design and development is always changing, with new technologies, trends, and user needs emerging all the time. To stay relevant and effective in this dynamic landscape, it’s important for designers to embrace a mindset of continuous learning and skill development. This means staying up-to-date with the latest industry knowledge, seeking out new opportunities for growth, and cultivating a diverse skill set that goes beyond technical expertise.</p><p><strong>You can use this GROW framework: </strong><br /> The word <em>GROW</em> captures the essence of continuous learning : it’s active, personal, and forward-looking. It reminds us that development isn’t about perfection; it’s about progress, curiosity, and courage. Each letter represents a mindset that fuels sustained growth in any field.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/713/1*JNMJcJxlBqmYhqAZSdWYfQ.png"" /><figcaption>GROW Framework</figcaption></figure><p>Among the most vital soft skills for UX designers is<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpnNsSyDw-g""> <strong>the art of active listening</strong></a>, the ability to truly hear what users are saying and comprehend their needs. It also involves the capacity to ask the right questions and seek clarity when needed. Empathy is another cornerstone of the UX designer’s skill set, enabling one to step into the user’s world, understand their emotions, and motivations. By cultivating empathy, we can craft products that are not only user-friendly but also a joy to use.</p><p>Effective communication is yet another vital soft skill for UX designers. This encompasses the ability to articulate one’s ideas clearly and concisely, as well as the capacity to listen to feedback and integrate it into one’s work. Time management, too, is of the essence. The skill to plan, prioritize, and meet deadlines is paramount for the successful completion of projects to the highest standard.</p><h3>Building your soft skills</h3><p>Soft skills are the interpersonal and communication abilities that are crucial for success in any job. They encompass active listening, <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/sympathy-vs-empathy-ux/"">empathy</a>, communication, and time management. In UX design, soft skills are indispensable for comprehending the user’s requirements and crafting products that fulfill those needs. By honing your soft skills, you can elevate your standing as a UX designer and enhance your prospects for triumph in the industry.</p><h3>Empathy for the win</h3><p>Empathy is a critical soft skill for UX designers. It allows us to understand the needs and desires of our users on a deeper level. By putting ourselves in the shoes of our users, we can create products and services that are truly user-centric.</p><p>We, as designers, can cultivate empathy through active listening, striving to comprehend the user’s perspective without bias. Engaging in user research, we can observe users in their natural settings, gaining valuable insights into their behaviors, needs, and challenges.</p><h3>This begs larger questions about AI’s impact on creativity</h3><p>The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought about significant advancements in various industries, including design. With the ability to process vast amounts of data and perform complex tasks, AI has the potential to greatly enhance the design process and improve the overall <a href=""https://adobe.design/stories/leading-design/designing-for-generative-ai-experiences"">user experience</a>.</p><p>However, as AI continues to evolve and become more integrated into the design process, it raises questions about its impact on creativity. Some argue that AI will replace human designers, making their skills and expertise obsolete. Others believe that AI will simply assist and enhance the work of designers, allowing them to focus on more creative and strategic aspects of the design process.</p><p>One of the main concerns is that AI may limit the diversity and uniqueness of designs. As AI algorithms are based on data and patterns, there is a risk that designs may become too similar and lack originality. This could result in a homogenization of design, stifling creativity and innovation.</p><p>On the other hand, AI has the potential to open up new possibilities and push the boundaries of design. By automating repetitive tasks and providing designers with insights and suggestions, AI can free up time for designers to <a href=""https://generalassemb.ly/blog/global-perspectives-ux-design-in-the-age-of-ai/"">explore new ideas</a> and experiment with different approaches. This can lead to more innovative and unique designs that would not have been possible without AI.</p><p>Another issue to consider is the ethical implications of AI in design. As AI algorithms are trained on existing data, there is a risk of perpetuating biases and discrimination in designs. It is crucial for designers to be aware of these biases and actively work towards creating inclusive and ethical designs.</p><p>In conclusion, the impact of AI on creativity in design is a complex and ongoing discussion. While AI has the potential to greatly enhance the design process, it is essential for designers to approach it with caution and continue to prioritize human creativity and empathy in their work. By understanding and harnessing the capabilities of AI, designers can create truly impactful and meaningful designs for the benefit of users.</p><p>So as you move forward, remember to <strong>SIP, DIP, and FLIP</strong>. <strong>SIP</strong> the world around you to take in its ideas, lessons, and experiences with curiosity. <strong>DIP</strong> into them deeply, let understanding soak through your thoughts, shaping your perspective and intent. And then, <strong>FLIP</strong> — turn insight into impact, thought into motion, and potential into progress. Because wisdom isn’t just about what we take in, but what we <em>do</em> with it.</p><p><strong>Reference Tools: <br /></strong>I am not paid to promote this.

We didn’t have a computer at home at the time so whenever I was around his, I would beg him to let me use it to play with MS Paint.</p><p>I was probably around 7 or 8, and my go-to artwork was a portrait of my him made with the spray tool — perfect to recreate his short, spiky hair and stubble — and I’d make his head ridiculously big and tease him about it. He still has one of these masterpiece in his desktop wallpapers rotation, I’m pretty sure.</p><p>I couldn’t draw much else with the mouse, nothing more complicated than a lopsided house and a tree, so I would ask him, knowing full well he wasn’t the artist in the family, to draw something for me; that day I asked for a dog. He tried his best, but what came up on the canvas was a misshapen thing — a kind of pig-dog hybrid that was so bad it had us laughing for a good while.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bAbEBu0_nMOmt2viK_-_2w.png"" /><figcaption>MS paint GUI circa 1999 (screenshot by author)</figcaption></figure><p>I wasn’t always sure why that random ugly dog had stayed with me for so long, but I see now it was a symbol of the connection my dad and I shared that day. This memory has resurfaced a few times now that there’s so much emphasis on AI image generators — these tools that can (sometimes, for now) create breathtaking art effortlessly yet leave me, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz0oQ0v0W10"">and many others</a>, wondering about their real purpose.</p><p>I’ve been thinking about what it would have been like if instead of just our best intention and some basic tools we would have had at our disposal Midjourney or something else that day, how my request to my dad would have been the same but the result much more different. The quality of the artwork itself is beside the point — the whole interaction and the unexpected moment between us it’s what would have been lost.</p><p>There’s been <a href=""https://philosophynow.org/issues/169/What_Makes_A_Work_Of_Art_Great"">countless debates</a> on what makes art <em>art</em>, why or why not AI outputs can or should be considered the <a href=""https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/08/is-art-generated-by-artificial-intelligence-real-art/"">same as human ones</a>. Now every month we have a new tool we can use, one of the latest being <a href=""https://openai.com/index/sora-2/"">Sora 2</a>, adding no value to the human experience while claiming to ‘democratise’ creativity — an overused phrase that does nothing, if not mistaking access for meaning.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Zz1vLggJm8LYsGkNulSnAA.png"" /><figcaption>Google Gemini UI (screenshot by author)</figcaption></figure><p>From a UX perspective, the process of AI image generation is as frictionless as it can be: type, click, wait and receive what you’ve asked for, perhaps refine it. As ever, the promise is accessibility by letting anyone create regardless of skill, but I would argue there’s a difference between democratising outcomes and democratising the creative process itself.</p><p>With these tools it’s like we’re giving everyone a printer instead of a paint brush, and by doing that, what we’re losing is the struggle and the lessons that come with it, so much so that creation doesn’t even feel like creating anymore.</p><p>When the outputs are automated we’re stripping away the messy, truly generative, experience where actual creativity lives.</p><p>I can’t deny that, in some cases, these programs can spit out objectively beautiful outputs. But as much as those AI images might look right, there’s always something missing: whether it’s the person behind it trying to communicate something they can’t quite articulate, or the surprise and frustration of actually getting your hands dirty with a tool.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tyxcDKSGvU2XD8QihHyCVA.png"" /><figcaption>Gemini’s image created form the prompt “draw me a dog”.

You’re left to watch dozens of other people’s prompts and outputs stream by, and few will truly experiment since it’s much easier to copy successful formulas when wanting a certain result.</p><p>Or the variation buttons — why struggle with your vision when you can just generate alternatives until one feels “good enough”? I can’t get over how these “creative” tools take away the mess and uncertainty where creativity actually happens, and offload what’s arguably the best part of the process to a randomising algorithm.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nx1xERWbQHABlj3iNGXx4Q.png"" /><figcaption>Midjourney running on Discord (screenshot <a href=""https://aituts.com/adding-midjourney-bot-discord-server/"">source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Looking at the bigger picture, it’s disheartening how as a society we can go from celebrating paintings made hundreds, even thousands of years ago, studying each stroke, letting them tell us a story and move us, to being satisfied with something so fundamentally different.</p><p>The point of art, no matter the category — I believe — is that it’s inseparable from the artist behind it. To an extent we can see the quirks and struggle in every piece, sometimes a message, or at the very least, the personality of the artist. What draws us to art isn’t only its beauty — it’s the artist’s way of seeing that gets captured by all the tiny decisions made while creating it. And that’s what makes art unique and human.</p><p>I am <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/the-design-of-shallow-thinking-4627e254a7b3?sk=d121456de089061f1293e7063524e1b4"">by my own admission</a> a bit of romantic when it comes to oldschool software, but if creativity becomes automated we risk losing the very thing that makes art meaningful — the experience of creating something.

Scrolling through options until you find a good one doesn’t really scream creative process.</p><p>Recently I had a conversation with someone comparing AI art to electronic music (along the lines of <em>“new technology disrupts an art form, skeptics resist but creativity adapts”</em>). I’m not a musician myself but I think that when you dig deeper, the two situations are quite different in terms of what technology is doing to the creative process: electronic music gave artists new ways to create, while AI art gives <em>machines</em> new ways to imitate creation.</p><p>We should recognise this distinction especially because we spend our careers thinking about how interfaces guide decisions. We know that removing steps from a process doesn’t just make it faster, but it can change what that process <em>is</em>.</p><p>So I keep thinking about this ugly digital dog from 1999, how it might be the most valuable piece of art in my memory, even though — or especially because — it was not perfect and looked almost nothing like a dog.</p><h4>Further reads/watch</h4><p><a href=""https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/ai-is-not-democratizing-creativity"">AI is not “democratizing creativity.” It’s doing the opposite</a> — Brian Merchant<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55Z4cg5Fyu4"">Sora proves the AI bubble is going to burst so hard</a> — Adam Conover<br />Reclaiming Art in the Age of Artifice — J.

<h4>Design doesn’t start with pixels or shapes, but with how the brain perceives color and emotion.</h4><figure><img alt=""A yellow LEGO head with a colorful brain sticking out, against a vertical rainbow-striped background."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MTkEF1AH8tRpG1IR5iNxSA.png"" /><figcaption>Some elements were created using AI.

For us as designers, it provides a lens that helps us build hypotheses and create meaningful concepts. But I believe it’s crucial to remember that <em>design</em><strong> </strong>is<strong> </strong>neither a result nor a goal only but a process of solving problems, as Design Council mentions it in <a href=""https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/fileadmin/uploads/dc/Documents/DesignCouncil_Design%2520methods%2520for%2520developing%2520services.pdf"">their paper</a>.

Now, let’s examine these concepts of Color Psychology more closely.</p><h3>How our brain perceives color</h3><p>I think we sometimes underestimate the meaning and importance of color in interfaces and design. Yet I would argue that color is one of the most crucial aspects of design itself. I would like support this interpretation with the findings from two scientific paper <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6673893/""><em>Estimation of the Timing of Human Visual Perception from Magnetoencephalography</em></a><em> </em>and <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00674/full""><em>Early recurrent feedback facilitates visual object recognition under challenging conditions</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Our perception of color begins the moment light hits the retina and activates the cone cells, each sensitive to different wavelengths. The signal is then sent directly to the limbic system, the part of the brain responsible for emotional responses.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram illustrating the visual pathways in the human brain."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*WS_-cGEcUotrnrQ2"" /><figcaption>Image source - <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/human-eye/The-nervous-messages"">Britanica</a></figcaption></figure><p>This structure evolved long before the neocortex, which handles rational thought. In other words, our emotional brain reacts to color before our logical brain even gets involved. The limbic system also connects emotions with memory, motivation, and instincts, which explains why color can instantly trigger feelings, associations, and even behavioral responses.</p><p>In other words, our brains have evolved to process color before form or content and, importantly, to do so while bypassing the neocortex, which handles rational thinking.</p><p>This means that before your user even begins to consciously recognize shapes or read text, they’ve already experienced an emotional response to the colors on the screen.</p><p>Of course, in research we’re talking about milliseconds but to me, even a reaction that happens up to four times fasteris a huge difference. It reminds us that color doesn’t just decorate a design; it sets the emotional stage for how users will interpret everything that follows.</p><p>Let’s look at an example. I’ll be showing you a series of illustrative images that serve as analogies for how our brain perceives visual information.</p><h4>Sensory perception of color</h4><p>In the first <strong>0–50 milliseconds</strong> after light hits the retina, the cone cells react to the wavelength — it’s <strong>pure physics</strong>. At this stage, your brain doesn’t yet “know” what happened: <em>the signal has just begun its journey through the visual pathway.</em></p><figure><img alt=""Dark background without content on it."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*566ikSMtMS3wXR8SPB7yQA.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Shevchenko-Tymchuk.</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Primary color processing</strong></h4><p>Around <strong>80–120 milliseconds</strong> after the stimulus, your brain isolates color as a distinct signal. A pure sensation of color forms, along with an <strong>emotional reaction</strong> — because the information is already being processed in the limbic system. <em>You see red. It’s a strong visual stimulus, which is why my element has already captured your attention.</em></p><figure><img alt=""A blurred circular composition with a dark center, a soft gray halo, and a small red area on the left side"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zWPpuLH8_NWA1lF5n5so6g.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Shevchenko-Tymchuk.</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Analysis of shape, contours, and motion</strong></h4><p>At around <strong>150–200 milliseconds</strong>, the brain begins to <strong>calculate geometry, boundaries, texture, and depth</strong>. At this stage, the information is still fragmented. <em>The brain has simply detected a rectangle and a collection of other visual elements,</em> but hasn’t yet formed a complete picture.</p><figure><img alt=""A blurred rectangular shape with a red circle on the left and several black rectangles arranged in two rows on a light gray background, centered against a dark backdrop."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Cygio0MxO1iY0-g_bcZl6g.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Shevchenko-Tymchuk.</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Object and context recognition</strong></h4><p>After about <strong>200–300 milliseconds</strong>, the information is integrated in the associative cortex — this is the moment when <strong>we recognize what we’re seeing. </strong><em>This is probably a notification.</em></p><figure><img alt=""A light gray rectangular box centered on a black background, featuring scattered black letters of varying sizes and a red exclamation mark symbol inside a circle on the left side."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Msmw53t4mBaJQw1hGEIdQg.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Shevchenko-Tymchuk.</figcaption></figure><h4>Cognitive evaluation</h4><p>Only after about <strong>300–450 milliseconds</strong> from the moment you look at the button does the rational process begin. The neocortex interprets the meaning. <em>A red banner with the word ‘error’ and a warning icon — that means something went wrong in the system.</em></p><figure><img alt=""A centered rectangular notification box with rounded corners on a black background. Inside, a red exclamation mark icon appears to the left of the bold black text “ERROR,” followed by the smaller phrase “Oops! Something went wrong.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZETQsgl4h4a5pKm9rU_ThA.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Shevchenko-Tymchuk.</figcaption></figure><p>So I’d like you to notice something: by the time you already felt a slight sense of alert from seeing the red color, your brain still needed another 200–300 milliseconds to fully decode what was actually happening.</p><p>And now, my dear designers, I invite you to try a little experiment. Take any interface design and increase the duration of all animations by 250 milliseconds. You’ll instantly feel how even such seemingly tiny time differences can dramatically change your perception of what you see.</p><h3>The reality of color</h3><p>The second aspect of color that absolutely fascinates me is its duality, especially when it comes to how we perceive it. On one hand, color is a subjective experience but on the other, it’s something we can measure with extraordinary precision.</p><h4>The immeasurable side of color</h4><p>We know that every person is unique, and we still can’t definitively prove or disprove whether we all see colors in the same way as Prof. Semir Zeki states in his Lecture on Color Perception. What we do know is that perception depends on the cone cells in our eyes and their quantity and ratio can vary from person to person.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/319a9b559cd834f86cbc166659569f70/href"">https://medium.com/media/319a9b559cd834f86cbc166659569f70/href</a><p>And another mystery remains, how exactly our brain interprets colors, and whether it does so in the same way for everyone. Some people can see more or fewer shades, while others might not distinguish basic colors at all. In very rare cases, some individuals may even experience monochromatic vision, not only due to missing cones, but also as a result of brain damage.</p><h4>The true nature of color</h4><p>Color doesn’t actually exist in nature. Yes, that’s right: leaves aren’t really green, the sky isn’t truly blue, and even an emerald isn’t <em>actually</em> green. All of this is an illusion. Our brain’s interpretation of light according to an article <a href=""https://www.spectroscopyonline.com/view/where-perception-meets-reality-the-science-of-measuring-color""><em>Where Perception Meets Reality: The Science of Measuring Color</em></a>.</p><p>In reality, what we see is not color but light. Depending on the wavelength of that light, the cone receptors in our retina are activated in different ways. The wavelength changes because light reflects off objects and that reflection shifts the wave. What’s fascinating is that this shift is influenced not just by the objects themselves but by their atoms.</p><figure><img alt=""Horizontal gradient from dark purple through green to bright red."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*1QxEAuRmQORL5qkn.png"" /><figcaption>Image source - <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=4639774"">Gringer</a></figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5207327/"">This principle is used by astrophysicists to determine which elements dominate on distant exoplanets</a>: by calculating how specific atoms interact with light. With ultra-sensitive sensors, we can detect even the slightest variations in wavelength reflected from those planets.</p><p>And here’s the key point the atom, the fundamental building block of all matter, has no color of its own. It merely interacts with photons. So, the matter and objects around us are colorless without light.</p><p>So we’ve now touched on the second side of what makes color so fascinating: it’s a sensory stimulus that can be described quantitatively: wavelength, intensity, saturation.</p><p>Unlike many other aspects of psychology, color is something we can measure with extreme precision, minimizing any margin of error in experimental data and making it one of the most reliable subjects for psychological research. Yet it remains a complex phenomenon because, we still can’t fully measure the brain that perceives it.</p><h4><em>The color model I trust most</em></h4><p>At the end of the 19th century, long before Johannes Itten’s theories, Wilhelm Wundt laid the foundation for the psychological classification of color in his work <a href=""https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Wundt/Physio/intro.htm""><em>Principles of Physiological Psychology</em></a>.</p><p>In my opinion, every designer should be familiar with and understand this framework. Wundt was the first to describe color not merely as a physical property of light, but as a set of psychological parameters of perception forming so called “psychological space of color”, defined by three independent dimensions:</p><ol><li><strong>Hue</strong> — the actual type of color (red, green, blue, etc.)</li><li><strong>Saturation</strong> — the degree of color purity, or how much “gray” is mixed into it</li><li><strong>Brightness</strong> — the perceived lightness or luminance of the color</li></ol><p>This concept became the foundation for the later development of these ideas and the creation of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV""><strong>HSV color model</strong></a>.</p><figure><img alt=""Comparison of HSL and HSV color models showing hue, saturation, and lightness/value relationships in 3D diagrams and gradient slices."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*U-kK5AmTp2noWFGJ.png"" /><figcaption>Image source - <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=9445469"">Jacob Rus</a></figcaption></figure><p>Personally, I tend to use this model most often in design, as it gives far greater control over the visual outcome compared to the more rigid machine-encoded HEX or the physically-based RGB formats. HSV allows you to work with color in a way that feels more natural and intuitive, while still providing precise control for subtle adjustments in the final result.</p><h3>The influence of color on humans</h3><p>Let’s now move from how we perceive color to how it affects us — and how we interpret it from a scientific point of view.</p><h4>Emotional response to color</h4><p>We’ve already touched on the emotional component earlier, so let’s start there. <strong>Warm colors are known to speed up reactions and increase physiological arousal</strong>. According to the <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279871278_Color-in-Context_Theory""><em>Color-in-Context Theory</em></a>, warm colors stimulate the nervous system and enhance motor responses. That’s exactly why shades of red, orange, and yellow are so often used for CTA buttons, alerts, and error messages, anywhere we need to grab attention instantly or create a sense of urgency.</p><p>At the same time, the same study notes that <strong>cool colors help reduce stress and create a sense of stability</strong>. Blue and green hues are shown to lower anxiety levels, slow down breathing, and evoke feelings of trust and safety.<br />That’s why these colors are so commonly used in banking, healthcare, and other sensitive interfaces — wherever calmness, reliability, and reassurance are essential.</p><h4>Cognitive response to color</h4><p>We also know that color influences cognitive functions such as concentration, memory, and creativity. In a 2009 study <a href=""https://www.appstate.edu/~steelekm/classes/psy5300/Documents/Mehta%26Zhu2009.pdf""><em>Blue or Red? Exploring the Effect of Color on Cognitive Task Performances</em></a>, researchers found that <strong>blue enhances creative thinking</strong> and promotes exploration of new ideas, while <strong>red improves focus and attention</strong> to detail. This means that through color, we can influence not only the emotional state of our users but also guide their cognitive processes, subtly steering their minds toward the state most aligned with the task at hand.</p><h4>Cultural perception of color</h4><p>It’s important to note that the <strong>psychological response to color is largely universal</strong> among humans, according to <a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/002202217300400201""><em>A Cross-Cultural Study of the Affective Meanings of Color</em></a>, emotional reactions to a color’s brightness and warmth are not dependent on cultural or social context.</p><p>However, <strong>color can also acquire symbolic meaning</strong> such as associations with mourning, happiness, or pain, which are shaped by socio-cultural factors. For instance:</p><ul><li>White represents purity in Western cultures but mourning in China.</li><li>Red is often seen as danger in the West, yet as a symbol of luck and prosperity in Asia.</li><li>Green generally feels positive and natural to most of us, but in Indonesia, it signifies “forbidden.”</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Traffic light with red, yellow, and blue signals above a Japanese sign against a blue sky and green trees."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/690/0*9CILeKbx0ZEaBqIj.jpg"" /><figcaption>Image Source - <a href=""http://www.japantravelplanning.com"">www.japantravelplanning.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>So as designers, we can confidently use color to communicate directly with the limbic system, influencing emotion and attention on a biological level but we must also remain aware of cultural context when using color as a symbol, such as the familiar “traffic light logic” so often applied in interface design. For example, until the 20th century, the Japanese language had no separate word for “green.” All hues between blue and green were described by the same word 青い (aoi), meaning both “blue” and “green”, which has led some lights to be a bluer shade of green.</p><h3>Why every designer should start with color psychology</h3><p>I’m sure these theories form the essential foundation every designer should enter the profession with and keep exploring throughout their career. Because in the end, we are learning to speak emotions with our users, and color is what speaks directly to their emotions.</p><p>In my opinion, many of these principles shouldn’t be treated merely as hypotheses that demand constant validation, but as axioms we can confidently build upon. No matter what you test or how you test it, red will always attract more attention than blue, as I wrote earlier, some things are universal.</p><p>It’s important to remember that unless you plan to conduct research on hundreds, maybe thousands, of participants using brain-scanning equipment, you’re unlikely to reinvent the wheel or to prove, through ordinary user testing, a new universal psychological truth about color that hasn’t already been explored by scientists.</p><p>And yet, that’s exactly where I find beauty in being a designer. Because we work with people, not with algorithms. Our role is to ask, to listen, and to adapt, to consider the socio-cultural context, the personal story, and the environments that shape how your user group perceives both color and design.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e5e6556919da"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-color-reflex-psychology-that-fires-before-you-think-e5e6556919da"">The color reflex: Psychology that fires before you think</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/book-to-tv-movies-adaptations-2025"">newest adaptation</a> of Mary Shelley’s timeless novel <em>Frankenstein</em> has captivated audiences, with director Guillermo del Toro’s film being praised for being mostly faithful to the source material. Starring Australia’s own Jacob Elordi as The Creature and Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein, somehow it’s Mia Goth, as Elizabeth Lavenza, who steals the show — adorned by Tiffany &amp; Co. jewels and 19th Century gowns. Her extensive wardrobe for <em>Frankenstein</em> came from the mind of Emmy Award-nominated <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/materialists-dakota-johnson-outfits-costumes"">costume designer</a> Kate Hawley, who has worked on projects such as <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</em> and <em>Crimson Peak</em>. Goth’s character Elizabeth has an interest in entomology and botany, so Hawley included nods to beetles and other insects through patterns and garment shapes. Along with wasp-waisted <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/how-to-style-corsets"">tight corsets</a>, certain fabrics were also chosen to mimic paper-thin beetle wings.</p>



<p>“With the green dress… that design was inspired by butterflies, and the patterns on butterfly wings,” Goth tells <em>Refinery29 Australia</em>. “[This] was something that Guillermo and Kate were exploring a lot with Elizabeth and [with] all of the costumes, everything was thought through.” To create unique insect-like patterns, Hawley studied both cellular structures and the anatomy of beetles. “It’s all about echoing those insect and beetle-like qualities, just fitted to the period,” Hawley says in the production notes.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941847.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=682&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A341"" /></figure>



<p>Jewellery was also key to defining Goth’s character, with her blue outfit featuring a Tiffany &amp; Co. signature piece from the early 1900s. The Louis Comfort Tiffany necklace is made up of blue glass beetle motifs in a gold setting. “We wanted to pull pieces that were from the age of Mary Shelley so that you could study the choices our designers were making at that time,” Christopher Young, Vice President and Creative Director of Tiffany Patrimony and Global Creative Visual Merchandising, said in a <a href=""https://www.tiffany.com/world-of-tiffany/collaborations/netflix-frankenstein.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">press video</a>. The result is what jewellers describe as blurring the line “between jewellery and art”.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941846.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=682&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A341"" /></figure>



<p>One of Elizabeth’s most striking dresses is her final look, a white dress where white satin ribbons wrap around her arms. Made to resemble surgical bandages, it pays homage to both Elizabeth’s fate and The Creature’s origin. “That was deliberate,” Goth says. “That was there to mimic The Creature and his band aids that he has when he’s first born.” This white dress also features multiple layers of fabric that capture the light in an interesting way, a design element thought through by both the costume designer and director. “Guillermo wanted Elizabeth to be very ethereal, and there’s an iridescence and ephemeral nature to some of those colours and fabrics that helped us [portray this],” Hawley notes.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941845.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=682&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A341"" /></figure>



<p>There’s also a religious nod in many of Elizabeth’s outfits, particularly seen through the use of bonnets. “Religious language is a big part of Elizabeth’s character, and that bonnet is like a halo,” Hawley explains. “Mia has such an amazing, mercurial face  — one of the first fittings we had, we put that bonnet on her, and we put the yellow veil over her, and she just became this other creature.” While Goth jokingly tells <em>R29 </em>she couldn’t breathe in her restrictive wardrobe, stepping into the period pieces helped frame her performance as Elizabeth. “That was helpful, because that’s exactly how a woman in the Victorian world would feel, and it formed how I moved and how I sat,” Goth says. “I felt once I started to see where the costumes were headed, I found my character, Elizabeth, kind of from the outside in this time around. </p>



<p>“So, [by] seeing what they were doing with her on the outside, I was then able to kind of figure out what was going on in the inside.” </p>

Uruguayan sisters Lucía and Florencia Ottonello founded their <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/pastiche_sisterproject/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">slow-fashion brand Pastiche</a> in Montevideo in 2016. Nine years later, the brand’s cozy knits, structured denim, and breezy linen pieces are now available in the U.S. Last week, <a href=""https://pastichesisterproject.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pastiche launched its U.S. website</a>, making its playful, ethically made designs accessible to new shoppers. And with a collection of warm textures and artful silhouettes, the expansion comes just in time for our fall and winter seasons.<br /><br />“We’re vintage-inspired but still modern. We are most interested in classic looks,” Florencia told Refinery29 Somos of Pastiche's designs. “You’ll want to keep our pieces and pass them down. They’re not items to be discarded.” <br /><br />Pastiche’s commitment to slow, ethical production means every item is designed and crafted in Uruguay, often working with Uruguayan, Argentine, and Brazilian suppliers as well as local artisans. This approach not only preserves South American techniques and styles, but it also ensures fair wages, sustainable practices, and clothing that’s built to last — all increasingly meaningful choices for conscious consumers.<br /><br />“We’re just looking forward to growing thoughtfully. We don't need stores everywhere, we just want to make clothes that people feel good in, pay our folks well, and spend time with our families,” Florencia said.<br /><br />To celebrate the launch, we selected some of our favorite Pastiche pieces that are perfect for the cooler months, so that you can layer responsibly, mix textures, and invest in timeless, versatile pieces that will carry you through many more falls and winters.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

<p>Yet another <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/old-navy-anna-sui-collaboration-2025"">cool-girl fashion collaboration</a> has entered the chat. This time, model Alexa Chung is celebrating her <a href=""https://www.madewell.com/feature/alexa-chung-collection/"">long-standing relationship with Madewell</a> — 15 years after their first collaboration — with a vintage-inspired <a href=""https://www.madewell.com/feature/alexa-chung-collection/"">holiday collection</a> that pays homage to the East Village <em>and</em> East London.<br /><br />“We’ve been on a journey together, me and Madewell,” Chung tells Refinery29. “I’ve always made an effort to make things super personal, but this is definitely the most personal collection that we’ve collaborated on. It’s very vintage inspired and it’s also quite musically led, so it’s really specific to my tastes. I am thrilled with it.”<br /><br />From tried-and-true winter styles like oversized sweaters, crochet scarves, lacy slip dresses, and herringbone dress coats, to more <em>unexpected</em> styles like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/soccer-jersey-outfit-ideas-women"">football jerseys</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/white-jeans-styling-outfit-ideas"">white jeans</a>, and “We’re Witches Bitches” graphic tees, the collaboration perfectly reflects Chung’s “eclectic, specific, and cool” aesthetic.<br /><br />The nostalgic and romantic 31-piece collection also spans distressed <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/08/11495317/madewell-plus-size-denim-review"">Madewell jeans</a> and leather skirts and jackets, as well as giftable accessories like crew socks, hooded scarves, and floral brooches. Chung specifically recommends gifting one of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-statement-belts-women"">statement belts</a> for the holidays. “I love <a href=""https://www.madewell.com/p/NY939/?ccode=EX0001"">this belt</a> because it can cinch your waist over a dress, slung low with baggy jeans, or wear it over loads of coats. I love the idea of jewelry over outerwear, so I’d probably get someone one of the belts.”</p>

<p>And in terms of her winter wardrobe staple, Chung highlights the <a href=""https://www.madewell.com/p/NY883/?ccode=WR2252"">collection’s peacoat</a>. “The navy blue coat is my non-negotiable winter coat. It’s genuinely warm. It’s a classic silhouette. It’s a bit oversized, it’s quite boxy, but you can fit your sweater underneath. It just makes you feel quite handsome and powerful when you put it on,” she explains.<br /><br />Whether you’re shopping for $24 brooches to gift to your fashion-loving friends or a $598 leather jacket to treat yourself, every piece will help you channel It-girl Chung’s signature style… and perhaps even Meg Ryan’s? The model says that if any fictional character would wear this nostalgic collection, it would be one of Ryan’s rom-com characters from ‘90s-era movies like <em>When Harry Met Sally</em>, <em>Sleepless in Seattle</em>, and <em>You’ve Got Mail</em>.<br /><br />What more could we want from a cozy-season collection? We’ll have what Alexa’s having!</p>

Winter is long, and having cuddles on tap sounds quite nice. Hence <a href=""https://bumble.com/the-buzz/what-is-cuffing-season"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">cuffing season</a>: the period when people “cuff” another <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/friends-to-lovers-stories"">into a relationship</a> for the colder months. Sometimes we cuff or get cuffed consciously, other times less so — you may be cuffed and not realize the other person’s intentions. Either way, something about this time of year makes us want to shack up and be cozy with someone else.<br /><br />This feels like a lot of work, to find someone now and put in the effort for a relationship that will probably end with the change in seasons. Some research has put it down to a desire to avoid feeling lonely — as many as <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/datingcom-found-that-online-activity-hits-peak-season-during-cold-winter-months-300926222.html"">60% of people</a> turn to dating apps in winter for this reason. Where summer can be socially full-on and active, the prospect of an emptier calendar during winter might make swiping for dates more attractive. <br /><br />Like all relationships, some end horribly, others are over as quickly as they began and some manage to go the distance, like Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. Ahead, Refinery29 spoke to five women about their own cuffing season relationships — how they went, how they ended (or didn’t), and how they felt about it. <figure><figcaption><strong>Lila, 26, New York</strong><br /><br />I entered into a cuffing season relationship three to four months after breaking up with my boyfriend of two years. We talked for half of September, started seeing each other at the end of September, and went on dates until the end of November. We were intimate and I really liked the guy, although I thought things were too good to be true. <br /><br />I eventually went to look him up on social media at the end of October and saw he was anti-immigration, slightly MAGA and very incel-leaning (at least his Twitter likes were). I had made my politics very clear. I am very liberal and was actively outspoken at the time about Palestine and leftist ideals. It was so weird to see [his online activity] and I showed a bunch of my friends to make sure I wasn't crazy. <br /><br />Before I got to break up with him, he reached out and said he just wanted to be friends. He contacts me every so often with memes about my profession, and now he has become my seafood hookup (he works at a seafood market and whenever I want expensive seafood like scallops and oysters for free, I text him and he brings it to me. Nothing sexual there, he just hooks me up with free seafood!). Honestly, he was a rebound who should have never happened. I deleted the apps soon after that because I centered my interests towards engaging in my weekly therapy sessions.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><strong>Tiphani, 35, Mississippi</strong><br /><br />My last cuffing season relationship was hot and heavy. It started at the beginning of January and ended in February. We got snowed in together and he made an effort to Uber or Lyft back to my house if he had to go into work. He would cook every day. And we would lie around and watch movies and talk until bedtime. I didn’t think it was going to be temporary. I thought we were on the same page.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after the snow melted, the relationship also became a puddle. I tried to keep it going but the communication became almost nonexistent and I just had to block him, move on, and let it go. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><strong>Olivia, 28, London</strong><br /><br />I dated someone for four months who categorically did not fancy me. I don't think I really fancied him either. We met in September and in January he dumped me over text as soon as my plane landed back from Christmas break. New year, new him, I guess. I think I knew deep down there wasn't attraction — we barely connected physically and I told myself he was just shy and my self-esteem was low. It was low, but going out with someone who isn't attracted to you will do that. <br /><br />I realize now this was the end result of a ""year of dating"" I put myself through. I pressured myself to put in more time and effort and go on more dates, and by September I was exhausted and the nights were drawing in. So the first person who consistently asked me out on dates (and was not cheating on someone with me, or another such horror story), I just leapt at. We did all the seasonal winter stuff as he'd just moved to London, but I wish I'd spent more time doing that with my friends. I realized that a year on dating apps had set my bar so low that someone consistently asking me on the next date had become incredibly impressive. <br /><br />This season I feel just as burned out by dating if I am honest, but I realize going out with someone who doesn't like me is not the answer to that. I've joined a stand-up comedy course instead. <br /><br />Last week my friend informed me she ""doesn't date from October to April, it's just too cold"" and honestly? I might join her. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><strong>Kerry, 47, Melbourne </strong><br /><br />My cuffing season story goes back 10 years. We met doing a casual security stint at a comedy festival. Our relationship ended up lasting for a couple of years, on and off. Sometimes I'd get random calls saying, ""Guess who this is?"" after a break.<br /><br />He'd tell me I was very beautiful but that I was too old for him, especially in his Indian culture where this was frowned upon. I'm unsure if that was to placate me but he did find me attractive. We'd hook up at my place. Once it even happened at a work site!<br /><br />I got into this relationship knowing it was temporary. I wasn't fussed at all. We both knew that. Long term would have been too complicated. And that casualness wouldn’t work on me these days. My standards are much higher! The casualness worked at the time. Also, at the time it gave me confidence and boosted my self-esteem. Much later down the line though, when we were both married, he gave me a call. This annoyed me; it was as if he was expecting me to be alone, and I thought it a betrayal of his wife. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><strong>Shriya, 25, Virginia</strong><br /><br />I ended up getting in a cuffing season relationship two years ago with someone who turned out to be the love of my life and we're planning on being engaged soon. It was my most successful cuffing season of all time!<br /><br />We originally met in undergrad at the University of Pittsburgh. His best friend and I were friends so we crossed paths but we never had any conversations or expressed interest in each other. A couple years went by and we graduated. During the pandemic, a large group of our friends would finish work together on Zoom every night (about 30 people) and we joined in. He and I started talking on the side. We had a <em>really</em> long talking phase for months during cuffing season where neither of us said anything or even made the first move but you could tell we were clearly interested in seeing where it went. We just didn't know if we were going to see each other since he was in Kansas and I was in Virginia, so no one attached any hopes to the situation. Even when he asked me on our first date, he said, ""Hey, I'm coming to DC to see a couple friends, would you like to meet up?"" and I had to ask if it was a date to clarify. But once we went on the first date, it was game over. We've been together ever since.<br /><br />Everyone says when you know, you know, and it's very true. He asked to meet my parents the weekend of our first date, and a few weeks later he asked me to meet his. I think it was easier for us to jump in because our talking phase was so long that we had a chance to really know each other and vet the person first before jumping into a physical date.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939482.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings… we thought we were coasting to the finish line of 2025, but baby, the cosmos said, “Not so fast.” This week kicks off with a <em>mind maze</em> of epic proportions as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury begins its final retrograde</a> of the year <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">on November</a> 9 at 2:02 p.m. EST, and it’s happening in none other than Sagittarius — the sign of bold opinions, big dreams, and spontaneous “let’s go to Bali” texts. <br /><br />But under Mercury retrograde? Yeah… your GPS might glitch halfway through the journey. Sag energy loves to think big picture, but Mercury is trying to zoom in and say, “Wait, did you really mean that? Or were you just avoiding the details?” This is the kind of transit that makes you question your own hot takes. So if you suddenly backpedal on that workshop you were going to launch or rethink that long-distance situationship you were convinced was <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/moon-phases-meaning-astrology"">soulmate-level</a> last week, you’re not flaky… you’re realigning. </p>



<p>The upside? Mercury retrograde in Sagittarius helps us relearn how to tell the truth, not the curated one, but the gut-level, soul-naked kind. You might revise that book pitch, backtrack on those travel plans, or finally admit that your “freedom” narrative was really a fear of intimacy in disguise. Don’t rush. Let yourself unlearn what you thought was the truth. Just double-check your emails, avoid signing contracts unless necessary, and be open to divine redirections. A closed door is a cosmic yes in another language. <br /><br />Then comes a major <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-11-11-angel-number-november-2023"">energetic shift on 11/11</a>, a sacred astro-numerological portal, and this year it hits different because Jupiter, planet of expansion, luck, and vision, begins its retrograde journey in Cancer at 11:41 a.m. EST. This is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter’s first retrograde in Cancer</a> in over a decade, and it’s pulling our energy inward, homeward, and backward. Think: ancestral roots, childhood patterns, and that “do I even want to live here anymore?” conversation that keeps circling your brain. The answers come slowly, but they’re sacred. You might be called to downsize, simplify, or renovate — not just your space, but your lifestyle. Maybe you thought you wanted a bigger house, but now you crave a cozier, quieter one. Maybe you thought you wanted to raise kids in the city, but now you’re craving ocean air and moonlight. This isn’t about contraction. It’s about rooted expansion. Jupiter retrograde in Cancer reminds us that the dream isn’t real if you can’t rest in it. </p>



<p>On November 12, the Last Quarter Moon in Leo flares up the tension between your public self and your private desires. This is a shedding moon — one that asks: <em>Is the persona you’re performing still aligned with who you’re becoming?</em> Leo moons can make us crave attention, validation, and applause, but this one’s got a little edge to it. You might feel hyper-aware of who’s watching, liking, or not responding at all. But instead of spiraling, try this: let it go. Use this quarter moon to release the pressure to be seen and instead commit to <em>seeing yourself</em>. The right people will always feel you. And the rest? Dust. </p>



<p>The week wraps with the Virgo Moon taking over from November 13 to 15, bringing a calming wave of discernment; not the perfectionist kind, but the cleansing, clarifying kind. This is the “<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-2025-zodiac-signs"">get your life together</a>” moon, but with softness. There are only six weeks left in 2025. This moon isn’t here to shame you for what you didn’t get done… it’s here to help you see what’s still worth doing. Let it highlight what’s still alive in your spirit. Where are you still passionate? Where are you tired for no reason? With Mercury retrograde ruling Virgo from fiery Sagittarius, this is your reminder that just because something once excited you doesn’t mean it still fits your values now. This week is a reclamation. Of your voice, of your truth, of your energy. <br /><br />You can be wise, wild, and well rested. Let that be your mantra as we enter the final stretch of the year.  <br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, buckle up because Mercury retrograde in Sagittarius (starting November 9) is throwing some fire back in your direction… but not the type you can just power through. This retrograde hits your sector of expansion, travel, and publishing, so if you’ve got big plans, launches, interviews, or even far-off journeys on deck, double- and triple-check the logistics. You might feel misunderstood or even dragged online for something you said with the best of intentions — but instead of spiraling into defensiveness, use this time to ask yourself: <em>What do I actually believe, and is it still true for the version of me I’m becoming?</em> You’re not meant to shrink; you’re meant to refine. Editing your message, rethinking your audience, and getting clear about your voice doesn’t make you a sellout — it makes you someone with staying power. Think: slow down to go global. <br /><br />And then comes the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-11-11-angel-number-november-2023"">11/11 portal</a>, where Jupiter begins retrograding in Cancer, your sector of home, family, and emotional roots. <em>Whew</em>. That one might hit a little deeper than you expected. Whether it’s your literal home or your internal sense of safety, this retrograde is asking you to pause and reflect. Do you still want to live where you are? Are you ready to build something new — or rebuild something old, but on your terms this time? Some Aries might suddenly crave a simpler life, downsizing their lifestyle or revisiting childhood patterns that shaped how they seek comfort. Others might feel pulled to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/november-tarotscopes-messages-ancestors"">connect with their ancestors</a>, mend family dynamics, or even reimagine what “home” means — especially if the old definition was wrapped in performance or pressure. You don’t have to fix it all right now. But <em>feel it</em>. Jupiter’s reminding you that true growth starts at the root. </p>



<p>By the time the Virgo Moon arrives (November 13 to 15), your spirit’s like, <em>okay, enough existential spiraling</em>, let’s get back in the body. This earthy moon moves through your health and wellness sector, giving you a stabilizing moment in an otherwise reflective week. The good news? This moon doesn’t want you to perfect anything — it just wants you to notice. Notice where you’ve been neglecting routines that actually help you feel more alive. Notice the little habits that need tweaking. And more than anything, notice what your body has been trying to tell you, especially as your mind has been zooming into big-picture questions all week. This is your mid-month grounding ritual. Drink the tea. Stretch your back. Cancel the plan you didn’t want to go to anyway. You’re allowed to rest even in the middle of the chaos. Especially then. </p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury’s retrograde in Sagittarius</a> beginning November 9 might stir up more than just philosophical questions — it’s nudging you into the shadows of your own psyche, your intimacy sector, where power, vulnerability, and shared resources live. And yeah… it could get a little messy. Old debts (emotional or financial) might resurface. Someone you thought you were “done” with might pop back in with a question or an apology. Or maybe it’s you who’s suddenly feeling called to unpack past decisions — especially the ones you’ve quietly judged yourself for. <br /><br />This retrograde isn’t about punishment, it’s about integration. What part of you have you been hiding out of fear of rejection or loss? You’re being invited to reclaim it. Reclaim your power, even if that means fumbling your way through some uncomfortable convos or realizations. Growth rarely comes wrapped in silk — sometimes it shows up with receipts and a mirror. </p>



<p>Then, on 11/11, Jupiter begins its retrograde in Cancer, activating your communication and mindset zone — and that’s a big cosmic green light to slow your roll and listen more deeply. This isn’t about talking less, it’s about being more intentional with your voice. If you’re writing something big, launching something, or trying to have heart-to-hearts, give yourself space to revise, reword, or even re-feel what you’re trying to express. Childhood memories or old stories about your intelligence or communication style might resurface — not to haunt you, but to be rewritten with compassion. Are you speaking your truth… or the truth you think others expect from you? This is a powerful time to reconnect with your inner narrator and ask: <em>Is this the story I want to keep telling about myself?</em> If not, 11/11 is a beautiful portal for rewriting it. </p>



<p>By the time the Moon lands in Virgo from November 13 to 15, your creativity and joy sector becomes the stage for a mid-month emotional check-in. This isn’t about productivity — it’s about pleasure with purpose. Have you forgotten what makes you laugh? What makes you play? If you’ve been stuck in a loop of “doing the work,” this Moon invites you to remember why you’re doing it at all. Maybe it’s time to reconnect with your inner child, or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/creativity-art-therapy-classes"">tend to a creative project</a> that’s been whispering your name. Maybe you just need to dance around your room with your phone on airplane mode. </p>



<p>Whatever it is, don’t wait for permission to delight in being alive again. You’ve been deep in the waters all week — now let this Virgo Moon offer you earth to stand on, and joy to reach for. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, let’s be real: Mercury’s retrograde starting November 9 is going to hit different, because it’s happening in your relationship sector (in the sign of Sagittarius), and Mercury’s <em>your</em> ruling planet. So yeah, you’re gonna feel it. Expect some double-texting energy, some “Wait… what did they <em>really</em> mean by that?” vibes, and maybe a ghost or two reappearing just when you thought you were emotionally vaccinated. This isn’t about drama for the sake of drama, though. It’s about clarity. If you’ve been unclear about what you want in love, business partnerships, or even creative collaborations, this retrograde could shake the dust off that indecision. Misunderstandings may happen, but they’re revealing what needs to be refined. And hey, if an ex pops up and you’re tempted? Ask yourself: Is this curiosity, closure, or an escape from what’s actually available to you right now? <br /><br />Then there’s 11/11 — a major portal, and the same day Jupiter begins its retrograde in Cancer, which lights up your money and self-worth sector. This is deep. Like, ancestral beliefs about abundance deep. You might find yourself revisiting <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/starting-investing-real-stories"">decisions around savings, investing</a>, or even the ways you’ve been undervaluing yourself in business or relationships. If you’ve been hustling for approval or centering others’ needs out of fear of rejection, this week will lovingly (or not so lovingly) ask you to stop. You are not a backup dancer in your own life. Jupiter here says: <em>take up more space — but the retrograde says, first, check where you’ve been shrinking</em>. Maybe it’s time to raise your rates. Maybe it’s time to cut off a draining energetic tie that’s been taking more than it gives. Either way, your value isn’t negotiable, even if your pricing strategy is. </p>



<p>The Moon in Virgo from November 13 to 15 activates your home and emotional roots sector, and it’s basically a cosmic reminder to stop skipping the warm-up. You don’t have to be “on” all the time, Gem. You don’t even have to be figuring things out. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/you-look-happier-trend-embracing-messiness"">You’re allowed to simply be: messy</a>, soft, still. Clean your space if that helps you breathe easier. Make your bed like it’s an act of devotion. Call someone who reminds you of who you were before the world told you to hurry. This isn’t a weekend to impress; it’s a weekend to nourish. Let the Virgo Moon guide you back to rituals that restore your nervous system and ground your ideas. The clarity you’re craving isn’t out there — it’s in the quiet corners you’ve been too busy to visit. Go home to yourself. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, Mercury retrograde begins in your wellness, work, and routines sector on November 9, and let’s be real — if your body’s been whispering (or screaming) for rest, this is your sign to listen. This transit is like a cosmic timeout, forcing you to re-evaluate what “productivity” even means to you. Maybe you’ve been running on autopilot, saying yes out of guilt or fear instead of alignment. Maybe you’re craving a slower, softer pace but worried that if you stop, everything will collapse. Spoiler: it won’t. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrograde in Sagittarius</a> is clumsy and chaotic, yes… but also philosophical. It invites you to pull back from the grind and ask: What’s the point of all this effort if your joy and peace aren’t part of the equation? <br /><br />Then comes a cosmic curveball and blessing wrapped in one: Jupiter begins its retrograde in your sign on 11/11, and Cancer, this is <em>big</em>. You’ve been expanding so much this year, maybe even faster than your inner world could keep up with. This retrograde is here to help you integrate. To help you reclaim what you’ve given away in the name of growth, people-pleasing, or perfection. You might revisit decisions you made earlier this year with fresh eyes, and this time, you’ll choose differently. You may downsize, cancel a major plan, or close a door that once felt full of promise — not because you’ve failed, but because you’ve evolved. Think of this as a soul homecoming: a re-rooting. And with your planetary ruler, the Moon, lighting up your sector of self-worth during the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/super-beaver-full-moon-in-taurus-horoscope-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Taurus Full Moon</a> just days ago, your standards have risen — including the standards you hold for <em>yourself</em>. </p>



<p>As the Virgo Moon arrives November 13 to 15, things get even more introspective, but in the best, most clarifying way. This lunation activates your communication and learning sector, so consider it <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-say-no-to-friends"">your permission slip to say no</a>, mute the noise, and re-curate your reality. Read something that expands your mind. Journal without editing. Take a walk without your phone and let your own thoughts be the soundtrack. Even if retrograde chaos swirls around you, you’re building something quieter and more grounded inside. </p>



<p>Something sacred. The second half of the week is like a mid-month recalibration: Where do you need to simplify? What ideas need breathing room? Virgo wants you to declutter your mind, and Cancer, that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-protect-your-peace"">starts with choosing peace</a> over performance. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, Mercury starts its final retrograde of the year on November 9 in your creativity, joy, and romance sector, and let’s just say, things might get <em>messy-hot</em> or <em>hot-messy</em> real quick. You might reconnect with a past lover (or crush), find yourself rewriting an old creative idea, or even second-guessing the ways you express your joy. Retrogrades aren’t meant to stall you, they’re meant to rewire you, so if your flirt game feels off or your passion projects aren’t clicking, don’t force it. Play. Revisit your old journals, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/inner-child-healing"">revisit your inner child</a>. This retrograde wants to remind you that your creativity doesn’t have to be profitable, and your love doesn’t have to be performative. It just has to be <em>real</em>. <br /><br />Then on 11/11, a deeply emotional shift arrives: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter begins its retrograde in Cancer</a>, your sector of healing, rest, and closure. This is not the time to push. This is the time to soften. Some Leos may realize they’ve been carrying emotions that aren’t even theirs. Others may find themselves shedding ego identities that once felt protective — the performer, the leader, the strong one — in favor of deeper truth. You’re realizing that being seen isn’t always about being loud or perfect; it’s about being honest. Jupiter retro in Cancer helps you make peace with the past, with the versions of yourself you no longer need to be. Don’t be surprised if you find yourself yearning for solitude, sacred spaces, or spiritual nourishment. Let that be your compass. </p>



<p>As the Moon shifts into Virgo from November 13 to 15, you’ll feel a subtle but steady return to your values, money, and worth. You may be tempted to “fix” everything that feels off: your budget, your habits, your schedule, but the deeper ask is to center what actually sustains you. Not just financially, but emotionally, spiritually, physically. This Virgo Moon is your mid-month check-in: What’s been draining your light, and what’s been keeping it alive? The answers may not be flashy, but they’ll be <em>true</em>. Let simplicity lead. Let pleasure be enough. Let this week be a sacred act of recalibration — not so you can perform again, but so you can live more fully from your own center. </p>

<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, Mercury, your planetary ruler, begins its final retrograde of the year on November 9, in Sagittarius, in your sector of home, roots, and emotional foundations. This one’s going to feel personal. You might feel the urge to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/digital-decluttering-how-to"">declutter everything in sight</a>, rearrange your furniture, or suddenly feel overwhelmed by family dynamics you thought were behind you. This isn’t regression; it’s excavation. If old patterns arise, especially around caretaking, over-functioning, or needing to be “the responsible one,” pause before reacting. Mercury retrograde wants to rewire your foundation from the inside out — so let yourself grieve, journal, question, and even nap more than usual. You’re making room for the version of home that feels more chosen than inherited. </p>



<p>Then on 11/11, the ascension portal cracks open as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter retrogrades in Cancer</a>, illuminating your community and friendship sector. You may start to ask: Who really holds me? Who sees me when I’m not performing? Who do I trust to witness me in my becoming? This transit invites you to slow down your networking pace, rethink the roles you play in your social circles, and re-evaluate what solidarity actually looks like for you. Some Virgos may reconnect with old friends or communities that once brought joy, while others may realize they’ve outgrown certain connections — and that’s okay. Jupiter in retrograde is a cosmic blessing in disguise: it peels away the performance and leaves the soul. <br /><br />From November 13 to 15, the Moon moves through your sign, and you’ll feel it like a subtle inner drumbeat returning you to yourself. It’s a reminder that you don’t need to do more or fix more to be worthy of ease. This is your mid-month reset. Instead of obsessing over what isn’t working, focus on nourishing what is. Ground yourself in rituals that feel like medicine — whether it’s meal prepping, doing absolutely nothing, or getting lost in a book. Let yourself be the thing you take care of this time. The world can wait — your healing can’t. </p>

<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, Mercury retrogrades in Sagittarius on November 9, lighting up your communication, learning, and local environment sector. So let’s be real: your words may trip over themselves this week, even when your heart is clear. That brilliant idea? It might need a few more rounds of refinement before you hit publish. The text you didn’t mean to send, the meeting you show up to on the wrong day… it’s all part of the cosmic comedy. But beneath the mix-ups, something deeper’s being rewritten. What are you <em>really</em> trying to say, Libra? What truths have you been avoiding out of politeness or fear of rocking the boat? Mercury’s slowdown invites you to get honest — not just with others, but with yourself. You don’t always have to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10751082/should-you-trust-your-gut-instinct"">translate your intuition</a> into something digestible. <br /><br />Then on November 11 (11/11 portal), Jupiter begins its retrograde in Cancer, in your career and public image sector. If it feels like the outside world is slowing down just as you were picking up steam… that’s not a glitch, it’s divine timing. This retrograde asks you to <em>redefine success</em> on your terms. Maybe you’re not as excited about that promotion as you thought you’d be. Maybe a long-held goal no longer fits who you’re becoming. Jupiter in Cancer wants to root your ambitions in emotional truth, not external validation. You might find yourself craving a softer, more sustainable way of showing up in the world — one that honors your boundaries, your rest, your art. Let the discomfort guide you home. </p>



<p>The Moon in Virgo from November 13 to 15 activates your healing and subconscious sector, making this a powerful time to retreat, recalibrate, and listen to the whispers within. You don’t need to explain your absence. You don’t need to earn your stillness. Let this lunar energy be a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/staycation-digital-detox-personal-essay"">permission slip to say no, log off, close the tab</a>, and take the long way home. You are allowed to rest in the in-between. The clarity will come — but not if you chase it. Let it find you in the quiet. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio</a>, Mercury begins its retrograde in Sagittarius on November 9, in your money, values, and self-worth sector, and this one’s hitting close to home — literally and emotionally. It might bring some financial delays or confusion: think forgotten payments, tech glitches with invoices, or miscommunications around collaborations. But beyond the surface-level chaos, this is a deeply clarifying period. Mercury’s slowdown is asking: What do you <em>actually value</em>? Are you hustling out of fear instead of alignment? This retrograde wants to help you reassess your entire relationship with abundance. Maybe what you need isn’t more… maybe it’s a better understanding of what “enough” means for you now. </p>



<p>Then on 11/11, Jupiter begins its retrograde in Cancer, in your expansion, travel, and spiritual wisdom sector — and this is big. You may feel a sudden urge to cancel a trip, re-route a plan, or pull back from something you once thought was your “big break.” Let it happen. Jupiter’s moonlit retrograde is less about going somewhere and more about <em>returning</em> — to a truth, a purpose, or even an ancestor’s whisper you’ve been too busy to hear. You don’t have to chase enlightenment. You can live it in the quiet rituals, the daydreams, the pauses. This is the kind of transit that asks: What beliefs are outdated? What stories about yourself no longer fit who you’re becoming? </p>



<p>From November 13 to 15, the Moon in Virgo <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/friendships"">energizes your community, friendship</a>, and long-term vision sector, and it’s here to help you sift through the noise. You’re realizing which social circles genuinely support your evolution and which ones subtly hold you back. Take stock of who you’re spending your precious time with. Are your connections reciprocal, or are you always the one holding space? Let the Virgo Moon guide you to organize your goals into tangible steps — no need for perfection. Just discernment, honesty, and a soft plan to carry you through these retrograde waters. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, Mercury begins its final retrograde of the year in your sign on November 9, and you’ll likely feel it in your bones before you can name it. You might suddenly second-guess things you once felt 100% sure about: your image, your direction, even how you’ve been showing up lately. This isn’t a punishment, it’s a mirror. Mercury retrograde in your sign is like a cosmic mic check: Are your words aligned with your beliefs? Have your intentions kept up with your growth? If you’re misunderstood or if your message gets lost in translation this week, don’t panic. Take it as a signal to fine tune, not silence. You’re evolving. Your truth is too. </p>



<p>Then on 11/11, Jupiter retrogrades in Cancer, activating your sector of intimacy, shared resources, and emotional entanglements, and things get deep. A past entanglement, contract, or collaboration might resurface, and it’s not necessarily to restart it, but to reflect. This could be about <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/personal-loans-real-examples"">money you loaned</a>, energy you overextended, or emotional investments that didn’t yield what you expected. Jupiter’s message here is loud: It’s time to reclaim your power by reexamining the places where you’ve over-given or under-valued your own needs. You might also feel a pull to tend to ancestral healing — themes of trust, survival, and legacy could come up, and they’re not here to haunt you, but to free you. </p>



<p>As the Moon moves through Virgo from November 13 to 15, your career and reputation sector lights up with earthy precision. While everything else may feel foggy or slowed down by retrogrades, this lunar transit helps you <em>ground your goals</em>. Clean up your calendar. Edit that proposal. Check your online bios — they might need updating. It’s not about doing more, it’s about doing better. You’re learning to build a life that fits the version of you that’s emerging, not the one who was hustling out of habit. Let this week guide you to work smarter, live slower, and speak more intentionally. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, Mercury begins its final retrograde of the year on November 9, in Sagittarius, your sector of spirituality, solitude, and endings. This one’s a little slippery. You may feel unusually foggy, sleepy, or overstimulated and disoriented all at once. It’s because your mind is trying to do what your spirit hasn’t caught up with yet. This is a week for remembering that not everything needs to be shared, explained, or understood immediately. Mercury retrograde is asking you to hit pause on external obligations and listen to your inner world. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/recurring-dreams-meaning"">Dreams may get weirder</a>. Gut instincts stronger. You’re shedding thought patterns you didn’t realize were weighing you down. Let it happen in layers. </p>



<p>Then on the sacred 11/11 portal, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter retrograde shifts into Cancer</a>, in your sector of relationships and contracts. Whether it’s a romantic partner, a business agreement, or an old commitment that’s expired, this transit is here to bring it all back to the surface. If something feels unfinished — it is. But this is not about reopening old wounds just to relive them. It’s about integrating what you’ve learned. This transit may challenge you to confront where you’ve overextended yourself in partnerships or allowed resentment to fester under the surface. On the flip side, it may illuminate where you’ve been too guarded to let real intimacy in. Either way, the invitation is to reimagine how you relate — not from survival, but from reciprocity. <br /><br />From November 13 to 15, the Moon in Virgo lights up your sector of truth, travel, and expansion. You may find yourself craving an escape, but not necessarily a physical one. This might be the week you get lost in a book, sign up for a course, or revisit a philosophy that once anchored you. It’s the perfect time to assess what you’ve outgrown and what still resonates. Virgo’s clarity will help you map out the next leg of your soul journey… just don’t rush to have it all figured out. Let your sense of direction come from stillness, not pressure. You’re growing in silence this week, and it’s exactly what you need. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury begins its final retrograde</a> of the year on November 9, in Sagittarius, your sector of community, vision, and long-term goals. If you’ve been go-go-go with big ideas, collaborations, or social media visibility, this is your cue to pause and reassess. Are you creating from your truth, or just trying to keep up? Mercury retrograde might bring a few tech glitches, scheduling delays, or misunderstandings among friends or team members. But it’s also a golden opportunity to get real about where your energy is going and why. Use this transit to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-2025-zodiac-signs"">revise your vision board</a> — metaphorically or literally. Who are you becoming, and who do you need around you to help make that future feel real? </p>



<p>Then comes 11/11, the astro-numerological portal, and with it, Jupiter retrogrades into Cancer, your sector of wellness, service, and daily rituals. This is less about productivity and more about sustainability. Jupiter here wants you to zoom out and ask: Is the way I live each day aligned with how I say I want to feel? Are you overgiving at work or neglecting your body’s requests for rest, nourishment, and movement? Maybe it’s time to simplify your routine, or even re-evaluate the kind of work you’re doing entirely. This transit might stir memories of past jobs, health routines, or caretaking roles that shaped your current reality — not to haunt you, but to help you release what’s no longer needed. </p>



<p>From November 13 to 15, the Moon in Virgo lands in your sector of intimacy, trust, and emotional transformation. You may find yourself quietly craving deeper connection, not just with others, but with the parts of yourself you’ve avoided. The Virgo Moon wants you to cleanse. This could look like journaling through a fear, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/budgeting-tools-spending-diary"">organizing your finances</a>, or even deleting an old situationship’s number once and for all. Let this be a ritual of release. Mercury may be retrograde, but clarity is still available — especially when you’re honest about what you’ve outgrown. Make room for intimacy that feels like ease, not performance. You deserve that. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, Mercury begins its retrograde journey in Sagittarius on November 9, activating your career, visibility, and life direction sector. This <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-is-deja-vu-meaning"">could feel like déjà vu</a> in the workplace, where past projects resurface or delayed recognition finally makes its way to you, but with strings attached. You may find yourself rethinking your goals or even reconsidering what “success” looks like for you. Are you chasing someone else’s version of accomplishment? Or is it time to give yourself permission to redefine what lights you up? Double-check important emails and deadlines, but also check in with your higher self — she might be whispering a totally different route forward. </p>



<p>Then comes 11/11, and your planetary ruler Jupiter retrogrades into Cancer, in your sector of creativity, romance, and self-expression. This is where the magic gets personal. A love from the past could resurface, not necessarily for reunion, but for reflection. You might feel pulled back into old creative dreams you once abandoned, wondering, “What if?” Jupiter’s slow dance in Cancer invites you to nurture your inner child and revisit the art forms or love stories that once brought you joy. If you’re a parent or mentor, this could be a healing period for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/millennial-aunts-uncles-nibling-social-media"">bonding with the young people</a> in your life, or with your own youthful spirit. Let yourself be moved. </p>



<p>From November 13 to 15, the Moon in Virgo illuminates your relationship and one-on-one connection sector. It’s a clarifying lunar moment that may reveal where boundaries need adjusting, or where walls need softening. Whether you’re single, partnered, or in something undefined, the Virgo Moon brings discernment without coldness. Take this time to have the talk, send the email, or write the letter (even if you never send it). You’re learning to show up more authentically in partnership, but also to honor your solitude. Clarity is not closure, it’s a doorway. Walk through with grace. </p>

<p>When <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/04/196438/nina-simone-rock-hall-induction-beyonce-tribute-lauryn-hill-sister-rosetta-tharpe"">Nina Simone</a> said “an artist’s duty, as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times,” she wasn’t referring to only the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/most-impactful-tv-shows"">moments in history</a> that feel like sunshine and roses. The iconic singer and activist meant the dark and ugly parts, too. </p>



<p>Lately, however, there’s been an alarming trend of people in power <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVG7PNTZbtM"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">censoring art that reflects reality</a>. Just recently, Apple TV postponed the release of <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jessica-chastain-the-savant-delay-will-it-be-released-apple-1236406858/""><em>The</em> <em>Savant</em></a><em> </em>in the weeks following Charlie Kirk’s assassination. The series follows an investigator (Jessica Chastain) who interferes with white supremacist organizations before mass shootings occur. In a statement to <a href=""https://deadline.com/2025/09/jessica-chastain-does-not-agree-apple-the-savant-postponed-1236554606/"">Deadline</a>, a spokesperson for the streaming platform said, “After careful consideration, we have made the decision to postpone The Savant,” adding that it would be released at a later date. <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jessica-chastain-the-savant-delay-will-it-be-released-apple-1236406858/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chastain expressed her disappointment</a> on Instagram, stating that “we’ve seen an unfortunate amount of violence in the United States” since they began making the show five years ago. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11942017.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=427&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A427"" /></figure>



<p>This is just one example of Hollywood executives <a href=""https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/after-jimmy-kimmels-show-was-suspended-a-key-question-is-does-the-fcc-have-the-power-to-regulate-speech"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">canceling or suspending shows</a> and movies seemingly in immediate response to headlines of the day. Their statements may be broad, and their actions may do little more than appease shareholders, but the consistent <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62le8q959yo"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">attacks on freedom of speech</a> and expression through the arts do nothing but hold the entertainment industry — and society — back.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s worth praising the TV shows and films that confront the times instead of running from them. These are the best series and movies that have refused to shy away from the social and political climates they were made in. </p>

<h2><strong><em>Fruitvale Station </em></strong>(2013)</h2>







<p>The world was introduced to the genius of Ryan Coogler through <em>Fruitvale Station</em>, a poignant film that highlights the final day of Oscar Grant’s life. Portrayed by Michael B. Jordan, Grant was <a href=""https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/10-years-since-oscar-grant-s-death-what-13489585.php"">killed at age 22</a> on New Years Day in 2009 by Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer Johannes Mehserle. The killing occurred in Oakland, California — Coogler’s hometown — but the film resonated across the nation, and with timely reason: It debuted one year after the killing of Trayvon Martin, an event that sparked protests nationwide and ignited the Black Lives Matter movement in a formal way. State-sanctioned and racist violence was all too common, yet it had been long ignored on the silver screen. Coogler’s directorial debut shined a light on the deadly cost of institutionalized racism that the United States has yet to contend with. <strong><em>Watch now on Prime Video.</em></strong></p>

<h2><strong><em>Watchmen </em></strong>(2019)</h2>







<p>Regina King is the true hero of this HBO limited series, adapted from the DC Comics graphic novels of the same name. Though <em>Watchmen</em> is set in a present-day alternate universe, it’s based on the true horrors of the <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tulsa-race-massacre-100-years_n_60a574b2e4b0313547925c09"">Tulsa Race Massacre</a> that took place in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1921, in which white supremacists targeted an area of town known as Black Wall Street for its thriving Black-owned businesses. Unlike in reality, the descendants of the massacre receive reparations, leaving resentment amongst the white supremacist group known as the Seventh Kavalry. King is a masked vigilante on a mission to put an end to the group’s pattern of racial violence. <em>Watchmen</em> also stars Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Jeremy Irons, and Jean Smart as their characters must confront their own ethics in ways they’ve never had to before.. This nine-episode series is a masterclass in rich, nuanced storytelling about the traumas that wounds inflicted from racism hold — and the inherited pain that ensues if not addressed head-on. With the resurfacing of white nationalism and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/22/us-black-history-dei"">erasure of historical facts </a>on federal and state levels, this prescient show is absolutely worth a rewatch today. <strong><em>Stream now on HBO Max.</em></strong></p>

<h2><strong><em>One Battle After Another </em></strong>(2025)</h2>







<p>There’s a reason Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest has been heralded as one of the best films of 2025 while also spinning <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/one-battle-after-another-conservative-reactions-1236394128/"">conservatives into a tizzy</a>. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Teyana Taylor, and Chase Infiniti, and highlights the cost and complexities of serving as part of a revolution. Though <em>One Battle After Another</em> doesn’t specify what the protagonists are fighting for other than freedom, it’s evident that patriarchal and white supremacists systems are a known enemy. (Sound familiar?) The film tackles racism, sexism, xenophobia, and classism as the main characters reunite after decades of inactivity in the effort to save the daughter of one of their own. A secondary plot focusing on immigrant rights reflects the reality of so many people and families who have recently been targeted by ICE raids under Trump’s regime; markedly, the film spares no punches in its depiction of this violence. <strong>One Battle After Another<em> is in theaters now with a digital release date of November 20.</em></strong></p>

<h2><strong><em>The Morning Show </em></strong>(4 seasons, 2019-present)</h2>







<p>Season after season, this Apple TV series understands the assignment. Starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, <em>The Morning Show</em> is a novel depiction of the inner workings of the media, this time from a nationally syndicated morning show on a major network. Each season, these journalists are impacted personally and professionally by major events happening in the world, from the #MeToo movement to the pandemic to the rise of artificial intelligence. Throughout the series, they must contend with a changing media landscape that leads to layoffs and a challenging environment for journalism to thrive. Watching this four-season show can be triggering for those working in the industry. Binge at your own risk.<strong><em> Stream now on AppleTV.</em></strong></p>

<h2><strong><em>Adolescence</em></strong> (2024)</h2>







<p>This Netflix original is an uncomfortably ugly ride that exposes the life-threatening dangers of the digital manosphere. Owen Cooper plays a 13-year-old named Jaime, who — despite coming from a solid home with a seemingly normal foundation — is arrested for killing a female classmate who declined his advances. The four-episode series is a devastating depiction of how the dark corners of social media and the internet at large are <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/oct/21/why-the-manosphere-clicked-for-young-men-a-visual-deep-dive"">radicalizing young men</a> today. <strong><em>Stream now on</em></strong> <em><strong>Netflix.</strong></em></p>

<h2><strong><em>Her</em></strong><strong> </strong>(2013)</h2>







<p><em>Her</em> isn’t a horror film — but it might soon become a documentary, as a recent Vantage Point Counseling Services study showed that almost a third of Americans have admitted to having an <a href=""https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/americans-romantic-relationships-ai-chatbot-study-b2838217.html"">intimate or romantic relationship</a> with an AI chatbot. That is more or less the premise of this film, which stars Joaquin Phoenix as the lonely and introverted Theodore Twombly. Fresh off a divorce, Theodore falls in love with Samantha, a chatbot voiced by Scarlett Johansson. Though the Spike Jonze feature premiered more than a decade ago, it eerily predicted the moment in time we currently live in, particularly as a <a href=""https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/usable-knowledge/24/10/what-causing-our-epidemic-loneliness-and-how-can-we-fix-it"">loneliness epidemic</a> and advancements in generative AI converge. <strong><em>Watch now on Netflix.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em></strong> (6 seasons, 2017-2025)</h2>







<p>Watching this dystopian Hulu series is sombering, especially in a post-<em>Roe v. Wade </em>society. Based on Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, the Emmy-winning series takes place in the Republic of Gilead, a totalitarian nation that was once the United States. Its power-hungry men have made laws that subjugate women to follow an extreme set of laws that essentially gives the government total control of their bodies. It is illegal for them to read, vote, divorce, and freely express themselves in any way. June Osborne (Elizabeth Moss) is one of the few fertile women left in Gilead; for this, she is captured, enslaved, and forced to become a surrogate for a Commander and his wife. The torture, abuse, and dehumanizing conditions these characters experience make this show a hard watch, especially as lawmakers <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/health/usaid-contraceptives-destroyed-trump.html"">continue to police</a> <a href=""https://19thnews.org/2025/09/texas-abortion-pill-ban/"">and chip away</a> <a href=""https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2025/09/birth-control-incorrectly-labeled-as-abortifacients-by-trump-administration.html"">at women’s reproductive rights</a> at the federal and local level. <strong><em>Stream now on Hulu.</em></strong></p>

<h2><strong><em>The Last Black Man in San Francisco</em></strong> (2019)</h2>







<p>Gentrification has been a hot button topic for quite some time, but seeing how it’s depicted in <em>The Last Black Man in San Francisco</em> gives the conversation around it a fresh lens. The film centers on Jimmie Fails, a third-generation San Franciscan holding onto the Victorian home his grandfather supposedly built despite it no longer belonging to his family. When the home’s white former tenants vacate, Jimmie moves out of his friend’s apartment in a low-income neighborhood that’s built on toxic waste and begins squatting. The realities of the movie continue to this day: As the cost of living in one of the country’s <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/16/income-needed-to-live-comfortably-in-most-expensive-us-cities.html"">most expensive cities</a> continues to rise, <a href=""https://capitalbnews.org/black-displacement-gentrification-watts-study/"">communities established by people of color</a> have only become whiter and whiter. This Sundance Film Festival winner maintains its relevancy as Black and Brown neighborhoods across the country contend with what “home” looks like when so many of their neighbors are being displaced. <strong><em>Rent now on Prime Video or AppleTV.</em></strong></p>



<h2><strong><em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em></strong> (2018)</h2>







<p>Barry Jenkins masterfully adapts James Baldwin’s novel of the same name into the beautiful love story. Fonny and Tish are a young, Black couple from Harlem. Their relationship is tragically interrupted when Fonny is falsely accused of raping a white woman and thrown in prison. Though the film depicts the tragedy of mass incarceration and corruption, it takes care to treat the families impacted by these systemic travesties with  sophistication and dignity. The moral of <em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em> is that no matter what systems try to break love, its resiliency is undeniable.<strong><em> Watch now on Prime Video.</em></strong></p>



<h2><strong><em>The Big Short</em></strong> (2015)</h2>







<p>The housing crisis took place in 2008 but Adam McKay’s <em>The Big Short</em> still feels eerily relevant. Starring Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, and Brad Pitt, it takes a comedic approach to explaining how a group of investors predicted that a crash was coming and bet against the banks. They won big while the rest of the country went into an economic downward spiral. The Oscar-winning film depicted the role Wall Street’s greed played in causing The Great Recession. While other factors certainly contributed to the economic realities of 2008 and the following years, the film still hits as today’s everyday Americans increasingly feel financial strain. <strong><em>Watch now on Paramount+</em></strong>.</p>

<h2><strong><em>Don’t Look Up</em></strong> (2021)</h2>







<p>As a comet hurls towards Earth, two astronomers (Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence) try to warn the global population in this Adam McKay-directed film. Few are taking this death star seriously, however — including the U.S. president. <em>Don’t Look Up </em>follows DiCaprio and Lawrence’s charaters as they take matters into their own hands and warn the general public. Political hijinks ensues as the comet becomes a divisive issue rather than a rallying cry for action. Though a comet is the big threat in this film, it feels like a metaphor for many things, including the looming dangers of climate change and the gullibility of viewers who believe something is “fake news” because a politician told them so. <strong><em>Watch now on Netflix. </em></strong></p>

<h2><strong><em>Severance</em></strong> (2 seasons, 2022-present)</h2>







<p>This Emmy Award-winning Apple TV series premiered after the onset of the Covid pandemic and the work-from-home era, when many Americans had the time to assess their relationship with their work. Seasons don’t exist in the cold and dreary town run by Lumon, the company that sells the dream of a true work-life balance by literally severing their personalities into two. Their workplaces selves (innies) don’t know anything about their outside selves (outies). What initially seems like the ideal technology becomes an actual living hell for a group of employees who have effectively lost their free will. <strong><em>Stream now on AppleTV.</em></strong></p>

<h2><strong><em>The Wire</em></strong> (5 seasons, 2002-2009)</h2>







<p>A hallmark of prestige television since the moment it debuted in 2002, <em>The Wire</em> should be required viewing for anyone looking to pursue careers in law enforcement, journalism, local government, or the legal field. Set in Baltimore, the HBO original chronicles institutions on each side of the drug trade and examines how cops, drug dealers, reporters, lawyers, teachers, and blue-collar workers are all connected by the same system. Creator David Simon paints a vivid picture of the toll political corruption, racism, and addiction take on both individual people and the entire city. Though specific to the Maryland city in its accents and details, the show’s message easily applies to other urban cities across the country. <strong><em>Stream now on HBO Max.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>After The Hunt</em></strong> (2025)</h2>







<p><em>After The Hunt</em> poses a frustratingly timeless question: Who gets to be the perfect victim? Ayo Edebiri stars as Maggie Price, a queer Black student at Yale University whose family is filthy rich. This complex background — a mix of privilege and marginalization — as well as her suspected missteps call her integrity into question after she accuses a male instructor of raping her. Julia Roberts plays Alma Olsson, Maggie’s professor and mentor, who has to make a decision: Support her mentee as Maggie seeks to hold her abuser accountable, or side with her colleague with whom she shares romantic chemistry. The film challenges assumptions as it holds an uncomfortable mirror to the ways in which modern society still views consent and cancel culture.<strong> After the Hunt <em>was in theaters in October and will be released digitally on PrimeVideo soon.</em></strong></p>

<h2><em><strong>I May Destroy You </strong></em><strong>(1 season, 2020)</strong></h2>







<p>The series created by and starring Michaela Coel premiered two years after bombshell allegations against Hollywood mega-producer Harvey Weinstein thrust Tarana Burke’s #MeToo movement into the national spotlight and sparked widespread conversations about sexual assault, harassment, and survivorhood. It’s a visceral but necessary watch. The show centers on three main characters as they navigate what it means to heal after being subjected to sexual violence. In just one season, <em>I May Destroy You</em> tackled the messy, dark, harrowing reality of what it means to process sexual assault and maintain a sense of your own agency as a survivor. <strong><em>Stream now on HBO Max.</em></strong></p>

<p>Jupiter, the planet of divine wisdom and luck, will be moonwalking in the water sign Cancer <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">from November</a> 11, 2025 (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-11-11-angel-number-november-2023"">11/11 is the 1111 portal</a> to success — hopefully that transcends to the overall energy of Jupiter retrograde…fingers crossed) to March 11, 2026. The next four months will be when we rethink what makes us secure and safe, which is unraveling because the expansive planet is moving more slowly, making matters seem more difficult and bigger than they need to be. Reassessing relationships and family dynamics will be a big story during the holiday season and Valentine’s Day, since we are determining who and what we wish to take into the new year with us. We have gained insight into the actual colors and motives of others; now, we must plan how we should move forward. <br /><br />Although we like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-in-cancer-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Jupiter in Cancer</a> (this is the sign of Jupiter’s exaltation), the flipside is that it can also harm our lives. Jupiter always takes big swings and makes huge bets to win large. The caveat is that we’ll get minimal returns on investments and wagers. The stakes are high, so don’t play in a higher bracket and above our capabilities to ensure we lose less. The same applies to relationships — protecting our energy and deciphering who we let into our hearts ensures that we won’t hurt when it comes to romantic partnerships and friendships. Another theme at play is travel. Jupiter retrograde might make us stay close to home, harness delays, or cause us to be in closer proximity to family. </p>



<p>The planetary backspin occurs amidst two <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrogrades</a> — that’s right, this transit will add to the intensity. The Mercurial backspin from November 9 to 29 in Sagittarius <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">and Scorpio</a> gets immense drama from Jupiter’s backward rotation. We’ll be more reflective than usual and unsure about our circumstances. The Mercury retrograde that backstrokes in Pisces from February 26 to March 20 makes our emotions extremely tender. We may have to cry out our sentiments to release them. Carry a pack of tissues everywhere in case they are needed because the slightest comments or annoyances could set us off at these times.<br /><br />Other planets, such as Saturn and Neptune in Pisces, and Uranus in Taurus will also be retrograde for the majority of the time. As a result, we’ll be apt to be in an ocean of emotions. It’ll be hard to set our sights on newness, as the cosmos are pulling us backward. The tides are high, resulting in cautious behavior. There will be moments when we act on impulsive, but it’s advisable to meditate on matters a few times before taking charge. <br /><br />As with all retrogrades, prepare for the unexpected. Go with the flow to ensure smooth sailing. Doing so can make a huge difference because we won’t overthink or stress so hard. Good luck! </p>



<h2>Important Dates:</h2>



<p><strong>November 17:</strong> Jupiter retrograde in Cancer harmonizes with the Sun in Scorpio, giving us a chance to take a step back and see ourselves clearly. <br /><br /><strong>November 22:</strong> Jupiter retrograde in Cancer connects with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrograde in Scorpio</a>, making us sentimental and longing for the past. <br /><br /><strong>November 26:</strong> Jupiter retrograde in Cancer trines <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-scorpio-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Venus in Scorpio</a>, intensifying our emotions and desire to connect with others. <br /><br /><strong>December 6:</strong> Jupiter retrograde in Cancer and Mercury retrograde in Scorpio sync up again, retracing the actions and decision of the previous weeks. <br /><br /><strong>January 9, 2026:</strong> Jupiter retrograde in Cancer opposes Venus in Capricorn, pushing us to take risks that may or may not be victorious. <br /><br /><strong>January 10, 2026:</strong> Jupiter retrograde in Cancer juxtaposes the Sun in Capricorn, amplifying our strength and vitality. <br /><br /><strong>January 10, 2026:</strong> Jupiter retrograde in Cancer aspects Mars in Capricorn, adding energy and gusto our auras. <br /><br /><strong>January 14, 2026:</strong> Jupiter retrograde in Cancer links up with Mercury in Capricorn, intensifying miscommunications and travel delays. <br /><br /><strong>February 16, 2026:</strong> Jupiter retrograde in Cancer dances with Mercury in Pisces, allowing us to be more sensitive to others and ourselves. <br /><br /><strong>February 22, 2026:</strong> Jupiter retrograde in Cancer and Venus in Pisces get nostalgic, enticing us to reach out to those that made an impression upon us back in the day. <br /><br /><strong>March 5, 2026:</strong> Jupiter retrograde in Cancer and the Sun in Pisces, boosting our self-confidence and rizz. <br /><br /><strong>March 9, 2026:</strong> Jupiter retrograde in Cancer and Mercury retrograde in Pisces, establishing re-communication with old flames and acquaintances. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941439.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>PSA: The final <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9903579/is-mercury-retrograde-bad"">Mercury retrograde</a> of 2025 is the messiest. The optical illusion, which is caused by Mercury’s slow motion, causes disruption and disorder to earthlings. The disruptive transit affects us so much that it’s become impossible to ignore and part of our modern lexicon. This month, we’ll be drowning in the theatrics — make sure your life preserver is fastened. <br /><br />At the same time, four other planets are moonwalking in the cosmos: Jupiter (which turns retrograde on November 11), Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Prep for emo interactions with people we’ve long forgotten or resentments to come out into the open. We will not be able to get a hold of our words, resulting in us saying potentially offensive statements that we’ll regret. So, don’t drunk dial, email, text, DM, or lurk your ex’s social media after a few cocktails with friends from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">November 9 to 29</a>, expecting them to be empathetic or vice versa.</p>



<p>Before November 9, the pre-retrograde began on October 21 in Sagittarius. Look at the dates from October 21 to November 9 to determine the story that will consume the most energy during the retrograde. This is the first time we trace over the degrees. We dive into the retrograde backtracking on these degrees. When the retrograde is over, we move forward and deal with the same degrees one last time from November 29 to December 16, when the planet moves back to the place and sign it was in on October 21. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-november-2024-meaning-effects"">T</a>his third moment is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-november-2024-meaning-effects"">referred to as “retroshade”</a> because we are making final decisions based on the discoveries and observations made in the past weeks. Now that Mercury is direct, we can assess matters with a keen eye. <br /><br />Mercury retrograde in Sagittarius can make us more erratic and demanding. Basically, we’ll have no chill. We may become highly reactive and less reasonable, resulting in irrational exchanges with others. When Mercury backs up <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">into Scorpio</a>, it’ll allow us to understand relationships and our feelings after several hours or days of introspection. Our spy senses are overactive, leading to paranoia. The key to calm is to not crash over a tidbit of gossip. Handle it like a boss and discuss it openly with a heavy heart. </p>



<p>Mercury’s backpedal starts with a conjunction to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Mars in Sagittarius</a> on November 12, setting the stage for an argument due to a confrontation over a misunderstanding. Mercury retrograde links up with Pluto in Aquarius on November 17, piling onto the issues from the 12th, a few days later. Matters can reach a fever pitch on the 17th, so tread lightly and don’t let conversations get too out of control. Mercury moves back into Scorpio on November 19, but moments after, Uranus retrograde in Taurus and Neptune retrograde in Pisces reveal secrets. The Sun forms a conjunction to Mercury retrograde on the 20th, a few hours before the New Moon. Saturn retrograde in Pisces and Jupiter retrograde in Cancer try to add structure to the vibe on November 22. However, we will break boundaries on the 24th when Venus and Mercury retrograde in Scorpio come together, forcing us to deal with situations and people from the old days. <br /><br />Yes, this Mercury retrograde is going to be tough. The best way to thrive is not to gaslight ourselves. Acknowledging our feelings and not compromising our needs could create conflict with those not ready to hear them. We shouldn’t hold back our sentiments to avoid drama and to make others happy. Speaking our truth and being as direct as possible during <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-aries-pisces-march-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrograde</a> is vital. We must clarify and simplify words several times to get our points across. IKYK miscommunications are rampant, so checking messages before sending for typos is essential. There could also be travel issues, so allotting ourselves an extra half hour to get to a destination helps lessen anxiety and stress. <br /><br />This Mercurial moonwalk is going to fuel our tempers and emotions. All of the watery planets are making us long for the past. Just because the moment has slipped away doesn’t mean the merit is gone. The universe is giving us another chance to mend fences, heal our hearts, and look back and right our wrongs or attempt to make good on former promises. The Mercurial reckoning is here — are you ready? </p>
