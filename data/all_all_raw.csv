<p>Architecture has always played a key role in providing shelter and protection for human beings. In prehistoric times, we sought refuge in caves, taking advantage of rock structures for protection against the natural elements and predators. Over time, shelters began to be made from materials found in nature, such as branches, leaves, and animal skins, evolving into more permanent and complex homes, with walls made of stone, bricks or wood, roofs to protect against rain and sun, and doors to control access. As we developed more advanced building skills, we used materials such as wood, stone, and clay and architecture evolved significantly, with the construction of temples, palaces, and fortifications that provided not only shelter but also symbolized power, status, and cultural identity. Even so, our buildings can continue to be seen as shells that protect us from the outside world. </p>",

You stay in your lane!&quot;</p><p>Meanwhile, the business keeps moving ahead and amidst rounds of layoffs, there's a truth that we're not acknowledging:</p><blockquote>Research is irrelevant if it doesn't serve the Business.</blockquote><h3>The methods distraction: Quant vs Qual</h3><p>As the conversation progressed, we got back to the tried and true Quant vs. Qual debate, this time, with the nuance that &quot;Market Research works mainly in Quant&quot; and &quot;UX Research works mainly in Qual.&quot; Maybe it does.</p><p><strong>And maybe, it doesn't actually matter at all.</strong> I've seen Quant-focused UX studies (like Jobs to be Done) and Qual-focused ethnographic Market Research studies (Ever notice that Marketing always have more budget than the product teams?).</p><p>Mixed methods researchers claim they can do both. And it’s true. We toggle between qual and quant to answer different questions as the need arises... But it's still missing the point.</p><p>Why does ownership of methods matter to practitioners? It doesn’t matter to your CEO, that’s for certain. The deeper question is: What decisions are we trying to inform? And who ultimately benefits?</p><blockquote>What actually matters? Making data-informed decisions<strong> </strong>that fuel business outcomes.</blockquote><p>The reality is that researchers are not just out there gathering data that we present as insights and recommendations. We influence decisions about the product. And in today’s economic landscape, every decision that matters is, ultimately, a <em>business</em> decision.</p><h3>Product decisions are business decisions</h3><p>This point deserves its own section… The question came up next as to how to define &quot;Research.&quot; Ok, here's my attempt:</p><blockquote><em>Research (Both UX and Market Research) is</em> <em>the process</em> <em>of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting Customer and Product data to make Business decisions.</em></blockquote><p>This triad (Customer, Product, Business), comes together in <em>Product Truth</em>. It’s the intersection between what customers need your product to do, what you promise it does, and what it actually delivers.</p><figure><img alt=""Venn diagram of product truth showing the intersections of Business, Product, and Customer"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*f4OjHPoamhImzyLjmUc1sw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>When there is alignment between these three: Great! You're on the path to success. But when there's a breakdown… Watch out!</p><p>When you build products using only one or two of the lenses, you risk making flawed decisions:</p><ul><li>Business + Product (without Customer): Leads to commercially viable but irrelevant products.</li><li>Business + Customer (without Product): Creates desirable but unfeasible solutions.</li><li>Product + Customer (without Business): Results in great UX with no path to profitability.</li></ul><p>Misalignment can lead to product failure. But Research plays a unique role: it illuminates the missing perspectives, allowing insights to become a bridge into business strategy.</p><h3>Tough love</h3><p>If I could go back in time, I wouldn’t tell my younger self to learn another methodology or get better at stakeholder management.</p><blockquote>If I could go back in time, I’d give myself one piece of advice: “Care more about the business.”</blockquote><p>I used to think my job was to advocate for the user. And while that’s still true, but it’s a smaller part of the equation than I thought. Advocating for users without understanding the business context is like drawing a map without knowing where your destination is.</p><h3>Want to become essential?</h3><p>I think we all want to be seen as essential to the business… to grow in our careers, to thrive, and to make more money ourselves. And the first step is really simple:</p><ul><li>You want job security? <strong>Help the business make money.</strong></li><li>You want more influence on product decisions? <strong>Help the business make money.</strong></li><li>You want to create more ethical, human-centered products? <strong>Help the business make money</strong>, ideally, in a way that <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/human-flourishing-in-the-age-of-ai-b456b1de31c7"">supports human flourishing</a>.</li></ul><p>That’s how you become essential.</p><p>That’s how you stay in the loop.</p><p>And that’s how you go from being perceived as a cost center to being a profit center… In essence, a <em>strategic partner</em>.</p><h3>Stop arguing and focus on the business</h3><p>This is the moment for UX and Market Research to unite under a shared mission: Helping businesses make human-centered decisions that drive growth.</p><p>We are not against each other. We are collaborators in solving the same problem from different angles, sometimes using the same methods, and always bringing our unique education and background experience to the table to inform how we interpret and make sense of Customer and Product data.</p><p>It's time to stop arguing about who owns the data or which method or discipline is superior.</p><p>Instead, let’s focus on building a future where data is at the core of every strategic business decision.</p><p>Because that’s the only way we all win: Together.</p><p><strong>Josh LaMar</strong> is the Co-Founder and CEO of <a href=""https://amplinate.com/"">Amplinate</a>, an international agency focusing on cross-cultural Research &amp; Design.

A rule tightens, choices narrow, and it still feels like someone watching out for us. But the moment we’re told which questions are acceptable, the story stops being something we believe and becomes something we’re permitted to follow.</p><p><em>I’m </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/natesowder/""><em>Nate Sowder</em></a><em>, and this is </em><strong><em>unquoted, installment 14</em></strong><em>. This week, we’re looking at</em><a href=""https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-Baldwin""><em> James Baldwin</em></a><em> and the dynamics of controlling systems.</em></p><h3>Baldwin before Baldwin</h3><p>James Baldwin grew up in Harlem in the 1930s, in a neighborhood where the church was often the only institution offering structure, identity and a sense of direction. His stepfather was a preacher… strict, volatile, convinced the world was dangerous and that discipline was the only defense against it. Baldwin was taught early that love and fear could sound the same from the pulpit, and that protection could arrive in a tone that felt indistinguishable from control.</p><p>By adolescence, he was already <a href=""https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/james-baldwin"">writing</a>, already watching, already noticing how authority behaves when it’s anxious. He saw how parents and pastors tightened their grip (not because they were strong, but) when they were afraid… afraid of the world outside, afraid of losing their children to it, afraid of questions that didn’t have answers prescriptively laid out.</p><p>The punchline is that Baldwin left the church, but he never stopped studying its logic: the way belief gets inherited, the way fear gets institutionalized (let that sink in), and the way people learn to live inside systems that claim to protect them while shaping them into something… relatively insignificant.</p><p>What made Baldwin, <a href=""https://press.princeton.edu/ideas/james-baldwins-reckless-idea?srsltid=AfmBOoq3aGh7HlIOybdMwX47r4Ou62HOfMIWk2vdBNKZ2AiU4RtFowoI"">Baldwin wasn’t doctrine or theory. </a>Instead, it was his ability to see how systems (families, churches, nations, etc.) reveal their deepest insecurities in how they try to keep people “safe”. And how, in doing so, they confuse protection with control until the two become nearly indistinguishable.</p><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white photo of James Baldwin standing in a dim room with one hand on his hip.

The light casts his shadow across the wall behind him."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nSgJEuyNPhgi6gSGa3mJAg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>James Baldwin in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France, in 1979. Photo: Pierre Boulat/Cosmos</figcaption></figure><h3>What Baldwin saw</h3><p>What Baldwin carried out of that childhood was clarity about how authority behaves when it feels uneasy. He noticed that the strictest rules often appeared when the people enforcing them felt threatened. When grips tightened, it wasn’t because the world required it; it was because the adults in charge didn’t know what to do with their own uncertainty.</p><p>He grew up watching beliefs passed down without examination, repeated out of habit, fear, or duty. Questioning them didn’t feel dangerous because of the ideas themselves, it felt dangerous because of what those questions exposed: How fragile the underlying certainty really was.</p><p><a href=""https://theconstitutionalist.org/2021/08/19/learning-to-love-like-james-baldwin/"">Baldwin learned that control often exposes the very vulnerability it intends to hide.</a></p><p>This became the thread running through his work. Whether he was writing about families, churches, or nations, he kept returning to the same observation: Systems that depend on obedience are rarely confident in their foundations. They appeal to safety, stability, or virtue, but what they are really protecting is the comfort of not having to reconsider themselves.</p><p>Baldwin didn’t need to catalogue every rule or doctrine. It was sufficient enough studying what people do when they’re afraid to face their own reflection.</p><h3>When fear becomes policy</h3><p>The dynamics Baldwin observed in the church weren’t confined to pulpits or families. You can see the same architecture anywhere a system confuses order with virtue and obedience with stability. Some cultures call it tradition, others morality, and some simply call it policy. But the structure is identical: fear becomes the rationale, and protection becomes the excuse.</p><p>You see it in countries where dissent is treated as contamination. The state offers “safety” in exchange for silence, promising harmony while making independent thought feel hazardous. Citizens learn to measure their words before they measure their ideas. Over time, people don’t become loyal; they become cautious. And while caution is easy to manage, history has shown this isn’t a foundation for stability.</p><p>You see it in religious movements convinced the world is deteriorating and that only strictness can save the next generation. Rules multiply. Curiosity becomes a liability. Children are raised not to understand their beliefs, but to repeat them as if conviction can survive without the capacity to question. It looks devout from the outside, but inside, it’s a culture afraid of the very people it claims to shepherd — held together by the oldest tool available: shame.</p><p>And you see it in political strategies designed to produce dependency. Systems remove options not because citizens can’t handle them, but because the system can’t. Policies become tight, resources shrink and the message becomes unmistakable: trust us, not yourself. The promise sounds like protection or worse: Equality. The effect feels more like containment, and the longer someone stays inside it, the harder it becomes to imagine leaving.</p><p>Across these contexts, fear has the opposite intended effect. It organizes around compliance rather than unity.</p><p>And compliance, once internalized, becomes something far more difficult to undo than force: <strong>it becomes normal.</strong></p><h3>Why control feels necessary</h3><p>Controlling systems (and people buying into it) rarely see themselves as controlling. They see themselves as managing risk. Uncertainty becomes the problem to solve, and predictability becomes the measure of whether the solution is working. Once that logic takes hold, the system begins to interpret any deviation (any question, new idea, independent choice, etc.) as evidence that the threat hasn’t been contained.</p><p>This is how control becomes rationalized.<br />Not moral, not ideological… <em>rational</em>.<br /> <br />A system anxious about its own stability starts treating unpredictability as danger, even when nothing dangerous is happening. Order becomes a proxy for safety. Obedience becomes a proxy for belonging, and the more fragile the system feels internally, the more rigid its rules become externally.</p><ul><li>In families, this shows up as an insistence that “good choices” are the ones that avoid discomfort.</li><li>In organizations, it shows up as leaders mistaking silence for alignment.</li><li>In societies, it shows up as policies built to prevent change rather than manage it.</li></ul><p>The irony is always the same: The tighter a system tries to hold things together, the more it reveals how afraid it is of letting people grow.</p><p>Control is a thing because a system doubts it can survive… not because a system is strong.</p><p><strong>In the end, control survives not on strength, but on the fear of what might happen without it.</strong></p><h3>The stories avoidance hands down</h3><p>Oddly enough, avoidance isn’t neglect. Avoidance is the explanation of which questions are allowed and which ones should never be asked. Every controlling system depends on stories that make it feel responsible. These are stories inherited so early and repeated so often that questioning them starts to feel like a breach. To Baldwin, these weren’t ideas or lessons. These were boundaries.</p><p>You can probably see where this is going.</p><p>The first layer is <strong>tradition</strong>. It hands us practices and expectations framed as stability. But tradition often survives because it saves people from having to examine what might change if they let themselves reconsider… well… tradition. Avoidance hides neatly inside continuity.</p><p><strong>History</strong> is next. Not as a record, but as a curated reassurance. A society (in power) decides which parts of its past are useful, and arranges them <strong>(or deletes them, as you might notice)</strong> accordingly. Once that arrangement feels authoritative, uncertainty becomes harder to entertain. Questioning the narrative reads as destabilizing, even when the narrative was assembled to prevent destabilization in the first place (if you can believe it).</p><p>Then <strong>morality</strong> steps in to seal the deal. Guidance becomes doctrine, doctrine becomes obligation, and obligation becomes a performance of virtue that relies on predictability rather than understanding. Baldwin saw how easily morality can be drafted into the service of avoidance. <strong>What I mean here, is how often systems reward people not for being thoughtful, but for being steady and compliant.</strong></p><p>And now we have a pattern. Avoidance becomes normal. The stories people inherit teach them to not ask questions. They close the space in which doubt can occur, and treat uncertainty as a sign of <strong>personal failure</strong>. The more these habits embed, the less the system needs to enforce anything. People maintain the limits themselves.</p><p>Baldwin’s clarity cuts cleanly here: O<strong>bedient systems train people to fear questions until avoiding them starts to feel like character.</strong></p><p><strong>If this feels like the moment everything clicks… good. We’re not done.</strong></p><h3>What control really creates</h3><p>Once avoidance becomes the operating logic of a system, something predictable happens to the people inside it: They stop developing the instincts they would need to live without the system’s protection. For Baldwin, this was the tragedy of control. It doesn’t just limit what people can do. It limits what they believe themselves capable of understanding.</p><p>When questions are treated as disruptions, people learn to ignore the parts of their lives that don’t fit the approved story.</p><p>People stop examining their assumptions. They stop trusting their own judgment and stop exploring ideas that might complicate the version of themselves the system prefers.</p><p>You know the consequences better than me. People grow uncomfortable with uncertainty. They choose predictability. They confuse obedience with maturity because obedience is the only behavior the system ever rewarded. And when faced with something that requires imagination, or skepticism, or self-direction, they hesitate…</p><p>I don’t think they hesitate because they lack intelligence. I think they hesitate because of a horrible failure that has taken a really long time to take effect.</p><p>Baldwin’s warning was never about the severity of limits. It was about their effect. <strong>Control produces people who expect someone else to name boundaries for them. </strong>Once that expectation settles in, the system doesn’t need to impose its authority. It simply waits for people to stay inside the lines on their own.</p><h3>The cost of making obedience a virtue</h3><p>The longer a system depends on avoidance, the harder it becomes to see the trade-off being made. Over time, people forget that their certainties were handed to them. They begin to speak as though they reached those conclusions on their own. That’s how avoidance starts looking like conviction.</p><p>This is where I think the damage shows up. Systems built on obedience don’t need to enforce much. People begin to manage themselves long after the original authority fades off. They sidestep questions that would be unsettling to the story they inherited. They’re able to seek out and maintain a stability they never chose and participate in their own containment because the alternative (actual examination) feels disloyal to the world that taught them not to question.</p><p>Baldwin leaves us with a hard truth:<br /><strong>Control doesn’t secure a system; It reduces the scale of the people inside it.</strong></p><p>Once that reduction feels normal, the system has very little to maintain. Avoidance passes from one generation to the next, each one repeating the scripts that make obedience sound eerily similar to maturity.</p><p>We tell ourselves we’re protecting what matters.</p><p>But protection without examination is something else entirely. It’s the refusal to imagine what someone might become if they were trusted with their own questions.</p><p><em>Unquoted is a series about the people and their ideas we can’t afford to forget.</em></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=b1eac97329cd"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-stories-that-keep-us-obedient-b1eac97329cd"">The stories that keep us obedient</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>The 19 critical decision moments where human judgment determines whether teams build the right things.</h4><figure><img alt=""Split illustration: left side shows teal circuit board patterns with data icons representing AI automation; right side shows coral-colored hands reaching toward a decision tree, representing human collaboration and judgment.

When I asked, “What problem do these features solve?” silence followed. They could describe what they’d built and how they'd built it. But they couldn’t articulate why any of it mattered to customers.</p><p>It wasn’t incompetence, but rather a loss of clarity in the rush to deliver — a failure of judgment, not execution. I’ve been in that room before — on the other side. I’ve watched teams I led ship features that solved problems no one had previously identified. The hard lesson: executing speed without clear judgment gets you to failure faster. Of course, timely execution remains vital, but discovery judgment has become the actual constraint.</p><p>Teams emphasize that judgment can’t be automated. Yet, AI clearly performs tasks that resemble judgment, such as identifying patterns, flagging contradictions, and synthesizing insights across dozens of interviews. So what’s the distinction that matters?</p><p>AI excels at <strong>pattern-based reasoning</strong>: recognizing correlations in data, clustering similar themes, and optimizing within defined parameters. Humans provide <strong>meaning-based judgment</strong>: interpreting what patterns signify about real needs, deciding which correlations reveal causation, and determining what’s worth pursuing given purpose and values.</p><p>The Discovery Judgment Framework helps teams systematically develop this capability. This article focuses on the framework’s first component: the 19 judgment points where meaning-based judgment — not just pattern recognition — determines whether teams build the right things.</p><h3>The Discovery Judgment Framework</h3><p>If you’re skeptical about “yet another framework,” that skepticism is earned. You’ve probably worked with Lean, Agile, Design Thinking, Jobs-to-Be-Done, OKRs, and dozens of others. Each contributes value — improving alignment, efficiency, and collaboration. But even the best frameworks cannot substitute for the quality of judgment applied within them. Framework fatigue typically occurs when teams adopt them without developing the judgment to use them effectively.</p><p>The <strong>Discovery Judgment Framework</strong> is different. It makes invisible judgment visible and systematically developable through four integrated components:</p><ol><li><strong>Judgment Points (Diagnostic)</strong>: Where judgment matters across the discovery-delivery-learning cycle.</li><li><strong>Quality Dimensions (Measurement)</strong>: How to assess judgment quality.</li><li><strong>Core Practices (Development)</strong>: How to strengthen judgment systematically.</li><li><strong>Maturity Model (Progression)</strong>: How judgment capability evolves.</li></ol><p>This doesn’t replace your existing discovery frameworks; it makes them more effective by revealing the quality of judgment they apply.</p><h3>Why These Judgment Points Matter Now</h3><p>As AI makes execution radically faster and cheaper, teams can now build the wrong things at unprecedented speed. What once took six months of misguided effort now takes six weeks, or with AI, six days.</p><p>As Teixeira and Braga (2025) warn in UX Collective’s State of UX in 2025 report, we’re witnessing “a fundamental shift in responsibilities and a transfer of design control from designers to a complex network of algorithms, automated tools, and business stakeholders.” The troubling trend? Teams are “slowly swapping user research for automated A/B tests, and gradually letting the data make decisions on our behalf.” This abdication of human judgment is precisely the problem.</p><p>Judgment density increases as AI accelerates delivery — the number of consequential decisions teams face per week skyrockets. Improving judgment quality isn’t optional; it’s the only scalable control mechanism for preventing algorithms from deciding what to build.</p><p>Teams committed to better discovery still struggle with a fundamental question: Where exactly do you apply judgment? Which decisions actually determine success or failure?</p><p>AI can now synthesize interviews in minutes, but only humans provide the judgment to interpret what patterns signify and decide what’s worth pursuing. Each judgment point is a moment where AI can either accelerate good judgment or amplify bad judgment. When humans interpret AI-generated insights, bias creeps in — we tend to confirm what we already believe and selectively interpret patterns.</p><p>Consider a typical moment where AI accelerates pattern recognition — but judgment still decides what matters.</p><p>A team building project management software conducts eighteen customer interviews. AI analysis flags that thirteen participants mentioned “estimates are always wrong.”</p><p>The team noticed what AI couldn’t: nine engineering managers were frustrated that their teams underestimated technical complexity, while four product managers were frustrated that stakeholders underestimated scope. Same symptom, opposing causes — one group needs better bottom-up estimation tools, the other needs better top-down scope definition.</p><p>Their decision: Interview three people from each group separately to understand the distinct jobs before proposing any solution.</p><p>AI accelerated pattern recognition from days to minutes. Only humans can judge that identical complaints mask fundamentally different problems that require separate discovery paths. As Gecis (2021) emphasizes in the Jobs-to-Be-Done framework, understanding the underlying “job” customers are trying to accomplish — not just surface-level feature requests — is essential for meaningful product decisions.</p><h3>The 19 Critical Judgment Points</h3><p>I’ve mapped the moments where discovery judgment determines outcomes. These judgment points will continue to evolve as practice deepens. Understanding them gives teams a way to see their reasoning, not just results. Discovery isn’t one decision — it’s a cascade of 19 interconnected judgment calls organized into four domains:</p><p><strong>Framing Judgment</strong>: defining the right problems to solve. Focuses on <em>what</em> and <em>why</em>: identifying customers, uncovering unmet needs, clarifying desired outcomes, mapping assumptions, and aligning on the opportunity worth pursuing.</p><p><strong>Solution Judgment</strong>: exploring and choosing how to solve them. Centers on <em>how</em> to generate and evaluate alternative approaches, balancing feasibility and value, sequencing risks, and deciding what to test first.</p><p><strong>Validation Judgment</strong>: interpreting evidence and learning from experiments. Addresses <em>what’s true</em>: setting confidence thresholds, interpreting results objectively, and deciding when to pivot, persist, or stop.</p><p><strong>Post-Delivery Judgment</strong>: learning from what happens after launch. Closes the loop: selecting which signals to track, recognizing emerging patterns, interpreting success or failure, and feeding insights back into discovery cycles.</p><figure><img alt=""A visual diagram showing 19 critical judgment points organized into four domains: Framing Judgment (purple), Solution Judgment (blue), Validation Judgment (green), and Post-Delivery Judgment (orange). Arrows show how judgment cycles continuously from discovery through delivery and back through post-delivery learning. Each domain contains 4–5 specific judgment points where human reasoning has the most significant influence on product outcomes."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*QXnk5BOUTqwAxF49Yowvjw.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>This diagnostic map illustrates where human reasoning has the most significant influence on product outcomes across four domains: Framing, Solution, Validation, and Post-Delivery. The arrows illustrate how judgment cycles: decisions feed forward through discovery and delivery, and loop back through post-delivery learning.</p><p>Teams don’t always apply all 19 judgment points in practice, but being aware of each one is essential — what’s unseen can’t be improved.</p><p>Here’s how this plays out in real product work.</p><h3>Two Example Judgment Points in Action</h3><p><strong>Scenario</strong>: A cross-functional product team is developing a Team Handoff Tracker — a tool designed to mitigate the chaos that occurs when work “falls between teams.” They’ve heard complaints about tasks “disappearing into a black hole” and assume the main problem is a lack of visibility across departments.</p><h4>1. Assumption Identification &amp; Risk Assessment</h4><p><strong>The judgment</strong>: What assumptions are you making, and which are riskiest?</p><p><strong>Poor approach</strong>: Treat “visibility” as an obvious need. Jump to dashboards and progress indicators without testing whether users actually value visibility.</p><p><strong>Strong approach</strong>: List assumptions explicitly: “Users lack visibility into task ownership,” “A dashboard will solve that,” “Teams will update it regularly.” Test the riskiest first. Result: Users don’t want more visibility — they want more transparent accountability.</p><p>As Krawczyk (2022) notes in his article on identifying product assumptions, teams are susceptible to confirmation bias (the longer it takes to test an assumption, the more we want it to be true) and commitment bias (the more effort we invest, the harder it is to pivot). Making assumptions explicit and testing the riskiest ones first protects against these biases.</p><h4>2. Evidence Interpretation</h4><p><strong>The scenario continues</strong>: Three months later, early pilot feedback appears promising. Users rate the tool “very helpful” and mention “clarity.”</p><p><strong>The judgment</strong>: What does this feedback actually mean?</p><p><strong>Poor approach</strong>: Interpret positive feedback as validation of the visibility hypothesis. Plan feature expansions. Miss that “clarity” meant something different — users valued knowing who to contact, not seeing every task’s status.</p><p><strong>Strong approach</strong>: Review qualitative comments line by line. Ask: “When you say ‘clarity,’ what kind?” Discover that the real need is accountability, not visibility. Pivot to emphasize ownership cues and handoff confirmations.</p><p><strong>Lesson</strong>: If those two judgment points seem small, consider what happens when even one goes wrong.</p><h3>How Judgment Errors Compound</h3><p>These judgment points don’t exist in isolation — they ripple across the system like dominoes.</p><p>A SaaS company interviews only enterprise clients, despite SMBs accounting for 70% of its revenue. This Customer Selection error cascades through Problem Framing, Solution Judgment, Feature Prioritization, and Evidence Interpretation — accumulating $315K over 10 months. The real need could have been validated in three weeks for under $10K.</p><figure><img alt=""A flowchart showing how a single poor judgment decision cascades through multiple stages. Starting with “Customer Selection” error (interviewing only enterprise clients), the diagram shows dominoes falling through Problem Framing, Solution Judgment, Feature Prioritization, and Evidence Interpretation. Each stage shows increasing cost and time investment, ending with $315K spent over 10 months to solve the wrong problem when the real solution could have been validated in 3 weeks for under $10K."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*bJm6WJGE0uzRp6pehjP3GQ.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>Now consider AI’s impact: With AI-powered development, that same cascade might occur in five months instead of 10 months — you fail twice as fast, yet at the same total cost. AI doesn’t make bad judgment cheaper or less damaging — it just accelerates how quickly those judgment errors compound.</p><p>The same cascade works in your favour when early judgment is sound. A clear problem definition shortens solution cycles, tightens validation loops, and compounds learning.</p><p>This is why cross-functional judgment matters — different perspectives catch different errors. Diverse perspectives help teams identify flaws in assumptions and uncover alternative interpretations. A user researcher identifies Evidence Interpretation issues. An engineer identifies Technical Approach problems. A designer notices Problem Framing gaps. A customer success rep recognizes Opportunity Selection misalignment. Each perspective is a checkpoint against cascading failure.</p><p>(In smaller teams, these roles may overlap or not exist as separate positions — one person might play multiple roles. What matters isn’t the org chart, but ensuring these different perspectives inform decisions. The 19 judgment points remain critical regardless of team size or structure.)</p><h3>Discovery as Continuous Practice</h3><p>Most teams treat discovery as a phase; the best treat it as a habit. Discovery doesn’t stop at launch. It’s continuous: discover → deliver → learn → discover again.</p><p>After shipping, teams face a flood of signals. The challenge isn’t finding feedback — it’s making sense of it. Each post-delivery judgment point informs the next discovery cycle: Signal Selection shapes Customer Selection, Pattern Recognition refines Problem Framing, and Learning Extraction improves Evidence Interpretation.</p><p>As Beyer (2025) demonstrates in his guide to Teresa Torres’ Opportunity Solution Trees framework, continuous discovery requires ongoing customer touchpoints and systematic experimentation. Teams that treat discovery as continuous develop judgment faster. Every cycle sharpens judgment for the next cycle’s 19 judgment points. Over time, teams that make these decision points visible move from individual judgment to shared judgment — a collective sensemaking muscle that compounds learning.</p><h3>Assessing Your Team’s Judgment</h3><p>Use this quick self-assessment to identify where your team’s judgment most often falls short.</p><p>Many teams skip several judgment decisions, letting process and habit decide by default. This assessment makes them visible.</p><h4>Framing Judgment</h4><ul><li>Do we validate the problem before building solutions?</li><li>Can we articulate the job our customers are trying to do?</li><li>Have we explicitly mapped assumptions?</li><li>Do we know which customer segments we’re serving and why?</li></ul><h4>Solution Judgment</h4><ul><li>Do we test the riskiest assumptions first?</li><li>Can we explain why we rejected alternatives?</li><li>Do we prioritize based on risk and learning?</li><li>Have we generated multiple solution approaches before committing to one?</li></ul><h4>Validation Judgment</h4><ul><li>Do we interpret evidence objectively?</li><li>Do we have explicit confidence thresholds?</li><li>When we pivot, can we articulate what evidence prompted the change?</li><li>Do we distinguish between what users say and what they mean?</li></ul><h4>Post-Delivery Judgment</h4><ul><li>Do we track the right signals after launch?</li><li>Do we extract learning systematically from outcomes?</li><li>How quickly do we incorporate post-launch insights into the discovery process?</li><li>Can we explain what success or failure taught us about our reasoning?</li></ul><p>Many teams find they’re stronger in some domains than others, and that balance shifts over time. The goal isn’t perfection — it’s visibility and deliberate improvement.</p><p>Focus on the domain that most needs strengthening. For <strong>Framing judgment</strong>: understand the underlying progress customers seek, not just what they say. For <strong>Solution judgment</strong>: generate three distinct approaches before committing. For <strong>Validation judgment</strong>: make confidence thresholds explicit and, as Nousis (2019) demonstrates, systematically test your biggest unknowns. For <strong>Post-Delivery judgment</strong>: track the right signals, extract insights, and feed them back into the discovery process.</p><p>Knowing which parts of your judgment need strengthening is the first step toward improvement — and self-awareness is where progress begins.</p><h3>Your Next Move</h3><p>You now have a diagnostic tool. You can:</p><ul><li>See where your team’s judgment is strong versus where it needs strengthening</li><li>Identify which judgment points you’re skipping entirely</li><li>Trace which judgment points have caused your biggest failures</li><li>Map how poor decisions early cascade later</li></ul><p>Here’s your three-step action plan:</p><ol><li><strong>Review the 19 judgment points with your team.</strong> Identify which points you’re skipping and which have caused your biggest failures.</li><li><strong>Pinpoint the three judgment points that most need strengthening.</strong> Use the assessment questions to diagnose where judgment breaks down most often.</li><li><strong>Choose ONE judgment point to address in your next sprint.</strong> Don’t try to fix everything.

How can we cut through the static to see the real picture?</p><p>Enter academia.</p><p>Over the past five years, numerous academic journal papers have been published about AI and UX design. While the wheels of academia turn slowly, we get a significant trade-off for its glacial pace: objectivity and methodical rigour.</p><p>In other words: a healthy dose of perspective.</p><p>The goal of this article is to summarise academic findings relating to four questions:</p><ol><li>Where is AI being used in the UX design process?</li><li>What are the advantages and drawbacks of using AI in UX design?</li><li>How do UX design practitioners feel about using AI?</li><li>What are the takeaways for future use of AI in UX design?</li></ol><p>The key sources for this article are two <a href=""https://library.leeds.ac.uk/info/1404/literature-searching/15/systematic-reviews"">systematic reviews</a> from 2025: one <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/ahci/3869207"">published in <em>Advances of Human-Computer Interaction</em></a>, and another <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04469"">available on the open-access scholarly platform ArXiv</a>.

Where AI is used in the design process</h3><p>The highest usage of AI in UX design is in the <strong>testing</strong> phase, suggests <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/ahci/3869207"">one of our 2025 systematic reviews</a>. According to this paper, 58% of studied AI usage in UX is in either the testing or discovery stage. This maybe shouldn’t be surprising, considering generative AI for visual ideation and UI prototyping has lagged behind text generation.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram showing number of studies looking at AI usage in UX design"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*68bsGgzn3STeRh1mRsJtEA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>AI usage in the UX design process (Luo, 2025)</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s what AI’s commonly being used for in each design stage:</p><h4>Discovery</h4><ul><li>Identifying design problems</li><li>Understanding user needs and behaviours</li><li>Creating user personas</li></ul><h4>Ideation</h4><ul><li>Co-creating solution concepts</li><li>Exploring design alternatives</li><li>Predicting product values</li></ul><h4>Prototyping</h4><ul><li>Generating UI designs</li><li>Converting sketches to prototypes</li><li>Checking for GUI guideline violations</li></ul><h4>Testing</h4><ul><li>Predicting user experience</li><li>Identifying usability issues (e.g. heuristic evaluations)</li><li>Planning and analysing user testing</li></ul><p>In terms of what AI tools UX practitioners are using, here’s a breakdown which is both informative but already slightly out of date:</p><figure><img alt=""Graph showing AI usage in UX design with ChatGPT leading the way"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*prI1D36s13QeOnnQG-taug.png"" /><figcaption>Frequency of AI models used across UI/UX design studies (Ahmed and Imran, 2025)</figcaption></figure><h4>Summary</h4><p>UX practitioners are clearly making use of AI across the design process, with ChatGPT being the most popular tool.</p><p>However, while ideation and prototyping with AI gains a lot of attention, it’s the <em>testing</em> phase where the most studies have examined utilising AI — and it’s also significantly studied in the discovery phase. This disparity may even out as AI continues to improve at generating UI designs.</p><h3>2. Advantages and drawbacks of using AI in UX design</h3><p>I’ve grouped these insights from academic papers into broad themes. You can see that for every benefit of using AI in the UX design process, there are risks and pitfalls to avoid.</p><h4>Speed, cost and quality</h4><p><strong>Advantages: </strong>AI can speed up UX design in numerous ways, from research and ideation to prototyping and testing. For example, it can <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3658619.3658628"">accelerate concept iteration</a> in the early stages of the design process compared to traditional UX methods. This has obvious implications in terms of <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10115412"">reducing delivery timeframes and project costs</a>.</p><figure><img alt=""Seahorse design concept generated by the AI tool Midjourney"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AJ0q0Q62hV8bx5KL984ECQ.png"" /><figcaption>Concept co-creation with Midjourney (Maceli, Smith and Bhakta, 2024)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Drawbacks:</strong> AI generated design ideas can be <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642114"">homogeneous, generic and lacking in consistency</a>, meaning the time and cost of human input must be considered to ensure the final designs are sufficiently distinct and cohesive. (That is, if we care about designing better — or simply good — solutions, and not just <em>faster </em>solutions.)</p><h4>Efficiency versus innovation</h4><p><strong>Advantages: </strong>The use of AI can <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642114"">relieve UX designers from mundane and tedious tasks</a>, allowing them to concentrate on activities that require more critical thinking and emotional engagement. Essentially, there are huge opportunities to offload a lot of grunt work to AI systems. But designers need to be careful about this, because…</p><p><strong>Drawbacks: </strong>Over-reliance on AI designs could lead to <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3409120.3410638"">fixation on minor optimisations rather than out-of-the-box thinking</a>. This means designers need to find a balance between efficiency and innovation — by avoiding dependence on AI where human creativity and agency would add value leading to better solutions.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram showing what AI can and cannot do in the design process"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kAEQ1IPqJKQJX2eDBMU65g.png"" /><figcaption>What AI can and can’t do (Li et al., 2024)</figcaption></figure><h4>Skills and development</h4><p><strong>Advantages: </strong>There’s clear <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3404983.3405506"">potential for AI to lower the skill threshold required for designers</a> in UX. Which makes sense, as prompting is easier to learn than all the features and functionality of Figma. This change allows a wider range of people to contribute design ideas without traditional visual design tool skills.</p><figure><img alt=""Series of sketched, designed and generated UI screens"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1007/1*lKKQRvtXf8KGR-nH2anUPQ.png"" /><figcaption>Sketched input versus manual design and generated AI output (Buschek, Anlauff and Lachner, 2020)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Drawbacks: </strong>Over-dependence on generative AI tools might impede development for UX novices, as <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3615335.3623035"">repetitive tasks help cultivate UX design skills and judgement</a>. Junior designers might be at higher risk of negative cognitive effects from AI generally, as <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/15/1/6"">young people exhibit higher dependence on AI tools and lower critical thinking skills</a>.</p><h4>Summary</h4><p>It’s a mixed bag, basically. For all the opportunities that AI brings to UX design, there are plenty of challenges and traps practitioners can fall into. Some of these issues will be solved by technology improving, but others require skilful and mindful integration of AI into UX design processes.</p><figure><img alt=""Bar chart showing challenges using AI in UX design with hallucinations at the top"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kmOGmOvjO0jbcZVAOwLvGQ.png"" /><figcaption>AI challenges in UX design (Ahmed and Imran, 2025)</figcaption></figure><h3>3. How UX practitioners feel about using AI</h3><p>These are reflections from UX professionals about their experiences of using AI in the design process. I’ve categorised them as either positive or negative sentiments, adding a few comments of my own (in parentheses).</p><h4>Positives</h4><ul><li>Using AI in the design process can make <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/ahci/3869207"">UX practitioners feel both more effective and efficient</a>. (I hesitate to use the phrase ‘super-powered’, as The Incredibles tells us: when everyone’s super, no-one is.)</li><li>Designing with AI helps develop skills in prompting, which is <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04469"">emerging as a core design skill</a>. (It’s surely only a matter of time before we start seeing <em>Prompting is Designing</em> UX books hitting the shelves.)</li><li>Generating design variants with <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3643834.3661624"">AI avoids the ‘blank page’ problem</a>, where UX designers struggle to get started. (Even for professionals, the blank canvas of a design file can sometimes be intimidating.)</li><li>Collaboration with AI can<em> </em>feel like a <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/ahci/3869207"">complementary partnership between human cognition and AI technology</a>. (Similar to a senior designer guiding a junior designer.)</li><li>Using <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3643834.3660703"">AI helps facilitate collaboration with stakeholders</a> by streamlining idea sharing and exploration. (Basically, AI can help make the sometimes arcane practice of UX clearer and more accessible to stakeholders.)</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Four photos from a design focus group on AI, showing people with colourful sticky notes"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1012/1*zmWAQEFMce3Ca1vsl6AkyQ.png"" /><figcaption>Focus group on AI and UX collaboration (Wang et al., 2024)</figcaption></figure><h4>Negatives</h4><ul><li>Designing with AI can also feel like being a <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2024.1404647/full"">client commissioning a contractor rather than <em>designing</em></a>. (In other words: designers can feel like the AI is doing the fun, creative bits while they write the brief.)</li><li>When UX designers feel like they’ve outsourced creative tasks, it can lead to <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3491101.3503564"">diminished sense of ownership over the results</a>. (How invested can you be if you didn’t even draw a single rectangle?)</li><li>Creating an effective prompt can be a <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04469"">time-intensive process with a high cognitive burden</a>. (Although in future this could be mitigated by refining prompting templates and support resources.)</li></ul><h4>Summary</h4><p>The positives outweigh the negatives, but there are clear issues to resolve. This includes UX practitioners’ sense of identity as designers, as well as the time and mental effort required to craft effective prompts, generate outputs and carry out continual refinements.</p><h3>4. Takeaways for future use of AI in UX design</h3><p>I’ve tried to categorise these suggestions into meaningful themes. They typically crop up in the discussion and conclusion sections of academic papers.</p><h4>AI increases efficiency, but people still matter</h4><p>The biggest impact of AI in UX design is the <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/ahci/3869207"">increased efficiency across the design process</a>. However, AI cannot replace human interpersonal communication, collaboration, creativity or originality; therefore it’s important to <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642114"">balance pursuing efficiency while preserving the human-centred nature of UX design</a>.</p><h4>Humans need to remain in the loop</h4><p>UX designers should adopt a <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/discover/human-in-the-loop"">human-in-the-loop</a> approach to validate AI output, improve model performance and <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10034833"">avoid overreliance on automated systems</a>. However, designers should be mindful that <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3512943"">AI tools could potentially <em>reinforce</em> their existing biases</a> instead of challenging them. This is an area where critical thinking skills are absolutely, well, critical.</p><figure><img alt=""Word cloud with prompt engineering, real-time feedback and modular design featuring prominently"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/980/1*RurZhxCwxTpuUlk--9Yg1w.png"" /><figcaption>Word cloud of best practices for AI and UI/UX design (Ahmed and Imran, 2025)</figcaption></figure><h4>AI policies are needed for ethical practice</h4><p>Adoption of AI <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04469"">must be ethical and inclusive as well as efficient</a>. To alleviate concerns about ethics, data privacy, ownership, and accountability, organisations should <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3643834.3660720"">set up and communicate policies on AI usage</a>. Too many UX practitioners are still driving ahead, often alone, without clear internal strategies or policies for generative AI.</p><h4>UX designers need specific AI training</h4><p>To successfully integrate AI into design team processes and workflows, UX practitioners would <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10382802"">benefit from training to develop proficiency</a> in crafting and refining prompts, assessing and criticising AI-generated output, and accounting for AI intricacies and limitations. There’s a world of difference between dabbling with AI in design and using it as effectively as possible.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>So what’s the story? How <em>is</em> AI impacting UX design?</p><p>Well, it’s clear from the academic studies that traditional design methods are being innovated: UX practitioners are harnessing AI, leading to efficiencies and lowering costs for organisations in the process. The benefits are undeniable. UX design has fundamentally changed in the past 2–3 years, and it’s probably career suicide to deny that.</p><p>In fact, more UX designers might need to let go of conventional design stages and activities to <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/ahci/3869207"">allow for even <em>more</em> innovative processes empowered by AI</a>. For example, strictly adhering to established workflows and handover processes ignores the potential to go from concept to functional, testable solution rapidly with AI.</p><p>However, there are potential drawbacks if AI usage in UX design is over-relied on, and used mindlessly. Without sufficient critical thinking, we can easily end up with generic, biased designs that don’t actually solve user problems. In some cases, we might even spend too much time on prompting and vibing with AI when we could have simply sketched or prototyped something ourselves — creating more sense of ownership in the process.</p><p>Many of these findings might feel obvious to a lot of people. But of course the point of rigorous research is often to validate what you <em>think </em>you already know. This deep dive into academia shows us what we really <em>do </em>know, for sure.

<h4>Is design standing in the way of me showing up in community?</h4><figure><img alt=""A screenshot from TheNapMinistry Threads that says ““Hey, here to say you don’t have to start a project, club, new invention or initiative as we focus on community, connection and the analog world. You can just hang out with your friends, say hello to your neighbor and spend more time offline.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*C7FlVluvY4cAD69gy3ui3g.jpeg"" /><figcaption>A screenshot from <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPkNek0ke20/?hl=en"">https://www.instagram.com/p/DPkNek0ke20/?hl=en</a></figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPkNek0ke20/?hl=en"">I recently saw a post</a> from The Nap Ministry that said:</p><blockquote><em>“Hey, here to say you don’t have to start a project, club, new invention or initiative as we focus on community, connection and the analog world. You can just hang out with your friends, say hello to your neighbor and spend more time offline.”</em></blockquote><p>The post struck a chord in me. I’m often the first to create a themed party or a logo for an event. I love a well-designed gathering with intentional activities and plans. But reading the post, it also made me think about all the times where I got stuck in the planning phase and never got to actually “doing” the thing I was planning in detail because I ran out of time or energy.</p><p>As much as curated spaces, planned interactions, crafted products, and intentional takeaways can enhance experiences and deepen connection, could too much design also stand in the way of us building and engaging in real communities?</p><p>What really happens when we overly design our communities?</p><h3>When we overly design, planning halts action.</h3><p>Planning the perfect event or building the perfect structure can feel productive, but it often becomes a stall. We wait until the idea is polished, until the branding feels right, until the schedule lines up, until we can justify gathering people around something that looks “enough.”</p><p>We often say that design is about iteration, but in practice, the planning and polishing can take over. The more we perfect something, the further we drift from the natural rhythms that actually allow community to form. Real connection needs space to unfold in ways we can’t predict. We don’t know what will happen — and that’s the point.</p><p>Community doesn’t usually grow from perfection. It grows from proximity. It grows from repetition. It grows from the very ordinary act of being around each other without needing a grand reason.</p><p>Sometimes a simple “want to grab a coffee?” is more powerful than a six-part series with a mission statement. Sometimes sitting on the couch while someone cooks dinner does more than any beautifully crafted activation. Sometimes an unplanned walk with a neighbor teaches us more about connection than a structured meetup ever could.</p><p>Starting small keeps the door open. It lowers the stakes. It reminds us that community isn’t something we architect; it’s something we practice. And the more we practice, the easier it becomes to move from idea to action without needing the perfect design as permission.</p><p>If we want more community, the answer is often simple: start where we are, with what we have, and with whoever is already nearby.</p><h3>When we overly design, ordinary engagements can become exclusive clubs.</h3><p>There’s a difference between creating supportive structure and shaping something so tightly that only certain people feel welcome. Over-designing can quietly turn everyday engagements into exclusive clubs, even when the intention is inclusivity.</p><p>I recently read the article <a href=""https://www.notion.so/Designing-or-not-for-community-289649f8ce0b80ff94ede7742537e55e?pvs=21""><em>We’ve Squeezed the “Life” Out of Civic Life</em></a> by Sam Pressler for Connective Tissue, which explores how professionalism can stand in the way of true civic life. He writes:</p><p><em>“When we create ‘spaces’ or build ‘fields’ — as we’ve done throughout the social sector — we end up professionalizing and specializing sets of activities. And when we professionalize and specialize these activities, we signal that these activities are only for some people and not for everyone else. Professionalization and credentialization can help increase the ‘quality’ of practice within a field, but this is done by intentionally erecting barriers to that practice. These barriers show up through the training and credentialing activities themselves, and through the creation of insider cultures, languages, and networks.”</em></p><p>Pressler describes this as “professionalized management,” but it’s also another way of thinking about overly designed community spaces. We build structures to optimize and make things efficient, but when it comes to relationships, those same structures can quietly become obstacles for the dedicated people who were showing up and putting in time from the start.</p><p>He continues:</p><p><em>“The creeping professionalization of civic life has shifted the everyday democracy responsibilities of community membership and participation to the domain of nonprofit management. As credentialed managers assume the roles once held by ordinary citizens and neighbors, formal programs take the place of informal groups and activities, and participation and membership become experiences that are channeled and controlled rather than seen as holistic ways of being.”</em></p><p>When we professionalize or overly design the spaces meant to bring us together, we risk losing the informal, everyday participation that community depends on. Work shifts from ordinary neighbors to credentialed managers. We move from organic connection to structured programs and in the midst of it all, we loose sight on the natural rhythms of relationships. To keep engagement open and alive, we have to leave room for the unpolished, the unplanned, and the people who show up simply because they care.</p><h3>When we overly design, we limit surprise and magic.</h3><p>Many social clubs now have robust brands and curated activities that look more like shopping experiences than the social gatherings we used to know. In the article <a href=""https://grouphug.substack.com/p/what-we-lose-when-optimizing-community""><em>What We Lose When Optimizing Community</em></a>, community builder Elise Granata explores what we lose when we “Shopify” our social lives.</p><p>Run clubs, social retreats, and book clubs use polished online presences to attract members and entice participation. These experiences are meant to support us in the loneliness epidemic, but Granata highlights how their branded, tightly designed nature can create a barrier. We start to feel like we need to know exactly what we’ll get out of something before we go. We scan social accounts and websites to decide if it’s for us. The element of surprise disappears, and we show up expecting an outcome — or as Granata says, <em>“We lose the feeling that comes with a little mystery and a healthy amount of risk.”</em></p><blockquote><em>“When we don’t know exactly what’s going to happen, you know what happens? We get to be surprised.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>— Elise Granata</em></blockquote><p>This focus on expectation can get in the way of simply being with what is and letting curiosity and surprise guide our next moves.</p><p><a href=""https://www.priyaparker.com/the-new-rules-of-gathering"">Priya Parker</a> says every gathering needs a purpose. While I agree in some ways, there’s also a magic in the unplanned spaces that emerge from the natural <strong>rhythms of relationships.</strong> Reading a book while a friend watches reels. Crafting while someone is cooking. “Time together” might be the purpose, but does it really have to be predetermined?</p><p>Sometimes the purpose only emerges after the event has already happened. The people who show up create the purpose together rather than blend into a pre-determined one. Pre-determined purposes can end up placing expectations on what something is and isn’t.</p><h3>Finding the balance</h3><p>One of my guiding practices in design these days is to not only ask <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/from-how-might-we-to-at-what-cost-b635a595afd2""><em>how might we</em> but also <em>at what cost</em>.</a> This helps mitigate unintended consequences. Sometimes the thing we want to design for becomes the very thing we design against if we’re not careful.</p><p>Community, relationships, and connection are messy, unpredictable, and unpolished — and that’s where the magic happens. If we want real connection, we have to leave space for magic to unfold as we just hang out with our friends, say hello to our neighbors, or spend more time offline.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=2b5abca0046a"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/designing-or-not-for-community-2b5abca0046a"">Designing (or not) for community</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

A whole different ecosystem nobody prepares you for.</p><p>This first week taught me far more than I expected. No hype, no “SaaS in 10 minutes” screenshots, just the parts that genuinely helped me move, build, and understand how the tool actually is set up and behaves.</p><p>Here’s the beginner’s map I wish I had on day one:</p><h3>1. Your first prompt quietly decides your fate</h3><p>Your first prompt matters more than people think. It sets the tone for the entire build. Write it like a mini blueprint:</p><figure><img alt=""promting"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zQFhLxBP7bxN0HOmh_oQOQ.gif"" /></figure><p><strong>What I’m building =</strong> project overview<br /><strong>Who it’s for =</strong> target users<br /><strong>Main pages</strong> <strong>=</strong> app structure + future flow<br /><strong>Key feature</strong>s <strong>=</strong> core functionality + what’s coming later (login, payment…)<br /><strong>Design vibe =</strong> visual direction<br /><strong>What not to do = </strong>guardrails + exclusions<br /><strong>Ask for help = </strong>Tell Lovable to review the prompt and ask questions before building.</p><p>Fill this out with your vision and plan, then ask another LLM, like ChatGPT, to improve it for Lovable use.</p><p>📌 <strong>Extra Tip:</strong> If the first result feels messy or off, <strong>don’t try to rescue it</strong>. Start fresh with a cleaner prompt. It saves time and sanity.</p><h3>2. The Custom Knowledge file is the project’s brain!</h3><p>It's a bit hidden inside your settings, but it's fantastic! You drop in the rules and context you want, and Lovable carries them through everything it builds. You don’t need long essays, just a few sharp lines. Anything you’re sick of repeating goes here, and Lovable remembers it for the whole project. It’s not code. It’s guidance.</p><figure><img alt=""custom knowledge"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pg15n6Oj9xe-LH51nzoLtw.png"" /></figure><h3>3.

Restore.<br />Edit old messages to explore a different path without trashing your current work. This is the closest Lovable gets to emotional support.</p><figure><img alt=""histiry"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0CO2mUOaGu2tAe8Nzabd3A.png"" /></figure><h3>5.

Security is surprisingly handled well</h3><p>This used to be my loudest anxiety.<br />Lovable runs a pre-publish health check: exposed keys, weird logic, risky pages… all flagged with explanations and fixes.</p><figure><img alt=""error"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qO9fwumn_NNSnuETcKATaA.png"" /></figure><p>You still need to care, but you don’t start from zero.<br />Dev friends: I’d love your take here, since security isn't my superpower and it matters. So please DO comment!</p><h3>7. Cloud without fear</h3><p>Lovable Cloud runs on Supabase, but you never touch Supabase directly.<br />No dashboards. No wiring. No random SQL from StackOverflow.</p><figure><img alt=""cloud"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uSmw-ispL_jxQN4iOvAJfw.png"" /></figure><p>You just say “Add login” and it sets up the database, auth, tables, storage, and security.<br />Non-tech builders finally unclench here.</p><h3>8. Use AI features with zero setup</h3><p>Summaries, chatbots, translations, sentiment checks, document Q&amp;A — already wired in. (You only pay extra for the LLM usage.)</p><figure><img alt=""integrated API"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Gnch_TKIeCYQuuGLRShD5A.png"" /><figcaption>Ready-to-use APIs in Lovable</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Stripe →</strong> Handles payments for your app.<br /> <strong>OpenAI →</strong> Adds AI features using OpenAI models.<br /> <strong>Anthropic →</strong> Adds AI features using Claude models.<br /> <strong>Resend →</strong> Sends emails through a modern email API.<br /> <strong>Clerk →</strong> Manages users, auth, and identities.<br /> <strong>Three.js →</strong> Builds interactive 3D graphics.<br /> <strong>D3.js →</strong> Creates data-driven visualisations.<br /> <strong>Highcharts →</strong> Produces polished charts and dashboards.<br /> <strong>p5.js →</strong> For creative coding and interactive visuals.<br /> <strong>Runware →</strong> Generates images from text.<br /> <strong>ElevenLabs →</strong> High-quality text-to-speech.<br /> <strong>Make →</strong> Visual tool for automating workflows.<br /> <strong>Replicate →</strong> Runs and fine-tunes open-source AI models.<br /> <strong>Stability AI →</strong> Open-model image generation and more.<br /> <strong>Twilio →</strong> Adds SMS and communication features.<br /> <strong>n8n →</strong> Visual workflow automation with integrations.</p><p><strong>And if Lovable doesn’t support an API yet, you can drop the docs into the chat, and it still hooks it up!</strong><br />As someone who used to fear API integrations… this felt like witchcraft.</p><h3>9. Learn prompting! It changes everything</h3><p>Use <strong>location + behaviour + guardrails</strong>.<br /> “On /settings, add X. It should do Y. Don’t touch Z.”</p><p>Break tasks into small pieces — max three at a time.</p><p>📌 <strong>Magic trick:</strong> add this to your main prompts: <br /><em>“Ask me anything you need to understand this prompt fully.”</em>Lovable slows down, asks questions, and builds what you <em>meant</em>, not what you accidentally wrote. SOOOOOO GOOD!</p><h3>10. Working on it!</h3><p>Any good list has 10 points, right? Well, this is a work in progress!</p><h3>My honest summary after week one</h3><p>A full rollercoaster.<br />At first, it feels like magic. Then you realise (like any real tool) you still need to understand how it thinks.<br />You still need docs ( I did that for you and summarised them in the course!)<br />You still need to level up your prompts.<br />You still need to shift from “instant SaaS” to “collaborating with a very fast robot.”</p><p>And that’s fine.</p><p>Lovable isn’t a replacement for thinking.<br />It’s a multiplier for anyone who typically gets locked out of the building.</p><blockquote>And if today’s version feels clunky… remember this:<br /><strong>In AI, today is the worst this tool will ever be.</strong><br />The curve is brutally fast. Don’t sleep on it!</blockquote><h3>Liked this?

<p>If I lost <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charlotte-tilbury-makeup-skincare-review"">my makeup bag</a> today, the first thing I’d replace would be <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/kosas-soulgazer-mascara-review"">my mascara</a>. Even a single slick makes me feel awake and ready to take on the day. It’s why my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/best-beauty-products-2024-innovator-awards"">R29 Beauty Innovator Awards roundup</a> always includes one. In 2024, it was the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fvoluminous-panorama-washable-mascara-pimprod2042577%3Fsku%3D2617241"">L’Oréal Paris Panorama Mascara</a>, and while I won’t reveal this year’s winner just yet, you can bet it’s even better. But my favorite skincare brand, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us"">The Ordinary</a>, might have just convinced me to quit mascara altogether thanks to its latest launch: the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Flash-curl-finisher-100732.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lash Curl Finisher</a>.</p>



<h2>What does The Ordinary’s Lash Curl Finisher do, and what are the benefits?</h2>



<p><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Flash-curl-finisher-100732.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary’s Lash Curl Finisher</a> is a clear, waterless gel designed to coat every lash, even the tiny ones in the corners, lifting and holding your curl for longer. If your lashes tend to fall flat after curling, think of this as invisible scaffolding. Not only does it help to keep your curl in place, but it also gives lashes a natural, glossy finish, like you’re wearing mascara — all without smudges or flakes.</p>



<p>A handful of clever ingredients make it all work. Without getting too technical, you’ll find non-irritating polymers — or film formers — like butylene, ethylene, and dimethicone copolymers, all approved for use around the eyes. They help the gel cling to lashes, provide all-day support for curls, and keep lashes flexible and comfortable, rather than brittle or caked in product. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948337.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>

<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948127.jpg?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Beyond the film formers, you’ll also spot ingredients that have become staples in your skincare routine. Squalane softens and conditions lash hairs and the surrounding skin, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-is-glycerin"">while glycerin</a> deeply moisturizes. Though the main effect is cosmetic, mimicking the effects of an expensive <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/korean-lash-lift-review"">lash lift</a> or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charlotte-tilbury-exaggereyes-mascara-review"">luxury mascara</a>, it also doubles as a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/12/11243440/keratin-lash-lift-tint-review"">lash treatment</a>.</p>



<h2>How do you use The Ordinary’s Lash Curl Finisher, and is it any good?</h2>



<p>I use the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Flash-curl-finisher-100732.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lash Curl Finisher</a> just like mascara. First, I curl my lashes with my trusty <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Feyelash-curler-P244437"">Shiseido Eyelash Curler</a> (an imperative step, according to The Ordinary), then I apply it in coats. But make no mistake: this isn’t like the clear mascaras of the ’00s that did nothing but make lashes feel rock hard. This actually makes them look thicker thanks to the lustrous sheen it leaves behind. It’s not quite a wet look, but it’s not invisible, either. If you touch your lashes, they feel slightly tacky before drying — and it’s this texture that keeps them upright, like your curled lashes are preserved (in a gentle way). </p>



<p>You might’ve seen the <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@jacquelinekilikita/video/7094220545536953606?lang"">Vaseline lash lift hack</a> on TikTok, where people use petroleum jelly instead of mascara for a no-makeup lash look. <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@jacquelinekilikita/video/7094220545536953606?lang"">I’ve tried it myself</a>, and it works well, but because Vaseline is so soft, it keeps lashes almost wet. The Ordinary’s Lash Curl Finisher, on the other hand, dries down, making it more transfer-proof than petroleum jelly.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948339.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948340.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>The curved brush also makes it easier to capture each lash, and I’m convinced that both the shape and thickness of the wand give my curls an extra boost, keeping them perky. Honestly, a couple of coats of this is infinitely better at thickening my lashes than a single coat of mascara. Of course, I have dark lashes, so I’m not exactly certain how it would perform on blondes or redheads, but the product does make them appear darker — like I’m wearing black mascara.</p>



<p>My lashes stay curled — with a very slight drop, as is natural — until I remove the product at the end of the day. I just use a cleansing balm, but micellar water or a foaming cleanser works just as well, since the product doesn’t need much effort to dissolve — nothing like the scrubbing mascara can require. </p>



<p>While The Ordinary doesn’t specifically recommend this use, I run the wand through my brows, too, and it works just as brilliantly as a brow gel, keeping my thick hairs perfectly in place.</p>

<p>I have a confession to make. And it’s the kind I can only say now, in my thirties, after <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/motherhood-experiences"">having a child</a> and after finding and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/latinas-redefining-marriage-traditions"">marrying</a> an incredible man: I love my husband. I love our life. And I love our daughter. But if we ever divorced, I would never get married again.</p>



<p>It’s not because marriage has failed me. Javy and I met during the middle of the pandemic (remember 2020?) on the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/latine-dating-apps-successful-stories-couples"">Latino dating app Chispa</a>, and we’ve been attached ever since. We dated for six months before moving in together, and we got married in Las Vegas in 2023, when I was already three months pregnant. He’s a great partner and father. He works two full-time jobs, and still teaches our daughter how to count in Spanish and helps out during bath time. It truly feels like I’ve found a diamond in the rough. </p>



<p>But five years later, I now understand what the real <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/this-is-the-surprising-cost-of-being-in-a-relationship"">cost of partnership</a> looks like and what marriage asks for. And if I ever had to rebuild my life from scratch, I simply would not hand all of that over to someone else again.</p>



<p>Marriage, even the good kind, demands things from women that it doesn’t equally demand from men. No, I don’t mean the often-physical labor of keeping a house or raising a family, though, according to the <a href=""https://thegepi.org/the-free-time-gender-gap/"">Gender Equity Policy Institute</a>, heterosexual women perform twice the amount of childcare and household work as their male counterparts<em>. </em>But for many women, that can be the tip of the invisible labor iceberg: How you plan your day with someone else’s schedule factored in and how you approach bills and major life decisions — it all changes with another autonomous person’s thoughts, hopes, and limitations thrown into the mix. <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/staying-sane-inside-insanity/202204/is-marriage-a-bad-deal-for-women?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">Psychology Today</a> revealed that women end marriages not only because of abuse or infidelity, but also because “the relationship is no longer worth the sacrifices required of them.” Turns out, the emotional labor, lack of empathy from partners, and unequal effort are just some of the reasons many women walk away.<em> </em></p>



<p>Historically, marriage has been an institution built on women’s sacrifice, emotionally, socially, and even legally. For generations, women have swallowed our needs, softened our ambitions, and built our identities around care: care for our partners, our home, our children, and everyone else before us. And for Latinas, in particular, who were often raised in cultures where love is shown through service, where “familia primero”<em> </em>isn’t a suggestion but a moral code, it’s frighteningly easy to slip into roles our mothers and grandmothers carried, even when we swore we never would. And it’s not because we’re weak but rather because the world still subconsciously expects it, praises it, and labels anything less as selfish.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Historically, marriage has been an institution built on women’s sacrifice, emotionally, socially, and even legally.”</p><cite>Paulina Roe</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>I went into marriage thinking I understood partnership, but once the cake was eaten and the honeymoon was over, I realized how much of my life had become work to keep <em>our lives</em> functioning. The calendar-keeping, the appointments, the remembering, the meal-planning, and the million invisible decisions that keep a household running — it all fell on me by default. I carried it convincing myself it was normal and every partnership goes through this. And part of that came from my culture. I married a loving, devoted Latino man who was raised in a world where men are applauded for “helping.” And I’m a Latina raised with the same script: be strong, but also be accommodating. Build a life, but also carry everyone else’s.</p>



<p>This isn’t how things are for us anymore. Eventually, we talked it over and agreed that we’re not continuing that cycle. Not in our marriage and not for our daughter. And slowly, things shifted. Not perfectly, but intentionally. Today, he carries his share of both the parenting and day-to-day responsibilities.</p>



<p>“Marriage isn’t always 50/50,” <a href=""https://www.waytoknowthyself.com"">Stella Barrutia, LCSW,</a> a Licensed Clinical Social Worker based in Chicago, tells Refinery29 Somos. “Some days, it’s 80/20. Other days, it’s 20/80. When the foundation is truly love and respect, the balance will always realign. The challenge is that many women are taught, implicitly or explicitly, that once they’re married, they must continue doing everything for themselves — and now also for their husbands and children.”</p>



<p>Barrutia, whose work is bicultural and includes a focus on Latine experiences, added that “honest conversations about partnership, roles, ambitions, and expectations are absolutely essential” when it comes to choosing a life partner. In other words, the day-to-day setup of marriage and partnership can be imperfect while the relationship itself is deeply loving. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“For Latinas, in particular, who were often raised in cultures where love is shown through service, where “familia primero”isn’t a suggestion but a moral code, it’s frighteningly easy to slip into roles our mothers and grandmothers carried, even when we swore we never would.”</p><cite>Paulina Roe</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>My critique is of the structure, not with the man I chose. Javy is a great partner and a great father, and I’m so grateful for him. He fully supports my career and business, cares for our family to make sure we never go without, and shows up when life gets heavy. He brings steadiness into our lives. Just last week, after a 24-hour shift at the firehouse, he walked in, took our baby out of her crib when she woke up at 7 a.m., and fed her breakfast, did the whole routine, and let me sleep without ever making it seem like a favor.</p>



<p>But marriage as an institution? It’s complicated and, based on current trends, is becoming outdated.</p>



<p>Here’s the reality: Americans are <a href=""https://usafacts.org/articles/state-relationships-marriages-and-living-alone-us/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">getting married way less</a> and much later than previous generations. The marriage rate in the U.S. has dropped by more than 50% since the early 1900s, and only about 1 in 5 people in their mid-20s today has ever been married, the lowest level ever recorded. People of all genders aren’t rushing down the aisle anymore, and instead are taking their time, building careers, and figuring out who they are before they sign up for that kind of commitment.</p>



<p>And the myth that marriage is the only path to stability? Well, that’s gone, too. Latinas, and women in general, are now earning <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2024/05/15/how-latinas-educational-and-economic-situation-has-changed-in-the-last-two-decades/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">more college degrees</a> than men, and we’re showing up in spaces our mothers and abuelas could only dream about. Financial independence has shifted the power dynamic, too. And to add to that, women are delaying motherhood (I had my first baby at 31), choosing different family structures, and rejecting the idea that being a wife or a mother has to define your entire identity. </p>



<p>Many of us grew up watching our mothers carry the emotional load, the childcare, the cooking, everything — and now we’re refusing to recreate what drained the women before us.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Many women — and especially Latinas — grew up watching generations of women carry their marriages on their backs. So even when they’re ambitious, educated, and financially independent, there’s a learned fear that marriage will shrink them. They’re afraid that choosing partnership means choosing limitations. That’s not because women are unsure of themselves; it’s because the institution still carries expectations rooted in another era.”</p><cite>Stella Barrutia, LCSW</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“Many women — and especially Latinas — grew up watching generations of women carry their marriages on their backs,” Barrutia notes. “So even when they’re ambitious, educated, and financially independent, there’s a learned fear that marriage will shrink them. They’re afraid that choosing partnership means choosing limitations. That’s not because women are unsure of themselves; it’s because the institution still carries expectations rooted in another era.” </p>



<p>Barrutia continues: “When women ask, ‘Can I be ambitious and married?’ they’re really asking, ‘Is there room for all of me here? Healthy partnership answers that with a yes. But culturally, many haven’t seen that model reflected back to them.”</p>



<p>True, these ambitions can feel a little less isolating when you have a partner cheering you on. Javy supports my dreams in the ways that actually matter. When work gets intense, he picks up what I can’t. When I’m building <a href=""http://themamicollective.com"">The Mami Collective,</a> he steps in with childcare, dinner, and whatever else needs to be done. He asks how he can help before I say I’m overwhelmed. He celebrates my wins with me. He makes space for my goals. And, most importantly, he shares the invisible load so it’s not all on me. Because that’s partnership: not perfect, not 50/50, just two people choosing to show up for each other.</p>



<p>Yet, even still, it often feels like the contours of marriage are constrained by outdated and ever-present expectations. </p>



<p>When writer Chanté Joseph posed the question <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/article/is-having-a-boyfriend-embarrassing-now"">“Is Having a Boyfriend Embarrassing Now?” </a>for <em>Vogue</em> in October, I noticed something interesting in the Instagram comments and the surrounding discourse. By and large, respondents echoed the same sentiment: I love my partner, but sometimes I fantasize about the freedom I’d have if I didn’t have to factor someone else into every corner of my life. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“We miss the unshared version of ourselves — the woman who had her own schedule, her own thoughts, her own orbit. Wanting that again isn’t selfish. It’s a sign you’re still in touch with who you are. That’s the difference.”</p><cite>PAULINA ROE</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Not because we want our partners gone, but because we want ourselves back. We miss the unshared version of ourselves — the woman who had her own schedule, her own thoughts, her own orbit. Wanting that again isn’t selfish. It’s a sign you’re still in touch with who you are. That’s the difference.</p>



<p>So when I say I wouldn’t get married again, I’m not saying that I’m rushing to divorce my husband. In fact, when I told him I wouldn’t get married again, he didn’t spiral. He lifted his eyebrows and said, “Honestly? I get it.” We’ve talked about how marriage hits differently for women and how the mental load and expectations pile up even in the healthiest partnerships. He knows I love him; he also knows the institution asks more of me than it ever will of him. His reaction wasn’t defensive. It was honest, a little uncomfortable, and very, “Yeah, you’re not wrong.”</p>



<p>I’m not married because of fear, tradition, or cultural pressure. I’m in it because I choose to be. Because this specific partnership works for me. Because the love and respect are mutual and because my husband makes the sacrifices with me, not just for him.</p>



<p>But if the water were to rise and hell were to freeze over, I wouldn’t do it over again. Not the white dress, not the bridal shower, not the honeymoon. I’m not interested in further contributing to a narrative in which a Latina’s value is tied to having a partner. I’ve worked my butt off to build my life, career, and identity. I don’t need to rebuild it all over again.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“My marriage is one of the most beautiful parts of my life, but it also taught me exactly how much of myself it takes to build a partnership that works. If I ever had to rebuild again, I’d do it as me: Paulina Roe. Because that’s enough.”</p><cite>PAULINA ROE</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>This clarity can be powerful. It helps me show up intentionally in my marriage today — not because I fear divorce, but because I understand what marriage takes from the both of us. A good marriage takes honest conversations about the hard things, even when they’re uncomfortable. And it takes partners choosing effort and accountability on purpose, because the relationship deserves it.</p>



<p>My marriage is one of the most beautiful parts of my life, but it also taught me exactly how much of myself it takes to build a partnership that works. If I ever had to rebuild again, I’d do it as me: Paulina Roe. Because that’s enough. I’d want to keep the version of me that survived. The woman who rebuilt her identity not as a wife or mother, but as herself.</p>



<p>On <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8UrKksq/"">TikTok</a>, many women have expressed feeling similarly. “I love my husband, but marriage still asks more of me than it does of him,” Diana Lopez, a 34-year-old Mexican-American mother of two based in Chicago, said. “I don’t want out, I just want room to breathe, to grow, and to still be my own person. Wanting yourself back isn’t a threat to your relationship — it’s a sign you’re finally paying attention to what you need.”</p>



<p>And why is that? Because we’re finally being honest about the price of partnership, even when it’s good.</p>



<p>And we’re asking ourselves: If I ever had to pay that price again, would I?<br /><br /></p>

<p>Cosmic beings, how are you feeling after that epic <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-super-cold-moon-in-gemini-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">final full moon</a> of the year? You might still be processing all the mental breakthroughs, communication revelations, and identity shifts last week’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-super-cold-moon-in-gemini-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Gemini Full Moon</a> brought up. As we enter this week, the energy shifts dramatically. Starting Monday, the moon enters Leo, and suddenly we’re revved up and ready to go. This fiery lunar transit wants us confident, creative, and taking action on everything we just learned about ourselves. The Leo energy is basically the universe saying “okay, you had your revelations, now let’s DO something  about them,” which feels empowering after days of emotional and mental processing. </p>



<p>Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th at 7:23 A.M. EST, marking the final time this planet will be retrograde in Pisces in our lifetime. If everything’s felt foggy, confusing, or like you’re living in a rom-com where you can’t tell fantasy from reality for the past five months, Neptune retrograde is why. The planet of dreams and collective  consciousness has been reviewing lessons since July, forcing us to distinguish between what’s real and what’s wishful thinking in our lives. When Neptune shifts direct, that fog starts lifting.  </p>



<p>On a collective level, this final Neptune in Pisces chapter (since 2011!) means we’re  wrapping up a 14-year cycle of learning to balance spirituality with reality, creativity with practicality, and compassion with boundaries. We might finally stop being so easily brainwashed by media narratives, romanticizing red flags, or escaping into fantasy when reality gets hard. Stay hydrated this week (Neptune rules water and our bodies will feel the shift), get grounded through movement or time in nature, and  journal your dreams. The subconscious is downloading final wisdom before this cosmic chapter closes. </p>



<p>Adding to the forward momentum, Mercury enters Sagittarius on December 11th, joining the sun, Venus, and Mars already in this Fire sign for one powerful final week of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Sagittarius Season energy</a>. After Mercury’s long stay in Scorpio (thanks to the retrograde), this shift into Sag has our minds craving adventure over analysis. With four major planets in Sagittarius, this is the most positive, forward-moving energy we’ve felt in months, perfect for manifesting, saying yes to invitations, spending time outdoors, and having more fun.  </p>



<p>But here’s the shadow: with all this Sag fire, we can easily spread ourselves too thin, overcommit because everything sounds exciting, or lose focus jumping between seventeen different opportunities. Take advantage of the action-oriented vibes without burning yourself out trying to do absolutely everything at once. Be bold, be honest, be adventurous, but also be intentional about where you’re directing all that energy.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ </p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, your inner world is about to get a whole lot clearer, but first, are you ready for what’s coming? Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th in your spirituality and closure sector, and honestly, the fog in your subconscious is finally starting to lift after five months of retrograde confusion. This marks the last time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, which is significant because your inner world,  dreams, and spiritual practice have been under cosmic renovation since 2011. The direct motion brings clarity about which healing practices actually work versus which ones were just spiritual bypassing, and what closure you still need before Neptune enters <em>your </em>sign on January 26th for over a decade. Use these final weeks of Neptune  in Pisces to finish the inner work, release what’s been lurking in your subconscious, and solidify your spiritual foundation because once Neptune hits Aries, your entire identity is going to get the foggy, transformative, confusing-but-magical treatment. </p>



<p>This is also the final full week of Mars (your ruler!) in Sagittarius lighting up your expansion sector, plus Mercury enters Sag on December 11th, making your mind and actions aligned on adventure, learning, and growth. The fire energy is peak levels right now… you’re motivated, optimistic, and probably saying yes to everything that sounds  exciting. But here’s the cosmic tension: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars in Sagittarius</a> is squaring Neptune in  Pisces this week, creating friction between your desire for bold action and your need for spiritual rest. This square might manifest as wanting to book spontaneous trips  while also feeling called to meditate for hours, or pushing forward aggressively while your subconscious is screaming that you need to slow down and process. The lesson? You can be both adventurous and spiritually grounded, but only if you’re intentional about balancing the two. </p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, Neptune shifts direct in Pisces on December 10th and suddenly your  friendships are about to make a lot more sense. For five months, Neptune retrograde  had you questioning which communities were real versus which ones were just  comfortable illusions, and now direct motion brings clarity about who actually deserves  your energy. This is the final time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime,  marking the end of a 14-year cycle of learning to distinguish between genuine  connection and codependent loyalty in your social circles. You might suddenly feel ready to post again, curate your timeline without guilt, mute people who <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=peace+refinery29&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">drain your peace</a>, or simply have peaceful detachment from friendships that no longer align with who you’re becoming. With Uranus also wrapping its final tour in your sign, this double dose of clarity about community is helping you trust your discernment… if someone feels off, they probably are, and you don’t owe anyone access to your evolution just because they knew the old you. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, this is the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius activating your  transformation and shared resources sector, plus Mercury enters Sag on December 11th, making conversations about money, intimacy, and depth way more direct. Things might have felt tumultuous around wealth-building and joint finances, but this Mars energy is pushing you to finally take action on investments, partnerships, or healing work you’ve been contemplating. Mars in Sag is squaring Neptune in Pisces this week,  creating tension between your desire to hustle independently and your need to lean on  community support. This square might show up as wanting to do everything yourself financially while your friends are literally offering help, or being overly generous with your resources because someone’s sob story pulled on your heartstrings. This transit’s about learning when to receive support from your community versus when to set  financial boundaries so you’re not depleting yourself trying to save everyone. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th and your career sector is  finally getting some forward clarity after months of professional fog. Neptune  retrograde had you questioning whether your ambition was authentic or just what you  thought success should look like, and now direct motion helps you see which  professional path actually aligns with your soul versus which one just looks impressive. This is the last time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, completing a 14-year cycle of learning that reputation without authenticity is exhausting. Use these final weeks of Neptune in Pisces to make any last professional adjustments, solidify your authentic career direction, and prepare for Neptune entering Aries in January,  which will shift the collective fog from your career to your community, giving you even more clarity about your public path. </p>



<p>This is also the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius activating your partnership sector, and Mercury joins the party on December 11th, making relationship conversations and collaborative projects move quickly. You’re feeling bold about what you need from partnerships and finally saying it out loud instead of just adapting to what others want. Mars in Sag also squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating friction between your desire for direct, honest partnerships and the confusion still lingering in your career ambitions. This square might manifest as wanting clarity in relationships while your professional life feels foggy, or pushing partners to be decisive when you’re still figuring out your own path. The lesson? You can demand honesty in your connections while also admitting you don’t have everything figured out professionally.  </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, Neptune shifts direct in Pisces on December 10th in your expansion sector and suddenly your beliefs about what’s possible are getting clearer. For five months, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/neptune-retrograde-in-aries-pisces-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Neptune retrograde had you</a> questioning your entire worldview, spiritual practices, and whether your optimism was genuine or just denial, and now forward motion helps you see which philosophies actually serve your growth. This is the final time Neptune will  be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, wrapping up 14 years of learning the difference between faith that empowers and fantasy that enables. You might feel ready to commit to spiritual practices that work, book travel that’s been calling you, or simply trust your intuition about what expansion looks like now. Use this time to embody the wisdom you’ve gained instead of just philosophizing about it. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, this is the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius lighting up your wellness and daily routine sector, plus Mercury enters Sag on December 11th, making your mind and body aligned on creating sustainable habits. You’re motivated to optimize your health, work routines, and self-care practices with enthusiasm instead of just grinding through  obligation. Mars in Sag also squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating tension between your desire for structured routines and your need for philosophical  exploration. This square might show up as wanting to meal prep and stay disciplined while also feeling called to spontaneously book a spiritual retreat, or pushing yourself  hard physically while your beliefs are saying rest is sacred too. Remember that  wellness and expansion aren’t enemies… you can have daily discipline and spiritual freedom simultaneously. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th in your transformation and  intimacy sector, and the fog around your shadow work is finally clearing. Neptune  retrograde had you processing depth, shared resources, and vulnerability in ways that felt confusing… were you healing or just talking about healing? Now direct motion brings clarity about which transformation has been authentic versus performative. This is the last time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, completing 14 years of learning the difference between real intimacy and curated vulnerability designed for maximum impact. You might suddenly see which financial partnerships are solid, which intimate connections are worth the investment, or where you’ve been using depth as another role to play instead of actual healing. Use these final weeks of  Neptune in Pisces to solidify the transformation that’s been happening beneath your spotlight: the real work, not just the highlight reel. </p>



<p>This is also the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius activating your creativity, romance, and pleasure sector, and Mercury joins on December 11th, making your self-expression bold, unfiltered, and honestly unstoppable. You’re creating from inspiration, loving with passion, and expressing yourself without apologizing — peak Leo energy backed by  cosmic fire. But here’s the tension: Mars in Sag squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating friction between your desire to be seen boldly and the quiet transformation still happening in your depths. This square might manifest as wanting to perform your growth publicly when some of it still needs private processing, or creating art about your shadow work before you’ve fully integrated the lessons. The lesson? You can be both visible and still becoming, but make sure your external expression is backed by  internal authenticity. </p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, Neptune shifts direct in Pisces on December 10th and your partnership sector is getting the clarity you’ve been desperately craving. Neptune retrograde had you  questioning which connections were genuinely reciprocal versus which ones only  worked because you did all the emotional labor, and now forward motion helps you see  the difference clearly. This is the final time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, ending 14 years of learning that not everyone you try to fix actually wants to be saved. You might suddenly have peaceful detachment from relationships that were draining you, see which partnerships are built on authentic alignment, or simply trust your standards without guilt. Use this time to honor connections that actually meet you halfway and release the ones that were always one-sided. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, this is the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius lighting up your home and family sector, plus Mercury enters Sag on December 11th, making domestic conversations and foundation shifts move quickly. You’re ready to take bold action on your living situation, set boundaries with family, or simply make your private life match your public evolution. But here’s where it gets interesting: Mars in Sag squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating tension between your desire to revolutionize your foundation and the relationship clarity still integrating. This square might show up as  wanting to make big home changes while your partnerships are still finding balance, or having family drama triggered by the new standards you’re setting in relationships. The lesson is that changing your foundation and changing your partnerships happen simultaneously — they’re connected.  </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th in your wellness sector and  suddenly your daily routines are making more sense. For five months, Neptune  retrograde had you questioning which self-care practices actually worked versus which  ones just looked spiritual, and now direct motion brings clarity about sustainable  wellness. This is the last time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, completing 14 years of learning that optimization without intuition is just exhausting perfectionism. You might suddenly see which health habits serve your actual body versus which ones you maintain because they’re trendy, or realize that rest is productive even when it doesn’t look like anything. Use these final weeks of Neptune in Pisces to commit to routines that honor both your need for structure and your body’s need for flexibility: wellness that’s sustainable, not just Instagram-worthy. </p>



<p>This is also the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius activating your communication sector, and Mercury joins on December 11th, making your voice bold, direct, and maybe a little too honest if you’re not careful. You’re saying what you mean without diplomatic editing, which is liberating but could also burn bridges if you’re not intentional. Mars in Sag also squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating friction between your desire to speak bluntly and the wellness clarity still integrating. This  square might show up as saying yes to everything because direct communication feels good, then crashing physically because you overcommitted. Or being so honest in  conversations that you forget your body needs gentle energy too. The lesson is that your voice and your wellness are connected… speaking your truth should energize you, not deplete you. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, Neptune shifts direct in Pisces on December 10th and your creativity, romance, and pleasure sector is finally getting forward momentum. Neptune retrograde had you seeing your patterns in love and art clearly… were you creating from authenticity or performing depth? Now direct motion helps you express and connect from the real place instead of the romanticized ideal. This is the final time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, wrapping up 14 years of learning the difference between destiny and delusion in romance. You might suddenly have clarity about which creative projects deserve your energy, which romantic connections are actually a match (not just full of potential), or where you’ve been using intensity as a substitute for  genuine intimacy. Use this time to express yourself authentically and choose connections that are real, not just promising. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, this is the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius activating your money and self-worth sector, and Mercury enters Sag on December 11th, making financial conversations and value declarations bold and unapologetic. You’re ready to charge what you’re worth, invest in yourself confidently, or simply stop undervaluing your resources because of old scarcity programming. But Mars in Sag also squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating tension between your financial ambition and the  romantic/creative clarity still settling. This square might manifest as wanting to spend money on creative projects or romantic gestures while you’re still figuring out if they’re  aligned with your authentic expression, or being overly generous financially because someone’s potential pulled on your heartstrings. This is teaching you that your resources should support your genuine passions and connections, not the fantasy versions. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th in your home and family sector, and the fog around your foundation is finally lifting. Neptune retrograde had you questioning what home even means and whether your emotional roots were solid or just familiar, and now forward motion helps you see which domestic patterns actually support you. This is the last time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your  lifetime, completing 14 years of learning that not all family dynamics need to be understood or fixed. You might suddenly have clarity about living situations, peaceful  detachment from family patterns that no longer serve you, or simply trust that home can look different than you thought it should. Use these final weeks of Neptune in  Pisces to solidify your foundation with intention; create the sanctuary that actually grounds your expansive nature instead of trying to force roots where they don’t fit. </p>



<p>This is also your final full week of Mars in your sign, plus Mercury enters Sag on December 11th, making your energy, communication, and confidence absolutely  unstoppable. You’re on fire — motivated, optimistic, saying yes to everything, and honestly probably overcommitting because it all sounds exciting. But here’s where the cosmic tension comes in: Mars in your sign squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating friction between your desire to charge forward boldly and the home/family clarity still integrating. This square might show up as wanting to book spontaneous  trips while your foundation feels unsteady, or being so focused on external adventure that you’re ignoring emotional needs at home. Use this final Mars in Sag week to take bold action on your goals, but don’t ignore the voice asking you to also tend to your emotional foundation before you sprint toward the next horizon. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, Neptune shifts direct in Pisces on December 10th and your communication  sector is getting the clarity you didn’t know you needed. For five months, Neptune  retrograde had you questioning how you express yourself and whether your words  were connecting or just filling space, and now forward motion helps you speak with both emotional depth and actual clarity. This is the final time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, ending 14 years of learning that vulnerability in communication doesn’t mean weakness. You might suddenly feel ready to have conversations you’ve been editing into safety, express emotions without needing  perfect delivery, or simply trust that your words land even when they’re not perfectly composed. Use these final weeks of Neptune in Pisces to solidify the emotional intelligence you’ve developed in how you communicate… you can be both practical  and tender with your words. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, this is the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius activating your spirituality and closure sector, and Mercury joins on December 11th, making your inner work and private processing move quickly. You’re motivated to finish healing that’s been  lingering, release what’s been hiding in your subconscious, or simply take action on closure you’ve been contemplating. Mars in Sag squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating friction between your desire to aggressively heal and the communication  clarity still settling. This square might show up as wanting to process everything alone when you actually need to talk it through, or being so focused on spiritual bypassing that you’re not having the practical conversations necessary for real closure. Use this final Mars in Sag week to take action on your inner work, but don’t forget that speaking your truth is part of the healing process. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th in your money sector and suddenly your financial fog is clearing. Neptune retrograde had you questioning  your relationship with abundance and whether your manifestation practices were  actually building wealth or just making you feel better temporarily, and now forward motion brings practical clarity. This is the last time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, completing 14 years of learning the difference between spiritual abundance and actual financial strategy. You might suddenly see which income streams are sustainable, where you’ve been spending emotionally instead of  intentionally, or how to merge your idealism with actual money management. Use these final weeks of Neptune in Pisces to get honest about your finances; you can be both  spiritual and strategic about abundance, but only if you’re willing to look at the numbers. </p>



<p>This is also the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius lighting up your friendship and community sector, and Mercury enters Sag on December 11th, making your social life and collaborative projects move at lightning speed. You’re ready to connect with your people, launch group projects, or simply show up boldly in communities that celebrate your evolution. Mars in Sag squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating tension between your social ambitions and the financial clarity still integrating. This square  might show up as wanting to invest heavily in community projects while your personal finances need attention, or being so generous with friends that you’re depleting your own resources. Use this final Mars in Sag week to build collaborative projects and authentic community, but set financial boundaries so you’re not funding everyone else’s dreams while neglecting your own stability. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, Neptune shifts direct in your sign on December 10th and honestly, who even are you after this retrograde? For five months, Neptune had you reviewing your entire  identity, and now forward motion helps you actually be the person you’ve been  discovering instead of just contemplating them. This is the final time Neptune will be  retrograde in your sign in your lifetime, meaning 14 years of identity dissolution and spiritual evolution are wrapping up. You might suddenly feel clearer about who you are (boundaries and all), less apologetic about your sensitivity, or simply ready to define yourself instead of being everything to everyone. These final weeks of Neptune in your  sign before it moves to Aries in January are crucial: solidify the boundaries, own the  identity, trust the evolution. You’ve spent over a decade being cosmically dissolved and rebuilt; now it’s time to actually live as the person who emerged from the fog. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, this is the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius activating your career sector,  and Mercury joins on December 11th, making your professional ambitions and public communication bold and unapologetic. You’re ready to go after career goals, pitch yourself confidently, or simply be seen professionally as the evolved version of yourself instead of who people expect. But Mars in Sag squares Neptune in your sign this  week, creating friction between your career ambition and your still-integrating identity.  This square might show up as pushing yourself professionally while your sense of self is still settling, or being so focused on external success that you’re ignoring the internal clarity still forming. The lesson is that career and identity work together… your professional path should reflect who you’re becoming, not who you previously were. </p>

Books are always a great gift and if you’ve got a friend whose love language is physical touch but they haven’t exactly cuffed this cuffing season yet, I’ve got the steamy literature that’s going to keep them warm. These two books by Nigerian-British <a href=""https://www.bolubabalola.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">author Bolu Babalola</a> are hot and spicy and go together like fried yam, plantain and eggs (Nigerian fam, did I get that food combo, right?).

<em>This holiday season, we’ve found the gifts that feel great to get and even better to give. Shop our collection of editor-approved holiday gift guides <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-art-of-giving"">here</a>.</em><br /><br />‘Tis the season for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-makeup-looks"">holiday parties</a>, and we’ll be remiss if you show up to these celebrations empty handed. It’s also time for visiting family (and perhaps over-staying your welcome) so it’s thoughtful to offer up some goodies as a “thank you.” Or maybe you have someone on your shopping list who just moved into a new place (or is the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/areaware-gift-guide"">self-proclaimed homebody</a> of your friend group). In any of these cases, we’ve curated a list of host and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-housewarming-gifts"">housewarming gifts</a> that’ll elevate your giftee’s spaces.<br /><br />Depending on your budget (and how generous you’re feeling this holiday season), this guide features a range of products between $20 and $200. For homebodies, consider luxe Quince robes, artsy Piecework puzzles, and eclectic Fellow tea kettles. For the new resident, opt for a smart Hatch alarm clock, viral Anthropologie glassware, and cozy Outdoor Fellow candles. And for the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hosting-friends-at-home-socializing"">holiday party host</a>, you can cart up olive oil dipping sets, unsuspecting board games, non-alcoholic drinks. <br /><br />And maybe it’s no surprise that a majority of these gifts deal with gathering around the table — from Le Creuset mini cocottes and Lenox cream and sugar sets to Caraway bar accessories and BonBon candy boxes — because food is universally the way to the heart.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11947454.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=768&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=4%3A3"" /></figure></div>



<p>It’s a Sunday afternoon. I’m sitting in a quiet Queens cafe, stirring my coffee across from the man I love when he says, calmly and rehearsed, <em>“I’ve never truly loved you. And I don’t think I ever will.”</em></p>



<p><em>Ouch. </em>Safe to say, blueberry pancakes will never taste the same again. </p>



<p>What followed was every <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2019/11/8894605/stages-of-breakup"">stage of heartbreak</a> you can imagine. Remorse, regret, rumination. I was moving through the world carrying the weight of loving someone who, if I’m being honest, didn’t even like me most days. Crying on the subway became a routine and <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/0l8zYqoUeBYg47Gmevq9HZ?si=zWdALid9QeaRFRvp2IB-JQ"">Olivia Dean’s <em>The Art of Loving</em></a> became my lifeline. </p>



<p>Just when I thought the world had shrunk to the size of my grief, life threw me a bone — a random, unexpected invitation to Club Med in the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dominican-republic-adventures"">Dominican Republic.</a> I didn’t know it yet, but this was the plot twist my heart so desperately needed.</p>



<p>A few days later, I was on a plane to the DR with five nights ahead at the all-inclusive <a href=""https://www.clubmed.us/r/punta-cana/y?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=SEA_BR_ALL_Google_US_EN_Multi-Product_LH_Multi-resort&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=19311535181&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD5uxODXrDAIWhxBxghEmlVF6ni1O&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAlrXJBhBAEiwA-5pgwp8yNRnmlZJS6fLh022jduivzrsivPRIKjdz7kmlzNfD-LCZ53IUUBoCK8AQAvD_BwE"">Club Med Punta Cana</a> and <a href=""http://utm_source"">Club Med Michès</a>. I’d never been to the Dominican, but after hours of Googling, I was convinced I’d found the perfect escape. After all, nothing heals a heartbreak faster than an open bar, right?<br /><br />Not quite.</p>



<p>To no one’s surprise, I spent the first few nights at the resort broken. As Black women, we don’t always feel held in our relationships. The breakup felt like a generational curse. Most days, I felt like I was screaming into the void to be truly seen, accepting half-hearted apologies, and enduring comments meant to make me feel small. Somebody call Madea and tell her to get <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@jellydivinti/video/7258625800293862699?lang=en"">the grits ready!</a></p>



<p>Then it clicked. Black women deserve luxury. We deserve softness. And dammit, we deserve an all-inclusive resort! So, I would become my ancestors’ wildest dreams. I was going to have a love story worth writing, even if the prince charming was me. </p>



<p>So the next day, I dragged myself out of bed, threw on my swimsuit, and decided I was going to become the best boyfriend I ever had.</p>



<p><strong>Spa Time: Luxury Lifts The Soul</strong></p>



<p>My first few days were spent at<a href=""https://www.clubmed.us/r/punta-cana/y""> Club Med Spa: Punta Cana</a>, where I discovered just how much luxury can lift the soul. Mornings started with an Aperol Spritz overlooking the Atlantic from the Buena Vista Lounge. The sun wrapped around me, giving me the warmth I’d been craving for weeks. The lounge also offered a buffet selection from every corner of the globe, Italian, Asian, Mediterranean, you name it. And did I mention I’m an emotional eater? I shut that buffet down.</p>



<p>Every evening, I attended one of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMiH_bZIpfN/"">Club Med’s classic parties</a>. Their iconic all-white party gave me the perfect excuse to put on heels and feel like myself again. Live bands and circus shows pulled me out of my head and I ended up meeting women who spanned across multiple generations each sharing their own chaotic stories about men. And suddenly, I didn’t feel so alone. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11947455.jpeg?width=803&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=803%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p><strong>Self-care As The Ultimate Breakup Cure</strong></p>



<p>Of course, the self-care didn’t stop there. I dove into<a href=""https://www.clubmed.us/l/wellness-fusion""> Club Med’s Wellness Fusion program</a>, attending yoga classes and guided meditation led by resident experts. I realized reclaiming my peace of mind wasn’t just about escaping heartbreak. It was about actively choosing to nurture myself in every way possible.</p>



<p>The last couple of days were spent at <a href=""https://www.clubmed.us/r/miches-playa-esmeralda/y?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=SEA_BR_ALL_Google_US_EN_Multi-Product_LH_Multi-resort&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=19311535181&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD5uxODXrDAIWhxBxghEmlVF6ni1O&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAlrXJBhBAEiwA-5pgwleHQUK6O-JvQBLBM1YN1ErnyPfAbI4camT0OkMvB9I0XW5SrRTL5RoCZNAQAvD_BwE"">Club Med Michès</a>, and let me tell you, this resort was a dream. The two resorts aren’t close to each other, Michès is about a two-hour drive east, tucked away in the El Seibo province, surrounded by lush palm groves, rugged mountains, and secluded beaches. The property stretches across 93 acres, offering everything from treetop yoga to Zen pools, making it feel like its own private world.</p>



<p>The buffet at Michès felt gourmet and fresh and I happily sampled everything, for research purposes, of course. </p>



<p><strong>Dancing It Out &amp; Letting The Sun Set On Heartbreak</strong></p>



<p>And then there was Miches’ all-white party. I drank with new friends from all over the globe, screamed <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kffacxfA7G4"">Justin Bieber’s “Baby”</a> at the top of my lungs. It was a moment of pure, chaotic joy and a reminder of how big the world really is.</p>



<p>And last but not least, the beach. This was my favorite part. The sun danced across the turquoise waves and to no one’s surprise, I cried. Not from sadness, but appreciation for being alive. To be able to love and to feel. Honestly, I could have stayed there forever. </p>



<p>With sunsets on horseback, spa treatments, and yoga flows as part of Club Med’s Wellness Fusion program, I realized Michès wasn’t just a vacation, it was a masterclass in reclaiming peace, indulgence, and joy.</p>

<p>Listen, men suck. And they have since the beginning of time. The trip didn’t completely erase my heartbreak, but it reminded me there’s so much more to life than one person’s opinion. There’s joy, connection, and peace waiting to be found. You don’t need an all-inclusive resort to heal, but sometimes it helps to step away, tend to your spirit, and let the world slow down. As I continue this journey of self-discovery, I hope to carry this sense of wonder and ease wherever I go.</p>

<p>As a major fan of the original <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/05/110716/best-fresh-prince-of-bel-air-episodes""><em>The Fresh Prince of Bel Air</em></a>, I was hesitant but eager to see what its <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/07/11752424/adrian-holmes-bel-air-season-3-uncle-phil-interview"">reboot <em>Bel Air</em> </a>would bring to the characters I hold very dear to my heart. In 2022 when the show premiered, I loved it instantly. Recently, we’ve seen so many reboots come and go, but <a href=""https://www.peacocktv.com/stream-tv/bel-air"">Peacock’s <em>Bel Air</em></a><em> </em>has succeeded where others have failed . By taking a beloved 30-minute sitcom and turning it into a compelling &amp; layered one-hour drama, <em>Bel-Air</em> brought something fresh and exciting to the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/02/10874708/bel-air-carlton-fresh-prince-reboot-backlash""><em>Fresh Prince </em>franchise</a>. The storylines and character arcs were so detailed and nuanced that it felt similar but brand new. While the show is indeed a drama that gets the heart pumping — looking at you, Geoffrey — it still has the warm feeling of a family truly showing what it means to show up for one another. For three seasons, I’ve laughed and even cried while watching <em>Bel Air</em>, and trust me, Season 4 will continue to take us on a rollercoaster of emotions. I was heartbroken when it was announced that this would be<em> Bel-Air’s</em> last season, </p>



<p>What started as a concept on YouTube <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAfJpyBgcgA"">six years ago by Morgan Cooper</a> has since flourished into Peacock’s longest running <em>and</em> most streamed original series. The execution of this show from start to finish is a testament to Black ingenuity and a reminder that art is for <em>all</em> of us. As <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/cassiedamsel/"">Cassandra Freeman</a>, who plays Aunt Viv told me over Zoom, “Your vision is not trite, it is worthy.” She continued: “The greatest artistic expression is [that] you were born to change other people’s lives with your vision..” A word.</p>



<p>Ahead of the <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@peacock/video/7576291076558851341"">Season 4 premiere</a>, I was able to share some laughs and get insight from <em>Bel-Air’s</em> cast on how they feel about the series’ final season, the growth of  their characters,  and the legacy they think <em>Bel Air </em>will leave.</p>



<p><strong>Refinery29: Congrats on the final season!  How do you feel about the growth of your characters over four seasons?</strong></p>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/02/10869393/coco-jones-bel-air-hilary-colorism""><strong>Coco Jones</strong></a><strong> (Hilary Banks): </strong>I feel pretty satisfied with my growth. I think that Hilary started off [more] surface.  She’s this influencer, this cute girl with sickening outfits. It was very lighthearted at the beginning and then you get to unravel the plights that she goes through and it’s real life. [Now, she’s] feeling like she doesn’t have a seat at the table and wanting to be the chef and people wanting to downplay her recipes, like they’re too spicy. This girl comes from this zip code, this net worth, but it didn’t buy her this easy life. It doesn’t buy her self-discovery. She still has to go through the highs and lows to figure out who she is. I’ve enjoyed really playing her, her arcs and her peaks and valleys.</p>



<p><strong>Akira Akbar (Ashley Banks):</strong> I feel really satisfied with Ashley’s growth among these seasons. We really got to see a teenage girl and what she goes through. When I was a younger teenager, I fully didn’t know who I was. I was still trying to figure out myself. I was exactly like Ashley. I think the writers really did a great job of portraying that on screen.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11947337.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>BEL-AIR — “Soulmates” Episode 407 — Pictured: (l-r) Akira Akbar as Ashley, Coco Jones as Hilary — (Photo by: Anne Marie Fox/PEACOCK)</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Cassandra Freeman (Aunt Viv):</strong> [Viv] started off as a politician’s wife, and by the end of this, she becomes a self-expressed artist. It’s been an amazing journey to play her. She’s trying to figure out how to speak her truth and take care of other people and [she] realizes the best way to take care of other people is to take care of yourself first. Take care of your passions first. Tell people the truth first. It’s been an honor to play her storyline.</p>



<p><strong>Olly Sholotan (Carlton Banks):</strong> I’ve never been happier. I think that the beautiful thing that these writers have done is they’ve taken such good care of our characters’ journeys, and I just know that by the time you get to the very end, fans are gonna be so proud of Carlton’s growth.</p>



<p><strong>Jabari Banks (Will Smith):</strong> I was gonna say proud. Proud of the people that our characters have become. Proud of their journeys and proud of where they’re going next. </p>



<p><strong>Jimmy Akingbola (Geoffrey Thompson):</strong>  We started very gentle with Geoffrey. It was a lot of sitting in a mystery and not resting on the wave of nostalgia. I’m an actor that loves to get my hands dirty. [I’ll roll] up my sleeves, gimme the ball, let me play. So I was very happy when we got into Season 3, where we got to see behind the layers of Geoffrey. I think Season 4 is the perfect way to sort of wrap things up because again, his past comes through the door. My key word for this season for Geoffrey is fracture. He fractures everything that he built with the Banks family. And I think it teaches you that there are consequences to every action you do in life. And this is the first time that Geoffrey is not in control… He’s under pressure. </p>



<p><strong>Jordan L. Jones (Jazz):</strong> Just the growth of my character in general has just been a blessing because when we first get the roles, it’s like you’re just cool with whatever. I’m playing Jazz. I’m not a part of the family, but my character has layers and layers and layers and layers. Coming up to Season 4, I think one of the main themes is about Jazz’s evolution [and] unconditional love. And just being strong enough to tell your significant other, or the person that you love, how you actually feel no matter what the circumstances are. As men too, we need to do that more often instead of trying to be hard all the time. That’s one thing that my character definitely has taught me. Some of the things that sound weak or feel weak or seem like what you shouldn’t do, [aren’t like that at all]. It feels like don’t express your feelings this way, but no, actually, instead of thinking <em>that’s weak</em>, I think that it actually takes a very strong person to do that.</p>



<p><strong>Adrian Holmes [Uncle Phil]:</strong> Philip Banks started out being that pillar for the family and over time, we start to see cracks in that pillar and just how  life has weighed on him and the pressures of being perfect. I think that the theme for him is legacy and building legacy is not what we leave behind for the next generation. It’s what we leave within the next generation — the impact, the lives we change, you know. I think that Philip has done a great job over the arc of this series in just empowering Will, empowering Carlton, and the family, and just letting them know that they are enough and they have all the tools they need and just really building them up to be the best versions of themselves. Also just embracing the simple things in life and inner peace. I think he’s just been so busy outside, looking outside that he hasn’t been able to really focus on the inside and over the time where we see him in this season, he starts to really look within more and appreciate the little things.</p>



<p><strong>What mark or message do you think<em> Bel Air </em></strong><strong>will leave once it is over?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Coco: </strong>If I had to say it would be to stay close to the people who love you back. You know, at the end of the day, they will be your support system. And you can have great accomplishments, but don’t forget the people who love you back and who really, truly know you because there’s always seasons and things change. And you wanna have the people that will always support you as close to you as possible.</p>



<p><strong>Cassandra: </strong> Titles change, positions fade, great successes get forgotten. But family is why they say charity starts at home.That’s the first one. And then the second thing is outside of the show, just the birth of it. I hope people realize if you have a great idea, you too can be Morgan Cooper and drop your thesis for an idea on YouTube. And your platform is how many people agree with you. And you not only will change your life, you’ll change everyone else’s life. That’s the greatest artistic expression. You were born to change other people’s lives with your vision. Your vision is not trite, it is worthy. </p>



<p>​​<strong>Akira:</strong> I think the biggest takeaway from <em>Bel Air</em> is family over everything. You can have all the friends in the world. They can come and go, but your family is always there</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11947339.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>BEL-AIR — “The Maybes” Episode 401 — Pictured: (l-r) Adrian Holmes as Philip, Cassandra Freeman as Vivian — (Photo by: Anne Marie Fox/PEACOCK)</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Simone Jones:</strong> I feel like it’s the ability to reinvent yourself and love yourself while you do it. And, also to really take care of your community because we’re gonna mess up. I feel like relationships now have become very temporary and very fragile. And so to watch,even just as a cast, we go through like our teens together in LA and something you’ve never seen before, and watching these characters kind of mirror a similar turbulent time. I think I want people to leave with, like, your community is really important to yourself and also everybody else.</p>



<p><strong>Olly:</strong> Man, Simone really took the words just kind of right outta my mouth. So everything she said, but put it in a slightly deeper voice.</p>



<p><strong>Jabari:</strong> She said something that  really stuck me there too. The reinvention, uh, you know, reinvention and, not being afraid to reinvent yourself. Not being afraid to reinvent in general. You know we’ve shown the world that just ’cause you know, you reinvent something doesn’t mean that it has to be corny or it doesn’t mean that it has to, you know what I’m saying? It can be a totally different thing, you know?  We are the living proof of that. </p>



<p><strong>Jordan:</strong>  I think for me, I think for our theme has been constant throughout four seasons, where like we’re just showing, all aspects of the Black experience. What I love about our show is that each one of our characters is going through a different black experience. We got me like the hustler. That’s like, I’m not broke, but I ain’t, I ain’t Uncle Phil, you know? Uncle Phil’s like the leader of the household. And then we, then we got Geoffery, who’s black 007. We got Will fish outta water. We got Carlton, who is very privileged. So it’s like I can, I can go down the line, but we’re showing that the black experience, </p>



<p><strong>Adrian:</strong> We’re not a monolith.</p>



<p><strong>Jordan:</strong> The black experience is not just one experience, like, come over here we’re black this is what we do. It’s not like that, you know? </p>



<p><strong>Adrian: </strong>Absolutely. We’re not defined by our trauma or our struggle.  You know, our joy is something to be celebrated. Our joy is our superpower. It’s our fuel, and that’s what keeps us resilient. I always say, we can bend, but don’t break. Our black joy is what prevents us from, from breaking and always surviving no matter how difficult the situations are. The issue is we always find a way to prevail. Our show, Bel Air has done a fantastic job of really showcasing that, you know?. We’re not a monolith. We are redefining what the black experience looks like on television.We need more of that narrative moving forward.  And hopefully there’s not a huge void after our show. </p>



<p><strong>All right, we’re going to end on a game called Bothered or Unbothered. I’m gonna throw you some rapid-fires questions and your answer is either Bothered or Unbothered. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Keeping family secrets. Bothered or Unbothered?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Coco:</strong> Hmm. Bothered. I [like to] get everything out in the open. I really love therapy and I can’t with a secret. It’s like mold. It’s just going to get everywhere.  Plus, I can’t remember everything I done said. Now I gotta keep up with the lies. I don’t know what I just said to you.</p>



<p><strong>Cassandra:</strong> I’m kind of unbothered because I’m starting to realize that if I am interested in what you’re cooking up all the time and in your pot, it just steals my joy. You can live your whole life knowing everybody’s secrets and never even deal with your own. So if it’s my secrets, I’m bothered. I’m gonna get it out. If it ain’t bothering me in my house, listen, you go over there. I ain’t got time for that. It’s too much, I’m unbothered.  </p>



<p><strong>Akira:</strong> My secret, I feel like I’ll be bothered and I’ll be like, I need to tell somebody, but someone else’s I don’t care.</p>



<p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Unbothered by that.</p>



<p><strong>Jimmy:</strong> Unbothered!</p>



<p><strong>Adrian:</strong> Unbothered.</p>



<p><strong>Jordan: </strong>Everybody don’t have to know what your family is going through.</p>



<p><strong>Jabari:</strong> It depends on the secret.</p>



<p><strong>Olly:</strong> Yeah. Like keeping family [secrets] in the family? Bothered. But I’m OK with keeping family secrets from outside people. I ain’t trying to tell our business. </p>



<p><strong>Jabari:</strong> Sometimes you gotta keep a little secret. Sometimes you have to. It’s best for the family. Mom don’t need to know that. Mom don’t need to know what Cuzzo did when we went out. Mom don’t need to know that. Keep it secret.</p>



<p><strong>Olly:</strong> I think what’s in the dark will always come to the light, so I don’t know about this one.</p>



<p><strong>Simone:</strong> Oh no. I feel I’m a big fan of everybody having all the information and then doing what you will with it.</p>
