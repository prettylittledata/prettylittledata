The 14 independent brick chambers, constructed entirely using the load-bearing technique, present different historical moments as a sequential experience.</p>",

<p>Located in the municipality of Saint-Ferréol, Québec, the secondary residence presents itself as a retreat removed from the everyday, a place of escape that lives to the calm rhythm of the forest. The existing building bears the imprint of architecture inspired by Austrian chalets: a compact elevated volume, a light base, generous roof overhangs, and a strong presence of wood. These qualities, highlighted and carefully revealed, guided the integration and design of the extension.</p>",

<h4><em>WCAG color contrast is more than just text</em></h4><p>Most designers know the basics of web accessibility and color contrast. We’ve memorized that “normal text” (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html#dfn-large-scale"">24 CSS pixels and below</a>) needs to meet a 4.5:1 contrast ratio with its background, and “large text” (greater than 24 CSS pixels) needs to meet a 3:1 ratio.</p><p><strong>But WCAG (</strong><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/""><strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</strong></a><strong>) color contrast requirements don’t stop at text.</strong> There are lesser known WCAG success criteria (or “rules”) that are still very important for inclusive design; these ensure interfaces are usable to users with low vision or color blindness.</p><figure><img alt=""Viewing YouTube’s homepage with different vision simulations, like red-green color blindness and sun-glare"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-l5gevfqLDE88Ha5TisA6g.png"" /><figcaption>Viewing YouTube’s homepage with different vision simulations, like red-green color blindness</figcaption></figure><p>Some of these forgotten requirements circle around UI components, inline links, and data visualizations, which all have color contrast rules of their own. When these details are overlooked, users can’t tell what’s interactive, what’s linked, or what the data is actually saying (even if all the text uses accessible colors).</p><p>And these accessibility gaps aren’t edge cases. They show up in mature Design Systems, enterprise products, and well-intentioned designs because they live outside the accessibility standards designers tend to learn and adopt.</p><p>To avoid these gaps for the future, let’s go over 3 ongoing color contrast issues, how WCAG applies beyond text, and who exactly is impacted by color contrast.</p><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: I reference WCAG 2.1, Level AA standards. If your product needs to comply with Level AAA, required color contrast ratios increase (i.e., </em><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-enhanced.html""><em>normal text needs a 7:1 ratio</em></a><em> with its background).</em></blockquote><h3>UI components that look accessible (but aren’t)</h3><p>WCAG criteria: <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html"">SC 1.4.11: Non-Text Contrast (Level AA)</a></p><p>In plain english, this WCAG criteria requires that non-text UI elements that are interactive or communicate meaning have a <strong>minimum of 3:1 contrast ratio</strong> against adjacent colors (like the UI background).</p><p>But what is covered by “UI elements”? Basically, anything that a user can interact with or needs to see to use; such as:</p><ul><li>Buttons and button states</li><li>Form fields and their borders</li><li>Checkboxes, radio buttons, and toggles</li><li>Focus indicators</li><li>Icons that convey meaning or affordance</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Spirit includes text fields that do not meet contrast requirements with a 1.6:1 ratio"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mzlbjZWOHK27EOSS3N1QaQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.spirit.com/flight-status""><em>Spirit</em></a><em> includes text fields that do not meet contrast requirements with a 1.6:1 ratio; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong>Important note</strong><em>: If color contrast fails WCAG standards from the Design System level, the failure is replicated across all product adopters; it’s critical to check system UI component’s color contrast.</em></blockquote><h4>What designers miss and why it matters</h4><p>This is where many designs that are intended to be accessible quietly fail. Since these UI elements don’t contain text, they’re excluded from color contrast checks. And yes, text is very important to check, but so are the UI elements that provide any product its functionality.</p><p><strong>Common gaps within UI elements include:</strong></p><ul><li>Input borders that blend into the product background</li><li>Custom focus indicators that rely on subtle color shifts instead of high-contrast</li><li>Icon-only controls (like buttons) that don’t meet contrast on their own</li></ul><p><strong>When UI elements lack minimum contrast, users can’t reliably:</strong></p><ul><li>Identify what’s interactive or understand UI component states (like hover)</li><li>Navigate interfaces using only their keyboard</li><li>Complete forms without repetitive errors</li></ul><figure><img alt=""BBC includes a primary CTA that meets contrast requirements with a 4.58:1 ratio"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9lBpa8t8UhfH8HfsgOkvOQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.bbc.com/""><em>BBC</em></a><em> includes a primary CTA that meets contrast requirements with a 4.58:1 ratio; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><h4>Who are the users impacted?</h4><p>Though low-contrast UI elements affect everyone at some capacity (you might have to do some squinting), they make products unusable to people like:</p><ul><li>Users with low vision who need distinct visual styling</li><li>Keyboard users who depend on focus indicators that stand-out on the UI</li><li>Older users experiencing reduced contrast sensitivity</li><li>Users in low-contrast environments (i.e., sun-glare, small screens, fluorescent lights)</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: To check a UI component’s contrast (or any element that needs contrast), you can also use </em><a href=""https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-disability-simulator/olioanlbgbpmdlgjnnampnnlohigkjla?hl=en&amp;pli=1""><em>Web Disability Simulator</em></a><em> on any web page to simulate how it looks for users with color-blindness or cognitive disabilities.</em></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Red-green color blind simulation on YouTube with the Web Disability Simulator Chrome extension"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QWZyIWC5rf7neuUBx-RhKQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Red-green color blind simulation on </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/""><em>YouTube</em></a><em> with the </em><a href=""https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-disability-simulator/olioanlbgbpmdlgjnnampnnlohigkjla?hl=en&amp;pli=1""><em>Web Disability Simulator</em></a><em> Chrome extension</em></figcaption></figure><h3>Data visualizations with low contrast</h3><p>WCAG criteria: <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html"">SC 1.4.11: Non-Text Contrast (Level AA)</a></p><p>This accessibility gap references the same WCAG standard as UI components from above. But though data visualizations (data viz) may not always be interactive, they’re communicating meaningful information. Because of this, data viz must be perceivable without relying only on color and must meet a <strong>minimum 3:1 contrast ratio</strong> against adjacent colors.</p><p>This standard applies to:</p><ul><li>Chart lines, bars, and segments</li><li>Data points and markers</li><li>Axes, gridlines, or any reference lines that convey meaning</li><li>Legends or other visual keys</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Datylon includes a pie chart example that does not meet contrast requirements with a 1:1 ratio"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1OTh5HfA1C-vKeF7ZsJWag.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.datylon.com/resources/chart-library/pie-chart""><em>Datylon</em></a><em> includes a pie chart example that does not meet contrast requirements with a 1:1 ratio; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><h4>What designers miss and why it matters</h4><p>Data viz is an already complex and complicated UI element, so it’s even more difficult to bake in accessibility guidelines (especially if it’s being retrofitted). But color contrast issues are frequently found in charts and heatmaps that use the brand’s color palette rather than accessibility-tested colors.</p><p><strong>Common issues with data viz include:</strong></p><ul><li>Chart colors that are distinguishable in isolation but fail 3:1 contrast when touching one another</li><li>Data series using colors that aren’t distinguishable for color-blind users (i.e., red-green)</li><li>Thin gridlines with low contrast that disappear against the background</li><li>Charts that use multiple colors without secondary text indicators</li><li>Legends that depend on matching colors instead of labels or patterns</li></ul><p><strong>When data viz lack contrast and use color alone, users can’t:</strong></p><ul><li>Clearly and quickly understand trends in the data set</li><li>Confidently compare data without the feeling of guessing</li><li>Lose access to critical insights (especially when the data isn’t provided in another way)</li></ul><h4>Who are the users impacted?</h4><p>Again, all users are affected on some level by low contrast data viz. But other users need to be considered when designing the different types of charts so they can perceive and comprehend the same information as everyone else.</p><p>Some of these users include:</p><ul><li>Color-blind users (especially those with red-green color blindness)</li><li>Users with low vision who need high contrast for visual distinction</li><li>Users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from redundant cues</li><li>Users viewing charts on small screens or in poor lighting</li></ul><figure><img alt=""IBM Carbon includes a pie chart example that meets contrast requirements with a 7.76:1 ratio"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_Gsff7Yx_6gvh6DmjX7Djg.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://carbondesignsystem.com/data-visualization/simple-charts/#pie""><em>IBM Carbon</em></a><em> includes a pie chart example that meets contrast requirements with a 7.76:1 ratio; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: Simply by adding a white border between data viz elements, the colors become more distinguishable and meet accessibility guidelines.</em></blockquote><h3>Inline links that rely on low contrast color</h3><p>WCAG criteria: <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color.html"">SC 1.4.1: Use of Color (Level A)</a></p><p>Color cannot be the only visual means used to indicate a link on a web page. But not only that, inline links also must have <strong>at least 3:1 contrast</strong> against surrounding body text to be distinguishable (especially when the link doesn’t have an additional visual cue, <a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/F73.html"">like an underline or bold font weight</a>).</p><figure><img alt=""Atlanta’s Department of Transportation includes inline links that do not meet contrast requirements with a 1.58:1 ratio"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*k_84e7wKBM0IOAXis1ljeA.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://atldot.atlantaga.gov/""><em>Atlanta’s Department of Transportation</em></a><em> includes inline links that do not meet contrast requirements with a 1.58:1 ratio; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><h4>What designers miss and why it matters</h4><p>Inline links are such simple and subtle UI components; it’s easy to miss the checks needed to ensure accessibility. Designers typically think that since a paragraph of text meets the 4.5:1 color ratio requirement, any inline link using the same text color within the paragraph also passes. Since links are interactive elements, they have additional guidelines other than passing the color requirements for text.</p><p><strong>Frequent issues with inline links include:</strong></p><ul><li>Links that are differentiated only by an underline when the link receive mouse hover or keyboard focus</li><li>Link colors that meet contrast against the background, but not against adjacent text</li><li>Underlines removed for aesthetic or simplicity reasons</li></ul><p><strong>When inline links aren’t clearly distinguishable, users can’t:</strong></p><ul><li>Easily comprehend what’s interactive (especially when hidden in body copy)</li><li>Efficiently navigate a website or product page</li><li>Find important actions or information they need to complete a task</li></ul><h4>Who are the users impacted?</h4><p>I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again… this affects all users at some capacity. Inline links are not as recognizable to any user when the underline affordance or high contrast color is taken away. But for some users, it becomes impossible to identify links that could lead the user to information or product pages they need.</p><p>Users to consider when designing inline links include:</p><ul><li>Color-blind users who may not perceive color differences</li><li>Users with low vision who require visual affordances with high contrast</li><li>Users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from consistent patterns</li><li>All users scanning content quickly</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: A simple rule of thumb is to make a link look like a link for optimal usability and accessibility.</em></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Gov.UK includes inline links that meets contrast requirements with a 3.81:1 ratio AND are underlined"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3rOPtaAXaJBwGlfl3wKXcg.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid""><em>Gov.UK</em></a><em> includes inline links that meets contrast requirements with a 3.81:1 ratio AND are underlined; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>UI components, inline links, and data visualizations often fall outside the mental checklist of color contrast and accessible design.</strong> WCAG covers these elements, but it’s often overlooked when focusing on adequate contrast for text. This leads to websites and interfaces that look high contrast, but are near impossible to use for some user groups.</p><p>By spreading awareness to these accessibility gaps, we can expand how we define color contrast and better apply ideal accessibility practices. When these requirements are built into components, patterns, and Design Systems from the start, accessibility stops being a last-minute fix (or remediation plan) and becomes part of the design process.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=68cc224735b3"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/3-color-contrast-mistakes-designers-still-make-68cc224735b3"">3 color contrast mistakes designers still make</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Our brain is a prediction machine that can’t be stopped. No matter how hard we try, it will still build expectations.</h4><p>If you’re reading this, you’ve probably asked yourself the same question I always have: What exactly makes users subconsciously follow <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279871278_Color-in-Context_Theory"">Color Psychology</a>, <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles?srsltid=AfmBOopi3ws2HhTLq5t9k-4j8DcE9Ef_W6XddNvGAqidJSuDQZDW4XU4"">Gestalt principles</a>, and behavioral patterns like <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/hicks-law/"">Hick’s law</a>? Why does all of this work? Is there a way to understand the true nature of our brain and not just how it reacts, but why it predicts, expects, and perceives the world the way it does?</p><p>Now it’s time to go one level deeper — into the core of how our brain actually works. In this article, we’ll touch on one of the fundamental theories that helps me personally answer these questions, and I would love to share it with you. Buckle up, we’re shifting into nerd gear!</p><h3>The Free Energy Principle</h3><p>In 2010, in his paper <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2787"">The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_J._Friston"">Karl Friston</a> formally introduced a theory stating that every system, including living organisms, strives to minimize free energy. Simple enough: we don’t like surprises. But let’s take a closer look at what that really means.</p><figure><img alt=""Portrait of neuroscientist Karl Friston, author of the Free Energy Principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*SSE0hdbj4PtpTqh7.jpg"" /><figcaption>Karl Friston, Photo by Kate Peters (<a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/karl-friston-free-energy-principle-artificial-intelligence/"">WIRED</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The brain’s main task is to minimize the gap between expectation and reality. This gap is what the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle"">Free Energy Principle</a> defines as free energy. When the brain encounters unpredictable input, its stress level rises. And it’s crucial to understand: this isn’t about you as a person or a “user”, it’s about your brain. It’s not something we consciously control, but it’s something we can use.</p><p>After all, as humans, we don’t always chase predictability or comfort. Many people enjoy physical exercise, even though it’s technically stress for the muscles. We love movies with unexpected plot twists, and even comedy works by placing us in a familiar setup and then adding an unpredictable punchline.</p><p>That’s because we’re more than just our brains. The human organism and our consciousness is a complex system of subsystems, including our hormonal system, which can reward the brain with the right chemistry under stress, or reinforce behavior when we act in line with its internal “program.”</p><p>So, the Free Energy Principle is actually quite a complex theory, and there are different mathematical interpretations of it. But for simplicity and convenience, today we’re going to look at a more accessible formula:</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram of the free energy equation with each variable labeled."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OltXx93fAkWg9_8i2HvACw.png"" /></figure><p>We can break it down into several key variables:</p><ul><li><strong><em>F</em> </strong>— variational free energy: this is the result of our brain’s calculations. For the brain (or any predictive system) to remain in a stable, low-stress state, F should approach zero. The higher the free energy, the greater the stress or uncertainty in the system. This idea directly connects to the concept of entropy, the natural tendency toward disorder which both we and our brains constantly try to resist.</li><li><strong><em>s</em></strong> — sensory input: everything we receive from the external world — sounds, tactile sensations, visual images, etc.</li><li><strong><em>m</em></strong> — internal model: our internal representation of how the world works. Essentially, our expectations about external reality or specific aspects of it.</li><li><strong><em>P</em></strong><em> </em>— probability: represents the likelihood of a certain sensory input given our internal model (it’s defined by what’s in the parentheses but not part of the main operation). The result ranges from 0 to 1, since it’s a probability.</li><li><strong>−ln</strong> — natural logarithm: this function converts probabilities (values between 0 and 1) into a scale from 0 to infinity, making the difference between expectation and reality mathematically measurable but not limited.</li></ul><p>The higher the probability, the smaller the resulting value. In other words, our brain is “happy” when the probability of our expectations matching what we actually perceive equals 1 (maximum probability) — in that case, F=0. The lower the probability (P), the greater the amount of free energy (F): 1 = 0; 0.5 = 0.69; 0.1 = 2.3; 0.01 = 4.6.</p><p>Let’s look at an example. A user moves the cursor over something that looks like a button: text on a bright blue rectangle.</p><figure><img alt=""Interface example of a button with active cursor"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*idKF4TdvSkphrORSln-aGg.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p>m — the user expects that the button will somehow change its state, what we usually call a hover state.</p><p>s — nothing happens to the button itself, but the cursor changes.</p><p>Technically, the user’s expectations were violated. But since our internal models are more complex than a single visual reaction, the additional input (the cursor change) helped complete the picture. When the button eventually responds to a click, the user almost immediately forgets the odd interaction.</p><p>Their P might have dropped slightly, perhaps to 0.95, meaning the probability that their mental model still matches the incoming input remains very high. The amount of free energy is close to zero. The brain is calm, the user is satisfied, the product is sold.</p><p>Now let’s take a negative example. The user moves the cursor over the same button: the same text, the same blue rectangle. The user once again expects that clicking it will initiate a purchase, that’s our m (the internal model).</p><p>But the response is nothing: no color change, no cursor change, not even an error message. The user clicks repeatedly. Their P (probability) that their mental model matches the actual input, drops close to zero.</p><figure><img alt=""Interface example of a button with no hover feedback."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SN8vFhrI6J4EoE0zb1jFCA.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p>The brain starts trying to reduce the growing amount of free energy, sending out emotional signals. In this case, the button, the site, the entire interaction become irritants. Almost unconsciously, the user begins performing a series of random actions, trying to fix the problem.</p><p>And if we’re lucky, they eventually scroll up and notice that the email field is outlined in red with a message saying it’s required. They enter the email, click Buy again, and finally succeed.</p><p>Not as happy, but at least with a product on the way. All of this happened simply because the button had no disabled state, no visual communication that it couldn’t yet be pressed, forcing the user to waste five tense seconds clicking into nothing.</p><p>This is a fairly simple example that directly illustrates the relationship between our expectations and our perception of reality. But there are many others that you, as designers, already know well.</p><p>Take the Gestalt principles, for instance. We don’t just see a random collection of shapes but we instinctively try to group them and assign meaning. It’s something our brain does automatically, without conscious effort. That’s exactly why, at the beginning of this section, I emphasized that this principle isn’t about us as individuals. It’s about our brain itself.</p><p>Our brain constantly relies on its internal model, comparing it with the incoming sensory input we receive. And when the amount of free energy becomes too high, the brain automatically tries to fix the problem.</p><p>It starts to create new categories or groups, sending the necessary emotional signals to push us toward resolving the discrepancy. Sometimes, it adjusts the internal model itself, modifying m in the formula to reduce the gap between expectation and reality. That’s actually how we learn something new and this, in fact, can explain the very nature of our neuroplasticity.</p><p>But the brain can also go the other way distorting perception, effectively altering s in the formula, the sensory input itself. And that’s where we enter the territory of cognitive biases and perceptual illusions, an entire field in itself, and one that truly deserves the attention of us designers.</p><h3>Abduction is the key to humanity</h3><p>I’m confident in saying that almost every well-known principle we are using in design can ultimately be explained through the Free Energy Principle. But that doesn’t mean we, as designers, need to consciously apply it in our daily work. Good and even excellent designers usually operate within the beginner and intermediate levels of design psychology, and that’s more than enough to create meaningful, functional products.</p><p>For me personally, it has always been and still is fascinating to understand why things, principles, and rules work the way they do. That’s why I try to find explanations and new perspectives through different sciences. And psychology is one of them.</p><p>With this article, I’d like to invite you to look at the familiar design dogmas we follow from a slightly different angle and to try broadening our perspective.</p><p>In a world where AI already knows all these rules and can even create interfaces based on them, what may soon remain truly ours is our human curiosity, the desire to reach for truth, to question what we take for granted, and to look at problems from new angles, expanding the boundaries of any given task.</p><p>In the language of philosophy, specifically the branch of logic we, as humans and users, most often rely on deduction and induction.</p><p>Deduction is deriving consequences from established rules. When we build our hypotheses based on principles and patterns. All clickable elements should change their state on hover → This button changes its state on hover → Therefore, this button is a clickable element.</p><p>Induction is generalizing from experience. When we conduct direct user testing. Our user clicked 100 different buttons, and each time the button changed its state on hover → The user now expects that all buttons should change their state when hovered over.</p><p>But we, as designers, are expected to bring new ideas into the world.</p><p>So I’d like to invite you to look at another type of reasoning — abduction. It is the process of forming a hypothesis that could best explain an observation.</p><figure><img alt=""Triangular diagram showing the relation between abduction, deduction and induction with text descriptions."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/850/1*cLJYu98iQ0ogbr6iNisEuw.png"" /><figcaption>The relation between abduction, deduction and induction. <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Fig-A1-The-relation-between-abduction-deduction-and-induction-Several-alternative_fig1_48326326"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>We notice that users often close the payment page without clicking the button → What if the problem isn’t the button’s state but the emotional context — the anxiety or distrust triggered by the act of payment? → Let’s change “Pay” to “Secure Payment” and add the logos of trusted payment providers below the button to increase confidence.</p><blockquote>Abduction is the process of forming explanatory hypotheses. It is the only logical operation which introduces any new idea.<br /><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce""><em>Charles S.

It’s how we were able to achieve such heights of science and technology out of nothing.</p><p>And this ability appeared in us precisely because our brain tries to get rid of free energy. That’s why I believe this principle is important not only to try to explain user behavior, but it is fundamental for us, as creators, thinkers, and engineers.</p><h3>Final thoughts</h3><p>And as for the practical application of today’s topic, I suggest you the following approach as an experiment just for yourself: if you’re facing a tough problem or one you’ve solved a hundred times, try ignoring all design principles for a moment. Approach it as if you only had abduction to generate hypotheses and the Free Energy Principle to evaluate them.</p><p>Take a specific user and the situation they’re in, then sketch several alternative solutions you can score with the formula F = −ln P(s∣m).</p><p>Fill in the variables: m (what the user expected) and s (what the user actually saw). Then estimate which solution “minimizes free energy”, meaning yields the highest probability that perception will match expectation. And that’s your leading candidate.</p><p>And remember, psychology gives us the lens, design provides the tools, but the final verdict always belongs to the human being whose subjective perception can overturn any formula. That’s why theory is only valuable as long as it remains flexible, ready to yield to real observation, to the living unpredictable experience of the people we design for.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=0e557d122b81"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/lower-the-surprise-applying-the-free-energy-principle-to-ux-0e557d122b81"">Lower the surprise: Applying The free energy principle to UX</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

I mapped where intelligence lives, traced where humans direct and where AI executes.</p><p><strong>Here’s what they actually did differently.</strong></p><p><strong>The answer isn’t in the AI models. It’s in how they architect the flow of work between human and AI.</strong></p><p>This is what I call <strong>Intelligence Flow Architecture</strong> — the design of HOW cognitive work flows between human and artificial intelligence. Not what the AI can do, but how the collaboration is structured. Where does intelligence live? Who does what work? How do they hand off tasks?</p><p>This is a design discipline most product teams don’t know exists.</p><figure><img alt=""The essence of Intelligence Flow Architecture: Same models, different flows, completely different results.

Visualization created with Gemini AI.</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>What I mean by “architecture”:</strong> I’m not talking about software architecture (microservices, backend systems) or information architecture (navigation, content structure). I’m talking about <strong>architecting the “how”</strong> — the flow of cognitive work between human and AI. Who does what? Where does intelligence live? How do they collaborate? This is the discipline of designing intelligent systems, not just intelligent features.</p><p>Let me show you exactly how Perplexity and NotebookLM do it — and what you can apply to your own products.</p><h3>The architecture difference</h3><p>Here’s what people miss:</p><p>Both products run on the same foundation — large language models, vector embeddings, search APIs, retrieval-augmented generation.</p><p><strong>Same ingredients. Completely different results.</strong></p><p>Why? Because they architected different <strong>intelligence flows</strong> — different answers to these critical questions:</p><ul><li>WHERE does AI work autonomously?</li><li>WHERE does human provide direction?</li><li>HOW do they hand off work between them?</li><li>WHAT intelligence lives in which layer?</li></ul><blockquote><strong><em>In his </em></strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ""><strong><em>June 2025 keynote at Y Combinator</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Andrej Karpathy — former director of AI at Tesla and OpenAI co-founder — described this exact shift:</em></strong><em> </em>“LLMs aren’t just tools anymore. They’re becoming operating systems. The LLM is the CPU, the context window is the memory, and the real design work is architecting how this new computer orchestrates problem-solving.”</blockquote><p>That’s exactly what Perplexity and NotebookLM understood.</p><p><strong>Watch what happens:</strong></p><p>When you ask <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/"">Perplexity</a> a question, AI doesn’t give you search results to click. It searches, synthesizes, answers, and cites sources — all autonomously.</p><p><strong>Flow:</strong> You direct → AI discovers → You evaluate</p><p>When you upload documents to <a href=""https://notebooklm.google.com/"">NotebookLM</a>, AI doesn’t just “chat about your docs.” It analyzes, maps relationships, and generates insights — without waiting for instructions.</p><p><strong>Flow:</strong> You curate sources → AI orchestrates knowledge → You explore</p><p>These are different architectures of collaboration.</p><p>Let me deconstruct both — layer by layer.</p><h3>Perplexity’s intelligence flow architecture: Real-time discovery</h3><p>What makes Perplexity feel different from Google isn’t better search. It’s a different distribution of cognitive work.</p><h4><strong>THE DESIGN DECISIONS:</strong></h4><p>Someone architected this. Someone decided:</p><ul><li>AI executes search autonomously (you don’t click 10 tabs)</li><li>AI synthesizes while streaming (you don’t wait for batch results)</li><li>AI handles citations in real-time (you don’t copy-paste sources)</li><li>Human directs through conversation (you don’t fill search forms)</li></ul><p><strong>Cognitive split: ~20% Human (direction + evaluation) / 80% AI (discovery + synthesis)</strong></p><p><strong>What this feels like to you as a user:</strong></p><p>You ask a question. Seconds later, you’re reading a synthesized answer with sources — without opening ten browser tabs. It feels like the system “just knows” what you meant and found the answer for you.</p><p>That feeling isn’t magic. <strong>It’s architecture.</strong></p><p>The intelligence lives in the synthesis layer, orchestrating search and combining sources in real-time.</p><figure><img alt=""Perplexity’s 5-layer architecture showing the 20% human / 80% AI cognitive split.

Document understanding.</p><h4><strong>THE DESIGN DECISIONS:</strong></h4><p>Someone architected this. Someone decided:</p><ul><li>AI works only with YOUR documents (not the entire web)</li><li>AI builds knowledge graph invisibly (you experience results, not structure)</li><li>AI generates multiple formats from same knowledge base</li><li>Human curates sources and exploration direction</li></ul><p><strong>Cognitive split: ~30% Human (curation + direction) / 70% AI (analysis + orchestration)</strong></p><p><strong>What this feels like to you as a user:</strong></p><p>You upload research papers. Within seconds, the system “understands” them — not just text search, but conceptual understanding. It finds connections you hadn’t seen. It can explain your own documents back to you in different formats.</p><p>That feeling isn’t magic. <strong>It’s architecture.</strong></p><p>The intelligence lives in the knowledge processing layer, building invisible structure that enables multiple interaction modes.</p><figure><img alt=""NotebookLM’s 5-layer architecture showing the 30% human / 70% AI cognitive split.

Note Layer 4’s gradient — it’s collaborative, where human and AI work together in the interaction loop. </em>Visualization created with Gemini AI.</figcaption></figure><h4>The pattern they both reveal</h4><p>Both succeed because they architected intelligence flows with clear principles.</p><p>(If you look back at the hero infographic at the top, you’ll see the contrast: Traditional AI = features bolted onto existing UIs. Intelligence Flow Architecture = intelligence embedded in the system’s core.)</p><h4><strong>The four principles</strong></h4><h3>Principle 1: Design backward from autonomous execution</h3><p>Don’t start with: <em>“What interface should we show?”</em></p><p>Start with: <em>“What will the system DO autonomously?”</em></p><ul><li>Perplexity: Search + synthesize + cite</li><li>NotebookLM: Analyze + map + generate formats</li></ul><p>Then design everything else to enable that autonomy.</p><p>This inverts traditional software design. Traditional products started with the interface — buttons, menus, workflows — then built backend systems to support them. Intelligence-first architecture starts with autonomous execution and works backward.</p><blockquote><em>The shift is profound: from </em>“How will users accomplish this task?” to “What can the system accomplish autonomously?” <em>As </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_RjOhCkhvQ""><em>Satya Nadella</em></a><em> noted, we’re moving business logic from the application tier to the intelligence tier. The execution layer defines your system’s value — everything else exists to enable it.</em></blockquote><p>Without this inversion, you end up with “AI features” bolted onto traditional interfaces. The intelligence feels like an add-on because it IS an add-on. True intelligence-first architecture means intelligence is embedded as fundamental structure, not added as features.</p><h3>Principle 2: Embed intelligence in specific layers</h3><p>Don’t bolt AI on as features.</p><p>Architect where intelligence lives:</p><ul><li>Perplexity: Intelligence in synthesis layer</li><li>NotebookLM: Intelligence in knowledge processing layer</li></ul><p>The intelligence isn’t visible as “AI feature” — it’s structural.</p><p>The test for embedded intelligence: Can you remove the AI and still have a functional product? If yes, intelligence is bolted on. If no, it’s embedded.</p><p>Perplexity without its synthesis intelligence doesn’t exist — it’s not “Google with AI added,” it’s a fundamentally different architecture where intelligence IS the product. NotebookLM’s knowledge processing layer isn’t a feature you can toggle off; it’s the system’s foundation.</p><p>This architectural embedding happens in specific layers of your five-layer stack. Intelligence doesn’t float everywhere — it concentrates where transformation occurs. In Perplexity, that’s Layer 2 (synthesis orchestration). In NotebookLM, it’s Layer 2 (knowledge graph construction). Identify where YOUR system’s intelligence must live, then build everything to support that layer.</p><h3>Principle 3: Design clear human/AI boundaries</h3><p>Define precisely where AI works autonomously and where human provides direction:</p><ul><li>Perplexity: Human directs → AI discovers → Human evaluates</li><li>NotebookLM: Human curates → AI orchestrates → Human explores</li></ul><blockquote><strong><em>Think of this as creating control maps — the new journey maps for AI experiences.</em></strong><em> Instead of mapping what users do, you map who is in control (user, AI, or both) and when that control shifts. As </em><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/from-journey-maps-to-control-maps-17aac58b9dd9""><em>Rob Chappell</em></a><em> notes, </em>“The question is no longer ‘What is the user trying to do?’ The more relevant question is: ‘Who is in control at this moment, and how does that shift?’”</blockquote><p>This is the evolution from traditional user journeys to human-AI collaboration flows.</p><p><strong>This pattern is becoming so clear that in June 2025, Karpathy dedicated his Y Combinator keynote to it.</strong> He calls it “partial autonomy” — systems where AI generates and humans verify in a continuous loop.</p><p>The architectural insight: <strong>The fastest generation-verification loop wins. Not the most autonomous AI.</strong></p><p>That’s why <a href=""https://cursor.com/"">Cursor</a> (coding), Perplexity (search), and NotebookLM (research) are succeeding — they optimized the loop, not the autonomy.</p><h3>Principle 4: Optimize for cognitive distribution</h3><p>Not: “Can AI do this task?”</p><p>But: “SHOULD AI do this, or SHOULD human?”</p><ul><li><strong>Human strengths:</strong> Goal definition, judgment, creative direction, evaluation</li><li><strong>AI strengths:</strong> Discovery, synthesis, pattern recognition, execution</li></ul><p>Both products make this mapping explicit in their architecture.</p><p>This requires mapping cognitive strengths systematically. From your Hybrid Cognition Map: Humans excel at goal definition, context understanding, judgment calls, ambiguity resolution, ethical decisions, creative direction, and stakeholder intuition. AI excels at information retrieval, pattern recognition, rapid iteration, consistency, tedious execution, multi-source synthesis, and 24/7 availability.</p><p>The magic happens at the intersection — not human OR AI, but human AND AI working in complementary strengths. Perplexity distributes: human defines information need (judgment), AI discovers and synthesizes (execution). NotebookLM distributes: human curates sources (context), AI processes and orchestrates (synthesis).</p><p>Poor cognitive distribution creates friction. If you ask humans to do what AI does better (tedious data processing), or ask AI to do what humans do better (strategic judgment), the collaboration fails. Design explicitly for strengths, not just capabilities.</p><figure><img alt=""The complete framework: Four principles that define how Perplexity and NotebookLM architect human-AI collaboration.

I took photos of the worksheet, showed them to an AI, and asked it to generate similar exercises. Seconds later: a new practice set, perfectly matched to her level.</p><p>She finished it. Asked for another. I already had everything loaded — another set appeared in seconds.</p><p><strong>This wasn’t impressive because the AI was smart.</strong> It was impressive because I’d designed the <strong>how</strong>: Photo → Parse → Generate → Verify → Iterate. A five-second intelligence flow that would have taken me 30 minutes manually.</p><p>That’s Intelligence Flow Architecture in daily life.</p><p>Now let’s make it actionable for your team.</p><h3>From analysis to application</h3><p>You’ve seen how Perplexity and NotebookLM architect intelligence flows.</p><p>Now let’s make this actionable for your team.</p><p>The method works for any product workflow — from email to CRM to document editing.</p><p>Here’s the four-step process:</p><h3>How to apply intelligence flow architecture to your product</h3><h4><strong>STEP 1: Map your current workflow</strong></h4><p>Pick one core workflow. List every step users do manually.</p><h4><strong>STEP 2: Identify cognitive work</strong></h4><p>For each step, ask:</p><ul><li>Is this discovery work? (AI strength)</li><li>Is this synthesis? (AI strength)</li><li>Is this judgment? (Human strength)</li><li>Is this goal-setting?

Here’s how Intelligence Flow Architecture transforms a common workflow — email composition.</p><p>Traditional Gmail requires you to manually type, edit, format, and send — roughly 5 minutes of writing every word. Intelligence Flow Architecture redesigns this as a 6-layer collaboration where AI handles autonomous execution while you provide direction and judgment.</p><p>The result: 30 seconds instead of 5 minutes.

The Tesla lesson</h3><p>Before we dive into what this means for product teams, let’s address the obvious question: <strong>Why design for partial autonomy instead of full autonomous agents?</strong></p><p>In his June 2025 keynote, Karpathy shared a telling story from his five years building autonomous systems at Tesla:</p><p>In 2013, he took a perfect self-driving ride in a Waymo — zero interventions, flawless. He thought: “Self-driving is imminent.”</p><p><strong>That was 12 years ago.</strong> Even now, <a href=""https://waymo.com/"">Waymo vehicles</a> that appear driverless still require significant human teleoperation and oversight.</p><blockquote><strong><em>His warning applies directly to product design:</em></strong><em> When AI generates massive outputs — 10,000 lines of code, complete research reports, fully redesigned interfaces — you haven’t saved time if verification takes hours. </em>“When I see things like ‘oh 2025 is the year of agents,’ I get very concerned. This is the <strong>decade</strong> of agents.”</blockquote><blockquote><strong>“We have to keep the AI on the leash,”</strong> <em>Karpathy emphasized. Not because AI isn’t capable, but because </em><strong><em>verification speed determines actual productivity.</em></strong></blockquote><p>This is why Intelligence Flow Architecture prioritizes the generation-verification loop over full autonomy. The goal isn’t to remove humans from the loop. <strong>The goal is to make the loop spin as fast as possible.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Karpathy’s lesson from 12 years at Tesla: Fast generation-verification loops beat pursuing full autonomy.

Loop speed determines productivity, <em>not autonomy level. </em>Visualization created with Gemini AI.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>A note for designers:</strong> You might be thinking “I’m not a system architect. Can I actually apply this?” Yes. Intelligence Flow Architecture isn’t about backend engineering — it’s about design thinking applied to human-AI collaboration. Start small: Pick one workflow. Map where human directs vs where AI executes. That’s architecting intelligence flows. You’re already doing this thinking — now you have language for it.</p><h3>What this means for product teams</h3><p>Here’s what changes when you adopt Intelligence Flow Architecture:</p><h4><strong>BEFORE (AI Features):</strong></h4><ul><li>PM says: “Let’s add AI to this workflow”</li><li>Designer asks: “What should the AI button look like?”</li><li>Engineer builds: API call to GPT → show response</li><li>Result: Feature that feels bolted on</li></ul><h4><strong>AFTER (Intelligence Flow Architecture):</strong></h4><ul><li>PM asks: “What cognitive work should AI handle autonomously?”</li><li>Designer maps: Human direction → AI execution → Human evaluation</li><li>Engineer architects: Intelligence layer + orchestration layer + execution layer</li><li>Result: System that feels intelligent</li></ul><h3><strong>The pattern</strong></h3><p>Perplexity and NotebookLM didn’t ask “How do we add AI?”</p><p>They asked: “How do we architect collaboration between human and artificial intelligence?”</p><p>That’s the difference between an AI feature and an intelligent system.</p><p>That’s Intelligence Flow Architecture.</p><p>And that framework — deciding where intelligence lives, how work distributes, when systems execute autonomously — <strong>that’s intelligence-first architecture.</strong></p><p><strong>Same AI models.</strong><br /><strong>Different architecture.</strong><br /><strong>Completely different experience.</strong></p><p>Now you know why.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ace59eeda531"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/perplexity-and-notebooklm-dont-use-better-ai-they-use-better-intelligence-flow-architecture-ace59eeda531"">Perplexity and NotebookLM don’t use better AI—they use better intelligence flow architecture</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Despite its limited design, many users felt understood and emotionally “seen,” attributing empathy and intent to the system, a phenomenon later called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect""><strong>“ELIZA effect</strong></a><strong>”. </strong>From the very start, people related to even basic conversational software as if it had a mind of its own.</p><p>Long before modern AI, product and brand design had already embraced personality as a differentiator. <a href=""https://imgs.search.brave.com/bGxPgSeNEiF9Eug7c4YNn_bgulI2vwDeCDJqyq_KKtU/rs:fit:860:0:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9kMmlq/ejZvNXhheTF4cS5j/bG91ZGZyb250Lm5l/dC9hY2NvdW50XzQ4/MS9TY3JlZW5zaG90/MjAxOC0xMS0wOGF0/MTFfMDRfMThBTV81/NDI1N2M0MTI4M2Mx/NWI0YTMxNTRiNjMz/ZDRlY2IxNV84MDAu/cG5n"">Mailchimp’s playful feedback</a> or <a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/slack-copywriting-what-they-say-to-9-6-million-pageviews-every-month-4351888f1c2c"">Slack’s quirky copywriting</a> showed how tone and character could give otherwise functional software a distinctive emotional presence. Design theory reinforces this! <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_Design""><strong>Norman’s emotional design theory</strong></a> shows that products which evoke emotion foster attachment and loyalty<strong>,</strong> while <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism""><strong>anthropomorphism</strong></a><strong> </strong>explains our instinct to assign human traits to machines.<strong> </strong>Sherry Turkle’s research at MIT shows that people form <a href=""https://sts-program.mit.edu/book/alone-together-expect-technology-less-eachother/""><strong>“artificial intimacy”</strong></a> with conversational agents assigning them emotions, motives, and moral qualities as if they were caring entities rather than tools.</p><p>In modern AI systems, this projection becomes even more consequential. Anthropic, for example, shapes <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyJj9RxSsBY""><strong>Claude</strong> around a deliberate character</a> — thoughtful, principled, and balanced — by embedding values and ethical reasoning into how the model thinks and responds.</p><p>Thus<strong>, designing for personality shifts from a branding layer to a core interaction layer </strong>that shapes trust, adoption, and long-term habits.</p><h3>Emerging personality patterns in AI products</h3><p>This framework draws from my work on a virtual pet at <a href=""https://www.ideo.com/"">IDEO</a>, a companion robot at <a href=""https://miko.ai/"">Miko.ai</a>, and most recently an AI tutor at <a href=""https://www.getsupernova.ai/new-home"">SuperNova AI </a>— supported by research (reference list in the end) across HCI, HRI, and narrative design .</p><p>Personality in AI systems is shaped much like a human character with underlying internal traits that drive behavior and external expressive cues that make those traits visible.</p><ul><li><strong>Internal layer</strong> refers to the traits and personality cues like values, worldview, personality archetype, backstory and contextual intelligence.</li><li><strong>External layer</strong> expresses these traits through the surface with avatar, typography, tone of voice, motion, and other multi-modal feedback cues.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""A diagram showing an AI personality model with Internal Layer components on the left and External Layer components on the right, all pointing to a central AI icon. Internal elements include Purpose/Worldview/Values, Personality Archetype, Backstory, and Contextual Adaptation. External elements include Visual Identity, Communication Style &amp; Copy, and Multi-Modal Feedback."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0JMf5NrH1dafeI4lMdwX0w.jpeg"" /></figure><p>The interplay between these layers and their individual elements determines an <strong>AI product’s position on the personality spectrum from minimal to expressive to fully characterful</strong> — and ultimately shapes how people perceive and engage with it.</p><h3>1. Purpose, worldview and values</h3><h4><strong>Purpose</strong></h4><p>Purpose is the starting point and shapes the AI’s <em>relationship</em> to the user based on what it helps them accomplish. <br /><br />An AI built to <em>teach</em> will naturally behave differently from one designed to <em>co-create an app or automate commands</em>. <strong>Defining purpose guides —</strong></p><ul><li><em>What is this AI supposed to accomplish for users?</em></li><li><em>What should be the nature of AI-human relation? Is the interaction like interacting with a tool help, a pet/ companion or a collaborator/ supervisor/ assistant?</em></li></ul><p>After purpose, worldview and values form the underlying belief system that makes the AI’s behavior consistent and predictable across different situations.</p><h4><strong>Worldview</strong></h4><p>Defines <em>how the AI interprets problems and reasons under uncertainty, </em>whether it approaches tasks with caution, optimism, curiosity, or analytical detachment. <strong>Defining worldview guides —</strong></p><ul><li><em>How should user needs/ problems be approached?</em></li><li><em>What matters most in its interactions?</em></li></ul><h4><strong>Values</strong></h4><p>Define the AI’s ethical boundaries and priorities — the principles it won’t break. They influence not only <em>what</em> the AI refuses, but <em>how</em> it refuses, shaping the emotional tone of guardrails. <strong>Defining values guides —</strong></p><ul><li>What are the rules it shouldn’t break?</li><li>How should it protect or guide the user?</li></ul><figure><img alt=""A split-screen image explaining Purpose, Worldview, and Values using Claude’s system prompt. On the left, three labeled terms — Purpose (“why the AI exists”), Worldview (“how it interprets the world”), and Values (“the rules it won’t break”) — are shown with arrows connecting them. On the right, a screenshot of Amanda Askell’s tweet highlights parts of Claude 3’s system prompt in color-coded boxes labeled Purpose, Worldview, and Values."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*EO0MpbmaiHlyA7ekC7eTLw.jpeg"" /></figure><p><a href=""https://x.com/AmandaAskell/status/1765207842993434880"">Amanda Askell tweet about Claude’s system prompt</a>, reveals how purpose, worldview, and values are explicitly programmed into AI personality — directly shaping how millions of users experience Claude assistant.</p><h3>2. Archetypes</h3><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype#:~:text=An%20archetype%20can%20be%20any,,%20or%20%22merge%22%20into.""><strong>Brand archetypes</strong></a> are universal character prototypes drawn from Carl Jung’s psychology. Brands adopt these familiar personas to evoke specific emotions and embody core values.</p><p>Selecting an archetype helps determine whether your AI feels like a playful entertainer (Jester), a wise advisor (Sage), an empathetic supporter (Caregiver) or any of the other twelve classic archetypes.</p><figure><img alt=""A brand-archetype wheel showing twelve archetypes (Creator, Innocent, Sage, Explorer, Outlaw, Magician, Hero, Lover, Jester, Everyman, Caregiver, Ruler). Various AI products and robots are placed around the wheel to match their archetypes: Moxie and Wysa near Caregiver, Alexa and Siri near Everyman, Miko and Lovots near Lover/Jester, Replika and Character.ai near Lover, Claude near Sage, Anki Cozmo near Explorer, Cursor near Hero, Pepper and Gemini near Creator"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YV4ajRGbz6FDVgyPmzmTPQ.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Choosing an<strong> archetype layer guides</strong> —</p><ul><li><strong>How the AI presents itself visually</strong> — avatar style, colors, motion design</li><li><strong>How the AI communicates</strong> — tone of voice, phrasing, pacing, and conversational behavior.</li></ul><p>For example</p><ul><li><strong>Claude (Sage) </strong>embodies a wise, thoughtful assistant focused on clarity and balanced reasoning. Its warm, calm visual identity and starburst icon signal structure and trust, while its communication style stays gentle, honest, and reflective.</li><li><strong>Wysa (Jester + Coach)</strong> a compassionate, judgment-free companion focused on emotional support and guided healing. Its cute penguin mascot and playful tone signal approachability and warmth, while its communication style stays empathetic, encouraging, and grounded in evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy.</li></ul><p>Archetypes resonate at a subconscious level guiding the design to maintain character consistency and thus strengthening user experience and engagement.</p><h3>3. Backstory</h3><p>In consumer-facing AI, where emotional connection is key, backstory adds coherence and emotional weight to the interaction. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet_on_the_Holodeck"">Janet Murray’s Hamlet on the Holodeck</a> shows that when virtual characters have defined roles and histories, it enriches user interaction and making the system feel more alive and intentional.</p><figure><img alt=""An image of the Miko robot on the left and a chat transcript on the right, where Miko answers questions about its name, age, abilities, and identity with playful personality. A caption explains that Miko robots have rich backstories users uncover through conversation."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MXwMEzP9HuRskUPhuce0Bw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Some successful consumer products which follow this pattern strongly are</p><ul><li><a href=""http://www.miko.ai""><strong>Miko</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The companion robot invites children to ask, <em>“Where did you come from?”, “What’s your job?”, “Are you a boy or a girl?”</em> — revealing his backstory and personality through playful dialogue.</li><li><a href=""https://www.tolans.com/""><strong>Tolan</strong></a><strong>:</strong> General-purpose assistants take on the persona of friendly aliens from planet Portolah, each arriving with distinct personalities and quirks to befriend their human companions</li><li><a href=""https://character.ai/""><strong>Character.ai</strong></a><strong>:</strong> A massive platform where users chat with millions of AI characters, each with detailed backstories, personalities and fictional histories to explore.</li></ul><h3>4. Context adaptation</h3><p>Contextual adaptation is the AI’s ability to respond appropriately to a user’s <strong>situational context or emotional state</strong> and shaping tone, language, and pacing to feel human and supportive.</p><p>This relies on techniques like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_recognition""><strong>emotional state recognition</strong></a> (detecting sentiment or tone), <a href=""https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/ai-mirroring-behaviors""><strong>conversational mirroring</strong></a> (reflecting the user’s phrasing or energy), and <strong>contextual personality shifting</strong> (adjusting tone or style based on task complexity or user mood) .</p><ul><li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa""><strong>Alexa</strong></a>, though simpler, varies its vocal delivery: sounding excited when offering good news (“It’s sunny all day!”) or disappointed when reporting a loss, reinforcing its role as a helpful household companion.</li><li><a href=""https://answeringagent.com/blog/5-ways-ai-adapts-tone-for-customer-calls""><strong>T-Mobile’s AI</strong> reduced customer complaints by 73%</a> through instant detection of negative sentiment and tone mirroring</li><li><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.replika.app&amp;hl=en_IN&amp;pli=1""><strong>Replika</strong></a>, performs deep, long-term mirroring. It learns a user’s vocabulary, emotional patterns, and interaction style over many conversations, gradually shaping its own language, tone, and even “personality” to reflect the individual.</li></ul><h3>5. Visual identity</h3><p>Visual identity is often the first layer through which users infer an AI product’s personality. Design decisions around logo, avatar, color, type and even hardware shapes cues.</p><figure><img alt=""Image showing Perplexity’s geometric logo, Claude’s serif typography, and the Lovot robot. A caption notes that Claude’s serifs feel warm and credible, Perplexity’s sans-serif feels modern and analytical, and Lovot’s soft design conveys a companion-like personality."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sQ7i9Nt3p9T041kdfEAYoQ.jpeg"" /></figure><ul><li><strong>Logo/ Avatar/ Embodied identity </strong>give an AI a recognizable “face” and act as an immediate proxy for personality. For instance, <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/"">Perplexity</a>’s logo, is minimal, geometric, and abstract and it subtly animates during search to cue users that AI is creating an answer. On the other end of the spectrum, more expressive AI products like <a href=""https://lovot.life/en/"">Lovot</a> uses a physical body, large eyes, soft materials, and even personalised clothing to project warmth, affection, and a companion-like presence.</li><li><strong>Typography</strong> contributes to brand voice in chat interfaces. For example, <strong>Claude’s serif typography conveys</strong> warmth, maturity, and approachability — qualities that align with its thoughtful, privacy-first positioning. <strong>Perplexity’s geometric sans-serif communicates</strong> modern technical clarity and reliability, reinforcing its role as a precise, research-oriented tool.</li><li><strong>Illustrations/ Imagery:</strong> Supports communicating information in a delightful way</li><li><strong>Motion and Animation: </strong>Motion guidelines define how elements animate, transition, and respond to user interaction.</li><li><strong>Color palette</strong> reinforce AI personality archetypes by leveraging emotional associations rooted in color psychology. For example. blue signals trust and calm (Alexa), bright green colours signal playfulness and growth (Duolingo, Miko) and muted tones as professionalism (Notion AI).</li></ul><h3>6. Communication style &amp; copy</h3><p>Communication style and copy are also the most visible expressions of an AI’s personality. Whether experienced through <strong>voice or text,</strong> elements like <strong>tone</strong>, <strong>phrasing</strong>, <strong>pacing</strong>, <strong>formality </strong>work together to communicate character’s personality and guide user experience.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Duolingo’s writing guidelines page showing the section on ‘Voice’. It describes how Duolingo’s brand personality appears through words, supported by four voice qualities — expressive, playful, embracing and worldly — with a sidebar menu on the left and an illustration on top"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZOGg6drhwqpcvegAtbKosw.jpeg"" /></figure><h4>Core elements shared across voice and chat interfaces</h4><ul><li><strong>Tone</strong> sets the emotional posture: formal tones (e.g., <em>Sage</em>, <em>Ruler</em>) project authority and professionalism, while informal tones (e.g., <em>Everyman</em>, <em>Jester</em>) build warmth and approachability. For example, <a href=""https://www.capitalone.com/digital/tools/eno/"">Capital One’s Eno</a> uses “First things first” is perceived as friendlier than “Here is the first step” in user research.</li><li><strong>Phrasing and vocabulary</strong> reflect personality cues. For instance, a Caregiver might say “<em>“Let me walk you through this , we’ll figure it out together,”</em>,” while Sage personas might use precise, technical terms (e.g., “<em>“Let me explain the details step by step</em>”).</li><li><strong>Pacing and prosody</strong> (in voice), or <strong>structure and grammar</strong> (in text), shape rhythm and emphasis which is key to emotional delivery and comprehension. Models from <a href=""https://elevenlabs.io/docs/models"">ElevanLabs V3</a> and <a href=""https://cartesia.ai/sonic"">Cartesia</a> uses intentional pauses and inflection to simulate human-like and expressive speech generation.</li></ul><h4>Modality differences: Voice vs. Chat</h4><p>Voice-first interfaces (e.g., Alexa, Miko) rely heavily on <strong>prosody, timing, and conversational repair</strong>. Spoken interactions are adaptive — users naturally adjust tone, pacing, or emphasis when there’s confusion.</p><p>In contrast, chat-based interfaces (e.g., Claude, Perplexity) emphasize <strong>structural clarity, grammar, and concise phrasing</strong>. Because written responses can’t be corrected mid-delivery, users expect a higher degree of accuracy and polish.</p><h3>7. Multimodal feedback</h3><p><strong>Multimodal feedback</strong> refers to the way an AI system expresses its internal states such as listening, thinking, processing, or responding sometime called <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/chain-of-thoughts""><strong>Chain-of-thought (CoT)</strong></a><strong> display </strong>through various visual design elements and multiple sensory channels. These channels can include <strong>visual cues</strong>, <strong>voice and sound design</strong>, <strong>micro-animations</strong>, <strong>LED lights</strong>, or <strong>haptics</strong>.</p><p><strong>It allows users to <em>see</em>, <em>hear</em> or <em>feel</em> what the AI is doing</strong>, making the interaction more interpretable, human-like and trustworthy.</p><figure><img alt=""Four examples of AI systems showing how they express internal state: Replit panels with micro-animations for thinking steps; Alexa device with LED ring phases — idle, listening, thinking, speaking; Duolingo voice call using animated character face; Moxie robot using voice, eyes, and body movement"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2C-JnFqBHXrmlqKoxgfg-g.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Multimodal feedback varies across products depending on how much personality is intended for the product.</p><ul><li><a href=""https://replit.com/ai"">Replit AI</a>, <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/"">Perplexity</a>, <a href=""https://claude.ai/"">Claude</a><strong> </strong>relies on <strong>icon animations</strong> and <strong>microcopy</strong> to communicates system states.</li><li>Alexa devices like <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B8V1LZ3?ref=amzdv_ucc_dp_lod__B09B8V1LZ3&amp;th=1"">Echo dot</a> uses <strong>LED lights</strong>, <strong>voice tone</strong> and <strong>sound effects</strong> to express internal states. The glowing ring is soft and household-friendly, reinforcing her calm, helpful persona.</li><li><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/moxierobot/"">Moxie</a> robot<strong> </strong>combines <strong>voice and non verbal cues </strong>— screen animations, sound effects and hand and body movements<strong> </strong>to communicate states in a child-friendly, playful way consistent with its worldview of empathy and curiosity.</li></ul><h4><strong>Interaction rhythm and timing</strong></h4><p>Interaction rhythm and timing are critical to how AI systems communicate through multimodal cues. Research in human–robot interaction (Michalowski et al., 2007; Hoffman &amp; Breazeal, 2007; Breazeal, 2003) shows when robots align their timing with humans — pausing at the right moments, matching conversational pacing, or synchronizing gesture and gaze —<strong> interactions feel more alive</strong>, more engaging<strong>, more lifelike, and more trustworthy</strong>.</p><p>Products like <strong>Tolans</strong> use coordinated animations, eye-gaze, and motion timing to signal attention and emotional states, making the characters feel alive. Voice agents like <strong>Alexa</strong> similarly use rhythmic cues — brief pauses, LED pulses, and vocal pacing — to create a sense of responsiveness. In both cases, achieving the right timing transforms abstract AI behaviour into something that feels intentional, expressive, and socially fluent.</p><h3>When does personality matter?</h3><p>The fundamental question to ask before designing for personality, if your product needs one and how complex?</p><p>Not every AI system needs a quirky mascot or empathetic voice. The role of personality depends on what problem the product is solving and what users expect from AI<em>.</em></p><figure><img alt=""This chart provides a relative comparison of each product based on how many personality patterns it uses and the depth of their implementation. A more detailed scoring breakdown will be released in a separate article"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MVIKD6P88sCcG2q5gd0IIQ.jpeg"" /></figure><p><strong>In enterprise, B2B SaaS, </strong>or high-utility applications<strong>, personality is kept limited </strong>like professional tone, clear explanations and minimal flair as seen in tools like Ema, Salesforce Einstein or Intercom where u<a href=""http://www.ijdesign.org/index.php/IJDesign/article/view/861/366"">sers value accuracy, compliance, and integration</a>.</p><p><strong>In</strong> <strong>consumer AI</strong>,<strong> personality is often the differentiator</strong> driving engagement, trust, and habit-building where functionality is commoditized. Duolingo’s cheeky Duo, Miko’s playful child companion, Alexa’s polite household voice, Claude’s thoughtful collaborator persona, and Lovable’s friendly co-creative tone all show how personality, delights, stickiness, and emotional connection become as important as utility itself.</p><h3>References</h3><ul><li><a href=""https://www.anthropic.com/research/collective-constitutional-ai-aligning-a-language-model-with-public-input""><strong>Collective Constitutional AI</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Aligning a Language Model with Public Input by Anthropic</li><li><a href=""https://www.anthropic.com/news/introducing-claude""><strong>Introducing Claude</strong></a> (March 2023) by Anthropic</li><li><a href=""https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262533485/hamlet-on-the-holodeck/""><strong>Hamlet on the Holodeck</strong></a>: The future of narrative in cyberspace.

<h4><strong>The comfort and the cost of knowing what’s next.</strong></h4><figure><img alt=""A product roadmap displayed on a reddish-brown background.

They want to build a product which they are super sure of; they have their pitch deck ready, investors are lined up, and they want to hit market in six months. All they need is a working product: an embodiment of their mission. As a product manager, you do the usual. In a short duration, you conjure up enough details to come up with a roadmap. A plan with all the required features to put the product in the hands of potential users. It is well-detailed, with release dates and launch timelines. You align the team and start development. <strong>What could go wrong?</strong></blockquote><p>Working constantly with early-stage startups has taught me one thing: startups are a minefield of uncertainty. If a founder believes they have all their answers on <strong>day one, </strong>they pretty much have a dream to sell you. It might just say that on the pitch deck.</p><p>In my experience, anything a startup builds in its early stages is a whole lot of assumptions wrapped around a concrete vision. When you start treating these assumptions as ground reality and planning features rather than outcomes, you create a recipe for trouble. A well-documented, timeline-based feature roadmap is often where the problem starts.</p><p>These plans actually give founder and teams a false sense of security. However, teams very quickly realise that:</p><p><strong>Feature roadmaps limit exploration and discovery. </strong>If the boundaries of exploration are limited to a predefined feature set, you quickly find yourself boxed in. Instead of giving the team ample time to actually solve problems, you end up preparing for the next release cycle as the team focuses on building the current feature on the list.</p><p><strong>Feature roadmaps leave little room for new information.</strong> These plans operate under the conviction that all underlying assumptions have been fully priced in, locking potential ideas, features, and deadlines in advance.</p><p>However, as you start working on the product, the <strong><em>act of building</em></strong> itself brings significant clarity. New information either challenges or validates previously made assumptions. As a result, you are compelled to carve out a new shape for the product — one that reflects an evolved understanding, sometimes with a focus on revised outcomes.</p><p>This is where feature roadmaps fail to adapt. They are built for predictability, and any change often leads to delays or scope expansion. You then have to resist new ideas and information just to stay on track with previously set timelines.</p><p><strong>Feature roadmaps have a confidence bias. </strong>They inherently believe that the solution, from the outset, is already fit for the market in its current shape. What is supposed to be a strategic and continuous discovery turns into a scheduling exercise. In reality, just because you are solving the right problem doesn’t mean the current shape of the product will perform well in the market.</p><p><strong>Feature roadmaps underestimate the invisible work.</strong> Development teams often require a fair amount of time and effort to figure out the <em>right</em> way to build before dipping their hands into execution. This is difficult to plan for, as the paths of discovery are not always linear. Sometimes you have to spend more time delivering the same planned item. The timeline is affected not by new demands, but by a well-defined scope.</p><blockquote><em>A PM I know used to say ‘</em><strong><em>Roadmaps are the glue that makes strategy stick to planning’. </em></strong><em>Lately, I feel the longer they are planned for, the </em><strong><em>harder</em></strong><em> they set in, making things very difficult and </em><strong><em>costly</em></strong><em> to pull away.</em></blockquote><p>Don’t get me wrong. I am not saying they are a bad exercise. Early-stage startups <strong>need</strong> to have a vision and a pathway to get there, and roadmaps serve that purpose effectively. What I do take issue with is the way of thinking that propagates building ‘all the things we thought were correct <strong>then</strong>’ at the cost of ‘what we know <strong>now’,</strong> treating previous ideas as gospel truth. A product being built just for the sake of it. It’s a lose-lose situation for everyone.</p><p>So, what’s the alternative?</p><ol><li><strong>Building roadmaps around outcomes, not features. </strong>This gives your team the agility to adapt to one of the umpteen pathways that could be used to arrive at the desired outcome. Outcome-focused roadmaps also ensure that the team focuses on solving the problem at hand and not just checking stories off a to-do list.</li><li><strong>Make clarity your top priority. </strong>Be it through initial research, alpha releases, or targeted experiments, your first three months should focus on validating your assumptions. These will help you plan a more robust roadmap, rather than building a product on ideas made of sand.</li><li><strong>Use the 666 method. </strong>A way of mapping horizons based on what your startup needs to focus on over the next <strong>6 years, 6 months, and 6 weeks</strong>.</li></ol><ul><li><strong>Next 6 years. </strong>This is your north star, the team’s vision of the future six years from now. This will change and evolve as your team learns how your product is built, adopted, and integrated into your users’ lives. Please do not create a fixed plan for six years.</li><li><strong>Next 6 months. </strong>This is your pathway of putting the product in front of your users for the very first time. It is a culmination of all your current beliefs, learnings and insights. The team should assume that only 50–60% of this plan will actually get built. The rest will emerge based on what you discover along the way, creating a need to revisit and revise this plan every couple of months.</li><li><strong>Next 6 weeks. </strong>This is where a feature roadmap makes sense. Once your team is confident on what needs to be built next, create a small, focused plan. Once locked in, changes here should be minimal. Make sure you know what you want to learn from the outcome of these six weeks. <strong>This is the only horizon where going granular is appropriate.</strong></li></ul><p><em>Lastly, learn to </em><strong><em>balance</em></strong><em> and </em><strong><em>realign</em></strong><em>. Planning works best when delivery and discovery are mapped together, each informing and correcting the other.</em></p><p>References:</p><ul><li>Yojji: Roadmap Startup Guide &amp; Examples: <a href=""https://yojji.io/blog/roadmap-startup-guide-examples"">https://yojji.io/blog/roadmap-startup-guide-examples</a></li><li>Clarify: The Art of Product Roadmapping for Early-Stage SaaS Founders: <a href=""https://www.clarify.ai/blog/the-art-of-product-roadmapping-for-early-stage-saas-founders"">https://www.clarify.ai/blog/the-art-of-product-roadmapping-for-early-stage-saas-founders</a></li><li>Product School: Now–Next–Later Roadmap Framework: <a href=""https://productschool.com/blog/product-strategy/now-next-later-roadmap"">https://productschool.com/blog/product-strategy/now-next-later-roadmap</a></li><li>Product plan: Product roadmaps for startups vs enterprises: <a href=""https://www.productplan.com/learn/product-roadmaps-startups-versus-enterprises/"">https://www.productplan.com/learn/product-roadmaps-startups-versus-enterprises/</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9360d392758b"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/why-feature-roadmaps-dont-work-for-early-stage-startups-9360d392758b"">Why feature roadmaps don’t work for early-stage startups</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Aries </h3>



<p>As you enter the last days of 2025, a rare and exciting opportunity arises at work. Before impulsively taking on the<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/salary-story-flight-risk-job-promotion""> gig or promotion</a>, ensure that you have a clear emotional discourse and seek advice from others before making a decision. If you play your cards right, you may be able to set a contract on your terms, which will be more beneficial to you.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Taurus </h3>



<p>Taking a cooking or art class (you should venture out of town<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/solo-trip-maldives-luxury-destination""> for a retreat</a>) might enrich your talents, allowing you to understand that you are gifted and have much to give. You’ll be the top student, getting praise from the teacher and peers. The compliments are uplifting, urging you to take this topic seriously. In time, you’ll be the one educating and inspiring others.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Gemini </h3>



<p>Even though you might not realize it, you have the chance to<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/manifest-goals-2025-zodiac-signs""> manifest the life you want</a>. You are not aware of your magic and strength until now, so enhancing and enchanting your soul and spirit is key. You’ll be amazed at how much you can accomplish when you are intentional about your goals. Believe in yourself and all you do. You got this, Gemini!</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Cancer</h3>



<p>Consider taking a chance by expressing your heartfelt sentiments. Being open to those you care about will jump start a new beginning in the relationship.

The season seems bright knowing that you’ll be able to power through with the support of your squad.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Leo </h3>



<p>This is a moment in which you can thrive, both mentally and physically. If there are any patterns or habits that you would like to improve upon, now is your chance to do so. You can start by engaging in wellness rituals (like yoga, meditation,<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2024/04/11705856/young-people-loneliness-hiking-group-friendship""> or a hike</a>) that connect to your body, mind, and spirit. The endeavor relaxes your aura, making tiy more mindful.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Virgo </h2>



<p>The solstice urges you to plan a party with friends and invite loved ones. The group effort will not only bring you closer together, but the process will also allow you to see that you have much in common, from the theme and decor to the food being served. It will be a blast having a reason to spend time with your besties.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Libra </h3>



<p>Dorothy Gale wasn’t wrong when she said: “There’s no place like home.” Remember that your dwelling provides safety and comfort, which is why you’re in the mood to get cozy and snuggle up<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-christmas-movies""> in bed with movies</a>. If you decide to be social, host a few of your closest family members for a low-key lunch to reflect on old memories and to discuss what’s coming ahead.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Scorpio </h3>



<p>You possess many excellent qualities, and it’s time for you to showcase your true self. Stop holding back and controlling how people perceive you. To cultivate genuine relationships, you must be your authentic self at all times. Chances are that people will accept you and adore the person you are on the inside. Let them get an insider peek instead of hiding who you are.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Sagittarius </h3>



<p>Your leadership skills are on fire! For the first time in a while, you’re taking charge and making moves at the office.

Your motto: “All for one and one for all!”</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Capricorn </h3>



<p>The sun shines on you, Capricorn! You will relish in popularity and awesomeness, helping you invigorate your vigor and fierceness. In honor of your return from hibernation, try to design a day of pampering that centers around doing what makes you feel extraordinary. Special activities, such as going to a concert or getting a pedicure, can be uplifting and cathartic to your energy and vibes.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Aquarius </h3>



<p>Only you can figure out what makes you happy and how you can advance in life. Trusting your intuition will guide you forward. The moment you let go of your rational way of processing situations, the easier it will be to get to the bottom of situations. Additionally, it will feel good to<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-intuition-gut-instinct-personal-safety""> trust your instincts</a> and listen to what your heart is telling you.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Pisces </h3>



<p>We often take the community we live in for granted, which means your sensitive nature may wish to give back to the neighborhood by doing volunteer and humanitarian work. No matter what you choose to partake in, the objective is to pay it forward. Being part of something bigger than yourself allows you to see that you can change the world with kindness and compassion.</p>

<p><em>Content warning: This article discusses violence in a way that may be distressing to some readers</em>.<em> It was original published on Refinery29’s Australia edition.</em></p>



<p>On the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/hanukkah-in-australia"">first night of Hanukkah</a>, beneath the quintessential glow of a Sydney summer evening, globally beloved and iconic <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/International/alleged-bondi-beach-gunman-charged-15-counts-murder/story?id=128475208"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bondi Beach</a> turned from a scene of joy to one of terror. Families and friends had gathered for a festive beachfront celebration, lighting the menorah and singing songs, when gunfire shattered the laughter. Two gunmen, a <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/live/ckgk391yzm7t"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">father and son</a> armed with rifles, opened fire on the crowd, killing at least 15 people (including a child) and injuring dozens more. One attacker was shot dead by police, and the other was wounded and arrested amid the chaos. Australian authorities swiftly declared it a terrorist attack motivated by antisemitic hatred, an assault on the Jewish community that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said “struck at the heart of the nation”. What should have been a night of light and hope became Australia’s worst mass shooting in nearly 30 years.</p>



<p>The next morning, Bondi’s sands lay empty and silent, an unheard-of phenomenon for one of the most popular shorelines in the country, save for investigators pacing the cordoned-off area. Since then, the stories and the heroism of bystanders who tried to stop the shooters have dominated headlines. Yet the impact of this attack cannot be measured only in lives lost or injuries. Its shockwaves have rippled far beyond those who stood on the sand that night; the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/how-to-help-bondi-beach-terror-attack"">tragedy</a> has seared itself into the psyche of people around the world, including many who were nowhere near Bondi Beach when it happened.</p>



<h2>Beyond The Shore</h2>



<p>Not even in the hours after the attack, but during, phones pinged with news alerts across Australia and overseas. Many who read the headlines or watched grainy and graphic videos felt a chill of grief and fear. It didn’t matter that they were seeing it through a screen; their hearts broke, and their fear was felt in real time. In Sydney, thousands gathered at vigils the next day, mourners at Bondi laid flowers and sang prayers under the open sky. Similar tributes appeared in other cities, in Melbourne, in London outside the Australian High Commission, and beyond — a sign that the world was mourning with Bondi. </p>



<p>“Collective trauma can impact how we view the world and how we see ourselves in it — the social norms and security we were used to are challenged, making us feel unsafe and unsure, and grieving the world we understood,” explains Mental Health Therapist <a href=""https://www.baretherapy.com.au/meet-tammi"">Tammi Miller</a>.<br /></p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>These are valid feelings — the goalposts of our beliefs have been moved, and we’re trying to redefine what they are. With a big event like the Bondi attack, we’re also being fed new information over hours and days, meaning those goalposts continue to shift. It’s a lot of work mentally, and we can feel exhausted, overwhelmed and anxious.</p><cite>tammi miller, Mental Health Therapist</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>According to Principal Psychologist at Umeed Psychology, <a href=""http://www.umeed.psychology.com.au"">Anushka Phal</a>, this reaction is a form of collective trauma or vicarious trauma. “Humans don’t exist in isolation; we’re part of communities,” Phal describes this as identity-based trauma: “For people with histories of trauma, chronic stress, racism, gender-based violence, or migration stress, the nervous system is already primed to ask: Am I safe? Am I next? The body doesn’t treat it as ‘news’ — it treats it as confirmation.” She adds: “Even secondhand exposure can activate the threat system — particularly in a 24/7 media environment. The nervous system doesn’t respond to logic; it responds to danger cues, which can show up as hypervigilance, irritability, flatness, grief, and even physical symptoms.”</p>



<p>Decades of research on vicarious traumatization show that people can develop stress symptoms from simply hearing about or seeing footage of violent events. Our brains, in a sense, replay the horror as if we were there. <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/lifting-the-veil-trauma/202001/watching-the-news-can-be-traumatizing"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">One study</a> even found that individuals with no prior trauma who watched distressing news reports showed symptoms of secondary traumatic stress, such as anxiety, nightmares, and feelings of helplessness. In the case of the Bondi attack, it brutally resonated far and wide – from the Jewish community in Sydney to anyone who has ever set foot on Bondi.</p>



<p>As <a href=""http://www.mymirror.com.au"">Rachel Tomlinson</a>, a Sydney-based therapist (and one of many professionals volunteering at community support sessions this week), points out: “Trauma is processed through the nervous system first, not the thinking brain. That’s why people feel sick, shaky, or disconnected — the body is responding to a perceived threat even before we can name the emotion.”</p>



<p>She continues, “Even indirect exposure — like media — can activate this system. Freeze or dissociation responses are just as real as panic. You might feel emotionally flat, stuck, or spaced out. It’s a survival response, not weakness.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11950751.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=682&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A341"" /><figcaption>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA – DECEMBER 15: Candles are lit at the Bondi Pavilion as people pay tribute to the victims of a mass shooting at Bondi Beach yesterday, on December 15, 2025.

<h2>Coping With The Invisible Wounds</h2>



<p><strong>1. Mental health experts emphasize that your feelings are valid.</strong> Even if you were not physically present. There’s no need to say, “I wasn’t there, so I shouldn’t be this upset.” Grief, anger, fear, outrage, and numbness, all of these are natural responses. “Give yourself permission to feel whatever comes,” advises Anushka Phal. “Don’t bottle it up just because you weren’t at the scene. You’re human, and at our core, humans care about each other.” Acknowledging the pain is a first step to healing. That might mean talking to friends or family about how the news affected you, or writing down your thoughts in a journal. Some find comfort in attending vigils or religious services to honor the victims, as coming together in solidarity can ease the sense of powerlessness. Others might light a candle at home or say a prayer as a personal act of remembrance. </p>



<p><strong>2. Limiting media exposure</strong> is another important coping strategy. While it’s natural to seek information after a traumatic event, endlessly scrolling through graphic images or videos can retraumatize you. “Being unable to control when or what imagery you see following an event like the Bondi attack can make it difficult to self-regulate,” says Miller. “Repeated exposure can trigger a stress response — difficulty sleeping, irritability, trouble concentrating. It’s important to remember that you are safe in these moments, to look around you and name three things you can see, touch, feel, practise deep breathing and centering, and definitely to seek support from a confidant or trained mental health professional.”</p>



<p><strong>3. Connecting with others is crucial in these times.</strong> The Bondi Beach community has exemplified this – within 24 hours, thousands of people gathered to comfort one another, sing together, and remind themselves that they are not alone. Whether you attend a local vigil or simply call a friend to talk, sharing your feelings can lighten the emotional load. Sometimes just hearing someone say “I feel it too” can be profoundly validating. If your distress persists or feels overwhelming, consider reaching out to a mental health professional. Therapists are aware that indirect trauma is real and can help you work through it. There is no shame in seeking help; it doesn’t matter that “it didn’t happen to me,” what matters is that it affected you, and getting support is a sign of strength, not weakness.</p>



<p><strong>4. Finally, it can be healing to channel your emotions into positive action. </strong>Donate to a victims fund. Support crisis lines like Lifeline, which are seeing a huge surge in calls and will continue to through the holidays. Volunteer your time if you have capacity — or if you don’t, drop off a meal, check in on a friend, walk someone home. Acts of care don’t need to be big to matter. They just need to happen.</p>



<h2>Finding Light After The Darkness</h2>



<p>In the days since the attack, the golden sands of Bondi have been blanketed with flowers, candles, and handwritten messages. Strangers hug each other on the promenade, united in grief. The air carries the mingled scents of saltwater and candle wax as the sun sets each evening over a beach that is healing from trauma seen and unseen. The emotional wounds from that night will take time to mend, and some scars may never fully fade. But amid the sorrow, there is a steadfast resolve that the forces of hatred will not break the spirit of the community. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>You don’t have to be at the centre of an event to be affected by it. Being human, compassionate and empathic means being impacted by violence and loss, especially when it hits close to home or touches your identity. Minimizing your pain only prolongs it. </p><cite>RACHEL TOMLINSON, REGISTERED PSYCHOLOGIST</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>For anyone struggling with heavy emotions after this tragedy, know that you are entitled to those feelings, they speak to your empathy, and that with time and support, the fear and anguish can evolve into strength and meaning. </p>

<p>While we all may have very clear visions of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/06/11430657/carrie-bradshaw-style-it-girl"">Carrie Bradshaw</a> running around Manhattan in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/05/10490787/sarah-jessica-parker-sex-and-the-city-carrie-manolo-blahnik-heels"">Manolo Blahnik heels</a> and spending hours playing dress up in luxury stores, the real life style icon Sarah Jessica Parker, <em>today</em>, is opting for quick and efficient online shopping with the help of Google.<br /><br />“I don’t consider myself a very good shopper because I’m seduced by imagery and what looks great on somebody else. But there’s a truth about my size and what colors look good on me,” Parker exclusively tells Refinery29. And thanks to <a href=""https://blog.google/products/shopping/how-to-use-google-shopping-try-it-on/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Google’s “Try On” feature</a>, Parker can actually envision herself in pieces before hastily carting them up. “I think this is one use of [AI] that feels not only benign, but potentially quite helpful. It creates clarity about how things may or may not look on you.”<br /><br />While I’m personally quite weary of AI in general, as I was speaking to SJP, I knew I had to try this feature for myself. Because although I wax poetic about all the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gifts-for-fashion-lovers"">best fashion to shop</a> online, I find myself gravitating more towards in-person shopping because I’m unsure how many pieces will fit my petite-yet-curvy body. With that, I used some of SJP’s best <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-fashion-beauty-trends-forecast-2025-2026"">holiday season dressing</a> advice to see how her favorite styles actually look on myself through Google Try On.<br /><br />The technology came out earlier this year, but it’s just gotten a refresh with <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DSXfkjDjVkT/"">SJP’s new holiday campaign</a>. According to <a href=""https://blog.google/products/shopping/google-shopping-ai-mode-virtual-try-on-update/"">Google’s blog</a>, the virtual try-on technology allows “shoppers to try on billions of items of clothing from our Shopping Graph. It’s powered by a new custom image generation model for fashion, which understands the human body and nuances of clothing — like how different materials fold, stretch and drape on different bodies.”<em><br /></em><br />Again, I was skeptical but excited at the same time.<br /><br />Self-declared “lousy shopper” Parker explains: “I just think it’s really helpful and really user-friendly, and I’m hoping it kind of cuts out some of the chaos and hysteria around shopping,” adding: “I think this idea of Google Shopping with the ability to actually see it on your person takes some of that intimidation away, but also you feel more assured that you’re purchasing something that will likely really suit the occasion and your person.”</p>

<p>It works by searching for fashion items on Google and clicking into a product suggestion before seeing a “try it on” pop-up button. Then you can upload a full-body image of yourself and the AI technology realistically adds the clothing onto your body. It also has a follow-up feature where you can save and send the image to your group chat if you need a second opinion. (And if you’re wondering, SJP says she would definitely text looks to longtime collaborator and <em>Sex and the City</em> costume designer <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/and-just-like-that-season-3-carrie-fashion-costumes"">Molly Rogers</a> for fashion help). <br /><br />As SJP went on listing her favorite festive attire — from houndstooth and platinum to “chiffon big skirts from the eighties with a leotard” (à la Carrie Bradshaw) and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-colored-tights"">jewel-tone tights</a> paired with patent leather Mary Janes — I put some to the test with Google Try On.<br /><br />After uploading a couple of full-body photos of myself wearing fitting clothing as suggested on my phone, one photo worked best and saved into Google so it could be reused for every new product I selected. (I think in the future I’d opt for a tank top and biker shorts for the most accurate depiction of my body, especially for skin-baring pieces, but I was pleased with how Google auto-generated my body, especially in mini dresses (see below).<br /><br />“I went to a party the other evening and the host was wearing a pinstripe suit, but the pinstripes were all sparkly, and I loved it,” Parker says. And so I searched for just that and clicked on a suit from Sandro via <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-nordstrom-gifts-sale"">Nordstrom</a>, which I could see myself standing in within 10 seconds. (It’s important to note that the feature doesn’t work on the first sponsored products that pop up on the search page, and not <em>every single</em> retailer offers it.)<br /><br />I also wanted to virtually try on a vintage-inspired <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-dresses-2025-latina-brands"">party dress</a> after Parker declared: “I personally love plaids and tartans this time of year. It’s really old fashioned, but I see more and more of it and it’s really exciting.” Eager to try a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/free-people-under-100-gifts"">Free People</a> dress with a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-drop-waist-dresses"">drop waist</a> <em>and</em> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-bubble-skirts"">bubble skirt</a> (both trendy yet polarizing silhouettes), I was pleasantly surprised by how it looked on my body. The feature even styled me in the same shoes that the model is wearing.</p>

<p>And when she isn’t attending lavish soirees, SJP is opting for humble winter wardrobe staples. “My day-to-day, I’m in waffle-cotton Hanes <em>men’ s </em>leggings in white. And I’m in 20-year-old cashmere cardigans from J. Crew.”<br /><br />I’ll spare you the unflattering image of me wearing Hanes’ men’s leggings. But hey, thankfully I could try them virtually before assuming just because SJP loves them that they’d also look good on me, and wasting my time and money! But it was fun playing around with how more <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cardigan-sweaters"">practical cardigans</a> — as well as more elaborate styles, like gowns that I may never actually wear — looked like. <br /><br />“I just think people can have things on their body that they might never have had a chance to try,” Parker explains, adding: “It feels like it’s a nice way for people to have some more assurance and also a touch of fantasy.”<br /><br />So, if you’re needing some <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-2026-fashion-beauty-lookbook"">festive outfit inspo</a> and fantasy (from the comfort of your couch), consider it sorted.</p>

<p><em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4jx0Xgc_Pc"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Is This Thing On?</a> </em>may not seem like a movie where you’d find Grammy-award winner and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2021/04/10442765/andra-day-oscars-beauty-hair-makeup-nails"">Oscar nominee Andra Day</a>. It’s about a white man doing stand-up comedy after all. But the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bradley-cooper"">Bradley Cooper</a>-directed divorce dramedy starring <a href=""https://www.theglobeandmail.com/culture/film-and-tv/film/article-stand-up-guy-bradley-cooper-gives-will-arnett-the-role-of-a-lifetime/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Will Arnett</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/05/153024/laura-dern-interview-daughter-jaya"">Laura Dern</a> wouldn’t be complete without Day, who brings some brutal honesty and a delightful groundedness to the film. She plays Christine, the best friend to Dern’s Tess, and the wife of Cooper’s Balls (yes, that’s really his character’s name). Tess is going through a divorce with Arnett’s Alex, who turns to stand-up comedy to cope with their breakup. Day is so good as Christine in every scene, it feels like you’re eavesdropping on old friends who can’t help but tell each other the truth — no matter how uncomfortable. </p>



<p>Cooper handpicked Day for the role and was sure she’d say no. “I was just crossing my fingers with Andra,” Cooper says in the <a href=""https://press.searchlightpictures.com/is-this-thing-on"">film’s production notes</a>. “I just knew she would say no, but I had to offer it to her. When I saw<em> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/02/10332763/is-united-states-vs-billie-holiday-drugs-arrests-death-accurate"">The United States vs. Billie Holliday</a>,</em> I was floored. I was like, ‘Look, I apologize that the real estate is going to be small here, but here is the terrain. Would you please come do this with me?’ It was a huge coup to get her.” And with the small real estate Day is given, she builds a brick house. It’s a no-bullshit performance that leaps off the screen, leaving the audience wanting more of Christine. And the dynamic between her and Tess “makes for a delicious, spiky friendship,” Dern says. </p>



<p>Here, Day talks about Cooper’s support, building rapport with Dern, singing with <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/seanhayes/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sean Hayes</a>, and why she’d never get back together with an ex.</p>



<p><strong><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/unbothered"">Refinery29 Unbothered</a>: I loved the film and was surprised by how much I was moved by it! I know that Bradley Cooper said he had to convince you, or that when he asked you to do this, he didn’t think you would say yes. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Andra Day:</strong> Is this what he’s telling people?<em> [laughs]</em> He did not have to convince me of anything! He just popped on the screen and he was Bradley Cooper and I was like, “great idea, let’s work together!” He’s so funny. I genuinely was very excited to be a part of [this movie]. I’m a huge fan of his work as an actor. I’m a huge fan of his work as a director. I just think he’s just shown he’s just such a brilliant director. He’s just a great filmmaker. So I was excited. I was like, “I’m actually looking forward to being in your hands and seeing what you put together with this cast.” I’m so glad you love the movie. And maybe I’m biased, but I love the movie too.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>I love the themes of truth, of rediscovery, of transformation, and communication, and just growth… We always talk about growth, but we never allow each other to change. I love that the movie dealt with all of those themes. </p><cite>andra day</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>Tell me more about why you chose to take on this role</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>I was really moved by [Bradley Cooper’s] support. I also knew that he was really supportive of two other movies I had done. So for him to back up that support with the offer to play this character, I thought was really, really special. And then he starts describing the movie to me. It’s <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/is-this-thing-on-review-will-arnett-laura-dern-1236397884/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Will Arnett’s baby</a>, and they’ve been friends for such a long time. So I love that it was he [cast] himself as [the character] Balls, because who else better to play Will’s best friend than his actual best friend? I love the dynamic of the friend group. I love the themes of truth, of rediscovery, of transformation, and communication, and just growth. I think it’s so funny. We always talk about growth, but we never allow each other to change. So I love that the movie dealt with all of those themes. And then Bradley mentioned the names Will Arnett, Laura Dern and Sean Hayes. And I was like, <em>this is all just getting too crazy. </em>They are all just so great. It was a dream cast to work with and it was exactly what I thought it would be. And better.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11950917.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=625&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A625"" /><figcaption>From L to R: Bradley Cooper, Will Arnett, and Andra Day in IS THIS THING ON?

<p><strong>I love what you just said: “we always talk about growth, but we don’t allow each other to change.” That was a bar! </strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>You know, maybe I was a little rapper in my past life<em> [laughs].</em> Nah, I’m just kidding but I think it’s true! </p>



<p><strong>I want to talk about that cast that you mentioned, because there are some heavy hitters. You play Laura Dern’s best friend, Christine. Talk about building that rapport with Laura Dern, because it does feel like you’re just dropped into this years-long friendship. How did you build that rapport?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>It’s amazing to feel like you were just dropped in this relationship. I think that’s a testament to the great writing, the great direction and how it was shot, but also the truth.  Bradley absolutely requires truth. That’s the thing we’re looking for. But working with Laura, first of all, I’m just such a huge fan of her work. Laura plays such an array of characters, and so, of course, you walk into her space and you’re intimidated at first. You got to make sure you show up and support and you’re present but beyond that, being able to work with Laura and discovering,<em> oh, wow, she is amazing. </em>She’s great at what she does, and a huge part of that is how generous she is on set, how generous she is with not just the director and her co stars, but everyone on set, every actor, personnel on set and and how honest and open she is about herself as a human, and how much of that she brings to the character. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11950918.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>Laura Dern and Andra Day in IS THIS THING ON?

<p><strong>Christine is such a protective friend.</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>I love that you see that! <em>[laughs] </em></p>



<p><strong>She’s like, don’t mess with my girl! How protective of a friend are you? Could you relate to that in Christine?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD:</strong> No, I have ADHD, so I can’t focus on shit. Most of the time I don’t even remember. <em>[laughs] </em>I’m just kidding! No,I think I am a protective friend.<em> [gestures off camera]. </em>Look, I have a friend in the room that’s nodding her head “yes” and laughing right now.</p>



<p>I think I am definitely a protective friend, for sure. What I like about Christine, though, is that she is a protective friend, but she will also protect you from yourself. I think that what I love about her character is her brutal honesty. I think what makes it so not just digestible, but actually endearing, is the fact that she is equally as brutally honest with herself. That’s really the only way to be honest with someone, that’s the only way they can actually trust your advice or your critique, if that they know that you hold yourself to that same standard. I think we’re similar in that way. I can be very protective, and not just physically, but also emotionally when it comes to friends and people that I love.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Bradley [said] the names Will Arnett, Laura Dern and Sean Hayes. I was like, <em>this is all just getting too crazy. </em>It was a dream cast to work with. It was exactly what I thought it would be. And better.</p><cite>andra day</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>Stand-up comedy is the beating heart throughout this film. Is stand-up something you’ve ever thought about doing? Did this movie change your opinion of it at all? </strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>Stand-up comedy is never something I ever thought about doing, and still have never thought about doing because it looks terrifying to me. You know what’s funny, I was saying  about the movie that it makes me laugh when we describe <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq50ze1xn0zo"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">John Bishop</a> [who inspired] Will Arnett’s character, Alex Novak, and they’re like, “Yeah, he just kind of did this stand-up because he didn’t want to pay the cover.” And I’m like, “guys, that’s not normal.” <em>[laughs]. </em>Like, if it were me, and someone was like, you can either pay the cover or you can go do stand up. I’m either coming out of my pocket 15 bucks or I’m going to the restaurant down the street. I’m not going to do a set of stand-up for $15!  It’s too terrifying. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11950919.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>Will Arnett with director Bradley Cooper on the set of IS THIS THING ON? Photo by Searchlight Pictures/Jason McDonald, Courtesy of Searchlight Pictures. © 2025 Searchlight Pictures All Rights Reserved.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I think it takes something inherently in you to do that. But what I learned was about the community of stand-up. I think it’s an incredible community. Bradley [Cooper] has always loved stand-up. And I think we all have, right? The Richard Pryors, Eddie Murphys. But the connectedness and the camaraderie were amazing to me. It used to be a lot more competitive. Now, when you dip into the culture, you realize that they’re doing, like, 3 to 6, clubs<em> a night,</em> which is insane. The grind is such that I’ve always admired stand-up comics, I loved to see how connected they are. And I think that Bradley [Cooper] and Will [Arnett] did an incredible job of showing this community, how they support each other, how they joke, and how honest they are as people.</p>



<p><strong>There’s this incredible scene where you and Sean Hayes sing “Amazing Grace.” How did that come to be?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>First, I love singing with Sean. I love Sean’s voice. Twas an amazing scene to shoot. It was amazing because it wasn’t written in the script. The night before, I got a call from Bradley that was like, “What do you think about singing ‘Amazing Grace’?” I was like, “Sure!” That was one of the later scenes we shot and I was, I was used to us being on set and being able to pivot. Who knows if it would be amazing or if it’d be really cringe and weird? I didn’t know. But it worked.</p>



<p>That scene, for me, and a lot of the Oyster Bay scenes, helped me to feel much more a part of this group. It just felt like we just were enjoying each other’s presence while we were on set filming that scene. And then I think it translated for the audience — them singing Amazing Grace added like, 10 or 15 years to their friendship. </p>



<p><strong>We’re going to end on a little game. I’m going to give you scenarios — based on the movie — and the answers are either “Bothered or Unbothered.” Your partner decides to become a stand up comedian later in life, bothered or unbothered? </strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>Unbothered! I’m an artist in that way. I’m just kind of like, “you’re fine. Try it if you love it!”</p>



<p><strong>You don’t like your best friend’s husband: bothered or unbothered?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>Super bothered! Super duper bothered! </p>



<p><strong>Telling your best friend’s man you used to have a crush on him.</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>Oohh. This is where I differ from my character. I’m a little more bothered about that.</p>



<p><strong>Getting back together with an ex.</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>Bothered, bothered, bothered! You an ex for a reason.</p>



<p><strong>Your friend doesn’t tell you she got back together with her ex. Bothered or unbothered?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>Bothered. Not because you got back with your ex — unless he’s a toxic ex — I’m like, sis, what are we doing? Bothered, because if he’s a decent person, then what am I doing that made you feel uncomfortable to talk to me about that? If we’re best friends and I’m a confidant, then I’m bothered a little bit with myself and the situation.</p>



<p><strong>When people announce their breakup on social media or publicly.</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>I don’t care. Unbothered. I’m like, do you! Who cares?</p>



<p><strong>Finally, using your personal life as fodder for art or comedy, bothered or unbothered?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>Unbothered, that’s actually art and comedy. I’m bothered when you don’t use it at all. You know what I’m saying? That’s when I’m bothered.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11950003.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>Highly detailed “Supermoon” Pink Moon image with a star field background</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In true form, the New Moon in Sagittarius <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/weekly-horoscopes-december-14-to-20-meaning-effects"">on December 19th</a> is going to be a wild roller coaster of emotions. It’s officially the last new moon of 2025 and it’s going to bring high energy and a truly uplifting lunar reset.</p>



<p>But just when we thought we had escaped confusing and ambiguous times brought on by a season of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">five planetary retrogrades</a>, the New Moon in Sagittarius arrives and shakes up our emotions and relationships — once again. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-sagittarius-november-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Venus in Sagittarius</a>, Saturn in Pisces, and Neptune in Pisces aspect the New Moon, creating a mixed bag of emotions. Venus’ alignment gives us hope to enhance our love lives, while Saturn limits and Neptune heightens our fantasies — so, we may feel as though we are <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/women-situationship-relationship-dating-lessons"">stuck in a situationship</a> that’s holding us back, but have faith that things will get better soon. Add in a minor frustration from Jupiter retrograde in Cancer and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uranus-retrograde-gemini-taurus-september-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Uranus retrograde in Taurus</a>, and the vibe gets both saucy and sassy. </p>



<p>As a result, our intuition will prove to be powerful. It’ll be easier than ever for us to comprehend matters on a spiritual level. The flip side is that we might also be paranoid or delulu in certain matters. Finding a balance between embracing our instincts and logic is pivotal to ensure we don’t go overboard in one direction over another. It’ll be challenging to remain centered, which is why grounding exercises such as connecting to the body through yoga or a walk in nature will do us good. This activity will clear our minds and remind us to remain present — no matter what the universe throws our way.</p>



<p>The need for change is strong, as we yearn to evolve in our love lives. The lessons Saturn imparts on us are going to rock our worlds for the better. The fog brought on by Neptune might hold us captive, but it will dissipate soon. Trusting our hearts and others unthinkingly can lead us to question what we want and whether we are making the best choices, but we’ll see that our innate divine wisdom and knowledge hold the key to our happiness. Ignoring outside noise and opinions of others helps guide us to the right space and place. Venus and the New Moon push us to roll the dice and bet on our feelings. We have to “know when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em.”</p>



<p>The following day, Mercury in Sagittarius squares the Nodes of Destiny on the Pisces and Virgo lunar axis. It’ll be hard to find the best way to move forward without drama or arguments, since we are bewildered about what the best path is. The mutable T-Square is causing our nerves to heighten. Our anxieties might reach a fever pitch as we continue to ruminate over the avenue we wish to pursue. Before getting into a headspin and over matters, take a step back and contemplate through meditation. If we are lucky, the universe will grant us both clarity and self-discovery.</p>



<p>In moments like this, it’s always great to reflect and take stock of our desires and progress. The Temperance tarot card (which aligns with the sun sign Sagittarius) represents this sentiment, since it focuses on how we can find our calm in turbulent times. Patience ignites the dream to come alive. Therefore, we shouldn’t make impetuous decisions. Moderation is essential to finding our deepest feelings, motives, and passions. Even though we are caught in the middle of the storm, we can navigate it. The only way out is through — we won’t realize it immediately, but we are in the driver’s seat. Let your senses and heart be the map that you listen to.</p>
