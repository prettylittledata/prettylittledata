<h4><em>WCAG color contrast is more than just text</em></h4><p>Most designers know the basics of web accessibility and color contrast. We’ve memorized that “normal text” (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html#dfn-large-scale"">24 CSS pixels and below</a>) needs to meet a 4.5:1 contrast ratio with its background, and “large text” (greater than 24 CSS pixels) needs to meet a 3:1 ratio.</p><p><strong>But WCAG (</strong><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/""><strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</strong></a><strong>) color contrast requirements don’t stop at text.</strong> There are lesser known WCAG success criteria (or “rules”) that are still very important for inclusive design; these ensure interfaces are usable to users with low vision or color blindness.</p><figure><img alt=""Viewing YouTube’s homepage with different vision simulations, like red-green color blindness and sun-glare"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-l5gevfqLDE88Ha5TisA6g.png"" /><figcaption>Viewing YouTube’s homepage with different vision simulations, like red-green color blindness</figcaption></figure><p>Some of these forgotten requirements circle around UI components, inline links, and data visualizations, which all have color contrast rules of their own. When these details are overlooked, users can’t tell what’s interactive, what’s linked, or what the data is actually saying (even if all the text uses accessible colors).</p><p>And these accessibility gaps aren’t edge cases. They show up in mature Design Systems, enterprise products, and well-intentioned designs because they live outside the accessibility standards designers tend to learn and adopt.</p><p>To avoid these gaps for the future, let’s go over 3 ongoing color contrast issues, how WCAG applies beyond text, and who exactly is impacted by color contrast.</p><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: I reference WCAG 2.1, Level AA standards. If your product needs to comply with Level AAA, required color contrast ratios increase (i.e., </em><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-enhanced.html""><em>normal text needs a 7:1 ratio</em></a><em> with its background).</em></blockquote><h3>UI components that look accessible (but aren’t)</h3><p>WCAG criteria: <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html"">SC 1.4.11: Non-Text Contrast (Level AA)</a></p><p>In plain english, this WCAG criteria requires that non-text UI elements that are interactive or communicate meaning have a <strong>minimum of 3:1 contrast ratio</strong> against adjacent colors (like the UI background).</p><p>But what is covered by “UI elements”? Basically, anything that a user can interact with or needs to see to use; such as:</p><ul><li>Buttons and button states</li><li>Form fields and their borders</li><li>Checkboxes, radio buttons, and toggles</li><li>Focus indicators</li><li>Icons that convey meaning or affordance</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Spirit includes text fields that do not meet contrast requirements with a 1.6:1 ratio"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mzlbjZWOHK27EOSS3N1QaQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.spirit.com/flight-status""><em>Spirit</em></a><em> includes text fields that do not meet contrast requirements with a 1.6:1 ratio; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong>Important note</strong><em>: If color contrast fails WCAG standards from the Design System level, the failure is replicated across all product adopters; it’s critical to check system UI component’s color contrast.</em></blockquote><h4>What designers miss and why it matters</h4><p>This is where many designs that are intended to be accessible quietly fail. Since these UI elements don’t contain text, they’re excluded from color contrast checks. And yes, text is very important to check, but so are the UI elements that provide any product its functionality.</p><p><strong>Common gaps within UI elements include:</strong></p><ul><li>Input borders that blend into the product background</li><li>Custom focus indicators that rely on subtle color shifts instead of high-contrast</li><li>Icon-only controls (like buttons) that don’t meet contrast on their own</li></ul><p><strong>When UI elements lack minimum contrast, users can’t reliably:</strong></p><ul><li>Identify what’s interactive or understand UI component states (like hover)</li><li>Navigate interfaces using only their keyboard</li><li>Complete forms without repetitive errors</li></ul><figure><img alt=""BBC includes a primary CTA that meets contrast requirements with a 4.58:1 ratio"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9lBpa8t8UhfH8HfsgOkvOQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.bbc.com/""><em>BBC</em></a><em> includes a primary CTA that meets contrast requirements with a 4.58:1 ratio; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><h4>Who are the users impacted?</h4><p>Though low-contrast UI elements affect everyone at some capacity (you might have to do some squinting), they make products unusable to people like:</p><ul><li>Users with low vision who need distinct visual styling</li><li>Keyboard users who depend on focus indicators that stand-out on the UI</li><li>Older users experiencing reduced contrast sensitivity</li><li>Users in low-contrast environments (i.e., sun-glare, small screens, fluorescent lights)</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: To check a UI component’s contrast (or any element that needs contrast), you can also use </em><a href=""https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-disability-simulator/olioanlbgbpmdlgjnnampnnlohigkjla?hl=en&amp;pli=1""><em>Web Disability Simulator</em></a><em> on any web page to simulate how it looks for users with color-blindness or cognitive disabilities.</em></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Red-green color blind simulation on YouTube with the Web Disability Simulator Chrome extension"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QWZyIWC5rf7neuUBx-RhKQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Red-green color blind simulation on </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/""><em>YouTube</em></a><em> with the </em><a href=""https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-disability-simulator/olioanlbgbpmdlgjnnampnnlohigkjla?hl=en&amp;pli=1""><em>Web Disability Simulator</em></a><em> Chrome extension</em></figcaption></figure><h3>Data visualizations with low contrast</h3><p>WCAG criteria: <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html"">SC 1.4.11: Non-Text Contrast (Level AA)</a></p><p>This accessibility gap references the same WCAG standard as UI components from above. But though data visualizations (data viz) may not always be interactive, they’re communicating meaningful information. Because of this, data viz must be perceivable without relying only on color and must meet a <strong>minimum 3:1 contrast ratio</strong> against adjacent colors.</p><p>This standard applies to:</p><ul><li>Chart lines, bars, and segments</li><li>Data points and markers</li><li>Axes, gridlines, or any reference lines that convey meaning</li><li>Legends or other visual keys</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Datylon includes a pie chart example that does not meet contrast requirements with a 1:1 ratio"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1OTh5HfA1C-vKeF7ZsJWag.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.datylon.com/resources/chart-library/pie-chart""><em>Datylon</em></a><em> includes a pie chart example that does not meet contrast requirements with a 1:1 ratio; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><h4>What designers miss and why it matters</h4><p>Data viz is an already complex and complicated UI element, so it’s even more difficult to bake in accessibility guidelines (especially if it’s being retrofitted). But color contrast issues are frequently found in charts and heatmaps that use the brand’s color palette rather than accessibility-tested colors.</p><p><strong>Common issues with data viz include:</strong></p><ul><li>Chart colors that are distinguishable in isolation but fail 3:1 contrast when touching one another</li><li>Data series using colors that aren’t distinguishable for color-blind users (i.e., red-green)</li><li>Thin gridlines with low contrast that disappear against the background</li><li>Charts that use multiple colors without secondary text indicators</li><li>Legends that depend on matching colors instead of labels or patterns</li></ul><p><strong>When data viz lack contrast and use color alone, users can’t:</strong></p><ul><li>Clearly and quickly understand trends in the data set</li><li>Confidently compare data without the feeling of guessing</li><li>Lose access to critical insights (especially when the data isn’t provided in another way)</li></ul><h4>Who are the users impacted?</h4><p>Again, all users are affected on some level by low contrast data viz. But other users need to be considered when designing the different types of charts so they can perceive and comprehend the same information as everyone else.</p><p>Some of these users include:</p><ul><li>Color-blind users (especially those with red-green color blindness)</li><li>Users with low vision who need high contrast for visual distinction</li><li>Users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from redundant cues</li><li>Users viewing charts on small screens or in poor lighting</li></ul><figure><img alt=""IBM Carbon includes a pie chart example that meets contrast requirements with a 7.76:1 ratio"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_Gsff7Yx_6gvh6DmjX7Djg.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://carbondesignsystem.com/data-visualization/simple-charts/#pie""><em>IBM Carbon</em></a><em> includes a pie chart example that meets contrast requirements with a 7.76:1 ratio; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: Simply by adding a white border between data viz elements, the colors become more distinguishable and meet accessibility guidelines.</em></blockquote><h3>Inline links that rely on low contrast color</h3><p>WCAG criteria: <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color.html"">SC 1.4.1: Use of Color (Level A)</a></p><p>Color cannot be the only visual means used to indicate a link on a web page. But not only that, inline links also must have <strong>at least 3:1 contrast</strong> against surrounding body text to be distinguishable (especially when the link doesn’t have an additional visual cue, <a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/F73.html"">like an underline or bold font weight</a>).</p><figure><img alt=""Atlanta’s Department of Transportation includes inline links that do not meet contrast requirements with a 1.58:1 ratio"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*k_84e7wKBM0IOAXis1ljeA.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://atldot.atlantaga.gov/""><em>Atlanta’s Department of Transportation</em></a><em> includes inline links that do not meet contrast requirements with a 1.58:1 ratio; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><h4>What designers miss and why it matters</h4><p>Inline links are such simple and subtle UI components; it’s easy to miss the checks needed to ensure accessibility. Designers typically think that since a paragraph of text meets the 4.5:1 color ratio requirement, any inline link using the same text color within the paragraph also passes. Since links are interactive elements, they have additional guidelines other than passing the color requirements for text.</p><p><strong>Frequent issues with inline links include:</strong></p><ul><li>Links that are differentiated only by an underline when the link receive mouse hover or keyboard focus</li><li>Link colors that meet contrast against the background, but not against adjacent text</li><li>Underlines removed for aesthetic or simplicity reasons</li></ul><p><strong>When inline links aren’t clearly distinguishable, users can’t:</strong></p><ul><li>Easily comprehend what’s interactive (especially when hidden in body copy)</li><li>Efficiently navigate a website or product page</li><li>Find important actions or information they need to complete a task</li></ul><h4>Who are the users impacted?</h4><p>I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again… this affects all users at some capacity. Inline links are not as recognizable to any user when the underline affordance or high contrast color is taken away. But for some users, it becomes impossible to identify links that could lead the user to information or product pages they need.</p><p>Users to consider when designing inline links include:</p><ul><li>Color-blind users who may not perceive color differences</li><li>Users with low vision who require visual affordances with high contrast</li><li>Users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from consistent patterns</li><li>All users scanning content quickly</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: A simple rule of thumb is to make a link look like a link for optimal usability and accessibility.</em></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Gov.UK includes inline links that meets contrast requirements with a 3.81:1 ratio AND are underlined"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3rOPtaAXaJBwGlfl3wKXcg.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid""><em>Gov.UK</em></a><em> includes inline links that meets contrast requirements with a 3.81:1 ratio AND are underlined; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>UI components, inline links, and data visualizations often fall outside the mental checklist of color contrast and accessible design.</strong> WCAG covers these elements, but it’s often overlooked when focusing on adequate contrast for text. This leads to websites and interfaces that look high contrast, but are near impossible to use for some user groups.</p><p>By spreading awareness to these accessibility gaps, we can expand how we define color contrast and better apply ideal accessibility practices. When these requirements are built into components, patterns, and Design Systems from the start, accessibility stops being a last-minute fix (or remediation plan) and becomes part of the design process.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=68cc224735b3"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/3-color-contrast-mistakes-designers-still-make-68cc224735b3"">3 color contrast mistakes designers still make</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Our brain is a prediction machine that can’t be stopped. No matter how hard we try, it will still build expectations.</h4><p>If you’re reading this, you’ve probably asked yourself the same question I always have: What exactly makes users subconsciously follow <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279871278_Color-in-Context_Theory"">Color Psychology</a>, <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles?srsltid=AfmBOopi3ws2HhTLq5t9k-4j8DcE9Ef_W6XddNvGAqidJSuDQZDW4XU4"">Gestalt principles</a>, and behavioral patterns like <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/hicks-law/"">Hick’s law</a>? Why does all of this work? Is there a way to understand the true nature of our brain and not just how it reacts, but why it predicts, expects, and perceives the world the way it does?</p><p>Now it’s time to go one level deeper — into the core of how our brain actually works. In this article, we’ll touch on one of the fundamental theories that helps me personally answer these questions, and I would love to share it with you. Buckle up, we’re shifting into nerd gear!</p><h3>The Free Energy Principle</h3><p>In 2010, in his paper <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2787"">The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_J._Friston"">Karl Friston</a> formally introduced a theory stating that every system, including living organisms, strives to minimize free energy. Simple enough: we don’t like surprises. But let’s take a closer look at what that really means.</p><figure><img alt=""Portrait of neuroscientist Karl Friston, author of the Free Energy Principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*SSE0hdbj4PtpTqh7.jpg"" /><figcaption>Karl Friston, Photo by Kate Peters (<a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/karl-friston-free-energy-principle-artificial-intelligence/"">WIRED</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The brain’s main task is to minimize the gap between expectation and reality. This gap is what the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle"">Free Energy Principle</a> defines as free energy. When the brain encounters unpredictable input, its stress level rises. And it’s crucial to understand: this isn’t about you as a person or a “user”, it’s about your brain. It’s not something we consciously control, but it’s something we can use.</p><p>After all, as humans, we don’t always chase predictability or comfort. Many people enjoy physical exercise, even though it’s technically stress for the muscles. We love movies with unexpected plot twists, and even comedy works by placing us in a familiar setup and then adding an unpredictable punchline.</p><p>That’s because we’re more than just our brains. The human organism and our consciousness is a complex system of subsystems, including our hormonal system, which can reward the brain with the right chemistry under stress, or reinforce behavior when we act in line with its internal “program.”</p><p>So, the Free Energy Principle is actually quite a complex theory, and there are different mathematical interpretations of it. But for simplicity and convenience, today we’re going to look at a more accessible formula:</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram of the free energy equation with each variable labeled."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OltXx93fAkWg9_8i2HvACw.png"" /></figure><p>We can break it down into several key variables:</p><ul><li><strong><em>F</em> </strong>— variational free energy: this is the result of our brain’s calculations. For the brain (or any predictive system) to remain in a stable, low-stress state, F should approach zero. The higher the free energy, the greater the stress or uncertainty in the system. This idea directly connects to the concept of entropy, the natural tendency toward disorder which both we and our brains constantly try to resist.</li><li><strong><em>s</em></strong> — sensory input: everything we receive from the external world — sounds, tactile sensations, visual images, etc.</li><li><strong><em>m</em></strong> — internal model: our internal representation of how the world works. Essentially, our expectations about external reality or specific aspects of it.</li><li><strong><em>P</em></strong><em> </em>— probability: represents the likelihood of a certain sensory input given our internal model (it’s defined by what’s in the parentheses but not part of the main operation). The result ranges from 0 to 1, since it’s a probability.</li><li><strong>−ln</strong> — natural logarithm: this function converts probabilities (values between 0 and 1) into a scale from 0 to infinity, making the difference between expectation and reality mathematically measurable but not limited.</li></ul><p>The higher the probability, the smaller the resulting value. In other words, our brain is “happy” when the probability of our expectations matching what we actually perceive equals 1 (maximum probability) — in that case, F=0. The lower the probability (P), the greater the amount of free energy (F): 1 = 0; 0.5 = 0.69; 0.1 = 2.3; 0.01 = 4.6.</p><p>Let’s look at an example. A user moves the cursor over something that looks like a button: text on a bright blue rectangle.</p><figure><img alt=""Interface example of a button with active cursor"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*idKF4TdvSkphrORSln-aGg.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p>m — the user expects that the button will somehow change its state, what we usually call a hover state.</p><p>s — nothing happens to the button itself, but the cursor changes.</p><p>Technically, the user’s expectations were violated. But since our internal models are more complex than a single visual reaction, the additional input (the cursor change) helped complete the picture. When the button eventually responds to a click, the user almost immediately forgets the odd interaction.</p><p>Their P might have dropped slightly, perhaps to 0.95, meaning the probability that their mental model still matches the incoming input remains very high. The amount of free energy is close to zero. The brain is calm, the user is satisfied, the product is sold.</p><p>Now let’s take a negative example. The user moves the cursor over the same button: the same text, the same blue rectangle. The user once again expects that clicking it will initiate a purchase, that’s our m (the internal model).</p><p>But the response is nothing: no color change, no cursor change, not even an error message. The user clicks repeatedly. Their P (probability) that their mental model matches the actual input, drops close to zero.</p><figure><img alt=""Interface example of a button with no hover feedback."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SN8vFhrI6J4EoE0zb1jFCA.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p>The brain starts trying to reduce the growing amount of free energy, sending out emotional signals. In this case, the button, the site, the entire interaction become irritants. Almost unconsciously, the user begins performing a series of random actions, trying to fix the problem.</p><p>And if we’re lucky, they eventually scroll up and notice that the email field is outlined in red with a message saying it’s required. They enter the email, click Buy again, and finally succeed.</p><p>Not as happy, but at least with a product on the way. All of this happened simply because the button had no disabled state, no visual communication that it couldn’t yet be pressed, forcing the user to waste five tense seconds clicking into nothing.</p><p>This is a fairly simple example that directly illustrates the relationship between our expectations and our perception of reality. But there are many others that you, as designers, already know well.</p><p>Take the Gestalt principles, for instance. We don’t just see a random collection of shapes but we instinctively try to group them and assign meaning. It’s something our brain does automatically, without conscious effort. That’s exactly why, at the beginning of this section, I emphasized that this principle isn’t about us as individuals. It’s about our brain itself.</p><p>Our brain constantly relies on its internal model, comparing it with the incoming sensory input we receive. And when the amount of free energy becomes too high, the brain automatically tries to fix the problem.</p><p>It starts to create new categories or groups, sending the necessary emotional signals to push us toward resolving the discrepancy. Sometimes, it adjusts the internal model itself, modifying m in the formula to reduce the gap between expectation and reality. That’s actually how we learn something new and this, in fact, can explain the very nature of our neuroplasticity.</p><p>But the brain can also go the other way distorting perception, effectively altering s in the formula, the sensory input itself. And that’s where we enter the territory of cognitive biases and perceptual illusions, an entire field in itself, and one that truly deserves the attention of us designers.</p><h3>Abduction is the key to humanity</h3><p>I’m confident in saying that almost every well-known principle we are using in design can ultimately be explained through the Free Energy Principle. But that doesn’t mean we, as designers, need to consciously apply it in our daily work. Good and even excellent designers usually operate within the beginner and intermediate levels of design psychology, and that’s more than enough to create meaningful, functional products.</p><p>For me personally, it has always been and still is fascinating to understand why things, principles, and rules work the way they do. That’s why I try to find explanations and new perspectives through different sciences. And psychology is one of them.</p><p>With this article, I’d like to invite you to look at the familiar design dogmas we follow from a slightly different angle and to try broadening our perspective.</p><p>In a world where AI already knows all these rules and can even create interfaces based on them, what may soon remain truly ours is our human curiosity, the desire to reach for truth, to question what we take for granted, and to look at problems from new angles, expanding the boundaries of any given task.</p><p>In the language of philosophy, specifically the branch of logic we, as humans and users, most often rely on deduction and induction.</p><p>Deduction is deriving consequences from established rules. When we build our hypotheses based on principles and patterns. All clickable elements should change their state on hover → This button changes its state on hover → Therefore, this button is a clickable element.</p><p>Induction is generalizing from experience. When we conduct direct user testing. Our user clicked 100 different buttons, and each time the button changed its state on hover → The user now expects that all buttons should change their state when hovered over.</p><p>But we, as designers, are expected to bring new ideas into the world.</p><p>So I’d like to invite you to look at another type of reasoning — abduction. It is the process of forming a hypothesis that could best explain an observation.</p><figure><img alt=""Triangular diagram showing the relation between abduction, deduction and induction with text descriptions."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/850/1*cLJYu98iQ0ogbr6iNisEuw.png"" /><figcaption>The relation between abduction, deduction and induction. <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Fig-A1-The-relation-between-abduction-deduction-and-induction-Several-alternative_fig1_48326326"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>We notice that users often close the payment page without clicking the button → What if the problem isn’t the button’s state but the emotional context — the anxiety or distrust triggered by the act of payment? → Let’s change “Pay” to “Secure Payment” and add the logos of trusted payment providers below the button to increase confidence.</p><blockquote>Abduction is the process of forming explanatory hypotheses. It is the only logical operation which introduces any new idea.<br /><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce""><em>Charles S. Peirce</em></a><em> in </em><a href=""https://isidore.co/misc/Res%20pro%20Deo/Peirce/Done/5.html""><em>Collected Papers, CP 5.172</em></a></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Portrait of philosopher Charles S. Peirce, associated with the concept of abduction."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*7FcbdkzlQAL20VNs.png"" /><figcaption>Charles Sanders Peirce. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce#/media/File:Charles_Sanders_Peirce.png"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>You could even say that by using abduction, we ourselves become prediction machines: the feeling of anticipation, building a hypothesis, is what has made us human for thousands of years. It’s how we were able to achieve such heights of science and technology out of nothing.</p><p>And this ability appeared in us precisely because our brain tries to get rid of free energy. That’s why I believe this principle is important not only to try to explain user behavior, but it is fundamental for us, as creators, thinkers, and engineers.</p><h3>Final thoughts</h3><p>And as for the practical application of today’s topic, I suggest you the following approach as an experiment just for yourself: if you’re facing a tough problem or one you’ve solved a hundred times, try ignoring all design principles for a moment. Approach it as if you only had abduction to generate hypotheses and the Free Energy Principle to evaluate them.</p><p>Take a specific user and the situation they’re in, then sketch several alternative solutions you can score with the formula F = −ln P(s∣m).</p><p>Fill in the variables: m (what the user expected) and s (what the user actually saw). Then estimate which solution “minimizes free energy”, meaning yields the highest probability that perception will match expectation. And that’s your leading candidate.</p><p>And remember, psychology gives us the lens, design provides the tools, but the final verdict always belongs to the human being whose subjective perception can overturn any formula. That’s why theory is only valuable as long as it remains flexible, ready to yield to real observation, to the living unpredictable experience of the people we design for.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=0e557d122b81"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/lower-the-surprise-applying-the-free-energy-principle-to-ux-0e557d122b81"">Lower the surprise: Applying The free energy principle to UX</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4><strong>What product designers can learn from how they design intelligence flows.</strong></h4><p>Everyone thinks Perplexity and NotebookLM succeed because they use “better AI.”</p><p>They don’t. <strong>They use the same models as everyone else.</strong></p><p>I spent three months deconstructing both — not just as a user, but as an architect. I mapped where intelligence lives, traced where humans direct and where AI executes.</p><p><strong>Here’s what they actually did differently.</strong></p><p><strong>The answer isn’t in the AI models. It’s in how they architect the flow of work between human and AI.</strong></p><p>This is what I call <strong>Intelligence Flow Architecture</strong> — the design of HOW cognitive work flows between human and artificial intelligence. Not what the AI can do, but how the collaboration is structured. Where does intelligence live? Who does what work? How do they hand off tasks?</p><p>This is a design discipline most product teams don’t know exists.</p><figure><img alt=""The essence of Intelligence Flow Architecture: Same models, different flows, completely different results.

Visualization created with Gemini AI.</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>What I mean by “architecture”:</strong> I’m not talking about software architecture (microservices, backend systems) or information architecture (navigation, content structure). I’m talking about <strong>architecting the “how”</strong> — the flow of cognitive work between human and AI. Who does what? Where does intelligence live? How do they collaborate? This is the discipline of designing intelligent systems, not just intelligent features.</p><p>Let me show you exactly how Perplexity and NotebookLM do it — and what you can apply to your own products.</p><h3>The architecture difference</h3><p>Here’s what people miss:</p><p>Both products run on the same foundation — large language models, vector embeddings, search APIs, retrieval-augmented generation.</p><p><strong>Same ingredients. Completely different results.</strong></p><p>Why? Because they architected different <strong>intelligence flows</strong> — different answers to these critical questions:</p><ul><li>WHERE does AI work autonomously?</li><li>WHERE does human provide direction?</li><li>HOW do they hand off work between them?</li><li>WHAT intelligence lives in which layer?</li></ul><blockquote><strong><em>In his </em></strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ""><strong><em>June 2025 keynote at Y Combinator</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Andrej Karpathy — former director of AI at Tesla and OpenAI co-founder — described this exact shift:</em></strong><em> </em>“LLMs aren’t just tools anymore. They’re becoming operating systems. The LLM is the CPU, the context window is the memory, and the real design work is architecting how this new computer orchestrates problem-solving.”</blockquote><p>That’s exactly what Perplexity and NotebookLM understood.</p><p><strong>Watch what happens:</strong></p><p>When you ask <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/"">Perplexity</a> a question, AI doesn’t give you search results to click. It searches, synthesizes, answers, and cites sources — all autonomously.</p><p><strong>Flow:</strong> You direct → AI discovers → You evaluate</p><p>When you upload documents to <a href=""https://notebooklm.google.com/"">NotebookLM</a>, AI doesn’t just “chat about your docs.” It analyzes, maps relationships, and generates insights — without waiting for instructions.</p><p><strong>Flow:</strong> You curate sources → AI orchestrates knowledge → You explore</p><p>These are different architectures of collaboration.</p><p>Let me deconstruct both — layer by layer.</p><h3>Perplexity’s intelligence flow architecture: Real-time discovery</h3><p>What makes Perplexity feel different from Google isn’t better search. It’s a different distribution of cognitive work.</p><h4><strong>THE DESIGN DECISIONS:</strong></h4><p>Someone architected this. Someone decided:</p><ul><li>AI executes search autonomously (you don’t click 10 tabs)</li><li>AI synthesizes while streaming (you don’t wait for batch results)</li><li>AI handles citations in real-time (you don’t copy-paste sources)</li><li>Human directs through conversation (you don’t fill search forms)</li></ul><p><strong>Cognitive split: ~20% Human (direction + evaluation) / 80% AI (discovery + synthesis)</strong></p><p><strong>What this feels like to you as a user:</strong></p><p>You ask a question. Seconds later, you’re reading a synthesized answer with sources — without opening ten browser tabs. It feels like the system “just knows” what you meant and found the answer for you.</p><p>That feeling isn’t magic. <strong>It’s architecture.</strong></p><p>The intelligence lives in the synthesis layer, orchestrating search and combining sources in real-time.</p><figure><img alt=""Perplexity’s 5-layer architecture showing the 20% human / 80% AI cognitive split.

Document understanding.</p><h4><strong>THE DESIGN DECISIONS:</strong></h4><p>Someone architected this. Someone decided:</p><ul><li>AI works only with YOUR documents (not the entire web)</li><li>AI builds knowledge graph invisibly (you experience results, not structure)</li><li>AI generates multiple formats from same knowledge base</li><li>Human curates sources and exploration direction</li></ul><p><strong>Cognitive split: ~30% Human (curation + direction) / 70% AI (analysis + orchestration)</strong></p><p><strong>What this feels like to you as a user:</strong></p><p>You upload research papers. Within seconds, the system “understands” them — not just text search, but conceptual understanding. It finds connections you hadn’t seen. It can explain your own documents back to you in different formats.</p><p>That feeling isn’t magic. <strong>It’s architecture.</strong></p><p>The intelligence lives in the knowledge processing layer, building invisible structure that enables multiple interaction modes.</p><figure><img alt=""NotebookLM’s 5-layer architecture showing the 30% human / 70% AI cognitive split.

Note Layer 4’s gradient — it’s collaborative, where human and AI work together in the interaction loop. </em>Visualization created with Gemini AI.</figcaption></figure><h4>The pattern they both reveal</h4><p>Both succeed because they architected intelligence flows with clear principles.</p><p>(If you look back at the hero infographic at the top, you’ll see the contrast: Traditional AI = features bolted onto existing UIs. Intelligence Flow Architecture = intelligence embedded in the system’s core.)</p><h4><strong>The four principles</strong></h4><h3>Principle 1: Design backward from autonomous execution</h3><p>Don’t start with: <em>“What interface should we show?”</em></p><p>Start with: <em>“What will the system DO autonomously?”</em></p><ul><li>Perplexity: Search + synthesize + cite</li><li>NotebookLM: Analyze + map + generate formats</li></ul><p>Then design everything else to enable that autonomy.</p><p>This inverts traditional software design. Traditional products started with the interface — buttons, menus, workflows — then built backend systems to support them. Intelligence-first architecture starts with autonomous execution and works backward.</p><blockquote><em>The shift is profound: from </em>“How will users accomplish this task?” to “What can the system accomplish autonomously?” <em>As </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_RjOhCkhvQ""><em>Satya Nadella</em></a><em> noted, we’re moving business logic from the application tier to the intelligence tier. The execution layer defines your system’s value — everything else exists to enable it.</em></blockquote><p>Without this inversion, you end up with “AI features” bolted onto traditional interfaces. The intelligence feels like an add-on because it IS an add-on. True intelligence-first architecture means intelligence is embedded as fundamental structure, not added as features.</p><h3>Principle 2: Embed intelligence in specific layers</h3><p>Don’t bolt AI on as features.</p><p>Architect where intelligence lives:</p><ul><li>Perplexity: Intelligence in synthesis layer</li><li>NotebookLM: Intelligence in knowledge processing layer</li></ul><p>The intelligence isn’t visible as “AI feature” — it’s structural.</p><p>The test for embedded intelligence: Can you remove the AI and still have a functional product? If yes, intelligence is bolted on. If no, it’s embedded.</p><p>Perplexity without its synthesis intelligence doesn’t exist — it’s not “Google with AI added,” it’s a fundamentally different architecture where intelligence IS the product. NotebookLM’s knowledge processing layer isn’t a feature you can toggle off; it’s the system’s foundation.</p><p>This architectural embedding happens in specific layers of your five-layer stack. Intelligence doesn’t float everywhere — it concentrates where transformation occurs. In Perplexity, that’s Layer 2 (synthesis orchestration). In NotebookLM, it’s Layer 2 (knowledge graph construction). Identify where YOUR system’s intelligence must live, then build everything to support that layer.</p><h3>Principle 3: Design clear human/AI boundaries</h3><p>Define precisely where AI works autonomously and where human provides direction:</p><ul><li>Perplexity: Human directs → AI discovers → Human evaluates</li><li>NotebookLM: Human curates → AI orchestrates → Human explores</li></ul><blockquote><strong><em>Think of this as creating control maps — the new journey maps for AI experiences.</em></strong><em> Instead of mapping what users do, you map who is in control (user, AI, or both) and when that control shifts. As </em><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/from-journey-maps-to-control-maps-17aac58b9dd9""><em>Rob Chappell</em></a><em> notes, </em>“The question is no longer ‘What is the user trying to do?’ The more relevant question is: ‘Who is in control at this moment, and how does that shift?’”</blockquote><p>This is the evolution from traditional user journeys to human-AI collaboration flows.</p><p><strong>This pattern is becoming so clear that in June 2025, Karpathy dedicated his Y Combinator keynote to it.</strong> He calls it “partial autonomy” — systems where AI generates and humans verify in a continuous loop.</p><p>The architectural insight: <strong>The fastest generation-verification loop wins. Not the most autonomous AI.</strong></p><p>That’s why <a href=""https://cursor.com/"">Cursor</a> (coding), Perplexity (search), and NotebookLM (research) are succeeding — they optimized the loop, not the autonomy.</p><h3>Principle 4: Optimize for cognitive distribution</h3><p>Not: “Can AI do this task?”</p><p>But: “SHOULD AI do this, or SHOULD human?”</p><ul><li><strong>Human strengths:</strong> Goal definition, judgment, creative direction, evaluation</li><li><strong>AI strengths:</strong> Discovery, synthesis, pattern recognition, execution</li></ul><p>Both products make this mapping explicit in their architecture.</p><p>This requires mapping cognitive strengths systematically. From your Hybrid Cognition Map: Humans excel at goal definition, context understanding, judgment calls, ambiguity resolution, ethical decisions, creative direction, and stakeholder intuition. AI excels at information retrieval, pattern recognition, rapid iteration, consistency, tedious execution, multi-source synthesis, and 24/7 availability.</p><p>The magic happens at the intersection — not human OR AI, but human AND AI working in complementary strengths. Perplexity distributes: human defines information need (judgment), AI discovers and synthesizes (execution). NotebookLM distributes: human curates sources (context), AI processes and orchestrates (synthesis).</p><p>Poor cognitive distribution creates friction. If you ask humans to do what AI does better (tedious data processing), or ask AI to do what humans do better (strategic judgment), the collaboration fails. Design explicitly for strengths, not just capabilities.</p><figure><img alt=""The complete framework: Four principles that define how Perplexity and NotebookLM architect human-AI collaboration.

List every step users do manually.</p><h4><strong>STEP 2: Identify cognitive work</strong></h4><p>For each step, ask:</p><ul><li>Is this discovery work? (AI strength)</li><li>Is this synthesis? (AI strength)</li><li>Is this judgment? (Human strength)</li><li>Is this goal-setting? (Human strength)</li></ul><h4><strong>STEP 3: Design the intelligence flow</strong></h4><p>Redistribute work:</p><ul><li>What should AI do autonomously?</li><li>Where does human direct?</li><li>What are the handoff points?</li></ul><h4><strong>STEP 4: Design backward from execution</strong></h4><ul><li>What will AI execute? (execution layer)</li><li>What intelligence enables that? (intelligence layer)</li><li>How do systems coordinate? (orchestration layer)</li><li>How does human express intention? (input layer)</li></ul><h4><strong>Example: Redesigning email with Intelligence Flow Architecture</strong></h4><p>Let’s make this concrete. Here’s how Intelligence Flow Architecture transforms a common workflow — email composition.</p><p>Traditional Gmail requires you to manually type, edit, format, and send — roughly 5 minutes of writing every word. Intelligence Flow Architecture redesigns this as a 6-layer collaboration where AI handles autonomous execution while you provide direction and judgment.</p><p>The result: 30 seconds instead of 5 minutes. Directing instead of writing.</p><figure><img alt=""Email workflow transformation: Traditional Gmail requires 5 minutes of manual writing.

Intelligence Flow Architecture reduces it to 30 seconds of AI-directed execution. </em>Visualization created with Gemini AI.</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>The transformation:</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Before:</strong> You spend time writing, formatting, editing</li><li><strong>After:</strong> You spend time on judgment and direction</li></ul><h4><strong>The architecture enables this:</strong></h4><ul><li>Intelligence Layer: Understands context, style, user’s past patterns</li><li>Execution Layer: Drafts email autonomously</li><li>Input Layer: Natural language intention (“decline politely”)</li></ul><p>That’s Intelligence Flow Architecture applied.</p><h3>Why not full autonomy? The Tesla lesson</h3><p>Before we dive into what this means for product teams, let’s address the obvious question: <strong>Why design for partial autonomy instead of full autonomous agents?</strong></p><p>In his June 2025 keynote, Karpathy shared a telling story from his five years building autonomous systems at Tesla:</p><p>In 2013, he took a perfect self-driving ride in a Waymo — zero interventions, flawless. He thought: “Self-driving is imminent.”</p><p><strong>That was 12 years ago.</strong> Even now, <a href=""https://waymo.com/"">Waymo vehicles</a> that appear driverless still require significant human teleoperation and oversight.</p><blockquote><strong><em>His warning applies directly to product design:</em></strong><em> When AI generates massive outputs — 10,000 lines of code, complete research reports, fully redesigned interfaces — you haven’t saved time if verification takes hours. </em>“When I see things like ‘oh 2025 is the year of agents,’ I get very concerned. This is the <strong>decade</strong> of agents.”</blockquote><blockquote><strong>“We have to keep the AI on the leash,”</strong> <em>Karpathy emphasized. Not because AI isn’t capable, but because </em><strong><em>verification speed determines actual productivity.</em></strong></blockquote><p>This is why Intelligence Flow Architecture prioritizes the generation-verification loop over full autonomy. The goal isn’t to remove humans from the loop. <strong>The goal is to make the loop spin as fast as possible.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Karpathy’s lesson from 12 years at Tesla: Fast generation-verification loops beat pursuing full autonomy.

Loop speed determines productivity, <em>not autonomy level. </em>Visualization created with Gemini AI.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>A note for designers:</strong> You might be thinking “I’m not a system architect. Can I actually apply this?” Yes. Intelligence Flow Architecture isn’t about backend engineering — it’s about design thinking applied to human-AI collaboration. Start small: Pick one workflow. Map where human directs vs where AI executes. That’s architecting intelligence flows. You’re already doing this thinking — now you have language for it.</p><h3>What this means for product teams</h3><p>Here’s what changes when you adopt Intelligence Flow Architecture:</p><h4><strong>BEFORE (AI Features):</strong></h4><ul><li>PM says: “Let’s add AI to this workflow”</li><li>Designer asks: “What should the AI button look like?”</li><li>Engineer builds: API call to GPT → show response</li><li>Result: Feature that feels bolted on</li></ul><h4><strong>AFTER (Intelligence Flow Architecture):</strong></h4><ul><li>PM asks: “What cognitive work should AI handle autonomously?”</li><li>Designer maps: Human direction → AI execution → Human evaluation</li><li>Engineer architects: Intelligence layer + orchestration layer + execution layer</li><li>Result: System that feels intelligent</li></ul><h3><strong>The pattern</strong></h3><p>Perplexity and NotebookLM didn’t ask “How do we add AI?”</p><p>They asked: “How do we architect collaboration between human and artificial intelligence?”</p><p>That’s the difference between an AI feature and an intelligent system.</p><p>That’s Intelligence Flow Architecture.</p><p>And that framework — deciding where intelligence lives, how work distributes, when systems execute autonomously — <strong>that’s intelligence-first architecture.</strong></p><p><strong>Same AI models.</strong><br /><strong>Different architecture.</strong><br /><strong>Completely different experience.</strong></p><p>Now you know why.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ace59eeda531"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/perplexity-and-notebooklm-dont-use-better-ai-they-use-better-intelligence-flow-architecture-ace59eeda531"">Perplexity and NotebookLM don’t use better AI—they use better intelligence flow architecture</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Emerging personality patterns that drive differentiation in AI products</h4><figure><img alt=""Cover image depicting different AI products like Slack bot, Claude, Tolans and Moxie robot."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*r5Fda8lcau0bg7QYOs1FHw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>In 1966, MIT’s Joseph Weizenbaum created ELIZA, a conversational AI that mimicked a Rogerian therapist using simple pattern matching. Despite its limited design, many users felt understood and emotionally “seen,” attributing empathy and intent to the system, a phenomenon later called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect""><strong>“ELIZA effect</strong></a><strong>”. </strong>From the very start, people related to even basic conversational software as if it had a mind of its own.</p><p>Long before modern AI, product and brand design had already embraced personality as a differentiator. <a href=""https://imgs.search.brave.com/bGxPgSeNEiF9Eug7c4YNn_bgulI2vwDeCDJqyq_KKtU/rs:fit:860:0:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9kMmlq/ejZvNXhheTF4cS5j/bG91ZGZyb250Lm5l/dC9hY2NvdW50XzQ4/MS9TY3JlZW5zaG90/MjAxOC0xMS0wOGF0/MTFfMDRfMThBTV81/NDI1N2M0MTI4M2Mx/NWI0YTMxNTRiNjMz/ZDRlY2IxNV84MDAu/cG5n"">Mailchimp’s playful feedback</a> or <a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/slack-copywriting-what-they-say-to-9-6-million-pageviews-every-month-4351888f1c2c"">Slack’s quirky copywriting</a> showed how tone and character could give otherwise functional software a distinctive emotional presence. Design theory reinforces this! <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_Design""><strong>Norman’s emotional design theory</strong></a> shows that products which evoke emotion foster attachment and loyalty<strong>,</strong> while <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism""><strong>anthropomorphism</strong></a><strong> </strong>explains our instinct to assign human traits to machines.<strong> </strong>Sherry Turkle’s research at MIT shows that people form <a href=""https://sts-program.mit.edu/book/alone-together-expect-technology-less-eachother/""><strong>“artificial intimacy”</strong></a> with conversational agents assigning them emotions, motives, and moral qualities as if they were caring entities rather than tools.</p><p>In modern AI systems, this projection becomes even more consequential. Anthropic, for example, shapes <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyJj9RxSsBY""><strong>Claude</strong> around a deliberate character</a> — thoughtful, principled, and balanced — by embedding values and ethical reasoning into how the model thinks and responds.</p><p>Thus<strong>, designing for personality shifts from a branding layer to a core interaction layer </strong>that shapes trust, adoption, and long-term habits.</p><h3>Emerging personality patterns in AI products</h3><p>This framework draws from my work on a virtual pet at <a href=""https://www.ideo.com/"">IDEO</a>, a companion robot at <a href=""https://miko.ai/"">Miko.ai</a>, and most recently an AI tutor at <a href=""https://www.getsupernova.ai/new-home"">SuperNova AI </a>— supported by research (reference list in the end) across HCI, HRI, and narrative design .</p><p>Personality in AI systems is shaped much like a human character with underlying internal traits that drive behavior and external expressive cues that make those traits visible.</p><ul><li><strong>Internal layer</strong> refers to the traits and personality cues like values, worldview, personality archetype, backstory and contextual intelligence.</li><li><strong>External layer</strong> expresses these traits through the surface with avatar, typography, tone of voice, motion, and other multi-modal feedback cues.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""A diagram showing an AI personality model with Internal Layer components on the left and External Layer components on the right, all pointing to a central AI icon.

Purpose, worldview and values</h3><h4><strong>Purpose</strong></h4><p>Purpose is the starting point and shapes the AI’s <em>relationship</em> to the user based on what it helps them accomplish. <br /><br />An AI built to <em>teach</em> will naturally behave differently from one designed to <em>co-create an app or automate commands</em>. <strong>Defining purpose guides —</strong></p><ul><li><em>What is this AI supposed to accomplish for users?</em></li><li><em>What should be the nature of AI-human relation? Is the interaction like interacting with a tool help, a pet/ companion or a collaborator/ supervisor/ assistant?</em></li></ul><p>After purpose, worldview and values form the underlying belief system that makes the AI’s behavior consistent and predictable across different situations.</p><h4><strong>Worldview</strong></h4><p>Defines <em>how the AI interprets problems and reasons under uncertainty, </em>whether it approaches tasks with caution, optimism, curiosity, or analytical detachment. <strong>Defining worldview guides —</strong></p><ul><li><em>How should user needs/ problems be approached?</em></li><li><em>What matters most in its interactions?</em></li></ul><h4><strong>Values</strong></h4><p>Define the AI’s ethical boundaries and priorities — the principles it won’t break. They influence not only <em>what</em> the AI refuses, but <em>how</em> it refuses, shaping the emotional tone of guardrails. <strong>Defining values guides —</strong></p><ul><li>What are the rules it shouldn’t break?</li><li>How should it protect or guide the user?</li></ul><figure><img alt=""A split-screen image explaining Purpose, Worldview, and Values using Claude’s system prompt.

On the right, a screenshot of Amanda Askell’s tweet highlights parts of Claude 3’s system prompt in color-coded boxes labeled Purpose, Worldview, and Values."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*EO0MpbmaiHlyA7ekC7eTLw.jpeg"" /></figure><p><a href=""https://x.com/AmandaAskell/status/1765207842993434880"">Amanda Askell tweet about Claude’s system prompt</a>, reveals how purpose, worldview, and values are explicitly programmed into AI personality — directly shaping how millions of users experience Claude assistant.</p><h3>2. Archetypes</h3><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype#:~:text=An%20archetype%20can%20be%20any,,%20or%20%22merge%22%20into.""><strong>Brand archetypes</strong></a> are universal character prototypes drawn from Carl Jung’s psychology. Brands adopt these familiar personas to evoke specific emotions and embody core values.</p><p>Selecting an archetype helps determine whether your AI feels like a playful entertainer (Jester), a wise advisor (Sage), an empathetic supporter (Caregiver) or any of the other twelve classic archetypes.</p><figure><img alt=""A brand-archetype wheel showing twelve archetypes (Creator, Innocent, Sage, Explorer, Outlaw, Magician, Hero, Lover, Jester, Everyman, Caregiver, Ruler). Various AI products and robots are placed around the wheel to match their archetypes: Moxie and Wysa near Caregiver, Alexa and Siri near Everyman, Miko and Lovots near Lover/Jester, Replika and Character.ai near Lover, Claude near Sage, Anki Cozmo near Explorer, Cursor near Hero, Pepper and Gemini near Creator"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YV4ajRGbz6FDVgyPmzmTPQ.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Choosing an<strong> archetype layer guides</strong> —</p><ul><li><strong>How the AI presents itself visually</strong> — avatar style, colors, motion design</li><li><strong>How the AI communicates</strong> — tone of voice, phrasing, pacing, and conversational behavior.</li></ul><p>For example</p><ul><li><strong>Claude (Sage) </strong>embodies a wise, thoughtful assistant focused on clarity and balanced reasoning. Its warm, calm visual identity and starburst icon signal structure and trust, while its communication style stays gentle, honest, and reflective.</li><li><strong>Wysa (Jester + Coach)</strong> a compassionate, judgment-free companion focused on emotional support and guided healing. Its cute penguin mascot and playful tone signal approachability and warmth, while its communication style stays empathetic, encouraging, and grounded in evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy.</li></ul><p>Archetypes resonate at a subconscious level guiding the design to maintain character consistency and thus strengthening user experience and engagement.</p><h3>3. Backstory</h3><p>In consumer-facing AI, where emotional connection is key, backstory adds coherence and emotional weight to the interaction. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet_on_the_Holodeck"">Janet Murray’s Hamlet on the Holodeck</a> shows that when virtual characters have defined roles and histories, it enriches user interaction and making the system feel more alive and intentional.</p><figure><img alt=""An image of the Miko robot on the left and a chat transcript on the right, where Miko answers questions about its name, age, abilities, and identity with playful personality. A caption explains that Miko robots have rich backstories users uncover through conversation."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MXwMEzP9HuRskUPhuce0Bw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Some successful consumer products which follow this pattern strongly are</p><ul><li><a href=""http://www.miko.ai""><strong>Miko</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The companion robot invites children to ask, <em>“Where did you come from?”, “What’s your job?”, “Are you a boy or a girl?”</em> — revealing his backstory and personality through playful dialogue.</li><li><a href=""https://www.tolans.com/""><strong>Tolan</strong></a><strong>:</strong> General-purpose assistants take on the persona of friendly aliens from planet Portolah, each arriving with distinct personalities and quirks to befriend their human companions</li><li><a href=""https://character.ai/""><strong>Character.ai</strong></a><strong>:</strong> A massive platform where users chat with millions of AI characters, each with detailed backstories, personalities and fictional histories to explore.</li></ul><h3>4. Context adaptation</h3><p>Contextual adaptation is the AI’s ability to respond appropriately to a user’s <strong>situational context or emotional state</strong> and shaping tone, language, and pacing to feel human and supportive.</p><p>This relies on techniques like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_recognition""><strong>emotional state recognition</strong></a> (detecting sentiment or tone), <a href=""https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/ai-mirroring-behaviors""><strong>conversational mirroring</strong></a> (reflecting the user’s phrasing or energy), and <strong>contextual personality shifting</strong> (adjusting tone or style based on task complexity or user mood) .</p><ul><li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa""><strong>Alexa</strong></a>, though simpler, varies its vocal delivery: sounding excited when offering good news (“It’s sunny all day!”) or disappointed when reporting a loss, reinforcing its role as a helpful household companion.</li><li><a href=""https://answeringagent.com/blog/5-ways-ai-adapts-tone-for-customer-calls""><strong>T-Mobile’s AI</strong> reduced customer complaints by 73%</a> through instant detection of negative sentiment and tone mirroring</li><li><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.replika.app&amp;hl=en_IN&amp;pli=1""><strong>Replika</strong></a>, performs deep, long-term mirroring. It learns a user’s vocabulary, emotional patterns, and interaction style over many conversations, gradually shaping its own language, tone, and even “personality” to reflect the individual.</li></ul><h3>5. Visual identity</h3><p>Visual identity is often the first layer through which users infer an AI product’s personality. Design decisions around logo, avatar, color, type and even hardware shapes cues.</p><figure><img alt=""Image showing Perplexity’s geometric logo, Claude’s serif typography, and the Lovot robot. A caption notes that Claude’s serifs feel warm and credible, Perplexity’s sans-serif feels modern and analytical, and Lovot’s soft design conveys a companion-like personality."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sQ7i9Nt3p9T041kdfEAYoQ.jpeg"" /></figure><ul><li><strong>Logo/ Avatar/ Embodied identity </strong>give an AI a recognizable “face” and act as an immediate proxy for personality. For instance, <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/"">Perplexity</a>’s logo, is minimal, geometric, and abstract and it subtly animates during search to cue users that AI is creating an answer. On the other end of the spectrum, more expressive AI products like <a href=""https://lovot.life/en/"">Lovot</a> uses a physical body, large eyes, soft materials, and even personalised clothing to project warmth, affection, and a companion-like presence.</li><li><strong>Typography</strong> contributes to brand voice in chat interfaces. For example, <strong>Claude’s serif typography conveys</strong> warmth, maturity, and approachability — qualities that align with its thoughtful, privacy-first positioning. <strong>Perplexity’s geometric sans-serif communicates</strong> modern technical clarity and reliability, reinforcing its role as a precise, research-oriented tool.</li><li><strong>Illustrations/ Imagery:</strong> Supports communicating information in a delightful way</li><li><strong>Motion and Animation: </strong>Motion guidelines define how elements animate, transition, and respond to user interaction.</li><li><strong>Color palette</strong> reinforce AI personality archetypes by leveraging emotional associations rooted in color psychology. For example. blue signals trust and calm (Alexa), bright green colours signal playfulness and growth (Duolingo, Miko) and muted tones as professionalism (Notion AI).</li></ul><h3>6. Communication style &amp; copy</h3><p>Communication style and copy are also the most visible expressions of an AI’s personality. Whether experienced through <strong>voice or text,</strong> elements like <strong>tone</strong>, <strong>phrasing</strong>, <strong>pacing</strong>, <strong>formality </strong>work together to communicate character’s personality and guide user experience.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Duolingo’s writing guidelines page showing the section on ‘Voice’. It describes how Duolingo’s brand personality appears through words, supported by four voice qualities — expressive, playful, embracing and worldly — with a sidebar menu on the left and an illustration on top"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZOGg6drhwqpcvegAtbKosw.jpeg"" /></figure><h4>Core elements shared across voice and chat interfaces</h4><ul><li><strong>Tone</strong> sets the emotional posture: formal tones (e.g., <em>Sage</em>, <em>Ruler</em>) project authority and professionalism, while informal tones (e.g., <em>Everyman</em>, <em>Jester</em>) build warmth and approachability. For example, <a href=""https://www.capitalone.com/digital/tools/eno/"">Capital One’s Eno</a> uses “First things first” is perceived as friendlier than “Here is the first step” in user research.</li><li><strong>Phrasing and vocabulary</strong> reflect personality cues. For instance, a Caregiver might say “<em>“Let me walk you through this , we’ll figure it out together,”</em>,” while Sage personas might use precise, technical terms (e.g., “<em>“Let me explain the details step by step</em>”).</li><li><strong>Pacing and prosody</strong> (in voice), or <strong>structure and grammar</strong> (in text), shape rhythm and emphasis which is key to emotional delivery and comprehension. Models from <a href=""https://elevenlabs.io/docs/models"">ElevanLabs V3</a> and <a href=""https://cartesia.ai/sonic"">Cartesia</a> uses intentional pauses and inflection to simulate human-like and expressive speech generation.</li></ul><h4>Modality differences: Voice vs. Chat</h4><p>Voice-first interfaces (e.g., Alexa, Miko) rely heavily on <strong>prosody, timing, and conversational repair</strong>. Spoken interactions are adaptive — users naturally adjust tone, pacing, or emphasis when there’s confusion.</p><p>In contrast, chat-based interfaces (e.g., Claude, Perplexity) emphasize <strong>structural clarity, grammar, and concise phrasing</strong>. Because written responses can’t be corrected mid-delivery, users expect a higher degree of accuracy and polish.</p><h3>7. Multimodal feedback</h3><p><strong>Multimodal feedback</strong> refers to the way an AI system expresses its internal states such as listening, thinking, processing, or responding sometime called <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/chain-of-thoughts""><strong>Chain-of-thought (CoT)</strong></a><strong> display </strong>through various visual design elements and multiple sensory channels. These channels can include <strong>visual cues</strong>, <strong>voice and sound design</strong>, <strong>micro-animations</strong>, <strong>LED lights</strong>, or <strong>haptics</strong>.</p><p><strong>It allows users to <em>see</em>, <em>hear</em> or <em>feel</em> what the AI is doing</strong>, making the interaction more interpretable, human-like and trustworthy.</p><figure><img alt=""Four examples of AI systems showing how they express internal state: Replit panels with micro-animations for thinking steps; Alexa device with LED ring phases — idle, listening, thinking, speaking; Duolingo voice call using animated character face; Moxie robot using voice, eyes, and body movement"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2C-JnFqBHXrmlqKoxgfg-g.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Multimodal feedback varies across products depending on how much personality is intended for the product.</p><ul><li><a href=""https://replit.com/ai"">Replit AI</a>, <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/"">Perplexity</a>, <a href=""https://claude.ai/"">Claude</a><strong> </strong>relies on <strong>icon animations</strong> and <strong>microcopy</strong> to communicates system states.</li><li>Alexa devices like <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B8V1LZ3?ref=amzdv_ucc_dp_lod__B09B8V1LZ3&amp;th=1"">Echo dot</a> uses <strong>LED lights</strong>, <strong>voice tone</strong> and <strong>sound effects</strong> to express internal states. The glowing ring is soft and household-friendly, reinforcing her calm, helpful persona.</li><li><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/moxierobot/"">Moxie</a> robot<strong> </strong>combines <strong>voice and non verbal cues </strong>— screen animations, sound effects and hand and body movements<strong> </strong>to communicate states in a child-friendly, playful way consistent with its worldview of empathy and curiosity.</li></ul><h4><strong>Interaction rhythm and timing</strong></h4><p>Interaction rhythm and timing are critical to how AI systems communicate through multimodal cues. Research in human–robot interaction (Michalowski et al., 2007; Hoffman &amp; Breazeal, 2007; Breazeal, 2003) shows when robots align their timing with humans — pausing at the right moments, matching conversational pacing, or synchronizing gesture and gaze —<strong> interactions feel more alive</strong>, more engaging<strong>, more lifelike, and more trustworthy</strong>.</p><p>Products like <strong>Tolans</strong> use coordinated animations, eye-gaze, and motion timing to signal attention and emotional states, making the characters feel alive. Voice agents like <strong>Alexa</strong> similarly use rhythmic cues — brief pauses, LED pulses, and vocal pacing — to create a sense of responsiveness. In both cases, achieving the right timing transforms abstract AI behaviour into something that feels intentional, expressive, and socially fluent.</p><h3>When does personality matter?</h3><p>The fundamental question to ask before designing for personality, if your product needs one and how complex?</p><p>Not every AI system needs a quirky mascot or empathetic voice. The role of personality depends on what problem the product is solving and what users expect from AI<em>.</em></p><figure><img alt=""This chart provides a relative comparison of each product based on how many personality patterns it uses and the depth of their implementation. A more detailed scoring breakdown will be released in a separate article"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MVIKD6P88sCcG2q5gd0IIQ.jpeg"" /></figure><p><strong>In enterprise, B2B SaaS, </strong>or high-utility applications<strong>, personality is kept limited </strong>like professional tone, clear explanations and minimal flair as seen in tools like Ema, Salesforce Einstein or Intercom where u<a href=""http://www.ijdesign.org/index.php/IJDesign/article/view/861/366"">sers value accuracy, compliance, and integration</a>.</p><p><strong>In</strong> <strong>consumer AI</strong>,<strong> personality is often the differentiator</strong> driving engagement, trust, and habit-building where functionality is commoditized. Duolingo’s cheeky Duo, Miko’s playful child companion, Alexa’s polite household voice, Claude’s thoughtful collaborator persona, and Lovable’s friendly co-creative tone all show how personality, delights, stickiness, and emotional connection become as important as utility itself.</p><h3>References</h3><ul><li><a href=""https://www.anthropic.com/research/collective-constitutional-ai-aligning-a-language-model-with-public-input""><strong>Collective Constitutional AI</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Aligning a Language Model with Public Input by Anthropic</li><li><a href=""https://www.anthropic.com/news/introducing-claude""><strong>Introducing Claude</strong></a> (March 2023) by Anthropic</li><li><a href=""https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262533485/hamlet-on-the-holodeck/""><strong>Hamlet on the Holodeck</strong></a>: The future of narrative in cyberspace.

They want to build a product which they are super sure of; they have their pitch deck ready, investors are lined up, and they want to hit market in six months. All they need is a working product: an embodiment of their mission. As a product manager, you do the usual. In a short duration, you conjure up enough details to come up with a roadmap. A plan with all the required features to put the product in the hands of potential users. It is well-detailed, with release dates and launch timelines. You align the team and start development. <strong>What could go wrong?</strong></blockquote><p>Working constantly with early-stage startups has taught me one thing: startups are a minefield of uncertainty. If a founder believes they have all their answers on <strong>day one, </strong>they pretty much have a dream to sell you. It might just say that on the pitch deck.</p><p>In my experience, anything a startup builds in its early stages is a whole lot of assumptions wrapped around a concrete vision. When you start treating these assumptions as ground reality and planning features rather than outcomes, you create a recipe for trouble. A well-documented, timeline-based feature roadmap is often where the problem starts.</p><p>These plans actually give founder and teams a false sense of security. However, teams very quickly realise that:</p><p><strong>Feature roadmaps limit exploration and discovery. </strong>If the boundaries of exploration are limited to a predefined feature set, you quickly find yourself boxed in. Instead of giving the team ample time to actually solve problems, you end up preparing for the next release cycle as the team focuses on building the current feature on the list.</p><p><strong>Feature roadmaps leave little room for new information.</strong> These plans operate under the conviction that all underlying assumptions have been fully priced in, locking potential ideas, features, and deadlines in advance.</p><p>However, as you start working on the product, the <strong><em>act of building</em></strong> itself brings significant clarity. New information either challenges or validates previously made assumptions. As a result, you are compelled to carve out a new shape for the product — one that reflects an evolved understanding, sometimes with a focus on revised outcomes.</p><p>This is where feature roadmaps fail to adapt. They are built for predictability, and any change often leads to delays or scope expansion. You then have to resist new ideas and information just to stay on track with previously set timelines.</p><p><strong>Feature roadmaps have a confidence bias. </strong>They inherently believe that the solution, from the outset, is already fit for the market in its current shape. What is supposed to be a strategic and continuous discovery turns into a scheduling exercise. In reality, just because you are solving the right problem doesn’t mean the current shape of the product will perform well in the market.</p><p><strong>Feature roadmaps underestimate the invisible work.</strong> Development teams often require a fair amount of time and effort to figure out the <em>right</em> way to build before dipping their hands into execution. This is difficult to plan for, as the paths of discovery are not always linear. Sometimes you have to spend more time delivering the same planned item. The timeline is affected not by new demands, but by a well-defined scope.</p><blockquote><em>A PM I know used to say ‘</em><strong><em>Roadmaps are the glue that makes strategy stick to planning’. </em></strong><em>Lately, I feel the longer they are planned for, the </em><strong><em>harder</em></strong><em> they set in, making things very difficult and </em><strong><em>costly</em></strong><em> to pull away.</em></blockquote><p>Don’t get me wrong. I am not saying they are a bad exercise. Early-stage startups <strong>need</strong> to have a vision and a pathway to get there, and roadmaps serve that purpose effectively. What I do take issue with is the way of thinking that propagates building ‘all the things we thought were correct <strong>then</strong>’ at the cost of ‘what we know <strong>now’,</strong> treating previous ideas as gospel truth. A product being built just for the sake of it. It’s a lose-lose situation for everyone.</p><p>So, what’s the alternative?</p><ol><li><strong>Building roadmaps around outcomes, not features. </strong>This gives your team the agility to adapt to one of the umpteen pathways that could be used to arrive at the desired outcome. Outcome-focused roadmaps also ensure that the team focuses on solving the problem at hand and not just checking stories off a to-do list.</li><li><strong>Make clarity your top priority. </strong>Be it through initial research, alpha releases, or targeted experiments, your first three months should focus on validating your assumptions. These will help you plan a more robust roadmap, rather than building a product on ideas made of sand.</li><li><strong>Use the 666 method. </strong>A way of mapping horizons based on what your startup needs to focus on over the next <strong>6 years, 6 months, and 6 weeks</strong>.</li></ol><ul><li><strong>Next 6 years. </strong>This is your north star, the team’s vision of the future six years from now. This will change and evolve as your team learns how your product is built, adopted, and integrated into your users’ lives. Please do not create a fixed plan for six years.</li><li><strong>Next 6 months. </strong>This is your pathway of putting the product in front of your users for the very first time. It is a culmination of all your current beliefs, learnings and insights. The team should assume that only 50–60% of this plan will actually get built. The rest will emerge based on what you discover along the way, creating a need to revisit and revise this plan every couple of months.</li><li><strong>Next 6 weeks. </strong>This is where a feature roadmap makes sense. Once your team is confident on what needs to be built next, create a small, focused plan. Once locked in, changes here should be minimal. Make sure you know what you want to learn from the outcome of these six weeks. <strong>This is the only horizon where going granular is appropriate.</strong></li></ul><p><em>Lastly, learn to </em><strong><em>balance</em></strong><em> and </em><strong><em>realign</em></strong><em>. Planning works best when delivery and discovery are mapped together, each informing and correcting the other.</em></p><p>References:</p><ul><li>Yojji: Roadmap Startup Guide &amp; Examples: <a href=""https://yojji.io/blog/roadmap-startup-guide-examples"">https://yojji.io/blog/roadmap-startup-guide-examples</a></li><li>Clarify: The Art of Product Roadmapping for Early-Stage SaaS Founders: <a href=""https://www.clarify.ai/blog/the-art-of-product-roadmapping-for-early-stage-saas-founders"">https://www.clarify.ai/blog/the-art-of-product-roadmapping-for-early-stage-saas-founders</a></li><li>Product School: Now–Next–Later Roadmap Framework: <a href=""https://productschool.com/blog/product-strategy/now-next-later-roadmap"">https://productschool.com/blog/product-strategy/now-next-later-roadmap</a></li><li>Product plan: Product roadmaps for startups vs enterprises: <a href=""https://www.productplan.com/learn/product-roadmaps-startups-versus-enterprises/"">https://www.productplan.com/learn/product-roadmaps-startups-versus-enterprises/</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9360d392758b"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/why-feature-roadmaps-dont-work-for-early-stage-startups-9360d392758b"">Why feature roadmaps don’t work for early-stage startups</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<p>When it comes to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/j-shape-haircut-trend"">haircut trends</a>, the choice is overwhelming, but if we had to crown one cut as the current style du jour, it would be <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/12/11823303/bob-haircut-trends-2025"">the bob</a>. </p>



<p>Its versatility is what gives <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/kicked-bob-haircut-trend"">the bob</a> an edge over other cuts. Want to go really short? Consider <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/summer-haircut-trends-2025"">the bixie</a>, aka bob-meets-pixie. Worried about losing too much length? Try <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/butterfly-lob-haircut-trend"">the lob</a>, or long bob. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg, because hairstylists from London to Los Angeles are dreaming up new iterations of the cut daily — and we predict that, in 2026, there’ll be no escaping the temptation to brave the scissors.</p>



<p>With that in mind, scroll ahead for the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/choppy-bob-haircut-trend"">bob haircut trends</a> top stylists predict will reign supreme in 2026 and beyond.</p>

<p>Hairstylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/georgecurranhair/?hl=en"">George Curran</a> bills the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/korean-two-in-one-haircut-trend"">Korean bob</a> as one of the most exciting haircut innovations. “The cut is designed so you can have a bob when your hair is tied or clipped up, and long hair when it’s worn down,” says Curren. It’s literally two hairstyles in one. “No extensions and all without committing to losing your length,” adds Curran. “It’s a clever optical illusion haircut using a specialist Korean cutting technique, and it’s perfect for anyone who wants versatility without compromise.” This video posted to Instagram by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DHhiQfwy0fw/?hl=en"">Timothy Ting</a> is mesmerizing. </p>

<p>“This blends charm and delicacy with a modern and lived-in edge,” says Devin Graciano is a professional hairstylist and CEO of <a href=""https://goldielocks.com/"">Goldie Locks</a>. She adds, “The style is lightweight, soft, and full of movement, which gives it that effortless, airy feel,” — but it boasts attitude and intention, too. “The bixie complements the playful and confident person who wears it,” says Graciano. “It’s a cut that feels both current and timeless, with room for personalization depending on texture and personality.” This cut <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DF0IrRkRFc7/?hl=en"">by Jordz</a> is perfect. </p>

<p>Curly hair specialist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/curlvision/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dusty Schlabach</a> predicts that the blunt curly bob will be everywhere. “It’s a zero-layer, ultra-clean blunt bob that sits right at the chin,” says Schlabach, adding, “It’s perfect for medium to low-density curls because it keeps the shape sleek without stacking or creating that Christmas tree effect at the baseline” — no triangular shapes here. Instead, the silhouette is “intentional,” says Schlabach, who suggests asking your stylist to cut your curls dry, exactly in their natural pattern. “Think a straight-across blunt line and no layers — just the slightest, almost invisible A-line so it sits clean at the chin,” says Schlabach. This cut on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DK2gbfBIrVs/?img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nadine Koca</a> is beautiful.</p>

<p>Rather than a clean, blunt line, the ends of the shattered bob are point-cut or “shattered” by slicing into the hair vertically to create a “choppy, airy, slightly fragmented finish,” says Curran, like this look on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DKNboCxibT3/?img_index=1"">Pam Mlunjwana</a>. “It has that effortless, undone vibe,” he continues. But make no mistake: “It’s a very technical cut that relies on precision and the right styling products.” Layering is essential to add movement, says Curran. “You want the hair to have body and flow, without slipping into that helmet-like shape. I remove a lot of weight through the layers, particularly around the [back], which gives the cut bounce and stops it feeling heavy or bulky.”</p>



<p>Curran says the shattered bob looks best when it’s relaxed and a little tousled. “That cool-girl, lived-in texture feels intentional but never overdone.

<p>When Curran thinks of a French bob, the words classic, timeless, and iconic spring to his mind. “In 2025, we saw this style evolve with softer layering around the face,” he says. “But as we head into 2026, it’s all about a more grown-out, effortless version of the look,” like this one by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/C8txZwFMmA6/?img_index=1"">Faick Zekai</a>. According to Curran, it stays sophisticated thanks to a strong, heavy finish through the ends and very minimal layering throughout.</p>

<p>Coined by Graciano, the liquid bob is a “sleek, softly sculpted bob with seamless layers and polished ends that move like fluid.” It’s glossy, weightless, and intentionally refined, she adds. Simply ask your stylist for a “blunt-to-soft perimeter bob,” advises Graciano, complete with subtle internal layering. “Wearing it blow-dried smooth emphasizes shine and swing,” says Graciano. This cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sophie.coastalhair/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tampa hairstylist Sophie</a> is stunning.</p>

<p>The bubble bob — aka rounded layered curly bob, according to Schlabach — is the total opposite of the aforementioned blunt bob. “This cut uses soft, intentional layers to create a rounder, more lifted shape that distributes weight evenly,” says Schlabach. “It’s ideal for dense curls that tend to build bulk at the bottom because the layers prevent heaviness and open up movement throughout the shape.” </p>

<p>The cowgirl bob has a strong ’90s influence, says Curran. “I think it’s going to be a big evolution from the French bob or the blunt, one-length, ultra-polished look à la Sofia Richie-Grainge,” he adds. The cowgirl bob has a few defining attributes: “It’s softer, shaggier, and more relaxed — for those who don’t want a super-sleek finish and prefer a bit more movement and natural texture.” Curran points to Alexa Chung as inspiration. “What I love most is how bespoke you can make it,” adds Curran. “You can tailor it completely to the client and frame the face with soft or grown-out bangs.”</p>



<p>To style it, Curran recommends using a curling iron to create a subtle kick through the ends. “This will enhance that relaxed, cowgirl-inspired movement,” he says. “I always finish with <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/LOr%C3%A9al-TecniArt-Panache-250ml-spray/dp/B07Q75GPTZ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2UNY5RX8L9Z1X&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.p9Dv2Em9KZ1dUuI0qurdCujclzhhzAyGiM37bmtAoSponvWcc6JMQfFW4ReafeK-15dJPdym1YQ9OQvrEVhyMYm41nwHab4lmw28sT1dwxT_FCQ3csuUtaKR5N-k4XLO1BQUR-YsN_ELojTrixV6rjgC66SwDg07Iekz87DrFn7RRt-BvH0yaJplQxCV6v8XsZXroBvUmUZUcI9oE12fr4zep0cLhz6OrQHUnezjdwlO3ULOUh38PY4NQq-yT3Gak9uJAR8Kn9xbn0mODyi1OEDPRLXr-StUPynDMkv9bXM.n-meX568iOuMTSxmPeqJSf-gb0exmG0f1d0m-ivdQIw&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=L%E2%80%99Or%C3%A9al+Professionnel+Tecni+Art+Volume+Panache&amp;qid=1765471158&amp;sprefix=l+or%C3%A9al+professionnel+tecni+art+volume+panache%2Caps%2C81&amp;sr=8-1"">L’Oréal Professionnel Tecni Art Volume Panache</a> to keep the texture airy and full of body.

<p>This is a rounded, gently layered bob, which Graciano says is designed to enhance natural texture. “It keeps the shape airy and controlled, never bulky,” she says — just like this cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DSH36HMDITs/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Faick Zekai</a>. “Ask your stylist for a bob that hits between the jaw and collarbone, with light internal layering and curl-by-curl shaping to maintain softness and movement.”</p>

<p>Brace yourselves: the pob, aka the pixie bob, is making a comeback — and Curran predicts it’ll be one of the standout cuts of 2026. “Think Scarlett Johansson circa 2015 or Victoria Beckham in her 2007 Posh bob era,” says Curran. He adds, “We’re seeing a real shift towards shapes that feel more architectural yet still wearable, and this cut ticks every box. I love the contrast it creates: one side sharp and cropped, the other slightly longer, sweeping, and sculpted.” Even better, Curran says it’s the ideal next step for anyone with a ’90s bob who wants to go shorter. “It’s bold, low-maintenance, and super stylish.” We adore this cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DMLMojRRPcg/?img_index=1"">Sheridan Holyoak</a>. </p>

<p>Schlabach says that the curly lob, or long bob, is a slightly longer version of the bubble and blunt curly bobs. “It’s a shoulder-grazing cut that keeps length while maintaining structure,” adds Schlabach, “and it’s often paired with thoughtful face-framing or a soft veil bang to open up the front and create natural movement.” Thanks to the additional few inches, this style works well across most curl types and densities, says Schlabach. Remember to request some movement around the face to give it dimension, like this cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPhXIzzkmvx/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jessenia Robayo</a>.</p>

<p>Curran says the layered bob was one of the most-liked bob haircuts on TikTok last month. “It’s a longer, ’90s-inspired style with layers at the front and throughout,” much like this cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DNA445KzCBU/?img_index=1"">Miho Mai</a>. The slightly wet-look texture emphasizes the choppiness of the layers, giving it a modern feel, while the lash-grazing full fringe brings in a touch of retro balance.</p>

December is more than just the holidays. It’s also the beginning of the winter arc. If you’re unfamiliar, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/winter-arc-tiktok-fitness-self-improvement"">winter arc</a> is a social trend centered on building healthy, grounding habits during the colder months. For some, that looks like locking in: doing a full physical and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/digital-decluttering-how-to"">digital declutter</a>, taking a financial audit of your 2025 plans, or creating a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/taylor-cassidy-vision-boarding"">vision board</a> for 2026. Meanwhile, others are embracing a slower hibernation mode, like reading that final book on your TBR list, easing into restorative routines, or slowly crocheting a seasonal sweater.<br /><br />Whatever the approach, it’s all a form of preparation for the year ahead, another 365 days filled with opportunities, challenges, and moments of inspiration to plan for and look forward to. While it’s true that the seconds between December 31, 2025 and January 1, 2026 won’t magically transform our lives, there is a shift in energy that takes place. One that invites us to reflect on our wins, acknowledge the lessons, and give ourselves permission to start fresh in the new year.<br /><br />And while you don’t need anything fancy to tap into that New Year energy, there are tools that can make it easier to manifest, plan, organize, and track your progress. Below, we’re sharing stationery picks, motivational prints, and energy-clearing essentials to help you step confidently into your next chapter.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

Palo santo, a fragrant wood traditionally used in South America, is known for its warm, resinous scent and its ability to create a grounding atmosphere.
