<p>Cities bring together the best and worst of the human condition. They concentrate opportunities for work, social networks, and cultural production, but they also expose deep social inequalities. Among the many forms of urban exclusion are limited access to transportation, housing, leisure, or safety issues. One form that is rarely discussed is thermal inequality. In lower-income neighborhoods, where there are fewer trees, parks, and permeable surfaces, heat accumulates and thermal discomfort dominates, resulting in higher energy consumption and health risks. As concern about the climate crisis grows, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1031146/heat-resilient-design-how-city-leaders-use-building-materials-to-fight-urban-heat"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">this discussion becomes more urgent</a>: extreme heat is no longer just a climatic phenomenon but also a spatial expression of inequality.</p>",

It is not a foreign object, but a fragment of the mountain, a inhabited sculpture that breathes with the same cadence as the forest.

<h4>Developing product discovery judgment through psychological safety, collaboration, and systematic practices.</h4><figure><img alt=""Hero image depicting AI-human collaboration: teal circuit board patterns on the left representing AI technology merges with four coral hands reaching from the right representing human teamwork. A lightbulb with leaves and gear at center symbolizes technology and human judgment working together."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rdR9Hv4HENPwDvX4xZEhiA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>How do you develop the judgment to decide what software is worth building when AI makes building it faster and cheaper?</p><p>This article explores how to systematically strengthen discovery judgment, whether you’re building solo or as a team. For background on why judgment becomes the critical constraint when AI accelerates execution, see my previous article “<a href=""https://medium.com/@gale.robins/it-seems-anyone-can-build-software-now-how-do-you-build-the-right-software-182057dfa122"">When building software became easier with AI, deciding became harder.</a>”</p><p>The answer lies not in better tools or more time, but in three interconnected capabilities: psychological safety that permits genuine learning, cross-functional collaboration that surfaces diverse perspectives, and systematic frameworks that make assumptions explicit and testable. These are the human systems that transform discovery from a sequence of tasks into a continuous learning loop where reasoning itself improves with every cycle.</p><figure><img alt=""Venn diagram with three overlapping circles showing how teams develop discovery judgment through Psychological Safety (permits genuine learning), Cross-Functional Collaboration (surfaces diverse perspectives), and Systematic Frameworks (makes assumptions explicit). The center intersection labeled ‘Judgment Development: Compounds Over Time’ shows these three capabilities working together."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/842/1*wFJsuiR4rL7hYAhP9i4diQ.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>Cross-functional teams, comprising product managers, engineers, designers, user researchers, and others, each bring unique perspectives to the discovery process. However, judgment only develops when these perspectives combine. The challenge isn’t getting better at your own function. It’s learning to reason together.</p><p>Solo founders and small teams face the same challenge from a different angle: you must develop these multiple perspectives within yourself. Product thinking, technical feasibility, design usability, business viability, you’re constantly reasoning across all these domains, continually switching contexts rapidly. The practices that help teams combine perspectives also help solo builders systematically develop multifaceted judgment.</p><blockquote>“Psychological safety isn’t about being nice — it’s about being real.”<br /> — Amy Edmondson, <em>The Fearless Organization</em> (2019)</blockquote><h3>The Human Side of Discovery</h3><p>Here’s the thing most organizations miss: judgment doesn’t develop through better frameworks. It develops through vulnerability.</p><p>When you admit “I was wrong about this assumption” without fear, when you kill ideas you love because evidence doesn’t support them, when you pivot after publicly committing to a direction — that’s when judgment grows.</p><p>Amy Edmondson’s research in <em>The Fearless Organization</em> (2019) shows that people learn faster when mistakes are treated as data, rather than a deficiency. Without this psychological safety, discovery becomes performative. Interviews occur, but inconvenient findings are often overlooked. Usability tests run, but only feedback that confirms gets heard. Teams cherry-pick evidence that confirms existing beliefs. Research on software teams confirms that psychological safety consistently ranks among the strongest predictors of team performance and innovation because it enables learning behaviours that improve judgment over time (Obasanjo, 2017). AI acceleration exacerbates this issue, amplifying bias rather than wisdom.</p><figure><img alt=""Comparison diagram contrasting Performative Discovery (ignoring inconvenient findings, cherry-picking evidence, hiding mistakes, unsafe environment) versus Genuine Discovery (examining evidence objectively, seeking disconfirming data, treating mistakes as learning). An arrow labeled ‘Psychological Safety Enables the Shift’ shows the transformation between the two approaches."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1023/1*3ayfvKhZ0XiAKoAHKYrHkw.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>I learned this the hard way. Early in my career, leading product teams, I created an environment where people said yes to my ideas, not because they were validated, but because challenging authority felt risky. A team member eventually told me privately, ‘We built that feature, but no one felt comfortable saying it didn’t solve the customer’s actual problem.’ I recognized that courage immediately; I’d been the junior person speaking truth to power myself. I took the feedback as a gift. That moment taught me that psychological safety isn’t a nice-to-have; it’s the foundation of sound judgment and decision-making.</p><p>The challenge runs deeper than individual courage. Even in organizations that espouse flat structures, power dynamics shape which voices get heard. When product managers treat discovery ownership as <em>exclusive</em> rather than <em>collaborative</em>, engineers and designers stay silent, assuming ‘that’s the PM’s job.’ Senior voices dominate while junior insights go unheard.</p><p>User researchers face a particular challenge: they’re trained in evidence rigour and bias detection, yet their insights often get filtered through PMs rather than informing decisions directly. When research findings contradict existing plans, psychological safety determines whether teams adjust their approach or rationalize it.</p><p>Real discovery requires cross-functional sense-making. A user researcher observes patterns in how users describe their workflow. A designer notices that users are misunderstanding the navigation flow. An engineer sees users accessing features through indirect paths. A customer success rep recalls multiple support tickets about this workflow. A product manager connects these signals to a strategic question about information architecture. None would have seen the complete picture on their own. This is collaborative judgment, different perspectives combining to form an understanding that no single function could achieve.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram showing cross-functional discovery with five roles (User Researcher, Designer, Engineer, Customer Success, Product Manager) contributing different observations that converge on a shared insight: Information Architecture needs investigation. Arrows point from each role toward the center, illustrating collaborative judgment that no single function could achieve alone."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QXW1HAAWn5yoSLX2WNtUEQ.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>Over time, something even more valuable happens. Engineers who participate in discovery with customer success start asking different questions about architecture. Designers who review analytics with engineers propose solutions aligned with observed behaviour patterns. Product managers who examine implementation complexity develop intuition for feasibility. You’re not just contributing expertise, you’re expanding your judgment by exposure to how others think.</p><h3>Expanding Beyond Your Lane</h3><h4>For Solo Founders and Small Teams</h4><p>You might think cross-functional judgment doesn’t apply to you; you’re already wearing all the hats. But that’s precisely the challenge: switching rapidly between perspectives (technical, business, user, design) without systematic practices leads to decision fatigue and blind spots.</p><p>Solo founders often skip discovery practices because “I don’t have time” or “I am the PM and the engineer and the designer.” AI accelerates building, which means you can build the wrong thing faster. Speed without judgment wastes resources at an accelerated pace. The systematic practices below help you develop multi-perspective judgment, compensating for working alone.</p><h4>For Larger Teams</h4><p>Cross-functional discovery can feel uncomfortable.</p><p>As a user researcher, why should you understand technical constraints? As an engineer, why should you sit in customer conversations? As a designer, why should you know about business viability? As a product manager, why is it necessary to understand research methodology?</p><p>Because AI is commoditizing siloed expertise, AI can generate code, create designs, draft requirements, and even synthesize interview transcripts.</p><p>What AI can’t replicate is integrating perspectives across functions to decide what’s worth building. That integration, that judgment, is what makes cross-functional teams valuable.</p><p>This doesn’t mean abandoning your core expertise. It means expanding your contribution beyond your functional lane.</p><p>Start small: Join one discovery conversation outside your usual domain. Ask questions. Listen to how others reason about problems. You’re not abandoning your lane, you’re learning to see the whole road.</p><blockquote>“We can’t let AI seduce us into believing it can do our thinking for us.”<br /> — Brené Brown, <em>Strong Ground</em> (2025)</blockquote><h3>AI as Collaborator, Not Replacement</h3><p>As Brené Brown discusses in her <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/live/zdkKNC4gP1Y"">Fast Company interview</a> (38 minutes) and explores in <em>Strong Ground</em> (2025), many organizations are experiencing what she calls a “collective anxiety about AI”, chasing tools without confronting the human work: vulnerability, truth-telling, and courage.</p><p>This is the challenge of discovery in the AI era: not competing with machines, but building human capacities — deep connection, deep thinking, and deep collaboration.</p><p>So what does this mean for discovery practice?</p><p>After Jobs-to-Be-Done interviews, AI can analyze transcripts in minutes: clustering themes, identifying recurring language, spotting emotional intensity, and surfacing contradictions. It can generate comprehensive assumption maps covering desirability, viability, feasibility, usability, and ethics.</p><p>But AI doesn’t know what matters. It can identify patterns but can’t feel the weight of user frustration. It can cluster themes but can’t sense when an interview reveals something genuinely novel. Recent MIT research examining hundreds of human-AI collaborations found that while these partnerships often underperformed on decision-making tasks, they showed significant gains in content creation tasks, such as generating and synthesizing new content, where humans provide contextual judgment that AI cannot replicate (Vaccaro et al., 2024). AI can’t fully contextualize insights against organizational realities, unstated strategic priorities, the team member who’s burned out, the competitive shift that’s not yet reflected in the data, or a coming regulatory change. Most critically, you decide what’s “good enough” when evidence is sufficient to proceed, when to test further, and when to abandon a direction. These threshold judgments require wisdom that can’t be automated.</p><p>A team identifies opportunities based on customer research—AI analyses which align with strategic outcomes and flags contradictory signals. The team reviews: Does this prioritization make sense given our competitive position? Which patterns might be artifacts of the recruitment process? AI has accelerated analysis; humans make meaning from it. They select an opportunity, AI generates an assumption map, and humans evaluate which assumptions are riskiest, then design experiments to test them.</p><p>This continuous loop, where AI synthesizes and suggests, and humans interpret and decide, creates discoveries that are both faster and thoughtful. But this partnership works best when supported by systematic frameworks that make judgment visible and teachable.</p><figure><img alt=""Circular flow diagram showing 5-step AI-human collaboration loop: AI Synthesizes (analyzes patterns), Humans Interpret (determines meaning), AI Generates (creates options), Humans Evaluate (assesses context), Humans Decide (makes judgment call).

Center reads ‘Faster + Thoughtful Discovery."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/671/1*L4BscTXYNVViyLgQLiXz4Q.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><h3>Making Judgment Visible</h3><p>Whatever discovery frameworks you use, Jobs-to-Be-Done, Opportunity Solution Trees, Assumption Mapping, or your own approach, the key is making implicit assumptions explicit and testable. Frameworks matter not because they’re rigid processes, but because they create shared language for reasoning together.</p><blockquote>“Frameworks matter not because they’re rigid processes, but because they create shared language for reasoning together.”</blockquote><p>The principle: your frameworks and tools should force specificity and enable evidence-based reasoning. Jobs-to-Be-Done, for instance, requires what practitioners describe as a fundamental “mindset change,” shifting the focus from product features to the underlying jobs customers are trying to accomplish (Gecis, 2021). Teams can’t hide behind “users want better collaboration.” They must specify: What job are users hiring our product to do? How do they measure progress? What alternatives exist, and why are those inadequate?</p><p>Tools like Opportunity Solution Trees help teams visualize the path from desired outcomes through opportunities to solutions, deliberately slowing teams down to explore the opportunity space rather than jumping immediately to solutions (Corbett, 2023). Similarly, Assumption Mapping forces teams to articulate what would need to be true for their approach to succeed across the dimensions of desirability, viability, and feasibility. Making assumptions explicit surfaces disagreements before they become expensive mistakes, a critical practice given that product teams typically find nine out of ten product assumptions prove false when tested (Podzorska, 2023). Evidence tracking ensures that insights don’t get lost and maintains lineage, clarifying which opportunities are supported by evidence versus speculation.</p><p>Solo founders benefit from these frameworks in different ways. Where teams use frameworks to create shared language, solo builders use them to make implicit thinking explicit — writing down assumptions forces you to examine your own reasoning. Documenting evidence trails helps you catch your own confirmation bias. These aren’t just team collaboration tools; they’re personal judgment development practices.</p><p>What matters isn’t which specific frameworks or tools you adopt, it’s ensuring your discovery process produces the insights and evidence required for sound judgment and decision-making.</p><h3>You Don’t Need Permission to Begin</h3><p>Change doesn’t have to wait for mandates or executive buy-in. It can start with just one person choosing to work differently. Informal leaders, individuals without formal authority, consistently spark real change through a shared vision, reciprocal relationships, and an emphasis on process.</p><p>When your work demonstrates more explicit reasoning and better outcomes, others notice, whether “others” refers to your team, investors, customers, or future collaborators. This isn’t passive “leading by example”, it’s intentional demonstration. Become the person who consistently asks the right questions, who can articulate why a direction is worth pursuing with evidence rather than conviction. As Brené Brown observes, “Courage is contagious.” When you make your reasoning visible, admit when you’re wrong, and kill your own ideas based on evidence, that vulnerability invites others to do the same.</p><p>Here’s why starting now matters: as AI speeds execution up and lowers costs, judgment becomes exponentially more valuable. The talent market is segmenting professionals who use AI to execute faster while thinking the same way, versus professionals who use AI to amplify their judgment, competing on wisdom and strategic value. The latter group becomes increasingly valuable precisely because judgment can’t be automated.</p><p>Speed without judgment isn’t progress, it’s expensive failure at scale. When anyone can build anything, competitive advantage shifts to building the right things. The teams that thrive will be those who learn the fastest, make decisions with clarity, and discover unmet needs before their competitors do.</p><p>You can wait for your organization to recognize this shift, or you can start building this capability now, positioning yourself among the judgment-oriented professionals who will thrive in the AI era.</p><p>Start with one small practice:</p><p><strong>If you’re building solo:</strong></p><ul><li>Document assumptions before building — create a simple “What must be true for this to work?” list.</li><li>After customer conversations, capture what surprised you about your own thinking, not just about customers.</li><li>When you pivot, document why — your future self needs to understand your reasoning.</li><li>Use AI to question your thinking: “Here’s what I learned, what am I missing?” However, remember that AI provides pattern-based analysis, while you provide meaning-based judgment.</li></ul><p><strong>If you’re working in a team:</strong></p><ul><li>Document your assumptions before your next sprint, just for yourself, in a simple document.</li><li>In retrospectives, add one question: “What surprised us about our own thinking?”</li><li>Share your reasoning when someone asks why you made a decision, including what you were uncertain about.</li><li>Invite one person from a different function to your next discovery conversation.</li><li>When you pivot based on evidence, quantify what you learned: “This assumption-mapping session revealed a critical usability flaw before we wrote code, which saved us two sprints.”</li></ul><p>Find allies. One person practising this alone is interesting. Three people practising together across functions is a movement.</p><p><strong>Which practice will you start with?</strong> Document assumptions? Add a reflection question to your retro? Invite someone from another function to your next discovery conversation? Drop a comment below.</p><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Psychological safety and cross-functional collaboration are preconditions for the development of discovery judgment; without them, discovery becomes performative.</li><li>AI acts as a collaborator, accelerating synthesis while leaving meaning-making, interpretation, and final judgment to humans.</li><li>Frameworks and tools like Jobs-to-Be-Done and Assumption Mapping make implicit assumptions explicit and testable, creating a shared language for reasoning.</li><li>Individual practice scales into cultural change: one person modelling the required behaviour and validating assumptions can spark team-level learning and systemic improvement.</li><li>The talent market is segmenting: those who use AI to execute faster while thinking the same way, versus those who use AI to amplify their judgment and decision-making.</li></ul><h3>References</h3><p>Brown, B.

<h4>A great time to innovate democracy, while the technology is in place.</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/812/1*Z60XLFCjRC8ahtlyGAydCw.png"" /><figcaption>Wireframe illustrating how comments could be rated for clarity, insight, and inclusiveness in real time</figcaption></figure><p>About twenty years ago, just after turning eighteen, I tried to follow politics because I cared about living in a fair society. I wanted everyone to have food, healthcare, safety, education — the basics any decent person wishes for others. But politics felt toxic: shouting, accusations, and no real progress. Even the word began to feel heavy.</p><p>I know I’m not alone; many people feel frustrated or disconnected. Yet politics should be noble — collaboration, empathy, coexistence.</p><p>So I’m writing this to explore how technology and digital design might help us rebuild that connection and make democracy feel human again.</p><h3>The bad side of politics and technology</h3><p>It’s almost impossible to separate politics from technology today. Every major shift in communication has reshaped how we organise, argue, and imagine our future. New tools always begin as freedom — more voices, more access, more possibility — but over time they start shaping us in ways we barely notice. Social media felt like a new democracy at first, until algorithms pushed us into <strong>echo chambers, doom scrolling </strong>and trained us to react instead of <strong>reflect</strong>. Technology can amplify <strong>empathy or anger</strong>, truth or distortion. It depends on <strong>how we design it.</strong> If we build tools that <strong>reward curiosity over conflict,</strong> politics could start to feel human again.</p><p><strong>Propaganda</strong> isn’t new, but technology has made it <strong>faster</strong>, more <strong>precise</strong>, and far more <strong>personal</strong>. In the past, newspapers and radio spread broad, one-size-fits-all messages. Today, algorithms whisper tailored narratives to each of us. The Cambridge Analytica scandal highlighted how personal data can influence political persuasion, but similar patterns have also been observed in Europe. Ahead of the 2024 EU elections, researchers uncovered coordinated disinformation networks operating across France, Germany, and Italy, using fake accounts to quietly influence voter perception. This is the new propaganda: subtle, targeted, and often unnoticed — not designed to inform us, but to keep us engaged and predictable.</p><p>If we want more harmonious communities, we must rebuild <strong>respect</strong>, <strong>trust</strong>, and <strong>understanding</strong>. This isn’t just about better apps — it’s about better values. A healthy digital political system rests on a few core principles: a <strong>thirst for truth</strong> over partisanship; <strong>transparency by default</strong> in decisions and algorithms; <strong>effectiveness</strong> in solving real problems; <strong>equal access to voice</strong> regardless of power; and <strong>truth before speed</strong>, prioritising accuracy over virality. It also requires <strong>agility</strong>, allowing nuanced positions; <strong>holism</strong>, showing how issues connect; <strong>simplicity</strong>, making participation approachable; and <strong>decentralised ownership</strong> to prevent concentrated control. These values must guide the technology we design next.</p><h4>Designing a Political Platform That Supports Equilibrium</h4><p>A fictional glimpse of this future appears in <a href=""https://turnerstories.medium.com/the-democr-app-96895f45b680"">N. A. Turner’s short story <em>“The Democr App.”</em></a> In it, society runs on constant digital referendums, with citizens voting directly on everything from climate policy to economic reform. Turner captures the tension at the heart of radical digital democracy through one of his characters:</p><blockquote>Mouse87 still wondered if the majority could decide what is true and just for the entire nation. Could the people govern themselves? He believed they could. He had to. It was part of his design… to unite people, to let democracy shine in its truest form. But he made one mistake. Mouse87 wanted people to become equal, but no two persons are the same, let alone a whole nation.</blockquote><p>This fictional moment reveals a real-world challenge: if technology is going to serve democracy, it must be built for <strong>equilibrium, not engagement</strong> — helping people understand before they react, listen before they judge, and collaborate before they divide.</p><p>Imagine a platform where political discussion doesn’t lead to outrage or exhaustion, but to clarity. Instead of a chaotic feed, citizens move through a guided process that adds context, shows diverse perspectives, and explains how each decision touches real life. Every issue is presented holistically: the problem, public feelings, solutions, supporters, opposers, risks, and consequences. The platform wouldn’t punish disagreement; it would encourage <strong>informed disagreement</strong>.</p><p>The biggest risk to be addressed is that people are emotional thinkers. We rely on shortcuts, familiar ideas, and content that feels good. That makes building a political platform for understanding — not reaction — uniquely challenging. Echo chambers can quietly return. Misinformation spreads fast. Power can be centralised. People get overwhelmed or tune out. Privacy must be protected. Algorithms can inherit cultural bias. And cynicism can make citizens feel their participation doesn’t matter. These risks aren’t technical — they’re human. The goal isn’t perfection but <strong>transparency, safety, and adaptability</strong>, designing for how people actually think while gently helping them grow toward deeper, fairer public understanding.</p><figure><img alt=""Cleisthenes the founder of Athenian democracy"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/320/1*KG9RVtDI285nG1Vwz8De-w.gif"" /><figcaption>Cleisthenes the founder of Athenian democracy (created with Sora)</figcaption></figure><h3>Proposal</h3><p>I propose to build a digital democratic platform designed for civic matters. A space where citizens explore issues through context, clarity, and diverse perspectives. The proposed solution is inspired by a collection of technologies and methodologies that already exist in the market.</p><h4>Modernising the democratic process</h4><p>Modern democracies could learn from how product teams build great systems: through continuous cycles of learning, testing, and improvement. In tech, decisions aren’t final — they’re iterated. After research, prototyping, and alignment, products launch, are monitored, refined, and improved again.</p><p>Our political systems rarely work this way. Voting is treated as the end of the process, not the beginning of a learning loop. Imagine instead a democratic cycle that mirrors product development: <strong>collect facts</strong>, <strong>collect people’s feelings</strong>, <strong>ideate</strong>, <strong>vote</strong>, <strong>enforce and monitor</strong>, then <strong>learn and iterate</strong>. Decisions would become living processes, shaped by data, experience, and citizen feedback.</p><figure><img alt=""Modern Democratic Process contains 5 steps that repeat in a loop"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Vg8TQB8kmhEWPoHg3_Ifrg.png"" /><figcaption>Modern Democratic Process</figcaption></figure><p>This concept is not only mine to share; the minister of the digital affairs of Taiwan, Audrey Tang, explained with some major wins in his announcement.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/378431ed5045273f32d50ae23e346c34/href"">https://medium.com/media/378431ed5045273f32d50ae23e346c34/href</a><h4>Modernising democratic roles</h4><p>Modernising democracy also means modernising our <strong>roles</strong> within it. A healthier system depends on shared participation, not hierarchy</p><ul><li><strong>Citizens</strong> — Stay curious, seek holistic truth, and engage respectfully with the community. Understanding comes before opinion.</li><li><strong>Representatives &amp; Experts</strong> — Study issues deeply, gather reliable evidence, and communicate clearly. Their role is to <strong>guide</strong>, not rule.</li><li><strong>Journalists &amp; Communicators</strong> — Go beyond reporting outcomes. Explain processes, challenge assumptions, and make complex information accessible and accurate.</li><li><strong>Moderators &amp; Facilitators</strong> — Ensure discussions remain constructive, inclusive, and fact-based. Conversations need care, not control</li></ul><h4>Getting inspired by existing tools</h4><p>This proposal isn’t built from scratch; it stands on the shoulders of platforms already pushing civic understanding forward. Across the world, tools from deliberation to fact-checking show how technology can reduce bias, reveal context, and support healthier public dialogue. Below are the key inspirations:</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/287411905cf22ca0843b2f5dbdd50386/href"">https://medium.com/media/287411905cf22ca0843b2f5dbdd50386/href</a><h3>Platform Features</h3><h4>Civilian Contributions</h4><p>This is the heart of the platform — the <strong>civilian contributions</strong>, or what we usually call <em>posts</em>. Every user can contribute something meaningful: an idea, a problem, an opinion, a question, or even an opportunity for improvement. Contributions can be connected to existing topics or open entirely new ones.</p><p>But here, it’s not just <em>what</em> you say that matters — it’s <em>how</em> you say it.<br />The platform’s goal is to <strong>guide users toward expressing ideas in a fair, respectful, and inclusive way</strong>, helping people frame their thoughts with clarity and empathy. The tone should promote understanding, not hostility.</p><p>When creating a post, the system gently assists the user in identifying <strong>who might be affected</strong> — both positively and negatively — and what <strong>risks or consequences</strong> the idea might carry. This helps transform a simple complaint or reaction into a <strong>civic contribution</strong> — a statement grounded in awareness and responsibility.</p><p>Example:</p><ul><li><strong>Initial Post:</strong><br /> <em>“It was about time for an accident. Our roads suck!”</em></li><li><strong>Guided Contribution:</strong><br /> <em>“After the accident last week on James Bond Street, I’ve noticed how poor visibility is around that area. I completely understand the need to illuminate archaeological monuments beautifully, but perhaps we can adjust the lighting design to make the road safer for drivers and pedestrians.”</em></li></ul><h4>Engaging With Contributions</h4><p>Once a post is shared, the conversation truly begins. Engagement on this platform isn’t about collecting likes — it’s about <strong>building knowledge together</strong>. Users can interact with a post by adding <strong>further research</strong>, <strong>supporting documents</strong>, <strong>related ideas</strong>, or <strong>personal experiences</strong> that enrich the discussion. Reactions are not noise; they are part of the learning process. Every contribution adds a layer of understanding to the original idea.</p><p>As discussions grow, the system detects when a post gains meaningful traction — not through volume, but through depth, balance, and constructive participation.</p><p>For example, imagine the earlier post about the <strong>James Bond Street accident</strong>. As others contribute — a local architect sharing a visibility report, a cyclist uploading a nighttime video, a city planner linking to safety regulations — the post evolves into a valuable public thread. The system may then elevate it to the top of the <strong>#Transportation</strong> section, where local authorities, journalists, or experts can see it easily.</p><p>Contributing to engagements becomes a <strong>path to collaboration</strong>, connecting citizens, experts, and decision-makers around the same living issue.</p><h4>Feedback, Evaluation, and Reporting Layer</h4><p>Every contribution can be evaluated by the community through a <strong>structured feedback model</strong>. Instead of quick reactions, users can mark a post as <em>helpful</em>, <em>insightful</em>, <em>unclear</em>, or <em>biased</em>. They can also add short notes explaining why — offering specific, respectful observations rather than emotional responses.</p><p>Take the example of the <strong>James Bond Street accident post</strong>. As the discussion grows, others might respond like this:</p><ul><li><em>“Helpful — this identifies a recurring safety issue and offers context.”</em></li><li><em>“Unclear — it’s not clear who manages street lighting in that zone; can you clarify?”</em></li><li><em>“Insightful — linking the lighting to archaeological site preservation adds an interesting angle.”</em></li></ul><p>This structured feedback system <strong>evaluates quality</strong>, not <strong>popularity</strong>. Thoughtful, diverse responses elevate a post; unclear ones prompt clarification or community notes. Citizens can <strong>flag</strong> <strong>misinformation</strong> or harm, triggering contextual reviews rather than punishment. Over time, this<strong> two-way process</strong> teaches users to communicate better and helps the platform highlight substance over outrage.</p><h4>Enhanced Community Notes</h4><p>Community Notes has proven that <strong>context builds trust</strong>. When users add explanations instead of blunt “misleading” labels, people are more likely to believe the correction and share less misinformation. A study <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/29/2/taae006/7644305"">published</a> by Oxford University Press found that contextual notes were <em>significantly more trusted</em> than standard misinformation flags.</p><p>A University of California, San Diego <a href=""https://today.ucsd.edu/story/community-notes-accuracy-study"">analysis</a> confirmed that Community Notes were <strong>highly accurate and credible</strong>, especially for vaccine-related posts. Similarly, research on <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00916"">arXiv reported </a>that when a note is attached to a misleading post, engagement drops sharply — reposts by ~45% and likes by ~43%.</p><p>Still, the model struggles with <strong>speed, diversity, and visibility</strong>.<br />Many viral posts never receive notes in time, and a <strong>small group of contributors</strong> writes the majority. This pattern was noted in a large-scale <a href=""https://ddia.org/"">data transparency report</a> and in follow-up analyses on Wikipedia.</p><p>Because the platform isn’t optimised for speed or emotional reactions, each post is first shared with a segment of users who have expertise in that topic. This allows knowledgeable contributors to add early context and Community Notes. If the post begins gaining traction, a <strong>community review mode</strong> activates, inviting a wider and more diverse group of users to contribute additional context before the content spreads further.</p><p>All notes appear directly within the post, with the system’s LLM providing clear, neutral summaries.</p><h4>Algorithm for Understanding</h4><p>Most digital platforms today are built around one metric — <em>engagement</em>. Their algorithms are designed to maximise <strong>emotion, outrage, and addictive scrolling</strong>, because the longer we stay online, the more ads we see, and the more profitable the system becomes.</p><p>Our platform must take the opposite path. Instead of optimising for emotion, it optimises for <strong>understanding</strong>. Instead of amplifying what divides, it surfaces what connects.</p><p>The algorithm’s purpose is to <strong>guide comprehension</strong>. It promotes content that helps people see the full picture, not just the side that fits their bias.</p><p><strong>Algorithm key principles:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Relevance First</strong><br /> Content is served to the people who can meaningfully enrich it: citizens directly affected, experts with relevant insight, and communities equipped to help. This creates deeper engagement, allowing posts to gather context, sources, impacts, and risks — rather than shallow reactions or fragments.</p><p><strong>2. Exposure to Multiple Viewpoints</strong><br /> The system deliberately broadens perspectives. It resurfaces skipped materials, introduces contrasting views, and reduces the blind spots that create echo chambers.</p><p><strong>3. Promote Thoughtful contributions</strong><br />Thoughtful contributions are highlighted above heated or repetitive ones, shifting the culture from reaction to reflection. This slows the rush toward instant opinions and encourages users to pause, explore context, and consider alternative viewpoints before responding.</p><h4>Join Discussion Rooms</h4><p>When a topic gains traction and enough information is gathered, it can evolve into a <strong>virtual discussion room</strong> — an open dialogue space where citizens, experts, and representatives come together to exchange ideas in real time.</p><p>Because these discussions are hosted within the platform, all previously gathered data helps <strong>structure the meeting</strong> through dedicated moderator tools. Insights generated during the session are then fed back into the platform, enriching the topic’s knowledge base and improving the ongoing civic process.</p><p>Each session is moderated by a <strong>certified facilitator</strong> from the platform’s community, whose role is to ensure inclusivity, respect, and focus. After the discussion ends, participants can rate the moderator’s fairness and clarity, creating a transparent feedback loop that strengthens future sessions.</p><h4>Open Source and Transparency</h4><p>At the foundation of this platform lies a commitment to <strong>transparency</strong>. Every major component — from the algorithm that ranks posts to the data that informs decisions — should be <strong>open source</strong> and publicly auditable. People must be able to see how information moves, how visibility is determined, and how their contributions are valued.</p><p>By keeping the code, funding sources, and moderation logic open, the platform earns trust through visibility, not promises. Just as citizens can participate in discussions, they can also participate in improving the system itself — submitting code, suggesting fixes, or analysing biases in real time.</p><p>Openness makes corruption harder and collaboration easier. It turns the system into a <strong>public good</strong>, owned and shaped by the very people it serves.</p><p>And importantly, as highlighted by the <a href=""https://medium.com/@lyakova7?source=post_page---post_author_info--06def9faf439---------------------------------------"">Association Redefine</a>, open source creates <strong>long-term resilience</strong>. Even if a project shuts down, communities can continue developing and maintaining the tools because the code belongs to everyone. Investments don’t vanish — they evolve into a living civic ecosystem that outlives any single platform</p><h3>Visualising Data for Clarity</h3><p>A civic platform can generate thousands of posts, threads, and interactions. To make this complexity understandable, we need simple, smart visualisations that reveal the shape of the conversation at a glance. These visuals help each person see where they stand, how the community thinks, and how decisions evolve.</p><p>We focus on <strong>five key visual tools</strong>:</p><ol><li><strong>Profile Map</strong> —helps you understand <em>how</em> you participate in the civic space.</li><li><strong>Press Landscape</strong> — compares how different media sources frame the same issue.</li><li><strong>Community Landscape</strong> — clusters related discussions to reveal priorities and tensions.</li><li><strong>Debate Pathways</strong> — maps the flow of arguments from context to risks.</li><li><strong>Voting Impact Map</strong> — shows how different votes influence outcomes and each other.</li></ol><h4><strong>Profile Map</strong></h4><p>Inspired by the philosophy behind <strong>Readocracy</strong>, it doesn’t measure popularity; it measures <strong>depth, diversity, and quality</strong> of your engagement.</p><p>Your Profile Map reflects things like:</p><ul><li>the topics you explore</li><li>the perspectives you’ve engaged with</li><li>the clarity and helpfulness of your contributions</li><li>your willingness to consider alternative views</li></ul><p>Over time, the Profile Map becomes a visual record of your learning journey — showing how your understanding evolves and where your strengths or blind spots may lie</p><figure><img alt=""A dark dashboard showing “Profile Data” with sections on media bias, news ratio, mood, content tendencies, and professional interests.

Instead of a chaotic comment feed, opinions are grouped into clusters, making patterns visible at a glance.</p><p>You can instantly see:</p><ul><li>areas of broad consensus</li><li>viewpoints gaining traction</li><li>minority positions that add nuance</li><li>topics that need more voices or clarity</li></ul><figure><img alt=""A polling interface displays a statement about requiring passenger liability insurance for riders in private ride-share vehicles, with options to agree or disagree.

Digital platforms have given millions of people a voice, but they have also enabled manipulation, polarisation, and propaganda at a scale that was once unimaginable. Elections, public opinion, and social movements are now influenced not just by policies and ideas, but by algorithms, recommendation feeds, and data-driven emotional triggers.</p><p>If democracy is to survive and evolve, it must adapt to this new reality. And to do that, we must ask a deeper question:</p><blockquote>What makes democracy strong in the first place?</blockquote><p>The answer is not just voting, nor simply participating. The answer is <strong>truth-seeking</strong>.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Democracy is only as strong as the willingness of people to go to the bottom of the “truth”.</em></strong></blockquote><p>If citizens don’t question assumptions, investigate claims, or look beyond the most entertaining narrative, democracy becomes vulnerable — not because people lack intelligence, but because <strong>human nature prefers comfort to complexity and there are not plenty of means to do so</strong>.</p><p>I am proposing a holistic platform that can support civilians to stay active, informed and respectful to their community.</p><p><strong>Thank you for reading!</strong><br />I’d love to connect and hear your views on how we can create the best possible experience for a platform like this.

<h4>In the quiet corners of our technological revolution, there is a crisis no one is naming. We are building systems designed to augment human capability whilst simultaneously dismantling the very expertise needed to govern them. This is not a story about job displacement. It is about a category of work we have not yet learnt to value.</h4><figure><img alt=""Circular diagram showing 7 Critical AI Roles: AI Decision Auditor, Multimodal Interaction Designer, AI Risk Steward, Responsible AI Implementation Strategist, AI Drift and Integrity Analyst, Transparency and Explainability Designer, and Human Accountability Architect, all centered around ‘Knowledge Positions’ emphasizing deep domain expertise and critical systems thinking"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tPZWLnosxOAj3797351SNQ.png"" /></figure><h3>The cake you cannot fix</h3><p>I often explain responsible AI development through baking. If you bake a cake with salt instead of sugar, you cannot fix it afterwards. You have to start over.</p><p>The metaphor lands because everyone understands <em>irreversibility</em>. Yet I keep meeting consulting firms and product teams, many in highly regulated sectors, who assume they can <em>retrofit</em> compliance later. Build fast, they say. Worry about transparency and accountability once the system works.</p><p><strong>They cannot.</strong></p><p>Most AI applications being developed today, especially those built on opaque foundation models with no visibility on data provenance, bias controls, or training processes, cannot be retrofitted to meet regulatory requirements. <a href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0206"">The EU AI Act</a> does not allow you to add documentation, traceability, and human oversight as afterthoughts. These must be baked into the architecture from the beginning.</p><p>The salt is already in the mixture. Organisations are only just beginning to taste it.</p><h3>The crisis in plain sight</h3><p>Whilst headlines obsess over which jobs AI will <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c07vmllz38jo"">eliminate</a>, something more consequential is happening. We are creating an entire ecosystem of AI systems with no one qualified to govern them: a recent study by <a href=""https://flur.ee/fluree-blog/for-ai-business-transformation-look-beyond-saas/"">Fluree</a> shows that the average enterprise runs an 367 (!) SaaS apps, most of which have AI integrated.</p><p>The issue isn’t that the technology is ungovernable, it’s that we’re not cultivating the expertise required to do the governing.</p><p>Think about what deploying a <a href=""https://www.euaiact.com/blog/high-risk-ai-systems-under-the-eu-ai-act"">high-risk AI</a> system actually requires. You need someone who can question whether the training data reflects reality or bias. Someone who can challenge whether the optimisation function aligns with human values. Someone who can monitor whether a model performing at 95% accuracy today has quietly degraded. Someone who can explain to a regulator, or an affected citizen, why the algorithm made the decision it did.</p><p>These are not technical problems. They are <em>judgement</em> problems.<br />And judgement cannot be automated.</p><p>Here is the paradox. AI has expertise without context. It can process patterns across vast datasets but cannot understand why or when that knowledge matters. It can identify correlations in historical hiring data but cannot tell you whether those correlations reflect meritocracy or structural discrimination. It can optimise for efficiency but cannot weigh the moral implications of sacrificing fairness to do so.</p><p>That gap between machine capability and human judgement is where the most important work of the next decade will happen.</p><h3>The roles we are not creating</h3><p>This crisis is not theoretical. It is already creating demand for a new category of roles. Roles that do not just manage AI, but ensure it serves human values.</p><p>Consider what <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor%E2%80%93network_theory"">Actor-Network Theory</a> has long taught us. AI systems are not neutral tools. They are embedded in networks of human actors, institutional power structures, regulatory frameworks, and social values. Governing AI is not just about managing algorithms. It is about navigating these complex, interconnected systems.</p><p>Seven distinct professional roles are emerging. Not technical positions requiring coding expertise. <em>Knowledge positions </em>requiring deep domain expertise, critical thinking, and systems thinking. The ability to see how changes in one part ripple through the whole.</p><p><strong>1. The AI Decision Auditor</strong> questions and validates AI before implementation. When a hiring algorithm rejects a candidate, someone must verify the logic was not simply reproducing historical discrimination. When a diagnostic tool recommends treatment, someone must ensure it did not hallucinate a correlation. The AI Act’s <a href=""https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/14/"">Article 14</a> requires human oversight for high-risk systems, but human oversight without the expertise to question is theatre, not governance.</p><p><strong>2. The Human Accountability Architect</strong> designs processes that preserve human responsibility even as systems become more autonomous. As multi-agent AI proliferates, accountability becomes genuinely unclear. Someone must ensure that when things fail, and they will, there is an answer to the regulator’s inevitable question. Who is responsible?</p><p><strong>3. The Multimodal Interaction Designer</strong> orchestrates how multiple AI agents collaborate with human oversight. Modern systems are ecosystems of agents, interfaces, and decision points that must work coherently. <a href=""https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/13/"">Article 13</a> requires transparency about how AI systems operate, but transparency means nothing if the experience is incomprehensible.</p><p><strong>4. The AI Risk Steward</strong> monitors systems for drift, degradation, and bias emergence. AI does not break loudly. It degrades quietly. Someone must watch for the silent erosion before damage compounds.</p><p><strong>5. The Responsible AI Implementation Strategist</strong> translates between technical teams, who build, and legal teams, who interpret, ensuring compliance is not theatre but embedded practice.</p><p><strong>6. The AI Drift and Integrity Analyst</strong> tracks model performance over time, identifying when systems produce unreliable results before regulatory audits discover the problem. <a href=""https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/72/"">Article </a>72’s post-market monitoring obligations assume someone is actually monitoring. Most organisations are not.</p><p><strong>7. The Transparency and Explainability Designer</strong> translates AI decision-making into understandable explanations. Technical accuracy means nothing if humans cannot comprehend it.</p><p>This roles are innovative in this form, but not new. For instance, most commercial aircraft have sophisticated autopilot systems. They can handle take-off, maintain altitude, navigate routes, even land in certain conditions. Yet no airline would dream of removing the pilots from the cockpit. No passenger would board a flight knowing there was no one able to take the controls.</p><p>Why? Because <em>automation</em> is not the same as <em>autonomy</em>. <br />Because systems fail in unexpected ways. Because edge cases require human judgement. Because someone must remain responsible.</p><p>AI systems are the same. These seven roles are the pilots in the cockpit. They do not fly the plane manually, but they remain essential. Monitoring, overriding when necessary, taking control when the automated systems encounter situations they were not designed to handle.</p><p>These roles all require human judgement to check, guide, and refine AI outputs. They cannot be performed by AI itself. That would be asking the algorithm to audit the algorithm.</p><h3>The illusion of competence</h3><p>But the crisis runs deeper than a lack of roles. It is also about the erosion of expertise, and the dangerous illusion that anyone can govern AI.</p><p>Consider the current enthusiasm for <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-vibe-coding"">vibe coding</a>. The idea that anyone can now build functional applications through natural language prompts, no programming knowledge required.</p><p>There is truth here. Barriers have lowered. But there is also a dangerous <a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/vibe-coding-is-the-new-open-source/"">fallacy</a>. We are conflating the ability to generate code with the expertise to evaluate whether that code is <a href=""https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/blog/vibe-coding-2025-risks/29613/"">fit</a> for purpose.</p><p>What happens when the AI <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-hallucinations"">hallucinates</a>? When it generates plausible-looking code with subtle security vulnerabilities? When it optimises for the wrong objective because the prompt was not precise enough?</p><p>The person with no coding expertise cannot spot these failures. They have outsourced not just the manual work of typing code, but the expertise required to recognise when the output is wrong.</p><p>We are creating a generation seduced by the illusion of capability without competence.</p><p>And what happens when the AI models disappear? Not because of some apocalyptic scenario, but simply because a service shuts down, a company pivots, a model becomes obsolete. If we have outsourced expertise to systems we do not understand, what knowledge remains?</p><p>Our <a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/when-deepware-meets-wetware-the-uncomfortable-truth-about-responsible-ai-245842121749"">wetware</a>, our brain, our lived experience, our ability to connect and contextualise knowledge, this is what makes us uniquely suited to ask the right questions for any given situation.</p><p>That cannot be delegated. It can only be cultivated.</p><h3>Two hundred and fifty files</h3><p>Now let me tell you something that should keep every AI executive awake at night.</p><p><a href=""https://www.anthropic.com/research/small-samples-poison"">Recent research by Anthropic</a>, in partnership with the <a href=""https://www.aisi.gov.uk/"">UK AI Safety Institute</a> and the <a href=""https://www.turing.ac.uk/"">Alan Turing Institute</a>, revealed that just 250 malicious files can compromise even the largest language models. A fraction so small, roughly 0.00016% of the training data, that it is effectively a rounding error.</p><p>Models ranging from 600 million to 13 billion parameters, systems trained on datasets so vast they would take human lifetimes to read, can be poisoned by a rounding error’s worth of corrupted data.</p><p><a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/data-poisoning"">Data poisoning </a>works by injecting malicious inputs, often indistinguishable from legitimate data, into a model’s training set. These inputs create hidden vulnerabilities like backdoors or biased outputs that only activate under specific conditions. A model might perform perfectly during testing, only to produce harmful outputs when it encounters a particular trigger phrase in production. Because the poisoning is subtle and the training datasets are vast, it evades detection until it is too late. By the time you discover the problem, the corruption is already baked into the model’s weights.</p><p>The assumption that bigger model equals safer model has collapsed.</p><p>And <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05566"">data poisoning</a> is already happening. Adversarial actors are already exploiting these <a href=""https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-data-poisoning"">weaknesses</a>. And most organisations deploying AI systems have no idea whether their training data has been compromised.</p><p>For every interface your design team polishes, for every user experience your product team optimises, there is an invisible substrate of risk embedded in the data that feeds your AI. You can make the chatbot delightful. You cannot make it trustworthy if the foundation is poisoned.</p><p>Training data hygiene matters far more than sheer computational scale. You can have billions of parameters and state-of-the-art architecture, but if 250 malicious documents made it into your training pipeline, you have built an expensive liability.</p><p>And here is what makes this discovery so devastating for the retrofit compliance later crowd. You cannot audit what you cannot see. You cannot fix what was baked into the model’s weights during training.</p><p>The salt is in the mixture. No amount of post-hoc filtering will extract it.</p><p>This is precisely why the seven roles I have outlined are not optional enhancements. They are the minimum viable governance for responsible deployment. The <em>AI Decision Auditor</em> who can question whether an unexpected output reflects genuine intelligence or a dormant trigger phrase. The <em>Human Accountability Architect</em> who ensures someone can be held responsible when a poisoned model makes harmful decisions. The <em>AI Risk Steward</em> who monitors for the subtle drift that signals data degradation.</p><p>Without these capabilities, you are deploying systems you cannot trust and defending against threats you cannot see.</p><p>Trust, in this context, is earned through design, not assumed by default.</p><h3>The investment we are not making</h3><p>Yet here is the reality. We are not investing in the next generation who will fill these custodial roles.</p><p>Organisations hesitate to hire junior staff because they expect roles to change. But that is precisely <em>why</em> we need them. What makes junior roles sustainable is not teaching people to use today’s tools. It is giving them solid theoretical and analytical grounding so they can adapt as tools evolve, challenge AI outputs with informed scepticism, and bring human judgement into the collaboration.</p><p>And universities? They are still teaching AI ethics as an elective, not a core competency. The ability to audit an algorithm for bias or design an accountability framework should be as fundamental as calculus for engineers, as essential as anatomy for doctors. Or we risk graduating a generation of builders with no guardians. <br />Instead, we are still producing graduates who can train neural networks but cannot explain why a model’s accuracy dropped, or what <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_(machine_learning)"">fair</a> even means in the context of algorithmic decision-making.</p><p>They certainly cannot identify the signs of data poisoning before it is too late.<br />Schools must treat AI governance as a core competency, not an afterthought. Courses should cover:</p><ul><li><strong>How to challenge algorithms, not just build them.</strong> Questioning the assumptions embedded in training data and optimisation functions. Understanding when correlation is not causation, when efficiency creates injustice, when accuracy masks harm.</li><li><strong>How to design accountability frameworks for sociotechnical systems.</strong> Grounded in both regulatory requirements like the AI Act and human-centred design principles. Students should graduate knowing how to trace decisions through complex systems, how to preserve human responsibility even as automation proliferates.</li><li><strong>Ethics and scenario modelling as core competencies.</strong> The ability to anticipate second-order effects and unintended consequences. To ask not just “can we build this?” but “should we?” and “what happens when this fails?”</li><li><strong>The distinction between legal compliance and moral responsibility.</strong> Between what systems <em>can</em> do and what they <em>should</em> do. Between meeting the letter of regulation and honouring the spirit of human dignity.</li><li><a href=""https://thesystemsthinker.com/systems-thinking-what-why-when-where-and-how/""><strong>Systems thinking</strong></a><strong> that recognises AI as part of complex networks.</strong> Involving human actors, institutional structures, and social contexts. How to conduct adversarial thinking, imagining how systems might be exploited and building defences before vulnerabilities are discovered in production.</li><li><strong>Provenance tracking and dataset auditing as foundational skills.</strong> Not specialised techniques reserved for security teams, but basic competencies for anyone working with AI. If you cannot trace where your training data came from, you cannot trust what your model produces.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Infographic titled “Emerging Skills for AI Governance: University Core Competencies.” At the center is a large purple circle labeled “AI Governance — Core Competency.” Six smaller purple circles surround it, each connected by white lines and paired with an icon.

Shaped by power, policy, and human judgement. Building AI without recognising this is not innovation. It is amnesia.</p><h3>What makes us irreplaceable</h3><p>Historically, physical labour gave way to intellectual work. Intellectual work is now giving way to oversight and accountability. We are becoming the moral anchors of a machine-operated world.</p><p>This pattern is not new. Every technological revolution creates categories of work that did not exist before. Not by eliminating human contribution, but by redefining what makes that contribution irreplaceable.</p><p>Consider <a href=""https://beyondthename.weebly.com/smith-mary.html"">Mary Smith,</a> the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knocker-up"">knocker-upper</a> who woke factory workers each morning. The alarm clock eliminated her profession. But it did not eliminate the need for humans in the <em>morning economy</em>. It simply shifted where human judgement mattered.</p><p>AI is following the same path. <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/when-machines-make-outputs-humans-must-own-outcomes-a9293109b3be?source=user_profile_page---------0-------------811a71ad6a5b----------------------"">Machines make outputs. Humans must own outcomes.</a></p><p>That is not poetic language. It is the legal and ethical line the AI Act draws.</p><p>The question is not whether these roles will exist. They are already emerging, driven by regulatory pressure, operational necessity, and the simple reality that 250 poisoned files can compromise billions of parameters.</p><p>The question is whether we will invest in developing the expertise to fill them before systems fail, reputations collapse, or regulators intervene.</p><h3>The choice before us</h3><p>So here we stand, at the intersection of human intelligence and artificial systems, facing a choice that organisations have not yet recognised as urgent.</p><p>Build responsible AI from the ground up, or waste resources building systems that cannot comply with regulation and cannot be trusted with high-stakes decisions. Cultivate the next generation of AI custodians, or outsource our collective future to algorithms with no one qualified to question them.</p><p>The future of responsible AI is not technical. It is <strong><em>human</em></strong>.</p><p>It requires investing in roles that blend deep domain expertise with critical thinking. It requires recognising that governance is not overhead but foundation. It requires remembering what centuries of technological evolution have demonstrated. Machines amplify human choices. They do not render those choices irrelevant. They make them more consequential than ever.</p><p>True innovation requires more than computational power. It demands wisdom.</p><h3>Where to start?</h3><p>If you are leading an organisation deploying AI systems, ask yourself these questions.</p><ul><li>Who in your organisation can challenge an algorithm’s reasoning before it affects real people? Not describe how it works technically, but question whether it should work that way at all.</li><li>Who is responsible when your AI system degrades and no one notices until the damage compounds?</li><li>Who will explain to a regulator, or to a person denied credit, employment, or healthcare, why the algorithm made the decision it did?</li><li>Who can identify whether 250 malicious files have compromised your training data before you have deployed a billion-parameter liability into production?</li></ul><p>If you cannot answer these questions with names and capabilities, you do not have an AI strategy. You have an AI experiment unfolding in production with no one steering it.</p><p>The seven roles outlined here are not future speculation. The AI Act has made them mandatory for high-risk systems. Market reality is making them essential for competitive advantage. And the simple mathematical fact that 0.00016% contamination can compromise the largest models has made them existentially urgent.</p><p>The salt is in the mixture. The only question remaining is whether you will recognise it before you serve the cake, or after your customers taste it.</p><h3>The guardians we choose</h3><p>The future of AI is not just about what machines can do. It is about what humans must <strong>become</strong>. The custodians of context. The challengers of logic. The guardians of <em>outcomes</em>.</p><p>Every algorithm carries within it the echoes of human decision-making. Our challenge is not to fear these technologies, but to consciously shape their ethical foundations. To invest in the people capable of doing that shaping.</p><p>If your organisation is not creating these roles today, you are not just falling behind. You are building a ticking time bomb. Because when systems fail, and they will, no one will ask what the algorithm decided. They will ask <strong><em>who</em></strong> was responsible for letting it decide.</p><p>The question is not whether you can afford to create these positions.</p><p>It is whether you can afford not to.</p><p>Consider the alarm clock that replaced Mary Smith’s profession. Not just a technological replacement, but a metaphor for human <a href=""https://pat-bertini.medium.com/when-machines-make-outputs-humans-must-own-outcomes-a9293109b3be"">adaptability</a>. Each technological shift does not eliminate human potential. It reshapes it.</p><p>Our deepest innovations emerge not from machines, but from the human capacity to reimagine possibility.</p><p>The future of AI will not belong to the coders alone.<br />It will belong to the guardians we choose to train.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=8c2664a452a3"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-salt-in-the-ai-cake-seven-emerging-jobs-no-one-is-preparing-for-8c2664a452a3"">The salt in the AI cake: seven emerging jobs no one is preparing for</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4><em>A case study on false affordance and the hidden costs of deceptive UI feedback.</em></h4><figure><img alt=""A playful illustration of a human figure whose body is shaped like a large bright-green checkmark.

Normally, I pride myself in being an organised traveler — I always check in online beforehand and download my boarding pass to my phone wallet so that I have less things to think about while at the airport.</p><p>This time, however, I couldn’t find my boarding pass. Naturally, I opened the airline’s app to download it again but realised it wasn’t there either. I scrolled through the app trying to find it but all I saw was a timeline with a series of steps, each of which had a reassuring green checkmark, including ‘check-in’.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FRGNvH05w64gXYCmY0V5VA.png"" /><figcaption>screenshot from the airline’s app (by author)</figcaption></figure><p>Weird, because I still couldn’t find the boarding pass. I kept tapping through every possible menu and spent a good few minutes hunting for it, feeling increasingly frustrated. Eventually, I admitted defeat and walked to the check-in desk, assuming I’d somehow missed the download step.</p><p>When I explained the situation, the airline clerk looked up my booking and told me I hadn’t checked in… so I pointed to the app and showed him the green checkmarks in protest. It mustn’t have been the first time this happened because the look he gave me was something in between understanding and pity, and then he told me to ‘read more carefully’.</p><p>Only then did I noticed the faint grey text under the checkmark: <em>“Online check-in is not available within three hours prior to the scheduled departure time. Please proceed to the airport check-in desk”.</em></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UMcqE9japCtr6JP8I5DE2w.png"" /><figcaption>Close up of the interface (by author)</figcaption></figure><p>Turns out that because I was within that three-hour window, online check-in had closed — and on top of that, I now had to pay a €48 late check-in fee.</p><p>Technically, the mistake was mine as I should have checked in earlier, and I didn’t. But from a design perspective, this isn’t really a user error, but truly just a poor UX pattern.</p><p>The interface communicates that “everything is done” when, in reality, the most critical action — checking in — has failed. The visual language of the app gives a false sense of completion, hiding essential information behind low-contrast text. In that moment, the design not only didn’t protect me from a mistake, but it actually led me into one.</p><h4>What went wrong in the UX</h4><p>A green checkmark is one of the most universal symbols in user interfaces. It signals completion and success. We’ve all been conditioned through decades of digital (and physical — think of traffic lights) feedback loops, to see green as <em>go</em>.</p><p>A checkmark, in particular, implies something is done, verified, safe or confirmed. It’s an unspoken design language, deeply ingrained in our <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mental-models/"">mental models</a>.</p><p>In the airline app, instead, the green checkmark simply indicated that the check-in step existed on the timeline. The visual design borrowed a cue that, in almost every other context, represents success — and reassigned it to something ambiguous and deceptive.</p><p>This is what makes it a <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/deceptive-patterns/"">dark pattern</a> in disguise: it exploits a learned expectation by telling the user “everything’s fine” when, in reality, a critical action has failed.</p><p>The issue is compounded by hierarchy and contrast as the grey message stating that online check-in had closed was way too easy to miss. From a usability perspective, low contrast can make text less readable and from a psychological one, it signals low importance. Our eyes naturally prioritise bold, high-contrast elements so it visually communicated that it could be ignored.</p><p>Moreover, the responsibility to <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/"">recover from error shouldn’t fall on the user</a> without necessary and helpful guidance, especially when caused by a limitation of the service (like in this case, being able to check-in online only within a specific window of time).</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lA_I1biI7HGjlaG0IDZeVg.png"" /><figcaption>green checkmark icon (<a href=""https://dribbble.com/shots/22837398-Checkmark-icon"">source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>What could seem like a small choice had a cascading cognitive effect especially when put into the real life context where this product is used: in the airport, rushing and overloaded with information, users most likely will rely on <a href=""https://www.intechnic.com/blog/how-to-use-pattern-recognition-and-perception-in-ux-design/"">pattern recognition</a>, not close reading, by scanning for affordances like colours and symbols.</p><p>But perhaps the biggest issue is about the misalignment between <a href=""https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/handling-state-and-state-management-system-design/"">system state</a> and user perception. The app <em>knew</em> I hadn’t checked in — it knew that the window for doing so had closed — and yet, it presented the interface as if everything was fine instead of guiding me toward resolution.</p><p>Good UX design should always acts as a bridge between system logic and user intention so that during errors it’s able to inform and remove friction, confusion, and ultimately, avoid a penalty.</p><h4>How This Could Be Designed Better</h4><p>What makes situations like this so frustrating is that they’re entirely preventable with a few basic human-centred design choices.</p><p>The first, and most obvious, is <strong>using visual language that reflects the system’s state</strong>. A green checkmark shouldn’t appear unless something is actually completed, a more honest interface would show the check-in step as pending or errored, making the blocked state immediately visible without requiring the user to read fine print.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*B4SJ4SslDu5S_zcXHCwatQ.png"" /><figcaption>Quick mock-up to illustrate how a simple change in icon and colour choice would already make a huge difference in user’s perception (by author)</figcaption></figure><p>Equally important is the <strong>hierarchy of information</strong>. In time-sensitive flows like travel, anything that prevents progress needs to be unmistakable. A message that the online check-in window has closed shouldn’t be styled like a secondary footnote. It should take visual priority, acknowledging that users in this context are scanning quickly, juggling attention and under stress.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_xx-HZzr6MamlNw9sswMVg.png"" /><figcaption>Quick mock-up to illustrate visual priority given to the system state (by author)</figcaption></figure><p>Another simple improvement would be proactive communication. I actually didn’t receive any notifications prior the closing time of the online check-in. The system knows when check-in closes and it certainly knows when a user hasn’t completed it yet, so it would be a given for the the app to notify the user before the cutoff. <strong>Time-based tasks </strong>are fundamentally different from static ones, and they <strong>demand a different level of visibility</strong>.</p><p>One important role for design is to be the bridge between system logic and human intention, and this interface is an example of how easy it is to make that bridge collapse. But it’s also a reminder that users don’t fail alone — they fail with the systems that are supposed to support them, so one of our goals is to always design with context and cognitive reality in mind to protect people in the moments when they’re most overloaded and least able to slow down.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=62a4637e49f7"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/when-the-dark-pattern-is-a-glaring-green-checkmark-62a4637e49f7"">When the dark pattern is a glaring green checkmark</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Perhaps, just like me, you’ve searched the internet for different sources about the Gestalt principles and found that there are many, each slightly different from the others. That’s why I decided to bring several of them together, analyze and group them, and highlight the fundamental ones, the core laws that we, as designers, can confidently rely on when creating our work.</p><p>But let’s start from the beginning, where these principles came from, and why they are, in fact, more of a science than just an observation.</p><h3>The History of Gestalt Principles</h3><p>Gestalt psychology emerged in Germany at the very beginning of the 20th century as a response to the then-dominant, and in fact the first, school of psychology — <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism_(psychology)"">Structuralism</a>. Structuralism viewed consciousness as something that could be deconstructed into individual elements: sensations, images, and feelings; to understand how the mind is built from its smallest parts.</p><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white portrait of a man with glasses, a full beard, and a serious expression, wearing a suit and white collar."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/274/0*StoYieZSdCa2uo0p.jpg"" /><figcaption>Edward Bradford Titchener (1867–1927) is founder of Structuralism — <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_B._Titchener#/media/File:Edward_B._Titchener.jpg"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology"">Gestalt psychology</a>, on the other hand, saw perception as an inherently holistic process: our consciousness emerges from the organization of those parts into meaningful wholes, but unlike structuralism, it does not attempt to view perception as the sum of its parts.</p><p>Where structuralism tried to analyze the structure of experience, Gestalt focused on the patterns that give experience its unity and sense.</p><p>The Gestalt principles we use in design today were first studied in their earliest form by Gestalt psychology founders <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Wertheimer"">Max Wertheimer</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_K%C3%B6hler"">Wolfgang Köhler</a>, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Koffka"">Kurt Koffka</a>. They explored and expanded upon each other’s work on how the human brain perceives visual images not as a collection of separate elements, but as unified, structured wholes. That’s where the term “Gestalt” comes from — the German word for “form” or “structure.”</p><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white portrait of a man with a beard and receding hairline, wearing a dark coat and posing with arms crossed against a dark background."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/256/0*-7bNwJ1VdkNU9UIm.jpg"" /><figcaption>Max Wertheimer (1880–1943) — <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Wertheimer#/media/File:Max_Werheimer_(1880-1943).jpg"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>The main idea was that the mind automatically organizes sensory information into meaningful forms, even when parts of the data are missing or distorted. Because of the growing popularity of psychology in the early days of marketing, these principles quickly became the foundation for understanding composition, object grouping, and visual hierarchy, concepts we still actively apply in interface design today.</p><p>Over the past hundred years, countless interpretations and variations of these laws and principles have been written and discussed. Originally, Max Wertheimer identified only nine principles, which he didn’t even call <em>“principles”</em> at the time. He referred to them as <em>“factors”</em> that determine how humans perceive groups of objects. It was only later that these factors were reformulated and became known as the Gestalt principles.</p><h3><strong>Why Gestalt is more than just observation</strong></h3><p>What made Gestalt psychology truly revolutionary was that it proved its claims through controlled experiments, not just philosophical speculation or introspection.</p><p>Max Wertheimer’s study of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_phenomenon"">phi phenomenon</a> was among the first to show that the mind can perceive movement where none exists: two still images flashing in sequence were seen as continuous motion. This finding demonstrated that perception is an active process of construction, not passive reception. And it is this principle that underlies animation and cinema, as well as, the transitions we create in design.</p><figure><img alt=""A sequence of twelve black-and-white photographs showing a horse and rider in motion, illustrating the phases of a gallop, with grid lines and the title “The Horse in Motion” by Eadweard Muybridge."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*70V1TnUbPL5pk-D1.jpg"" /><figcaption>The Horse in Motion by Eadweard Muybridge — <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=57260211"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Wolfgang Köhler’s <a href=""https://pigeon.psy.tufts.edu/psych26/kohler.htm"">experiments with apes</a> later reinforced the idea of grouping. Chimpanzees were placed in situations where food was visible but out of reach. Instead of relying on random trial and error, they would suddenly grasp how to combine available objects, for example stacking boxes or using a stick to solve the problem. Köhler called this moment of sudden understanding insight.</p><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white photo showing chimpanzees in an enclosure, with one climbing onto boxes and reaching upward toward an object while others look on or raise their arms."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/297/0*0Y1c0R3E0iZWFs0I.JPG"" /><figcaption>Photo from The Mentality of Apes — <a href=""https://pigeon.psy.tufts.edu/psych26/kohler.htm"">image source</a></figcaption></figure><p>That is precisely what happens in great UX. When an interface is well-designed, users don’t have to memorize steps or instructions; they see how things fit together. Their mental model of the system reorganizes itself into something coherent and intuitive. Good design, like Köhler’s insight, doesn’t teach but reveals.</p><p>Together, these and other first studies gave Gestalt psychology an empirical foundation, transforming it from a set of visual curiosities into one of the earliest scientifically validated theories of perception.</p><h3>Our focus for today</h3><p>For this article, we’ll focus on three modern interpretations of these principles, and original paper of Max Wertheimer, <a href=""https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Wertheimer/Forms/forms.htm""><em>Laws of Organization in Perceptual Forms</em></a>. Our other reference sources for today are:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles""><em>What are the Gestalt Principles?</em></a><strong> </strong>by<strong> Interaction Design Foundation </strong>(12 principles)<strong> </strong>is an excellent and by far the most comprehensive list I’ve come across, complete with clear examples not only through abstract visuals but also real interface designs. The article presents these principles in a more academic yet design-focused way, linking them directly to design thinking and practical application.</li><li><a href=""https://www.figma.com/resource-library/gestalt-principles/""><em>What are the Gestalt Principles?</em></a><strong> </strong>by<strong> Figma </strong>(11 principles) offers a concise yet accurate definition of the principles, with a strong focus on their visual aspect, without delving deeply into how they’re applied in UX contexts.</li><li><a href=""https://maze.co/blog/gestalt-principles/""><em>Gestalt Principles: A Guide to the Psychology Behind Stellar UX</em></a><strong> </strong>by<strong> Maze </strong>(10 principles)<strong> </strong>is a wonderful and engaging interpretation, featuring highly memorable abstract examples alongside a dedicated section that demonstrates how these principles manifest directly in interface design.</li></ul><p>I’ve noticed that the number of Gestalt principles often varies across different sources, ranging anywhere from six to twelve. By combining and comparing all four of the sources, I’ve distilled 16 Gestalt principles, which I’ve grouped into three distinct categories. It’s important to note that these are not all existing Gestalt principles interpretations but rather the ones most commonly found and applied within the information-driven UI/UX design context.</p><h3>Basic Gestalt principles of grouping</h3><p>These principles, in one form or another, appear across all four sources — with only minor variations in interpretation.</p><h4><strong>Proximity</strong></h4><p>Elements that are placed close to each other are perceived as related.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UJjgVzM1J_PNh5PESqGlYA.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Four circles form a group because they are evenly spaced and positioned close to one another, while three other circles are set apart and do not visually belong to any group.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> Two buttons in a modal window appear as one group, whereas a separate button stands visually independent from them. We can use this principle to categorize actions for example, the button on the left might <em>close</em> or <em>cancel</em> the modal, while the grouped buttons on the right could represent <em>Save</em> and <em>Delete</em>. In the first case, the user does not affect the content; in the second, either action directly modifies the information.</p><h4><strong>Similarity</strong></h4><p>Objects that share similar color, shape, or size are perceived as belonging to the same group.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*A9NOIvnyctmytyOMIqp8vg.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Four circles filled with a more saturated color stand out from the rest of the elements and are perceived as a single category.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> We apply this principle in UI design, for example, with CTAs in most apps or websites, all primary buttons share the same color and size, helping users instantly recognize them as elements of the same functional group.</p><h4><strong>Common fate</strong></h4><p>Elements that move in the same direction or manner are perceived as part of the same group.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BvA0wbiXYlDxtFQ3XugkKg.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> If we imagine the circles in motion, the two central circles moving together would naturally be perceived as belonging to a single category.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> A simple example of this is animated partner logos that automatically scroll in the same direction. They share a common movement, or quite literally, a common fate.</p><h4><strong>Continuity (or Continuation)</strong></h4><p>Our eyes naturally tend to follow a <strong>line or a directional flow</strong> when one is perceived.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0zYmJjKQlWQCk0rhmuuP7g.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We don’t see ten separate circles placed on the image. We see a smooth curved line formed by those circles.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> In this example, I removed the background from the navigation bar used in the <em>Similarity</em> example to show that we still perceive these elements as one continuous unit. Our visual system instinctively connects objects into lines or paths whenever possible.</p><h4><strong>Closure (Reification)</strong></h4><p>Our brain tends to perceive complete, unified shapes even when parts of them are missing.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4HwUUchtbiTxvOYDPOQGAQ.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Even if we “cut out” straight segments from a circle, we’ll still perceive it as a circle, our mind automatically fills in the gaps.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> This principle allows us to create elements using dotted or dashed outlines, such as drop zones for uploadsor outlined buttons, which the user still recognizes as complete, interactive shapes.</p><h4><strong>Symmetry and order</strong></h4><p>Symmetrical objects are naturally perceived as part of the same group. Symmetry also creates a sense of stability, balance, and harmony.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VLTiAhg5659nDeftcFR6Og.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Two groups of elements are arranged symmetrically and are perceived as belonging together.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> In my example, we automatically perceive the symmetrically aligned navigation items as a unified group. Menu points that are all assumed to be clickable in this context.</p><h4><strong>Parallelism</strong></h4><p>Elements that are positioned parallel to each other are perceived as related or part of the same group.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*llo-sPWpyVBYlnr8jwdMgQ.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Four lines made up of circles are perceived as two distinct groups of objects. It’s partly due to this very principle.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> Navigation menus often contain quite large elements with many items. In this case, we perceive three groups of elements within a dropdown menu because they’re arranged parallel to one another and perpendicular to the main navigation. This layout makes scanning much easier for the user than, for example, displaying one long list or aligning all items parallel to the main navigation, as often happens in secondary menus.</p><h4><strong>Common Region / Shared Area</strong></h4><p>Elements placed within the same visual container or area are perceived as a single group.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9hbTi5l2oLWebGotZjvcoA.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Even though all small circles are evenly spaced, we perceive them as two separate groups because they are enclosed within different areas.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> Buttons inside a modal window are perceived as part of the same group, while a navigation button (even if it has the same visual weight and is positioned on the same level) is perceived as belonging to another group, simply because it’s outside that shared visual region.</p><h4><strong>Prägnanz (Simplicity)</strong></h4><p>The brain tends to perceive simple, concise, and stable forms first.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9m5_JWItTB5yhbkE9G1T6A.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite the complex shape created using multiple circles and a glass-like effect, we primarily perceive it as one large circle.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> We structure page content into blocks because it makes scanning easier for the user. Instead of focusing on individual letters or images, the user first perceives the overall block structure. In my example, you can see a schematic of a video streaming page, where we instinctively recognize the main sections: navigation, video, recommendations, and description.</p><h4><strong>Focal point</strong></h4><p>An element that contrasts with its surroundings is the first to capture attention.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uyuSSw1LRepf8xfTLSuYsw.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A white circle stands out against the background of all other circles and becomes the primary focal element.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> In my example, there are two elements that contrast with the rest of the interface: the button and the hero image.</p><p>Contrast in UI isn’t defined by color alone; it’s important to remember that color itself has three attributes: Hue, Saturation, and Value/Brightness, each of which can influence perception differently. By adjusting any of these, you can shift the focal point of the design.</p><p>We can also create contrast through size and shape, as demonstrated by the hero image example.</p><h4><strong>Figure-Ground</strong></h4><p>We distinguish an object based on its contrast with the background.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uP7GsMzObz6J5VNISN7_kg.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p>Our brain constantly tries to interpret two-dimensional images as three-dimensional scenes. Almost all modern sources reference the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin_vase""><em>Rubin’s Vase</em> </a>optical illusion since Edgar Rubin’s research greatly influenced Max Wertheimer and Kurt Koffka, who were working on similar visual phenomena at the time.</p><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In my example, however, I decided to use simpler shapes to illustrate how our perception tends to arrange objects spatially. For instance, in a <strong>reversible/unstable</strong> type example, two semi-transparent circles overlap and whichever one you focus on appears to be in the foreground. But when one of the shapes becomes opaque, the perception becomes <strong>stable</strong>, because we can clearly identify which element is in front and which is behind.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> In my interface example, you can see list items that share the same background color as the page itself but stand out due to shadows. We often apply this same principle in modal windows, where the background is darkened to visually separate the active layer from the rest of the interface.</p><h4><strong>Connectedness</strong></h4><p>Elements that are visually connected are perceived as part of the same group.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gIe7bK8PVsFwLiGyStiSEg.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In my example, you see sixteen circles and it’s easy to identify eight of them as belonging to the same group because they are physically connected by a line.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> In design, we often apply this principle in steppers, forms, or as in my example in informational blocks that illustrate the stages of a process or present step-by-step instructions.</p><h3>How it actually works</h3><p>It’s also important to note that each of these principles can and often does work in combination with others. Even the simplest element, like a hyperlink, can serve as an example of a <strong>multimodal Gestalt</strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""Image demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CYrVDvlzy6LqCit1afzeUg.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p>In this example, several principles operate simultaneously, reinforcing one another:</p><ul><li><strong>Connectedness provides structure.</strong> The underline creates a visual link between all letters and elements.

And while they can be incredibly valuable and relevant for us as designers, they’re often left out of other summaries likely because they don’t deal with how we group elements, but rather with how we perceive and interpret entire visual compositions.</p><p>I’d also like to note that these principles partially overlap with some of the ones we’ve already discussed. Still, there are important differences between them though that’s probably a topic deserving its own separate article.</p><h4><strong>Emergence</strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Illusion demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*gpK5M3OYrEt-Wrdc.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles""><em>© Interaction Design Foundation</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>We perceive the overall shape before noticing the details.

We often encounter this principle in typography: no matter which typeface we choose, we can usually still read and understand the characters, unless the font becomes extremely stylized or abstract.</p><h3>The archaic roots of Gestalt principles</h3><h4><strong>Familiarity / Past Experience</strong></h4><p>The brain groups or interprets elements because it remembers the context in which they were previously encountered.</p><p>However, it’s important to note that even Max Wertheimer mentioned this principle in a special context, emphasizing that it’s not a primary law of organization, but rather a secondary factor that <em>can </em>influence perception.</p><blockquote>In some cases, past experience or familiarity may influence the perception of organization, but the primary laws of grouping remain independent of experience.</blockquote><blockquote>— Wertheimer, 1923</blockquote><p>For us as designers, “Familiarity” is not really a law of perception in its simplest interpretation, it aligns more closely with one of Jakob Nielsen’s <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/"">heuristic design principles</a>. In more complex frameworks, it becomes part of cognitive psychology, connecting to concepts such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model""><em>Mental model</em></a><em> and </em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance""><em>Affordance</em></a>.</p><h3>Gestalt principles as the grammar of visual design</h3><p>Let’s imagine interface design as a language. If color defines the tone of our message, Gestalt principles define its structure.</p><p>A designer who understands how the human brain groups, aligns, and interprets visual elements doesn’t just make things “look good” but builds meaning. Gestalt is what transforms shapes into hierarchy and flow.</p><p>These principles aren’t theories to debate. They became laws of perception we can rely on with confidence. But there’s always room to explore their interpretations and to experiment with how these principles interact, overlap, and sometimes even contradict one another.</p><p>That’s why I encourage everyone who cares about users and about design as a craft to keep experimenting with the old and exploring the new in the pursuit of creating truly delightful and unique design.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=c34d6772fc36"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/patterns-your-brain-cant-unsee-gestalt-psychology-in-design-c34d6772fc36"">Patterns your brain can’t unsee: Gestalt psychology in design</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

When it comes to gifting, the best fashion presents are the ones that get real use — not just admired in the closet. And while the classic “new coat for winter” is always a safe bet, pairing it with the perfect bag? That’s where things get personal (and <em>a lot</em> more exciting).<br /><br />This season, <a href=""http://dkny.com"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">DKNY</a> makes it easy to match every personality on your list with its lineup of trendy outerwear and handbags. Think a tailored wool coat and structured tote for the minimalist who lives by a neutral palette, a belted plaid jacket and bold chain bag for the friend with an It-girl sensibility, or a snuggly sherpa and slouchy shoulder bag for the cozy queen whose entire personality revolves around soft, plush pieces. <br /><br />Whether you’re shopping for a ‘90s die-hard, a downtown-cool type, or someone who simply loves a good outerwear moment, consider this your shortcut to gifting something that’ll actually get worn (and photographed) all season long.<figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11943132.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><h2>For The Minimalist<br /></h2><br />Clean, classic, and all about quiet luxury — this pairing could’ve stepped right out of a ’90s style moodboard. The tailored gray wool coat brings timeless structure, while the chunky chain bag adds that touch of city sleek. Perfect for the friend whose wardrobe is mostly black, beige, or any perfected neutral.<br /><br /><strong>DKNY</strong> Single Breasted Wool Coat, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dkny.com%2Fproducts%2Fdl3mwm95clgy%3F_pos%3D1%26_sid%3D255455930%26_ss%3Dr%3Futm_source%3DRefinery29%26utm_medium%3DDisplay%26utm_campaign%3DAssembly_UpperFunnel_Display_Refinery29%26utm_content%3DAssembly_UpperFunnel_Views_HO25_Refinery29_Display"">DKNY</a><br /><br /><strong>DKNY</strong> Riona Flap Crossbody, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dkny.com%2Fproducts%2Fr54edo11c01s%3F_pos%3D2%26_sid%3D7fa88bb9f%26_ss%3Dr%3Futm_source%3DRefinery29%26utm_medium%3DDisplay%26utm_campaign%3DAssembly_UpperFunnel_Display_Refinery29%26utm_content%3DAssembly_UpperFunnel_Views_HO25_Refinery29_Display"">DKNY</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11943133.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><h2>For The Cozy Queen<br /></h2><br />She’s the one who owns at least eight loungewear sets and believes coffee runs count as an outing. This snuggly sherpa coat with buckle details delivers full-on plush energy (essentially doubling as a fleece blanket), while the slouchy chain bag adds just enough edge to balance softness with structure. It’s that irresistible mix of tactile and cool — cozy textures paired with sleek hardware that make every errand feel considered.<br /><br /><strong>DKNY</strong> Zip Sherpa Jacket with Buckle Collar, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dkny.com%2Fproducts%2Fdl5mfy19c07h%3F_pos%3D1%26_sid%3D8123b9304%26_ss%3Dr%3Futm_source%3DRefinery29%26utm_medium%3DDisplay%26utm_campaign%3DAssembly_UpperFunnel_Display_Refinery29%26utm_content%3DAssembly_UpperFunnel_Views_HO25_Refinery29_Display"">DKNY</a><br /><br /><strong>DKNY</strong> Fiona Small Hobo, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dkny.com%2Fproducts%2Fr54can85c01s%3F_pos%3D1%26_sid%3D3fcd95ac1%26_ss%3Dr%3Futm_source%3DRefinery29%26utm_medium%3DDisplay%26utm_campaign%3DAssembly_UpperFunnel_Display_Refinery29%26utm_content%3DAssembly_UpperFunnel_Views_HO25_Refinery29_Display"">DKNY</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11943134.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><h2>For The It-Girl<br /></h2><br />If her FYP and IG saves are all street style snaps, this combo was made for her. The longline white puffer somehow delivers both unparalleled warmth *and* style. Offset the cozy outer layer with sleek accoutrements, like stirrup leggings, stilettos, and a chic tote with beautiful knotted detailing. This enviable blend of relaxed and refined gives “effortless,” despite totally being thought out.<br /><br /><strong>DKNY</strong> Silky Long Quilted Parka, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dkny.com%2Fproducts%2Fdlsmpv41cpearl%3F_pos%3D2%26_sid%3D2538a847b%26_ss%3Dr%3Futm_source%3DRefinery29%26utm_medium%3DDisplay%26utm_campaign%3DAssembly_UpperFunnel_Display_Refinery29%26utm_content%3DAssembly_UpperFunnel_Views_HO25_Refinery29_Display"">DKNY</a><br /><br /><strong>DKNY</strong> Paula Small Commuter Tote, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dkny.com%2Fproducts%2Fr53bam60cbgd%3F_pos%3D2%26_psq%3DSMALL%2BPAULA%2BCOMMUTER%26_ss%3De%26_v%3D1.0%3Futm_source%3DRefinery29%26utm_medium%3DDisplay%26utm_campaign%3DAssembly_UpperFunnel_Display_Refinery29%26utm_content%3DAssembly_UpperFunnel_Views_HO25_Refinery29_Display"">DKNY</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11943135.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><h2>For The Refined Maximalist<br /></h2><br />She never met a color she didn’t love — especially when it’s oversize <em>and</em> tactile. This rich Bordeaux duo is plush, dramatic, and imbued with Main Character Energy. The monochrome palette makes it the ultimate throw-on-and-go outfit that somehow feels elevated and styled to perfection (even if she's out the door in five minutes).<br /><br /><strong>DKNY</strong> Faux Teddy Fur Jacket, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dkny.com%2Fcollections%2Fouterwear%2Fproducts%2Fdl5mfw97c69%3Futm_source%3DRefinery29%26utm_medium%3DDisplay%26utm_campaign%3DAssembly_UpperFunnel_Display_Refinery29%26utm_content%3DAssembly_UpperFunnel_Views_HO25_Refinery29_Display"">DKNY</a><br /><br /><strong>DKNY</strong> Medium Paula Commuter Tote, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dkny.com%2Fproducts%2Fr42bae49cawn%3F_pos%3D2%26_psq%3DPAULA%2BCOMM%26_ss%3De%26_v%3D1.0%3Futm_source%3DRefinery29%26utm_medium%3DDisplay%26utm_campaign%3DAssembly_UpperFunnel_Display_Refinery29%26utm_content%3DAssembly_UpperFunnel_Views_HO25_Refinery29_Display"">DKNY</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11943136.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><h2>For The Athluxe Lover<br /></h2><br />She’s the friend who always makes leggings look intentional. This glossy puffer nails the balance of form and function, while the metallic silver tote reflects her sporty-but-luxe sensibility — practical at heart, but with an eye for shine.

<p>Every year, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-clothes-accessories-2025"">winter fashion</a> is defined by a handful of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2025-trends"">specific prints</a>. Lighthearted <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-gingham"">gingham gives way</a> to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-fall-midi-dresses"">complex plaid</a>, with its crisscross of graphic lines and harmonious colours, while playful florals are replaced by more serious herringbone and houndstooth. This winter, however, one print is taking over everything. Enter: argyle — and it’s coming for your manicure, too.</p>



<h2>What are argyle sweater nails?</h2>



<p>With overlapping diamonds and clever use of negative space, argyle occupies a cozy space between harlequin and plaid. Inspired by the tartan of Scotland’s Clan Campbell, it’s a classic winter knit, but this season it’s bigger than ever, popping up everywhere from Zara to Sandro. It was only a matter of time before manicurists drew from the pattern. Head to Instagram, and you’ll see that the biggest nail art trend this winter is, in fact, argyle. </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/chummy.nails/?hl=en"">Oksana Zavora</a>, a Milan-based creative nail artist, is one professional who has been inundated with likes and comments since fashioning <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRFHfNbDK5h/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">this set</a> for content creator <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sarahbrezel/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sarah Stasi</a>. “Trendy nail designs are definitely influenced by fashion trends,” she tells Refinery29, “so this one already felt like an obvious success from the start.”</p>



<p>Zavora adds, “No matter the season, my color palette often naturally leans toward browns and those cozy ‘fall’ shades, so when my client came in with screenshots of argyle sweaters, I instantly knew it would turn into something amazing.”</p>

<h2>How do you create the argyle sweater nail trend?</h2>



<p>Unless you consider yourself a dab hand with a nail art brush, this one is best left to the professionals. “When you create designs completely from scratch, the most important part is trusting the process,” says Zavora. In other words, you just have to let your nail tech wing it. Oh, and gel polish — cured after each step — is your best bet to keep the colours crisp and long-lasting. </p>



<p>The graphic lines are probably the trickiest detail to perfect. To create the black and white stripes on her clients’ nails, Zavora says she first drew a dark line across the nail, then hand-painted the white stitches on top to mimic the fuzzy texture of a sweater. </p>

<p>On her recent argyle manicure, Zavora says, “I’m super nerdy about details, and I’m always focused on perfecting the final result, so this set was definitely a fun challenge! A lot of lines, layering of colors and shapes, some patience, and voilà — argyle nails.”</p>



<p>If Instagram is anything to go by, the argyle nail trend is set to blow up this winter. Here’s all the inspiration you’ll need for your next salon visit.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/paris-fashion-week-haircut-trends-spring-summer-2026"">From haircuts</a> to skincare, I change my mind as often as the wind — but one thing that’s stayed constant in my beauty routine over the past few years is my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nails-gel-acrylic-manicure-burning-pain"">biweekly manicure</a>, where I always opt for builder in a bottle gel (aka BIAB).</p>



<p>As a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nail-biting-best-strengthening-products"">former nail-biter,</a> I never imagined I could have <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/short-nail-beds-beauty-standards"">elegant nail beds</a> or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/latina-girlhood-acrylic-nail-art"">long nails</a> worthy of compliments, but BIAB, specifically <a href=""https://thegelbottle.us/biabtm-shop-all"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The GelBottle’s builder gel</a>, has made it entirely possible. And while BIAB is far more durable than other <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/regular-nail-polish-vs-gel-manicure-benefits"">gel polishes</a>, it doesn’t make me immune to the occasional <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grow-long-strong-nails-expert-advice"">chip, bend, or break </a>once my nails grow past a certain point — especially since I insist on using them as tools. How else is a lazy girl supposed to open her packages?</p>



<p>It’s as if the nail gods heard my dilemma, though, because this month The GelBottle unveiled <a href=""https://thegelbottle.us/hard-biabtm"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hard BIAB</a>, its strongest builder gel formula yet. I was among the first beauty journalists to try it, and here’s why I’m recommending it to everyone I meet.</p>

<h3>What is Hard BIAB and what are the benefits?</h3>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/daisykalnina/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Daisy Kalnina</a>, founder of The GelBottle Inc., says Hard BIAB boasts the same easy application and self-leveling formula (for a professional-looking, smooth, and even finish), but is designed to be much more rigid and durable. “It’s a hybrid gel that combines the strength of a traditional hard gel with the simplicity of BIAB,” adds Kalnina, “so if you want serious length, whether that’s growing out your natural nails or doing sculpted extensions, this is what you need.”</p>



<h3>What’s the difference between BIAB and Hard BIAB?</h3>



<p>While regular BIAB is stronger than your standard gel polish, it still allows short- to medium-length nails some flexibility. Hard BIAB does exactly what it says on the tin; it’s tougher and more solid, perfect if you want to grow your nails long but find they just keep breaking. “It’s for clients with a really hands-on lifestyle or anyone who wants to push their nail length further than they’ve been able to before,” says Kalnina.</p>



<p>The application process is exactly the same. I went to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lunaandwilde/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Luna and Wilde</a> in London, where pro nail artist Georgia applied a bond base straight to my natural nails, followed by a thin slip layer of the shade Bonnie before curing. To create an apex for strength and shape, she then applied another bead of Bonnie, building structure while forming the perfect curve. We both remarked on how good my nails looked afterward!</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11943177.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>Happily, Hard BIAB is available in twelve shades to suit all skin tones, including tried-and-true favorites like Dolly (a demi-sheer baby pink), Teddy (a rose taupe), and Bonnie (a strawberry milkshake pink), which is what I chose.</p>



<p>Just like regular BIAB, Hard BIAB can be filled. One key difference is the removal process: while regular BIAB can be soaked off in ten minutes, Hard BIAB must be filed off, either with a rough emery board or an e-file, thanks to its more durable structure. If you ask me, it’s more like a hard gel, which also requires filing. When I went to have mine removed at my local salon, they tried soaking it off with acetone, to no avail. You’d just be wasting your time. Kalnina recommends booking a fresh set every three to four appointments to keep an eye on the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nail-greenies-pseudomonas-infection-biab-gel"">health of your natural nails</a> underneath.</p>

<h3>Is Hard BIAB better than traditional BIAB?</h3>



<p>I usually get my nails filled every two weeks to prevent BIAB from lifting or my nails from growing so long that they chip or split at the sides. With Hard BIAB, though, I stretched it out to three and a half weeks. Honestly, I’ve never had longer or stronger nails. Even when they softened in the shower, I didn’t have to worry about bending them backward — a truly cringe-worthy feeling. I could also swear that, applied in layers, this new formula caused fewer — if any—heat spikes, where your nails feel uncomfortably hot under the UV lamp.</p>



<p>To be doubly sure, I went back to regular BIAB to compare, and my nails feel a little more pliable in comparison. Don’t get me wrong — they’re still strong, but nothing beats the comfort blanket of Hard BIAB. I’m sold and have already DM’d my salon to call in the entire range of Hard BIAB shades to keep me in nails.</p>



<h3>Where can I get Hard BIAB and how much does it cost?</h3>



<p>If your current nail salon already offers The GelBottle’s BIAB range, just give them a nudge to upgrade to the Hard versions. One-shade BIAB manicures on natural nails typically start at $40 to $60, though prices vary from salon to salon.</p>

<p>With Turkey Day just around the corner, I’ve been busy saving the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fall-2025-nail-manicure-trends"">cutest fall nail designs</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glass-french-nails-manicure-trend"">trending textures</a> that will lend themselves perfectly to the occasion. Whether it’s a colorblock manicure in the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/guava-nails-manicure-trend"">shades of the season</a> or a more intricate design to honor the holiday itself, these 13 ideas are festive without feeling cheesy. </p>



<p>And most importantly, whether you’re dressing up in your finest or chilling in your sweatpants, there’s a nail design to vibe with whatever Thanksgiving you’re having this year. </p>

<p>Argyle is the sweater pattern of the season — just ask the fashion set. We love this diamond-emblazoned design by Chummy Nails, which combines chocolate hues with cherry reds and fall-inspired leafy tones.</p>

<p>Brown nails are one of the biggest fall trends for 2024 and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thenaillologis"">Marnie’s</a> decision to pair this beautiful chestnut color with a minimalist leaf design and shimmering flecks of gold is inspired.  </p>

This cat-eye manicure created by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/beautybyelee/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Eleanor Szejner</a> is packed with perfect fall tones, from deep copper and burnished brown to pumpkin orange and rose gold. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11942892.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Get ready to rock ‘n’ roll! The second <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-moon-in-libra-horoscope-october-2025-meaning-effects"">New Moon of fall</a> occurs on November 19 Pacific time and November 20 Eastern time. The Scorpio New Moon is a rollercoaster of raw emotions and intensity. Prepare for the drama by meditating and cleaning our auras to ensure we aren’t negging 24/7. <br /><br />Hate to break it to you, but the New Moon in Scorpio is not going to be a walk in the park. It is a sensitive time that is asking us to mend our spirit through acts of self-acceptance. This lunation aspects seven planets, five of which are moonwalking in the sky — wowza! They are: the Sun, Moon, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrograde in Scorpio</a>, Jupiter retrograde in Cancer, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/saturn-retrograde-in-aries-and-pisces-horoscope-july-2025-meaning-effects"">Saturn retrograde in Pisces</a>, Uranus retrograde in Taurus, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/neptune-retrograde-in-aries-pisces-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Neptune retrograde in Pisces</a>. Before we freak out from the cosmos, let’s put this all together so we can understand what to expect. </p>



<p>Obviously, all these planets moonwalking in water signs will push us to be in our feelings and longing for the past. We may decide to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/getting-back-together-relationship-ex-partner"">connect with exes </a>and old school friends to take a stroll down memory lane. Looking backward is ideal, if we are trying to heal. However, we must proceed with caution and care. Although our hearts will yearn for the chance to rekindle these relationships, we must protect ourselves to ensure we don’t get hurt again. There is a tenderness lingering in the air that requires gentleness. If people can’t give us that sentiment, we must focus on harnessing that emotion for ourselves. </p>



<p>Of course, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uranus-retrograde-gemini-taurus-september-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Uranus’s retrograde</a> has a challenging vibe because it opposes the Sun, Moon, and Mercury retrograde. The Sun’s alignment to Mercury retrograde creates “cazimi,” bringing truths to light. We are going to be shaken to the core by a big reveal. It’s important to note that the clandestine information we receive could be about politics or pop culture — it doesn’t necessarily guarantee we’re the hot topic. Pay attention to the news cycle that begins under this new moon because it will make headlines in the next several weeks. Personally, the need for security might force us to look inward and meditate on what makes us happy. As the saying goes, “out with the old and in with the new.” The same applies to securing our financial bag — implement a budget, focus on necessities, and set limits. </p>



<p>Later, Uranus and Neptune retrograde dance, make a little love, and get down to our desires (when they formally link up). Significant shifts bring us closer to our innermost visions, helping us tune into our goals. Being that both of these planets are retrograde, we may want to reassess former aspirations that were left on the back burner to find our way. Revisit the hopes and objectives from years ago to firmly plant our feet in the ground and make plans (which will be subject to revision because of the retrogrades). Journaling the steps could be a great asset to ensure we remain on task. </p>



<p>The day before the New Moon, on November 19, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-scorpio-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Venus in Scorpio</a> harmonizes with the Nodes of Destiny, allowing us to comprehend the romantic and financial possibilities that lie ahead. As a result, we are deciding who and what we are thinking about committing to. It may be confusing and frustrating, but it gives us a sense of where we are heading. <br /><br />It would be remiss not to mention that the asteroid Lilith and Black Moon Lilith are in orbit with the degrees of the New Moon, adding fierceness to the events that will unfold. We are unleashing our darker and edgier sentiments, unapologetically letting our shadow selves be seen. We are tired of being swept to the sidelines and ignored. The upside of anger is that it can motivate us to take action that sparks change. So, be mad if you want to. Just use it to dismantle outdated institutions, practices, belief systems, and theories — not to cause irreparable harm to those we care about and ourselves. </p>



<p>The New Moon in Scorpio is going to be a wild ride. Be kind to yourself and others to swim through the deep and turbulent waters. Going with the flow could sweep us up in a sea of ambiguity, so keep one foot on the ground as an anchor. Remember, emotions and relationships are complex. Don’t hold yourself to a standard or mindset because everything is in a state of evolution.</p>

<p>Cosmic beings, welcome to the grand finale of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio season</a>… and it’s not going out quietly. This week, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrogrades back into Scorpio</a> on the 18th, joining Venus and the Sun in this emotionally raw, fiercely transformative water sign. With so many planets swimming through the shadows, don’t be surprised if your inner world feels louder than usual. Conversations may rewind to long-forgotten truths, secrets might slip, and connections — especially romantic or financial — could deepen or dissolve. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-scorpio-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Venus in Scorpio</a> craves intimacy with a capital “I,” and Mercury’s return here suggests the Universe is giving us one last chance to revisit what was left unsaid. <br /><br />Meanwhile, from November 17 to 19, the Moon disappears from the sky. This is the dark moon phase: the quiet, liminal space before a new beginning. It’s a cosmic cocoon that invites stillness, surrender, and deep emotional excavation. Old insecurities, shadow selves, and fears may surface during this time, not to punish you, but to be witnessed, embraced, and alchemized. If you find yourself overthinking, oversleeping, or even crying unexpectedly this week, you’re not broken… you’re unraveling. This is the fertile soil where your next version takes root. </p>



<p>The Scorpio New Moon arrives on November 20, offering us a powerful collective reset. This lunation is your chance to transmute pain into power. Scorpio teaches us that endings make space for beginnings, and this new moon is a portal to rise from the ashes. Set intentions around healing, emotional truth, sensual liberation, and regenerative growth. Whether you’re letting go of a past version of yourself or calling in a new one, this new moon whispers: <em>you are the storm, and you are the calm after it</em>. Prepare to emerge cleansed, reawakened, and ready for Sagittarius season’s fire. <br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>You’re no stranger to intensity, Aries, but this week’s Scorpio cauldron is bubbling <em>extra hot</em>. With the Sun, Venus, and (starting the 18th) Mercury all activating your sector of emotional bonds, vulnerability, and energetic entanglements, you may feel like you’re walking around with a lie detector strapped to your chest. Under this Scorpionic haze, secrets get whispered through dreams, eye contact, or accidental texts. Venus is dialing up your sensual magnetism, but she’s also pulling you into deeper questions: who do you trust with your body, your story, your money, your fears? Mercury retrograde here isn’t subtle either… it’s a cosmic exorcism, and you’re being asked to <em>feel</em> your way through instead of force clarity. </p>



<p>Then comes the real underworld reset: the Scorpio New Moon on November 20. This one hits different because it’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/boss-zodiac-sign-personality-meaning"">ruled by </a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/boss-zodiac-sign-personality-meaning"">your</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/boss-zodiac-sign-personality-meaning""> planetary boss Mars</a>, currently adventuring through Sagittarius and pumping you with courage, faith, and a hunger for reinvention. Between November 20 to 30, set intentions around transforming your relationship to intimacy, power, and truth. You’re not meant to stay bonded to people or patterns that drain your magic. Let yourself grieve, release, and then get free. This is your phoenix moment. Yes, it may sting. But you’ve outgrown your old ashes, babe, and Mars is guiding you to rise with humor, passion, and just the right amount of chaos. Trust that. </p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>This week’s Scorpio energy has you in a <em>deep soul gaze</em> with your connections, Taurus, and I mean <em>deep deep</em>, like “what are we really doing here?” levels. With the Sun, Venus (your cosmic ruler), and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrograde</a> all highlighting your relationship sector, things are feeling both intense and deliciously mysterious. One minute you’re like, “I could marry them,” and the next, you’re spiral-texting your bestie like, “wait… do they even like me?” This week is asking you to look beneath the surface of your partnerships, your agreements, and even your patterns. Venus wants harmony, yes, but in Scorpio? She wants <em>honesty</em>. If it’s fake peace, she’ll burn it down. </p>



<p>And then there’s that epic Scorpio New Moon on November 20, activating your rebirth in love. Whether it’s a relationship with someone else or with yourself (or honestly, both), this is your chance to wipe the emotional slate clean and choose deeper alignment. Mars in Sag is pushing you to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/living-for-the-plot-dating-adventure-travel"">stop playing it safe</a> — especially when it comes to how much you <em>really</em> share, how open you let yourself be, and how fearless you are in choosing passion over obligation. Set intentions this week that are rooted in <em>truth</em>, not fantasy. Trust that real love, whether romantic, platonic, or spiritual, can handle the heat. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>This final week of Scorpio season is turning your daily life into a bit of a pressure cooker, Gemini, but like, in a “this is forcing me to grow” kind of way. With the Sun, Venus, and retrograde Mercury (your ruler) all spotlighting your sector of routine, health, and systems, you may feel hyper-aware of what’s draining you vs. what’s sustaining you. Little things you’ve been brushing aside (like that lingering cough, that glitchy calendar, or that coworker you secretly loathe) could suddenly feel like cosmic emergencies. This isn’t a punishment… it’s your chance to clean house. Venus wants you to fall back in love with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/self-care-ideas-rituals"">your rituals</a>, while retro Mercury is like, “btw, here’s the mess under the rug.” Own it. Rework it. You’re not behind — you’re in a period of profound refinement. </p>



<p>By the time the Scorpio New Moon hits on November 20, you’re being invited to completely reimagine how you tend to your mind, body, and spirit. What does it <em>actually</em> mean to feel balanced, energized, and emotionally clean? This lunation’s giving detox, but like, the soulful kind. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Mars in Sagittarius</a> (your opposite sign) is stirring up momentum through partnerships — whether romantic or professional — so accountability is key. Set intentions to create supportive rhythms, clear communication channels, and sacred boundaries. You don’t have to do everything alone, but you do need to do what’s <em>aligned</em>. Trust your gut — it’s louder than your mind this week. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, the final week of Scorpio season is activating your pleasure sector with the intensity of a dramatic love letter, and yes, you’re both the writer <em>and</em> the muse. With the Sun, Venus, and now retrograde Mercury all huddled together in your realm of romance, creativity, and self-expression, it’s giving sexy rebirth. That project you abandoned? The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/situationships-dating-fulfilling-2"">situationship</a> you thought was over? The artistic impulse that felt too indulgent? All of that’s back for review, but not for chaos… for refinement. Your inner child is knocking and your inner lover is whispering. Be true to your heart’s desires. </p>



<p>The Scorpio New Moon on November 20 is a call to rise from the ashes of your old joy habits. What used to excite you but no longer fits? What desires feel dangerous but divine? With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Mars</a> (the ruler of the new moon) currently in Sagittarius, fueling your sector of wellness and devotion, the next six months are about sustaining your pleasure, not just chasing it. Set intentions that let joy be your compass <em>and</em> your strategy. You don’t need to apologize for craving beauty, sensuality, or spotlight. You just need to trust the parts of you that want to shine. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio season</a> is lighting a match in your roots sector and asking, “You sure you want to keep hiding that?” With the Sun, Venus, and now retrograde Mercury digging into your inner world, you may find yourself unpacking long-held secrets, family patterns, or private memories that still hold weight. This isn’t about spiraling… it’s about seeing things clearly. Venus wants softness, retro Mercury brings the receipts, and the Scorpio Sun is like, “Let’s transmute this into art, therapy, or both.” You’re being asked to feel what you’d rather skip. Let the deeper emotions come up, and let them move through you. Healing isn’t always loud — but it is potent. </p>



<p>When the Scorpio New Moon arrives on November 20, you’re being handed a blank page for rewriting your roots. What do safety and home <em>actually</em> look like to you now — not just what you were taught? The next six months are about defining that for yourself and planting seeds that honor your emotional truth. With your ruler the Sun still in Scorpio for a final week and Mars in Sag blazing through your play zone, don’t be afraid to fight for joy, even in the shadows. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-zodiac-sign-2025"">Set intentions</a> around reclaiming softness, embracing vulnerability, and building a sanctuary that reflects <em>your</em> soul. </p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You’re not imagining it, Virgo: conversations feel heavier, glances more loaded, and even silence carries meaning. That’s the final week of Scorpio season activating your sector of communication and perception, and with Venus and retrograde Mercury (your ruler) joining the Sun there, you’re being called to read between the lines <em>and</em> speak from the depths. You’re rewriting mental scripts that have kept you small or overly cautious. The way you talk to yourself? Under review. The way you <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-communicate-argument-relationship"">let others speak to you</a>? Getting a major upgrade. This week isn’t about rushing to respond; it’s about finally <em>hearing</em> what your soul’s been trying to say. </p>



<p>When the Scorpio New Moon arrives on November 20, the pages of your inner journal feel charged with spells. What truths do you want to claim out loud? What ideas are begging for form? With Mars in Sag heating up your foundations sector, this isn’t about pretty words, but rather about anchoring them. You’re planting seeds in your voice, your mindset, and the way you connect to those closest to you. Speak like the future you is listening. Because they are. </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Money, worth, and what you refuse to beg for are the themes this final week of Scorpio season is dredging up, Libra. And with retrograde Mercury and your ruler Venus both in Scorpio, activating your value sector, it’s time to examine not just your finances, but the deeper beliefs <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/low-self-esteem-spending-money"">fueling your sense of “enoughness.”</a> You’re being asked to shift from “What can I get?” to “What do I <em>deserve</em>?” This isn’t a week to undersell, overgive, or people-please your way into crumbs. Your magic is currency and your time is gold, so let that reframe how you ask, spend, save, and receive. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Scorpio New Moon on November 20 invites you to reset your relationship with wealth and self-esteem alike. What new habits, rates, or rituals would help you feel more rooted in abundance? What old stories around scarcity are ready to be composted? With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Mars in Sag</a> now energizing your expression and visibility sector, the Universe wants you seen, compensated, and celebrated — but you have to claim it. Set intentions that treat your worth as non-negotiable. </p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You’ve been walking through fire with grace, Scorpio, and this week the ashes start to shimmer. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio season</a> is reaching its final chapter, and you’re no longer the version of you who whispered affirmations hoping they’d stick. You’re the one who <em>knows</em>. Who’s been watching yourself alchemize in real time. Who’s bled, cried, purged, stayed silent, screamed out loud — and still showed up. And now, the Universe wants to know: Are you ready to live like you survived it? Are you ready for your thriving era? </p>



<p>Mercury retrograding into your sign starting the 18th may stir the ghosts one last time, bringing up old lovers, doubts, “almosts” and “should haves.” But remember: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-scorpio-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Venus in Scorpio</a> is here too, wrapping you in beauty, magnetism, and truth. You don’t have to armor up to feel worthy, and you don’t have to be ultra mysterious to be respected. You are worthy <em>now</em>, in your clarity, in your softness, in your voice that’s trembling but still choosing to speak. </p>



<p>The Scorpio New Moon on November 20 is your personal renaissance. It’s a cosmic mirror asking: Who do you dare to become if you stop hiding from your own power? If you drop the need to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/11/8894550/why-dont-people-like-me"">control how others receive you</a>, and just embody your essence fully, audaciously, and unapologetically? This is Phoenix energy — pure rebirth. Shed the last of what you’ve outgrown. Grieve it, kiss it, release it, and then rise into your next timeline with a body that remembers, a spirit that’s wiser, and a gaze that sees beyond illusions. This is the week it all changes for the better, Scorpio. The week you’ve been ready for. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, this final stretch of Scorpio season feels like a spiritual prelude… like the air right before a thunderstorm, thick with omens and revelations. With Mercury and Venus both moving through your sector of healing and closure, you’re being guided to listen to what you haven’t said out loud yet: the unspoken dreams, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/biggest-fears-zodiac-sign-8th-12th-house"">fears that still whisper</a> when you’re alone, the patterns you’ve outgrown but keep rehearsing. And while you usually prefer momentum over introspection, your ruling planet <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter is retrograde in Cancer</a> right now, pulling you into the emotional depths you’ve been skimming. This is less about solving everything, and more about sitting with what’s real. Let yourself grieve a version of you that’s ready to be laid to rest, because Sag season begins this weekend, and you deserve to greet it from a lighter perspective. </p>



<p>The Scorpio New Moon on November 20 invites you to set soul-deep intentions around trust, closure, and surrender. With Jupiter retrograde harmonizing with this moon in your intuitive sector, your dreams may feel unusually prophetic — pay attention. From now through November 30, ask yourself what quiet, restorative rituals you can commit to, not to get ahead, but to <em>come home</em> to yourself. This lunation isn’t about forcing breakthroughs — it’s about creating space for them. Think journaling, prayer, unposting, or even just letting yourself nap without guilt. The rebirth this moon brings may be invisible at first, but it’s happening beneath the surface. Trust that. The next chapter begins with a whisper, not a bang… and if you listen closely, you’ll hear your future calling your name. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, Scorpio season’s final act could feel like the deep exhale you didn’t know you were holding. With the Sun, Mercury (starting the 18th), and Venus all swirling through your sector of social influence, tech, and legacy, you’re being asked to rethink how you show up in collective spaces, not just as a figure of power, but as a vulnerable human being with dreams, quirks, and stories that need to be told. <br /><br />Mercury’s retrograde in Scorpio may unearth old <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/one-on-one-friendship-benefits"">group dynamics</a>, unprocessed feelings about friendships, or questions about the future you thought you were building. Don’t run from these insights. If certain people or platforms no longer feel aligned, you’re allowed to walk away. Venus softens the burn, helping you reconnect with kindred spirits who actually <em>get you</em>, especially as you re-evaluate your digital presence. The algorithm may be mysterious, but your intuition is clearer than ever — trust it. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Scorpio New Moon on the 20th offers a chance to rebirth your relationship with community, visibility, and your greater mission. What if the people you’re meant to lead or serve can only find you when you finally let go of playing small or being too “perfect”? Set intentions this week around the impact you want to leave behind, not just the results you want to achieve. With your ruler Saturn still retrograde in Pisces for another two weeks, activating your communication sector, this is also a prime time to assess the way you speak to yourself and others. The universe is preparing to hand you a mic in December, but right now, it’s checking your soul script. Edit it with care. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, it’s giving phoenix season, and this time, you’re the one shedding layers of “<em>shoulds</em>” and “<em>not yet</em>” to embrace what your soul has <em>actually</em> been craving. With the Sun, Mercury (as of the 18th), and Venus all lighting up your career, visibility, and reputation sector, you’re entering a renewal portal that’s far less about performance and far more about <em>power</em>. Mercury retrograde in Scorpio might stir up past professional doubts, old bosses, former ambitions, or a version of you who once thought “success” looked a certain way. Let it all resurface without shame. This isn’t about rehashing old storylines… it’s about reclaiming the pen and writing your next era from a deeper, wiser place. </p>



<p>By the time the Scorpio New Moon lands on the 20th, you may feel a rush of divine clarity: <em>it’s time to stop playing it safe</em>. Let this lunation help you visualize what a bold, soul-aligned legacy could feel like — not just professionally, but energetically. What do you want to be known for? Whose lives do you want to change? With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uranus-retrograde-gemini-taurus-september-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Uranus (your modern ruler) still retrograde in Taurus</a>, activating your roots and home sector, you’re being reminded that real success starts with safety, grounding, and emotional truth. The applause may come later, but the alignment starts now. Say yes to your deeper mission. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>There’s something ancient waking up inside of you, Pisces… and no, it’s not just Mercury retrograde nostalgia. With Scorpio season’s final week activating your adventure, travel, publishing, and philosophy sector, and Mercury swimming backward into that same realm on the 18th, you’re being asked to revisit long-lost dreams, studies, or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/02/141240/spiritual-but-not-religious-meaning"">spiritual beliefs</a> that shaped the person you are today. Venus is there too, helping you fall back in love with the parts of your worldview you once doubted. Whether it’s a literal journey or an emotional pilgrimage, this week whispers: <em>What if your next breakthrough comes from remembering, not rushing? </em></p>



<p>The Scorpio New Moon on the 20th is your official cue to set intentions around expansion, publishing, higher learning, and sacred study. Whether you want to write your first book, travel to your ancestral lands, or simply explore a new spiritual truth, this lunation is a reminder that you don’t need to know how — it’s enough to <em>believe</em> you can. With your traditional ruler <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter retrograde in Cancer</a>, still reviewing your creativity and joy sector, you’re learning how to feel your way into abundance instead of forcing it. Stay soft, but intentional. Stay mystical, but grounded. This week is proof that your dreams are still very much alive, and they’re waiting for you to say yes. </p>

<p>The world is both a literal and metaphorical hellscape right now, and no one knows that better than <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/12/10221298/natalie-portman-sexualized-as-child-in-movies"">Natalie Portman</a>. The actress, vegan, and longtime <a href=""https://www.green4ema.org/press/natalie-portman-reveals-what-she-does-to-combat-climate-change-including-not-buying-new-clothes"">climate</a> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/02/9384364/natalie-portman-oscars-dress-cape-female-directors-names-dior"">activist</a> has been at the forefront of calls for climate change and awareness throughout her decades-long career. And now, she’s using animation to further the cause. In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNUkW6ywV-c""><em>Arco</em></a>, a newly-released animated film from French director and illustrator <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ugobienvenu/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ugo Bienvenu </a>and produced by Portman, audiences are introduced to the not-so-distant future. Except in this version of Earth, in the year 2075, those tsunamis and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wildfire-eaton-california-lost-homes"">wild fires</a> that are becoming increasingly frequent and more devastating? They’re essentially the norm; with homes outfitted with glass domes that offer protection during bouts of extreme weather. It’s here that we meet Iris, an adventurous 10-year-old looking for adventure out of her day-to-day. When, one day, she rescues Arco, a time-travelling kid transported from the future, it becomes a story on the power and impact of friendship, in more ways than one. </p>



<p>Because with him, Arco brings realities of the future. Due to the impact of climate change, Arco and his family — along with their neighbours — no longer live on Earth, moving up to tree branch-like homes in the sky that allow for the planet to repair and regenerate without human interruption. It’s a surprising, albeit not so hard to imagine reality; and one made even more impactful through Bienvenu’s use of animation, which is able to engage viewers while presenting an impactful message. </p>



<p>“Animation to me is one of the best mediums for storytelling,” Bienvenu, whose other works includes short films <em>Dolly Zero </em>and 2019’s <em>L’entretien</em>, tells Refinery29. This is for a very particular reason, specifically, the way animated films resonate with viewers, often re-watching from when they’re kids all the way up to when they become adults, and choose to share their favourite movies, be it <em>Aladdin</em>, <em>The Fox and the Hound</em> or <em>Coco</em>, with their own children. “[You watch] animation movies all over your life, they accompany you all your life. And making a movie is long, so I wanted to do something that could have a [long] impact on the people that would watch it.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11943042.jpeg?width=1024&amp;height=577&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A577"" /></figure>



<p>And in many instances, it’s kids who are going to change the world — often in inventive ways. This is a truth made clear as Iris tries to help Arco get home, all while navigating changing environmental elements (Arco needs very specific weather — sunny with rain — to time travel) and a society that’s essentially run by drones. On the surface, it may seem like an engaging and earnest story about the bonds of friendship – and it is — but there’s something deeper to it, too. </p>



<p>As Iris and Arco try tirelessly to set up the perfect environmental conditions for him to return home, covering Iris’s front lawn in pillows and couch cushions for Arco to jump into and setting the sprinkler to go off at the exact right moment, there’s an underlying frustration with their inability to do so, and with the knowledge that those conditions, now in this current climate, are unlikely to come naturally. Arco’s stranded; a feeling probably akin to what many young people feel today when it comes to thinking about our planet. </p>



<p>But Arco and Iris don’t give up. Instead, continuing to press forward, determined that there’s a way to help Arco get home. </p>



<p>It was this optimistic way of looking at challenges, so inherent in Bienvenu’s story, and children in general, that drew Portman to the project in the first place. The actress recalls seeing early animatics of <em>Arco</em> and talking to director Bienvenu about his vision for the film — one in which creativity and imagination can be put towards a better future for our climate. “With environmental concerns, it was [usually] an attitude of ‘it’s difficult,’ but look at what imagination can bring,’” Portman says of this perspective. “There was hope and active participation in making the future through creativity. And I thought that was a very beautiful, activating way to look at a situation that we’re often kind of fatalistic about.” </p>

<p>And rightfully so. With climate change expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year globally between 2030 and 2050, according to <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health"">data from The World Health Organization</a>(WHO), it can be easy to count ourselves – and our planet — out; resign ourselves to give up trying to change our behaviour in the present, knowing that we’re already so far gone. But, Arco — and the team behind the movie — wants us to forget about the future, or more specifically, think that they know how the future will play out. Which is why, when Iris tries to follow Arco home, he encourages her to stay in the present, stating: “No one should know the future — ever.” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>With environmental concerns, it’s usually an attitude of ‘it’s difficult,’ but look at what imagination can bring… [In Arco] there’s hope and active participation in making the future through creativity.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It seems like a surprising sentiment, given the fact most young people have grown up being told that, when it comes to the environment and climate change, the future is the only thing we should be thinking about — and how our actions now will impact our children, grandchildren and great grandchildren long after we’re gone.     </p>



<p><strong>“</strong>If you know the future, it gives you no agency in the present. You think, ‘Oh, that’s how it’s gonna be, so [there’s] nothing I can do about it,’” Portman says. “If you accept that you don’t know what the future’s going to be like, then you have a part in changing it and affecting it.”</p>



<p>Which is what we, as viewers, eventually see. While we don’t see what happens to Arco after he travels home, audiences do get a glimpse into what Iris takes from her time with her new friend; primarily, inspiration to go forth and make a difference for her own future. Through small glimpses at photos and sketches in Iris’ room, audiences see that the curious, intelligent, vivacious 10-year-old we’re first introduced to will go on to  use that curiosity and vivaciousness to try and create a better future for the planet, going on to calculate, sketch and create the more sustainable world Arco will one day inhabit. </p>



<p>It’s a lesson on the impact one person can have for both kids and viewers who are coming to the film as adults already. While <em>Arco’</em>s main audience demographic may initially seem to be those under 12-years-old, “we want to speak to the kids that are still in ourselves,” Bienvenu adds,” because we still are kids in a way; a big part of me is still a kid and I want to feed that part of myself.”</p>
