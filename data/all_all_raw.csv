They wanted a space outside the house to temporarily store and wash vegetables harvested from their fields. They wanted a place where their young children could play freely and enjoy life. From these key ideas, the house-building journey began with creating a large earthen-floored space that connects the inside and outside, becoming the heart of the family's life.</p>",

<p>Architectural space has long been framed by permanence: rooms for fixed functions, facades that clearly define where exterior ends and interior begins. Yet contemporary life is defined by overlap and transition: between work and living, interior and exterior, privacy and community. Spatial needs evolve continually, demanding architecture that can respond, adapt, and remain relevant over time. </p>",

<p>Manor Mirage is located in the wilderness of Huai'an County, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/zhangjiakou"">Zhangjiakou</a> City, Hebei Province, adjacent to the Zhangbei Grassland. Its design core lies in the lightweight translation and functional regeneration of the abandoned concrete bridge on the site. With ""mirage"" as a metaphor, the project, on the basis of respecting the site memory and grassland culture, constructs a spatial form with both a sense of disappearance and transience through low-intervention strategies, realizing the dialectical coexistence of architecture and nature, tradition and modernity.</p>",

<p>K's Veranda, the latest chapter in the story of K's Charcoal in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/ahmedabad"">Ahmedabad</a>, embodies the spirit of Hiren Patel Architects + Design (HPAD) — crafting spaces that <em>breathe, balance, and belong.</em> What once was a lively, open lawn beside the restaurant has blossomed into a soulful retreat. Here, walls seem to melt into the landscape, and the indoors drift effortlessly into the open air. It doesn't read as an addition, but as a graceful evolution, carrying the familiar warmth and comfort of its predecessor, yet whispering in its own quiet voice.</p>",

<p>La Doyenne is a renovation and the expansion project of a Victorian house built in 1887, a few steps away from Square Saint-Louis in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/montreal"">Montreal</a>. In a high-density built environment characteristic of the Plateau Mont Royal, the main challenge to meet the desire of its new occupants was to design an extension in the back yard preserving their privacy from the side and rear buildings. The project's singularity comes from the integration of multiple floor level variations. One enters the house through the living room, located half a level above the street, to reach the backyard, slightly recessed into the garden. This intervention aims to create a height offset in relation to the level of the neighboring terraces while reinforcing the verticality of the interior volumes.</p>",

A thoughtful designer in an era of loud personalities… it’s a tidy version of him, and it’s true, but it leaves out important details that earn him a place in this series.</p><p>Madison spent his early career watching a country lose its footing. Under the Articles of Confederation, states behaved like independent rivals. New York taxed goods coming in from New Jersey. Virginia and Maryland fought over navigation rights. Each state was convinced it saw the situation correctly and expected the rest of the country to comply. Of course, it didn’t work that way, and what emerged instead was a tangled mess of competing systems that produced exactly the kind of chaos Madison feared.</p><figure><img alt=""Engraved illustration of Shays’ Rebellion showing armed state militia firing a volley in winter snow, with smoke rising from their muskets. Several rebels lie on the ground while others retreat or fall back, and additional militia stand in formation near buildings and leafless trees in the background."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/691/1*qrQ_rJl66qKb1vFVpye-iA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Shays Rebellion — America in class</figcaption></figure><p>Then came Shays’ Rebellion. A small group of farmers in Massachusetts pushed the state close to collapse over debt policy. Madison noticed how little it took to shake the whole system, and that moment told him more about the country’s stability than any debate ever had.</p><p>He saw the same instability inside Virginia. Religious groups (Anglicans, Baptists, Presbyterians) each fought to define public life according to their own doctrine. Each new majority produced a new attempt to legislate ‘certainty’ (a topic we’ll tackle another day). It convinced Madison that no group, no matter how principled, can be trusted with the whole system.</p><p>These observations led to a very important insight:</p><p><strong>People don’t balance themselves. Their interests need to be balanced for them.</strong></p><p>His education was important in helping him articulate this.</p><ul><li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montesquieu""><strong>Montesquieu</strong></a> warned about <strong>concentrated power</strong>.</li><li><a href=""https://lawliberty.org/why-we-need-humes-wisdom-on-factions/""><strong>Hume</strong></a> explained why <strong>factions form and why they don’t disappear</strong>.</li><li>The <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/event/Scottish-Enlightenment""><strong>Scottish Enlightenment</strong> </a>taught him that <strong>complexity survives by</strong> <strong>distributing conflict rather than suppressing it</strong>.</li></ul><p>So Madison built a republic that relied on a balanced system.</p><ul><li>A large republic makes it harder for any one group to dominate.</li><li>Layered governments force negotiation instead of obedience.</li><li>Separate branches introduce friction (deliberate, sometimes frustrating friction) to keep hardline views from turning into authority.</li><li>Even procedural delays weren’t accidents; they acted as insulation.</li></ul><p>Building and planning for durability, however, meant he could build for unity.</p><p>And this is the part of Madison worth remembering: <strong>he understood that certainty is a destabilizer.</strong> Once a group believes it sees the whole picture, it stops feeling like it needs to listen. Once listening stops, balance goes with it. And after balance, legitimacy is a fast follow.</p><p>The system he designed survives because this heavy load is ‘distributed’. We only really notice his work when someone tries to remove that balance.</p><p>*Cough cough*</p><figure><img alt=""Smiling Elinor Ostrom with gray hair and glasses, wearing a brightly patterned red and multicolor top, standing against a solid orange background."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1cuc5roaBnJwiz2pf1bEew.png"" /><figcaption>Elinor Ostrom</figcaption></figure><h3>Elinor Ostrom: The proof that balance can be built</h3><p>Elinor Ostrom usually appears in the public imagination as the first woman to win the <a href=""https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2009/ostrom/facts/"">Nobel Prize in Economics</a>. She spent her career far from academic models and closer to the places where cooperation was something people needed in order to eat, drink, farm and survive.</p><p>Her research took her into forests in Nepal, irrigation systems in Spain, fishing communities in Turkey and water boards in Los Angeles. Each place had the same problem in a different scenery: a shared resource, a mix of competing interests and the constant possibility that one group might push its agenda far enough to throw everything off balance.</p><p><a href=""https://sesmad.dartmouth.edu/theories/54#:~:text=In%201990%20Elinor%20Ostrom%20published,Self%2DMonitoring%3B%20Self%20Sanctions%3B"">Ostrom watched closely at how these communities behaved.</a> She noticed that the systems that worked well weren’t run by a single leader or by a perfectly unified community. Instead, they relied on rules that spread responsibility across the people who depended on the resource(s). Boundaries were clear. Rules were shaped by the people who had to live with them. Monitoring was handled locally (because outsiders didn’t understand). Disputes were settled quickly and without big ceremony. And when conditions changed, the rules changed with them.</p><p>These were places built by people who understood imbalance because they felt it the moment it appeared. That’s the heart of Ostrom’s contribution: <strong>Balance works when it’s shaped by the people closest to the problem.</strong></p><p>She saw that when decision-makers were at a distance from the decisions they were making, they had a confidence they hadn’t earned. The closer they were to the problem, the more careful they were with the solution.</p><p>Ostrom also paid attention to the early signs that signaled a system was in trouble. For instance, if a single group found ways to steer the rules in its favor, and the system lost its ability to balance out. The worst failures happened when outsiders stepped in with a single fix and applied it everywhere. Solutions that looked great from a distance often unraveled the arrangements that had kept the community stable in the first place.</p><p>This is important and confirmed something Madison understood intuitively: balance doesn’t maintain itself. It has to be built. And it’s built best through local negotiation, small adjustments, and shared constraints that prevent any one perspective from becoming the entire truth.</p><p>For her, balance was more resilience than a moral posture. And the places she studied didn’t have the luxury of ignoring that. They depended on it.</p><figure><img alt=""Mahmood Mamdani with gray hair, glasses, and a short beard sits on an outdoor bench, smiling gently.

He saw that societies fall apart because people get sorted into identities so rigid that disagreement stops being part of politics and starts becoming the whole point of it.</p><p>His work in East Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East all circled the same problem: W<strong>hen politics harden around identity categories, balance becomes impossible. The categories do the thinking for you.</strong></p><p>What he found was more unsettling than ideological and was baked into the structure itself.</p><p>He showed how colonial administrations divided people into “natives” and “settlers,” assigning rights and responsibilities based on identity rather than citizenship. Once those categories were in place, everything that followed (representation, punishment, land access, even the definition of violence) was shaped by the category, not the behavior.</p><p><strong>The pattern was brutally consistent:</strong></p><ul><li>People stopped seeing each other as individuals and started treating each other as types.</li><li>Arguments became personal because they were tied to who someone <em>was</em>, not what they said or did.</li><li>And instead of working within the same rules, every group insisted its own view set the rules.</li></ul><p>Once a political system runs on identity rather than structure, the entire framework begins to tilt to one side. Laws formalize conflict rather than stabilize it and public life stops being about negotiation and becomes a contest to control the category that sits closest to power.</p><p>This is the core of Mamdani’s warning: <strong>once a group can define categories, it no longer needs to define the argument.</strong> The system starts carrying their weight for them.</p><p>Here are some of his examples:</p><ul><li>In Rwanda, colonial administrators turned fluid social identities into fixed racial categories, replacing political negotiation with inherited status. This was a shift that left the society permanently off-balance.</li><li>In Sudan, laws distinguished “tribes” in ways that reshaped land rights and obligations, guaranteeing that every political conflict would be read as ethnic rather than structural.</li><li>In Uganda, colonial policy created systems where citizenship and identity pulled in opposite directions, ensuring that no debate stayed a debate for long.</li></ul><p>Different places, same mechanics: C<strong>ertainty, hardened into identity becomes a destabilizer.</strong></p><p>And this is where Mamdani plugs directly into the argument I’m making.</p><ul><li>Madison feared the dominance of one single group.</li><li>Ostrom showed how to prevent it through shared rules and distributed responsibility.</li><li>Mamdani shows what happens when none of that holds true. When people collapse a complex political world into a few fixed categories and then defend those categories as if their survival depends on it.</li></ul><p>He explains the modern reflex where expanding someone’s frame feels like an attack. Nuance becomes betrayal, and balance? Well, that looks an awful lot like disloyalty.</p><p>I’m not saying people are unreasonable. I’m saying <strong>their political identity is doing too much work. </strong>Once that identity carries the whole argument, the whole thing starts to slide.</p><h3>Where All Three Collide</h3><p>You don’t need to be a political theorist to feel when a system is off-balance. People sense it in small ways before they can articulate it. A policy feels rushed. A rule changes too quickly. Decisions start to look engineered for someone else’s benefit.</p><p>What Madison understood, Ostrom proved, and Mamdani diagnosed is that imbalance isn’t dramatic… at first. It appears in places where one idea or one identity starts carrying more weight than it should. And once that happens, people react the same way they do when you widen their argument: they retreat into the part they understand and defend it like it’s the whole story.</p><p>You see this in every procedural fight we pretend is about ideology. Gerrymandering is a fight about boundaries. The filibuster is a fight about friction. Court expansions, emergency powers, rule changes, executive orders … each one chips away at the balances that were designed to slow certainty down.</p><p>What we don’t see is people panicking because of any specific outcome. The reason? Things change. Just wait a bit and balance should bring things back in order if it was a bad decision.</p><p>Don’t you think it’s interesting that panic actually comes from people reacting to systems when it’s those systems that feel like they’re being manipulated or unbalanced?</p><p>Madison would recognize the pattern immediately.<br />Ostrom would see the loss of shared constraint.<br />Mamdani would see identity doing more work than structure.</p><p>When a system becomes too easy to take advantage of, the people inside it start holding their positions tighter. Balance stops feeling like a responsibility and starts feeling like a betrayal. There’s an irony there that’s hard to miss.</p><p>The thing a plural society needs most is the first thing people abandon when they feel the least bit of instability.</p><p>And once identity becomes the primary way people organize themselves, even small adjustments feel like attacks. You’re not disagreeing with their idea; you’re threatening the category that idea is supposed to protect. The politics stops being about governance and becomes about defending a sense of self.</p><h3>Reflection</h3><p>This essay took me a while, but the longer I read about these three, the clearer the pattern becomes.</p><p>People cling to their ideas because the alternatives feel unsafe. Balance threatens certainty, and certainty is where people place their moral grounding.</p><p>But every system that survives (every republic, every community, every shared resource) survives for the same reason: it never lets one idea, one identity, or one group do all the work.</p><p>Madison designed for that.<br />Ostrom documented it.<br />Mamdani warns what happens when we lose it.</p><p>If the world feels louder or angrier than it used to, I don’t think it’s because we’re more divided. I think it’s because our desire for balance is getting weaker and it’s become a risk instead of a responsibility.</p><p>It doesn’t have to stay that way.</p><p>It just requires something we aren’t great at right now: looking at the bigger picture.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=b14effc622b4"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/when-one-idea-does-all-the-work-b14effc622b4"">When one idea does all the work</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Doing the right thing should be easy.</h4><figure><img alt=""Da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*APj-7duB_TuT3mOR.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man</figcaption></figure><p>Human engineering isn’t what you might think. It’s not a eugenic nightmare of bioengineering and gene selection. Thank goodness, it’s much more benign. Instead, human engineering is a multi-disciplinary field that brings together psychologists, engineers, cognitive scientists, organizational behavioral specialists, and designers. Their goal is to make it easy for people to do the right thing. [Redacted: High brow <em>“A Clockwork Orange” </em>joke] Sometimes referred to as interaction design or cognitive ergonomics, the aim of <a href=""https://www.dau.edu/glossary/human-engineering"">human engineering</a> is to improve human performance by looking at <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915002860"">systems</a>.</p><p>Simply put, human engineering tries to make it easier to do the right thing and harder to do the wrong thing for any task or activity. This aim is achieved through the design (and alteration of existing designs) of the technology, systems, and environments that individuals interact with. Immediately we see the application of human engineering into the paradigm of system dynamics and <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/the-architecture-of-human-error-ae69c732eb79"">human error</a>.</p><p>There are many principles of human engineering, but one of the most important is the importance of designing the interactions of humans and objects to <a href=""https://medium.com/@adnanmasood/human-compatible-engineering-value-alignment-in-artificial-intelligence-3ebb39222104"">align function with action</a>. To demonstrate, consider the very common scenario of turning on a burner on the kitchen stove.</p><h4>The Mysterious Case of the Wrong Burner</h4><p>Has it ever happened that you’ve gone to turn on the stove and lit the wrong burner? It’s not just you. It’s a very common problem and one of the most studied topics in the field of human engineering. Stoves are not advanced technology and lighting the stove only requires one turn of the knob. So how come we’re so prone to these simple mistakes?</p><p>The answer has to do with the way the alignment of form and function. Stovetops are tremendously bad at this alignment. Consider two popular configurations of commercial stoves:</p><figure><img alt=""Two stovetop configurations. One with knobs grouped, the other with them evenly spaced and linear."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/466/0*W7NsBm1XLq4jfD-G.png"" /><figcaption>Source: Design of Everyday Things</figcaption></figure><p>In typical stove designs (let’s call them Configuration A and Configuration B), we see that the burners are aligned as a 2x2 rectangle, whereas the knobs are aligned linearly along the front. The knobs and the burners are configured differently. To use a technical term, we could say that these configurations have poor <a href=""https://uxplanet.org/designing-for-spatial-ux-in-ar-vr-a-beginner-to-advanced-guide-to-immersive-interface-design-c55f092deb0b?gi=debcdfcae8a8"">spatial compatibility</a>.</p><p>Configuration B is slightly better than Configuration A, because there is a natural grouping between the two burners and knobs on the left and the two burners and knobs on the right. Nevertheless, in this configuration errors will be common and proper use will rely on reading the labels on the knobs or trial and error. In short, it takes some level of cognitive effort, beyond intuition to ensure consistent proper use of the stove.</p><h4>The Better Way</h4><p>Now consider two slightly different configurations. In Configuration C the burners are still arranged in a 2x2 rectangle, but now, the knobs are also arranged in a similar way. There is a natural alignment between the controls and the device. No labels are needed.</p><figure><img alt=""Two (different) stovetop configurations. One forming a dimaond the other an arch shape"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/457/0*RxPGxuDmbpJLxyB2.png"" /><figcaption>Source: Design of Everyday Things</figcaption></figure><p>Configuration D provides another natural and intuitive layout, but this time maintains the linear arrangement of the knobs. Simply by bringing the two back burners closer together to align with the knobs, the stovetop has gone from an inscrutable, error-prone appliance to something that is intuitive and easy to use.</p><p>Without objection, we can see why the stovetop configurations in Configuration C and Configuration D are better. Not only will these configurations produce fewer errors and lead to more consistent and effective operation of the stove but they also rely on intuition and require less cognitive processing to achieve the greater result! A win-win!</p><p>Oh by the way, how much did the change cost? We used the same space, the same controls, and the same materials. We can decrease errors, build resiliency, and decrease the cognitive load without sizable investments! Win-Win-Win!</p><h4>The Principle of Spatial Compatibility</h4><p>What we’ve just witnessed is the principle of <strong>spatial compatibility </strong>in action. This principle states that controls should be arranged to correspond naturally with the devices they control. When there’s a clear, intuitive mapping between control and function, people simply know what to do. No thinking required. No labels needed. No errors made.</p><p>This might seem obvious when pointed out, but look around your environment. How many poorly designed interfaces do you interact with daily? How many times do you have to stop and think about which button does what? How often do you make “simple mistakes” that are actually design failures?</p><p>The stove example illustrates a profound truth:<strong> </strong><a href=""https://www.visualexpert.com/Resources/humanvsdesignerror.html""><strong>most of what we attribute to human error is actually design error</strong></a><strong>. </strong>We blame ourselves for our mistakes when we should be blaming the systems we’re forced to work within.</p><h4>When Design Betrays You</h4><p>Stovetops are not the only place where we encounter human engineering in our daily lives. Even something as simple as a door can pose significant challenges to human-technology interaction (Yes, a door is technology). We’ve all been in that embarrassing situation where we push a door that should’ve been pulled and vice versa. But have you ever stopped to ask why you made an error? Take solace in knowing that it was the door’s fault and not your own.</p><p>These doors did you wrong. They betrayed you. They gave a signal that was incorrect, and your only fault was that you trusted them. Who knew that doors could be so deceitful? Take heart, this is a very common problem. One person who this has happened to a lot is <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/don-norman?srsltid=AfmBOop_maSfXFhLO5D93jNZZmHJpS8CVHLz0C-TGvc5aMKE9f66dhEk"">Don Norman</a>. Don knows a lot about these sorts of doors. Don has studied these doors so much that these species of doors are actually called “Norman Doors.”</p><p>In his book “<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654"">The Design of Everyday Things</a>” he explains:</p><blockquote><em>“How can such a simple thing as a door be so confusing? A door would seem to be about as simple a device as possible. There is not much you can do to a door: you can open it or shut it…The design of the door should indicate how to work it without the needs of signs or trial and error.”</em></blockquote><h4>The Principle of Discoverability</h4><p>The chief way these doors betray the user is by abandoning another fundamental and important design principle, the principle of <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/discoverability?srsltid=AfmBOoqcveYvH3s_TDQKAhmw5xqskniMY4RXp_QEpwXDtVGn9s-Pr4yW"">discoverability</a>. The principle of discoverability simply states that any designed object should make it clear to the user how to correctly use that object. In the case of the Norman door, not only did the door make it unclear, but it probably sent the exact opposite signal than what was required.</p><p>Consider a door with a horizontal push bar on it. That bar screams “PUSH ME!” to anyone who sees it. It’s a clear affordance — a visual cue about how the object should be used. Now imagine that same door with a “PULL” sign on it. The sign contradicts everything the door is telling you with its design. The horizontal bar is still there, still suggesting you should push, but now you’re supposed to ignore that signal and pull instead.</p><figure><img alt=""An example of a Norman door. A horizontal bar with a “Pull” label"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*sw9GFNd08qM_ojY8.png"" /><figcaption>A Norman Door. Source: 99percentinvisible.org</figcaption></figure><p>This is fundamentally bad design. A well-designed pull door should have a vertical handle that you can grip. A well-designed push door should have a flat plate or push bar. The design itself should communicate the proper use without requiring any labels or explanations.</p><h4>Why This Matters More Than You Think</h4><p>The Norman door is an important example of human engineering in daily life because it showcases how the alignment of human action and the environment impacts our propensity to make mistakes. If something as simple, ordinary, and untechnical as a door can impact the decisions, efficiency, and productivity of individuals than how much more will this be true for complex systems.</p><p>Indeed, the inefficiencies of these everyday objects may seem trivial and insignificant but the underlying principles they demonstrate are anything but, especially when applied to industry. What these vignettes demonstrate is important and powerful. Using the same space and the same equipment for the stove, we nearly <a href=""https://asq.org/quality-resources/mistake-proofing?srsltid=AfmBOoovPTOqO74WKlYiOk5XOyz1QlaFdxyiu7kEPCBfftUkOWoouHvx"">eliminated the possibility for error</a>. No rework, no guess and check, no errors, no need for labels, less thinking, no need to stop and think about the result of our actions and all for no money.</p><p>Human engineering is potent and powerful.</p><h4>The Core Principles of Human Engineering</h4><p>While there are many principles of human engineering, several stand out as particularly important for designing better systems:</p><p><strong>1. Spatial Compatibility:</strong> Controls should be arranged to naturally correspond with the things they control. The layout should be intuitive and obvious.</p><p><strong>2. Discoverability:</strong> The design should clearly communicate how something is meant to be used. Users shouldn’t have to guess or rely on labels and instructions.</p><p><strong>3. Feedback:</strong> The system should provide clear, immediate feedback about what’s happening. When you press a button, something should happen that confirms your action was received.</p><p><strong>4. Constraints:</strong> Good design constrains behavior in ways that prevent errors. If something can only be done one way, and that way is the correct way, errors become impossible.</p><p><strong>5. Mapping:</strong> There should be a clear relationship between controls and their effects. Natural mappings leverage existing knowledge and expectations. (I even created <a href=""http://sixsigma-consulting.com/tetris"">a fun Tetris game</a> you can to play to demonstrate this principle)</p><p><strong>6. Affordances:</strong> The design should suggest its own use. A handle affords pulling. A button affords pressing. A flat surface affords pushing.</p><h4>The Human-Centered Design Philosophy</h4><p>At its core, human engineering embodies a fundamental philosophy: when a person makes an error while using a system, it’s the system that failed, not the person. This perspective shift is revolutionary. Instead of training people harder, writing more procedures, or adding more warnings, we redesign the system so that errors become difficult or impossible to make.</p><p>This doesn’t mean humans are absolved of all responsibility. It means we recognize the reality of human limitations and capabilities, and we design accordingly. We accept that people will be distracted, tired, stressed, and forgetful. We acknowledge that people will sometimes be in a hurry, sometimes be interrupted, sometimes misremember.</p><p>Rather than fighting against human nature, human engineering works with it. Rather than demanding superhuman perfection, it creates systems where ordinary human performance is sufficient for excellent results.</p><h4>The Cognitive Load Consideration</h4><p>One of the most important benefits of good human engineering is the reduction of cognitive load. Every poorly designed interface, every ambiguous control, every unclear instruction adds to the mental burden people must carry. When you have to stop and think about which burner is which, or whether to push or pull a door, you’re <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/cognitive-load/"">using cognitive resources that could be applied elsewhere</a>.</p><p>Good design frees up mental capacity. It allows you to focus on what matters rather than wrestling with interfaces. It reduces <a href=""https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/decision-fatigue"">decision fatigue</a>. It makes the right choice the obvious choice, the easy choice, the path of least resistance.</p><p>Think about how exhausting it is to navigate a poorly designed website, a confusing form, or a cluttered workspace. Now think about how effortless it is to use a well-designed tool. That difference, that feeling of friction versus flow, is human engineering in action.</p><h4>Application Beyond Physical Objects</h4><p>While we’ve focused on physical examples like stoves and doors, human engineering principles apply to every system you interact with:</p><ul><li><strong>Digital interfaces:</strong> Are your most-used apps and tools intuitive, or do they require constant mental translation?</li><li><strong>Work processes:</strong> Do your workflows naturally guide you toward the right actions, or do they create opportunities for confusion?</li><li><strong>Personal routines:</strong> Are your habits supported by environmental design, or do they require constant willpower to maintain?</li><li><strong>Communication systems:</strong> Do your methods of staying informed and responsive flow naturally, or do they create constant friction?</li></ul><figure><img alt=""A man’s hand inserting a card into an ATM"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*mvMu1gqWP7PHccug.jpg"" /><figcaption>A pime example of good work processes, ATMs require you to take your card before your cash, making it unlikely you error (forget your card) Source: bankrate.com/</figcaption></figure><p>In each of these domains, the principles remain the same. Make the right thing easy. Make the wrong thing hard. Provide clear feedback. Create natural mappings. Reduce cognitive load.</p><h4>The Power of Environmental Design</h4><p>Human engineering reminds us that we don’t need to become better people to perform better. We need to create better systems. We don’t need more discipline, more willpower, more training. We need environments that support us rather than fight us.</p><p>This is liberating. It means improvement doesn’t require becoming someone you’re not. It requires thoughtfully designing the systems and environments you operate within. It means recognizing that when you consistently make the same “mistake,” it’s probably not your fault — it’s a design failure waiting to be fixed.</p><p>The question isn’t “How can I be more careful?” The question is “How can I redesign this system so being careful isn’t necessary?”</p><p>That’s the promise and power of human engineering.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=65e59d9ac6d8"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/human-engineering-65e59d9ac6d8"">Human engineering</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4><strong>Three stories of tools that refused to sell out</strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Middle finger coming out of a phone at a big bag of money"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dPHcRZF2WJZWuHz_Yc-ERw.png"" /><figcaption>Middle finger coming out of a phone at a big bag of money</figcaption></figure><p>Lately I’ve been writing critically about the current state of tech. So much of it feels infested with ads, deceptive design patterns or erosions of privacy all engineered to squeeze every last drop of engagement out of our already overstimulated grey matter. So as a contrast, I thought it’d be worth remembering that not all technology follows this trajectory.</p><p>At this point, many of us have grown so accustomed to terrible treatment from our tech providers that we mistake it for the natural order of things. I wrote an article last week about <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-evolution-of-youtube-how-every-platform-evolves-into-an-ad-machine-9e6032ff2d20"">YouTube’s slow shift from serving users to serving advertisers</a>, and someone commented: “Sadly, as long as the internet is largely ‘free,’ then there will always be ads. Always 🫠🫠🫠.” And while I get the feeling. Sometimes it really feels like we’re like travellers stuck in an airport terminal, forced to accept whatever fate awaits us, because there’s nowhere else to go. But there are more examples than you’d think of technology that has stayed open, portable, and most importantly put people over profit!</p><p>I’ll be sharing the stories of three of my favourites: Blender, OBS, and Penpot. One uniting thread across all these apps is these tools were built out of necessity, born from frustration, and carried forward by creators who wanted something better for <strong>themselves</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>others</strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""Blender render with logo overtop"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RDRKc_1TAwV2H_tsT5buQQ.png"" /><figcaption>Blender render with logo overtop</figcaption></figure><p>Blender, for those who don’t know, is an open-source 3D modeling and animation tool currently sitting near the tipy top of its category. It’s used by world-class VFX studios all over the world and, as of 2020, had over <a href=""https://www.blender.org/news/blender-by-the-numbers-2020/"">14 million downloads</a>, a number that continues to grow year over year. It’s an incredibly successful project and believe it or not you don’t have to pay the low-price of $12.99 a month to get a subscription to it. There’s no hidden upsell, no temporary trial access, no marketing funnel to trap you in. It is free, fully open source, and wickedly powerful.</p><p><a href=""https://www.blender.org/about/history/"">Blender was originally created in the early ’90s</a> inside a Dutch animation studio called NeoGeo. It began as an internal tool, something practical that made life easier for the artists who worked there. After the studio went belly up, Blender’s creator, Ton Roosendaal, tried to keep the project alive through a startup called Not a Number (NaN). He roped in some investors, made a splash, and then the dot-com bubble popped and evaporated the funding and stopped Blender in its tracks.</p><p>The tool was effectively locked away: trapped in the hands of investors, sitting unnoticed in a folder full of failed acquisitions gathering dust in some corporate archive alongside other abandoned experiments. That very well could’ve been the end of the story, but its creator Ton had seen the impact the tool had on the community. He knew what it meant for artists to have access to something this capable without needing to pay. So he did something wild at the time, he launched a campaign to buy Blender back from corporate limbo. Remember, this is pre kickstarter, grassroots tech funding movements weren’t all the rage. He needed 100,000 euros to reclaim the rights and release it from corporate exile.</p><p>Armed with a mailing list and a landing page he mobilized the community. Artists, hobbyists, students, tinkerers all threw a coin in the hat and in just seven weeks, he raised the entire amount. A regular ol’ Bernie-Sanders-style grassroots fundraiser. Blender was released as fully open-source software under the GNU license, and the <a href=""https://www.blender.org/about/foundation/"">Blender Foundation</a> was born, a nonprofit stewarding a public tool.</p><p>Today, Blender is funded through a donation-driven development fund supported by companies<a href=""https://fund.blender.org/""> like Ubisoft, Meta, NVIDIA</a>, and thousands of individuals who believe in its mission. It remains one of the clearest examples we have of community-driven, people first software.</p><p>Another thing I found, across all these stories is that somewhere at the centre, there’s usually a quietly stubborn technical weirdo holding the line, resisting the gravitational pull of the cash-out. That’s certainly the case with OBS. For those who aren’t familiar, OBS is best-in-class when it comes to live-streaming. If you’ve ever watched a livestream, you’ve almost certainly seen OBS in action. And the “lowly technical saint” who built it goes by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBS_Studio"">Hugh “Jim” Bailey</a>. His aim wasn’t to create the most widely used tool for streamers, it was to try and build something better for himself so he could stream <em>StarCraft II</em>… That’s it. Just a programmer trying to share a game he loved.</p><figure><img alt=""OBS interface and logo"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*HcW7fzPPxfYS1sSP"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.downloadsource.net/how-to-reset-the-obs-interface-reset-the-obs-ui/n/23048/"">OBS interface and logo</a></figcaption></figure><p>But that’s what matters, oftentimes we forget that the DNA of the people who build these tools infuses into the technology. There’s a weird Frankenstein effect when it comes to technology. In my opinion, understanding who stitched the monster together often helps you understand how a tool ends up the way it does. I find that this is perfectly illustrated by Spotify. It presents itself as a music company, but its founders <a href=""https://soundiiz.com/blog/who-are-daniel-ek-and-martin-lorentzon-spotifys-founders/""><strong>Daniel Ek</strong>, who sold his ad-tech company <strong>Advertigo</strong> to TradeDoubler, and <strong>Martin Lorentzon</strong>, the co-founder of <strong>TradeDoubler</strong>,</a> one of Europe’s largest online advertising networks. They were not record crate-diggers or historians of music. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnXwkh2Vg54"">They were ad-tech entrepreneurs looking for a scalable payload for programmatic advertising</a>, and music simply happened to be the cheapest, most convenient content vehicle. <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/spotify-has-an-ai-problem-a4d6729c715b"">Spotify is what you get when you pour ad-tech DNA into a music platform.</a></p><p><a href=""https://gamingcareers.com/podcasts/creating-obs-interview-with-jim/"">When Jim Bailey released OBS, he spent the first three years answering every forum post, every bug report, every direct message</a>. He was in the trenches with the people using his tool. He saw the struggles of beginners. He saw the streamers who depended on OBS to earn an income or build a community. And because he was so close to the people using the software, he never once saw them as assets. He saw them as peers.</p><p>So when OBS exploded in popularity and Jim started receiving acquisition offers in the <strong>seven-figure range</strong>, he didn’t acquiesce. He thought about what it means to hand his <strong>peers</strong>, millions of them, to people who probably didn’t care about them the way he did. Jim is not a public figure, so finding quotes from him is rare, but in a podcast he did with <a href=""https://gamingcareers.com/podcasts/creating-obs-interview-with-jim/"">Pete Wilkins on the <em>Gaming Careers</em> show</a>, he put it plainly in two quotes that I love:</p><blockquote><a href=""https://gamingcareers.com/podcasts/creating-obs-interview-with-jim/"">“They don’t necessarily want your program — they want the users. And it’s hard to put a price on your users like that.”</a></blockquote><p>and the succinct, but dripping with his ethos:</p><blockquote><a href=""https://gamingcareers.com/podcasts/creating-obs-interview-with-jim/"">“I don’t need a yacht.”</a></blockquote><p>This was clearly not a financially “smart” move. Today, OBS is maintained by a tiny core team and a smattering of volunteer contributors. OBS remained open not because it was easy, but because its creator refused to sell the people who depended on it.</p><p>The last example I want to touch should be near and dear to the heart of every product designer. <a href=""https://penpot.app/"">Penpot</a>! Penpot was created by a company called Kaleidos, a decade-old studio that originally operated as a kind of elite technical/research partner for hire. Their full name <em>Kaleidos Open Source</em> reflected a very real internal philosophy: they only used open-source tools, they built for their clients using open-source tools, and they carved out protected time to create their own open software.</p><figure><img alt=""Penpot logo surrounded by UI graphics"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/690/0*UIB6QyIvTW2q5snR.jpeg"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://community.penpot.app/t/its-time-for-penpot-to-almost-move-away-from-the-dom/6437"">Penpot logo surrounded by UI graphics</a></figcaption></figure><p>For years, Kaleidos was a developer-centric team. They outsourced most of the design work, and that worked fine, until one day they had to hire their first internal designers. That’s when their philosophy came face to face with reality. While developers frolic in an open-source oasis, designers were stuck with a collection of janky, slow, unpolished tools that barely, and I mean <strong>barely</strong> met professional standards. The truth was the design team simply didn’t have open-source equivalents of the quality that developers took for granted. So while the designers loved the ethos, the tools just weren’t good enough and they needed Figma. So Kaleidos conceded. They broke their own rule. But they broke it with a single condition:</p><blockquote><a href=""https://possiblefutures.tech/posts/interview-with-penpot-ceo-pablo-ruiz-muzquiz-on-open-source-design-and-ethical-funding"">“We’ll use Figma… but while we use it, we’ll build the Figma killer.” Pablo Ruiz-Múzquiz</a>, founder of Penpot &amp; Kaleidos</blockquote><p>And that is how <a href=""https://possiblefutures.tech/posts/interview-with-penpot-ceo-pablo-ruiz-muzquiz-on-open-source-design-and-ethical-funding"">Penpot was born</a>! Early versions were rough, but Penpot has come a long way in just a few years. And since its release in February of 2021, Kaleidos fully committed to just working on their own tools and shut down their client-services business entirely!</p><p>They call themselves the Figma Killer because they’re an ambition team. Though maybe not the ambition we think of when we picture ambitious people. Not the Machiavellian business man dressed to the nines, stepping out of some expensive sports car working their way up a corporate ladder to give an inspiring talk at some conference full of suits. This is a different ambition, a moral ambition, which drives companies like Kaleidos to build products that put the power of tools into people’s hands. It’s hard to imagine being in a position of building a tool that you put blood sweat and tears into and not wanting the greatest remuneration possible, but the reason that all three of these founders are able to do it is because their ambition isn’t monetary, it’s about <strong>impact</strong>. They want people to feel like they have autonomy and are empowered.</p><p>When you step back from these stories: Blender, OBS, Penpot all show a pattern. They didn’t become popular because of market positioning or manipulative growth and monetization strategies. They became what they are because the people behind them had values that were strong enough to resist selling out their users.</p><p>Each of these tools carries the fingerprint of its creator’s worldview. Software is not neutral. It inherits the values of the people who make it. We treat platform decay as inevitable. But I think that inevitability story favours the people making the choice of profit over people.</p><p>And that’s why these three examples matter so much. They remind us that it is still possible, even now, even in this tech climate to build software rooted in generosity, openness, and respect. To build tools that don’t treat users like resources to mine and exist because someone cared more about enabling others rather than maximizing returns. We need more of that kind of ambition.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3985d97f3b23"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/when-software-has-integrity-3985d97f3b23"">When software has integrity</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Great ideas arrive on their own time. The design stroll is an easy framework for capturing them when they do.</h4><figure><img alt=""Two cartoon diamonds walking down a street holding hands"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GSQ6tkvnHslyZNmIzCGbSQ.png"" /><figcaption>Illustration by Liam Oscar Thurston</figcaption></figure><p>Through all the changes I’ve seen in design throughout my career, there has been one constant: Everyone always wants you to go faster. To (maybe) quote Benjamin Franklin, “time is money”. A lot of designers are happy to trot out the old “<a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/the-big-lie-of-good-fast-cheap-fb8905818250"">Good/Fast/Cheap: Choose 2</a>” diagram, bitterly complaining that no one ultimately picks “good” among the options. But failing to keep up is an existential threat. If you can’t design in time, then it’ll be an engineer, or a VP, or an AI agent that will.</p><figure><img alt=""A Venn diagram showing the overlap between good, fast, and cheap"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/1*AzquVdt_kEV2er75dKFjwg.png"" /><figcaption>I made this diagram quickly and cheaply. As a result, it kind of sucks.</figcaption></figure><p>As someone who reacts viscerally to bad design, I tend to lean a tad towards stubborn when it comes to quality. This means I spend altogether too much time thinking about ways to do design, at quality, quickly. It’s part of the reason <a href=""https://medium.com/loblaw-digital/designing-a-design-system-for-loblaw-digital-a-magical-mystery-tour-37d0b9764601"">I like design systems so much</a>. And while I’m the first person to raise an eyebrow at the latest productivity/ creativity/ diet/ life-hack, I’ve come to recognize something about how I work, and how I assume others do too. I’ve found that my next great idea has rarely arrived on time, or on theme, or during set “creative” opportunities. Instead, they’ve come when I’m knee deep in the work, inside those fabled flow states people talk about where you can “see the matrix” or whatever.</p><p>Being in that state, and having the idea, only to just shrug it off seemed ultimately annoying, and it got me thinking about how it might be possible to pause for a moment, and actually chase that idea down. How would you capture it, and manage your commitments? What steps would you take? Taking a page from Albert Hofmann, I decided to experiment on myself, and ran my very own personal “design stroll”, a playbook for designers to switch gears when the metaphorical lightbulb switched on. In the wake of some success, and a real sense of motivation, I sought to formalize the process, and in doing so I learned about exactly why I found it to be so effective.</p><p>It’s occurred to me that inside of every company, there’s probably someone with a great idea, just sitting on it, for lack of time, motivation, or really anything else. They’re the people who understand the problem best, but maybe they’ve never had the chance (or the permission) to solve it.</p><p>So if you’re a leader, a designer, or a leader of designers, this is my gift to you. The <em>design stroll</em> is a way to catch those great ideas, when they come, still keep your teams going, and motivate your best minds to keep bringing their best to the table. No need to thank me. Just mail me a cheque for 10%.</p><h3>Born to… stroll?</h3><p>The design world already has its go-to go-fast technique, the <a href=""https://www.thesprintbook.com/the-design-sprint""><em>design sprint</em></a>. It’s a 5-day, all-in workshop that pulls the best ideas a team has, focuses on one good one, and works to produce an artefact that can be tested with users by the sprint’s end. When done right, design sprints are an effective way to solve or ideate around a big decision, or even a new product.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*idYxgMivtwIC48RV1n1BSw.png"" /><figcaption>The Design Sprint, from <a href=""https://www.thesprintbook.com/the-design-sprint"">TheSprintBook.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>Design sprints themselves are carefully designed, building on the principles set out by <a href=""https://designthinking.ideo.com/"">IDEO’s “Design Thinking” process</a>. Significant effort by the architects of the sprint went to mitigating specific drawbacks of open-room brainstorming. Namely, that collective workshops suffer from groupthink, bias consensus, and give preference to the ideas of the most senior person in the room (conspicuously it’s not shocking that leaders like doing them). So the design sprint carves out time for individual ideation, anonymizes voting up ideas, and attempts to put everyone on the same page at the start, something Knapp et al call a “beginner’s mindset”.</p><p>But good intentions often suffer from bad practices. In reality, teams aren’t truly afforded the entire time free from commitments, so people drop in and out, often leaving specific team members with the required expertise (designers and or engineers) to manifest and test the artefacts. Success in articulating and defending ideas still hinge on your communication skills, likability, and role in the organization, and since “beginners” lack the nuance inherent in the problems you’re solving, they tend to favour ambitious solutions that an expert would disregard based on a deeper understanding (this is called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect"">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>, where non-experts tend to rate their expertise as greater than the experts rank themselves, ie: you don’t know what you don’t know).</p><p>Did your sprint come up with an app that would do everything? That means you’ve failed. This was just a team building exercise. <strong>If the design process could operate this quickly, wouldn’t we just sprint all the time?</strong></p><figure><img alt=""A still from the simpsons episode featuring Homer inside the car he designed"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/495/1*J4Z5vva4aMCeFdyxLRRpbw.png"" /><figcaption>The outcome of too many design sprints looks like “the Homer” (Copyright FOX)</figcaption></figure><p>By contrast the d<em>esign stroll</em> (a play on design sprint, if that was not abundantly clear) goes all in on two things; <strong>individual effort</strong>, and <strong>expertise</strong>. A <em>design stroll</em> is conducted by a single expert, and realizes an idea or solution from a single perspective. No compromises. That idea gets a shot at being fully expressed before the weight of the group comes to bear. The designer/solver gets their chance at being an auteur. What’s your <em>Citizen Kane</em>?</p><h3>Stroll this way:</h3><p>You can break the whole process down into a few phases;</p><p>1 Business as usual<br />2. The Lightbulb Moment<br />3. Making it real|<br />4. Show n’ Tell</p><p><strong>Business as usual<br /></strong>Imagine that you’re a designer*, working on any given product, knocking things off a prioritized roadmap, doing your best to meld business needs with customer wants. You spend your days thinking about that product, and you understand it really well. Inevitably, (and maybe regrettably) you find that those thoughts aren’t confined to the 9–5. Your brain’s still working in the background when you’re on transit, grocery shopping, lying in bed at night.</p><p><strong>The Lightbulb Moment</strong><br />Pablo Picasso once said “Inspiration does exist, but it must find you working”. And so here, in the midst of your work, something will inevitably happen. You’ll have an idea. Maybe it’s a solution to a specific problem you’re facing, but it could also be an approach, enhancement, or even something that’s on the periphery of the work you do. It’s up to you to determine whether that idea’s worth pursuing. The best ideas for strolls are what you might call “inside the box” thinking. That doesn’t mean they’re boring, just that they’re constrained. It’s probably not the way to go about re-imagining fundamental value propositions, or blocking out the chapters for your first novel. The best strolls ideas are “what-if” moments that could actually happen.</p><p><strong>Making it Real<br /></strong>Instead of putting this idea into a Notes page you’ll only dig up when you’re trying to think of the name of that restaurant where you had that parmesan ice cream sandwich that one time, you’re going to want to prove out your idea. You might not even know fully how you’ll bring it to life just yet, or all the edge cases that might present themselves, but you won’t know until you try. Herein is the hardest part of the entire <em>design stroll</em>– taking the time needed to flesh out your idea. More on this later.</p><p>You shouldn’t attempt anything you can’t bring to life in a few days. Remember that you’re proving the concept, not shipping it. You’re also working from your lone perspective, the director of your own little film. That doesn’t mean you can’t engage a colleague who’s an ace at prototyping, or a copywriting superstar to help you deliver the best version.</p><p>Your output could be a prototype, a vibe-coded demo, or even a well-structured storyboard. You’re bringing your idea to life so that others can understand it, and that’s really all that’s important.</p><p><strong>Show n’ Tell</strong><br />By now you’ve created something that does the job of demonstrating the general sense of your idea. Now it’s time to get it out into the world. You’ll have to show people not only how it works, but what value it has. A design crit is a great place to start. If the signals are good, find ways to socialize this with your cross functional partners. Get some feedback. Maybe hold off on emailing it to the CEO. The point of the work you’ve done is to start a conversation.</p><p><em>*really you don’t have to be a designer to do this, just anyone deeply involved and invested in your work.</em></p><h3>The Man who Strolled the World</h3><p>If you’re skeptical, you’re paying attention. Not everyone has the luxury of just stopping their work to chase down an idea. Before you go anywhere, you need permission. Timing’s important. So is managing your workload. It’s important to communicate. A stroll conversation should work like this:</p><p><em>Hey ______, I’ve got a great idea to _________________. Can I spend a few days putting something together to show you what I mean? (Then explain the design stroll, or link them to this article.)</em></p><p>That’s essentially how I pitched my very first “stroll” to my design leader at the time. I’d had a revelation about how we might allow our customers to both perceive and obtain value across our e-commerce platforms. Normally this is an idea I’d just shelve and grumble about, but not this time. Across a span of about four days I put my head down, declined any meetings I could, and put together a demo. I didn’t do it alone. I reviewed it with a skilled visual designer, I conscripted another– a prototyping ace– to help me bring things up to a very narrow, polished expression of my solution. I worked through a few takes of a video walkthrough (one which was going perfectly until the fire alarm went off). I sent the video around to a few sympathetic peers, and then sent it up the chain.</p><figure><img alt=""Two screens from an ecommerce app that show how to complete deals in cart"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jSq9OfmieSDZeF9q1IOxuw.png"" /><figcaption>One of a number of screens I produced in my “value vision” stroll. (Copyright Loblaw)</figcaption></figure><p>To be clear, it’s not like the business hit the emergency stop and pivoted to action on my idea. Nor did I expect it to. What it did do was frame important conversations about value initiatives for the year ahead, and helped to illustrate some important ideas and considerations so folks across functions could align. A few quarters have passed, and pulling things from my initial stroll concepts into my work. Better yet, I’m seeing the work referenced by other folks in the organization to bring planning documents to life.</p><h3>Stroll Lotta Love</h3><p>There are a number of real reasons why I think the <em>design stroll</em> is an effective tool. To explore why, you need to know a little bit about how good ideas form.</p><p>It was Thomas Edison who supposedly said “great ideas originate in the muscles”. With 1093 US patents to his name, Edison isn’t some gilded-age Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson. He means that good ideas come from doing, and not from passively being struck with inspiration. The mental image of someone deep in thought being struck by inspiration, doesn’t really happen. This is the <em>design stroll’</em>s environment, in the muscles, waist deep in doing. That’s where ideas are found.</p><p>In his not-subtly named book, <a href=""https://stevenberlinjohnson.com/where-good-ideas-come-from-763bb8957069""><em>Where good ideas come from</em></a>, Steven Johnson talks about the concept of the “long hunch”, where a vague idea about something slowly forms in someone’s mind over an extended period of time. Eventually through exposure to the problem itself, or the thoughts of others, those hunches combine into a great idea. For Johnson,</p><blockquote>“Sustaining the slow hunch is less a matter of perspiration than of cultivation. You give the hunch enough nourishment to keep it growing, and plant it in fertile soil, where its roots can make new connections. And then you give it time to bloom.”(78)</blockquote><p>Long hunches feed the <em>design stroll</em>. On the occasion when one hunch crashes into another and makes a good idea, it’s time for the <em>design stroll</em> to begin.</p><p>For Daniel Kahneman, author of <a href=""https://dn790002.ca.archive.org/0/items/DanielKahnemanThinkingFastAndSlow/Daniel%20Kahneman-Thinking%2C%20Fast%20and%20Slow%20%20.pdf""><em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em></a>, there are two (metaphorical) systems of thinking. System 1, which is automatic and intuitive, and System 2, which is more effortful and logical. When it comes to ideation, the two systems interact, taking System 1’s creative “aha” moments and putting them into practice in practical ways with System 2. Kahneman also stresses that System 1 thinking often relies on bias, and that fundamentally humans aren’t very good at being right when it comes to intuitive guesses, because we’re so easily swayed by things around us. Fast thinking (System 1) makes it easy for someone to focus on the wrong thing, with Kahneman suggesting that “when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution”. (12)</p><p>Here’s where the stroll shines. A stroll lets you wait for the right time to take action. We’ve all been in a situation where we’ve been presented with a problem, and without much thinking, answered it, only to have our response quickly put on the scrap heap. “Yeah. We tried that, and no.” That was your overconfident System 1 talking. The <em>design stroll</em> gives System 1 and 2 time to battle it out, and that means that the solution is much higher quality than the one you’d have if you’d been thrown onto a team during a hackathon, etc.</p><p>Even the creators of the sprint, Jake Knapp &amp; co. acknowledge the facts. In contemplating why (pre-sprint) brainstorming sessions weren’t working, they write:</p><blockquote>“Individuals were still thinking up ideas the same ways they always had– while sitting at their desks, or waiting at a coffee shop, or taking a shower. Those individual ideas were better.” (Sprint, 2)</blockquote><p>The stroll is centred around individual contribution, and it puts individual perspectives to the test before they get shot down. How many times have you had an idea that you just couldn’t communicate well enough to show folks the bigger picture? The stroll is laser-focused on cultivating these ideas so they aren’t lost, missed, or ignored.</p><h3>Stroll with it</h3><p>If you’re a design leader, or really anyone with any influence on process, you’d do well to carve out time for your experts to pounce on an idea when they have it. Someone on your team or in your organization probably has an amazing, well-thought out, money-making/saving, feasible idea that you haven’t heard about. Maybe because you haven’t asked. Make the time and space for ideas to be developed when they strike, and never let another good idea go unspoken again. Not every stroll will be the next big idea. <strong>Some might be small good ones.</strong></p><p>Implementing strolls in your practice is really about making space in two ways, granting permission, and providing a forum to socialize what gets produced. Designers need to know that they can take time to explore solutions that aren’t on a roadmap. They need trust in the use of the time, and their teams need to make space to enable them, or even assist them if they need it. A good idea no one sees is about as loud as a tree falling in the forest with no one around. It’s important to create forums for stroll ideas to be both heard and understood, by those who can facilitate bringing them to life.</p><p>In the absolute worst case, you’ve lost a few productive hours and energized your team creatively. Giving permission to ideate outside of the confines of work, and listening –if nothing else–provides motivation and a sense of meaning in one’s work (in case you haven’t heard, there’s a bit of a <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/a-crisis-of-meaning-in-ux-design-0831b85a3fb5"">crisis of meaning in design at the moment</a>). Better motivation, better satisfaction, better productivity. It’s a win-win-win. So If you want to find good ideas, find those who are in the work, and when solutions come, let them out for a stroll.</p><p><em>Thanks for reading.

<h4><strong>How to build empathy with users you struggle to understand</strong></h4><figure><img alt=""A lemon speaks to a snake that it is wound up in and the snake looks at the lemon, then looks away, creating a loop."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xMlACuDGr6GAcynCT1JS5Q.gif"" /></figure><p>The digital nomad who is designing an app for the atomic midwestern family. The non-gamer who is designing a videogame UI. The sighted person who is building a touch interface for the blind.</p><p>Empathy is foundational to product design. We talk about it constantly: cultivating it, mapping it, building with it. But what happens when empathy doesn’t come naturally? What do we do when we don’t relate to our users, when their behaviors feel foreign or even frustrating?</p><p>I ran into this problem recently while designing a fitness app. I was stuck until I remembered the first time I’d overcome it: writing dialogue for a cartoon snake, of all things.</p><h4><strong>The Snake in the Room</strong></h4><p>In 2012, I joined Nickelodeon’s new flagship show Sanjay and Craig as a storyboard director. It was a catch-all role: writing, storyboarding, shaping jokes and characters. The premise? A boy and his talking pet snake. The tone? Wild, absurd, full of bodily functions. If you watched kids’ TV back then, you might remember it.</p><p>As we started breaking episodes, I hit a wall. Craig Slithers, the talking snake, was one of the main characters <em>and I couldn’t write him</em>. I just didn’t understand who he was.</p><p>Craig was bold, brash, and loved the spotlight. I was second-guessing myself after a rough project before Nick, trying to quietly get back on my feet. He was all noise and confidence. I, though gregarious, was trying not to get noticed.</p><p>Still, I had to write for him. I needed to understand his mindset, his instincts, his voice.</p><p>I tried outlining his traits. Rereading scripts. Mapping his arc. None of it helped. He felt flat, fake.</p><p>Eventually, I gave myself one small challenge: <strong>find one thing I had in common with him.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""A snake chases it‘s own tail, trying to reach just one connection."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*h3Zok9vKHMsShEqCWMSHdg.gif"" /><figcaption>Though it can feel like this sometimes.</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>A Moment of Product Design Clarity in a Writers’ Room</strong></h4><p>I landed on this line in a script: “Craig was cool. Or, really, he wasn’t, but he believed he was cool.”</p><p>That clicked.</p><p>Not because it was funny. Because I’d been there.</p><p>At different points in my life, I’ve pretended to be cooler, more confident, more capable than I really felt. That little overlap, just a sliver (or slither) of shared emotion, was enough to get me started. Suddenly, I could write Craig. Not because I “got” him completely, but because I understood one emotional truth. From that truth, I could build. I had my “in”.</p><p>This “in” was my opportunity to immerse myself in the user and their needs like how <a href=""https://www.ideo.org/perspective/radical-immersion-for-extreme-empathy"">Julia Benini wrote in her article on IDEO</a>. The process I’d stumbled into is exactly what product designers do every day: observation, questioning assumptions, finding emotional truth, just with real people instead of cartoon ones.</p><h4><strong>Finding Your “In”</strong></h4><p>In UX design, we sometimes treat empathy like a light switch. Either it’s there or it’s not. But real empathy comes in layers. You don’t need to fully understand someone’s life to connect with them, maybe you just need to connect with one emotional truth. An “in”.</p><figure><img alt=""A series of colorful images of the word “in”. This is meant to represent the different ways you might find a connection with you user."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uBxHOH-63utQWxnositdUw.gif"" /></figure><p>That “in” usually comes from research: interviews, fieldwork, usability tests. But even with great data, it can be hard to relate. When users act in ways we don’t expect, we get frustrated. We think they’re confused, irrational, maybe just wrong.</p><p>But they’re not. They’re just not us.</p><p>Instead of asking, “Why are they doing that?” ask, “What truth might explain this?” I didn’t relate to Craig’s confidence. But I did relate to the desire behind it. That was the crack in the door I needed.</p><h4><strong>Staying Curious</strong></h4><p>When you don’t relate to a character or a user, it’s easy to reduce them to a stereotype. Early on, I thought Craig was just chaos. Loud, pushy, needy. But the more I asked questions (what’s he hiding? what’s he afraid of?), the more I started to see the human side underneath the gags. That shift changed how I wrote him. Suddenly he wasn’t just loud. He was trying to seem loud, to cover something up. That made him real.</p><p>Users can be the same. When someone skips onboarding or drops out halfway through a task, it’s tempting to write them off. But those behaviors often come from something relatable: fear, frustration, stress, distraction.</p><p>While designing a fitness app for finding nearby workouts (a freelance project that has yet to see the light of day), I hit my own empathy wall. As someone who prefers solo training and finds social fitness apps like Strava intrusive, I assumed our users would want a clean, private experience focused purely on location and workout type. I designed around that assumption by emphasizing map views and filtering options while intentionally avoiding any social features.</p><p>But user interviews told a completely different story. People didn’t just want to find nearby running trails or hiking spots, they wanted recommendations from people they trusted.</p><p>One user told me -</p><figure><img alt=""An image of a word bubble that reads “I’d rather run a mediocre route that my friend loved than discover the perfect trail alone.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RKBKUcMoPjK2o2bOgm1xfQ.gif"" /></figure><p>There was my in. Instead of seeing social features as noise, they saw them as the most reliable filter for quality recommendations from people they trusted.</p><p>That feedback forced me to view my product from a different angle. Instead of building another map-based discovery tool, we pivoted to focus on trusted recommendations from your network. The core insight wasn’t about finding workouts nearby, it was about finding workouts that people like you had actually enjoyed. We redesigned the entire experience around a “recommended by people you know” social feed that surfaced workouts based on your connections’ activities and ratings.</p><p>Good product design comes from staying curious. Instead of fixing users, we ask what matters to them at the moment. We don’t design for quirks. We design for people. And when you find your “in” to empathize with those people, then you can find the best solution.</p><h4><strong>The Emotion(al) Moment</strong></h4><figure><img alt=""An animated illustration of a snake eating a lemon."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zP8NhzbtO-mmqhgkbrX4LQ.gif"" /></figure><p>In creative writing, “voice” isn’t just how a character talks. It’s how they see the world. That lens makes them feel real.</p><p>In product design, we tend to focus on goals and tasks. But great design also reflects how users feel in the very moment they engage with a product.</p><p>Did they miss their coffee? Are they exhausted from their newborn baby? What were they hoping for, and is the product delivering that?</p><p>Users don’t come to our products as blank slates. They bring their full emotional lives with them: stress, distraction, hope, exhaustion. When we find our “in” to that emotional reality, we can design for their actual headspace, not an idealized version of it.</p><p>Empathy should show up in every interaction, not just the text.</p><h4><strong>From Snake Scripts to Product Design Sprints</strong></h4><p><a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/i-make-the-lemonade-3a8070ee9bbd"">As I have previously mentioned</a>, my past experience as a storyteller in animation has shaped some of my UX philosophy. Writing Craig taught me how to understand someone I didn’t instinctively relate to. It forced me to find connection through questions, observation, and emotion.</p><p>This process made the leap with me to product design and it’s what helped draw me into this new path. In animation, you’re constantly thinking about audience engagement: what makes them laugh, when they’ll lose interest, how to keep them watching. I realized that product design is essentially the same thing, but instead of just entertaining an audience and keeping their eyeballs on your product, you’re helping users accomplish real goals that matter to their daily lives and keeping them engaged. Both require understanding psychology and designing experiences that feel intuitive and satisfying, but product design offered something animation couldn’t: the opportunity to make people’s lives genuinely easier, not just more entertaining.</p><p>To accomplish this we don’t have to become our users. We just have to stay open. Curious. Patient. Willing to look past the surface. If we find that one emotional truth to relate to then we have our “In”.</p><h4><strong>Further Reading on Empathy in UX:</strong></h4><p>If you want to explore empathy in user research further, here are some resources that I’ve found valuable:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/empathy-in-user-research-setting-aside-your-point-of-view-fea438051b0e"">Empathy in user research: setting aside your own point of view</a> — UX Collective</li><li><a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/empathy-a-foundation-of-ux"">Empathy: The Foundation of UX</a> — Interaction Design Foundation</li><li><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/sympathy-vs-empathy-ux/"">Sympathy vs. Empathy in UX</a> — Nielsen Norman Group</li><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/ux-research-methods-and-the-path-to-user-empathy-81f912d5845a"">UX research methods and the path to user empathy</a> — UX Collective</li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ccf5c61c3f4e"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/empathize-like-they-are-a-cartoon-snake-ccf5c61c3f4e"">Empathizing with a cartoon snake</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h3>Ornament and culture</h3><h4>Interface as social signifier.</h4><figure><img alt=""An image of Loos’ Villa Müller, a stern but pleasing brutalist structure."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/750/1*q8mr2nGaRzDOf5x2BSnnjA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Villa Müller in Prague by Adolf Loos, 1928–30.. © Flickr User adamgut, licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0</figcaption></figure><p><strong>In 1913</strong>, at the height of the <em>Art Nouveau</em> movement, Adolf Loos, an architect and theorist, was appalled and aghast. Everywhere he looked, ornamentation was spoiling his beloved Vienna.</p><p>Loos was a believer in the future. Inspired by his visit to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_Columbian_Exposition"">Chicago World’s Fair</a>, he became a devotee of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Sullivan"">Sullivan</a> mandate of “form follows function”. In Loos’ eyes, the old world, with its dedication to complicated folk art adorning every surface, was dying. The industrial revolution, and the arrival of automated systems and management of humans, promised a new frontier. Gone was the old folkways of handcraft and guilds. Loos, like many intellectuals of his day, saw this as a pivotal evolutionary fulcrum for humans, and he was excited.</p><p>The world at the time was reeling, as the industrial revolution had thrown labor, economics, politics, and yes, even art and design, into a delirium. The value of what it meant to be a human was up for debate. What was the value of a human when these machines could do all the work? What was a craftsperson’s role when industrial factories could make well-designed chairs, shoes, posters at a scale heretofore unheard of?</p><p>Loos took it upon himself to publish a version of a talk he had been giving in salons for years, and he entitled the manifesto, “<a href=""https://www2.gwu.edu/~art/Temporary_SL/177/pdfs/Loos.pdf""><em>Ornament and Crime</em></a>”. It remains one of the most famous nearly-political polemics on architecture and design in the last 100 years, and some credit it with being the foundational text for the <a href=""https://www.metmuseum.org/essays/the-bauhaus-1919-1933"">Bauhaus movement</a>.</p><p>In it, he takes square aim at the idea of ornamentation of <em>any</em> type. To bolster this, Loos presents two main arguments:</p><ol><li>Ornamentation takes too long for workers to make at scale, and gives no real value.</li><li>Ornamentation is strictly the domain of “degenerates”, and much like natural selection smooths a species to only its most essential shape, so too must design prioritize essential function alone.</li></ol><p>Loos takes very little time in the essay to turn his association with artful decoration into racist tropes. (<em>“Are we alone, the people of the nineteenth century, supposed to be unable to do what any Negro, all the races and periods before us have been able to do?”</em>) But putting aside the casual association Loos makes between evolution and eugenics, Loos really reveals himself in this passage:</p><blockquote>“Ornament does not heighten my joy in life or the joy in life of any cultivated person. If I want to eat a piece of gingerbread I choose one that is quite smooth and not a piece representing a heart or a baby or a rider, which is covered all over with ornaments. The man of the fifteenth century won’t understand me. But all modern people will.”</blockquote><p>It is 2025, and Loos’ ideas are again ascendant. If I have one overarching mission in these design essays, it’s to communicate that history doesn’t repeat exactly, but it gets pretty darn close. We cannot know the future, but using the past as a guidepost is usually a decent starting point for figuring out which way to go.</p><figure><img alt=""App store screens of two different apps: one on the right, very plain and minimlists.

Once again, technology has arrived which gives everyone pause. Once again, some welcome this as a utopia ascendant, and some are much less convinced. And just like that period roughly one hundred years ago, we are now struggling again with what it means to be a human in a world of new technology.</p><p>For some, like Loos, the winnowing and removal of ornament is the logical end point of a kind of post-humanist ideal. Into this thought space steps a style labeled digital <em>minimalism,</em> but I would call a kind of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurism"">neo-futurism</a>, as at its base it is not about the removal of distraction, but actually about a removal of the human from the process. The design style is distinctly and <a href=""https://apps.apple.com/us/app/synctasks/id6575384261"">intentionally</a> <a href=""https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pushr-push-up-workouts/id1587610077"">inhuman</a>, and like Loos, it finds unnecessary ornamentation to be appalling and gaudy. The elevation of AI in this design space is paramount, and why not? AI is trained on humans, but it is better, less messy (at least, that’s the promise). And you don’t need to be a statistician to notice who champions this style.</p><p>On the other side of the spectrum, an interface style is emerging that is a total rejection of this philosophy. Heavily influenced by the over-design of video games, it leans very strongly into ornamentation and hand-craft, a modern day <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_movement"">Arts &amp; Craft movement</a>. In these circles, the simulation of the hand-crafted is the ideal. <a href=""https://tru-tone.com/"">Textures</a>. <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Niki.Cute.Notes.App"">Hand drawn</a> effects and animation. An intentional overwhelm <a href=""https://partiful.com/"">of ornamentation</a>. All of which are microflags for humanity, crying out, “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Kawara"">I’m still here</a>!”. In these circles, AI is denigrated. It is an untrustworthy cash grab by duplicitous companies who don’t want to pay more.</p><p>That these two schools sit in co-ascendance is not a coincidence, I think. (<em>And I should hedge and say that I am not against “minimalism”, per se — there are </em><a href=""https://www.christophniemann.com/""><em>very human versions</em></a><em> of minimalism!</em>) Much like the fraught tension between the futurists and the practitioners of Art Nouveau, so too we see our own versions of these battles, but rather than in intellectual salons around Vienna, the battle is being fought in our pockets.</p><figure><img alt=""A rectangular brutalist concrete sculpture in the desert"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fKFgfK9ovgKXppzCmrXvuA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>One of Donald Judd’s Untitled series, 1980–1984, <em>Wikimedia Commons</em></figcaption></figure><p>There is also another deeper element at play, and one I am reluctant to address, as it seems nearly to rupture any shared understanding of what “design” actually is for. But I would be deeply remiss if I didn’t bring it up.</p><p>Designers like to imagine they’re the spiritual heirs of modernism — rational, progressive, moral. But that’s just a story we tell ourselves.</p><p>For as long as I have been in design, I have been told by my betters that design is not art. And at a surface level, this is correct. Every first-year design student is given Dieter Rams as the ur-designer. They are shown his designs as temples to purpose over appearance. His designs are function over form, with nothing unnecessary cluttering the object. But we mistake taking a position for unassailable truth. Rams’ designs were actually polemics. If you listen to Rams talk, his designs are not meant to be neutral, but meant to be taken as a statement. He believes we as a species are wasteful and foolish. His designs are meant to communicate a point of view. This is not neutral “design thinking”. It is Calvinism by any other name, posing as a calculator.</p><p>Whether we admit it to ourselves or not, design is having a conversation with the user, and having an opinion in that conversation. Much like hack comedians who retreat to the “It was just a joke!” line when called out, I think it’s time product designers stop hiding behind the neutrality qua “we’re just solving problems” stance that has been a fig leaf for far too long.</p><p>I would place any wager that most people spend more time touching and gazing at interfaces on their phones than their loved ones. As such, the items we touch and look at every day are heavy with a point of view of the interface creator. When we build things, we make thousands of micro-decisions, and while our best intentions may cry out for user input, this is not the way humans are built. Our biases, our feelings, our politics will move our hand, as sure as the wind carves a canyon, bit by bit.</p><figure><img alt=""A page from a survey of architecture gothic architecture elements.

Historians can argue the footnotes if they like, but Loos’ work, and the work of like-minded futurists, fertilized the philosophical soil that 1930s fascism took root in. When a design philosophy labels the distinctly human as “degenerate” or “primitive”, it subtly shifts the Overton window on the value of humans themselves. When we try to discard the hand-crafted, we throw out the hand itself.</p><p>We are sadly in a similar moment. The human is being degraded as unnecessary, a thing of the past. Just like one hundred years ago, there are powerful people in this world, with enormous sums of money, who believe this. You must think deeply as a designer, and have a conversation with yourself about what your designs are communicating. Designing in 2025 is making political statements about the future of humanity, whether you wish it were so, or not.</p><p>Design choices are political choices.

<h4>Developing product discovery judgment through psychological safety, collaboration, and systematic practices.</h4><figure><img alt=""Hero image depicting AI-human collaboration: teal circuit board patterns on the left representing AI technology merges with four coral hands reaching from the right representing human teamwork. A lightbulb with leaves and gear at center symbolizes technology and human judgment working together."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rdR9Hv4HENPwDvX4xZEhiA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>How do you develop the judgment to decide what software is worth building when AI makes building it faster and cheaper?</p><p>This article explores how to systematically strengthen discovery judgment, whether you’re building solo or as a team. For background on why judgment becomes the critical constraint when AI accelerates execution, see my previous article “<a href=""https://medium.com/@gale.robins/it-seems-anyone-can-build-software-now-how-do-you-build-the-right-software-182057dfa122"">When building software became easier with AI, deciding became harder.</a>”</p><p>The answer lies not in better tools or more time, but in three interconnected capabilities: psychological safety that permits genuine learning, cross-functional collaboration that surfaces diverse perspectives, and systematic frameworks that make assumptions explicit and testable. These are the human systems that transform discovery from a sequence of tasks into a continuous learning loop where reasoning itself improves with every cycle.</p><figure><img alt=""Venn diagram with three overlapping circles showing how teams develop discovery judgment through Psychological Safety (permits genuine learning), Cross-Functional Collaboration (surfaces diverse perspectives), and Systematic Frameworks (makes assumptions explicit). The center intersection labeled ‘Judgment Development: Compounds Over Time’ shows these three capabilities working together."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/842/1*wFJsuiR4rL7hYAhP9i4diQ.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>Cross-functional teams, comprising product managers, engineers, designers, user researchers, and others, each bring unique perspectives to the discovery process. However, judgment only develops when these perspectives combine. The challenge isn’t getting better at your own function. It’s learning to reason together.</p><p>Solo founders and small teams face the same challenge from a different angle: you must develop these multiple perspectives within yourself. Product thinking, technical feasibility, design usability, business viability, you’re constantly reasoning across all these domains, continually switching contexts rapidly. The practices that help teams combine perspectives also help solo builders systematically develop multifaceted judgment.</p><blockquote>“Psychological safety isn’t about being nice — it’s about being real.”<br /> — Amy Edmondson, <em>The Fearless Organization</em> (2019)</blockquote><h3>The Human Side of Discovery</h3><p>Here’s the thing most organizations miss: judgment doesn’t develop through better frameworks. It develops through vulnerability.</p><p>When you admit “I was wrong about this assumption” without fear, when you kill ideas you love because evidence doesn’t support them, when you pivot after publicly committing to a direction — that’s when judgment grows.</p><p>Amy Edmondson’s research in <em>The Fearless Organization</em> (2019) shows that people learn faster when mistakes are treated as data, rather than a deficiency. Without this psychological safety, discovery becomes performative. Interviews occur, but inconvenient findings are often overlooked. Usability tests run, but only feedback that confirms gets heard. Teams cherry-pick evidence that confirms existing beliefs. Research on software teams confirms that psychological safety consistently ranks among the strongest predictors of team performance and innovation because it enables learning behaviours that improve judgment over time (Obasanjo, 2017). AI acceleration exacerbates this issue, amplifying bias rather than wisdom.</p><figure><img alt=""Comparison diagram contrasting Performative Discovery (ignoring inconvenient findings, cherry-picking evidence, hiding mistakes, unsafe environment) versus Genuine Discovery (examining evidence objectively, seeking disconfirming data, treating mistakes as learning). An arrow labeled ‘Psychological Safety Enables the Shift’ shows the transformation between the two approaches."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1023/1*3ayfvKhZ0XiAKoAHKYrHkw.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>I learned this the hard way. Early in my career, leading product teams, I created an environment where people said yes to my ideas, not because they were validated, but because challenging authority felt risky. A team member eventually told me privately, ‘We built that feature, but no one felt comfortable saying it didn’t solve the customer’s actual problem.’ I recognized that courage immediately; I’d been the junior person speaking truth to power myself. I took the feedback as a gift. That moment taught me that psychological safety isn’t a nice-to-have; it’s the foundation of sound judgment and decision-making.</p><p>The challenge runs deeper than individual courage. Even in organizations that espouse flat structures, power dynamics shape which voices get heard. When product managers treat discovery ownership as <em>exclusive</em> rather than <em>collaborative</em>, engineers and designers stay silent, assuming ‘that’s the PM’s job.’ Senior voices dominate while junior insights go unheard.</p><p>User researchers face a particular challenge: they’re trained in evidence rigour and bias detection, yet their insights often get filtered through PMs rather than informing decisions directly. When research findings contradict existing plans, psychological safety determines whether teams adjust their approach or rationalize it.</p><p>Real discovery requires cross-functional sense-making. A user researcher observes patterns in how users describe their workflow. A designer notices that users are misunderstanding the navigation flow. An engineer sees users accessing features through indirect paths. A customer success rep recalls multiple support tickets about this workflow. A product manager connects these signals to a strategic question about information architecture. None would have seen the complete picture on their own. This is collaborative judgment, different perspectives combining to form an understanding that no single function could achieve.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram showing cross-functional discovery with five roles (User Researcher, Designer, Engineer, Customer Success, Product Manager) contributing different observations that converge on a shared insight: Information Architecture needs investigation. Arrows point from each role toward the center, illustrating collaborative judgment that no single function could achieve alone."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QXW1HAAWn5yoSLX2WNtUEQ.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>Over time, something even more valuable happens. Engineers who participate in discovery with customer success start asking different questions about architecture. Designers who review analytics with engineers propose solutions aligned with observed behaviour patterns. Product managers who examine implementation complexity develop intuition for feasibility. You’re not just contributing expertise, you’re expanding your judgment by exposure to how others think.</p><h3>Expanding Beyond Your Lane</h3><h4>For Solo Founders and Small Teams</h4><p>You might think cross-functional judgment doesn’t apply to you; you’re already wearing all the hats. But that’s precisely the challenge: switching rapidly between perspectives (technical, business, user, design) without systematic practices leads to decision fatigue and blind spots.</p><p>Solo founders often skip discovery practices because “I don’t have time” or “I am the PM and the engineer and the designer.” AI accelerates building, which means you can build the wrong thing faster. Speed without judgment wastes resources at an accelerated pace. The systematic practices below help you develop multi-perspective judgment, compensating for working alone.</p><h4>For Larger Teams</h4><p>Cross-functional discovery can feel uncomfortable.</p><p>As a user researcher, why should you understand technical constraints? As an engineer, why should you sit in customer conversations? As a designer, why should you know about business viability? As a product manager, why is it necessary to understand research methodology?</p><p>Because AI is commoditizing siloed expertise, AI can generate code, create designs, draft requirements, and even synthesize interview transcripts.</p><p>What AI can’t replicate is integrating perspectives across functions to decide what’s worth building. That integration, that judgment, is what makes cross-functional teams valuable.</p><p>This doesn’t mean abandoning your core expertise. It means expanding your contribution beyond your functional lane.</p><p>Start small: Join one discovery conversation outside your usual domain. Ask questions. Listen to how others reason about problems. You’re not abandoning your lane, you’re learning to see the whole road.</p><blockquote>“We can’t let AI seduce us into believing it can do our thinking for us.”<br /> — Brené Brown, <em>Strong Ground</em> (2025)</blockquote><h3>AI as Collaborator, Not Replacement</h3><p>As Brené Brown discusses in her <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/live/zdkKNC4gP1Y"">Fast Company interview</a> (38 minutes) and explores in <em>Strong Ground</em> (2025), many organizations are experiencing what she calls a “collective anxiety about AI”, chasing tools without confronting the human work: vulnerability, truth-telling, and courage.</p><p>This is the challenge of discovery in the AI era: not competing with machines, but building human capacities — deep connection, deep thinking, and deep collaboration.</p><p>So what does this mean for discovery practice?</p><p>After Jobs-to-Be-Done interviews, AI can analyze transcripts in minutes: clustering themes, identifying recurring language, spotting emotional intensity, and surfacing contradictions. It can generate comprehensive assumption maps covering desirability, viability, feasibility, usability, and ethics.</p><p>But AI doesn’t know what matters. It can identify patterns but can’t feel the weight of user frustration. It can cluster themes but can’t sense when an interview reveals something genuinely novel. Recent MIT research examining hundreds of human-AI collaborations found that while these partnerships often underperformed on decision-making tasks, they showed significant gains in content creation tasks, such as generating and synthesizing new content, where humans provide contextual judgment that AI cannot replicate (Vaccaro et al., 2024). AI can’t fully contextualize insights against organizational realities, unstated strategic priorities, the team member who’s burned out, the competitive shift that’s not yet reflected in the data, or a coming regulatory change. Most critically, you decide what’s “good enough” when evidence is sufficient to proceed, when to test further, and when to abandon a direction. These threshold judgments require wisdom that can’t be automated.</p><p>A team identifies opportunities based on customer research—AI analyses which align with strategic outcomes and flags contradictory signals. The team reviews: Does this prioritization make sense given our competitive position? Which patterns might be artifacts of the recruitment process? AI has accelerated analysis; humans make meaning from it. They select an opportunity, AI generates an assumption map, and humans evaluate which assumptions are riskiest, then design experiments to test them.</p><p>This continuous loop, where AI synthesizes and suggests, and humans interpret and decide, creates discoveries that are both faster and thoughtful. But this partnership works best when supported by systematic frameworks that make judgment visible and teachable.</p><figure><img alt=""Circular flow diagram showing 5-step AI-human collaboration loop: AI Synthesizes (analyzes patterns), Humans Interpret (determines meaning), AI Generates (creates options), Humans Evaluate (assesses context), Humans Decide (makes judgment call).

Frameworks matter not because they’re rigid processes, but because they create shared language for reasoning together.</p><blockquote>“Frameworks matter not because they’re rigid processes, but because they create shared language for reasoning together.”</blockquote><p>The principle: your frameworks and tools should force specificity and enable evidence-based reasoning. Jobs-to-Be-Done, for instance, requires what practitioners describe as a fundamental “mindset change,” shifting the focus from product features to the underlying jobs customers are trying to accomplish (Gecis, 2021). Teams can’t hide behind “users want better collaboration.” They must specify: What job are users hiring our product to do? How do they measure progress? What alternatives exist, and why are those inadequate?</p><p>Tools like Opportunity Solution Trees help teams visualize the path from desired outcomes through opportunities to solutions, deliberately slowing teams down to explore the opportunity space rather than jumping immediately to solutions (Corbett, 2023). Similarly, Assumption Mapping forces teams to articulate what would need to be true for their approach to succeed across the dimensions of desirability, viability, and feasibility. Making assumptions explicit surfaces disagreements before they become expensive mistakes, a critical practice given that product teams typically find nine out of ten product assumptions prove false when tested (Podzorska, 2023). Evidence tracking ensures that insights don’t get lost and maintains lineage, clarifying which opportunities are supported by evidence versus speculation.</p><p>Solo founders benefit from these frameworks in different ways. Where teams use frameworks to create shared language, solo builders use them to make implicit thinking explicit — writing down assumptions forces you to examine your own reasoning. Documenting evidence trails helps you catch your own confirmation bias. These aren’t just team collaboration tools; they’re personal judgment development practices.</p><p>What matters isn’t which specific frameworks or tools you adopt, it’s ensuring your discovery process produces the insights and evidence required for sound judgment and decision-making.</p><h3>You Don’t Need Permission to Begin</h3><p>Change doesn’t have to wait for mandates or executive buy-in. It can start with just one person choosing to work differently. Informal leaders, individuals without formal authority, consistently spark real change through a shared vision, reciprocal relationships, and an emphasis on process.</p><p>When your work demonstrates more explicit reasoning and better outcomes, others notice, whether “others” refers to your team, investors, customers, or future collaborators. This isn’t passive “leading by example”, it’s intentional demonstration. Become the person who consistently asks the right questions, who can articulate why a direction is worth pursuing with evidence rather than conviction. As Brené Brown observes, “Courage is contagious.” When you make your reasoning visible, admit when you’re wrong, and kill your own ideas based on evidence, that vulnerability invites others to do the same.</p><p>Here’s why starting now matters: as AI speeds execution up and lowers costs, judgment becomes exponentially more valuable. The talent market is segmenting professionals who use AI to execute faster while thinking the same way, versus professionals who use AI to amplify their judgment, competing on wisdom and strategic value. The latter group becomes increasingly valuable precisely because judgment can’t be automated.</p><p>Speed without judgment isn’t progress, it’s expensive failure at scale. When anyone can build anything, competitive advantage shifts to building the right things. The teams that thrive will be those who learn the fastest, make decisions with clarity, and discover unmet needs before their competitors do.</p><p>You can wait for your organization to recognize this shift, or you can start building this capability now, positioning yourself among the judgment-oriented professionals who will thrive in the AI era.</p><p>Start with one small practice:</p><p><strong>If you’re building solo:</strong></p><ul><li>Document assumptions before building — create a simple “What must be true for this to work?” list.</li><li>After customer conversations, capture what surprised you about your own thinking, not just about customers.</li><li>When you pivot, document why — your future self needs to understand your reasoning.</li><li>Use AI to question your thinking: “Here’s what I learned, what am I missing?” However, remember that AI provides pattern-based analysis, while you provide meaning-based judgment.</li></ul><p><strong>If you’re working in a team:</strong></p><ul><li>Document your assumptions before your next sprint, just for yourself, in a simple document.</li><li>In retrospectives, add one question: “What surprised us about our own thinking?”</li><li>Share your reasoning when someone asks why you made a decision, including what you were uncertain about.</li><li>Invite one person from a different function to your next discovery conversation.</li><li>When you pivot based on evidence, quantify what you learned: “This assumption-mapping session revealed a critical usability flaw before we wrote code, which saved us two sprints.”</li></ul><p>Find allies. One person practising this alone is interesting. Three people practising together across functions is a movement.</p><p><strong>Which practice will you start with?</strong> Document assumptions? Add a reflection question to your retro? Invite someone from another function to your next discovery conversation? Drop a comment below.</p><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Psychological safety and cross-functional collaboration are preconditions for the development of discovery judgment; without them, discovery becomes performative.</li><li>AI acts as a collaborator, accelerating synthesis while leaving meaning-making, interpretation, and final judgment to humans.</li><li>Frameworks and tools like Jobs-to-Be-Done and Assumption Mapping make implicit assumptions explicit and testable, creating a shared language for reasoning.</li><li>Individual practice scales into cultural change: one person modelling the required behaviour and validating assumptions can spark team-level learning and systemic improvement.</li><li>The talent market is segmenting: those who use AI to execute faster while thinking the same way, versus those who use AI to amplify their judgment and decision-making.</li></ul><h3>References</h3><p>Brown, B.

<p>When it comes to beauty, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/is-korean-skincare-better-expert-advice"">Korea is in a league</a> of its own. Glass skin wasn’t created by accident; it’s all about careful, consistent care. But this meticulous approach isn’t limited to skincare — Korea is now bringing the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/kundal-korean-shampoo-hair-treatment-review"">same precision to haircare</a>. Forget miracle shampoos and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/rosemary-oil-hair-growth-benefits"">hair growth serums</a> for a second. This time, it’s treatments. Enter: hairline microblading.</p>



<p>Even if hairline microblading is completely new to you, I’m willing to bet you’ve at least heard of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/microblading-pigment-removal-trend""><em>brow</em> microblading</a>. You probably know someone who swears by it. The semi-permanent makeup treatment is famous worldwide for using tiny needles and natural-tone pigments to mimic fine brow hairs, essentially filling in sparse patches. Some microblading technicians can even create an entire brow from scratch. </p>

<p>Considering its ability to transform a face, it was only a matter of time before microblading made its way to the scalp. If Korea’s hair experts are anything to go by, it’s an excellent way to boost a thinning hairline quickly and effectively, outperforming tedious (and often questionable) hair growth serums.</p>



<p>Here’s everything you need to know about hairline microblading — and how to make it work for you.</p>



<h2>First of all, what causes a thinning hairline?</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.ukhairconsultants.com/eva-proudmans-clinics/"">Eva Proudman</a> FIT IAT, a leading consultant trichologist, says the hairline is the only place on our bodies that retains ‘baby’ or vellus hairs — essentially finer, wispier strands — so shedding there can appear more noticeable. A handful of factors can trigger hair shedding, also known as telogen effluvium. Think: hormonal shifts, stress, illness, weight loss, certain medications, and even high-tension hairstyles, like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/09/11521323/sofia-richie-sleek-bun-hair-style"">slicked-back buns or tight ponytails</a>. </p>



<h2>What is hairline microblading, and what are the benefits?</h2>



<p>Among professionals, hairline microblading is commonly referred to as scalp micropigmentation (SMP), says Proudman, who recommends it in the right circumstances. “It involves medical tattoos being applied to the scalp as small dots to give the illusion of follicles and hair.” Hairline microblading can be effective for certain types of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/drinking-matcha-hair-loss-thinning"">thinning and hair loss</a>, adds Proudman, and it’s often used to disguise small areas rather than provide full coverage — but not everyone is qualified to perform it.</p>



<p><a href=""https://karenbetts.com/"">Karen Betts</a>, an authority in permanent makeup treatments and founder of Karen Betts Clinics, says hairline microblading requires a highly experienced hand. “Brow hairs are shorter, coarser, and more structured, but hairline hairs around the temples grow more sparsely and lie flatter,” she explains. As such, hairline strokes need to be softer, more diffused, and carefully placed to blend seamlessly with existing hair, adds Betts. Thanks to ultra-fine needles, it’s now easier to replicate fine hairs with ink, but it’s still essential to choose a practitioner who’s properly qualified in scalp microblading. </p>

<h2>What are the risks or challenges associated with hairline microblading?</h2>



<p>If TikTok is anything to go by, hairline microblading might seem like a miracle solution for those experiencing thinning, but it’s not without its downsides. Firstly, your skin type matters. Betts explains that some people have thinner scalp skin than others, which requires a much lighter touch to avoid irritation or tattooing too deeply — again, why it’s important to go to someone qualified to work on the scalp and who knows their stuff. </p>



<p>If your scalp tends to be oilier, this can blur the pigment, adds Betts, making hair strokes appear unnatural and affecting how long they last. Then there’s the color choice and stroke direction, all of which matter for seamless, natural results. Betts adds that for clients with darker skin tones, there may not be enough contrast between the pigment and the skin to show fine detail. “In these cases, the effect will look more like shading rather than distinct hair strokes,” she says. </p>



<p>Proudman warns that, like brows, the hairline is very visible. “Getting something that is too heavy or obvious, or sits below the natural hairline, is simply not a good idea, and you may come to regret it,” she says. Ultimately, hairline microblading should be a collaborative process with your chosen artist. “If there’s any uncertainty about how the skin will take the pigment, it’s wise to do a test area first to see how the color holds,” says Betts. “Pigment may also fade unevenly if the strokes aren’t applied carefully,” she adds. Betts emphasizes the importance of choosing a qualified professional and says it’s all about patience and restraint, enhancing the hairline in a subtle way, rather than trying to completely transform it.</p>

<h2>How does hairline microblading compare to hair growth treatments like minoxidil?</h2>



<p>While hairline microblading is popping off on TikTok, Betts isn’t entirely sure the trend will stick around. But given its growing number of fans, she suspects it’ll fare better than some other semi-permanent tattoo trends: “Think blush, freckles, or lining eyeliner and lips with white shades,” she says. “I’ve tried all of those and they don’t age well.”</p>



<p>If microblading doesn’t sound like one for you, Proudman says there are a number of treatments for the hairline. First up: Minoxidil, also known as Rogaine, which is clinically proven to stimulate hair growth and slow hair loss. “Diet also matters,” adds Proudman. “Make sure yours is packed full of protein.” You might also want to consider supplements to correct nutrient deficiencies, says Proudman. Ask your doctor for bloodwork to see if you’re deficient.</p>



<h2>How long does hairline microblading last, and how much is it?</h2>



<p>Hairline microblading isn’t a one-and-done treatment; you might require a few sessions. While the results typically last anywhere between 12 to 18 months, Proudman suggests being prepared for maintenance: “This procedure isn’t permanent and will need care and attention,” says Proudman, including aftercare like keeping the scalp clean and moisturized, avoiding direct sun, and scheduling touch-ups throughout the years as the pigment fades. </p>



<p>Hairline microblading isn’t cheap. While the cost largely depends on the size of the area you want to treat, it can vary from clinic to clinic and, at the very least, is likely to start around $1,500. Top-ups will be cheaper.</p>

<h2>How else can you get your hairline back?</h2>



<p>Regardless of the treatment you choose, if your hairline is thinning, Proudman suggests getting a full, professional diagnosis from a trichologist or doctor first. “This will answer what condition you have. Is it stable or progressive? Can it be recovered? If so, to what extent?” asks Proudman. If the hairline isn’t stable or can be improved with treatments, she recommends waiting to see how things settle before opting for microblading. “In the end, this might not be necessary,” says Proudman, or worse, “it may become obvious once the hair grows in.” </p>



<p>At the end of the day, do your research thoroughly before opting for trending treatments like these — they may fade eventually, but you’ll be living with the results for a long while.</p>

<p><strong>Welcome to “</strong><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/whats-good""><strong>What’s Good</strong></a><strong>,” a column where we break down the soothing, distracting, or just plain good film and TV with a “rooting for everybody Black” energy. This edition is all about </strong><em><strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irXTps1REHU"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Eternity</a></strong></em><strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irXTps1REHU"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">, starring Da’Vine Joy Randolph</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XiI_wkZ6Ac"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miles Teller, Elizabeth Olsen</a> and <a href=""https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/callum-turner-interview"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Callum Turner</a>, in theaters on November 26. I spoke to Randolph about the film below.</strong></p>



<p><strong>What’s Good? </strong><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/11/11599737/davine-joy-randolph-the-holdovers-awards-interview"">Da’Vine Joy Randolph</a> is <em>so</em> good in everything she’s in, you just know if she shows up, the movie or TV show is going to be <em>really</em> good just by virtue of her presence. And there’s a <a href=""https://a24films.com/films/eternity"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">moment in </a><em><a href=""https://a24films.com/films/eternity"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Eternity</a></em> — like in every movie where Randolph plays a supporting character — where you start to miss her when she’s not around. It comes after Larry (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2015/08/91932/miles-teller-esquire"">Miles Teller</a>) has died and gone to the Junction, the place where you have a week to pick where you want to spend eternity with the help of your Afterlife Coordinator (AC). Larry’s AC is Anna (played by Randolph) and from the moment they are thrust together in this delightfully bizarre and hilariously morbid setup, they are magic together.</p>



<p>Anna immediately clocks that Larry, a curmudgeonly old man transported back to his younger self, is in for a tough ride. His wife, Joan (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/elizabeth-olsen"">Elizabeth Olsen</a>) is also dead and has to choose who to spend her eternity with: Larry or her first husband, Luke (Callum Turner). Luke died a war hero and has waited 60 years for Joan to come back to him. He’s also incredibly handsome (see Callum Turner). It’s hard to root for Larry in this scenario — Joan and Luke are long lost lovers reunited after he died tragically! And he’s so hot! — and Anna knows this. She tows the line between gently ribbing Larry about his competition and being the support he needs while he tries to win his wife back. Anna, the character, could easily fall into the magical negro trope, a one-note sidekick there in service of the white lead, but in Randolph’s hands (and thanks to her hysterical dynamic with Joan’s AC Ryan played by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/bejohnce/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">John Early</a>), she’s more than that. Anna is the film’s constant comedic relief, and she’s also its moral center, a grounding force that’s there to remind Larry of the life he built with Joan for decades, while making us laugh repeatedly. That’s the power of Da’Vine Joy Randolph. </p>



<p><strong>Who It’s Good For:</strong> One of my biggest pet peeves is when people mislabel a movie a “romantic comedy” when it is not, in fact, a comedy at all. I’m looking at you, anyone who calls <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/04/9697003/love-and-basketball-20th-anniversary-gina-prince-bythewood"">Love &amp; Basketball </a></em>a rom-com. It’s a beautiful romantic <em>drama</em>, and that’s OK! Not everything that includes a love story is a rom-com, especially if it’s not even remotely funny (cough, <em><a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7536286483540610335?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Materialists</a></em>, cough). <em>Eternity</em> is exactly as billed, a true romantic comedy that is very funny, thanks in large part to Randolph and Early. If you love rom-com classics like<em> It Happened One Night,</em> <em>The Philadelphia Story</em>, and <em>Notting Hill,</em> you’ll love <em>Eternity</em>. </p>



<p><strong>How Good Is It?</strong> There are a lot of things to love about <em>Eternity.</em> Teller and Olsen are operating at their highest, being charming and adorably clueless as old folks in young, beautiful bodies. They do their best work playing off of one another, and the familiarity that comes with building a lifetime with someone feels real. Turner is also great, playing the dashingly handsome hero with emotional depth. A romantic love triangle is as good as the difficulty of the choice, and in this case, the choice is <em>hard</em>. Ultimately, <em>Eternity</em> is about the nostalgia of young love vs. the coziness of a long marriage. Which one would you choose? And if you could choose when, where and with whom you are happiest, do you know yourself enough to answer honestly? </p>



<p>The film is full of those big, lofty questions and when I talk to Randolph about it, you can tell she’s had some time to think of the answers. Along with talking about where she’d spend eternity, her chemistry with Teller, and what life is like after <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpGA2B_AgYw"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">winning an Academy Award</a>, Randolph shared the details on Anna’s magnificent wigs and her newfound status as a <a href=""https://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/slideshow/2961627/davine-joy-randolph-best-red-carpet-fashion/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">red carpet style icon</a>. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11943965.png?width=1024&amp;height=686&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A343"" /></figure>



<p><strong>Refinery29: I have to ask you one of the central questions of this film: at what age do you think you were at your happiest?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Da’Vine Joy Randolph: </strong>Now, to be really honest. I think it just keeps getting better the more that I work on myself and be true to myself and the things I want to do and doing that work, the work of being in alignment and true to myself. I then bring other people and attract other things — job opportunities, people —  that are also in alignment, and there’s that inner glow-up that comes the more that we are true to ourselves, everything else around you just starts to fall into place, and abundance comes your way. It doesn’t mean that things don’t become difficult or not everything goes your way, but how you handle it, how you navigate it, and bounce back, it hits different. I would say now, and I hope that if somebody asks me again [in the future], it’ll be then that I’ll be my happiest.</p>



<p><strong>The film also tackles this idea of what climate, what environment would you want to live in forever. So what eternity would you choose? </strong></p>



<p><strong>DJR: </strong>I’ve been telling everybody that mine would be a luxury yacht, Mediterranean cruise with all the spa amenities. I just think of idyllic summers that I’ve had where I’ve been fortunate enough to be in Spain or Italy or South of France, Greece, that whole Mediterranean. It would be phenomenal.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>There’s that inner glow-up that comes the more that we are true to ourselves, everything else around you just starts to fall into place, and abundance comes your way.</p><cite>da’vine joy randolph</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>A cruise is an interesting choice! I’m not a cruise person, but I get it.</strong></p>



<p><strong>DJR:</strong> I’ve never done a cruise in my life! But I like the idea of getting to hit [different spots] because I’m a Gemini. I can’t pick one. So I like the idea of we’re doing the Mediterranean, we make stops along the way. I get to get out, get to do things. Because otherwise, if I picked one eternity, I would not be a good candidate for that. I would be spazzing out because I don’t think I could do one thing for the rest of my life or eternity.</p>



<p><strong>It was stressful watching the movie thinking about what I would pick! So we’re all about astrology at Refinery29 and  you mentioned you’re a Gemini. What star sign could you spend eternity with and one you absolutely couldn’t?</strong></p>



<p><strong>DJR:</strong> Hmm, see, I’ve always dated people who are the polar opposite of me. It just happened that way. I’m a Taurus Gemini because I’m the 21st so I’m a cuss baby, and I genuinely have both strongly in me. I would say maybe for what I wouldn’t do… I don’t know, because the Gemini in me can get along with everybody. But to be with, I think long term, a Leo or Cancer would get a bit much. Like you’re talking about eternity, but maybe like a Libra or Virgo would be a good one to be with, because it’d be like the ying to the yang. If I’m in my Gemini mode of being all over the place, they can be the checks and balances and organize and keep it all together.</p>



<p><strong>I’m married to a Libra, so, yeah I would recommend [</strong><strong><em>laughs</em></strong><strong>].</strong></p>



<p><strong>DJR: </strong>They ‘gon make sure the house is good!</p>



<p><strong>This is a romance and I’m sure there’s going to be a lot said about the chemistry between Miles, Elizabeth and Callum but my favorite part was the chemistry between you and Miles Teller, your characters Anna and Larry. How did you two develop that and why do you think it worked?</strong></p>



<p><strong>DJR: </strong>We have the same agent. We had had conversations from afar, like Miles was talking to her and I was talking to her separately saying we should work together. He went to NYU, I went to Yale. We kind of had the same educational upbringing in regards to acting. We’re both from Philadelphia. There were those things in place, but we lucked out. I always say the casting is integral, but it’s a gamble, because I don’t think people realize that most of the time, we don’t know each other. We’re all in our own little worlds, and a lot of the time what people see [onscreen] is these friendships that blossom — nine times out of 10, it’s because they did a project together. Otherwise they’re not in our sphere of awareness. So we got really lucky that we immediately hit it off. </p>



<p>We respect each other’s talents. What you saw [onscreen] was us both supporting each other and encouraging each other to raise the bar when we were filming. Sometimes miles would be like, “Well, what if we tried this? And I was thinking about this, Are you cool with that?” And I’m like, “Yeah, let’s figure it out.” But it’s weird, because sometimes an actor will be like, “No. Let’s just do what?” So it was a very welcoming, artistic, creative environment. I think we both just felt comfy with one another, and I think that’s why it translated on the screen.</p>



<p><strong>OK, we gotta talk about the wigs. </strong></p>



<p><strong>DJR: </strong>Yes! I’m so excited you’re asking. </p>



<p><strong>Your character Anna is platinum blonde. When we talked about </strong><strong><em>The Holdovers</em></strong><strong> you told me that you “fought tooth and nail” to make sure that the hair was authentic. Tell me about the process for this and getting those wigs right. </strong></p>



<p><strong>DJR: </strong>So during award season for <em>The Holdovers</em>, that was my blonde era and I still wanted to rock it a little bit. We knew we were going to go to ginger soon, but I was like, I want to rock [the blonde] a little bit longer. So my amazing hairstylist, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ub3p3HbVY"">her name is Tai Simon</a>, had been on the press tour with me and she ended up doing this movie. I fought hard to get her on the project, and thankfully, we were able to make that work.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11943967.png?width=1024&amp;height=676&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=256%3A169"" /></figure>



<p>When we were talking about the character, I asked the director, “How long has she been around?” He was like, “I think she’s been around and in this job for a long time. Like, let’s say at least 100 years.” And so my brain then started to think of all of the spans of time as the people come into the Junction. Like when you’re in New York and walking down the street, you’re seeing the latest trends and they’re coming in and she’s clocking it. And so when they showed us the set, at first we were like, we’re going to show a different hairstyle per decade. We really wanted to have fun with it. And then when they were like, well, we kind of want the junction to have kind of a timeless, ‘60s kind of vibe. We were like, “okay, great, we’re gonna go <em>in</em>.”</p>

<p>I knew that I wanted to have a new hairstyle every single scene, every time you see her. I wanted a new look, which is an insane thing for me to ask for, but I knew if anyone could do it, it would be my hairstylist. So Tai and I pulled tons and tons of images and inspo, and we really just planned and prepared. And we used like, five or six wigs, different wigs, and it just took a lot of planning and prepping, and she just worked so hard to make it seamlessly happen. But I knew behind the scenes she was working her butt off to make this work, and she just cranked out. It is the most beautiful hair I’ve ever had in a movie, and now I’m addicted, and I have to have [Tai] for every movie, because it was, it makes a difference. It’s a part of storytelling and she really knocked it out of the park.</p>



<p><strong>Since the last time we talked, you won an Academy Award. Congratulations! Now that you’ve won, is there anything about this post-Oscar life that you’re living that surprised you?</strong></p>



<p><strong>DJR: </strong>No, I didn’t really know specifically what to expect, but I imagined that my life would just become bigger and <em>more</em>, a sense of more on all levels and that is exactly what it has been. I’m from Philadelphia. I’m a very grounded person. And so I just have to work more at maintaining that humility and groundedness, because it affects my work. I don’t think I would do well if I got caught up in all of this, in the smoke and mirrors of it all. I love a good glam and I love getting dressed up. That’s my favorite part. I love seeing other artists and their work. I love the creative mindset. That is what I’m 100% down for. All the other stuff I’m very mindful of what I interact with, because I want to stay in this [industry] as long as possible, and I don’t want to burn out. So it’s a lot more of everything times 10, but I try to really be mindful of what I engage in, so that I can go the distance. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>I just want to encourage all women, but especially women of color, especially Black women, and especially curvy women to wear [whatever you want] and have fun with it, because you’re not going to know unless you experiment. </p><cite>da’vine joy randolph</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>I love what you just wore to the <em><a href=""https://wwd.com/pop-culture/celebrity-news/gallery/eternity-los-angeles-premiere-photos-1238338858/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Eternity</a></em><a href=""https://wwd.com/pop-culture/celebrity-news/gallery/eternity-los-angeles-premiere-photos-1238338858/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> LA premiere</a>. You’ve been called a red carpet style icon. I know when it comes to style and red carpets, Black women aren’t often put in that space. How are your red carpet looks a love letter to curvy Black women?</strong></p>



<p><strong>DJR:</strong> I think it’s a love letter to women and women of color, specifically, because of just what you said. I’m very mindful of how I put things together, how I do my makeup, my hair, the clothes. Because, you know, Charlize Theron could wear this haircut, and it looks a certain way. We do this all the time with hair that we’re like, “Okay, now, if Charlize wore this, what would the vibe be? And if I wear this, what would it be? Different things can get projected onto [your looks]. In no way do I deny who I am and where I come from. I’m very, very proud of it. But there’s also a level of elevating [beauty and fashion] and presenting it in a way that’s not neglectful of who I am, but something that people can digest and get into. There is nothing wrong with you authentically showing up as yourself as well, Read the room, you know what I mean? What I would wear to the Golden Globes is different from what I would wear to the Oscars or what I would wear to a premiere. </p>



<figure><img /></figure>



<p>I’m very intentional, and at the same time, I love to have fun. And there’s something that my stylist said the other day that made me so excited. I was like, “I really like this one outfit and we go on to do London press after this. Maybe we should save it for London.” He was like, “we don’t save clothes, wear them. We’ll never run out of clothes.” And so it’s just about being yourself. Have fun! Don’t be scared and don’t be worried about what you think people are going to think. What I love is that I’m in control of my brand and what I’m putting out there, right? And so that’s really exciting and fun. I just want to encourage all women, but especially women of color, especially Black women, and especially curvy women to wear [whatever you want] and have fun with it, because you’re not going to know unless you experiment. You know how you have some girlfriends where they’ve locked into, like, “purple is my color,” and that’s all they do. Or, like, power suits, and they look amazing in it, but  also just want to encourage women to try other things too, because you might be surprised that other things look great on you too. I really love to encourage a sense of play and going out of your comfort zone because you’re just conquering more territory.</p>

<p>In his recent cold-weather trend report, hair artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tomsmithhd/?hl=en"">Tom Smith</a> predicted that muted mid — essentially “soft, neutral-warm shades that sit between blonde, brunette, and copper” — will reign supreme. “It’s a fusion of all the recent trends, but intentionally subtle and noncommittal,” says Smith. Think Hailey Bieber, Taylor Swift, and Madelaine Petsch — or content creator <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DDsFPXUNEPd/?hl=en"">Zoe Hayes</a> here. Shades like this are low-maintenance, versatile, and chic, adds Smith. “Simply ask for a natural earthy undertone to your shade of choice and maintain it with glossing treatments to keep the finish refined and the color looking shiny and intentional.” We swear by <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fglazehair.com%2Fcollections%2Fsuper-gloss"">Glaze’s Supergloss</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/seanmichaelhair/?hl=en"">Sean Michael</a>, a Boston-based balayage specialist and owner of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thesalonbeau/?hl=en"">Salon Beau</a>, identifies “cherry cola brunette” as the brooding shade to watch this winter. “It’s all thanks to the rich depth and understated hint of cherry tone,” explains Michael, much like this shade on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DMYY3uhofIy/?img_index=1"">Alice x T</a>. “It gives dark hair a moody, polished glow without tipping into a full red, making it a great choice for brunettes who want something new.” Fortunately, cherry cola brunette suits everyone. “Ask your stylist for a deep brunette base enhanced with soft violet-red lowlights or a cherry-toned gloss to create that cola-inspired richness,” advises Michael.</p>

<p>“Honey butter blonde is poised to dominate winter because warm, creamy shades are finally taking the spotlight again,” says Michael. This shade is defined by a “soft candlelit glow” that adds brightness and shine to hair during an otherwise moody season. “To get the look, ask your colorist for a warm-neutral blonde with subtle golden dimension and a glossy finish to enhance that buttery warmth,” Michael says.

Jacob used Schwarzkopf Professional’s Vario Blond SuperPlus and BlondMe Premium Lightener 9+ to create a handful of face-cupping highlights and lighter ends. The pièce de résistance was toning the lengths with Igora Vibrance, giving the color a more effortless vibe.

<p>In his trend report, Smith describes gothic brunette as an “ultra-dark, almost inky brunette with intense depth and shine,” like this color posted to Instagram by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DROY7h_Ebg4/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Ryenne Snow</a>. This shade works best for those with a naturally dark base, he explains, suggesting you ask your colorist for an espresso- or black cherry-toned gloss to take your natural color a shade or two deeper. The darker the hair, the glossier it appears as it catches the light. Look to Margaret Qualley, Kendall Jenner, and Nicola Peltz Beckham for inspiration.</p>

<p>Gonzalez pinpoints golden strawberry blonde as the hair color to watch, thanks to its luminosity and sunshine vibes — something we seriously lack in the drab winter months. “This shade combines the brightness of blonde with copper warmth, creating a glowing look that feels fresh,” explains Gonzalez, adding that it’s great for blondes who want warmth and depth, or brunettes ready to go a little lighter. “Just ask for a warm honey base with golden copper undertones or face-framing pieces,” says Gonzalez. This shade created by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DFFMyfGST6U/"">Sophie Malic</a> is beautiful.</p>

<p>“This hair color technique involves low-commitment demi-permanent glosses that deepen your natural base by one or two levels, while keeping your existing highlights visible,” says <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/treehousehair/?hl=en"">Travis Ogletree</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.moroccanoil.com%2F"">Moroccanoil</a> colorist ambassador. He notes that many of his clients flirt with the idea of going darker but don’t want to lose the effortless, lived-in dimension they’ve built. “An all-over gloss is the perfect middle ground,” says Ogletree. “It adds shine, tone, and depth without feeling heavy.” In the salon, Ogletree reaches for the <a href=""https://moroccanoilprofessionals.com/products/color-calypso-demi-permanent-gloss-cream/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Moroccanoil Color Calypso Demi-Permanent Color</a>. “The Gloss and Cream options are both perfect for this.” Look to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DN-ytYcDZbg/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Rachel Redd</a>’s post on Instagram for inspiration. </p>

<p>“At some point, most of us have said that our hair looked its best when we were kids,” says Ogletree, “so ‘born blonde’ is more of an ideology than a trend because it’s based on what naturally suited you — whether that was bright blonde, sandy tones, or soft pops on the ends.” All you need to do? Bring in a photo of yourself as a child. “Those small details help your stylist recreate a version that feels authentic and flattering,” says Ogletree, who turns to Moroccanoil’s Blonde Voyage portfolio of lighteners, specifically Clay and Cream, to lighten clients’ hair. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPo9gyigrgF/?hl=en"">Marco Gilento</a> nails this shade here.</p>

<p>Schwartz describes light suede blonde as a “luminous,” bright shade that frames the face and adds soft depth through the lengths — think of the way a suede bag subtly glistens in winter sun. “It’s setting the tone for one of the season’s most coveted blondes,” he says.

<p>Michael touts this earthier shade as a “cool-neutral blend” that adds dimension and gives brunette hair an expensive look — much like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DGuKJk4v6TN/"">this creation by @a_knack_yuna</a>. It’s all about the soft, smoky gradient, Michael says. “This flatters a wide range of skin tones and grows out seamlessly, making it perfect for anyone who wants low-maintenance color that still feels modern.” Michael recommends asking your colorist for a neutral brunette base with ashy balayage throughout. “This will create that seamless mocha-toned transition,” he says.</p>

<p>This hair color trend draws from eras past. “It’s a honeyed but muted blonde that feels retro and nostalgic, yet still fresh,” says Smith in his trend report. Perfect for colder months, it adds a subtle warmth. “This works best for natural blondes or brunettes looking to add warmth in a mature, elegant way while keeping depth and medium contrast,” he explains. Smith recommends asking your colorist for a “muted golden balayage” or a warm gloss after highlights to bring richness back into your strands.

<p>Greige occupies a cozy space between grey and beige, says Smith, adding, “It honors natural silver while brightening and warming the complexion.” Greige is a perfect middle ground for those who want to embrace, rather than cover, their natural hair, he notes, while the added richness from blonde highlights keeps it feeling fresh and dimensional.

Like a layered chocolate dessert, it blends deep brown shades with golden blonde highlights through the mid-lengths, ends, and front pieces to create nuance, giving the impression that the velvety, shiny hair has been gently toasted by the sun.

<p>“Muted blonde sits between bright blonde and light brunette,” says Gonzalez. “Think soft beige, sandy, or mushroom shades of blonde rather than high-lift platinum. It balances warm and cool undertones for a gentle ‘lived-in’ effect.” If you have light-to-medium blonde hair or light brown lengths and want to soften your color a bit, Gonzalez says a simple salon gloss can get you there. This color by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DFehTNpzQbw/?hl=en"">Diane Gorgievski</a> is stunning.</p>

<p>Between the shopping trips, flash sales, and donation requests, the holidays are often prime time for scammers. Inboxes can be filled with “urgent” updates and texts about surprise account issues, making it harder to determine what’s real and what’s a trap. The truth? Scammers know that this time of year comes with — distractions, increased generosity, and likely rushing to get things done — the perfect recipe for a slip-up. “The holidays are a busy time for scammers,” says Diedra Porché, Head of Community and Business Development at Chase. “They know people are buying more, booking trips, and making donations, so they often use fake websites, delivery scams, and even phony charities to dupe consumers out of their money.”</p>



<p>At the root of so many scams is impersonation — the art of pretending to be someone, says Porché. “Scammers will impersonate known businesses, financial institutions, or government agencies, alerting consumers to a problem with their account or an urgent issue, to dupe them out of personal information and money,” she says. You might get an email from what looks like your bank, a text from a “shipping company,” or even a call that appears to be from a legitimate number. “Pause before clicking any links or providing sensitive information over the phone,” Porché advises. “When in doubt, hang up and call back at a verified number. If it’s your bank, call the number on the back of your card.”</p>



<p>The bottom line: Scammers rely on urgency, fear, or too-good-to-be-true deals to make you act fast. The best defense? Slow down, verify, and trust your instincts. Here are three of the most common scams making the rounds this season — and how to avoid them.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>1. The Social Media Shopping Scam</h2>



<p>If you’ve ever seen an ad for the latest winter must-have or viral gadget that’s suspiciously cheap, you might have encountered this one. During the holidays, social media scams can skyrocket. “They involve fake ads for popular items, paired with cloned retailer websites that are designed to steal your payment information,” says Porché. The setup feels legit — the branding matches, the photos are crisp — but once you check out, either the item never arrives, or worse, your card information ends up in the wrong hands.</p>



<p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> Always verify a retailer’s legitimacy before buying. “If the deal isn’t listed on the retailer’s official website, it’s likely a scam,” Porché advises. And resist clicking on random ads — some may contain malware that can compromise your personal data.</p>



<h2>2. The Gift Card “Emergency”</h2>



<p>This one preys on generosity (and panic). A text or call comes in from someone claiming to be a friend or family member — they’re in trouble and ask that you buy a stack of gift cards right now. Sometimes, the scammer spoofs their phone number or uses voice cloning to sound convincing (and just like your loved one). “Gift card scams are especially popular during the holidays,” Porché notes. “If someone asks you for a gift card out of the blue, it’s likely a scam.” </p>



<p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> No legitimate person or company will ever ask you to pay with gift cards. Take a breath before reacting to urgent requests, and if something feels off, reach out to the person directly through another channel.</p>



<h2>3. The “Too Good To Be True” Vacation Rental</h2>



<p>Scrolling for a cozy cabin or beachfront villa for the holiday season or for a gift of a trip? Be careful. Property scams often involve fake listings on travel sites offering major discounts — usually on high-demand holiday destinations. Scammers may pose as property owners and move communication to text or personal email, asking for upfront payment via wire transfer or Zelle<sup>®</sup>. “These scams lure holiday travelers with deals that feel too good to be true,” says Porché. Another red flag is when vendors ask for personal documentation or direct payment outside trusted booking platforms. </p>



<p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> Book through reputable travel sites with secure payment options and verified listings. Never send money via wire transfer, Zelle, or cash to someone you don’t know personally.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<p>So, how can you spot — and stop — a scam before it happens? Sometimes, the warning signs are hiding in plain sight. Porché recommends watching for these red flags: spelling or grammar errors in ads or websites (real brands rarely make those), unverified URLs (always look for “https://” in the address bar), pressure tactics (anyone urging you to act immediately to reset a password, send money, or share info is likely trying to manipulate you), and sketchy or no reviews (search the company name with terms like “scam” or “complaints” to see what comes up). And remember: Trust your gut. “If a deal feels too good to be true, it probably is,” Porché says.</p>



<p><strong>How to help protect yourself this holiday season</strong>: Beyond staying alert, there are tools that can add an extra layer of protection. “Digital banking tools have tons of features to help safeguard your wallets from scams during the holidays,” says Porché. Chase customers, for instance, can use the Chase Mobile<sup>®</sup> app to track purchases as they happen and can help you catch unusual activity early. Even better? Chase Credit Journey<sup>®</sup> offers free credit and identity monitoring for everyone — you don’t even have to be a Chase customer. The tool sends alerts if your data appears in a breach or on the dark web, helping you act fast if your info’s been compromised.</p>



<p><strong>What to do if you’ve been scammed:</strong> First, don’t panic — and don’t feel embarrassed. “Scams can happen to anyone,” says Porché. Here’s what to do next: Stop contact immediately with the scammer and document everything — emails, screenshots, or messages can help when filing reports. Call your bank using the number on the back of your card to report the issue, file a police report, and make an inquiry with the FTC. Next, change your passwords across all accounts. Lastly, it may help you feel better and find community (as well as warn others) by sharing your experience, says Porché. </p>



<p>Staying safe this season doesn’t mean being paranoid — it means being proactive. After all, the best gift is peace of mind (and a non-compromised bank account). </p>

<p>Sags, it’s your season! <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/weekly-horoscope-16-november-22-2025-meaning-effects"">From November 21st to December 21st</a>, the heat will be on in our homes and personal lives as we escape from the coolness outside and engage in the cozy vibes inside instead. There is so much to complete from our monthly agendas, and such little time to do it — so we’ll feel the rush to finish up the loose ends in our lives before moving forward into winter.</p>



<p>Sarah Potter, author of<a href=""https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/sarah-potter/sober-magic/9781668652381/""> <em>Sober Magic: Using the Tarot and Ritual in Your Journey Away from Drinking</em></a>, says that “Sagittarius season is where curiosity becomes a compass and desire becomes direction. This is the moment to listen to what lights you up and let it guide you. Let your passion be purposeful. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Sag energy asks you</a> to trust your own vision, widen your world, and choose the path that feels like exciting possibilities. Let it remind you that joy is a spiritual practice and expansion begins with radical honesty.”</p>



<p>Potter suggests the following activities to evoke the essence of Sagittarius: “Say yes to a new experience. This is the time to finally take that workshop, trip, class, ritual, or anything that opens your world. A walk with a fast song, dancing in your living room, stretching like you’re taking up more space. Let it feel good to move! Take one little action toward something that excites you. Don’t overthink it, begin! Tell one truth you’ve been avoiding. Do this with kindness and compassion. Maybe it’s to yourself first. Then, speak aloud if needed. Study something that inspires you; philosophy, magic, mythology, travel guides, anything that awakens a sense of wonder.” </p>



<p>The last month of fall is bringing a lot of clarity to our lives — so grab one more pumpkin spice latte for the road and get reflective. With three out of five of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">the planetary retrogrades</a> coming to a halt, we are going to be able to make decisions and see beyond the veil. Mercury, Saturn, and Neptune are turning direct in the month ahead, offering a new and clear perspective on situations and relationships. We will decide whether to dedicate more of our time to others or focus our energy on ourselves. Take note: Committing to a plan of action will require time and patience.</p>



<p>There may be confusing and ambiguous parts to Sagittarius season, especially with Neptune’s entanglement with the sun. We will have to look within ourselves and move towards what makes us happy, even if it is something as simple as collecting leaves or enjoying a slice of apple pie. The point is that we are making strides to understand our sentiments and strive for fulfillment on a spiritual, intellectual, and emotional level. Our visions are awakening after months of being dormant; the path we choose may take a moment to figure out, but we are taking a step closer to making our dreams a reality — there is nothing more exciting and meaningful than that! </p>



<h3>Key Dates in Sagittarius Season:</h3>



<p><strong>November 21st:</strong> The sun enters Sagittarius, making us more optimistic and willing to learn than before.</p>



<p><strong>November 27th:</strong> Saturn turns direct in Pisces, suggesting we set boundaries with others.</p>



<p><strong>November 29th:</strong> Mercury ends the planetary moonwalk in Scorpio that began November 9th in Sagittarius, clearing up matters from the past weeks.</p>



<p><strong>November 30th:</strong> Venus glides into Sagittarius, making love fun and pushing us to make investments. </p>



<p><strong>December 4th:</strong> The Super Full Moon in Gemini highlights our ability to communicate effectively. </p>



<p><strong>December 10th:</strong> Neptune retrograde in Pisces completes its cycle, allowing us to revisit our dreams from former months and years.</p>



<p><strong>December 11th:</strong> Mercury moves into Sagittarius, reigniting the events of early November for a third time. </p>



<p><strong>December 15th:</strong> Mars swings into Capricorn, giving us power and strength in all that we do.</p>



<p><strong>December 19th:</strong> The New Moon in Sagittarius heightens our intuition and emotions. </p>



<p><strong>December 21st:</strong> Sun enters Capricorn and Winter Solstice occurs, initiating a new season when earthier elements come to life.</p>
<p><strong>Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?</strong></p><p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss_linkback1"">The Final Mercury Retrograde Of 2025 Is Messy</a></p>",
