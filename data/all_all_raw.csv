This simple yet ingenious invention can be considered the first composite in history, illustrating the ancestral intuition that distinct materials, when combined, can become something stronger and better.</p>",

<p>The bold use of frustum-shaped metal exterior walls reflects a contemporary aesthetic. The design initially proposes light steel structures with fiber cement cladding—using modern materials and construction to echo traditional methods, a thoughtful approach. However, we suggest adopting more common concrete structures for the exterior walls to lower technical barriers, enhance weather resistance against wind and snow, and achieve a simpler, more rustic expression that contrasts sharply with the metal roof. We also recommend adding more semi-outdoor spaces in each dwelling to create additional viewing highlights for visitors.</p>",

<p>Set in a quiet residential area, the building was designed with an open space at the opening, with an axis running from there to the approach as the layout plan. A roof with east-west eaves emphasizes this axis. The roof itself was designed with consideration for sunlight reaching the house on the north side, with two roofs of different heights, the north roof being lower.</p>",

<h4><em>How removing friction from creative tools removes the meaning from creative work</em></h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TbMmpNxAhRk0ywBhw_Xo7w.png"" /><figcaption>illustration by author</figcaption></figure><p>Twenty-five or so years ago, one day after school I went to visit my dad at his office. We didn’t have a computer at home at the time so whenever I was around his, I would beg him to let me use it to play with MS Paint.</p><p>I was probably around 7 or 8, and my go-to artwork was a portrait of my him made with the spray tool — perfect to recreate his short, spiky hair and stubble — and I’d make his head ridiculously big and tease him about it. He still has one of these masterpiece in his desktop wallpapers rotation, I’m pretty sure.</p><p>I couldn’t draw much else with the mouse, nothing more complicated than a lopsided house and a tree, so I would ask him, knowing full well he wasn’t the artist in the family, to draw something for me; that day I asked for a dog. He tried his best, but what came up on the canvas was a misshapen thing — a kind of pig-dog hybrid that was so bad it had us laughing for a good while.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bAbEBu0_nMOmt2viK_-_2w.png"" /><figcaption>MS paint GUI circa 1999 (screenshot by author)</figcaption></figure><p>I wasn’t always sure why that random ugly dog had stayed with me for so long, but I see now it was a symbol of the connection my dad and I shared that day. This memory has resurfaced a few times now that there’s so much emphasis on AI image generators — these tools that can (sometimes, for now) create breathtaking art effortlessly yet leave me, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz0oQ0v0W10"">and many others</a>, wondering about their real purpose.</p><p>I’ve been thinking about what it would have been like if instead of just our best intention and some basic tools we would have had at our disposal Midjourney or something else that day, how my request to my dad would have been the same but the result much more different. The quality of the artwork itself is beside the point — the whole interaction and the unexpected moment between us it’s what would have been lost.</p><p>There’s been <a href=""https://philosophynow.org/issues/169/What_Makes_A_Work_Of_Art_Great"">countless debates</a> on what makes art <em>art</em>, why or why not AI outputs can or should be considered the <a href=""https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/08/is-art-generated-by-artificial-intelligence-real-art/"">same as human ones</a>. Now every month we have a new tool we can use, one of the latest being <a href=""https://openai.com/index/sora-2/"">Sora 2</a>, adding no value to the human experience while claiming to ‘democratise’ creativity — an overused phrase that does nothing, if not mistaking access for meaning.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Zz1vLggJm8LYsGkNulSnAA.png"" /><figcaption>Google Gemini UI (screenshot by author)</figcaption></figure><p>From a UX perspective, the process of AI image generation is as frictionless as it can be: type, click, wait and receive what you’ve asked for, perhaps refine it. As ever, the promise is accessibility by letting anyone create regardless of skill, but I would argue there’s a difference between democratising outcomes and democratising the creative process itself.</p><p>With these tools it’s like we’re giving everyone a printer instead of a paint brush, and by doing that, what we’re losing is the struggle and the lessons that come with it, so much so that creation doesn’t even feel like creating anymore.</p><p>When the outputs are automated we’re stripping away the messy, truly generative, experience where actual creativity lives.</p><p>I can’t deny that, in some cases, these programs can spit out objectively beautiful outputs. But as much as those AI images might look right, there’s always something missing: whether it’s the person behind it trying to communicate something they can’t quite articulate, or the surprise and frustration of actually getting your hands dirty with a tool.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tyxcDKSGvU2XD8QihHyCVA.png"" /><figcaption>Gemini’s image created form the prompt “draw me a dog”. Technically much better than my dad’s dog, that’s for sure… but I don’t think I would remember it 20 years from now (image by author)</figcaption></figure><p>If you’ve ever tried Midjourney’s on Discord, you’ll know that the experience is quite far from one of creativity. You’re left to watch dozens of other people’s prompts and outputs stream by, and few will truly experiment since it’s much easier to copy successful formulas when wanting a certain result.</p><p>Or the variation buttons — why struggle with your vision when you can just generate alternatives until one feels “good enough”? I can’t get over how these “creative” tools take away the mess and uncertainty where creativity actually happens, and offload what’s arguably the best part of the process to a randomising algorithm.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nx1xERWbQHABlj3iNGXx4Q.png"" /><figcaption>Midjourney running on Discord (screenshot <a href=""https://aituts.com/adding-midjourney-bot-discord-server/"">source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Looking at the bigger picture, it’s disheartening how as a society we can go from celebrating paintings made hundreds, even thousands of years ago, studying each stroke, letting them tell us a story and move us, to being satisfied with something so fundamentally different.</p><p>The point of art, no matter the category — I believe — is that it’s inseparable from the artist behind it. To an extent we can see the quirks and struggle in every piece, sometimes a message, or at the very least, the personality of the artist. What draws us to art isn’t only its beauty — it’s the artist’s way of seeing that gets captured by all the tiny decisions made while creating it. And that’s what makes art unique and human.</p><p>I am <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/the-design-of-shallow-thinking-4627e254a7b3?sk=d121456de089061f1293e7063524e1b4"">by my own admission</a> a bit of romantic when it comes to oldschool software, but if creativity becomes automated we risk losing the very thing that makes art meaningful — the experience of creating something. Then what’s going to happen to all those “happy little accidents” and self expression, that come with the creative struggle?</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/459/1*sWVduw3OEoS-5uKxL17q4Q.gif"" /><figcaption>gif of Bob Ross’ famous quote “we don’t make mistakes — we just have happy accidents” (<a href=""https://giphy.com/gifs/fail-college-mistakes-rYEAkYihZsyWs"">source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>As designers, we always aim to reduce friction and remove barriers, but watching people use AI tools for art is, frankly, just a bit sad. Scrolling through options until you find a good one doesn’t really scream creative process.</p><p>Recently I had a conversation with someone comparing AI art to electronic music (along the lines of <em>“new technology disrupts an art form, skeptics resist but creativity adapts”</em>). I’m not a musician myself but I think that when you dig deeper, the two situations are quite different in terms of what technology is doing to the creative process: electronic music gave artists new ways to create, while AI art gives <em>machines</em> new ways to imitate creation.</p><p>We should recognise this distinction especially because we spend our careers thinking about how interfaces guide decisions. We know that removing steps from a process doesn’t just make it faster, but it can change what that process <em>is</em>.</p><p>So I keep thinking about this ugly digital dog from 1999, how it might be the most valuable piece of art in my memory, even though — or especially because — it was not perfect and looked almost nothing like a dog.</p><h4>Further reads/watch</h4><p><a href=""https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/ai-is-not-democratizing-creativity"">AI is not “democratizing creativity.” It’s doing the opposite</a> — Brian Merchant<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55Z4cg5Fyu4"">Sora proves the AI bubble is going to burst so hard</a> — Adam Conover<br />Reclaiming Art in the Age of Artifice — J.

<h4>Design doesn’t start with pixels or shapes, but with how the brain perceives color and emotion.</h4><figure><img alt=""A yellow LEGO head with a colorful brain sticking out, against a vertical rainbow-striped background."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MTkEF1AH8tRpG1IR5iNxSA.png"" /><figcaption>Some elements were created using AI. The final image was composed by Maxim Shevchenko-Tymchuk.</figcaption></figure><p>As designers, we all understand how deeply psychology shapes our work. After all, everything we create is meant to be used by people and their perception and experience are what truly define our products. We listen to our users and aim to make their interaction with our products as effortless and intuitive as possible.</p><p>My goal with this article isn’t just to share theories, but to start a dialogue within the design community, to exchange perspectives, challenge assumptions, and uncover new ways of thinking about how design truly interacts with the human mind.</p><p>Before we move on to specific practices and theories, I’d like to set the stage for how we’ll be talking about psychology in design.</p><h3>Psychology is a science</h3><p>In short, <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/psychology""><em>psychology</em></a><em>,</em> according to Britanica, is the science of human behavior, emotions, and perception. For us as designers, it provides a lens that helps us build hypotheses and create meaningful concepts. But I believe it’s crucial to remember that <em>design</em><strong> </strong>is<strong> </strong>neither a result nor a goal only but a process of solving problems, as Design Council mentions it in <a href=""https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/fileadmin/uploads/dc/Documents/DesignCouncil_Design%2520methods%2520for%2520developing%2520services.pdf"">their paper</a>. And this process can integrate methods and theories from many different disciplines.</p><figure><img alt=""A red double diamond diagram representing the design process, with two connected diamonds labeled sequentially: Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/936/0*UBFR6q7A4iVOekRE.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/our-work/the-double-diamond/"">The Design Council’s</a> visual representation of their Double Diamond design and innovation process.</figcaption></figure><p>No matter how appealing our hypotheses may seem, whether they’re based on cutting-edge research or well-established principles, real value for users emerges only when we listen to them, understand what they actually need, and iterate our solutions accordingly.</p><p>So what we’re discussing here is perfect for building design hypotheses but it should never be mistaken for their final proof. Now, let’s examine these concepts of Color Psychology more closely.</p><h3>How our brain perceives color</h3><p>I think we sometimes underestimate the meaning and importance of color in interfaces and design. Yet I would argue that color is one of the most crucial aspects of design itself. I would like support this interpretation with the findings from two scientific paper <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6673893/""><em>Estimation of the Timing of Human Visual Perception from Magnetoencephalography</em></a><em> </em>and <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00674/full""><em>Early recurrent feedback facilitates visual object recognition under challenging conditions</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Our perception of color begins the moment light hits the retina and activates the cone cells, each sensitive to different wavelengths. The signal is then sent directly to the limbic system, the part of the brain responsible for emotional responses.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram illustrating the visual pathways in the human brain."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*WS_-cGEcUotrnrQ2"" /><figcaption>Image source - <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/human-eye/The-nervous-messages"">Britanica</a></figcaption></figure><p>This structure evolved long before the neocortex, which handles rational thought. In other words, our emotional brain reacts to color before our logical brain even gets involved. The limbic system also connects emotions with memory, motivation, and instincts, which explains why color can instantly trigger feelings, associations, and even behavioral responses.</p><p>In other words, our brains have evolved to process color before form or content and, importantly, to do so while bypassing the neocortex, which handles rational thinking.</p><p>This means that before your user even begins to consciously recognize shapes or read text, they’ve already experienced an emotional response to the colors on the screen.</p><p>Of course, in research we’re talking about milliseconds but to me, even a reaction that happens up to four times fasteris a huge difference. It reminds us that color doesn’t just decorate a design; it sets the emotional stage for how users will interpret everything that follows.</p><p>Let’s look at an example. I’ll be showing you a series of illustrative images that serve as analogies for how our brain perceives visual information.</p><h4>Sensory perception of color</h4><p>In the first <strong>0–50 milliseconds</strong> after light hits the retina, the cone cells react to the wavelength — it’s <strong>pure physics</strong>. At this stage, your brain doesn’t yet “know” what happened: <em>the signal has just begun its journey through the visual pathway.</em></p><figure><img alt=""Dark background without content on it."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*566ikSMtMS3wXR8SPB7yQA.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Shevchenko-Tymchuk.</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Primary color processing</strong></h4><p>Around <strong>80–120 milliseconds</strong> after the stimulus, your brain isolates color as a distinct signal. A pure sensation of color forms, along with an <strong>emotional reaction</strong> — because the information is already being processed in the limbic system. <em>You see red. It’s a strong visual stimulus, which is why my element has already captured your attention.</em></p><figure><img alt=""A blurred circular composition with a dark center, a soft gray halo, and a small red area on the left side"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zWPpuLH8_NWA1lF5n5so6g.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Shevchenko-Tymchuk.</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Analysis of shape, contours, and motion</strong></h4><p>At around <strong>150–200 milliseconds</strong>, the brain begins to <strong>calculate geometry, boundaries, texture, and depth</strong>. At this stage, the information is still fragmented. <em>The brain has simply detected a rectangle and a collection of other visual elements,</em> but hasn’t yet formed a complete picture.</p><figure><img alt=""A blurred rectangular shape with a red circle on the left and several black rectangles arranged in two rows on a light gray background, centered against a dark backdrop."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Cygio0MxO1iY0-g_bcZl6g.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Shevchenko-Tymchuk.</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Object and context recognition</strong></h4><p>After about <strong>200–300 milliseconds</strong>, the information is integrated in the associative cortex — this is the moment when <strong>we recognize what we’re seeing. </strong><em>This is probably a notification.</em></p><figure><img alt=""A light gray rectangular box centered on a black background, featuring scattered black letters of varying sizes and a red exclamation mark symbol inside a circle on the left side."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Msmw53t4mBaJQw1hGEIdQg.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Shevchenko-Tymchuk.</figcaption></figure><h4>Cognitive evaluation</h4><p>Only after about <strong>300–450 milliseconds</strong> from the moment you look at the button does the rational process begin.

Something went wrong.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZETQsgl4h4a5pKm9rU_ThA.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Shevchenko-Tymchuk.</figcaption></figure><p>So I’d like you to notice something: by the time you already felt a slight sense of alert from seeing the red color, your brain still needed another 200–300 milliseconds to fully decode what was actually happening.</p><p>And now, my dear designers, I invite you to try a little experiment. Take any interface design and increase the duration of all animations by 250 milliseconds. You’ll instantly feel how even such seemingly tiny time differences can dramatically change your perception of what you see.</p><h3>The reality of color</h3><p>The second aspect of color that absolutely fascinates me is its duality, especially when it comes to how we perceive it. On one hand, color is a subjective experience but on the other, it’s something we can measure with extraordinary precision.</p><h4>The immeasurable side of color</h4><p>We know that every person is unique, and we still can’t definitively prove or disprove whether we all see colors in the same way as Prof. Semir Zeki states in his Lecture on Color Perception. What we do know is that perception depends on the cone cells in our eyes and their quantity and ratio can vary from person to person.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/319a9b559cd834f86cbc166659569f70/href"">https://medium.com/media/319a9b559cd834f86cbc166659569f70/href</a><p>And another mystery remains, how exactly our brain interprets colors, and whether it does so in the same way for everyone. Some people can see more or fewer shades, while others might not distinguish basic colors at all. In very rare cases, some individuals may even experience monochromatic vision, not only due to missing cones, but also as a result of brain damage.</p><h4>The true nature of color</h4><p>Color doesn’t actually exist in nature. Yes, that’s right: leaves aren’t really green, the sky isn’t truly blue, and even an emerald isn’t <em>actually</em> green. All of this is an illusion. Our brain’s interpretation of light according to an article <a href=""https://www.spectroscopyonline.com/view/where-perception-meets-reality-the-science-of-measuring-color""><em>Where Perception Meets Reality: The Science of Measuring Color</em></a>.</p><p>In reality, what we see is not color but light. Depending on the wavelength of that light, the cone receptors in our retina are activated in different ways. The wavelength changes because light reflects off objects and that reflection shifts the wave. What’s fascinating is that this shift is influenced not just by the objects themselves but by their atoms.</p><figure><img alt=""Horizontal gradient from dark purple through green to bright red."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*1QxEAuRmQORL5qkn.png"" /><figcaption>Image source - <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=4639774"">Gringer</a></figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5207327/"">This principle is used by astrophysicists to determine which elements dominate on distant exoplanets</a>: by calculating how specific atoms interact with light. With ultra-sensitive sensors, we can detect even the slightest variations in wavelength reflected from those planets.</p><p>And here’s the key point the atom, the fundamental building block of all matter, has no color of its own. It merely interacts with photons. So, the matter and objects around us are colorless without light.</p><p>So we’ve now touched on the second side of what makes color so fascinating: it’s a sensory stimulus that can be described quantitatively: wavelength, intensity, saturation.</p><p>Unlike many other aspects of psychology, color is something we can measure with extreme precision, minimizing any margin of error in experimental data and making it one of the most reliable subjects for psychological research. Yet it remains a complex phenomenon because, we still can’t fully measure the brain that perceives it.</p><h4><em>The color model I trust most</em></h4><p>At the end of the 19th century, long before Johannes Itten’s theories, Wilhelm Wundt laid the foundation for the psychological classification of color in his work <a href=""https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Wundt/Physio/intro.htm""><em>Principles of Physiological Psychology</em></a>.</p><p>In my opinion, every designer should be familiar with and understand this framework. Wundt was the first to describe color not merely as a physical property of light, but as a set of psychological parameters of perception forming so called “psychological space of color”, defined by three independent dimensions:</p><ol><li><strong>Hue</strong> — the actual type of color (red, green, blue, etc.)</li><li><strong>Saturation</strong> — the degree of color purity, or how much “gray” is mixed into it</li><li><strong>Brightness</strong> — the perceived lightness or luminance of the color</li></ol><p>This concept became the foundation for the later development of these ideas and the creation of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV""><strong>HSV color model</strong></a>.</p><figure><img alt=""Comparison of HSL and HSV color models showing hue, saturation, and lightness/value relationships in 3D diagrams and gradient slices."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*U-kK5AmTp2noWFGJ.png"" /><figcaption>Image source - <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=9445469"">Jacob Rus</a></figcaption></figure><p>Personally, I tend to use this model most often in design, as it gives far greater control over the visual outcome compared to the more rigid machine-encoded HEX or the physically-based RGB formats. HSV allows you to work with color in a way that feels more natural and intuitive, while still providing precise control for subtle adjustments in the final result.</p><h3>The influence of color on humans</h3><p>Let’s now move from how we perceive color to how it affects us — and how we interpret it from a scientific point of view.</p><h4>Emotional response to color</h4><p>We’ve already touched on the emotional component earlier, so let’s start there. <strong>Warm colors are known to speed up reactions and increase physiological arousal</strong>. According to the <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279871278_Color-in-Context_Theory""><em>Color-in-Context Theory</em></a>, warm colors stimulate the nervous system and enhance motor responses. That’s exactly why shades of red, orange, and yellow are so often used for CTA buttons, alerts, and error messages, anywhere we need to grab attention instantly or create a sense of urgency.</p><p>At the same time, the same study notes that <strong>cool colors help reduce stress and create a sense of stability</strong>. Blue and green hues are shown to lower anxiety levels, slow down breathing, and evoke feelings of trust and safety.<br />That’s why these colors are so commonly used in banking, healthcare, and other sensitive interfaces — wherever calmness, reliability, and reassurance are essential.</p><h4>Cognitive response to color</h4><p>We also know that color influences cognitive functions such as concentration, memory, and creativity. In a 2009 study <a href=""https://www.appstate.edu/~steelekm/classes/psy5300/Documents/Mehta%26Zhu2009.pdf""><em>Blue or Red? Exploring the Effect of Color on Cognitive Task Performances</em></a>, researchers found that <strong>blue enhances creative thinking</strong> and promotes exploration of new ideas, while <strong>red improves focus and attention</strong> to detail. This means that through color, we can influence not only the emotional state of our users but also guide their cognitive processes, subtly steering their minds toward the state most aligned with the task at hand.</p><h4>Cultural perception of color</h4><p>It’s important to note that the <strong>psychological response to color is largely universal</strong> among humans, according to <a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/002202217300400201""><em>A Cross-Cultural Study of the Affective Meanings of Color</em></a>, emotional reactions to a color’s brightness and warmth are not dependent on cultural or social context.</p><p>However, <strong>color can also acquire symbolic meaning</strong> such as associations with mourning, happiness, or pain, which are shaped by socio-cultural factors. For instance:</p><ul><li>White represents purity in Western cultures but mourning in China.</li><li>Red is often seen as danger in the West, yet as a symbol of luck and prosperity in Asia.</li><li>Green generally feels positive and natural to most of us, but in Indonesia, it signifies “forbidden.”</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Traffic light with red, yellow, and blue signals above a Japanese sign against a blue sky and green trees."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/690/0*9CILeKbx0ZEaBqIj.jpg"" /><figcaption>Image Source - <a href=""http://www.japantravelplanning.com"">www.japantravelplanning.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>So as designers, we can confidently use color to communicate directly with the limbic system, influencing emotion and attention on a biological level but we must also remain aware of cultural context when using color as a symbol, such as the familiar “traffic light logic” so often applied in interface design. For example, until the 20th century, the Japanese language had no separate word for “green.” All hues between blue and green were described by the same word 青い (aoi), meaning both “blue” and “green”, which has led some lights to be a bluer shade of green.</p><h3>Why every designer should start with color psychology</h3><p>I’m sure these theories form the essential foundation every designer should enter the profession with and keep exploring throughout their career. Because in the end, we are learning to speak emotions with our users, and color is what speaks directly to their emotions.</p><p>In my opinion, many of these principles shouldn’t be treated merely as hypotheses that demand constant validation, but as axioms we can confidently build upon. No matter what you test or how you test it, red will always attract more attention than blue, as I wrote earlier, some things are universal.</p><p>It’s important to remember that unless you plan to conduct research on hundreds, maybe thousands, of participants using brain-scanning equipment, you’re unlikely to reinvent the wheel or to prove, through ordinary user testing, a new universal psychological truth about color that hasn’t already been explored by scientists.</p><p>And yet, that’s exactly where I find beauty in being a designer. Because we work with people, not with algorithms. Our role is to ask, to listen, and to adapt, to consider the socio-cultural context, the personal story, and the environments that shape how your user group perceives both color and design.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e5e6556919da"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-color-reflex-psychology-that-fires-before-you-think-e5e6556919da"">The color reflex: Psychology that fires before you think</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Credit: Anna Lefour</figcaption></figure><p>That’s when I decided to test an idea that wandered in my head for some time: <strong>the synthetic developer</strong>.</p><h3>From synthetic user to synthetic dev</h3><p>The first time I heard about a synthetic user was through <a href=""https://medium.com/@lwowa.creator/synthetic-users-a-tool-for-progress-or-a-step-too-far-2db4e95ebb4c"">a classmate’s article</a>. The idea was simple: instead of interviewing real people, you generate a user with AI and run research on them.</p><p>This simple presentation got me to think: <strong>If we can fake users feedbacks, could we fake colleagues expertise too? </strong>After some research,<strong> </strong>I’ve stumbled across very interesting perspectives on synthetic colleagues, going as far as creating <a href=""https://medium.com/%40popov.anatolii.it/the-synthetic-department-working-with-ai-colleagues-24e77cd2fd1d"">a “synthetic department”</a>.</p><p>Fast forward a few months. I was thrown into a project mid-flight. No kickoff, no discovery, no user research. Only an oral briefing, a vague description of the client’s expectations, and the pressure to deliver.</p><p>Normally, this is when I would turn to developers, to help me clarify what’s feasible, what’s risky, what needs prioritizing. But I used this opportunity to test the value of AI as a substitute: I tried working with a synthetic expert, and created Tim.</p><p>And that’s when you may be wondering: <strong>Is this designer suggesting we replace developers with AI? </strong>The answer is no.<strong> </strong>What I wanted to understand was whether a LLM could<strong> replicate the kind of reasoning developers use</strong> when making trade-offs and spotting risks. Not to take their place, but to help designers explore technical constraints when no human counterpart is immediately available.</p><h3>The experiment: building a synthetic developer</h3><p>Tim was a developer persona powered by ChatGPT, my “synthetic dev”. I chose ChatGPT because:</p><ul><li>It has unlimited use (unlike Claude) which was important at the time for my thesis research.</li><li>It’s the designers most used LLM, according to Designlab’s <a href=""https://designlab.com/blog/the-state-of-ai-in-ux-and-product-design-insights-expertise"">State of AI in UX and Product Design</a>.</li></ul><p>Tim’s job was to act as if he were my colleague, ready to discuss scenarios, constraints, and the structure of the interface.</p><figure><img alt=""A screen capture of the details of the persona called Tim."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9KjqsGBGoFuUbT1E9LIkew.png"" /><figcaption>I built a persona for Tim, my synthetic dev. Credit; Anna Lefour.</figcaption></figure><p>I gave Tim a detailed persona (experience level, tech stack expertise, communication style) blending the experience of my two colleagues: one senior engineer, one junior developer. I fed him the project brief, including tech stack, user roles, core CRUD features, and industry-specific constraints. Then I ran a structured design discussion, asking him to help me on:</p><ul><li>Generation of typical use scenarios for the 3 main screens detailed in the briefing</li><li>Specific technical constraints depending on the sector the product will be used</li><li>Hypothetical zoning of screens</li></ul><p>Later, I ran the exact same exercise with the two actual developers from my team. Same questions, same format, same project brief.</p><p>The contrast was striking.</p><h3>What the synthetic dev got right (and wrong)</h3><p>Tim excelled at certain tasks. He helped me structure three Jobs To Be Done when I was struggling to articulate user needs clearly. He proposed a data model that anticipated change logs requirements I hadn’t considered (<em>example 1, see image below</em>). He explained complex technical concepts in designer-friendly language. And he was instantly available. But his limitations became clear when context mattered most.</p><figure><img alt=""A set of three examples that have been made confidential and are drawn from the conversation the writer had with the synthetic developer."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UD3EPe2iiIGS5aBq3oDGsg.png"" /><figcaption>Due to confidentiality, I can’t share the exact details of my conversation with Tim.

At times, the responses felt more like “helpful AI assistant” than “Tim the developer”… Especially when offering solutions rather than asking clarifying questions. The persona worked best when I explicitly framed questions as developer-to-designer exchanges, but would drift toward generic helpfulness otherwise.</p><p>More critically, Tim occasionally hallucinated, most notably when he invented industry-specific project experience to justify his choices about the workflows (<em>example 3</em>). But the real issue wasn’t frequent fabrication; it was premature consensus. Tim would propose technically sound solutions without first questioning whether the underlying problem existed.</p><p>He was working from general developer knowledge, not our team’s knowledge.</p><h3>What real developers brought to the table</h3><p>The real developers brought something Tim couldn’t: <strong>skeptical curiosity</strong>. Where Tim would propose solutions, they’d ask “But have you checked with the client if they actually work this way?” Where Tim suggested optimization patterns, they’d question “Do we even have that problem yet?”</p><p>Users with multiple roles, need of in-app authentication for some features, further development of the product… They pointed out infrastructure context, security concerns, feasibility trade-offs, things Tim simply couldn’t know. They also brought institutional knowledge.</p><p>At times, they went too deep, drifting into implementation details that weren’t immediately relevant, but that richness was what anchored the project in reality.</p><p>The conversation didn’t end with answers. It led to relationship-building. We created a dedicated Slack channel for ongoing design-dev exchanges. The collaboration deepened beyond that single project.</p><h3>The real insight: synthetic as scaffolding, not structure</h3><p>What this test taught me about the nature of collaboration itself: AI can help us simulate collaboration, but not replace it.</p><p>Working with Tim showed me the potential of synthetic colleagues as preparation tools. They can:</p><ul><li>Help structure thinking before human discussions</li><li>Generate first-draft solutions to stress-test</li><li>Provide on-demand expertise when humans aren’t immediately available</li><li>Act as a rehearsal tool for complex conversations</li><li>Help us cover any angles we may have missed</li></ul><p>But they also:</p><ul><li>Miss context-specific constraints</li><li>Hallucinate with confidence</li><li>Can’t build relationships</li><li>Don’t challenge assumptions the way humans do</li><li>Lack the messiness that leads to breakthrough insights</li></ul><p>The real developers gave me more than expertise. They gave me relationship, institutional knowledge, and collaborative momentum that extended far beyond our initial conversation.</p><h3>How to use synthetic developers effectively</h3><p>It’s important to take into consideration that my observations are based on this one test, as I couldn’t replicate it with another LLM or for another project (yet).</p><p>Nonetheless, based on my experiment and broader research, here’s my recommendation: adopt a hybrid approach that leverages AI preparation while protecting human collaboration.</p><figure><img alt=""A schema with three blocks connected with arrows, showing a simplified version of the framework to use AI in briefs collaboration."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*14f33NCwtlixaaJYzEhftw.png"" /><figcaption>AI-assisted scoping requires expert validation. The hybrid approach gradually improves both AI outputs and team relationships. Credit: Anna Lefour.</figcaption></figure><h3>This framework has three interconnected phases:</h3><h4>Phase 1: preparation with AI</h4><p>Use synthetic developers as thinking partners to structure your approach before human discussions. The biggest limitation? They don’t know what they don’t know. Tim’s hallucinations mostly came from lack of context.</p><p>To make this phase effective:</p><ul><li>Document your project context exhaustively (industry, tech stack, existing architecture)</li><li>Ask a real developer to help you craft that context, they’ll know what details matter</li><li>Use AI to generate edge case scenarios, identify potential constraints, draft initial taxonomies</li><li>Formalize concepts you haven’t articulated clearly (in my experiment, Tim helped me structure Jobs To Be Done that became foundation for richer conversations later)</li></ul><p>Making AI useful requires human collaboration upfront. Treat AI outputs as conversation starters that help you ask better questions.</p><h4>Phase 2: e<strong>xpert validation</strong></h4><p>Always validate and enrich AI outputs with real humans. My test showed that Tim could provide useful initial framing, but the real developers brought context, nuance, and ideas no LLM could generate.</p><p>This isn’t about AI replacing 30 minutes of developer time. It’s about making those 30 minutes exponentially more valuable by arriving prepared with structured questions and preliminary solutions to stress-test.</p><p>Expert validation teaches you how to improve your synthetic colleague. What did the AI miss? What context mattered most? Use these insights to refine your prompts and evolve your persona. The goal isn’t perfection, it’s a framework that improves and adapts with each project.</p><h4>Phase 3: collaborative momentum</h4><p>Here’s the critical part: the ease of AI creates a dangerous temptation. When you can get “good enough” answers instantly, it’s easy to skip the messier, slower human conversation. Especially under deadline pressure.</p><p>That shortcut erodes exactly what makes collaboration valuable: relationship-building, institutional knowledge transfer, creative friction that leads to breakthrough insights.</p><p>Set a rule for yourself: If you use AI for preliminary exploration, commit to following up with humans. Even if AI “worked”.</p><p>The Slack channel that emerged from my real developer conversations became infrastructure for future collaboration and documentation of our progress and choices. No amount of synthetic dev efficiency could create that.</p><h3>Final thought</h3><p>Back to my main question: is a synthetic dev the solo designer’s best friend?</p><p>Well, not really. The designer’s best friends are still <strong>the colleagues who bring the expertise she or he lacks</strong>. But the synthetic dev can help bridge the gap: a facilitator to learn the developers’ language, a thinking partner to explore ideas. This experiment proved to me that synthetic actors (devs, users, PMs) aren’t about replacing, but about filling the gaps where communication or collaboration become harder.</p><p>Still,<strong> scaffolding isn’t a house</strong>. A synthetic dev isn’t a colleague.</p><p><strong>The goal was never to replace developers, but to explore how much of their reasoning AI can truly emulate.</strong> The future of design won’t be about choosing between humans and AI. It will be about weaving them together, making the most of what’s fast and scalable without losing what’s human and irreplaceable.</p><p>What about you? <strong>Do you use LLMs to extend your team’s skills or simulate an unavailable colleague?</strong></p><p><em>This article is part of my thesis research on AI’s impact on product team collaboration.

<h4><strong>The shift in product design with the advent of AI and a potential generative experiential future</strong></h4><blockquote>This short essay explores how core concepts in AI can reframe how product designers think about feedback, intent, and the future of our role.</blockquote><p>A lot has been written about the evolution of user experience since before I ever sat in a Barnes &amp; Noble for hours, trying to understand what the letters “H, C, and I” even meant. In the twelve years since that moment, the tools we use have matured, the rules for interaction have solidified, and the role of design has expanded. We have become a bridge connecting users, businesses, and the technologies that serve them.</p><p>Now, with artificial intelligence entering the public mainstream, a new question emerges: <em>where do we go from here?</em></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/767/1*l9X1bG4711j9SH6efndG5g.png"" /></figure><p>I am not here to push anyone toward <a href=""https://medium.com/@jacquelynyakira/thoughts-on-the-future-of-product-design-in-an-ai-first-world-621be208bfa5"">vibe coding</a>, <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/figma-make-the-biggest-shift-in-ux-ui-since-sketch-5483e18f76d7"">Figma Mak</a>e, or any particular path. Instead, I want to share an idea that came to me while learning the basics of how large language models work. It is a way to start connecting core concepts across domains and help product designers bridge toward the next era of technology. As we move beyond conversational interfaces, we will need new ways of thinking about how to interact with this emerging intelligence.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/451/1*4Psy0Mc7Nh5fyPS89nz9HA.png"" /></figure><p>At the top, I want to recognize that, for the purposes of this article, the term <em>product design</em> can mean many things. Even <a href=""https://www.figma.com/resource-library/what-is-product-design/"">Figma’s own definition</a> lists responsibilities that extend far beyond “pushing pixels.” Product designers excel when they have a deep understanding of how technology works and how the business measures success. Whether supporting key metrics or shaping strategy, our work brings together different domains.</p><p>To do that well, we already think in systems, frameworks, research, and telemetry to influence metrics and drive better outcomes. If we take that same mindset and apply it to concepts from AI such as <strong>training corpus, loss, gradients, and intent</strong>, we can start to see a future where design is not just about arranging interfaces but about understanding <em>how systems learn</em>. That is the bridge I want to explore.</p><h3><strong>What AI teaches us about feedback and learning</strong></h3><p>In almost every conversation about technology today, one word keeps surfacing: <em>data.</em> It shapes the experiences we design, the decisions businesses make, and the intelligence that powers modern systems. For this section, I want to focus on how data in AI can teach us something about our own design process, specifically how we learn and iterate.</p><figure><img alt=""Generic graph showing points as if plotted on an x- and y-axis."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/627/1*5IW-t0Tmhfn0pJTGytGu4w.png"" /><figcaption>Let’s pretend we have a bunch of data at our disposal.</figcaption></figure><p>In user experience, we often work with two types of data: qualitative, which describes what people say, and quantitative, which describes what they do or how often they do it. Let’s focus on the quantitative side for a moment. Imagine plotting the results of a usability study on a simple x and y axis, showing effort versus success rate. Now imagine doing something similar with the data an AI model learns from, what’s called its <strong><em>training corpus</em></strong><em> </em>(<a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/90916291/what-is-a-corpus-ai-corpora-chatgpt"">FastCompany’s article “What is a ‘corpus’”</a>)<em>.</em></p><figure><img alt=""Sample graphs, showing hypothetical data points along an x- and y-axis, one depicting sample usability data and the other training data for an LLM."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/823/1*YWP-fStx1-W9Jfr1rHGFWQ.png"" /><figcaption>Let’s imagine plotting our data, once for a usability study and another for our training data.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, an LLM’s data isn’t really this simple, but as a metaphor it helps. Once both sets of data are visualized, we can imagine drawing a line that represents our average user response on one chart and the AI’s predicted understanding on the other. The distance between those lines represents something that exists in both worlds: the gap between what we <em>expect</em> and what we <em>observe.</em></p><figure><img alt=""Hypothetical graphs with data points and an overlayed line on each showing average user response and the other illustrating an LLM’s prediction understanding from training data."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/823/1*NKc49UaujgiY5KKwqm2xOQ.png"" /><figcaption>Now let’s visualize what, as a green line, the average user response or an LLM’s prediction might look like.</figcaption></figure><p>In design, we call that <em>friction.</em> In AI, it’s called <strong><em>loss</em></strong><em>.</em> Both terms describe the cost of being wrong. When we iterate on a flow or redesign a feature to remove friction, we are, in a sense, minimizing loss. Each round of testing gives us more data to adjust our model of the user’s mental model, just as machine learning systems adjust their internal weights to better predict outcomes (<a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/loss-function"">IBM: What is Loss Function</a>).</p><figure><img alt=""Two graphs showing difference between average lines and data points, illustrating the connected concept(s) of user friction and loss."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/795/1*W-btC1pdHsjJgBsaIvK-nA.png"" /><figcaption>Difference between our predictions and reality impact our work exponentially irregardless if it is for an experience or an LLM we are creating.</figcaption></figure><p>Consider an onboarding flow where users repeatedly abandon a form at the “Company Name” field. Once identified, we might re-label the field or make it optional, reducing friction and improving completion rates. That adjustment mirrors how an AI system corrects its parameters after identifying an error.</p><figure><img alt=""Image illustrating data points towards desired average path to highlight how iteration and optimization are key for usability and LLM performance."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/333/1*XD_oG9iPScZzYRwO7Vjy7w.png"" /><figcaption>Tweaking an LLM’s parameters, or iterating on an experience, helps us optimize both.</figcaption></figure><p>This is where the concept of <strong><em>gradients</em></strong> comes in. In machine learning, a gradient measures the direction and magnitude of change needed to reduce loss. Think of it like rolling a ball down a landscape toward the lowest point (<a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/gradient-descent"">IBM: What is Gradient Descent?</a>). The slope tells the model how to adjust its parameters to improve performance. In product design, we do something similar every time we interpret usability data or customer feedback to decide what to change next. Our gradient is directional insight, the sense of where to move to make the experience smoother.</p><figure><img alt=""Graphic illustrating a curved line representing a downward slope, a gradient descent, with a data point at the bottom showing zero loss or friction."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/563/1*qHoM1I0rStyKAZN37XXCng.png"" /><figcaption>By tweaking parameters, of an LLM or an experience, we should see a reduction of friction and loss until they, ideally, disappear.</figcaption></figure><p>The iterative process that defines good design is, in many ways, a form of gradient descent. We identify where users struggle, adjust our assumptions, and measure again. Over time, our understanding converges toward what users need. It is not perfect, but neither are machine learning models; both are approximations refined through feedback.</p><p>If there’s one takeaway from this parallel, it’s that feedback, whether from people or from data, is not an afterthought. It’s the learning mechanism that keeps systems aligned with reality. And just as models can overfit to their training data, teams can overfit to internal assumptions or stakeholder preferences. In both cases, the cure is the same: structured, ongoing feedback loops that balance exploration with correction.</p><h3>Design as a system of optimization</h3><p>Now that we understand the shared language of feedback and learning between design and AI, it helps to zoom out and look at how these loops exist across every layer of our work. Most senior product designers already know that the interfaces we craft are only one piece of a much larger system. As noted in <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-maturity-model/"">Nielsen Norman’s levels of UX maturity</a>, mature groups and practitioners move beyond pixels to build frameworks, strategic models, and alignment structures. Even at these higher levels, tight loops of feedback and iteration guide what we do.</p><p>If learning and iteration exist at every level, our role is to understand how those levels connect. Each one has its own kind of <em>loss</em> to minimize and its own signals to optimize. We can roughly think of three layers at play:</p><ul><li><strong>Designers optimizing interfaces</strong>: reducing friction and improving micro-interactions (<em>micro Jobs to Be Done</em>).</li><li><strong>Interfaces optimizing user journeys</strong>: helping people complete the key <em>Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)</em> that deliver product value.</li><li><strong>Organizations optimizing outcomes</strong>: aligning those journeys to business metrics such as adoption, retention, and revenue.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Image illustrating three key levels in enterprise product design design and various focuses and example intents."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/582/1*u_7UvtufIi01PV66ZQC8RA.png"" /><figcaption>Product designers working strategically naturally optimize across three key layers in their work. Leveraging key signals across each level, alongside the goals (or intents), lets us understand the loss and how we can iterate to eliminate loss.</figcaption></figure><p>At the first level, designers focus on immediate signals like click rates or error events to reduce friction and guide users toward small but meaningful completions. At the next level, we expand our view to higher-order goals, such as “users complete their profile within thirty days.” These are composite outcomes that indicate whether our product fulfills its promises. Finally, at the organizational level, we zoom out again to see how entire journeys and feature sets contribute to larger KPIs and OKRs. Each level informs the others, forming a continuous loop of optimization from micro-interaction to business strategy.</p><figure><img alt=""Graphic illustrating simplified click-path and sample metrics across three optimization levels."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/964/1*sjffZcAXhKJXXoqAhS5v7g.png"" /><figcaption>Mapping optimization cycles in traditional experiential design, with accompanying signals, might look something like this.</figcaption></figure><p>As product designers, our work is shifting away from static interfaces and toward orchestrating these systems of <strong><em>intent</em></strong> which I mentally still hold in the same place as a JTBD. With the looming advent of more generative experiences, our influence lies less in deciding where each pixel goes and more in defining the <em>direction</em> a system should learn toward. Our task becomes identifying the goals for each layer, ensuring the feedback flowing through them is meaningful, and guiding the system to reduce its loss at every scale.</p><figure><img alt=""Simple graphic illustrating how a simple set of activities could change with inclusion of generative UI elements and their potential new signals for measurement."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/964/1*8sMLLbyQ0JBSwfxSUin98g.png"" /><figcaption>Signals become more about accuracy of identifying user needs (intent) and correlating actions an LLM takes towards supporting desired outcomes (such as delivering most impactful copy to encourage someone to purchase a product).</figcaption></figure><p>Doing that requires data and this is where many organizations struggle. In my experience at both small and large enterprise companies, few have mature instrumentation strategies that connect in-product signals to their KPIs or OKRs. The result is a blind spot: teams can’t see how user intent translates to business outcomes, especially in environments increasingly shaped by AI. When instrumentation is thoughtfully designed, those signals become the gradients we follow. They allow us to see where experiences fall short, measure how far off the mark they are, and iteratively align the product, the user, and the business.</p><p>Directionally similar to other schools of thought, such as from Claudia Canales’ <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/beyond-the-model-a-systems-approach-to-ai-product-design-fd9917750993"">Beyond the Model: a systems approach to AI product design</a>, positioning design as a system, I see it as one of optimization and not creating perfect screens. It’s about cultivating feedback systems that learn alongside users. When product designers learn to interpret intent, orchestrate signals, and balance the goals of each layer, we build the foundation for truly adaptive, AI-infused experiences.</p><h3>From control to guidance</h3><p>As product designers, many of us are used to controlling every element of the experience. But as generative systems begin composing parts of the interface for us, our value shifts from crafting the final form to defining the conditions that shape it. We move from being <em>the maker</em> to being <em>the guide</em> — designing how intent, data, and feedback interact to keep the system aligned with human goals.</p><p>Imagine opening your design tool and seeing a generative prototype already built around inferred intent. You don’t redraw components; you evaluate signals: <em>Did the model understand the job correctly? Did the feedback loop close?</em> That shift, from crafting to curating, is one direction our craft might be headed. Our influence doesn’t disappear; it evolves.</p><p>When we see design as a system of optimization, we stop treating AI as a separate discipline, or the latest tool to use, and start seeing it as a mirror. It reflects how we already work: learning, adjusting, and seeking balance between human intent and technical possibility. The next evolution of design isn’t about replacing what we do, but about scaling how we learn.</p><p>In the next article of this series, I’ll explore how instrumentation and <em>Jobs to Be Done</em> can serve as the connective tissue between intent and measurement — the practical levers we can use to steer generative systems toward meaningful outcomes.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=1d372707472d"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/from-design-to-direction-bridging-product-design-and-ai-thinking-1d372707472d"">From design to direction: Bridging product design and AI thinking</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

The final arrow labelled rebuild points up to the original screen."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zYZTPyhARpMMjBuUMMKo7A.jpeg"" /></figure><p>This article focuses on individuals who use products in English, despite their native language being different — those who reconstruct the context when perceiving information in English.</p><p>About 1.19 billion people use English as an additional language, <a href=""https://www.icls.edu/blog/most-spoken-languages-in-the-world"">compared with</a> 390 million native speakers — leaving 810 million non-native English users worldwide.</p><p>Since English content accounts for roughly <a href=""https://www.isocfoundation.org/2023/05/what-are-the-most-used-languages-on-the-internet/"">55% of all websites</a>, while only about 16 % of the world’s population speak English — including both native and non-native speakers — a large share of those users navigate the web in a language they learned later in life.</p><h3>What is context reconstruction and why it matters</h3><h4>How non-native English speakers perceive information</h4><p>When users interact with content in a non-native language, they don’t just read — they reconstruct. Context reconstruction is a three-step, non-linear loop where users decode unfamiliar words or syntax, translate them inwardly, then rebuild the intended meaning before deciding how to act. It’s not a passive process but an active, effortful one.</p><p><a href=""https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1214282.pdf"">Studies on second-language comprehension</a> show that readers use strategies like translation, paraphrasing, and contextual inference to reconstruct meaning. <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2226-471X/8/1/86"">Research on bilingual reading</a> confirms this process — users draw on background knowledge and context to bridge linguistic gaps.</p><p>In digital interfaces, <a href=""https://www.digitalstudies.org/article/id/9608"">this reconstruction extends beyond reading</a>: multilingual users interpret layout, structure, and tone through the same active meaning-making loop, as UX research on multilingual personas highlights.</p><p>When users process content in a second language, the reconstructive loop <a href=""https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/15502/1/A.E.Schweitzer%20PhD%20Thesis%20November%202016.pdf"">increases cognitive load</a>. Native speakers usually integrate syntax and meaning almost automatically. For non-native speakers, this integration slows down — the brain weighs <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022537179903554"">multiple interpretations before resolving the right one</a> — even when the surrounding context favours only one.</p><p>This pause — invisible but measurable — is where comprehension friction begins.</p><h4>How reconstruction principles apply to native speakers</h4><p>The cognitive load described in multilingual users isn’t unique to them. Similar friction appears for people with <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10036960/?utm"">lower literacy levels or certain cognitive disabilities</a>. Comprehension challenges like decoding, restructuring, and inferring meaning are shared <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Guides/Cognitive_accessibility?utm"">across many cognitive differences</a>. Design patterns that reduce this gap benefit everyone, not only international users — accessibility and language clarity go hand in hand.</p><p>The term ‘native speaker’ itself <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8517917/"">oversimplifies</a> how people use and learn languages. It combines factors like identity, exposure, and cultural background into a binary label that hides real proficiency differences and often reinforces bias. Instead of defining audiences by birth language, teams can describe them through language exposure and functional fluency.</p><p>Setting writing targets around those needs is more practical — for example, aiming for B1–B2 readability levels on the <a href=""https://readable.com/readability/readability-formulas/"">Flesch-Kincaid scale</a> supports broad comprehension across audiences.</p><p>Looking ahead, the line between native and non-native is already blurring. Trans-languaging — the natural mixing of languages — is common in global teams. UX copy isn’t just read by non-native speakers, it’s often <a href=""https://spotify.design/article/were-spilling-the-tea-spotify-ux-writing-questions-answered"">written by them</a>. Inclusive language isn’t just good UX — it’s sound <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/content-design-practices-for-sustainable-communication-in-tech-cbfc679be0cc"">workplace practice</a>.</p><h4>Business perspective on the topic</h4><p>For global products, English source copy should work like a blueprint — clear, structured, and easy to adapt. When it’s written in plain language, localisation teams can translate the meaning without losing intent. That clarity travels: it reduces rework, speeds up releases, and makes products easier to use in any language.</p><p>Plain content also saves money. Teams that act on clear copy often see fewer support requests and faster resolutions — <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.02737"">in some studies</a>, ticket volume dropped by up to 25 % after improving language clarity.</p><p>The same practices that make content easier to translate also make it <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10209-023-00986-z"">more accessible</a>. Structured, readable text reduces cognitive load for people with learning or attention differences — and helps non-native speakers too. Poor localisation <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1155/2022/6942735"">does the opposite</a>: it confuses users, adds cost, and quietly blocks conversions.</p><p>Language clarity isn’t just a UX win — it’s a business one. Aligned copy, culture, and layout turn communication into scale, making products more inclusive and more efficient at the same time — whether users are solving a problem, completing a task, or looking for quick answers inside a product.</p><h3>Designing for reconstruction</h3><h4>Quality benchmarks</h4><p>Making content reconstruction-ready takes small but deliberate shifts — across language, structure, process, and testing. The checklist below helps teams spot risks early and build toward equity at scale.</p><p><strong>Plain language: </strong><a href=""https://digital.gov/guides/plain-language"">Use plain verbs and avoid idiomatic phrasing</a>: ‘Create account’ or ‘Register’ instead of ‘Sign up’, ‘Start trial period’ rather than ‘Get started’. This reduces parsing complexity and helps meaning travel better across languages.</p><p><strong>Consistency:</strong> Collect key terms in a <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/product-glossary-simple-tool-for-consistent-content-960f8ea1b94f"">product glossary</a> and use them consistently. Avoid synonyms that fragment meaning — if you use ‘plan’ in one screen, don’t switch to ‘package’ or ‘bundle’ elsewhere. Consistency keeps terms stable across journeys and translations.</p><p><strong>Structure: </strong>Clear structure — one of content design’s core principles — <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1305134/full"">improves comprehension</a> for non-native readers and supports accessibility for all.</p><p>Start with information architecture: make navigation transparent and logical. Let users move back, pause, or finish a task midway. Use bullet lists to clarify choices and keep headings, buttons, and labels predictable. This saves time and makes content easy to scan and act on.</p><p>Good structure also supports fast problem-solving — users should find answers where they expect them, without scanning or guessing.</p><p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Plain, well-structured content also boosts accessibility.

Write source copy that can stand on its own, so meaning stays clear when removed from layout for translation. Even a short phrase like ‘Info updated’ can be misinterpreted — reflexive in one context, passive in another.

Ask them to pause and explain what they think a piece of copy means — you’ll quickly see where reconstruction fails.</p><p>Testing this way exposes issues that standard metrics often miss and helps build empathy across teams. Include tasks that mirror real support interactions — finding help, clarifying messages, or following troubleshooting steps — to reveal hidden friction.</p><h4>Reconstruction blocks</h4><p>When users reconstruct meaning, language and layout can either support or block that process. Even small mismatches can escalate into task failure. Beyond well-known localisation issues like <a href=""https://m2.material.io/design/usability/bidirectionality.html#mirroring-layout"">directionality</a> and <a href=""https://medium.com/@finnclark/designing-for-localisation-what-you-could-be-thinking-about-320184be10a9"">text expansion</a> there are recurring but less obvious tensions.</p><p>These patterns create friction in comprehension and task completion — addressing them early reduces errors, rework, and user frustration.</p><p><strong>Phrasal verbs: </strong>Phrases like ‘Sign up’ or ‘Sign in’ <a href=""https://riyajawandhiya.medium.com/figuring-out-when-to-use-sign-up-vs-register-vs-join-while-looking-at-principles-of-ux-writing-26d299f514dc"">often confuse users</a> — even native speakers. The difference feels small but delays action, especially when both appear on the same screen.</p><p>Use clear, literal verbs that describe the action. These forms translate more reliably and reduce hesitation. Test them with users to confirm comprehension.</p><p><strong>Idioms: </strong>Colloquial phrases like ‘Heads up’ or ‘Kick things off’ rely on cultural metaphors that don’t carry across languages. Replace them with phrasing that makes action explicit. Literal phrasing keeps intent clear and prevents cultural distortion.</p><p><strong>Cultural assumptions: </strong>Error messages like ‘Oops, something went wrong’ may sound casual in English but dismissive elsewhere. In languages with layered politeness, such as Korean or Japanese, <a href=""https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=5350&amp;context=lkcsb_research#:~:text=Abstract%20A%20very%20prominent%20feature,and%20directions%20for%20future%20research"">tone directly shapes trust</a>.</p><p>Write clear, neutral guidance instead — ‘We couldn’t load your details. Please refresh or try again’. Matching tone to user expectations builds reliability and respect.</p><p><strong>Gendered grammar: </strong>English verbs are neutral, but many languages inflect for gender. In Spanish or French, mismatched gender agreement <a href=""https://linguistics.washington.edu/sites/linguistics/files/documents/research/language_learning.pdf"">slows reading</a> and can sound awkward. Translators often have to choose gendered forms even when the English source is neutral.</p><p>Avoid phrasing that forces this choice — use ‘Confirm’ instead of ‘I agreed’ or ‘I’m ready’. Check how target languages express gender early in localisation to keep translations inclusive.</p><p><strong>Auto-generated alt-text and captions: </strong>Machine-generated captions and alt-text <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9395872/"">often miss nuance or context</a>. When captions run faster than about <a href=""https://dcmp.org/learn/601-captioning-key---presentation-rate"">160 words per minute</a>, comprehension drops sharply.</p><p>Review all accessibility copy manually for clarity, neutrality, and pacing. Treat it as part of the user experience, not metadata.</p><p><strong>Split attention: </strong>When instructions appear far from the fields they describe — for example, password rules above an input box — users must hold information in working memory. That extra effort <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12366468/"">increases cognitive load</a>.</p><p>Keep related information close together in both layout and flow. Memory should not have to carry UX.</p><p><strong>Choice overload: </strong>Too many visible options overwhelm users, especially non-native speakers. Studies show that greater menu complexity increases <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357695637_An_Analysis_on_the_Impact_of_Choice_Overload_to_Consumer_Decision_Paralysis"">decision paralysis</a>, while simplified layouts improve task speed by about <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01292"">25 percent</a>.</p><p>Apply <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/progressive-disclosure?srsltid=AfmBOooR-h3xZ1WJIY52UypnK4QcAYctQ_n6DXzch7p3qOg1Ya6RZB-Q"">progressive disclosure</a> and group related items logically. Fewer, clearer decisions reduce drop-offs and support comprehension.</p><p>Reconstruction fails when copy or layout forces users to infer too much. To avoid this, designers must go beyond surface fixes and invest in understanding how language and culture shape perception.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/how-does-knowledge-of-other-languages-impact-your-perspective-as-a-ux-designer-1ecb6bf99690"">Language and design are inseparable</a>: learning how different languages structure thought and communication broadens a designer’s perspective and leads to more inclusive solutions.

But UX should never be reduced to just trendy visuals, and it would be a mistake to see M3E as simply a refresh to MD’s aesthetic sensibilities.</p><p>M3E is at its core speaking to the problems that a large plurality of users, particularly older age groups, have experienced to varying degrees with the dominant UI design paradigm of the last decade or so — ‘flat’ UI design. These overly-simplified designs showed a lack of <strong>clear interaction signifiers</strong>, leading to <strong>click uncertainty</strong>, and <strong>barriers to quick scanning</strong>.</p><p>Digging into the guidelines, the research, and the changes Google has pushed thus far, it’s clear that M3E represents the MD team’s attempt to address these limitations of flat UI design, applying the conclusions of UX researchers over the years, now supported by Google’s own usability studies.</p><figure><img alt=""A collection of 10 phone screen mockups on a pastel purple background, showing various concept designs that showcase the standout aesthetic features of Material 3 Expressive: experimentation with varied button sizes, lots of colour, and bohemian font choices"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QzkU3a_Pelfur_EvQnjNrQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Some promo material for Google’s M3E update.

From perhaps the earliest days of consumer computing, UIs relied on a set of principles known as <strong>skeuomorphism</strong> — taking physical cues from the real-world, like shadows, depth, and imagery, to communicate the functionality of an interface.</p><p>This methodology is today most fondly remembered from Apple’s early iOS apps, especially the ones which took skeuomorphism to an almost pantomime degree by imitating the functionality and look of real, traditional objects or devices. A notebook became a notes app with a yellow paper background and ruled margins; a newsagents’ cabinet carried over into the newsstand app, with digitally articulated oak wood-texture shelves.</p><p>Skeuomorphism was essentially a very complex set of <strong>signifiers</strong> — <a href=""https://jnd.org/signifiers-not-affordances/"">cues that an object uses to communicate how to use it</a> — which communicated functionality to the user by relying on our real-world knowledge. Eventually, once interaction paradigms became <a href=""https://jnd.org/affordances-and-design/"">cultural convention</a>, skeuomorphic flourishes became visual flair and noise, distracting as it was no longer necessary to teach functionality by relating the real to the digital.</p><h4>Flat design</h4><p>By 2014, digital interfaces no longer seemed constrained by the users’ presumed greater familiarity with the physical world. Cue <strong>flat design</strong>. Windows 8 went full brutalist minimalism; iOS 7 stripped away all the Steve Jobs gloss; and Android Lollipop brought Material Design to the party. Material was always a little different, basing itself off a series of stacked-paper metaphors which included a healthy dose of drop shadows (<a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/flat-design/"">NN/g called it ‘Flat 2.0’</a>), but it was still, at its core, a flat approach.</p><figure><img alt=""A side-by-side comparison of two versions of the iPhone calendar app"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xHNivWuKzFhnGfhAzU_5VQ.png"" /><figcaption>When Apple adopted flat design: the calendar app’s skeuomorphic look in iOS 6 (left) vs. iOS 7 (right). (Moss, 2013)</figcaption></figure><p>Flat design’s philosophy, in the great modernist tradition, was exceedingly simple: <strong>remove everything that’s not needed</strong>.</p><p>Retreating from the overtly heavy visual ornamentation that skeuomorphism had become infamous for was a step in the right direction. But along with the trend toward simplification, researchers found that many flat design implementations also harboured a worrying tendency to go to far, to <strong>oversimplify</strong>, leaning too hard on assumptions of user familiarity with common layouts. In the name of minimalism, these flat UIs stripped away too many visual cues, leaving interactable elements without signifiers and creating interfaces that produced hesitation rather than harmony.</p><p>In the name of minimalism, these flat UIs stripped away too many visual cues, leaving interactable elements without signifiers and creating interfaces which produced hesitation rather than harmony</p><p>Ever since flat design emerged researchers, particularly those at the Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g), have been hard at work studying these usability challenges. In the interests of time and space, mine and yours, a short guide to some of the best research is presented below, although I recommend you take the time to read each article for yourself.</p><h3>Flat design &amp; click uncertainty: The 22 percent problem</h3><p>In 2017, Kate Moran and the NN/g team ran an extensive eyetracking study into the then-emerging flat design. They presented 71 users with 9 different pairs of website designs: one with strong visual signifiers (colour, shading, and/or depth); and one with weak or non-existent signifiers (utilising reduced contrast and/or containment). Participants were presented with simple real-world tasks, such as “<em>You will see a page from a hotel website. Reserve this hotel room.</em>”</p><figure><img alt=""Side-by-side closeup of two different text treatments"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CP4f35b11kmr2tzYZWr0Dg.png"" /><figcaption>A closeup of a jewellery website target link tested by NN/g, strong-signifier (left) and weak-signifier (right) versions. (Moran, 2017a)</figcaption></figure><p>The results were revealed in one <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-criticisms-flat-design/"">much-discussed</a> article, ‘<a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/flat-ui-less-attention-cause-uncertainty/"">Flat UI Elements Attract Less Attention and Cause Uncertainty</a>’, from which two damning statistics emerge:</p><ul><li>Users spent<strong> 22 percent more time completing tasks</strong> on pages with weak signifiers.</li><li>They also had <strong>25 percent more page fixations</strong> on the weak-signifier pages, i.e. their eyes spent more time scanning the page before they found what they needed.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Side-by-side comparison of heatmaps"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RcCFcwUXVrnLjXhkPCGpNA.png"" /><figcaption>The heatmap of the jewellery website pair shows stronger fixations on the strong-signifier interface (left) versus the weak-signifier version (right). The user task was to find the pearl jewellery. (Moran, 2017a)</figcaption></figure><p>I should note here that the NN/g study was not embarking on a tirade against the whole of flat design. However, the core tenet of flat design is <strong>simplification</strong> of an interface, and the point of the study was to discover how the extent to which this principle is applied affects usability. Many flattened interfaces suffer from these exact pitfalls, and the stimuli pairs that Moran et al. tested were in fact sourced from real website pages.</p><p>(Just the other day I actually ran into an e-commerce website which shared the same button styling, or lack thereof, as in the weak-signifier version of the jewellery website above — evidently the study’s lessons remain relevant to this very day)</p><h4>Click certainty vs. uncertainty</h4><p>NN/g’s heatmaps revealed what Moran labelled “click uncertainty.” On the strong-signifier pages, user attention was more often than not far more focused and confident on than on the flat pages. Because the flat versions of each page had stripped away certain cues that users rely on to differentiate what’s clickable and what’s not, they had to spend more time scanning the page, expending more cognitive load to locate the UI element which would complete the task given to them.</p><p>It’s the opposite of what good UX aims for. To quote Moran:</p><blockquote><em>“</em>We want our users to have experiences that are easy, seamless, and enjoyable. Users need to be able to look at a page, and understand their options immediately. They need to be able to glance at what they’re looking for and know instantly, ‘Yep, that’s it.’<em>”</em></blockquote><p>But although it was a significant, extensive piece of research, Moran’s study was not the first — and would not be the last — to sound the alarm on the potential pitfalls of flat design.</p><h3>Further UX research</h3><p>One of the earliest studies addressing the usability drawbacks of flat UI designs focused on an early progenitor of the trend: Windows 8. NN/g’s ‘<a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/windows-8-disappointing-usability/"">Windows 8 — Disappointing Usability for Both Novice and Power Users</a>’ (2012) strongly rejected the overtly flat changes Windows 8 had touted: poorly signposted buttons, hardly distinguishable from text labels or info cards, and icons that were “<em>flat, monochromatic, and coarsely simplified,</em>” falling into the background of the overall information architecture.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of a dark-blue settings menu with a 3x3 grid of white menu link buttons"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/344/1*vmQRRzsnFVoXEXYOb37ylQ.png"" /><figcaption>A disturbingly flat settings menu in Windows 8. (Nielsen, 2012)</figcaption></figure><p>And similar conclusions to the Windows 8 article were noted in two other studies in 2015:</p><p><strong>Lücken et al.</strong> published ‘<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110443929-039"">Evaluation of buttons in the context of the Flat Design style</a>,’ which found that stripping away strong visual affordances from a button exponentially raises user hesitation time, and decreases the chance it actually gets clicked.</p><p>In <strong>Burmistrov et al.</strong>’s ‘<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-22668-2_10"">Flat Design vs Traditional Design</a>,’ the task of identifying clickable objects created a higher cognitive load and rate of error in flat website designs than in ‘traditional’ site designs. Scanning in a grid of flat icons also took twice as long as scanning in a grid of skeuomorphic ones.</p><p>Stripping away strong visual affordances from a button exponentially raises user hesitation time, and decreases the chance it actually gets clicked.</p><p>An NN/g study from 2015, ‘<a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/flat-design-long-exposure/"">Long-Term Exposure to Flat Design: How the Trend Slowly Decreases User Efficiency</a>,’ was one of the earliest to note that young adult users were more effective at identifying clickable elements in flat interfaces, while also pointing out that flat design had trained users to spend more time hesitating before clicking. But despite younger users’ superior performance with flat UIs, the study noted that “<strong><em>young adult users don’t enjoy click uncertainty </em></strong><em>any more than other user groups</em>.”</p><p>More recently, in 2022’s ‘<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2020.1814867"">From skeuomorphism to flat design</a>,’ <strong>Urbano et al.</strong> delineated and tested three interface design styles: flat, skeuomorphic, and ‘skeuominimalist’. The researchers created mockups reflecting the differences between the three styles, incorporating their approaches to colour and shading, adding varying degrees of visual signifiers for interactable elements. Their findings revealed that purely flat designs significantly increase click error rates across <em>all</em> age groups, and <strong>for older users, task completion time was notably sabotaged</strong>.</p><p>One common thread runs through the research: flat design’s tendency to strip away visual signifiers from interfaces inevitably impairs usability. It made interfaces harder to use, especially for older users. Rather than focusing user attention on what matters, making UIs <strong>too clean</strong>, <strong>too white</strong>, <strong>too flat</strong> has the opposite effect: users can lose the ability to discern what they should be paying attention to at all, generating click hesitation and increasing scanning time.</p><p>While our humble UX researchers have been studying these issues for many years, not many companies have actually noticed and followed suit — but with M3E, Google has bucked the trend.</p><h3>From flat design to Material 3 Expressive</h3><p>The example below is a screenshot from <a href=""https://m3.material.io/blog/building-with-m3-expressive"">one of Google’s new M3E guideline articles</a>, and it perfectly demonstrates how Google has brought the weight of UX research to bear on their design philosophy:</p><figure><img alt=""A side-by-side comparison showing two versions of a financial app home screen"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JfALVeLBXkvIRgLVss7BOw.png"" /><figcaption>Do’s and don’t’s from Google’s new guidelines.

But since June of this year, Google has begun rolling out design refreshes to their roster of apps, implementing changes that take cues from the new Expressive guidelines:</p><figure><img alt=""A side-by-side comparison showing two versions of the Gmail email app inbox screen"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8snae9amX10NThLf8tBn3A.png"" /><figcaption>The Gmail inbox, before (left) and after (right) M3E.

(Li, 2025)</figcaption></figure><p>Again, <strong>containment </strong>(each settings link and each email get their own containers), <strong>common region </strong>(related settings and emails list explicitly grouped) and <strong>stronger colours </strong>(see the M3E Gmail’s compose button) are all strategically implemented, adding important signifiers to critical interactions, and creating immediately clear structure.</p><p>We were lucky enough to get a large amount of the research behind these changes published by Google. And it’s clear from their findings that these changes were aimed at solving the problems with flat design that we’ve seen in the research so far — lack of clear signifiers leading to click uncertainty and barriers to scanning.</p><h3>Google’s research findings</h3><p>In the snappy article which explained the research behind the update, ‘<a href=""https://design.google/library/expressive-material-design-google-research"">Better, Easier, Emotional UX</a>,’ the MD design team waxed lyrical about the origins of M3E:</p><blockquote><em>“</em>Back in 2022, our research intern was studying user sentiment toward Material Design in Google apps. After mentioning her initial findings to colleagues in a Munich beer hall, she sparked a team-wide design debate: Why did all these apps look so similar? So boring? Wasn’t there room to dial up the <em>feeling</em>?<em>”</em></blockquote><figure><img alt=""A collection of 9 phone screen mockups on a pastel purple background, showing various concept designs that showcase the standout aesthetic features of Material 3 Expressive: experimentation with varied button sizes, lots of colour, and bohemian font choices"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uyMRWpPABImhPv35gGbyuQ.png"" /><figcaption>Dial up the FEELING! (<em>Start building</em>, 2025)</figcaption></figure><p>The results of this debate speak for themselves. Instead of just redesigning based on designerly intuition, Google embarked on a massive three-year-long, 18,000 participant-strong research study, testing hundreds of design variations across 46 different research studies and conducting surveys and focus groups to gather emotional responses.</p><p>Material 3 Expressive was the result, and Google’s findings validate everything that UX researchers have been pointing out about flat design for years: click uncertainty, barriers to scanning, and age gaps.</p><h4>4x faster discovery</h4><p>Using the latest eye-tracking equipment to analyse where users attention was focused, Google had participants interact with 10 different apps pairs: one in current M3 style, and a new M3E version.</p><p>One example was that of an email app: where the current M3 Gmail design relied on whitespace alone to contain the key action (sending the email), hiding it in the top app bar next to other secondary buttons, the M3 Expressive design heightened the visual signifiers, making the primary interaction a large, explicitly contained and contrasted button, placed just above the keyboard.</p><p>Users discovered the send button <strong>four times faster</strong> in the Expressive redesign.</p><figure><img alt=""A side-by-side comparison showing two versions of an email drafting screen"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dVScxiHpXmmBY9qok8LKTA.png"" /><figcaption>Two versions of a concept email app Google used in its testing. (<em>Better, Easier</em>, 2025)</figcaption></figure><p>That’s a significant improvement, and it demonstrates just how much more of an additional cognitive load was added by the flatter information architecture and reduced visual signifiers that flat design boasted. The benefits also extended beyond fixation time: across all the Expressive design apps tested, the time users took to tap on the key action actually <strong>decreased by seconds</strong>.</p><p>The key takeaway isn’t only that Google’s M3E designs are better, but that the research was right: flattening an interface too much results in decreased ease of scanning, and hesitancy about where to click.</p><h4>Age gaps flattened</h4><p>As we’ve seen, digital products usually exhibit a measurable performance difference between younger and older users. Older age groups take longer to identify key UI elements, while <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/flat-design-long-exposure/"">younger users can often pick up on subtle design cues</a> which allow them to identify key actions much faster.</p><p>So perhaps the most important finding from Google’s research is that their Expressive design tactics have resulted in a dramatic <strong>erasure of this gap in performance</strong>:</p><figure><img alt=""Line graph showing that UI elements were spotted faster (in seconds) in expressive designs across all age groups"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BIhWwgmrSZaIy_RXziyExA.png"" /><figcaption>Chart of M3 vs M3E fixation times per age group.

They aren’t bringing back wood panelling, glass sheen or yellow note paper textures — they’re bringing back <strong>functional signifiers</strong>, the visual cues that help users identify interactive elements and allow them to understand the information architecture at a glance. M3E is a data-driven correction to the problems of flat design that researchers have noted for more than a decade.</p><p>Mind you, the update isn’t perfect. The two new wavy progress indicators, while a lovely idea, do look a bit like a shuffling worm and a wobbly intestinal tract. You be the judge:</p><figure><img alt=""Animation of linear and circular purple progress indicators showing determinate progress and indeterminate progress"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZiKNgUuDmjx51fRYhCkxLw.gif"" /><figcaption>M3E’s new earthworm &amp; human intestine indicators. (<em>Progress indicators</em>, 2025)</figcaption></figure><p>It’s probably not a coincidence that M3 Expressive comes at a time when it seems like the whole world is retreating from minimalism: style, buildings, design everywhere, just look around! Vogue Australia’s <a href=""https://www.vogue.com.au/vogue-living/design/decor-trends-2025/image-gallery/8a0c4e8a1db9042a17cd6a8eec7e9112"">guide to 2025’s interior design trends</a> even reads like it could be a pitch for M3E — ‘<em>express yourself</em>,’ ‘<em>bolder is better</em>,’ ‘<em>the return of colour</em>.’</p><p>This is the line us UX designers must tread. Trends, to a certain extent, allow us to identify what users are familiar with, what they might find the most ‘modern’ or appealing.</p><p>But an app isn’t a house. It’s a 2D tool, projected on a crystalline display, that solves a problem for a user, and I would argue the aesthetic choices of our 2D tools may have far more of a knock-on effect on usability scores than aesthetic interior design choices do. Perhaps it’s because we interact with our apps with the minutia of fingers and eyes alone, rather than the full-body experience of a house. Or perhaps it’s just discipline tunnel vision.</p><p>The research — from NN/g’s heatmaps to Google’s 18,000-person studies — has definitively shown that blindly following popular trends (i.e. flat design) without studying the utility impact can do far more harm than good.</p><p>As designers, we should never have let ourselves be satisfied with the assumption that, since many users have become familiar with general interface patterns, we can afford to go totally minimalist in our approach to content, layout and signifiers. Conventions are a powerful and necessary tool, and designers should always aim to leverage a users’ existing knowledge. But there are limits to every law. UI design, particularly for products used by a broad range of ages like Android, should be able to articulate itself for every user, offering <strong>clarity of function</strong> as well as simple form.</p><p>Rather than let their design guidelines enter a phase of <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/liquid-glass/"">rampant design cacophony</a>, Google have chosen to build on the years of usability research accumulated since flat design’s inception. It’s an incredibly encouraging development.</p><p>On one last point — although this article is primarily about the research trail from the earliest flat design studies to M3E — it would be remiss of me not to note M3E’s exciting new aesthetic possibilities. In a culture when users are becoming increasingly bored with minimalist trends, interfaces injected with additional artistic intent and emotional appeal have the potential to stand out from the bland, unexciting competition.</p><p>The keywords of M3 Expressive — delight, joy, playfulness, modernity — are exciting for designers and users alike, but these touches must be applied with intent, skill and strategy, always testing with that age-old question, so often lost in translation: ‘<em>does this improve the end user experience?</em>’</p><h3>Sources</h3><p><em>Better, Easier, Emotional UX</em>.

<h4>The illusion of intelligence is the new frontier of deception.</h4><figure><img alt=""Animated character with pale skin, scraggly black hair, and an eerie expression. Wears a distorted Superman logo on a purple suit. Dark, vibrant background."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UD88HUJXrf-IcJHasqUqNg.png"" /><figcaption>Image source: <a href=""https://dcau.fandom.com/wiki/Bizarro"">dcau.fandom.com/wiki/Bizarro</a></figcaption></figure><p>I was a huge Superman fan as a kid. In fact, my first tattoo was of the Superman symbol — I know, cheesy. But there was something about that idea of strength guided by purpose that stuck with me. However, one character that truly captured my imagination was Superman’s failed copy — <a href=""https://dcau.fandom.com/wiki/Bizarro"">Bizarro</a>.</p><p>Bizarro is a botched experiment by the genius villain <a href=""https://superman.fandom.com/wiki/Lex_Luthor"">Lex Luthor</a> to replicate Superman. He sort of looks like the hero we know, has his powers, and even tries to do good — but everything he does comes out wrong. He saves people by endangering them, speaks in twisted opposites, and mistakes harm for help. He isn’t evil — just reversed. That inversion — an imitation of greatness that misunderstands its essence — is a fitting metaphor for modern AI.</p><p>But this metaphor isn’t just poetic—Apple’s 2025 paper <a href=""https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking""><em>The Illusion of Thinking</em></a> backs it up. In the study, Apple researchers tested a class of models they called “Large Reasoning Models,” essentially Large Language Models (LLMs) retuned for reasoning, using puzzles like the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi"">Tower of Hanoi</a>. At first the models performed well, but as the puzzles grew more complex, their reasoning began to fail.</p><p>Instead of increasing their effort, the models produced shorter and less coherent thought chains, often stopping even when more computation time was available. The researchers observed that their reasoning degraded, revealing that the systems were matching patterns that appeared like reasoning rather than genuinely reasoning.</p><p>As complexity increased, their logic collapsed into pure prediction. The models recognized the shape of thought without ever truly thinking. The result sounded intelligent but felt hollow.</p><p>At the end of the day, these “intelligent” machines are little more than glorified autocorrect systems — predicting, not thinking. That’s dangerous, because it blurs the line between intelligence and imitation.</p><p>It’s a false illusion sold by powerful tech companies as they rake in billions. If I didn’t know better, I’d call the entire <a href=""https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/ai-schemes-could-make-bernie-madoffs-fraud-look-trivial-eugene-soltes"">AI movement a modern Ponzi scheme</a> — but that’s a discussion for another day.</p><p>Anyone who’s used tools like ChatGPT knows the frustration of arguing with a machine that doesn’t know it’s wrong. And yes, I say “arguing” because I often catch myself yelling (with colorful language) at these conversational AI tools — a fact I’m not proud of.</p><p>I know it’s foolish to yell at a machine, but in my defense, maybe it should act more like a machine instead of a compulsive liar.</p><p>Just the other day, I asked it to debug a JavaScript snippet it had written. When I said it wasn’t working, it replied, “You’re absolutely correct! The code appears to be flaky.” Code it had just given me. I was actually more surprised by the use of the word flakey than the fact that it gave me broken code.</p><p>That moment perfectly captured the essence of modern AI — confident errors, fluent nonsense, and zero accountability. This is where we’ve landed as a society. We’ve traded honesty for efficiency.</p><p>To understand why a model would confidently call its own code “flaky,” we need to look at how we have historically defined intelligence in machines, and how that definition has shifted.</p><p>The earliest approach in AI, <a href=""https://bdtechtalks.com/2019/11/18/what-is-symbolic-artificial-intelligence/"">symbolic intelligence</a>, encoded human-knowledge in explicit rules and logic. It relied on structured reasoning — if-then statements, symbol hierarchies, and clear inference paths. The advantage—every conclusion is transparent and traceable.</p><p>But the disadvantage—when faced with messy, real-world inputs (such as image recognition or natural language), the rule-based system struggles to scale or cope with ambiguity.</p><p>Following the limitations of rule-based symbolic methods, the field shifted to <a href=""https://www.aaas.org/taxonomy/term/9/heuristic-and-statistical-artificial-intelligence"">statistical artificial intelligence</a>. Instead of encoding explicit logic, this approach relies on probability, large datasets and pattern recognition.</p><p>The system doesn’t “reason” in human terms — it correlates. It learns statistical relationships between inputs and outcomes, then uses those to predict. The trade-off—high scalability and flexibility, but weak transparency and little genuine “understanding.”</p><p>And then there’s today’s g<a href=""https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI"">enerative artificial intelligence</a> — the kind behind text, images, and music. Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are trained on massive datasets scraped from the internet, learning statistical patterns across billions of examples.</p><p>LLMs use <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/transformer-model"">transformer networks</a> to learn contextual relationships by predicting the next word across billions of parameters, creating language that feels coherent but remains purely probabilistic.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/diffusion-models"">diffusion models</a> generate images by gradually denoising random noise into structured visuals, guided by patterns learned from vast datasets.</p><p>Both systems learn correlations, not concepts — they model likelihoods, not meaning.</p><p>The trajectory is clear — the further we’ve moved from the transparency of logic (symbolic AI) toward the fluency of prediction (generative AI), the more convincingly human the output appears — and the more fundamentally alien the process behind it becomes.</p><p>This is the paradox of modern AI. In our quest to build reliable intelligence, we created its flawed reflection — a brilliant mimic whose fluency guarantees imitation, but whose lack of reasoning prevents the very understanding and accountability we need to trust it.</p><p>But maybe it’s not entirely bad. Generative AI feeds on what already exists, which means originality still belongs to us. That gives creators a chance to stand apart — to make what the machine can only imitate.</p><p>The more I learn about AI, the less I fear it taking our jobs — and the more I fear its power to distort truth. These systems don’t think—they replicate. They strip away context until meaning becomes optional.</p><p>In that sense, Big Tech has become our Lex Luthor — brilliant, self-assured, and convinced it’s saving humanity while quietly trying to own it. Its creations mirror its ambition—powerful, profitable, and fundamentally indifferent to the truth.</p><p>That’s the real danger — not that AI will outthink us, but that it will outproduce us, flooding the world with fluent illusions that sound right but aren’t. It’s our own version of Bizarro — except this time, there’s no Superman coming to save us.</p><p><strong><em>Don’t miss out! </em></strong><a href=""https://micbuckcreative.medium.com/subscribe""><strong><em>Join my email list</em></strong></a><strong><em> and receive the latest content.</em></strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ce6d4ba04f64"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/we-wanted-superman-level-ai-instead-we-got-bizarro-ce6d4ba04f64"">We wanted Superman-level AI.

<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/book-to-tv-movies-adaptations-2025"">newest adaptation</a> of Mary Shelley’s timeless novel <em>Frankenstein</em> has captivated audiences, with director Guillermo del Toro’s film being praised for being mostly faithful to the source material. Starring Australia’s own Jacob Elordi as The Creature and Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein, somehow it’s Mia Goth, as Elizabeth Lavenza, who steals the show — adorned by Tiffany &amp; Co. jewels and 19th Century gowns. Her extensive wardrobe for <em>Frankenstein</em> came from the mind of Emmy Award-nominated <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/materialists-dakota-johnson-outfits-costumes"">costume designer</a> Kate Hawley, who has worked on projects such as <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</em> and <em>Crimson Peak</em>. Goth’s character Elizabeth has an interest in entomology and botany, so Hawley included nods to beetles and other insects through patterns and garment shapes. Along with wasp-waisted <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/how-to-style-corsets"">tight corsets</a>, certain fabrics were also chosen to mimic paper-thin beetle wings.</p>



<p>“With the green dress… that design was inspired by butterflies, and the patterns on butterfly wings,” Goth tells <em>Refinery29 Australia</em>. “[This] was something that Guillermo and Kate were exploring a lot with Elizabeth and [with] all of the costumes, everything was thought through.” To create unique insect-like patterns, Hawley studied both cellular structures and the anatomy of beetles. “It’s all about echoing those insect and beetle-like qualities, just fitted to the period,” Hawley says in the production notes.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941847.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=682&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A341"" /></figure>



<p>Jewellery was also key to defining Goth’s character, with her blue outfit featuring a Tiffany &amp; Co. signature piece from the early 1900s. The Louis Comfort Tiffany necklace is made up of blue glass beetle motifs in a gold setting. “We wanted to pull pieces that were from the age of Mary Shelley so that you could study the choices our designers were making at that time,” Christopher Young, Vice President and Creative Director of Tiffany Patrimony and Global Creative Visual Merchandising, said in a <a href=""https://www.tiffany.com/world-of-tiffany/collaborations/netflix-frankenstein.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">press video</a>. The result is what jewellers describe as blurring the line “between jewellery and art”.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941846.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=682&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A341"" /></figure>



<p>One of Elizabeth’s most striking dresses is her final look, a white dress where white satin ribbons wrap around her arms. Made to resemble surgical bandages, it pays homage to both Elizabeth’s fate and The Creature’s origin. “That was deliberate,” Goth says. “That was there to mimic The Creature and his band aids that he has when he’s first born.” This white dress also features multiple layers of fabric that capture the light in an interesting way, a design element thought through by both the costume designer and director. “Guillermo wanted Elizabeth to be very ethereal, and there’s an iridescence and ephemeral nature to some of those colours and fabrics that helped us [portray this],” Hawley notes.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941845.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=682&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A341"" /></figure>



<p>There’s also a religious nod in many of Elizabeth’s outfits, particularly seen through the use of bonnets. “Religious language is a big part of Elizabeth’s character, and that bonnet is like a halo,” Hawley explains. “Mia has such an amazing, mercurial face  — one of the first fittings we had, we put that bonnet on her, and we put the yellow veil over her, and she just became this other creature.” While Goth jokingly tells <em>R29 </em>she couldn’t breathe in her restrictive wardrobe, stepping into the period pieces helped frame her performance as Elizabeth. “That was helpful, because that’s exactly how a woman in the Victorian world would feel, and it formed how I moved and how I sat,” Goth says. “I felt once I started to see where the costumes were headed, I found my character, Elizabeth, kind of from the outside in this time around. </p>



<p>“So, [by] seeing what they were doing with her on the outside, I was then able to kind of figure out what was going on in the inside.” </p>

Uruguayan sisters Lucía and Florencia Ottonello founded their <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/pastiche_sisterproject/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">slow-fashion brand Pastiche</a> in Montevideo in 2016. Nine years later, the brand’s cozy knits, structured denim, and breezy linen pieces are now available in the U.S. Last week, <a href=""https://pastichesisterproject.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pastiche launched its U.S. website</a>, making its playful, ethically made designs accessible to new shoppers. And with a collection of warm textures and artful silhouettes, the expansion comes just in time for our fall and winter seasons.<br /><br />“We’re vintage-inspired but still modern. We are most interested in classic looks,” Florencia told Refinery29 Somos of Pastiche's designs. “You’ll want to keep our pieces and pass them down. They’re not items to be discarded.” <br /><br />Pastiche’s commitment to slow, ethical production means every item is designed and crafted in Uruguay, often working with Uruguayan, Argentine, and Brazilian suppliers as well as local artisans. This approach not only preserves South American techniques and styles, but it also ensures fair wages, sustainable practices, and clothing that’s built to last — all increasingly meaningful choices for conscious consumers.<br /><br />“We’re just looking forward to growing thoughtfully. We don't need stores everywhere, we just want to make clothes that people feel good in, pay our folks well, and spend time with our families,” Florencia said.<br /><br />To celebrate the launch, we selected some of our favorite Pastiche pieces that are perfect for the cooler months, so that you can layer responsibly, mix textures, and invest in timeless, versatile pieces that will carry you through many more falls and winters.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

Oh, and this caramel, beige, and black color palette makes me feel like I'm heading into a snowy mountain lodge (even if I'm actually just on a stroll in the Florida wetlands).<br /><br /><strong>Pastiche</strong> Pastiche’s Aspen Parka Coat, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpastichesisterproject.com%2Fproducts%2Faspen-parka-coat-caramel"">Pastiche</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1564"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11942230.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1166&amp;height=1564&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=583:782"" width=""1166"" /><figcaption>Ready for a cutie loafer moment?

<p>Yet another <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/old-navy-anna-sui-collaboration-2025"">cool-girl fashion collaboration</a> has entered the chat. This time, model Alexa Chung is celebrating her <a href=""https://www.madewell.com/feature/alexa-chung-collection/"">long-standing relationship with Madewell</a> — 15 years after their first collaboration — with a vintage-inspired <a href=""https://www.madewell.com/feature/alexa-chung-collection/"">holiday collection</a> that pays homage to the East Village <em>and</em> East London.<br /><br />“We’ve been on a journey together, me and Madewell,” Chung tells Refinery29. “I’ve always made an effort to make things super personal, but this is definitely the most personal collection that we’ve collaborated on. It’s very vintage inspired and it’s also quite musically led, so it’s really specific to my tastes. I am thrilled with it.”<br /><br />From tried-and-true winter styles like oversized sweaters, crochet scarves, lacy slip dresses, and herringbone dress coats, to more <em>unexpected</em> styles like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/soccer-jersey-outfit-ideas-women"">football jerseys</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/white-jeans-styling-outfit-ideas"">white jeans</a>, and “We’re Witches Bitches” graphic tees, the collaboration perfectly reflects Chung’s “eclectic, specific, and cool” aesthetic.<br /><br />The nostalgic and romantic 31-piece collection also spans distressed <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/08/11495317/madewell-plus-size-denim-review"">Madewell jeans</a> and leather skirts and jackets, as well as giftable accessories like crew socks, hooded scarves, and floral brooches. Chung specifically recommends gifting one of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-statement-belts-women"">statement belts</a> for the holidays. “I love <a href=""https://www.madewell.com/p/NY939/?ccode=EX0001"">this belt</a> because it can cinch your waist over a dress, slung low with baggy jeans, or wear it over loads of coats. I love the idea of jewelry over outerwear, so I’d probably get someone one of the belts.”</p>

<p>And in terms of her winter wardrobe staple, Chung highlights the <a href=""https://www.madewell.com/p/NY883/?ccode=WR2252"">collection’s peacoat</a>. “The navy blue coat is my non-negotiable winter coat. It’s genuinely warm. It’s a classic silhouette. It’s a bit oversized, it’s quite boxy, but you can fit your sweater underneath. It just makes you feel quite handsome and powerful when you put it on,” she explains.<br /><br />Whether you’re shopping for $24 brooches to gift to your fashion-loving friends or a $598 leather jacket to treat yourself, every piece will help you channel It-girl Chung’s signature style… and perhaps even Meg Ryan’s? The model says that if any fictional character would wear this nostalgic collection, it would be one of Ryan’s rom-com characters from ‘90s-era movies like <em>When Harry Met Sally</em>, <em>Sleepless in Seattle</em>, and <em>You’ve Got Mail</em>.<br /><br />What more could we want from a cozy-season collection? We’ll have what Alexa’s having!</p>

Winter is long, and having cuddles on tap sounds quite nice. Hence <a href=""https://bumble.com/the-buzz/what-is-cuffing-season"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">cuffing season</a>: the period when people “cuff” another <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/friends-to-lovers-stories"">into a relationship</a> for the colder months. Sometimes we cuff or get cuffed consciously, other times less so — you may be cuffed and not realize the other person’s intentions. Either way, something about this time of year makes us want to shack up and be cozy with someone else.<br /><br />This feels like a lot of work, to find someone now and put in the effort for a relationship that will probably end with the change in seasons. Some research has put it down to a desire to avoid feeling lonely — as many as <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/datingcom-found-that-online-activity-hits-peak-season-during-cold-winter-months-300926222.html"">60% of people</a> turn to dating apps in winter for this reason. Where summer can be socially full-on and active, the prospect of an emptier calendar during winter might make swiping for dates more attractive. <br /><br />Like all relationships, some end horribly, others are over as quickly as they began and some manage to go the distance, like Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. Ahead, Refinery29 spoke to five women about their own cuffing season relationships — how they went, how they ended (or didn’t), and how they felt about it. <figure><figcaption><strong>Lila, 26, New York</strong><br /><br />I entered into a cuffing season relationship three to four months after breaking up with my boyfriend of two years. We talked for half of September, started seeing each other at the end of September, and went on dates until the end of November. We were intimate and I really liked the guy, although I thought things were too good to be true. <br /><br />I eventually went to look him up on social media at the end of October and saw he was anti-immigration, slightly MAGA and very incel-leaning (at least his Twitter likes were). I had made my politics very clear. I am very liberal and was actively outspoken at the time about Palestine and leftist ideals. It was so weird to see [his online activity] and I showed a bunch of my friends to make sure I wasn't crazy. <br /><br />Before I got to break up with him, he reached out and said he just wanted to be friends. He contacts me every so often with memes about my profession, and now he has become my seafood hookup (he works at a seafood market and whenever I want expensive seafood like scallops and oysters for free, I text him and he brings it to me. Nothing sexual there, he just hooks me up with free seafood!). Honestly, he was a rebound who should have never happened. I deleted the apps soon after that because I centered my interests towards engaging in my weekly therapy sessions.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><strong>Tiphani, 35, Mississippi</strong><br /><br />My last cuffing season relationship was hot and heavy. It started at the beginning of January and ended in February. We got snowed in together and he made an effort to Uber or Lyft back to my house if he had to go into work. He would cook every day. And we would lie around and watch movies and talk until bedtime. I didn’t think it was going to be temporary. I thought we were on the same page.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after the snow melted, the relationship also became a puddle. I tried to keep it going but the communication became almost nonexistent and I just had to block him, move on, and let it go. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><strong>Olivia, 28, London</strong><br /><br />I dated someone for four months who categorically did not fancy me. I don't think I really fancied him either. We met in September and in January he dumped me over text as soon as my plane landed back from Christmas break. New year, new him, I guess. I think I knew deep down there wasn't attraction — we barely connected physically and I told myself he was just shy and my self-esteem was low. It was low, but going out with someone who isn't attracted to you will do that. <br /><br />I realize now this was the end result of a ""year of dating"" I put myself through. I pressured myself to put in more time and effort and go on more dates, and by September I was exhausted and the nights were drawing in. So the first person who consistently asked me out on dates (and was not cheating on someone with me, or another such horror story), I just leapt at. We did all the seasonal winter stuff as he'd just moved to London, but I wish I'd spent more time doing that with my friends. I realized that a year on dating apps had set my bar so low that someone consistently asking me on the next date had become incredibly impressive. <br /><br />This season I feel just as burned out by dating if I am honest, but I realize going out with someone who doesn't like me is not the answer to that. I've joined a stand-up comedy course instead. <br /><br />Last week my friend informed me she ""doesn't date from October to April, it's just too cold"" and honestly? I might join her. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><strong>Kerry, 47, Melbourne </strong><br /><br />My cuffing season story goes back 10 years. We met doing a casual security stint at a comedy festival. Our relationship ended up lasting for a couple of years, on and off. Sometimes I'd get random calls saying, ""Guess who this is?"" after a break.<br /><br />He'd tell me I was very beautiful but that I was too old for him, especially in his Indian culture where this was frowned upon. I'm unsure if that was to placate me but he did find me attractive. We'd hook up at my place. Once it even happened at a work site!<br /><br />I got into this relationship knowing it was temporary. I wasn't fussed at all. We both knew that. Long term would have been too complicated. And that casualness wouldn’t work on me these days. My standards are much higher! The casualness worked at the time. Also, at the time it gave me confidence and boosted my self-esteem. Much later down the line though, when we were both married, he gave me a call. This annoyed me; it was as if he was expecting me to be alone, and I thought it a betrayal of his wife. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><strong>Shriya, 25, Virginia</strong><br /><br />I ended up getting in a cuffing season relationship two years ago with someone who turned out to be the love of my life and we're planning on being engaged soon. It was my most successful cuffing season of all time!<br /><br />We originally met in undergrad at the University of Pittsburgh. His best friend and I were friends so we crossed paths but we never had any conversations or expressed interest in each other. A couple years went by and we graduated. During the pandemic, a large group of our friends would finish work together on Zoom every night (about 30 people) and we joined in. He and I started talking on the side. We had a <em>really</em> long talking phase for months during cuffing season where neither of us said anything or even made the first move but you could tell we were clearly interested in seeing where it went. We just didn't know if we were going to see each other since he was in Kansas and I was in Virginia, so no one attached any hopes to the situation. Even when he asked me on our first date, he said, ""Hey, I'm coming to DC to see a couple friends, would you like to meet up?"" and I had to ask if it was a date to clarify. But once we went on the first date, it was game over. We've been together ever since.<br /><br />Everyone says when you know, you know, and it's very true. He asked to meet my parents the weekend of our first date, and a few weeks later he asked me to meet his. I think it was easier for us to jump in because our talking phase was so long that we had a chance to really know each other and vet the person first before jumping into a physical date.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939482.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings… we thought we were coasting to the finish line of 2025, but baby, the cosmos said, “Not so fast.” This week kicks off with a <em>mind maze</em> of epic proportions as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury begins its final retrograde</a> of the year <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">on November</a> 9 at 2:02 p.m. EST, and it’s happening in none other than Sagittarius — the sign of bold opinions, big dreams, and spontaneous “let’s go to Bali” texts. <br /><br />But under Mercury retrograde? Yeah… your GPS might glitch halfway through the journey. Sag energy loves to think big picture, but Mercury is trying to zoom in and say, “Wait, did you really mean that? Or were you just avoiding the details?” This is the kind of transit that makes you question your own hot takes. So if you suddenly backpedal on that workshop you were going to launch or rethink that long-distance situationship you were convinced was <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/moon-phases-meaning-astrology"">soulmate-level</a> last week, you’re not flaky… you’re realigning. </p>



<p>The upside? Mercury retrograde in Sagittarius helps us relearn how to tell the truth, not the curated one, but the gut-level, soul-naked kind. You might revise that book pitch, backtrack on those travel plans, or finally admit that your “freedom” narrative was really a fear of intimacy in disguise. Don’t rush. Let yourself unlearn what you thought was the truth. Just double-check your emails, avoid signing contracts unless necessary, and be open to divine redirections. A closed door is a cosmic yes in another language. <br /><br />Then comes a major <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-11-11-angel-number-november-2023"">energetic shift on 11/11</a>, a sacred astro-numerological portal, and this year it hits different because Jupiter, planet of expansion, luck, and vision, begins its retrograde journey in Cancer at 11:41 a.m. EST. This is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter’s first retrograde in Cancer</a> in over a decade, and it’s pulling our energy inward, homeward, and backward. Think: ancestral roots, childhood patterns, and that “do I even want to live here anymore?” conversation that keeps circling your brain. The answers come slowly, but they’re sacred. You might be called to downsize, simplify, or renovate — not just your space, but your lifestyle. Maybe you thought you wanted a bigger house, but now you crave a cozier, quieter one. Maybe you thought you wanted to raise kids in the city, but now you’re craving ocean air and moonlight. This isn’t about contraction. It’s about rooted expansion. Jupiter retrograde in Cancer reminds us that the dream isn’t real if you can’t rest in it. </p>



<p>On November 12, the Last Quarter Moon in Leo flares up the tension between your public self and your private desires. This is a shedding moon — one that asks: <em>Is the persona you’re performing still aligned with who you’re becoming?</em> Leo moons can make us crave attention, validation, and applause, but this one’s got a little edge to it. You might feel hyper-aware of who’s watching, liking, or not responding at all. But instead of spiraling, try this: let it go. Use this quarter moon to release the pressure to be seen and instead commit to <em>seeing yourself</em>. The right people will always feel you. And the rest? Dust. </p>



<p>The week wraps with the Virgo Moon taking over from November 13 to 15, bringing a calming wave of discernment; not the perfectionist kind, but the cleansing, clarifying kind. This is the “<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-2025-zodiac-signs"">get your life together</a>” moon, but with softness. There are only six weeks left in 2025. This moon isn’t here to shame you for what you didn’t get done… it’s here to help you see what’s still worth doing. Let it highlight what’s still alive in your spirit. Where are you still passionate? Where are you tired for no reason? With Mercury retrograde ruling Virgo from fiery Sagittarius, this is your reminder that just because something once excited you doesn’t mean it still fits your values now. This week is a reclamation. Of your voice, of your truth, of your energy. <br /><br />You can be wise, wild, and well rested. Let that be your mantra as we enter the final stretch of the year.  <br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, buckle up because Mercury retrograde in Sagittarius (starting November 9) is throwing some fire back in your direction… but not the type you can just power through. This retrograde hits your sector of expansion, travel, and publishing, so if you’ve got big plans, launches, interviews, or even far-off journeys on deck, double- and triple-check the logistics. You might feel misunderstood or even dragged online for something you said with the best of intentions — but instead of spiraling into defensiveness, use this time to ask yourself: <em>What do I actually believe, and is it still true for the version of me I’m becoming?</em> You’re not meant to shrink; you’re meant to refine. Editing your message, rethinking your audience, and getting clear about your voice doesn’t make you a sellout — it makes you someone with staying power. Think: slow down to go global. <br /><br />And then comes the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-11-11-angel-number-november-2023"">11/11 portal</a>, where Jupiter begins retrograding in Cancer, your sector of home, family, and emotional roots. <em>Whew</em>. That one might hit a little deeper than you expected. Whether it’s your literal home or your internal sense of safety, this retrograde is asking you to pause and reflect. Do you still want to live where you are? Are you ready to build something new — or rebuild something old, but on your terms this time? Some Aries might suddenly crave a simpler life, downsizing their lifestyle or revisiting childhood patterns that shaped how they seek comfort. Others might feel pulled to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/november-tarotscopes-messages-ancestors"">connect with their ancestors</a>, mend family dynamics, or even reimagine what “home” means — especially if the old definition was wrapped in performance or pressure. You don’t have to fix it all right now. But <em>feel it</em>. Jupiter’s reminding you that true growth starts at the root. </p>



<p>By the time the Virgo Moon arrives (November 13 to 15), your spirit’s like, <em>okay, enough existential spiraling</em>, let’s get back in the body. This earthy moon moves through your health and wellness sector, giving you a stabilizing moment in an otherwise reflective week. The good news? This moon doesn’t want you to perfect anything — it just wants you to notice. Notice where you’ve been neglecting routines that actually help you feel more alive. Notice the little habits that need tweaking. And more than anything, notice what your body has been trying to tell you, especially as your mind has been zooming into big-picture questions all week. This is your mid-month grounding ritual. Drink the tea. Stretch your back. Cancel the plan you didn’t want to go to anyway. You’re allowed to rest even in the middle of the chaos. Especially then. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury’s retrograde in Sagittarius</a> beginning November 9 might stir up more than just philosophical questions — it’s nudging you into the shadows of your own psyche, your intimacy sector, where power, vulnerability, and shared resources live. And yeah… it could get a little messy. Old debts (emotional or financial) might resurface. Someone you thought you were “done” with might pop back in with a question or an apology. Or maybe it’s you who’s suddenly feeling called to unpack past decisions — especially the ones you’ve quietly judged yourself for. <br /><br />This retrograde isn’t about punishment, it’s about integration. What part of you have you been hiding out of fear of rejection or loss? You’re being invited to reclaim it. Reclaim your power, even if that means fumbling your way through some uncomfortable convos or realizations. Growth rarely comes wrapped in silk — sometimes it shows up with receipts and a mirror. </p>



<p>Then, on 11/11, Jupiter begins its retrograde in Cancer, activating your communication and mindset zone — and that’s a big cosmic green light to slow your roll and listen more deeply. This isn’t about talking less, it’s about being more intentional with your voice. If you’re writing something big, launching something, or trying to have heart-to-hearts, give yourself space to revise, reword, or even re-feel what you’re trying to express. Childhood memories or old stories about your intelligence or communication style might resurface — not to haunt you, but to be rewritten with compassion. Are you speaking your truth… or the truth you think others expect from you? This is a powerful time to reconnect with your inner narrator and ask: <em>Is this the story I want to keep telling about myself?</em> If not, 11/11 is a beautiful portal for rewriting it. </p>



<p>By the time the Moon lands in Virgo from November 13 to 15, your creativity and joy sector becomes the stage for a mid-month emotional check-in. This isn’t about productivity — it’s about pleasure with purpose. Have you forgotten what makes you laugh? What makes you play? If you’ve been stuck in a loop of “doing the work,” this Moon invites you to remember why you’re doing it at all. Maybe it’s time to reconnect with your inner child, or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/creativity-art-therapy-classes"">tend to a creative project</a> that’s been whispering your name. Maybe you just need to dance around your room with your phone on airplane mode. </p>



<p>Whatever it is, don’t wait for permission to delight in being alive again. You’ve been deep in the waters all week — now let this Virgo Moon offer you earth to stand on, and joy to reach for. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, let’s be real: Mercury’s retrograde starting November 9 is going to hit different, because it’s happening in your relationship sector (in the sign of Sagittarius), and Mercury’s <em>your</em> ruling planet. So yeah, you’re gonna feel it. Expect some double-texting energy, some “Wait… what did they <em>really</em> mean by that?” vibes, and maybe a ghost or two reappearing just when you thought you were emotionally vaccinated. This isn’t about drama for the sake of drama, though. It’s about clarity. If you’ve been unclear about what you want in love, business partnerships, or even creative collaborations, this retrograde could shake the dust off that indecision. Misunderstandings may happen, but they’re revealing what needs to be refined. And hey, if an ex pops up and you’re tempted? Ask yourself: Is this curiosity, closure, or an escape from what’s actually available to you right now? <br /><br />Then there’s 11/11 — a major portal, and the same day Jupiter begins its retrograde in Cancer, which lights up your money and self-worth sector. This is deep. Like, ancestral beliefs about abundance deep. You might find yourself revisiting <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/starting-investing-real-stories"">decisions around savings, investing</a>, or even the ways you’ve been undervaluing yourself in business or relationships. If you’ve been hustling for approval or centering others’ needs out of fear of rejection, this week will lovingly (or not so lovingly) ask you to stop. You are not a backup dancer in your own life. Jupiter here says: <em>take up more space — but the retrograde says, first, check where you’ve been shrinking</em>. Maybe it’s time to raise your rates. Maybe it’s time to cut off a draining energetic tie that’s been taking more than it gives. Either way, your value isn’t negotiable, even if your pricing strategy is. </p>



<p>The Moon in Virgo from November 13 to 15 activates your home and emotional roots sector, and it’s basically a cosmic reminder to stop skipping the warm-up. You don’t have to be “on” all the time, Gem. You don’t even have to be figuring things out. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/you-look-happier-trend-embracing-messiness"">You’re allowed to simply be: messy</a>, soft, still. Clean your space if that helps you breathe easier. Make your bed like it’s an act of devotion. Call someone who reminds you of who you were before the world told you to hurry. This isn’t a weekend to impress; it’s a weekend to nourish. Let the Virgo Moon guide you back to rituals that restore your nervous system and ground your ideas. The clarity you’re craving isn’t out there — it’s in the quiet corners you’ve been too busy to visit. Go home to yourself. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, Mercury retrograde begins in your wellness, work, and routines sector on November 9, and let’s be real — if your body’s been whispering (or screaming) for rest, this is your sign to listen. This transit is like a cosmic timeout, forcing you to re-evaluate what “productivity” even means to you. Maybe you’ve been running on autopilot, saying yes out of guilt or fear instead of alignment. Maybe you’re craving a slower, softer pace but worried that if you stop, everything will collapse. Spoiler: it won’t. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrograde in Sagittarius</a> is clumsy and chaotic, yes… but also philosophical. It invites you to pull back from the grind and ask: What’s the point of all this effort if your joy and peace aren’t part of the equation? <br /><br />Then comes a cosmic curveball and blessing wrapped in one: Jupiter begins its retrograde in your sign on 11/11, and Cancer, this is <em>big</em>. You’ve been expanding so much this year, maybe even faster than your inner world could keep up with. This retrograde is here to help you integrate. To help you reclaim what you’ve given away in the name of growth, people-pleasing, or perfection. You might revisit decisions you made earlier this year with fresh eyes, and this time, you’ll choose differently. You may downsize, cancel a major plan, or close a door that once felt full of promise — not because you’ve failed, but because you’ve evolved. Think of this as a soul homecoming: a re-rooting. And with your planetary ruler, the Moon, lighting up your sector of self-worth during the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/super-beaver-full-moon-in-taurus-horoscope-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Taurus Full Moon</a> just days ago, your standards have risen — including the standards you hold for <em>yourself</em>. </p>



<p>As the Virgo Moon arrives November 13 to 15, things get even more introspective, but in the best, most clarifying way. This lunation activates your communication and learning sector, so consider it <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-say-no-to-friends"">your permission slip to say no</a>, mute the noise, and re-curate your reality. Read something that expands your mind. Journal without editing. Take a walk without your phone and let your own thoughts be the soundtrack. Even if retrograde chaos swirls around you, you’re building something quieter and more grounded inside. </p>



<p>Something sacred. The second half of the week is like a mid-month recalibration: Where do you need to simplify? What ideas need breathing room? Virgo wants you to declutter your mind, and Cancer, that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-protect-your-peace"">starts with choosing peace</a> over performance. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, Mercury starts its final retrograde of the year on November 9 in your creativity, joy, and romance sector, and let’s just say, things might get <em>messy-hot</em> or <em>hot-messy</em> real quick. You might reconnect with a past lover (or crush), find yourself rewriting an old creative idea, or even second-guessing the ways you express your joy. Retrogrades aren’t meant to stall you, they’re meant to rewire you, so if your flirt game feels off or your passion projects aren’t clicking, don’t force it. Play. Revisit your old journals, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/inner-child-healing"">revisit your inner child</a>. This retrograde wants to remind you that your creativity doesn’t have to be profitable, and your love doesn’t have to be performative. It just has to be <em>real</em>. <br /><br />Then on 11/11, a deeply emotional shift arrives: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter begins its retrograde in Cancer</a>, your sector of healing, rest, and closure. This is not the time to push. This is the time to soften. Some Leos may realize they’ve been carrying emotions that aren’t even theirs. Others may find themselves shedding ego identities that once felt protective — the performer, the leader, the strong one — in favor of deeper truth. You’re realizing that being seen isn’t always about being loud or perfect; it’s about being honest. Jupiter retro in Cancer helps you make peace with the past, with the versions of yourself you no longer need to be. Don’t be surprised if you find yourself yearning for solitude, sacred spaces, or spiritual nourishment. Let that be your compass. </p>



<p>As the Moon shifts into Virgo from November 13 to 15, you’ll feel a subtle but steady return to your values, money, and worth. You may be tempted to “fix” everything that feels off: your budget, your habits, your schedule, but the deeper ask is to center what actually sustains you. Not just financially, but emotionally, spiritually, physically. This Virgo Moon is your mid-month check-in: What’s been draining your light, and what’s been keeping it alive? The answers may not be flashy, but they’ll be <em>true</em>. Let simplicity lead. Let pleasure be enough. Let this week be a sacred act of recalibration — not so you can perform again, but so you can live more fully from your own center. </p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, Mercury, your planetary ruler, begins its final retrograde of the year on November 9, in Sagittarius, in your sector of home, roots, and emotional foundations. This one’s going to feel personal. You might feel the urge to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/digital-decluttering-how-to"">declutter everything in sight</a>, rearrange your furniture, or suddenly feel overwhelmed by family dynamics you thought were behind you. This isn’t regression; it’s excavation. If old patterns arise, especially around caretaking, over-functioning, or needing to be “the responsible one,” pause before reacting. Mercury retrograde wants to rewire your foundation from the inside out — so let yourself grieve, journal, question, and even nap more than usual. You’re making room for the version of home that feels more chosen than inherited. </p>



<p>Then on 11/11, the ascension portal cracks open as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter retrogrades in Cancer</a>, illuminating your community and friendship sector. You may start to ask: Who really holds me? Who sees me when I’m not performing? Who do I trust to witness me in my becoming? This transit invites you to slow down your networking pace, rethink the roles you play in your social circles, and re-evaluate what solidarity actually looks like for you. Some Virgos may reconnect with old friends or communities that once brought joy, while others may realize they’ve outgrown certain connections — and that’s okay. Jupiter in retrograde is a cosmic blessing in disguise: it peels away the performance and leaves the soul. <br /><br />From November 13 to 15, the Moon moves through your sign, and you’ll feel it like a subtle inner drumbeat returning you to yourself. It’s a reminder that you don’t need to do more or fix more to be worthy of ease. This is your mid-month reset. Instead of obsessing over what isn’t working, focus on nourishing what is. Ground yourself in rituals that feel like medicine — whether it’s meal prepping, doing absolutely nothing, or getting lost in a book. Let yourself be the thing you take care of this time. The world can wait — your healing can’t. </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, Mercury retrogrades in Sagittarius on November 9, lighting up your communication, learning, and local environment sector. So let’s be real: your words may trip over themselves this week, even when your heart is clear. That brilliant idea? It might need a few more rounds of refinement before you hit publish. The text you didn’t mean to send, the meeting you show up to on the wrong day… it’s all part of the cosmic comedy. But beneath the mix-ups, something deeper’s being rewritten. What are you <em>really</em> trying to say, Libra? What truths have you been avoiding out of politeness or fear of rocking the boat? Mercury’s slowdown invites you to get honest — not just with others, but with yourself. You don’t always have to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10751082/should-you-trust-your-gut-instinct"">translate your intuition</a> into something digestible. <br /><br />Then on November 11 (11/11 portal), Jupiter begins its retrograde in Cancer, in your career and public image sector. If it feels like the outside world is slowing down just as you were picking up steam… that’s not a glitch, it’s divine timing. This retrograde asks you to <em>redefine success</em> on your terms. Maybe you’re not as excited about that promotion as you thought you’d be. Maybe a long-held goal no longer fits who you’re becoming. Jupiter in Cancer wants to root your ambitions in emotional truth, not external validation. You might find yourself craving a softer, more sustainable way of showing up in the world — one that honors your boundaries, your rest, your art. Let the discomfort guide you home. </p>



<p>The Moon in Virgo from November 13 to 15 activates your healing and subconscious sector, making this a powerful time to retreat, recalibrate, and listen to the whispers within. You don’t need to explain your absence. You don’t need to earn your stillness. Let this lunar energy be a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/staycation-digital-detox-personal-essay"">permission slip to say no, log off, close the tab</a>, and take the long way home. You are allowed to rest in the in-between. The clarity will come — but not if you chase it. Let it find you in the quiet. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio</a>, Mercury begins its retrograde in Sagittarius on November 9, in your money, values, and self-worth sector, and this one’s hitting close to home — literally and emotionally. It might bring some financial delays or confusion: think forgotten payments, tech glitches with invoices, or miscommunications around collaborations. But beyond the surface-level chaos, this is a deeply clarifying period. Mercury’s slowdown is asking: What do you <em>actually value</em>? Are you hustling out of fear instead of alignment? This retrograde wants to help you reassess your entire relationship with abundance. Maybe what you need isn’t more… maybe it’s a better understanding of what “enough” means for you now. </p>



<p>Then on 11/11, Jupiter begins its retrograde in Cancer, in your expansion, travel, and spiritual wisdom sector — and this is big. You may feel a sudden urge to cancel a trip, re-route a plan, or pull back from something you once thought was your “big break.” Let it happen. Jupiter’s moonlit retrograde is less about going somewhere and more about <em>returning</em> — to a truth, a purpose, or even an ancestor’s whisper you’ve been too busy to hear. You don’t have to chase enlightenment. You can live it in the quiet rituals, the daydreams, the pauses. This is the kind of transit that asks: What beliefs are outdated? What stories about yourself no longer fit who you’re becoming? </p>



<p>From November 13 to 15, the Moon in Virgo <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/friendships"">energizes your community, friendship</a>, and long-term vision sector, and it’s here to help you sift through the noise. You’re realizing which social circles genuinely support your evolution and which ones subtly hold you back. Take stock of who you’re spending your precious time with. Are your connections reciprocal, or are you always the one holding space? Let the Virgo Moon guide you to organize your goals into tangible steps — no need for perfection. Just discernment, honesty, and a soft plan to carry you through these retrograde waters. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, Mercury begins its final retrograde of the year in your sign on November 9, and you’ll likely feel it in your bones before you can name it. You might suddenly second-guess things you once felt 100% sure about: your image, your direction, even how you’ve been showing up lately. This isn’t a punishment, it’s a mirror. Mercury retrograde in your sign is like a cosmic mic check: Are your words aligned with your beliefs? Have your intentions kept up with your growth? If you’re misunderstood or if your message gets lost in translation this week, don’t panic. Take it as a signal to fine tune, not silence. You’re evolving. Your truth is too. </p>



<p>Then on 11/11, Jupiter retrogrades in Cancer, activating your sector of intimacy, shared resources, and emotional entanglements, and things get deep. A past entanglement, contract, or collaboration might resurface, and it’s not necessarily to restart it, but to reflect. This could be about <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/personal-loans-real-examples"">money you loaned</a>, energy you overextended, or emotional investments that didn’t yield what you expected. Jupiter’s message here is loud: It’s time to reclaim your power by reexamining the places where you’ve over-given or under-valued your own needs. You might also feel a pull to tend to ancestral healing — themes of trust, survival, and legacy could come up, and they’re not here to haunt you, but to free you. </p>



<p>As the Moon moves through Virgo from November 13 to 15, your career and reputation sector lights up with earthy precision. While everything else may feel foggy or slowed down by retrogrades, this lunar transit helps you <em>ground your goals</em>. Clean up your calendar. Edit that proposal. Check your online bios — they might need updating. It’s not about doing more, it’s about doing better. You’re learning to build a life that fits the version of you that’s emerging, not the one who was hustling out of habit. Let this week guide you to work smarter, live slower, and speak more intentionally. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, Mercury begins its final retrograde of the year on November 9, in Sagittarius, your sector of spirituality, solitude, and endings. This one’s a little slippery. You may feel unusually foggy, sleepy, or overstimulated and disoriented all at once. It’s because your mind is trying to do what your spirit hasn’t caught up with yet. This is a week for remembering that not everything needs to be shared, explained, or understood immediately. Mercury retrograde is asking you to hit pause on external obligations and listen to your inner world. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/recurring-dreams-meaning"">Dreams may get weirder</a>. Gut instincts stronger. You’re shedding thought patterns you didn’t realize were weighing you down. Let it happen in layers. </p>



<p>Then on the sacred 11/11 portal, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter retrograde shifts into Cancer</a>, in your sector of relationships and contracts. Whether it’s a romantic partner, a business agreement, or an old commitment that’s expired, this transit is here to bring it all back to the surface. If something feels unfinished — it is. But this is not about reopening old wounds just to relive them. It’s about integrating what you’ve learned. This transit may challenge you to confront where you’ve overextended yourself in partnerships or allowed resentment to fester under the surface. On the flip side, it may illuminate where you’ve been too guarded to let real intimacy in. Either way, the invitation is to reimagine how you relate — not from survival, but from reciprocity. <br /><br />From November 13 to 15, the Moon in Virgo lights up your sector of truth, travel, and expansion. You may find yourself craving an escape, but not necessarily a physical one. This might be the week you get lost in a book, sign up for a course, or revisit a philosophy that once anchored you. It’s the perfect time to assess what you’ve outgrown and what still resonates. Virgo’s clarity will help you map out the next leg of your soul journey… just don’t rush to have it all figured out. Let your sense of direction come from stillness, not pressure. You’re growing in silence this week, and it’s exactly what you need. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury begins its final retrograde</a> of the year on November 9, in Sagittarius, your sector of community, vision, and long-term goals. If you’ve been go-go-go with big ideas, collaborations, or social media visibility, this is your cue to pause and reassess. Are you creating from your truth, or just trying to keep up? Mercury retrograde might bring a few tech glitches, scheduling delays, or misunderstandings among friends or team members. But it’s also a golden opportunity to get real about where your energy is going and why. Use this transit to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-2025-zodiac-signs"">revise your vision board</a> — metaphorically or literally. Who are you becoming, and who do you need around you to help make that future feel real? </p>



<p>Then comes 11/11, the astro-numerological portal, and with it, Jupiter retrogrades into Cancer, your sector of wellness, service, and daily rituals. This is less about productivity and more about sustainability. Jupiter here wants you to zoom out and ask: Is the way I live each day aligned with how I say I want to feel? Are you overgiving at work or neglecting your body’s requests for rest, nourishment, and movement? Maybe it’s time to simplify your routine, or even re-evaluate the kind of work you’re doing entirely. This transit might stir memories of past jobs, health routines, or caretaking roles that shaped your current reality — not to haunt you, but to help you release what’s no longer needed. </p>



<p>From November 13 to 15, the Moon in Virgo lands in your sector of intimacy, trust, and emotional transformation. You may find yourself quietly craving deeper connection, not just with others, but with the parts of yourself you’ve avoided. The Virgo Moon wants you to cleanse. This could look like journaling through a fear, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/budgeting-tools-spending-diary"">organizing your finances</a>, or even deleting an old situationship’s number once and for all. Let this be a ritual of release. Mercury may be retrograde, but clarity is still available — especially when you’re honest about what you’ve outgrown. Make room for intimacy that feels like ease, not performance. You deserve that. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, Mercury begins its retrograde journey in Sagittarius on November 9, activating your career, visibility, and life direction sector. This <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-is-deja-vu-meaning"">could feel like déjà vu</a> in the workplace, where past projects resurface or delayed recognition finally makes its way to you, but with strings attached. You may find yourself rethinking your goals or even reconsidering what “success” looks like for you. Are you chasing someone else’s version of accomplishment? Or is it time to give yourself permission to redefine what lights you up? Double-check important emails and deadlines, but also check in with your higher self — she might be whispering a totally different route forward. </p>



<p>Then comes 11/11, and your planetary ruler Jupiter retrogrades into Cancer, in your sector of creativity, romance, and self-expression. This is where the magic gets personal. A love from the past could resurface, not necessarily for reunion, but for reflection. You might feel pulled back into old creative dreams you once abandoned, wondering, “What if?” Jupiter’s slow dance in Cancer invites you to nurture your inner child and revisit the art forms or love stories that once brought you joy. If you’re a parent or mentor, this could be a healing period for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/millennial-aunts-uncles-nibling-social-media"">bonding with the young people</a> in your life, or with your own youthful spirit. Let yourself be moved. </p>



<p>From November 13 to 15, the Moon in Virgo illuminates your relationship and one-on-one connection sector. It’s a clarifying lunar moment that may reveal where boundaries need adjusting, or where walls need softening. Whether you’re single, partnered, or in something undefined, the Virgo Moon brings discernment without coldness. Take this time to have the talk, send the email, or write the letter (even if you never send it). You’re learning to show up more authentically in partnership, but also to honor your solitude. Clarity is not closure, it’s a doorway. Walk through with grace. </p>

<p>When <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/04/196438/nina-simone-rock-hall-induction-beyonce-tribute-lauryn-hill-sister-rosetta-tharpe"">Nina Simone</a> said “an artist’s duty, as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times,” she wasn’t referring to only the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/most-impactful-tv-shows"">moments in history</a> that feel like sunshine and roses. The iconic singer and activist meant the dark and ugly parts, too. </p>



<p>Lately, however, there’s been an alarming trend of people in power <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVG7PNTZbtM"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">censoring art that reflects reality</a>. Just recently, Apple TV postponed the release of <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jessica-chastain-the-savant-delay-will-it-be-released-apple-1236406858/""><em>The</em> <em>Savant</em></a><em> </em>in the weeks following Charlie Kirk’s assassination. The series follows an investigator (Jessica Chastain) who interferes with white supremacist organizations before mass shootings occur. In a statement to <a href=""https://deadline.com/2025/09/jessica-chastain-does-not-agree-apple-the-savant-postponed-1236554606/"">Deadline</a>, a spokesperson for the streaming platform said, “After careful consideration, we have made the decision to postpone The Savant,” adding that it would be released at a later date. <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jessica-chastain-the-savant-delay-will-it-be-released-apple-1236406858/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chastain expressed her disappointment</a> on Instagram, stating that “we’ve seen an unfortunate amount of violence in the United States” since they began making the show five years ago. </p>

<p>This is just one example of Hollywood executives <a href=""https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/after-jimmy-kimmels-show-was-suspended-a-key-question-is-does-the-fcc-have-the-power-to-regulate-speech"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">canceling or suspending shows</a> and movies seemingly in immediate response to headlines of the day. Their statements may be broad, and their actions may do little more than appease shareholders, but the consistent <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62le8q959yo"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">attacks on freedom of speech</a> and expression through the arts do nothing but hold the entertainment industry — and society — back.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s worth praising the TV shows and films that confront the times instead of running from them. These are the best series and movies that have refused to shy away from the social and political climates they were made in. </p>

<h2><strong><em>Fruitvale Station </em></strong>(2013)</h2>







<p>The world was introduced to the genius of Ryan Coogler through <em>Fruitvale Station</em>, a poignant film that highlights the final day of Oscar Grant’s life. Portrayed by Michael B. Jordan, Grant was <a href=""https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/10-years-since-oscar-grant-s-death-what-13489585.php"">killed at age 22</a> on New Years Day in 2009 by Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer Johannes Mehserle. The killing occurred in Oakland, California — Coogler’s hometown — but the film resonated across the nation, and with timely reason: It debuted one year after the killing of Trayvon Martin, an event that sparked protests nationwide and ignited the Black Lives Matter movement in a formal way. State-sanctioned and racist violence was all too common, yet it had been long ignored on the silver screen. Coogler’s directorial debut shined a light on the deadly cost of institutionalized racism that the United States has yet to contend with. <strong><em>Watch now on Prime Video.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>Watchmen </em></strong>(2019)</h2>







<p>Regina King is the true hero of this HBO limited series, adapted from the DC Comics graphic novels of the same name. Though <em>Watchmen</em> is set in a present-day alternate universe, it’s based on the true horrors of the <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tulsa-race-massacre-100-years_n_60a574b2e4b0313547925c09"">Tulsa Race Massacre</a> that took place in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1921, in which white supremacists targeted an area of town known as Black Wall Street for its thriving Black-owned businesses. Unlike in reality, the descendants of the massacre receive reparations, leaving resentment amongst the white supremacist group known as the Seventh Kavalry. King is a masked vigilante on a mission to put an end to the group’s pattern of racial violence. <em>Watchmen</em> also stars Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Jeremy Irons, and Jean Smart as their characters must confront their own ethics in ways they’ve never had to before.. This nine-episode series is a masterclass in rich, nuanced storytelling about the traumas that wounds inflicted from racism hold — and the inherited pain that ensues if not addressed head-on. With the resurfacing of white nationalism and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/22/us-black-history-dei"">erasure of historical facts </a>on federal and state levels, this prescient show is absolutely worth a rewatch today. <strong><em>Stream now on HBO Max.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>One Battle After Another </em></strong>(2025)</h2>







<p>There’s a reason Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest has been heralded as one of the best films of 2025 while also spinning <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/one-battle-after-another-conservative-reactions-1236394128/"">conservatives into a tizzy</a>. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Teyana Taylor, and Chase Infiniti, and highlights the cost and complexities of serving as part of a revolution. Though <em>One Battle After Another</em> doesn’t specify what the protagonists are fighting for other than freedom, it’s evident that patriarchal and white supremacists systems are a known enemy. (Sound familiar?) The film tackles racism, sexism, xenophobia, and classism as the main characters reunite after decades of inactivity in the effort to save the daughter of one of their own. A secondary plot focusing on immigrant rights reflects the reality of so many people and families who have recently been targeted by ICE raids under Trump’s regime; markedly, the film spares no punches in its depiction of this violence. <strong>One Battle After Another<em> is in theaters now with a digital release date of November 20.</em></strong></p>

<h2><strong><em>The Morning Show </em></strong>(4 seasons, 2019-present)</h2>







<p>Season after season, this Apple TV series understands the assignment. Starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, <em>The Morning Show</em> is a novel depiction of the inner workings of the media, this time from a nationally syndicated morning show on a major network. Each season, these journalists are impacted personally and professionally by major events happening in the world, from the #MeToo movement to the pandemic to the rise of artificial intelligence. Throughout the series, they must contend with a changing media landscape that leads to layoffs and a challenging environment for journalism to thrive. Watching this four-season show can be triggering for those working in the industry. Binge at your own risk.<strong><em> Stream now on AppleTV.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>Adolescence</em></strong> (2024)</h2>







<p>This Netflix original is an uncomfortably ugly ride that exposes the life-threatening dangers of the digital manosphere. Owen Cooper plays a 13-year-old named Jaime, who — despite coming from a solid home with a seemingly normal foundation — is arrested for killing a female classmate who declined his advances. The four-episode series is a devastating depiction of how the dark corners of social media and the internet at large are <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/oct/21/why-the-manosphere-clicked-for-young-men-a-visual-deep-dive"">radicalizing young men</a> today. <strong><em>Stream now on</em></strong> <em><strong>Netflix.</strong></em></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>Her</em></strong><strong> </strong>(2013)</h2>







<p><em>Her</em> isn’t a horror film — but it might soon become a documentary, as a recent Vantage Point Counseling Services study showed that almost a third of Americans have admitted to having an <a href=""https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/americans-romantic-relationships-ai-chatbot-study-b2838217.html"">intimate or romantic relationship</a> with an AI chatbot. That is more or less the premise of this film, which stars Joaquin Phoenix as the lonely and introverted Theodore Twombly. Fresh off a divorce, Theodore falls in love with Samantha, a chatbot voiced by Scarlett Johansson. Though the Spike Jonze feature premiered more than a decade ago, it eerily predicted the moment in time we currently live in, particularly as a <a href=""https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/usable-knowledge/24/10/what-causing-our-epidemic-loneliness-and-how-can-we-fix-it"">loneliness epidemic</a> and advancements in generative AI converge. <strong><em>Watch now on Netflix.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em></strong> (6 seasons, 2017-2025)</h2>







<p>Watching this dystopian Hulu series is sombering, especially in a post-<em>Roe v. Wade </em>society. Based on Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, the Emmy-winning series takes place in the Republic of Gilead, a totalitarian nation that was once the United States. Its power-hungry men have made laws that subjugate women to follow an extreme set of laws that essentially gives the government total control of their bodies. It is illegal for them to read, vote, divorce, and freely express themselves in any way. June Osborne (Elizabeth Moss) is one of the few fertile women left in Gilead; for this, she is captured, enslaved, and forced to become a surrogate for a Commander and his wife. The torture, abuse, and dehumanizing conditions these characters experience make this show a hard watch, especially as lawmakers <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/health/usaid-contraceptives-destroyed-trump.html"">continue to police</a> <a href=""https://19thnews.org/2025/09/texas-abortion-pill-ban/"">and chip away</a> <a href=""https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2025/09/birth-control-incorrectly-labeled-as-abortifacients-by-trump-administration.html"">at women’s reproductive rights</a> at the federal and local level. <strong><em>Stream now on Hulu.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>The Last Black Man in San Francisco</em></strong> (2019)</h2>







<p>Gentrification has been a hot button topic for quite some time, but seeing how it’s depicted in <em>The Last Black Man in San Francisco</em> gives the conversation around it a fresh lens. The film centers on Jimmie Fails, a third-generation San Franciscan holding onto the Victorian home his grandfather supposedly built despite it no longer belonging to his family. When the home’s white former tenants vacate, Jimmie moves out of his friend’s apartment in a low-income neighborhood that’s built on toxic waste and begins squatting. The realities of the movie continue to this day: As the cost of living in one of the country’s <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/16/income-needed-to-live-comfortably-in-most-expensive-us-cities.html"">most expensive cities</a> continues to rise, <a href=""https://capitalbnews.org/black-displacement-gentrification-watts-study/"">communities established by people of color</a> have only become whiter and whiter. This Sundance Film Festival winner maintains its relevancy as Black and Brown neighborhoods across the country contend with what “home” looks like when so many of their neighbors are being displaced. <strong><em>Rent now on Prime Video or AppleTV.</em></strong></p>



<h2><strong><em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em></strong> (2018)</h2>







<p>Barry Jenkins masterfully adapts James Baldwin’s novel of the same name into the beautiful love story. Fonny and Tish are a young, Black couple from Harlem. Their relationship is tragically interrupted when Fonny is falsely accused of raping a white woman and thrown in prison. Though the film depicts the tragedy of mass incarceration and corruption, it takes care to treat the families impacted by these systemic travesties with  sophistication and dignity. The moral of <em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em> is that no matter what systems try to break love, its resiliency is undeniable.<strong><em> Watch now on Prime Video.</em></strong></p>



<h2><strong><em>The Big Short</em></strong> (2015)</h2>







<p>The housing crisis took place in 2008 but Adam McKay’s <em>The Big Short</em> still feels eerily relevant. Starring Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, and Brad Pitt, it takes a comedic approach to explaining how a group of investors predicted that a crash was coming and bet against the banks. They won big while the rest of the country went into an economic downward spiral. The Oscar-winning film depicted the role Wall Street’s greed played in causing The Great Recession. While other factors certainly contributed to the economic realities of 2008 and the following years, the film still hits as today’s everyday Americans increasingly feel financial strain. <strong><em>Watch now on Paramount+</em></strong>.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>Don’t Look Up</em></strong> (2021)</h2>







<p>As a comet hurls towards Earth, two astronomers (Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence) try to warn the global population in this Adam McKay-directed film. Few are taking this death star seriously, however — including the U.S. president. <em>Don’t Look Up </em>follows DiCaprio and Lawrence’s charaters as they take matters into their own hands and warn the general public. Political hijinks ensues as the comet becomes a divisive issue rather than a rallying cry for action. Though a comet is the big threat in this film, it feels like a metaphor for many things, including the looming dangers of climate change and the gullibility of viewers who believe something is “fake news” because a politician told them so. <strong><em>Watch now on Netflix. </em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>Severance</em></strong> (2 seasons, 2022-present)</h2>







<p>This Emmy Award-winning Apple TV series premiered after the onset of the Covid pandemic and the work-from-home era, when many Americans had the time to assess their relationship with their work. Seasons don’t exist in the cold and dreary town run by Lumon, the company that sells the dream of a true work-life balance by literally severing their personalities into two. Their workplaces selves (innies) don’t know anything about their outside selves (outies). What initially seems like the ideal technology becomes an actual living hell for a group of employees who have effectively lost their free will. <strong><em>Stream now on AppleTV.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>The Wire</em></strong> (5 seasons, 2002-2009)</h2>







<p>A hallmark of prestige television since the moment it debuted in 2002, <em>The Wire</em> should be required viewing for anyone looking to pursue careers in law enforcement, journalism, local government, or the legal field. Set in Baltimore, the HBO original chronicles institutions on each side of the drug trade and examines how cops, drug dealers, reporters, lawyers, teachers, and blue-collar workers are all connected by the same system. Creator David Simon paints a vivid picture of the toll political corruption, racism, and addiction take on both individual people and the entire city. Though specific to the Maryland city in its accents and details, the show’s message easily applies to other urban cities across the country. <strong><em>Stream now on HBO Max.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>After The Hunt</em></strong> (2025)</h2>







<p><em>After The Hunt</em> poses a frustratingly timeless question: Who gets to be the perfect victim? Ayo Edebiri stars as Maggie Price, a queer Black student at Yale University whose family is filthy rich. This complex background — a mix of privilege and marginalization — as well as her suspected missteps call her integrity into question after she accuses a male instructor of raping her. Julia Roberts plays Alma Olsson, Maggie’s professor and mentor, who has to make a decision: Support her mentee as Maggie seeks to hold her abuser accountable, or side with her colleague with whom she shares romantic chemistry. The film challenges assumptions as it holds an uncomfortable mirror to the ways in which modern society still views consent and cancel culture.<strong> After the Hunt <em>was in theaters in October and will be released digitally on PrimeVideo soon.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em><strong>I May Destroy You </strong></em><strong>(1 season, 2020)</strong></h2>







<p>The series created by and starring Michaela Coel premiered two years after bombshell allegations against Hollywood mega-producer Harvey Weinstein thrust Tarana Burke’s #MeToo movement into the national spotlight and sparked widespread conversations about sexual assault, harassment, and survivorhood. It’s a visceral but necessary watch. The show centers on three main characters as they navigate what it means to heal after being subjected to sexual violence. In just one season, <em>I May Destroy You</em> tackled the messy, dark, harrowing reality of what it means to process sexual assault and maintain a sense of your own agency as a survivor. <strong><em>Stream now on HBO Max.</em></strong></p>

<p>Jupiter, the planet of divine wisdom and luck, will be moonwalking in the water sign Cancer <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">from November</a> 11, 2025 (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-11-11-angel-number-november-2023"">11/11 is the 1111 portal</a> to success — hopefully that transcends to the overall energy of Jupiter retrograde…fingers crossed) to March 11, 2026. The next four months will be when we rethink what makes us secure and safe, which is unraveling because the expansive planet is moving more slowly, making matters seem more difficult and bigger than they need to be. Reassessing relationships and family dynamics will be a big story during the holiday season and Valentine’s Day, since we are determining who and what we wish to take into the new year with us. We have gained insight into the actual colors and motives of others; now, we must plan how we should move forward. <br /><br />Although we like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-in-cancer-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Jupiter in Cancer</a> (this is the sign of Jupiter’s exaltation), the flipside is that it can also harm our lives. Jupiter always takes big swings and makes huge bets to win large. The caveat is that we’ll get minimal returns on investments and wagers. The stakes are high, so don’t play in a higher bracket and above our capabilities to ensure we lose less. The same applies to relationships — protecting our energy and deciphering who we let into our hearts ensures that we won’t hurt when it comes to romantic partnerships and friendships. Another theme at play is travel. Jupiter retrograde might make us stay close to home, harness delays, or cause us to be in closer proximity to family. </p>



<p>The planetary backspin occurs amidst two <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrogrades</a> — that’s right, this transit will add to the intensity. The Mercurial backspin from November 9 to 29 in Sagittarius <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">and Scorpio</a> gets immense drama from Jupiter’s backward rotation. We’ll be more reflective than usual and unsure about our circumstances. The Mercury retrograde that backstrokes in Pisces from February 26 to March 20 makes our emotions extremely tender. We may have to cry out our sentiments to release them. Carry a pack of tissues everywhere in case they are needed because the slightest comments or annoyances could set us off at these times.<br /><br />Other planets, such as Saturn and Neptune in Pisces, and Uranus in Taurus will also be retrograde for the majority of the time. As a result, we’ll be apt to be in an ocean of emotions. It’ll be hard to set our sights on newness, as the cosmos are pulling us backward. The tides are high, resulting in cautious behavior. There will be moments when we act on impulsive, but it’s advisable to meditate on matters a few times before taking charge. <br /><br />As with all retrogrades, prepare for the unexpected. Go with the flow to ensure smooth sailing. Doing so can make a huge difference because we won’t overthink or stress so hard. Good luck! </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941439.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>PSA: The final <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9903579/is-mercury-retrograde-bad"">Mercury retrograde</a> of 2025 is the messiest. The optical illusion, which is caused by Mercury’s slow motion, causes disruption and disorder to earthlings. The disruptive transit affects us so much that it’s become impossible to ignore and part of our modern lexicon. This month, we’ll be drowning in the theatrics — make sure your life preserver is fastened. <br /><br />At the same time, four other planets are moonwalking in the cosmos: Jupiter (which turns retrograde on November 11), Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Prep for emo interactions with people we’ve long forgotten or resentments to come out into the open. We will not be able to get a hold of our words, resulting in us saying potentially offensive statements that we’ll regret. So, don’t drunk dial, email, text, DM, or lurk your ex’s social media after a few cocktails with friends from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">November 9 to 29</a>, expecting them to be empathetic or vice versa.</p>



<p>Before November 9, the pre-retrograde began on October 21 in Sagittarius. Look at the dates from October 21 to November 9 to determine the story that will consume the most energy during the retrograde. This is the first time we trace over the degrees. We dive into the retrograde backtracking on these degrees. When the retrograde is over, we move forward and deal with the same degrees one last time from November 29 to December 16, when the planet moves back to the place and sign it was in on October 21. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-november-2024-meaning-effects"">T</a>his third moment is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-november-2024-meaning-effects"">referred to as “retroshade”</a> because we are making final decisions based on the discoveries and observations made in the past weeks. Now that Mercury is direct, we can assess matters with a keen eye. <br /><br />Mercury retrograde in Sagittarius can make us more erratic and demanding. Basically, we’ll have no chill. We may become highly reactive and less reasonable, resulting in irrational exchanges with others. When Mercury backs up <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">into Scorpio</a>, it’ll allow us to understand relationships and our feelings after several hours or days of introspection. Our spy senses are overactive, leading to paranoia. The key to calm is to not crash over a tidbit of gossip. Handle it like a boss and discuss it openly with a heavy heart. </p>



<p>Mercury’s backpedal starts with a conjunction to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Mars in Sagittarius</a> on November 12, setting the stage for an argument due to a confrontation over a misunderstanding. Mercury retrograde links up with Pluto in Aquarius on November 17, piling onto the issues from the 12th, a few days later. Matters can reach a fever pitch on the 17th, so tread lightly and don’t let conversations get too out of control. Mercury moves back into Scorpio on November 19, but moments after, Uranus retrograde in Taurus and Neptune retrograde in Pisces reveal secrets. The Sun forms a conjunction to Mercury retrograde on the 20th, a few hours before the New Moon. Saturn retrograde in Pisces and Jupiter retrograde in Cancer try to add structure to the vibe on November 22. However, we will break boundaries on the 24th when Venus and Mercury retrograde in Scorpio come together, forcing us to deal with situations and people from the old days. <br /><br />Yes, this Mercury retrograde is going to be tough. The best way to thrive is not to gaslight ourselves. Acknowledging our feelings and not compromising our needs could create conflict with those not ready to hear them. We shouldn’t hold back our sentiments to avoid drama and to make others happy. Speaking our truth and being as direct as possible during <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-aries-pisces-march-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrograde</a> is vital. We must clarify and simplify words several times to get our points across. IKYK miscommunications are rampant, so checking messages before sending for typos is essential. There could also be travel issues, so allotting ourselves an extra half hour to get to a destination helps lessen anxiety and stress. <br /><br />This Mercurial moonwalk is going to fuel our tempers and emotions. All of the watery planets are making us long for the past. Just because the moment has slipped away doesn’t mean the merit is gone. The universe is giving us another chance to mend fences, heal our hearts, and look back and right our wrongs or attempt to make good on former promises. The Mercurial reckoning is here — are you ready? </p>
