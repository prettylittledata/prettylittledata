<p><a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/cultural-heritage"">Architectural heritage</a> is often described as what survives time. Yet survival does not explain why certain buildings are preserved while others disappear. Many works now protected as cultural heritage were once criticized, contested, or openly rejected; they were accused of being socially misguided, materially flawed, or symbolically excessive. Over time, however, these same shortcomings have become central to their meaning as heritage emerges as a slow and unstable process of interpretation.</p>",

We mapped flows, removed steps, and optimized interactions — assuming the user would remain the primary actor.</p><p><strong>AI changes that assumption.</strong></p><p>Today, we find ourselves in a dangerous “messy middle.” We are building software that can act, decide, and synthesize, yet we are still designing it as if it were a simple tool. If we want to build products people actually love, we have to stop “sprinkling” AI onto our workflows. We have to answer one fundamental question:</p><blockquote><strong><em>Who holds the steering wheel at this specific moment, and what is the logic that justifies it?</em></strong></blockquote><p>We need a systematic way to move beyond “assistance everywhere.” We need to know when to step back and let the machine take the wheel entirely, and when to protect the human’s role as the accountable driver.</p><p>This article provides a practical framework that turns the “who does what” decision into a repeatable process.</p><h3>The Three Control Modes</h3><p>Every task maps to one of three modes. Each defines who acts, who decides, and what the interface must enforce.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Vsd0D1AVKLO4pKQLFeC6zA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>The Three Control Modes</figcaption></figure><h3>1) Human-Led</h3><p>The human retains full control. AI’s role is to surface evidence, highlight tradeoffs, and structure the decision — but never to act. The human reads, weighs, chooses, and executes.</p><p><strong>Design goal:</strong> Improve decision quality and accountability by giving the human clear evidence, tradeoffs, and structured rationale support.</p><p><strong>When to use it:</strong> High-stakes decisions requiring subjective judgment, empathy, or ethical nuance, or where the process itself creates value.</p><p><strong>Common UX patterns</strong></p><ul><li>Evidence packs (relevant facts, sources, prior cases, policies)</li><li>Tradeoff framing (pros/cons, risks, alternatives)</li><li>Structured decision templates (criteria + rationale capture)</li><li>“Second opinion” critique (counterarguments, failure modes)</li><li>Clear accountability cues (what is suggestion vs decision)</li></ul><h3>2) Assist</h3><p>AI does the heavy lifting — generating drafts, running calculations, scanning documents — but cannot commit consequential actions without explicit human approval. The human reviews, edits, and signs off.</p><p><strong>Design goal:</strong> Maximize speed and iteration while ensuring safe commitment through previews, diffs, and explicit human approval at key points.</p><p><strong>When to use it:</strong> High-variability tasks with medium-to-high stakes where errors are costly or hard to detect, and accountability must remain with a human</p><p><strong>Common UX patterns</strong></p><ul><li>Draft-first flows (generate → edit → approve)</li><li>Plan-before-execute (“here’s what I will do”)</li><li>Diff-based review (show changes, not just final output)</li><li>Provenance panels (inputs, sources, constraints used)</li><li>Uncertainty and “why” explanations (when/why the system is unsure)</li><li>Tight correction loops (edit a section, regenerate locally)</li><li>Clear commit controls (approve/apply with scope visibility)</li></ul><h3>3) Delegate</h3><p>AI owns the task. It acts autonomously within defined boundaries. Humans don’t approve individual actions — they set constraints upfront and review outcomes after the fact.</p><p><strong>Design goal:</strong> Run on autopilot with guardrails — minimize user involvement while keeping traceability, monitoring, and rollback when needed.</p><p><strong>When to use it:</strong> High-volume, low-stakes, predictable tasks with clear success criteria and easily detectable errors — where human review adds friction without adding value (e.g., data entry, spam filtering, meeting scheduling).</p><p><strong>Common UX patterns</strong></p><ul><li>Global constraints (allowlists, budgets, scopes, time windows)</li><li>Activity logs / timelines (what happened, when, and under which policy)</li><li>Monitoring by exception (alerts only on anomalies)</li><li>Rollback/undo where feasible (or compensating actions)</li><li>Audit views (sampling, QA workflows, policy compliance)</li></ul><h3>The Scoring Model</h3><p>Knowing the three modes isn’t enough. You need a systematic way to decide which mode fits which task. These variables determine whether a machine <em>should</em> act and whether it is <em>worth</em> the investment to make it do so.</p><figure><img alt=""UI-style scoring framework for automation decisions, showing sliders for Automation Suitability (reversibility, safety/risk, logic type) and Automation ROI (frequency, data readiness, AI proficiency) used to evaluate which tasks should be automated."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*awgQ8QXt7x6BynhMzD-HVw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>The Scoring Model Dimensions</figcaption></figure><h3>Dimension 1: Automation Suitability (S_SUIT)</h3><p>This measures <strong>risk and controllability</strong>. High score = safer to automate.</p><ul><li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> Can the action be undone? High reversibility allows for deeper delegation.</li><li><strong>Safety / Risk:</strong> What is the “blast radius” of a failure? Catastrophic risks require human-led guardrails.</li><li><strong>Logic Type:</strong> Is the task governed by objective rules (deterministic) or subjective “vibes” (probabilistic)?</li></ul><h3>Dimension 2: Automation ROI (S_ROI)</h3><p>This measures <strong>value and feasibility</strong>. High score = strong payoff for building automation.</p><ul><li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Is this a rare occurrence or a constant, high-volume workflow?</li><li><strong>Data Readiness:</strong> Is the necessary information messy and unstructured, or accessible via a structured API?</li><li><strong>AI Proficiency:</strong> Does the current model’s capability show experimental results or consistent mastery of the task?</li></ul><h3>Mapping Scores to Control Modes</h3><p>To move from raw scores to a functional product strategy, the framework uses a four-quadrant matrix to determine the optimal relationship between the user and the machine. By plotting <strong>Automation ROI</strong> on the X-axis against <strong>Automation Suitability</strong> on the Y-axis, you can categorize any workflow into one of four distinct strategic buckets.</p><ul><li><strong>Delegate (High ROI / High Suitability):</strong> The AI executes end-to-end within constraints while humans move to an auditor role. The goal is <strong>work removal</strong> through invisible execution and background guardrails.</li><li><strong>Assist (High ROI / Low Suitability):</strong> High-leverage tasks that are too risky for full autonomy. The AI drafts in steps, requiring a “human handshake” via previews and explicit approval at critical commits.</li><li><strong>Human-Led (Low ROI / Low Suitability):</strong> High-stakes or subjective tasks where human judgment is the primary value. The AI advises with evidence, but the human remains firmly at the steering wheel.</li><li><strong>Defer (Low ROI / High Suitability):</strong> Safe to automate, but the effort outweighs the gain. Keep these manual or use lightweight helpers until task frequency or AI proficiency shifts the ROI.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Example of an AI delegation matrix for interview scheduling, showing high automation suitability and ROI scores and placing the task in the “Delegate” quadrant of a human-led vs. AI-driven workflow grid."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bfyPhEzmtSk9s8NJrJE5sw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Example application of the AI Delegation Matrix: interview scheduling scores high on suitability and ROI, making it a strong candidate for full AI delegation with human oversight.</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s an example: <strong>interview scheduling coordination</strong>. <br />It’s frequent and time-consuming (high ROI), it’s mostly rules-based, low stakes, and easy to undo (high suitability).

These tasks require judgment that can’t be delegated — not because AI isn’t capable, but because accountability must remain with humans.</p><p><strong>(Assist):</strong> Content generation, insight detection, triage, and any task where AI can produce a strong first draft but the final call requires human review. Payment approvals and moderation decisions sit here too — AI flags and suggests, humans commit.</p><p><strong>(Delegate):</strong> Data operations dominate this range. ETL jobs, categorization, normalization, spam filtering, scheduling, notification routing. High volume, structured inputs, clear rules, easy rollback.</p><p>The scoring isn’t meant to be precise — it’s meant to force the conversation.

Images made with Midjourney.</blockquote><p>Maybe this text will become outdated as quickly as all the changes we’ve seen happening in our field over the last few years. But even if I run that risk, I feel I need to write a bit about a feeling I’ve seen spreading more and more among designers who work with digital products: <strong>the crisis of professional identity</strong>.</p><p>It’s no longer recent that Artificial Intelligence has been popularized with the rise of LLMs accessible to all audiences on a global scale. Even if it started with large models focused on text, in a short time we saw the exponential growth of countless tools that create a bit of everything.</p><p>When this started to become increasingly evident in our field, I began to notice that people started to understand again that a return to the generalist designer was happening in the digital product space. <strong>NN Group</strong> even published an article talking about the <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/return-ux-generalist/"">return of the UX Generalist</a> as a possible — and also desirable — role due to AI’s advance in delivering so many different parts of our process.</p><p><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/return-ux-generalist/"">The Return of the UX Generalist</a></p><p>At first, I interpreted that as positive — even while aware of the ethical and social implications of AI (which won’t be the subject of this text). However, looking more closely at the current landscape, what I’ve been noticing is that:</p><blockquote>the return to generality, with the help of the LLM models available now, doesn’t necessarily have a positive effect and can generate superficiality and a reduction in innovation in the long run.</blockquote><p>In this space, I’ll explain more about this feeling — especially for those who have been feeling anxiety about how AI may affect their professional and personal identity in today’s world.</p><p>This text is not against the use of AI: it’s simply an article with reflections on this current moment of interaction between designers and LLMs.</p><h3>Hyper-specialization as a pain</h3><figure><img alt=""Hyper-specialization and isolation. Midjourney, 2026."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*kPUwUssmnobbeDYk"" /><figcaption>Hyper-specialization and isolation. Midjourney, 2026.</figcaption></figure><p>In my master’s, one of the authors who helped me most in thinking about the way I liked to work was <a href=""https://www.psychaanalyse.com/pdf/EDGAR_MORIN_LES_7_SAVOIRS_A_L_EDUCATION_DU_FUTUR.pdf""><strong>Edgar Morin</strong></a>. He is a thinker who talks about how <strong>all modern knowledge</strong> (especially since the Renaissance revolution of scientific knowledge) <strong>has been guided by simplification through reductionist thinking</strong>. This reductionism pushes the individual from a broad basic education into higher education restricted to a single discipline, and then into progressively narrower specializations (until it’s expected they dedicate themselves to a single topic for the rest of their life).</p><p>I’ve always been averse to this kind of training, and I felt firsthand the effects of not following the expected path. It was only after many years that I realized doing that was very positive — especially seeing, in practice, this disjunction that Edgar Morin discusses so much in relation to twentieth-century education.</p><p>In these almost three decades that have passed in the twenty-first century, it’s possible to see that the field of digital product design specialized so much that it ended up opening internal fissures. I tend to see this as, at least, three major axes in which people specialize and navigate:</p><ol><li>a <strong>communicational axis</strong>, linked to branding, language, and art direction, where the artistic side of the interface matters a lot;</li><li>an <strong>empirical-scientific axis</strong>, linked to research, methods, data, validation, and decision-making — sometimes captured by ROI and return discourse, but not reducible to that; and</li><li>an <strong>exact and technical axis</strong>, tied to software engineering, where part of design remained close to front-end, components, systems, and implementation, as was already seen more strongly around 2010.</li></ol><p>Of course, this happened because of the size of the complexity of each major area — with only the digital product part relating to communication between humans and machines. But even if there’s a justification, what often happens is a production line between closed niches that don’t talk much to each other.</p><blockquote>Hyper-specialization leads to less communication, since each part understands only its own area and its own topic in depth, but can’t comprehend the issue that lives next door.</blockquote><p>And with that, information passes from area to area until it reaches the professionals at the end of the process: developers. I bet many of you have already witnessed this phenomenon, which creates noise around impediments or disagreements.</p><p>That’s why Morin talks so much about an <strong>education of the future</strong> in which complexity is embraced — in teaching that doesn’t funnel down but opens horizons — while maintaining depth of study. However, even if the <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/1061-7361(92)90024-8""><strong>Complexity Paradigm</strong></a> exists in the educational field (and I believe in it and defend it whenever I can), it’s important to be cautious!</p><p>The effects of having professionals who can embrace so many different areas have always been desired by many sectors of the market. That’s why the idea (even if often imaginary) of the “unicorn designer” has always been so promising — a caricature name given to the imagination of a “do-it-all”: someone who, alone, produces a super artistic and interactive interface with decisions grounded scientifically and empirically, and can still make the solution tangible in front-end.</p><p>The “but” in this always-desired idea is that it isn’t humanly possible to make a single professional transmogrify into roles that demand such different cognitive training — especially if you want a product that is truly good in each aspect.</p><p>But this collective imaginary never stopped existing, and it has now been reborn with the emergence and popularization of Artificial Intelligence. By relegating activities to the machine — even without specialized knowledge in a given area — it would be possible to stimulate the existence of this professional who navigates every corner and can deliver well in any activity.</p><p>It’s at this specific point that a promise is born — but also countless risks that are not yet fully predictable.</p><h3>Generalization as a risk</h3><figure><img alt=""Speed and chaos. Midjourney, 2026."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*5Z7JH1XqKcbrDedV"" /><figcaption>Speed and chaos. Midjourney, 2026.</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve been reflecting a lot on this issue. And more and more, I feel the problem isn’t the promise of the return of the generalist in itself: <strong>the problem is the way this may emerge within the scenario we have</strong>.</p><p>Look: unlike a reformed education in which people don’t isolate themselves into niches, what can happen is:</p><blockquote>a professional who keeps the same aptitudes as before, but starts delegating to the machine responsibilities they don’t really know how to develop.</blockquote><p>As the <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/return-ux-generalist/"">NN/G article</a> approaches this issue, the professional can get an <strong>AI boost</strong> — that is, manage to produce outputs in areas they didn’t master before. The output is produced, but the user’s cognition may remain the same as before.</p><p><em>Okay, but what’s the problem with that?</em></p><p>The issue here is that we’re operating primarily with <strong>Large Language Models</strong>, created specifically by companies that operate on a global level. These models learn human language (whether textual or imagistic) from enormous amounts of data to generate, through statistics and probability, responses that are coherent to us, humans. In more technical words, they function as <a href=""https://medium.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibm.com%2Fthink%2Ftopics%2Flarge-language-models"">token “prediction” machines</a>: given an input text (prompt), the model estimates what the most likely next token will be and uses that to build the output. I know each AI will have a more specific functioning (with image and video models), but in general, they all operate with statistics from the training specific to the company that created them.</p><p>That’s why AI today is not an intelligence in the human sense of the word: it’s a super complex machine that can learn countless patterns across all areas for which data is digitally available. That’s why it (at least not yet) doesn’t have what some have been calling <strong>neuro-symbolic reasoning</strong>.</p><p>A didactic example given by <a href=""https://www.edps.europa.eu/data-protection/technology-monitoring/techsonar/neuro-symbolic-artificial-intelligence_en"">Massimo Attoresi</a> is about reasoning in medicine: if a patient shows up with a rare symptom that has no report in previous studies, medical knowledge can be mobilized by a human to understand how to unravel that symptom. An LLM can’t do that: it can hallucinate and produce plausible answers or images, because its training prioritizes generating believable responses, even in the absence of sufficient knowledge to solve certain problems.</p><p>For most users, it’s more frustrating to receive an “I don’t know,” which is a questionable UX decision of these platforms. So when a designer who had a specialty starts producing any other specialty with LLMs, they will begin developing that only with the support of that machine that brings the probabilistic result most desired by the global average. And, even more importantly, that person will understand that their work is the output itself!</p><p>On the contrary, <strong>a professional identity is not defined only by what is delivered at the end, but by the cognitive and symbolic construction that allows one to cross complex processes </strong>— including those still unknown to the models or to humanity itself.</p><p>I’ve said so much here, and I wanted to add a parenthesis: yes, it’s possible to do a lot of design using LLMs today — in all instances of our work, including those we wouldn’t be able to do without AI due to training limitations. Now, it’s necessary to understand that when we train an agent to make the machine operate like a specialist in some part of the UX/UI process, we’re always generating probabilistic answers without a neuro-symbolic background to face new, unmapped situations.</p><p>And it’s exactly at this point that the risk lives. It’s a risk of homogenizing solutions, writing styles, innovation processes, visuals — and even code, in the case of massive reliance on LLMs. Unless the support comes from the professional identity path.</p><h3>The professional path as identity</h3><figure><img alt=""Professional and personal trajectory. Midjourney, 2026."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*-vNTMz5SGhCbVqbY"" /><figcaption>Professional and personal trajectory. Midjourney, 2026.</figcaption></figure><p>Think with me through an example:</p><blockquote>We have a designer who works with digital products and who has always, since very young, fit into a more communicational axis.</blockquote><blockquote>She spent years going deep to create highly visual platforms with unique animations that create an impact that many brands want.</blockquote><blockquote>She also grew by feeding on aesthetic sensitivity, managing to blend branding with product design very well in digital platforms.</blockquote><blockquote>In other words, everything she does visually is guided by the feeling built throughout that professional trajectory. And that feeling is based on concepts and methods studied for years, which <strong>allow</strong> her to get through very different problems without impediment.</blockquote><p>That person today may look at the current scenario and begin to feel anxiety and an identity crisis: “<em>Maybe my work won’t be valued anymore in some time because of AI.</em>” With that, she might start using different LLMs, trying to deliver in research areas (both qualitative and quantitative) and also to produce Design Systems, creating already-coded components.</p><p>What will probably happen in the long run if this person doesn’t start studying those fields instead of only creating outputs with AI? <strong>We lose a talent in one area to create a generalist who produces a bit of everything — but only through the LLM</strong>. And because it’s only with the help of that kind of tool, her deliveries will tend to fit the globally expected statistical average.</p><p>Now, what happens if that same person starts using AI to deepen her work, but also to experiment with adjacent areas in order to learn how they work? It’s at this point that I think we gain more from the use of LLMs today.</p><p>Beyond automating manual and exhausting tasks, the AI boost can be applied to our training, enabling dialogues and cooperation with peers that used to be very difficult. And, returning to our dear Edgar Morin, collective thinking becomes more complex because, even though each person maintains their specialization, everyone can understand or do the basics of their teammates’ work — even if with less depth.</p><p>I think this is a very subtle difference, but fundamental for understanding the difference between production and innovation in the twenty-first century.</p><p>Want to talk more about this?<br /> Send me a message on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/matheuscervo/"">LinkedIn</a>.</p><h3>References</h3><p>GIBBONS, Sarah; SUNWALL, Evan.

<h4><strong><em>Designing how models behave.</em></strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a ux team working together building AI products using data, context and evals"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*K1TUKUFPN-K327z9HhexYg.png"" /><figcaption>UX team using their new toolkit (Ilustration from Nothing Fancy)</figcaption></figure><p>We have entered a world where the experience is generated in the moment, and users react to it. The days when products rendered code that produced exactly what we designed are numbered. When someone uses an AI product, they are responding to behavior unfolding in real time, shaped by probabilistic systems rather than fixed screens. This marks a break from the era where designers could predict and control every outcome, and it forces UX to confront a new kind of material.</p><p>AI products are defined by non-deterministic behavior. The experience is something that unfolds on the fly, produced by AI models. What users see, read, hear, or are guided through is the result of systems making decisions on their behalf. Yet much of the current focus in UX and AI remains on production speed. Faster prototyping. Vibe coding. These practices matter, but they stop short of addressing the real shift AI introduces.</p><p>The real transformation of our craft lies in designing how the model behaves.</p><p>Engineering, and now Product, have moved upstream. They shape models, constrain outputs, define system behavior, and determine what is possible or impossible. UX often treats the model as a black box and designs around it. The result is AI products that may appear user-centered, but are often misaligned with the user intent and, at times, harmful.</p><h4><strong>How it works today</strong></h4><p>In many organizations, engineering and product teams are already designing the core of the experience. Not through screens, but through system prompts, fine-tuning strategies, tool definitions, orchestration logic, and evaluation frameworks. They are using an AI product Flywheel, and iterating constantly. UX is often brought in downstream to make the output feel nicer, more on-brand. That is not where the real leverage is.</p><p>During a talk last summer, <a href=""https://www.andrewng.org/"">Andrew Ng</a> argued that the real bottleneck is no longer engineering, but product. As AI accelerates code production, the hard part becomes deciding what to build. His advice was for PMs to talk to users, develop empathy, create mental models of the users they are serving.</p><p>UX was notably absent from this framing, which says a lot about how poorly our discipline has articulated its value. The proposal is for product management to take on a larger role relative to engineering, even changing the ratio. His example shifts from one PM to four engineers, to one PM to half an engineer. As this space opens up for product, it should open to designers as well, with comparable influence. After all, understanding users, framing problems, and deciding why we build things have always been core to UX.</p><figure><img alt=""Andrew Ng speaking at the Y combinator event.

Y Combinator.</em></figcaption></figure><h4><strong>A necessary mental shift for designers</strong></h4><p>For designers, this is a new space to conquer; it requires a mental shift away from deterministic systems and toward behavioral design. This does not mean abandoning user-centered design, it means applying it where it matters most. Models are not magic, they are material that can be designed.</p><p><em>“In the pre-software age the only thing designers had to worry about was how a product was built. But in the post-software era we have to think about how the products will behave. That’s a new paradigm and many people are still stuck in the pre-software era when it comes to design…” — </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ovettasampson/""><strong><em>Ovetta Sampson</em></strong></a><strong><em> and </em></strong><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/timbrownatlindkedin/""><strong><em>Tim Brown</em></strong></a><strong><em> (99U 2019)</em></strong></p><p>For us to enter this space, we need to get educated. Not to become AI engineers, but to understand how behavior emerges from systems. That means asking about training data, shaping the context a model processes, and contributing to evaluation strategies that define what is acceptable and what is not.</p><p>Some companies are already ahead of the curve. They employ <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-rise-of-the-model-designer-cef429d9c134"">Model Designers </a>whose work focuses explicitly on shaping model behavior. This is a reality at companies like OpenAI, Google and <a href=""https://www.aidesignfieldguide.com/articles/barron-webster"">Figma</a>, but it should not be treated as an exception. Every organization building AI products needs this capability within its design practice, whether as a dedicated role or as a core skill embedded in existing design roles.</p><h4><strong>The new toolkit: Data, context, and evals</strong></h4><p>When AI models <a href=""https://youtube.com/shorts/fSy3MNG0QIQ?si=rpXVTcKgAv24THyY"">are the material</a>, then data, context, and evals are the tools we need to shape it. Let’s get familiar with your new tools.</p><figure><img alt=""A flywheel with 3 components: data, context and evals"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/860/1*RMWX4Vl_Q7XXTPaWxKpamQ.png"" /><figcaption>AI Flywheel</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Data shapes what a model knows and what it predicts.</strong> Pretraining data, fine-tuning data, and data generated during interaction shape what will be generated, and no data is created equally. Designers should be asking what kinds of behavior this data encourages, what perspectives it excludes, and also how it was acquired.</p><p>We are immersed in a world of large multimodal models, where much of the data has been scraped from the internet, often taken from authors without consent, and filled with biases and unfair patterns. As designers, we also must question whether this is the path we want to take, or whether smaller, more ethical models are the better choice.</p><p><strong>Context shapes what a model can consider in the moment.</strong> This includes user input, environmental signals, retrieved knowledge, system prompts, safeguards, and instructions. The context window is where most of the experience is assembled. Writing system prompts, instructions, and constraints is design work. It is mostly done using plain, simple language with XLM markups, and of course AI can help designers with this process.</p><p>Lately, we have witnessed AI models generate adult content, sometimes involving minors, often without consent from the real people in the images. We have seen models suggest harmful acts during conversations, in some heartbreaking cases resulting in death. Choosing not to implement strong safeguards, or deciding not to block or redirect certain conversations, is also a design decision. With technology this powerful, designers must be truly intentional about defining what systems should not do.</p><p><strong>Evals determine what success means.</strong> What is acceptable. What is unsafe. What must never happen. Deciding what to measure is deciding what matters. It is highly influential, and for most AI companies evaluations have become the moat. Without evals, we cannot know what is failing or how broken a system really is.</p><p>This becomes especially critical when working with large pre-trained models (such as GPT or Gemini). These models are continuously updated, and engineering teams will change them over time. How do you know whether a new version performs better for your product than the previous one. How can you recover quickly knowing that the user will be ok. This is where evaluations come in.</p><p>A good place to start is with frameworks. These are highly use-case dependent and often form part of a company’s secret sauce. One framework I find useful is RISK. Relevant, Inclusive, Safe, and Kind. We want to measure if and how often the output is relevant, whether it is a generated interface or a response.</p><p>Strong evaluation strategies also mix different types of evaluators:</p><p><strong>1/Human evaluations</strong> involve manually reviewing outputs. They are necessary, but expensive and slow.</p><p><strong>2/Automated evaluators </strong>complement human judgment.</p><ul><li>Code-based evaluators are deterministic tools that apply explicit, predefined logic.</li><li>LLM as Judge evaluators use language models to assess quality along dimensions that are difficult to encode in traditional code.</li></ul><p>Once we have evaluations in place, we can start to measure results and decide how to act on them to improve the product. This might include adding new data sets for fine-tuning, grounding responses by connecting to a knowledge base, revising context through system prompt changes, or even introducing antagonistic models. We work with data, context, and evaluations in a continuous AI flywheel of improvement.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a team working together"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/872/1*4688kvNZnkYsn4PgdL5XkQ.png"" /><figcaption>Let’s join engineering and product</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Agentic design and systemic thinking</strong></h4><p>Agentic design is not about a single model responding to a user. It is about ecosystems of specialized AI agents, each with its own instructions, memory, tools, and goals. They coordinate, hand off tasks, make decisions, and act over time.</p><p>Designing this requires systemic thinking. Designers must understand how agents work, how they delegate, how failures propagate, and how users control these workflows.</p><p>There are many definitions of agents today. But at their core, they are AI models and rely on the same design materials. Your new toolkit: Data, context, evals.</p><h4><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h4><p>We might not need AI at all.</p><p>Before jumping into the hype, technology should not be the thing driving the solution. Many problems can and should be solved with simpler systems. When AI is truly needed, smaller or more specialized models are often better than massive multimodal ones for everyday goals. They are easier to shape, easier to evaluate, and less risky for users. If an organization chooses to build on large, popular multimodal models, then being a critical participant in shaping behavior becomes non-negotiable.</p><p>Engineering looks after the technology. Product looks after the business. The user, however, is alone without us.</p><p>This is where UX must step in. Designers need to move upstream, working alongside engineering and product to shape AI products end-to-end.</p><p>Go and learn your new tools.</p><p><em>Note: If this resonates and you want to build these skills with your team, I offer the Model Designer workshop.

<h4>The one with React, Tailwind and the separation of concerns</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kZN4DxRu31nQssMHRuFCTg.png"" /></figure><p>When I started learning about web development I learned clean HTML, vanilla JavaScript and pure CSS, which are three different ways of saying: “No Frameworks”.</p><p>That’s the way most developers learned to code, at least in my age group, since we didn’t have any framework other than jQuery back then, and AI coding assistants weren’t a thing yet.</p><p>Years later I did learn React (a JavaScript framework) and I did had to get to know Tailwind (a CSS framework) for work projects so everyone in the development team would be on the same page.</p><p>For years I didn’t understand why React or Tailwind worked in the way they did, I felt frustrated because every little thing seemed to require more work then in plain JavaScript or CSS.</p><p>I didn’t think those frameworks save me much time or work in the long run and I was annoyed that I had to use them every day.</p><p>When I asked other developers about that, they often cited the concept of “separation of concerns” as a reason that makes React simpler to use or more suitable for team projects.</p><p>At the time I didn’t get it. But now — after years of working with React and Tailwind I think I’m finally getting it. If you’re anything like I was, confused or frustrated about it, please keep reading.</p><h3>What is separation of concerns</h3><p>Separation of concerns is a programming term that means that any “problem” can be separated into smaller and easier to deal with “concerns”.</p><p>In our example the “concerns” are just long code that is hard to grasp all at once. HTML has a few ways of dealing with code that is too complex already built-in to the technology.</p><p>One way we can handle code that’s too long is to separate it into different files — HTML for the content, CSS for the styles and JavaScript (js files) for functions.</p><p>This way you can more easily separate the different areas you’re dealing with: HTML for the structure, CSS when you handle the design and JavaScript when you handle the hardcore programming stuff.</p><figure><img alt=""The big 3 file types: HTML, CSS and JS."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0KoD-Ccdg_1Qg2R3p4b1qA.png"" /><figcaption>The big 3 file types: HTML, CSS and JS.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course in real projects every file will be in multiples, multiple HTML files for different pages (or parts of pages), multiple CSS files for different aspects of the design and multiple JavaScript files for different kinds of functions.</p><p>As the project goes up in complexity the pile of files gets bigger and it is murky at best where is the line to split the files.</p><p>If we’ll take for example CSS files, as it is closest to the design aspect and so easier to explain, we have multiple options how to slice it:</p><ol><li>Maybe just to work with one huge file</li><li>Slicing it to smaller files by platform: Desktop.css, Mobile.css etc.</li><li>Slicing it by components: Header.css, Footer.css, Button.css etc.</li><li>Slicing it by pages: Index.css, About.css, Contact.css … General.css</li><li>Slicing it by function: Common.css, Breakpoints.css, Vars.css etc.</li></ol><p>It isn’t clear at all where to draw the line of separation and I’ve seen many teams do it in very different ways, sometimes even combining more than one option unintentionally.</p><p>So how can React and Tailwind help us to decide?</p><h3>The component based approach</h3><p>Let me preface what I’m about to say with that, like HTML, there’s lots of ways of making a React app.</p><p>The most common way is to separate each component into its own file, so we’ll end up with files named Button.jsx, Checkbox.jsx, Avatar.jsx, Card.jsx etc.</p><p>These components get imported into different screens with different configurations (via props) so the code inside the components will potentially get replicated an infinite amount of times.</p><p>Unlike HTML, we don’t need to manually copy the code to different places and different files, we just import the component and React will swap its code into every place we’ve called it from.</p><p>If we’re thinking about the separation of concerns, what React does is very different from HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript .</p><figure><img alt=""React common files structure, notice how every component has a complimentary CSS file"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/812/1*7qEbNSNibMNpTJg7SqU1PA.png"" /><figcaption>React common files structure, notice how every component has a complimentary CSS file</figcaption></figure><p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript separate our concerns into multiple areas of responsibility, while React takes a different approach.</p><p>React separates our concerns based on component structure, so different developers can work on different components without bumping into one another.</p><p>But they’re all React developers, no longer a CSS specialist or an HTML architect, everyone is doing the same kind of work but on different building blocks.</p><p>The distinction here is major since it slices the work for optimization rather than for specialization, which is almost the opposite approach.</p><h3>Entering Tailwind CSS</h3><p>Tailwind is a very popular CSS framework that works as a utility framework meaning all styles are done with inline classes instead of a big giant stylesheet.</p><p>This way you can copy and paste components from different layouts and ensure they will look exactly the same, of course when working with React components, the component gets imported into many layouts, pages or screens so consistency is key — and Tailwind enables just that.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*huR5zgz0VL57FIMgfHXKlA.png"" /><figcaption>The same button 3 times (left to right): Pure HTML/CSS, Tailwind, rendered result.</figcaption></figure><p>If this is your first time seeing Tailwind code, I implore you to go and try it out, it’s not as strange to work with as it might seem at first glance and it is much better than making inline styles.</p><p>Now that every codebase is in some degree written with AI I can’t stress this enough — Tailwind is much better than regular inline styles, if you’re a CSS purist working with a stylesheet file or files that’s great, even a simple inline style here and there is mostly fine.</p><p>But never let the AI just make lots and lots of inline styles for everything, always ask to convert them to another file or just to work with Tailwind, inline styles are unmaintainable in the long run.</p><p>I know what you must be thinking when encountering Tailwind, and it’s the title of the next section.</p><figure><img alt=""Now we don’t have any CSS files, every component is just one file (tsx, jsx or js file)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/850/1*ps_lonYDcBT14XsvgL6TVw.png"" /><figcaption>When working with Tailwind we don’t need any CSS files, every component is just one file (tsx or jsx file)</figcaption></figure><h3>What happened to separation of concerns?</h3><p>I know that at first it looks like our separation of concerns is gone, React already implements all the HTML (via JSX) and the JavaScript in the same files.</p><p>Tailwind CSS takes it even further and it pulls the CSS utility classes into the JSX as well, instead of leaving them on separate files.</p><p>That way we don’t get any separation by areas anymore, the functions, design and structure all live together.</p><p>What we DO get, however, is separation by component, which can be more useful for big teams who work on the same system or same project together.</p><p>Separation by component means that even though a developer might be working on all the different areas of an Avatar component, the same developer doesn’t need to be concerned about the Button component while doing it.</p><p>Tailwind CSS ensures that all components will be designed as planned, even if they were designed in isolation, outside the system itself, since its utility classes are all deterministic by design and no style should ever leak outside its intended scope.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Separation of concerns is subjective and it is done differently in different systems, React and Tailwind do it component-based while pure HTML and CSS are more area-based.</p><p>There is no right answer to how you should do it, but consistency is key, especially when working in a team.</p><p>Guidelines and best practices are great, but a separation that is inherit to the technology itself will always be better since everyone in the team can agree on it.</p><p>When we consider a separation of concerns based on areas of expertise we can also consider to hire a CSS specialist, for example, but a Button specialist is not currently a job title, and maybe it should be as React and Tailwind becomes more popular.</p><p>I didn’t touch on all the ways to separate CSS into multiple files and achieve something similar to component-based separation of concerns in pure HTML and CSS because I don’t believe it’s the right way to go when working in large teams.</p><p>There are a million technologies out there and a million ways to solve this issue, but I picked React and Tailwind as an example since it’s a very popular solution.</p><p>This article only scratched the surface.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed it, thanks

<h4>What we can learn from Linear about trusting judgement without ignoring evidence</h4><figure><img alt=""Migrating flock of birds, silhoutte on a sunset sky."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*nUcS3dsfo9Mw2Xgu"" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=""https://unsplash.com/@the_ova?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Vitaly Otinov</a> on <a href=""https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Data feels objective, defensible, and safe. In many product teams, it has quietly become the most powerful decision-maker in the room — not because it consistently leads to better outcomes, but because it removes personal accountability. When a decision can be justified with numbers, no one has to truly own it.</p><blockquote>“Although you may think that people instinctively want to make the best possible decision, there is a stronger force that animates business decision-making: the desire not to get blamed or fired.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Rory Sutherland</blockquote><p>‘Data-driven design’ is often framed as maturity. In practice, it can become a way to defer judgement, smooth over disagreement, and default to the option that will attract the least resistance. The result isn’t better products — it’s safer ones. Incremental improvements which optimise what already exists, while bolder ideas are quietly filtered out because they can’t yet be proven.</p><p>The uncomfortable truth is that data doesn’t make decisions, people do. Data can inform, challenge, and validate — but it can’t decide what <em>should</em> exist, only describe what <em>has</em> happened before. When teams hide behind metrics, they’re not being rigorous; they’re avoiding the risk that comes with choosing a direction and standing behind it.</p><blockquote>“It’s important to remember that big data all comes from the same place — the past.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Rory Sutherland</blockquote><h3>How Linear balances judgement and evidence</h3><p>In an interview reflecting on Linear’s design philosophy, co-founder and designer Karri Saarinen speaks directly about the limits of “<a href=""https://youtu.be/4muxFVZ4XfM?si=wTvMaV6-txFSlIa4"">hiding behind data</a>” and the harder work of judgement. <a href=""https://x.com/karrisaarinen/status/1706745692965027994"">He describes how teams often lean on quantitative signals because they’re afraid of making the wrong choice — and how data becomes a comforting shield.</a> But that safety is an illusion. Data doesn’t make choices for you; it only reports what has already happened.</p><p>Too much deference to metrics doesn’t just slow teams down — it actively pushes them toward incrementalism. When evidence is treated as a prerequisite for action rather than an input into judgement, bold ideas struggle to survive long enough to be tested.</p><p>What’s striking in Saarinen’s thinking is his insistence that product teams should feel empowered to decide based on a deep understanding of the problem, and rich context gained from direct engagement with users and the product — not just dashboards or scoreboard metrics.</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of the Linear product management platform, showing the sleek, clean interface."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*acTrxuSLfk04FWlNXWH6Jg.avif"" /><figcaption><em>Linear is a product development tool built with an unusually strong emphasis on craft, clarity, and focus — designed by people who believe good software should feel deliberate.</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://linear.app/now/why-is-quality-so-rare"">At Linear, design isn’t something you outsource to analytics — it’s a product philosophy.</a> They pursue quality not as a growth tactic or a differentiator, but because they believe good software should be well made. Craft isn’t justified by metrics; it’s a responsibility the team chooses to take seriously.</p><p><a href=""https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-linear-builds-product"">Rather than waiting for perfect metrics before acting, Linear routinely builds features and ships them to internal users or small opt-in groups early — even when the experience is rough.</a> This accelerates learning, sharpens judgement, and creates real feedback long before broad exposure. Engineers and designers are encouraged to own problems end-to-end, including small inefficiencies that may not yet register in analytics, but materially affect the lived experience of users.</p><h4>Data is a tool, not a crutch</h4><p>Saarinen points out that teams often invoke data when they’re afraid to own a decision. At Linear, they don’t rely on exhaustive ranking exercises or metric-driven roadmaps to determine direction. Instead, decisions emerge from a blend of:</p><ul><li>Direct customer conversations and qualitative feedback</li><li>Founders’ and team intuition, shaped by deep product familiarity</li><li>Contextual signals from real usage</li></ul><p>Data is still present, but it becomes one signal in a broader conversation, not the authority that ends it.</p><blockquote>“Data isn’t bad — it’s just not the decision-maker.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Karri Saarinen</blockquote><h4>Build with confidence, fail fast, and fix things</h4><p>Linear treats mistakes as an expected part of building good products. This flips the narrative from fear to responsibility. Designers and product leads aren’t protected by metrics; they’re accountable for choices — and expected to correct them quickly when they’re wrong.</p><blockquote><em>“Sometimes we make the wrong choice, and then we just fix it — but at least </em>we<em> made the choice, and the data didn’t make the choice for us.”</em></blockquote><blockquote>— Karri Saarinen</blockquote><h4>Safe decisions are rarely transformative</h4><p>Safe decisions are rarely transformative — and transformative decisions are rarely safe. Direction at Linear is chosen through judgement informed by deep engagement with users, even when the metrics haven’t caught up yet.</p><p>By combining context, craft, judgement, and fast feedback loops, teams can avoid both extremes: blind intuition on one side, and the paralysis of waiting for perfect data on the other.</p><h3>What we can learn from Linear</h3><h4><strong>Ship early and often</strong></h4><p>Don’t wait for perfect analytics before releasing. Internal launches and small cohorts create faster, richer learning than prolonged analysis ever will.</p><h4>Build shared product understanding</h4><p>Distribute customer stories, recordings, and qualitative insights. When context is shared, judgement becomes defensible without needing a dashboard to prove every choice.</p><h4>Treat data as input, not authority</h4><p>Use metrics to inform and challenge intuition, not replace it. Data should contribute to decisions — not make them by default.</p><h4>Give designers space to pursue craft</h4><p>Quality isn’t always measurable upfront, but it’s immediately felt. When teams prioritise craft, they make better decisions because they’re deeply attuned to user experience.</p><h4>Close the accountability loop</h4><p>Make decisions based on expertise and judgement — then measure the outcome. Celebrate learning, not just success. That’s how intuition becomes a skill, not a superstition.</p><h3>References and resources</h3><h4><a href=""https://youtu.be/4muxFVZ4XfM?si=nIj236gra4EU8b7c"">Inside Linear: Building with taste, craft, and focus</a></h4><p>The main inspiration for this article was an interview with Karri Saarinen on design judgement, data, and decision-making — particularly from around 49m, where he critiques hiding behind data and emphasises ownership of decisions.</p><ul><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/if-youre-not-using-ux-data-it-s-not-ux-design-9e02c388d196"">If you're not using UX data, it's not UX design</a></li><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-onboarding-linear-built-without-any-ab-testing-b035572ced72"">The onboarding Linear built without any AB Testing</a></li><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/a-b-testing-done-wrong-87beee4a5328"">A/B testing done wrong</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a07360337dd8"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-safest-decision-is-rarely-the-right-one-a07360337dd8"">The safest decision is rarely the right one</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<p>Ahead, get up close and personal with Charlotte Tilbury’s new <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fcharlotte-tilbury-airbrush-flawless-blur-concealer-P520870%3FskuId%3D2941888"">Airbrush Flawless Blur Concealer</a>, and see how it looks on us. </p>



<h2><strong>What is Charlotte Tilbury’s Airbrush Flawless Blur Concealer, and what are the benefits?  </strong></h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/charlotte-tilbury-airbrush-flawless-blur-concealer-P520870?skuId=2941888"">Airbrush Flawless Blur Concealer</a> is billed as a full-coverage concealer with a soft-matte finish. (In comparison, Charlotte Tilbury’s Beautiful Skin Radiant Concealer has buildable, medium coverage.) In addition to claims of up to 24 hours of creaseless wear, it’s infused with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid and squalane. And let’s talk about the wand, because this isn’t your typical doe-foot applicator; it’s got a unique, diamond-like shape that allows it to get into precise spots (like around the eyes) but large enough to quickly dot all over in place of foundation. </p>

<p>Unlike some of our other favorite concealers from the brand (take <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charlotte-tilbury-beautiful-skin-concealer-review"">Beautiful Skin</a>, for example, which has a creamy texture and natural coverage), <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/charlotte-tilbury-airbrush-flawless-blur-concealer-P520870?skuId=2941888"">Airbrush Flawless Blur</a> lends a full-coverage, “filter-like” finish to the skin to minimize texture and imperfections. I have oily, acne-prone skin, and the matte finish (a rarity these days, in a sea of dewy, radiant products) makes my complexion look as smooth as a Vermeer portrait. “The coverage is incredible, which means you really only need a pin prick to tuck away breakouts, dark circles, or hyperpigmentation — any more than that accentuates my fine lines and dry patches,” adds Refinery29’s beauty director Jacqueline Kilikita.  </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957756.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>But don’t just take our word for it. “It didn’t feel heavy at all,” agreed Refinery29’s production and editorial coordinator Dawnie Jefferson. “It blended really easily, which is usually my issue with concealer. I also loved the soft matte finish, which looked great in photos.” </p>

<h2><strong>How do you use Charlotte Tilbury’s Airbrush Flawless Blur Concealer, and is it worth it? </strong></h2>



<p>Unlike other concealers that are lighter in coverage (and therefore more forgiving), <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/charlotte-tilbury-airbrush-flawless-blur-concealer-P520870?skuId=2941888"">Airbrush Flawless Blur</a> is dependent on correct application. Both myself and Jackie were overenthusiastic the first time, only to realize that less is more with this formula. “I made the mistake of applying big swipes under my eyes (old habits die hard) and struggled to make it look natural,” she says. “The fact that so little goes a long way is actually a bonus — concealer is expensive, and it’s my most-used product, so this one is excellent value.” </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957783.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Since this is a matte, full-coverage formula, I lean into skin prep in order to create a hydrated, radiant base that will provide a comfortable canvas for makeup. Instead of my everyday technique of dotting concealer in place of foundation and blending, I ended up strategically placing tiny dots only where needed and buffing it out with my <a href=""https://roseandbenbeauty.com/products/de-buffing-concealer-complexion-brush"">Rose &amp; Ben D2 complexion brush</a>. In my experience, this delivers the natural coverage I typically prefer, while still evening out hyperpigmentation and breakouts. </p>



<p>The overall effect isn’t mask-like. Instead, it tucks away dark circles, breakouts, and hyperpigmentation in a way that doesn’t erase features. My skin still looks like skin.  </p>



<h2><strong>Final Thoughts </strong></h2>



<p>When Charlotte says “blur,” this truly does the job. As an oily, acne-prone girl, I personally love the diffused, matte finish, which I found made additional setting powder optional. (I do like a setting mist for added insurance, though.) Jackie agrees, adding that the coverage “really is second to none.” </p>

<p><em>This Money Diary was written in the summer of 2025. </em></p>



<p><strong>Editor’s note: After a short hiatus, we’re back once a week! Thank you for your patience. We’ll be honoring Money Diary submissions we received during our break by publishing them in the coming weeks. There’s more to come soon — stay tuned.</strong> </p>



<p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Senior director<br /><strong>Industry:</strong> Healthcare<br /><strong>Age:</strong> 37<br /><strong>Location:</strong> South Central Oregon<br /><strong>Salary:</strong> $220,000<br /><strong>Joint Income/Financial Setup:</strong> I’m recently divorced. I have the ability to bonus up to 20% annually as well. I’m not banking on that this year because it hinges on the profit margin for the hospital, and hospitals aren’t doing great right now.<br /><strong>Assets:</strong> $65,815 in checking/savings (the majority is in a high yield savings account), $190,615 in investments/retirement accounts, house valued at $482,000, and SUV valued at $22,589. I spent my savings considerably over the last few months on a downpayment for my house and a kitchen/bath remodel. I still have one more check to fork over for the remodel and then I will be focused on building my savings back up. I keep a balance of $5,000 in my checking, $5,000 in a savings account at the same bank, and roll everything surplus into a high yield savings at an online bank. I keep $30,000 in an emergency fund and let the rest go towards whatever pops up. I like to have a good financial cushion, and it feels even more important now that I am on my own. I saved aggressively over the last few years to be able to comfortably exit a very bad marriage. My current job was a huge pay increase for me and required me to move away from my now-ex giving me a very fortunate exit pathway (thanks universe!).<br /><strong>Debt:</strong> $411,913.38 on my mortgage.<br /><strong>Paycheck Amount (Biweekly):</strong> $4,677.82<br /><strong>Pronouns:</strong> She/Her</p>



<p><strong>Monthly Expenses</strong><br /><br /><strong>Monthly Housing Costs:</strong><br /><strong>Mortgage:</strong> $2,988.27. I recently purchased an ADORABLE 1940s colonial in my favorite neighborhood. It’s way too much house for me with four bedrooms and three bathrooms, but I fell in love with it. I had to upgrade the electrics and decided to sink the majority of my savings into a remodel of the kitchen (it was terrible), and the main floor bathroom, too. According to my expense tracking spreadsheet, the remodel will cost approx $85k. <strong>Monthly Loan Payments:</strong> $0. My car is paid off, and I didn’t have any student loans.<br /><strong>All Other Monthly Plan Expenses: </strong><br /><strong>Cell phone: </strong>$104<br /><strong>Streaming services:</strong> $68 <br /><strong>Utilities: </strong>$250<br /><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> $72.45 (AppleCare, Apple Music, ChatGPT, NYT and iCloud). <br /><br /><strong>Other: </strong><br /><strong>Beauty treatments:</strong> I spend around $400 every 12 weeks on botox, and $45 at a similar interval to get my hair cut. I don’t have the patience for getting my hair colored or maintaining my nails. (I did recently have someone compliment my highlights which are definitely grey hair.)<br /><strong>Savings: </strong>I receive a monthly stipend from the VA [Veterans Affairs] of $774.16 that goes directly into my savings. I pay off my credit cards every paycheck, and roll what’s left above the $5k I keep in my checking and savings at my brick and mortar bank into a high yield savings account. </p>



<p><strong>Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?</strong><br />It was never expressly stated, but both of my parents went to college and it was assumed my brother and I would as well. I went to a state school for my undergrad, and an online state school for my Master’s degree. There were some detours in the bachelors process because I was a wild ass and partied way to much, nearly got kicked out, and then used the military to straighten myself out after my freshman year. I went back to school post deployment to finish my bachelors. I did have a college fund that my grandparents set up for me with around $20,000 in it. I spent it mostly on a car or to pay off credit cards when I overspent. It dwindled over time. I still have some of it in an investment account though. I had a scholarship in undergrad that covered books, and used a combo of tuition assistance through the national guard and my GI bill benefit to cover both my bachelors and Master’s degree.<br /><br /><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?</strong><br />Money was openly discussed, partially because it was pretty tight when I was little. My dad was a cop and my mom is a medical technician and they were both early shift workers. They would pick up extra shifts when we needed to make ends meet. The core lesson was to not spend what you don’t have — my family has a very conservative view on debt which I have carried into adulthood. My grandfather also liked to educate my brother and I on finances by encouraging us to think about retirement early on in our lives, and to understand the value of investing and money growing over time. My brother is the better saver out of us, but after a few overspending situations when I was young I figured it out. I would say I’m the least fiscally conservative of my family. I pay for nice vacations and was willing to use my savings on a renovation — my brother thinks I am insane for it but it is within my means.<br /><br /><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?</strong><br />My first job was selling wild game summer sausage and hot sauce to tourists in a VERY niche retail store. I got that job the week I turned 16 and had transportation to reliably get to and from work. I was expected to earn my own spending money and babysitting gigs weren’t that lucrative. I traded up to selling rodeo tickets a few weeks later and worked in a cowboy hat shop on weekends during the school year for spending money. I have always had a job or been actively job hunting since then (I had a really miserable time finding a job after moving with my now-ex to New Mexico).<br /><br /><strong>Did you worry about money growing up?</strong><br />Yes, I knew we were living paycheck to paycheck a lot of the time. However, that being said, my parents actively saved for retirement and we probably could have been a bit more comfortable if they were less responsible about that. We largely ate elk instead of store bought meat — it was considerably better financially to get an elk every autumn and live off of that than try and purchase meat from the grocery store. I thought beef was a total luxury. I did dance lessons and was acutely aware that extra on-call shifts paid for it. Around the time I was going into high school, my dad became the undersheriff and my mom was promoted into management, so money became less of a worry. My friends were definitely better off than I was but it was less acute.<br /><br /><strong>Do you worry about money now?</strong><br />Yes. This year, I got a divorce and I let my ex-husband keep the house (which had about $200k in equity), a car, and gave up my rights to his pension and military retirement. So, I had to reevaluate my financial position (Life advice: don’t roll over in the divorce process like I did, but trauma can make you do dumb things). Luckily, I had saved very well to be able to walk away and my current job was a $70k pay increase. I feel a bit behind in retirement savings but I try to keep in mind that this income level is really fresh. Before I finished grad school I was making around $32k a year and have seen my income climb quite a bit over the last seven-ish years. My financial planner has assured me I’m fine, but I really want to rebuild my savings and continue to save aggressively for retirement.<br /><br /><strong>At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?</strong><br />I became financially responsible at 18, minus health insurance and my cell phone. I was on my parents’ insurance off and on until I aged out, and they paid for my phone until I met my ex-husband and got on his phone plan. I do know that I could fall back on my parents for help if I needed to, but I never want to need to ask for that. They did inherit, what is to our family a lot of money, last year when my grandmother passed away and would be able to help me out (thanks great grandparents for saving up a small nest egg!)<br /><br /><strong>Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.</strong><br />I receive a passive $774 monthly from the VA, and as of this year get an annual check for whatever the IRS gifting limit is. This year was $38,000 — basically the only reason I was able to buy the house and finance the remodel in the same year. My grandparents sat on the money while we struggled and my parents have decided to gift it away annually so my brother and I have it while we are young(ish). I’m going to put it into the house throughout 2027, and then my financial planner is going to do whatever he does with it, and eventually my brother’s kids will inherit it or I will be the ‘cool gift money aunt’ so they put me in one of the nice care homes.</p>

<h3>Day One: Saturday</h3>



<p>6:30 a.m. — I slept in until 6:30 a.m., got up and then fed my dog, C. Then I made coffee and ate half a bagel with strawberry cream cheese. Carbs are a new luxury in my life, as of last May, when I moved here and stopped having to do whatever fad diet my ex-husband was insisting on. The bagels still feel like a rebellion. I don’t eat much for breakfast, breakfast is also somewhat new, because intermittent fasting was part of the pre-freedom regimen. I also have a glass of water with creatine — another new thing I’m trying.</p>



<p>1:00 p.m. — I’ve been cleaning the house all morning and I’m starving, so I make a big ass Caesar salad for lunch with romaine lettuce, parm, croutons, and pine nuts with BRIANNAS dressing. I have been living through a remodel since mid-June and the kitchen is mostly done, so I’m aggressively tackling the construction dust. I’m also anxious to have the house in good condition because a man I have been talking to is driving 2.5 hours today to have a first date with me, and somehow we both think it is reasonable for that first date to be him cooking dinner with me and staying over. This is made more unhinged by the fact that I have not had a single successful first date. I started dating in January for the first time since I was 23. I’m bad at it, as are generally all men.</p>



<p>3:45 p.m. — Purchased two ribeye steaks from the local butcher shop for dinner tonight. The guy, we can call him H., has promised to impress me with his grilling ability. The butcher shop is super high quality and a local legend kind of place. I have run out of things to clean and am trying to be chill while I wait for H. to get into town. Also worth noting: my ex-husband, out of nowhere, shipped me a large package that arrived today containing my military dress uniform, five old stretched out ponytail holders, a chewed up pair of sneakers, travel shampoo/conditioner and travel deodorant, moisturizer, and a broken hair clip. So he seems to be doing great. I have cut off communication and this feels like a desperate play to get attention. I will not give him the satisfaction of acknowledging it. <strong>$38.67</strong></p>



<p>9:00 p.m. — Dinner consists of cold ribeye and broccolini. H. made it into town a lot later than anticipated. He was halfway here when he got an alert that a wildfire had started near his house and his neighborhood was being evacuated so he turned around. They got it under control after about an hour, so this man turned back around and still ended up coming to see me. Wild. He got here around 7:30 p.m., we started making dinner after I showed him around the house and introduced him to C. Somewhere between pulling the steaks from the grill and now, things got spicy. We’re enjoying cold steaks and having a good laugh about it. This continues to be the most inadvisable first date I can imagine. We watched a comedy special after dinner and then went to bed.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $38.67</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Two: Sunday </h3>



<p>6:30 a.m. — Breakfast is another half bagel and cream cheese with coffee. C. has his standard dog food and blueberries. H. left early this morning to get home and get ready for the workweek. I’m existing and trying to understand what on earth I’m doing. The plan for the day is doing some laundry and my Fantasy Football league draft. I get a text from H. when he makes it home to let me know he got there safely. Not ghosting me right away is good, right?</p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — I’m suddenly starving and DoorDash a chile relleno burrito, chips and guac, and “Mexican fries” from a local taco shop. I love this burrito. I have never tried the fries but they’re really good. I don’t eat very many of them, or really any of the chips and guacamole, because the burrito is enormous. Why I decided to get anything with it no longer makes sense to me. I’m currently couch rotting and waiting for the Fantasy draft to start. I end up taking a nap to make up for staying up late last night with H. I also end up autodrafting versus actively participating in the league draft. This is a good choice since I don’t actually follow football. <strong>$25.75</strong></p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — Dinner is leftover chips and guacamole, with the addition of salsa. Benefit of living alone: no one can judge your eating habits. Freedom has its perks. After couch rotting all afternoon and eating like garbage, I head up to bed early and read until I fall asleep. I’m currently shamelessly vacillating between fantasy smut and traditional romance. Tomorrow I’m back to work so an early bedtime and a restful day are hopefully setting me up for success. I get a goodnight text from H., so that makes me smile. It freaks me out that I like him and that this weekend went reasonably well.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $25.75</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Three: Monday </h3>



<p>5:40 a.m. — I wake up without snoozing my alarm, feed C., make coffee and eat the traditional half bagel. (I’m wild, I know.) There’s a good morning text from H. while I’m eating breakfast. I take mornings really slow — I like to listen to the <em>NYT’s The Headlines</em>, sit on the couch, work on a crossword and spelling bee, read email, and generally relax until about 7 a.m. It’s my morning dilly-dally routine and it gives me joy. At 7 a.m., I start to get ready for work and it’s back to reality.</p>



<p>12:00 p.m. — We have a new physician starting today and I happen to not have a meeting over the lunch hour, so I join him and the manager of the clinic for the new employee lunch. They have my favorite soup in the cafeteria today, chicken tortilla soup, so of course I get that. My assistant puts it on my Outlook calendar when it is ‘Tortilla Soup Day’. It kills me. She is for sure one of my favorite humans. Lunch is good, small talk is successful, and I spend a little time after in my office before the afternoon meeting marathon. <strong>$4.69</strong></p>



<p>2:30 p.m. — I did a very bad job of planning my grocery pick-up last Friday and decide that instead of suffering for the week I will place another order, this time for delivery. I also give in to some cravings with this purchase. I get hot honey, chicken sausages, half a loaf of sourdough, hamburger buns, green onions, heirloom tomato, sliced cheese, cauliflower, a steak, ground beef, cilantro, jalapeños, Gatorade zero powder (I’m addicted to lemon lime Gatorade zero), Beecher’s cheddar, water crackers, and some fancy jam. <strong>$118.75</strong></p>



<p>6:00 p.m. — Dinner is also meal prep this evening. I sear some chicken thighs, add a ton of zucchini and yellow squash to the pan, along with dry riesling and some chicken stock, and let it simmer. I add cherry tomatoes and orzotto once the chicken is breaking down and pull the chicken apart, so it is more bite sized. I finish by adding ricotta and crushed red pepper. It’s frigging delicious. I made the recipe up so who knows if I can ever successfully repeat it. I eat and spoon the leftovers into Tupperware servings for lunches. I love to cook and I hate following a recipe. It has been such a luxury to be able to be fully creative in the kitchen again. Also: exactly why the kitchen remodel was worth it. I opted for an induction range and reaaaalllyy love it. </p>



<p>7:40 p.m. — I’m still figuring out how to live in my new kitchen, and decide I need something to organize the spatulas etc in the drawer by the oven. I hop on Amazon and find an OXO organizer and add it to my cart. I also add another bag of multi-colored letter beads to fuel my current Taylor Swift friendship bracelet therapy. I make them for the songs that stick out to me for any given mood and usually wear a few every day. I pick them to go with my mood or how I want the day to go. It is a whole thing and I’m not ashamed. I also toss in better belly rawhides and check out. C. really likes them and we go through them frequently. I watch an episode of <em>The Gilded Age</em> with a glass of wine and head to bed. I get a goodnight text from H. before I fall asleep. <strong>$24.25</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $147.69</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Four: Tuesday </h3>



<p>5:40 a.m. — As usual, I’m up at 5:40 a.m., feed C., make coffee, and eat half a bagel. No good morning text from H. today. I cave and text him good morning at 6:21 a.m. and get an immediate reply. I’m overthinking it. Luckily, I have an insane meeting schedule today and won’t be able to dwell on it. First meeting starts at 7 a.m., so the dilly dally is cut short this morning. I have essentially back-to-back meetings until 5 p.m. so the dread is real.</p>



<p>11:00 a.m. — I have a 15-minute gap between meetings to handle being a biological being. I scramble to the bathroom, toss my lunch in the microwave, take up temporary residence in the affectionately dubbed ‘squatters office’ (there is a tiny office in the executive suite directly adjacent to the toilet with the expected acoustics) and try and clear my email before the next meeting while eating my lunch (the prepped chicken pasta) and yapping with L., the executive team’s Administrative Assistant. I’m currently reeling from the last meeting where it was announced that we need to submit three financial improvement tactics per department by next Friday. I did the math: 51 strategies. I text H. that we need to make a plan to see each other, so I have something to look forward to and he responds quickly to see what is going on and we text but don’t make an actual plan. After responding to a few emails, I head to the boardroom to talk about marketing campaigns. The glamour.</p>



<p>6:45 p.m. — I’m home, makeup off, in my comfies, and C. has been fed. I’m very mentally wiped out from the day, and listening to an audiobook while I cook. Dinner was supposed to be frittata as per the plan, but I currently can’t use my oven (the vent fan is insanely loud, so I have a technician coming on Thursday to look at it). I make a veggie scramble instead. I used to essentially never eat eggs unless they were in frittata form, but I have evolved into someone who can eat them relatively reliably over the last year. H. has continued reliable communication, yay! I received an email from my ex-husband confirming that I received the package he sent… cry for attention again. It had tracking, bro, you know I got it. I call my mom and debrief about the package and email. </p>



<p>8:00 p.m. — I’m still hungry so I have a little bowl of skinny popcorn in bed and yet again, hop on Amazon. The first Huskers game of the season is Thursday and I have decided this means I can buy a Huskers shirt. I find a cute cropped option and add it to the cart. I also get a coffee grinder and an oil splatter guard for cooking. I accidentally bought whole bean coffee in my pick-up order, and I was annoyed by a lot of oil splatter recently, so maybe I can also justify these purchases. I have been dwelling on my marriage this evening. My ex-husband succeeded in disturbing my peace. I’m frustrated because I want to focus on what may or may not be happening with H. and not dwell on the regret of what I let myself live through. I eventually fall asleep and actually have good dreams. <strong>$75.64</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $75.64</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Five: Wednesday</h3>



<p>5:40 a.m. — Up at 5:40 a.m, feed C., make coffee, eat half a bagel. Dilly dally. It’s another relatively packed day. H. texts me to tell me to have a better day than yesterday which is sweet. We have the annual board retreat today and I have them touring one of my clinics that’s in the end stages of a remodel. I’m showing off a new mobile clinic we purchased this year which should be operational by mid September! I get a call from the property manager, R., alerting me to an issue with the mobile clinic. Apparently his boss, J., decided to get involved this morning and change the plan for how I wanted the mobile clinic displayed. I head in to the office for my first meeting.</p>



<p>10:00 a.m. — I have a gap between meetings and head down to see the mobile clinic. I’m immediately not happy. It is not hooked up to the truck, not level, blocking a fire hydrant, and the stairs are set up in possibly the worst way to access the clinic. I call R., who doesn’t answer, and then J. J. tells me the set up is fine. I disagree. After a pissing match, R. comes to help me redo the set up. I had to force J’s hand and he is not happy. I don’t care. I celebrate the victory with an iced coffee and head to my next meeting. <strong>$4.00</strong></p>



<p>11:30 — I don’t have a gap to eat in private so I heat up my lunch (the pasta/chicken sitch), snag some red pepper and eat in a meeting. I hate doing that, but I’m already in a mood thanks to J., and we don’t need to add an element of hangry, too. The meeting is good — easy ask. I get a text from my boss thanking me for fixing the mobile clinic situation before the board saw it. I feel vindicated. Next, I go to a staff huddle for a team that is not happy with a process change I’m making. I try to get in front of people if they are unhappy with me or a change, so they can get their feelings out to my face and we can talk about it. Not sure this is the best change management technique, but I don’t want to be the coward who hides in my office when I’m unpopular. It goes relatively well, their perspectives are valid, and it’s good to hear them out before we implement the change.</p>



<p>6:00 p.m. — I’m home. I survived an end-of-day-energy-suck-of-a-meeting with one of the more aggressive physicians. It was a wild ride. My boss and I are still texting about it. What a day. I’m making pasta again — tonight is orecchiette with Italian chicken sausage, zucchini, spinach, and cherry tomatoes. It turns out great. H. texts me to see how my day went by asking “did you kick some ass today”, and I can honestly reply in the affirmative. We catch up a bit via text. My friend K. calls and we gossip about my former workplace. I seem to pick up a work bestie every time I move to a new job. She’s the best. She helped me make the decision to leave my marriage. She is probably the only person I was fully honest with about what was happening while I was still in the relationship. After the gossip session, I clean up from dinner and try to decide on something to watch.</p>



<p>7:30 — I haven’t succeeded in selecting anything to watch. I’m now listening to an audiobook and having a snack of cheese and triscuits with a glass of wine. I text H. around 8 p.m. to see if he wants to talk on the phone to no response. I have a small spiral about it before I shake it off. I have a very helpful mantra when I spiral, thanks to K.: I’m not special and it’s not about me. In essence, I’m not the star of anyone else’s movie and people’s actions are about them, not me. It was very freeing to realize that people really aren’t thinking about me. That dumb thing I said in a meeting? They already forgot. H. will be H., if he wants to try he will. Lights out by 8:45 p.m.</p>

<h3>Day Six: Thursday </h3>



<p>5:40 a.m. — Up at the usual time, feed C., make coffee, eat half a bagel with cream cheese. Dilly dally. I was able to condense all of my meetings into the morning today, and will have to come back and work from home this afternoon. I need to be here for having the range serviced. Not sad about it. Knowing I have a short day, I wear a really cute but really uncomfortable dress and heels. I wouldn’t want to wear this outfit if I had to suffer through a whole day, but I can put fashion first for five hours. H. texted first thing this morning apologizing for missing the text about a call and explaining he has his phone on Do Not Disturb after 8 p.m, was engrossed in a project etc., and I feel happy that he cared to explain.</p>



<p>12:00 — I’m home from the office now and heating up lunch — the same meal prepped chicken pasta. It’s really good, so it isn’t miserable having it on repeat. I’m glad to be home and can focus on developing the 51 strategies. The bright side: I can make a spreadsheet. That is the only upside I can think of so far. As I am working on it, I get another email adding reviewing the travel budgets for every department by the same deadline. F**k. H. texts to ask about my day. He is having a good one, so that’s great. My day improves when the range is fixed and I get an email from a clinician I interviewed and offered a job to saying that he is accepting the offer! Yay! Recruiting is going well.</p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — I’m making a chicken sausage and veggie hash for dinner. Potatoes, bell peppers, onions, zucchini, and yellow squash with a spicy green chile chicken sausage. I really like spicy foods — I have a whole collection of hot sauce at home and in the office. I have my laptop in the kitchen to have Hulu on as the Huskers game is on ESPN. It turns out I do not have the ESPN add-on or the live ESPN add-on, so I spend the $14.65 to upgrade so I can watch the game. I finish making dinner and eat while the game kicks off. It ends up being a good one — competitive — and the Huskers clinch the win. Great way to start the season! H is sending me videos of the tinkering projects he’s working on. He’s very mechanically inclined and I’ve discovered is always working on some side project. I find this cute. I’m up later than normal to finish watching the game and can’t fall asleep right away after it, so I know I will be tired tomorrow, but tomorrow is Friday so I will survive. <strong>$14.65</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $14.65</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Seven: Friday </h3>



<p>6:45 a.m. — Up way later than normal, feed C., make coffee, go to eat an entire bagel but half has mold, so I make the questionable choice to eat the half with no visible mold. Text H. good morning. I realize everything today has a remote option minus a lunch. I’m taking a team that is getting hit by layoffs to lunch today to thank them for their work. I’m worried about it, it seems like it could be bad/flippant in the scheme of the layoffs and surrounding drama. I text H. about it and he shares my sentiment. I text my assistant that I’m planning to be remote today and happily work from my bed throughout the morning, keeping my camera off. </p>



<p>1:45 p.m. — The lunch ended up being relatively great. The team is really funny and has made peace with the situation. The conversation is excellent and we ended up at the restaurant for an hour and 45 minutes before we wrapped up. I took a group photo of everyone. That moment felt really sad. They get their severance next week, and then hopefully I will see them around town. I get in my car, happy the lunch went well but sad about the layoffs. <strong>$142.00</strong> <strong>(Expensed so not included)</strong></p>



<p>2:00 p.m. — After lunch I go to the grocery store to complete the weekly grocery pick up. I coupon and meal plan around the deals. This week I bought more than normal to take advantage of some really good coupon offers — so I’m now really well supplied with toilet paper and Cottonelle wipes. I also bought a decent amount of wine to stock the “wine cellar” (creepy basement closet with a vent fan). Groceries are a steak, chicken sausage, zucchini, yellow squash, lettuce, cheese, two bags of birdseed, coffee, peaches, lemons, limes, ice-cream sandwiches, tomatoes, spinach, broth, onions, and the aforementioned wine. I saved $108.21 by shopping sales and couponing. This is an all-time high for me. I’m jazzed and no one else in the world will ever care about it. I head home, put away the groceries and sit back down at the laptop to wrap up work. <strong>$193.67</strong></p>



<p>3:45 p.m. — My friend L. invites me to grab a beer to wrap up the week. She is solo this weekend as her husband is going hunting. We meet at a tap house and each grab a beer. I get a rye porter that has a low ABV. A dark beer with a low ABV will always get me. We nurse our beers for about two hours while we talk about work, trees, the remodel I’m doing, and the one she is planning on. It’s nice to have someone to just yammer with. A guy from work stops by our table and says hello and we make polite small talk. L. asks if I have had any decent dates lately and I tell her about H. I text him a ‘cheers’ photo. We wrap up around 5:45 p.m. and I head home to feed C. and make dinner. <strong>$7.43</strong></p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — It’s Friday so I let myself have a glass of wine while I make dinner. I am having pasta, again. I need to use the last of the Italian chicken sausage. It’s similar to the pasta I made earlier in the week, but I add ricotta at the end so it is super creamy. H. is texting me photos of getting ready to go camping on the coast with his daughter. I didn’t realize he had her this weekend, and it is WAY too early to ask about the custody arrangement. He is a super doting dad, which I think is a good sign he is a decent human. After dinner I put on <em>The Materialists</em> and head to bed before it’s finished, I’m so tired. I hear the ring of a goodnight text from H. while I am drifting off. Decent week.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $201.10</strong></p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>



<p>I impulse bought from Amazon a little more than I would’ve liked to. I really don’t like to support Amazon, but it’s so convenient. I’ve been trying to be budget conscious with the remodel, and actually think I did okay — minus the DoorDash order. I realized I’m not very exciting, at least not in my current phase of life. It was fun to write and reflect on how I’m spending. Hopefully, in the future there are a few more “fun” purchases.</p>

<p>In a sea of steamers, so-called TV slop, and endless options, <a href=""https://tv.apple.com/?itsct=atvp_brand_omd&amp;itscg=MC_20000&amp;mttn3pid=Google+AdWords&amp;mttnagencyid=a5e&amp;mttncc=US&amp;mttnsiteid=143238&amp;mttnsubad=OUS2019801_1-774134829080-c&amp;mttnsubkw=75222244984_kwd-67743848_idXQ476O_&amp;mttnsubplmnt=_adext_"">Apple TV</a> has quietly emerged as the service that provides quality over quantity. When other streaming services are rumored to be <a href=""https://variety.com/2026/film/news/matt-damon-netflix-movies-restate-plot-viewers-on-phones-1236633939/"">churning out content that (allegedly)</a> intentionally caters to people who are playing shows in the background while they do chores or are <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/matt-damon-netflix-plots-reiterated-distracted-viewers-1236477116/"">on their phones</a>, Apple TV is respecting audiences that actually, you know, <em>pay attention </em>during the movies and TV shows they watch. </p>



<p>At a splashy press day in LA where they flew in press and influencers from around the world and trotted out their best talent to showcase first-look teaser trailers, Apple TV unveiled their packed 2026 slate, and we’re already <em>seated</em>. Multiple women-led series are front and center, and each feel engineered for the post-antihero era: shows about how it feels to live inside messy systems — capitalism, patriarchy, desire, family, fame — and still want more. More pleasure. More honesty. More money. More luck.</p>



<p>Apple TV already has a slate of great shows, and the casts of some of my personal faves (<em>Shrinking</em>, <em>The Last Thing He Told Me,</em> <em>Pluribus</em>, <em>Your Friends and Neighbors</em>) were in attendance to hype up their new seasons.<em> </em>As for the new shows, from chaotic motherhood and money woes to the messy realities of female friendship, Apple’ TVs latest offerings are giving us the kind of complex, flawed, deeply relatable characters we’ve been craving. Forget your typical glossy prestige dramas, these shows promise to be raw, funny, uncomfortable, and exactly what we need right now.</p>



<p>From a darkly funny meditation on female gratification to a glossy moral thriller about wealth and consequence, Apple’s latest slate signals a clear creative thesis: women don’t need to be likable, tidy, or redeemed, they just need to be <em>interesting</em>. </p>



<p>Here’s everything you need to know about Apple TV’s four new women-led shows that defined the day and are about to become your entire personality.</p>



<h2><strong><em>Maximum Pleasure Guaranteed</em></strong></h2>



<p><strong>Starring: </strong>Tatiana Maslany, Jake Johnson, Brandon Flynn<br /><strong>Premieres:</strong> May 20, 2026 </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957813.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>If the title alone doesn’t have you immediately intrigued, let me paint you a picture: What happens when a woman decides to take control of her pleasure and it backfires, badly? <em><a href=""https://deadline.com/2026/02/maximum-pleasure-guaranteed-apple-tv-premiere-date-photos-1236706239/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Maximum Pleasure Guaranteed</a></em> follows newly divorced mom Paula (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2015/04/84634/tatiana-maslany-orphan-black-interview"">Tatiana Maslany</a>) as conversing with a cam boy leads her down a destructive path of murder, blackmail and… youth soccer. I sat through a whole panel about this show and I still don’t get where the soccer comes into play, but rest assured if Maslany is there, so will I. </p>



<p>Convinced she witnessed a crime, Maslany’s Paula begins her own investigation that unravels a bigger conspiracy as she looks to rebuild her family and regain her self identity. <em><a href=""https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2026/02/apple-tvs-darkly-comedic-thriller-maximum-pleasure-guaranteed-starring-emmy-award-winner-tatiana-maslany-and-jake-johnson-to-make-global-debut-may-20/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Maximum Pleasure Guaranteed</a></em> is a full-throated (pun absolutely intended) exploration of desire, agency, and what it means to prioritize your own happiness in a society that low-key punishes women for doing exactly that.</p>



<h2><em>Imperfect Women</em></h2>



<p><strong>Starring: </strong>Elisabeth Moss, Kerry Washington, and Kate Mara<br /><strong>Premieres:</strong> March 18, 2026</p>







<p>Think <em>Big Little Lies </em>meets <em>Pretty Little Liars</em> meets <em>Little Fires Everywhere </em>except there is nothing “little” about these women. After a possible murder shatters shatters the lives of three women in a decades-long friendship,<em> <a href=""https://tv.apple.com/us/show/imperfect-women/umc.cmc.1w2rmpbqzt24879bt7109zgi6"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Imperfect Women</a></em> kicks off into a high-octane thriller that is sure to keep us guessing until its final minute. I was holding my breath during the entire teaser trailer. </p>



<p>According to Apple TV, “The unconventional thriller explores guilt and retribution, love and betrayal, and the compromises we make that irrevocably alter our lives. As the investigation unfolds, so does the truth about how even the closest friendships may not be what they seem.” That does sound intriguing but they had me at <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/kerry-washington"">Kerry Washington,</a> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/02/9481023/elizabeth-moss-invisible-man-performance-scary"">Elisabeth Moss</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/08/121778/kate-mara-movies-morgan-2016"">Kate Mara.</a> </p>



<h2><em>Lucky</em></h2>



<p><strong>Starring: </strong>Anya Taylor-Joy, Annette Bening, Timothy Olyphant, Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, and Drew Starkey<br /><strong>Premieres:</strong> July 15. 2026</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957807.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/anya-taylor-joy-mad-max-furiosa-interview"">Anya Taylor-Joy</a> plays a fugitive con artist. You’re sold, right? Same. Written by Jonathan Tropper and Cassie Pappas and based on <a href=""https://reesesbookclub.com/book/lucky/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Marissa Stapley’s bestselling novel, </a><em><a href=""https://reesesbookclub.com/book/lucky/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lucky</a></em> centers on a young woman (Taylor-Joy) who was raised in a life of crime but is trying to leave that life behind. Now, she “must now embrace her darker, criminal side one final time in a desperate attempt to escape her past,” so says the show’s official synopis. </p>



<p>Taylor-Joy also serves as an exective producer on the project and it marks her first TV series since 2020’s smash hit (and pandemic savior), <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/08/9993184/netflix-the-queen-gambit-trailer-anya-taylor-joy"">The Queen’s Gambit.</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/08/9993184/netflix-the-queen-gambit-trailer-anya-taylor-joy""> </a></p>



<p>Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor and Timothy Olyphant also star. </p>



<h2>Margo’s Got Money Troubles </h2>



<p><strong>Starring: </strong>Elle Fanning, Michelle Pfeiffer, Nick Offerman<br /><strong>Premieres:</strong> April 15. 2026</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957816.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=682&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A341"" /></figure>



<p><em><a href=""https://deadline.com/feature/margos-got-money-troubles-show-news-updates-1236412988/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Margo’s Got Money Troubles</a></em> is a “bold, heartwarming and comedic family drama following recent college dropout and aspiring writer, Margo (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/04/229557/teen-spirit-movie-review-elle-fanning-max-minghella"">Elle Fanning</a>), the daughter of an ex-Hooters waitress (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/michellepfeifferofficial/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Michelle Pfeiffer</a>) and ex-pro wrestler (<a href=""https://nickofferman.co/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nick Offerman</a>), as she’s forced to make her way with a new baby, a mounting pile of bills and a dwindling amount of ways to pay them.”</p>



<p>I wanted to get that synopsis right because I didn’t think you’d believe me if I said Michelle Pfeiffer is playing an ex-Hooters waitess and Nick Offerman would be tattooed-up wrestler. These aren’t the roles we’re used to from these two iconic performers, but I’ve seen some of the show, and, <em>whew</em>, they are such pros, you’re going to be blown away. I imagine that series creator David E. Kelly wanted to surround Pfeiffer with the absolute best to match her star power. And, of course, Elle Fanning did just that. Aside from the storyline that sounds like a perfect premise for a realistic, messy, and absurd look at motherhood, Fanning proves she is one of the best working young actresses in Hollywood.</p>

<p>They say you can’t beat a classic, but if my Instagram feed is anything to go by, the humble <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/french-tip-nail-manicure-autumn-color-trends"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">French manicure</a> is undergoing something of a makeover. It began with the “<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/french-fade-manicure-nail-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">French fade</a>”, a look that blends the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tinted-glow-french-manicure-nails-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">French manicure</a>’s signature white tip into the nail’s neutral base for a soft, melted ombré effect. Another recent favorite is the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/deep-french-tips-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">“deep” French</a>: a chunkier take on the traditional tip that pays homage to the early ’00s. Fast forward to February and another trend has entered our radar — what we’re coining the “phantom” French — and it’s one for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/iced-french-manicure-nail-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">French manicure</a> <em>and </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nail-manicure-trends-2026"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">cat-eye nail</a> obsessives alike. </p>



<h2>What is the phantom French manicure? </h2>



<p>Before we get into the nitty-gritty, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glass-french-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">cat-eye French tips</a> are nothing new, relying on a magnet to maneuver metal particles into formation, creating a reflective, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/11/11185958/velvet-nails-trend-magentic-gel-manicure"">velvety effect</a> — much like a cat’s eye in the dark. In that instance, however, the cat-eye polish is usually painted as a French tip over a neutral gel base. The “phantom” French is a little different. This time, the entire nail is coated in cat-eye polish, but the magnet is used in a way that draws only some — not all — of the particles to the tip, creating a French tip effect. Depending on the light or the movement of your fingers, the French tip seems to appear and disappear, hence the “phantom” part. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sadgirlnails/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Natalia Mercedes</a>, nail artist and founder of <a href=""https://www.sadgirlnails.com/"">Sad Girl Nails Studio</a> in New York City, has a theory about why we’re gravitating toward a more subtle take on the French manicure: “There’s definitely a renewed interest in softer, more understated French tips,” says Mercedes, “but at the same time, bold and graphic French designs are just as relevant.” Its recent popularity stems from its subtlety, Mercedes adds. “It’s a modern evolution of a classic that feels especially sleek right now,” she says, “but it’s less about one trend replacing another. Instead, it’s about the range of expression people are embracing.” </p>

<h2>How do you achieve the phantom French manicure? </h2>



<p>The “phantom” French manicure requires a skilled hand, and everyone seems to do it a little differently. On Instagram, digital creator and nail artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/C-fZFgvAF4c/?hl=en"">Melanie Graves</a> paints her nails with silver cat-eye polish, then places a magnet on either side of the nail to draw the particles inward into a reflective formation. Before curing, she positions a longer magnet at the center of the nail, pushing the magnetic pigments toward the tip to create negative space. The result? A cat-eye French tip that’s only visible at certain angles. </p>

<p>Mercedes has her own method. “The ‘phantom’ effect in cat-eye French tips comes down to both layering and magnet technique,” she says, adding, “It’s about guiding the magnetic particles with intention, then letting light do the rest.” As the nail catches different angles, Mercedes explains, the design appears to shift, fade, and re-emerge. “This creates an illusion of movement.” </p>



<p>While it might sound a little complicated, a qualified nail tech will know exactly what to do. If in doubt, arrive armed with plenty of reference images. The phantom French manicure works on all nail shapes, from almond, like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DFS-YdrNbzD/?hl=en"">these by Koleva,</a> to squoval, like this set posted to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CvgVDy0oGIc/?hl=en"">Instagram by @Nai__Spa</a>.</p>

<p>We love this neutral set posted to Instagram by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DS5SyQ8gLyS/"">Polish’d Nail Bar</a>. The cat-eye polish closely matches the gel base, subtly blurring the line between the tip and the rest of the nail.</p>

February is the month we mostly associate with love and our heart’s deepest desires. While <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/valentines-day"">Valentine’s Day</a> can be performative and capitalistic, Spirit is asking you to drop what’s surface level and get more <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-practice-self-love-yourself"">intimate with yourself</a>. This month, center the relationship you have with your inner knowing. Your heart has been holding the truth this whole time. It knows what needs to shift, what you've been avoiding, and what you actually want but haven't let yourself say out loud. You've been overriding it with logic, drowning it out with productivity, and silencing it because what it's asking for feels too vulnerable, too big, and too real. <br /><br />With that, this month's Tarotscopes goes straight to the point, cuts through the noise, and gives you direct access to what your heart has been trying to tell you about 2026. This is the year you get to reconnect to your own innate wisdom and allow that to lead you.<br /><br />Read for your sun, moon, and rising, let your heart respond, and then be brave enough to listen.<figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957504.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18) Three of Swords</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that the grief you've been intellectualizing needs to be felt. Chances are you are still energetically carrying remnants of 2025, and as we pivot onto the new Chinese year and, soon, the new astrological year, it’s time to fully release these bonds. You've processed it in therapy, journaled about it, and understood the lesson, but you haven't let yourself actually break open and weep. This year, your heart is asking you to stop analyzing your pain and start moving it through your body. You're brilliant at making sense of things, but some wounds don't heal through understanding. They heal through release. Through letting your nervous system discharge what it's been holding. Trust that falling apart won't destroy you. Instead, it will regulate you. Your heart knows that what's on the other side of that grief is the kind of clarity and creative power you've been searching for. Feel it and let it move.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957505.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>PISCES (February 19 - March 20) The Star</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that your sensitivity is your spiritual technology, and not something to fix. You've been trying to build thicker skin, set firmer boundaries, and be less affected by the energy around you. Energetic boundaries are a must in your book, but this year, your heart is reminding you that your porousness is your gift. Yes, still maintain a healthy routine of spiritual hygiene, just don’t disregard the fact that you can feel everything because you’re meant to. It's how you receive information, how you read energy, and how you serve. The work isn't to become less sensitive. It's to get so clear in your energetic sovereignty that you can stay open without losing yourself. You're not too much. You're tuned to a frequency most people can't access and you’re able to travel within many realms. Your heart wants you to stop apologizing for it and start leveraging it. Your sensitivity is your superpower. Use it intentionally.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957506.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>ARIES (March 21 - April 19) Queen of Wands</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that your ambition is sacred, not selfish. You've been treating your desire for more like it's something to apologize for, scared that if you expand too much or too fast, you’ll leave others behind. This year, you will put an end to that. There are those that are anticipating such rapid growth and conquest from you and others who will never understand what it’s like to have such hunger for the attainment of your own expansion. Leave them behind. Your heart is asking you to lead from your fire, so don’t dare contract your energy to make others comfortable. The Creator is waiting for you to embody your full authority and stop performing humility. Trust that your body knows the difference between ego and divine assignment. Propel forward with what burns in you. These are not random impulses; it is purposeful direction. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957507.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>TAURUS (April 20 - May 20) Four of Pentacles</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that safety isn't the same as sovereignty. It’s time to step out of the safety structures you’ve built, the same routines and patterns that keep you bound to the same old energies. These structures are here to protect you; however, they’re also keeping you small. This year is asking you to examine what you're gripping so tightly that you can't receive what's actually trying to reach you. Your body has been holding patterns of scarcity that your current reality doesn't even reflect anymore. You've outgrown survival programming, but your nervous system hasn't caught up yet. Your heart knows you're ready for the next level of wealth, but your hands are still clenched around what you already have: in your body, mind, and soul. This is the year you stretch your energetic container beyond its current standards. Not by thinking your way through it, but by embodying the frequency of the woman who has already arrived. Let your heart lead you into the softness of true security.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957508.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>GEMINI (May 21 - June 20) The Lovers</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that you don't have to choose between your spiritual path and your human desires; both can co-exist. You've been treating pleasure like it's separate from your purpose, like wanting love or partnership or sensual fulfillment somehow makes you less committed to your work. That's a lie that you have programmed as the truth. This is not the year of compromise. This year, your heart is calling you into integration: the marriage of your spiritual gifts with your very real need for connection, intimacy, and being met. You can be devoted to your spiritual practice and still want someone to come home to. You can channel divine wisdom and still crave physical touch. Stop splitting yourself in half and having to choose breadcrumbs. Your heart knows the truth: devotion to Spirit includes devotion to your whole self. What is for you will find you.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957509.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>CANCER (June 21 - July 22) Six of Cups</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that healing your lineage doesn't mean carrying it alone. You've been doing the ancestral work, clearing the patterns, and walking through the timelines, but somewhere in there, you started believing that being the cycle-breaker means you can't ask for support. Practice calling in support from all areas: from your spirit allies, friends, the Creator, etc. Healing happens best in community, whether it is physical or non-physical. This year, you get to have things handled for you, which speeds up your development. At the same time, you might discover some potent medicine within you that is ready to be shared with your community. If you’ve been accustomed to supporting everyone else, flip the switch this year. Your lineage doesn't need another martyr. It needs you whole, resourced, and connected. Let your heart show you what it feels like to heal in the presence of love and be the first to receive before pouring out onto others.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957510.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>LEO (July 23 - August 22) Ace of Wands</strong><br /><br />That creative fire building inside you isn't just inspiration; it's revelation. It’s your green light to shine. You've been treating your ideas like hobbies and side projects you'll get to when everything else is handled. But your heart knows that what's wanting to be born through you right now is the main event. This is your year to stop relegating your creative genius to the margins of your life and start centering it. The project, the offering, the vision you've been refining, it has been ready. You've been studying the masters, learning the craft, and absorbing the wisdom. Now it's your turn to create from that place and implement what you’ve learned. Stop preparing and start building. Your heart knows the world is waiting for what only you can deliver. A little goes a long way. Pace yourself but start now. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957511.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>VIRGO (August 23 - September 22) The Hermit</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that rest is not a reward for productivity; rather, it's the foundation of it. You've been running on excellence and determination, optimizing every area of your life while ignoring the quiet voice that keeps asking you to slow down. Slowing down is the key to wealth in all forms. Learning how to embody your desires and listen to the wisdom within you will be a game changer for you. You have nothing to prove. This year, your heart is calling you into sacred withdrawal. Not burnout. The kind of intentional solitude where your nervous system can finally regulate, where the downloads can land, and where you remember who you are without the performance of achievement. You're doing such important work in the world, but you can't pour from a depleted well. This is the year where you normalize being in overflow and you stay there. Your heart knows that the next level of your impact requires you to be full first. Give yourself permission to disappear for a while and, most importantly, to be selfish.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957512.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>LIBRA (September 23 - October 22) Two of Swords</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that indecision is just you avoiding listening to your own intuition. You've been sitting at the crossroads, weighing options, gathering more information, waiting for absolute certainty before you make the move. But how many more signs do you need before you act on what you already know? Your heart already knows the answer. The choice you're avoiding isn't actually between two equal paths. Chances are it's between the life you know and the life you're being called into. This year demands that you trust your inner knowing over everyone else's opinions. You already do the inner work. You journal, you pray, and you listen. You have access to your intuition. Stop pretending you don't know how to access what your heart is telling you. The answer is already there. Choose it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957513.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>SCORPIO (October 23 - November 21) Knight of Cups</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that you're allowed to want love without having to nearly sabotage yourself to deserve it. You've made intimacy a spiritual test, turned every relationship into an initiation, convinced yourself that real love only counts if it brings you to your knees first. You don’t have to abandon yourself in order to have your desire. You can ascend, be your best self, and still be blessed. This year, your heart is asking you to open to a different frequency, the kind of love that doesn't require you to prove your worth through suffering. You've done the shadow work in abundance, and 2025 has led you through the darkness and back to the light again. You've faced your depths, walked through the fire, and you survived. Now let your heart show you what it's like to be chosen softly, met consistently, and loved without the chaos. Or better yet, you decide to do the choosing. Choose yourself and then make an informed and elevated decision to choose another from a space of autonomy and clarity. Don’t burn yourself down because you think you’re lacking something.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957514.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21) King of Wands</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that your vision is too big for you to keep playing small in the execution.

This year calls for you to stop consuming inspiration and simply embody it. You are meant to push yourself into leadership and action. You don’t need any more encouragement, examples, or steps. What you need is to trust that you know what you’re doing and to do it. Individuals will be astonished with your bold energy and growth. It’s less talk and more walk. You have nothing to prove to anyone and ample time to execute excellence. There are people around you who need to see you at your highest level, so they have permission to operate on their own. Your heart knows you're capable of the vision you keep downloading. Now build it like you mean it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957515.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19) Nine of Pentacles</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that you've already earned the right to enjoy your life — now, live it to the fullest. You have expanded your sense of self-worth, stayed committed to your goals, strengthened your foundation and stability, but yet you’re still moving from a space of scarcity, and like everything can crumble at any minute. This year, your heart is asking you to practice receiving pleasure without attaching it to productivity. Buy the thing without justifying it. Rest without earning it first. Let yourself be luxurious, not as a future reward but as a present reality. This is the standard now. As you’re expanding your capacity to do more, be more, and hold more energy, you can also attract more. So you should enjoy it! You're an energetic match for wealth in all forms, but your nervous system is still running the old program. Your heart wants you in your opulence now. Not when you hit the next milestone. Now. Let yourself live like the abundant person you already are.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?</strong></p>",

<p><em>Sponsored by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, and Emmeka and Dr. Gupta were compensated by Novartis.</em></p>



<p>A tingle that turns into an itch that only becomes worse as you scratch it. A feeling that may resemble mosquito bites all over your body. Trouble sleeping, work disruptions, and skipped social events spurred by the anxiety of the hives returning. That’s what flare-ups can be like for people living with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) — an immune-mediated disease characterized by hives and/or deep swelling for more than 6 weeks without a known allergy or external triggers.</p>



<p>When Emmeka, an Iowa-based social media manager and beauty content creator, first noticed itchy, red, welt-like bumps across her back, she worried she was experiencing an allergic reaction. For months, she tried to rule out what might be causing symptoms and considered everything from laundry detergent and beauty products to the food she was eating. “I was continuously trying to figure out what was happening to me and editing my lifestyle to avoid potential triggers; it was a burden,” Emmeka recalls. After a long journey of trying to get to the root cause of her persistent hives, she finally got a diagnosis of CSU.</p>



<p>Living with CSU can feel like being in a bad relationship: compromising, downplaying your needs, and feeling stuck in a cycle of discomfort and frustration.</p>



<p>Dr. Payel Gupta, a New York City–based allergist who treats people with CSU, is working to raise awareness of this condition and empower patients to find solutions that work for them. “Living with CSU shouldn’t mean settling for discomfort,” says Dr. Gupta. “CSU is something you and your doctor can work on together. It’s a partnership, and that means good communication about what’s working, what’s not working, so we can find the right management plan.”</p>



<p>Dr. Gupta and Emmeka recently sat down together to discuss what it means to  be proactive in taking more control of your life with CSU and shared key tips for improving your “relationship” with this chronic condition.</p>







<p>Keep reading for Dr. Gupta’s advice on how to get a better sense of control in your journey with CSU. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938046.png?width=1024&amp;height=384&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=8%3A3"" /></figure>



<p>It took Emmeka 2 years to receive her CSU diagnosis — a delay that’s all too common, as the average time to diagnosis for CSU is over 2 years. Dr. Gupta recommends that patients presenting with symptoms of CSU connect with a specialist, such as an allergist or dermatologist, who is familiar with CSU and the standard diagnostic and treatment protocols for this condition.</p>



<p>“They’ll help you develop a concrete plan of action for when you’re having an acute episode, so that you don’t feel lost or confused and end up needing to seek urgent care,” Dr. Gupta continues. “Seeing a specialist can be a really important step toward getting the help you need to manage this condition in the long term.” </p>



<p>It’s also important that you feel like you can fully open up to your health care provider. “You want to have good communication on both sides. So, if you feel like you’re not being heard or like you’re unable to express yourself, then it’s important to get a second opinion to make sure your concerns can be addressed,” Dr. Gupta says.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938049.png?width=1024&amp;height=485&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A485"" /></figure>



<p>After coming to terms with her CSU, Emmeka decided to share her journey online and was met with support and stories from her online community, empowering her to use her platform as a content creator to raise awareness. </p>



<p>“Community is really important because it reminds you that you’re not alone,” says Dr. Gupta. “Seeing your lived experience mirrored in others helps you feel validated and understood.” </p>



<p>Social media, in particular, can be a valuable space for connection. But Dr. Gupta warns about relying too heavily on advice from non-medical sources: “Use social media for community, but when seeking information, turn to qualified medical professionals and resources based on reputable references, like <em><a href=""https://www.neverjusthives.com/?utm_source=sponsored-content&amp;utm_mlr=fa-11460132&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=sponsored-content_unbranded_r29-sponsored-content_nov-2025&amp;utm_content=rha_csu_patient-story_link-in-article"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Never Just Hives</a>.”</em></p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938048.png?width=1024&amp;height=384&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=8%3A3"" /></figure>



<p>“The biggest misconception is that there’s an allergic trigger,” Dr. Gupta explains. “Some patients blame themselves, thinking their actions caused the symptoms. But the truth is, you’ve done nothing wrong.”</p>



<p>CSU isn’t triggered by external factors like allergies, foods, or environmental irritants. Instead, it’s caused by an overactive immune system. For many patients like Emmeka, the spontaneous nature of this condition can be hard to come to terms with. But listening to your body is a powerful first step. </p>



<p>If you can’t identify a specific trigger, it could be a sign that something else deeper is going on, like CSU. </p>



<p>Dr. Gupta encourages patients to stay connected to their bodies by tracking symptoms and taking photos during flare-ups. This can help facilitate productive conversations with your doctor, and enable you both to work together to find a path forward.</p>

This time, though, it had nothing to do with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-opi-nail-polish-colors#slide-2"">Funny Bunny,</a> the shade behind her iconic <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vanilla-chrome-manicure-nail-art"">“glazed donut” nails</a>. </p>



<p>Bieber swapped her signature blush for a hazelnut-americano-inspired hue, carefully mixed by her longtime friend and LA-based nail artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/nailsbyzola/?hl=en"">Zola Ganzorigt</a>. While appointments with Ganzorigt are rare, she took to Instagram to reveal the exact color combination for those who don’t mind performing a little nail alchemy.  </p>

<p>While Ganzorigt used OPI’s professional GelColor shades for Bieber’s Grammy Awards manicure — a system found in most nail salons — all three shades are also available for at-home use in <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opi.com%2F"">OPI’s Nail Lacquer</a> and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opi.com%2F"">Infinite Shine</a> ranges online. </p>

<p>The likes of Big Apple Red and You Don’t Know Jacques! are considered classics among manicurists, but <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opi.com%2Fproducts%2Finfinite-shine-barefoot-in-barcelona"">Barefoot In Barcelona</a> is one of those shades that has slipped under the radar until now. It occupies a cozy space between blush pink and hazelnut, and its neutral finish suits all skin tones equally.  </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955795.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings, this week opens loud. The Leo Full Moon on February 1st is not subtle, not chill, and definitely not interested in you playing it cool. This is the kind of Full Moon that asks, “Are you actually proud of your life right now, or are you just busy?” Emotions are heightened, egos are tender, and everyone suddenly has a realization they <em>cannot </em>keep to themselves. The challenge is not letting every feeling turn into a performance. The gift is clarity. Something reaches a peak, a reveal, or a moment of truth that says, this matters more than you’ve been admitting. </p>



<p>Adding to the shake-up, Uranus stations direct in Taurus this week, and while it may not come with fireworks, it does come with a sense of momentum finally clicking into place. Think less chaos, more “oh… this is actually happening.” <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2026-meaning-effects"">Changes around money</a>, stability, values, or long-term plans may feel more real and less theoretical now. If something has been brewing quietly for months, this is when it starts to move forward without asking for permission. The key is flexibility. Taurus energy loves comfort, Uranus loves disruption, and this week asks you to find a middle ground between clinging and completely blowing things up. </p>



<p>As the weekend begins, the vibe softens as Mercury enters Pisces, giving the collective permission to stop over-explaining and start feeling things again. Logic takes a backseat to intuition, creativity, and emotional nuance. Communication becomes less about facts and more about tone, timing, and what’s <em>not </em>being said. This is a great week for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/01/11636388/daily-journaling-mental-health-benefits"">dreaming, journaling, art</a>, and letting yourself be a little delusional in a hopeful way. Just remember, Mercury in Pisces can blur lines, so double-check details and be gentle with misunderstandings. Not everything needs an immediate answer. Some things just need space to unfold.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, are you ready to admit what actually lights you up instead of reacting to every spark that comes your way? This week starts with the Leo Full Moon, and for you it feels like a creative or emotional mic drop. Something you’ve been working on, flirting with, or quietly hoping for hits a peak, and suddenly you can’t pretend you don’t care anymore. This could be about love, joy, passion, or a project that feels very <em>you</em>. The temptation is to go full “all eyes on me” and burn yourself out trying to prove a point. The smarter move is choosing what deserves your energy instead of reacting to every feeling that shows up. Not every spark needs to become a wildfire. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Uranus finally stations direct in Taurus, and you may notice a subtle but <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2026-meaning-effects"">real shift around money</a>, confidence, or how secure you feel in your choices. This isn’t a lottery-ticket moment, it’s more like realizing you trust yourself again. Financial ideas or plans that felt unstable now feel workable, and you’re less interested in proving your worth to anyone. If something clicks this week, follow it, but don’t rush it. Momentum doesn’t need chaos to be powerful. </p>



<p>On Friday, Mercury enters Pisces, which is basically your cue to stop explaining yourself so much. Your intuition is louder than logic right now, and forcing clarity will only slow things down. You may feel more introspective, tired, or oddly nostalgic, even as big things are unfolding. Let that happen. This is a behind-the-scenes processing week, not a launch week. Trust that what you’re integrating now is quietly preparing you for a much louder chapter ahead.</p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, something you’ve been emotionally sitting with is ready to move and this week makes it impossible to keep pretending otherwise. The week opens with the Leo Full Moon on February 1st, and for you it lands right in your feelings. Home, family, living situations, and emotional safety are all under a bright spotlight. Something reaches a turning point, a realization, a boundary, or even a decision you’ve been avoiding because it felt “too much.” The temptation here is to dig your heels in or react defensively. The growth comes from being honest about what no longer feels supportive. You don’t need to blow anything up, but you do need to stop pretending everything is fine if it’s not. </p>



<p>Then on February 3rd, Uranus finally stations direct in your sign, and this is big, even if it feels quiet at first. After months of internal recalibration, identity shifts, and stop-start momentum, things begin to move forward with more confidence. You may feel clearer about who you are becoming, less reactive to other people’s expectations, and more willing to choose yourself without over-explaining. This isn’t about instant transformation. It’s about finally trusting the changes you’ve already made. If you’ve been waiting for permission to move differently, consider this it. </p>



<p>As the weekend begins, Mercury enters Pisces, softening your mental pace and turning your attention toward friends, community, and shared dreams. Conversations feel more intuitive than logical, and you may crave emotional resonance over surface-level chatter. This is a great time to reconnect with people who <em>get </em>you or to daydream about the future without locking yourself into a plan yet. Just be mindful of mixed signals or vague commitments. You’re allowed to dream big this week, just don’t promise more than you’re ready to deliver. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, a conversation, realization, or idea is reaching a point where thinking about it is no longer enough. The week begins with the Leo Full Moon on February 1st, lighting up your communication, ideas, and day-to-day interactions. Expect a conversation, realization, or announcement that feels bigger than you anticipated. Something you’ve been thinking about for a while finally needs to be said, shared, or decided. The danger here is talking just to fill the silence or reacting emotionally before you’ve processed the full picture. Choose intention over impulse. Your words carry extra weight right now, so make sure they reflect what you actually mean. </p>



<p>On February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, activating your subconscious, intuition, and behind-the-scenes sector. This is less about external change and more about internal clarity. Insights may arrive in strange ways, dreams, random thoughts, or sudden emotional realizations that explain why you’ve been feeling restless or distracted lately. Instead of trying to logic your way through everything, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/women-intuition-gut-instinct-personal-safety"">trust what your intuition</a> is revealing. Something you’ve quietly outgrown becomes undeniable this week. </p>



<p>Mercury, your ruling planet, enters Pisces on February 6th, shifting your focus toward career, reputation, and long-term goals. The vibe becomes less linear and more imaginative. You may feel inspired about your future but slightly fuzzy on the details. That’s okay. This isn’t the moment to lock in a five-year plan. It’s about letting yourself envision what success could look like without immediately editing yourself. Just double-check emails and expectations. Mercury in Pisces prefers poetry over bullet points, and misunderstandings are easier if you’re not paying attention.  </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955474.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cancer, this week asks you to get honest about what feels truly secure versus what you’ve been holding onto out of habit. The week opens with the Leo Full Moon on February 1st, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2026-meaning-effects"">activating your money</a>, self-worth, and stability sector. As a moon-ruled sign, you’ll feel this one deeply. Emotions around finances, value, or what you’re giving versus receiving may rise to the surface. A purchase, payment, or realization could force you to ask, “Is this actually worth my energy?” The temptation is emotional spending or overreacting to temporary insecurity. The growth comes from recognizing how far you’ve come and choosing confidence over fear, even if things don’t feel perfectly settled yet. </p>



<p>On February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, bringing momentum to your friendship, community, and long-term goals sector. If social dynamics have felt unpredictable or exhausting over the past few months, this shift helps things stabilize in a new way. You may feel clearer about who belongs in your inner circle and which group spaces feel aligned with your future. Unexpected opportunities through friends or networks could also reappear, this time with more follow-through. Stay open, but don’t overcommit. You’re learning discernment, not withdrawal. </p>



<p>Mercury enters Pisces on February 6th, harmonizing beautifully with your Cancer energy. Your intuition sharpens, your imagination expands, and you may feel drawn to dream, plan, or reflect rather than act. Conversations take on a more emotional tone, and you may feel inspired to think about travel, education, or spiritual growth. Just be mindful of assumptions. Mercury in Pisces is poetic, but not always precise. Let yourself dream big this week, but keep one foot on solid ground. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, the spotlight is on you and the real question is whether you want to perform or actually be seen. This is <em>your </em>week, Leo, and it starts exactly how you’d expect with the Leo Full Moon on February 1st lighting up your identity, confidence, and “this is who I am now” sector. Emotions are big, visibility is unavoidable, and something about you comes into full view, whether that’s a personal decision, a creative reveal, or a moment where you realize you’ve outgrown an old version of yourself. The shadow here is overreacting or taking everything personally. Not every spotlight moment requires a dramatic speech. Sometimes the power move is quiet confidence. </p>



<p>Then on February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, shaking things up in your career and public image zone, but in a way that feels more intentional than chaotic. If work, reputation, or long-term goals have felt unpredictable, this shift brings clarity around what’s actually worth building. You may realize you want something diﬀerent than you did a year ago, or that success doesn’t need to look the way you were taught it should. Expect subtle momentum rather than instant results. The key is staying flexible instead of clinging to a title or plan just because it once felt secure. </p>



<p>As the weekend begins, Mercury enters Pisces, shifting your focus toward intimacy, trust, and emotional honesty. Conversations go deeper, feelings get softer, and you may crave connection over applause. This is a good time to talk about what’s <em>really </em>going on beneath the confidence, but be mindful of assumptions or mixed signals. Mercury in Pisces speaks in vibes, not bullet points. Let yourself feel without needing to define everything immediately. You don’t have to have all the answers this week. Being present is more than enough.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Virgo, the universe is quietly asking you to slow down long enough to notice what <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-intuition-gut-instinct-personal-safety"">your body and intuition</a> have been trying to say. The week begins with the Leo Full Moon on February 1st, lighting up your rest, healing, and subconscious sector. This is one of those Full Moons that doesn’t shout, it whispers… and then refuses to be ignored. You may feel more tired than usual, emotionally sensitive, or suddenly aware of something you’ve been pushing down. The temptation is to analyze the feeling away or stay busy to avoid it. The better move is rest. Seriously. Something needs closure, and clarity comes faster when you stop trying to control the process. </p>



<p>On February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, activating your expansion, learning, and belief sector. This brings forward momentum around plans involving travel, education, publishing, or a shift in perspective you’ve been circling for months. An idea that once felt too risky may now feel oddly doable. This isn’t about leaping without looking, but about trusting that growth doesn’t always come with a spreadsheet. Let curiosity guide you a little more than certainty this week. </p>



<p>As the weekend begins, Mercury, your ruling planet, enters Pisces, putting relationships and one-on-one dynamics into focus. Conversations feel more emotional and less linear, which can be… uncomfortable for you. You may need to read between the lines or sit with ambiguity instead of demanding immediate clarity. Misunderstandings are possible, but so is deeper connection. Listen with empathy, not just logic. This week reminds you that not everything needs fixing. Some things just need to be felt. </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Libra, this week reveals who and what actually belongs in the future you’re trying to build. The week kicks oﬀ with the Leo Full Moon on February 1st, spotlighting your friendships, community, and long-term goals. A social dynamic, group project, or vision for your future reaches a turning point, and you may suddenly feel clear about who’s actually aligned with where you’re headed. The temptation is people-pleasing or trying to keep everyone happy. The growth comes from choosing authenticity over harmony-for-harmony’s-sake. Not every bridge is meant to be maintained. </p>



<p>On February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, activating your intimacy, shared resources, and emotional depth sector. This brings a subtle but meaningful shift around trust, vulnerability, or finances tied to others. If certain emotional patterns or entanglements have felt unpredictable, this direct motion helps you regain balance and perspective. You’re less reactive and more grounded in what you’re willing to share and what you’re not. That clarity is powerful, even if it feels uncomfortable at first. </p>



<p>As the weekend kicks off, Mercury enters Pisces, turning your attention toward work, routines, and well-being. The vibe becomes softer and less structured, which may test your desire for balance and order. You may feel inspired to care for yourself in more intuitive ways, but it’s also easy to overcommit or blur boundaries. Be gentle with yourself. This is a week for adjusting rhythms, not perfecting them. Balance isn’t about doing everything, it’s about doing what actually supports you. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, are you ready for things to finally click in your professional life without you having to overly control the process? The week opens with the Leo Full Moon on February 1st, lighting up your career, reputation, and visibility sector. Something comes to a head professionally, recognition, a decision, or a moment where you realize how you’re being perceived. You may feel pressure to perform or to prove yourself, but the real question is whether the path you’re on actually feels aligned. The shadow here is overworking or staying quiet about your needs. The power move is owning your accomplishments <em>and </em>your boundaries. You don’t need to downplay your talents to stay in control. </p>



<p>On February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, shifting the energy in your partnership and one-on-one relationship sector. If dynamics with a partner, collaborator, or close friend have felt unpredictable, this direct motion brings a sense of recalibration. Not everything is suddenly stable, but you’re clearer about what you want and what you’re no longer willing to tolerate. Conversations may feel more honest, even if they’re a little uncomfortable. This is about progress, not perfection. </p>



<p>Then on Friday the 6th Mercury enters Pisces, harmonizing with your Scorpio energy and softening the pace. Creativity, romance, and emotional expression take center stage, and you may feel more open than usual about what you want and feel. This is a great time to reconnect with pleasure, play, or a passion project, but be mindful of mixed signals or idealizing situations too quickly. Let things unfold naturally. This week reminds you that intensity doesn’t always need armor. Sometimes it just needs space. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, are you ready to say yes to a bigger vision even if you don’t have all the details figured out yet? The Leo Full Moon on February 1st lights up your sector of growth, travel, learning, and belief systems, pushing a long-standing idea, plan, or desire to reach a moment of truth. You may feel inspired, restless, or eager to expand your world, but the shadow here is overpromising or assuming enthusiasm alone will carry you through. Let this Full Moon remind you that belief is powerful, but commitment is what makes it real. </p>



<p>On February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, bringing forward momentum in your work and daily routine sector. If your schedule, responsibilities, or job dynamics have felt inconsistent, this shift helps you regain traction. A new rhythm begins to form, one that asks you to work smarter, not harder. Small changes in how you manage your time or energy can have a big impact now. Stay flexible. The more open you are to doing things differently, the more freedom you actually gain.<strong> </strong></p>



<p>Then Mercury enters Pisces on February 6th, drawing your attention toward home, emotional grounding, and personal space. You may crave comfort, nostalgia, or quiet reflection after a mentally busy week. Conversations with family or about living situations may feel more emotional than logical, so listen carefully and avoid jumping to conclusions. This is a good moment to slow down, recharge, and let your intuition guide you. Not every adventure requires movement. Some growth happens when you let yourself settle. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, are you ready to stop carrying everything like it’s your personal responsibility to hold the world together? The Leo Full Moon on February 1st activates your intimacy, trust, and shared-resources sector, bringing a moment of truth around emotional or financial entanglements. This could look like a boundary conversation, a realization about power dynamics, or finally acknowledging where you’ve been over-giving. The shadow is shutting down or trying to control the outcome. The growth is letting yourself be supported without guilt. </p>



<p>On February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, energizing your creativity, joy, and self-expression sector. If you’ve felt blocked, uninspired, or hesitant to take a risk with something you love, momentum starts returning. This isn’t about reckless leaps, but about remembering that pleasure and play are not distractions from success. They’re fuel. Let yourself experiment without needing a perfect plan. </p>



<p>As the weekend hits, Mercury enters Pisces, softening your communication style and inviting more emotional nuance into conversations. You may find yourself speaking from the heart rather than the spreadsheet, which is a shift, but a healthy one. Just double-check details and expectations. Not everything needs to be finalized this week. Some ideas just need room to breathe. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, yes, this week is about you, but not in the way you’re used to. The Leo Full Moon on February 1st lights up your relationship sector, bringing clarity around partnerships, situationships, or close collaborations. Something reaches a peak, a decision, a realization, or an emotional moment you can’t intellectualize your way out of. The shadow is detachment or defensiveness. The lesson is presence. You don’t lose your independence by being emotionally available. </p>



<p>Then on February 3rd, Uranus, your modern ruler, stations direct in Taurus, shifting energy around home, family, and emotional foundations. Things that felt unstable or uncertain start making more sense, even if they’re still evolving. You may feel clearer about where you belong or what kind of support you actually need. This isn’t about locking things down. It’s about choosing stability on your own terms. </p>



<p>As Mercury enters Pisces on February 6th, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2026-meaning-effects"">your focus turns toward money</a>, values, and self-worth. Conversations around finances or priorities may feel less logical and more emotional. Trust your intuition, but don’t ignore practical details. This week asks you to align your values with your choices, not just your ideas. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, this week asks you to be honest about what’s draining you versus what’s actually sustaining you. The Leo Full Moon on February 1st illuminates your work, health, and daily routine sector, bringing a realization about habits, obligations, or responsibilities that need adjusting. You may feel called to do less, not more. The shadow is martyrdom. The growth is choosing yourself without needing permission. </p>



<p>On February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, bringing momentum to your communication, mindset, and learning sector. If conversations have felt stuck or plans unclear, things begin moving forward with more confidence. Ideas land diﬀerently now. You may feel more willing to speak up or share something you’ve been sitting on. Trust that your voice matters, even if it shakes a little. </p>



<p>As the weekend arrives, Mercury enters your sign, putting your thoughts, feelings, and intuition front and center. You’re more expressive, imaginative, and emotionally tuned in, but also more sensitive to tone and energy. This is a great time to journal, create, or talk things through with someone you trust. Just remember, not every feeling needs immediate action. Some insights unfold when you give them space. </p>
