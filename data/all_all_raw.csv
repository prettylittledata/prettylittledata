<p>The house is located in one of the villages near Warsaw, close to a river, surrounded by a gently sloping mixed forest. The owners say they bought it by accident when they met a real estate agent while walking their dog, who led them to a pyramid-like building hidden among the trees. It turned out to be an uninhabited residence, which the local militia commander had dreamed of owning. The building was constructed between 1976 and 1981 during a period of crisis and low availability of building materials. It was built from whatever could be obtained from construction sites and renovations of infrastructure facilities: for example, the ceilings were made of tram rails, which were laid at a slight slope above the ground floor, as they pierced through the outer wall and became part of the terrace structure. Thanks to its slight slope, the terrace was naturally drained. At the same time, the floor in the living room behind the wall had a noticeable slope, and the wall was blackened by the cold and moisture penetrating through the rails. The original construction documentation consisted of a few A4 pages with very sketchy drawings and one page of laconic description.</p>",

<p>Are living spaces getting smaller? As cities densify and the global population continues its steady migration toward urban centers—projected to reach around 70% by 2050—domestic space is becoming increasingly compressed. Rising land prices, high construction costs, and a surge in single-person households push developers toward smaller units and tighter floor plans. At the same time, cultural shifts toward resource efficiency and minimal living support this move. <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1020291/design-solutions-for-small-living-maximizing-space-in-apartments-under-40-square-meters"">Shrinking living spaces</a> require fewer materials, consume less energy, and encourage people to live closer to their means. </p>",

<p>Can academic projects explore new directions and contribute to public discourse on global and local issues? <em>The 2025 Politecnico di Torino <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/architecture"">Architecture</a> Students Award</em> aimed to address these questions, showcasing how architectural research, training, and experimentation can be integrated into a school curriculum.</p>",

<p>Cheng Tsung FENG's artistic practice has long been intertwined with endangered traditions, vanishing techniques, and fading cultural memories. Among them, the traditional bamboo theatre — once a vital part of temple festivals and folk celebrations across Taiwan — holds a special resonance. Built entirely with bamboo scaffolding, these temporary performance stages embodied the ingenuity of communities, combining practicality with ritual and festivity.</p>",

<p>THE KYEOL Clinic is conceived as a modern interpretation of Korean aesthetics, offering a calm and refined atmosphere through natural materials, restrained details, and a focus on spatial stillness. Located within a 58-pyeong (191 m²) interior, the clinic was designed for a client seeking a space that expresses Korean identity without relying on luxury or ornamentation. The site required a balance between functionality as a dermatology clinic and the brand's desire to create a serene, culturally rooted environment. The main challenge was to build a contemporary medical space that still conveyed traditional sensibilities while maintaining openness and simplicity.</p>",

<p>This tenant office building stands just steps from a subway station in the Ichibancho district of Tokyo's Chiyoda Ward—an area near the Imperial Palace (the former Edo Castle), steeped in history and culture. Conventional tenant office buildings generally house multiple companies within a single structure, yet their facades fail to reflect the diversity within. On top of this, they lack a sense of connection with the surrounding community and contribute little to the streetscape or the character of the local neighborhood. This project addresses these problems by creating a building that connects people to the surrounding urban environment while accommodating increasingly diverse work styles and values. To achieve this, two key architectural elements were incorporated: interior spaces defined by projecting bay windows and an open exterior space.</p>",

A thoughtful designer in an era of loud personalities… it’s a tidy version of him, and it’s true, but it leaves out important details that earn him a place in this series.</p><p>Madison spent his early career watching a country lose its footing. Under the Articles of Confederation, states behaved like independent rivals. New York taxed goods coming in from New Jersey. Virginia and Maryland fought over navigation rights. Each state was convinced it saw the situation correctly and expected the rest of the country to comply. Of course, it didn’t work that way, and what emerged instead was a tangled mess of competing systems that produced exactly the kind of chaos Madison feared.</p><figure><img alt=""Engraved illustration of Shays’ Rebellion showing armed state militia firing a volley in winter snow, with smoke rising from their muskets.

A small group of farmers in Massachusetts pushed the state close to collapse over debt policy. Madison noticed how little it took to shake the whole system, and that moment told him more about the country’s stability than any debate ever had.</p><p>He saw the same instability inside Virginia. Religious groups (Anglicans, Baptists, Presbyterians) each fought to define public life according to their own doctrine. Each new majority produced a new attempt to legislate ‘certainty’ (a topic we’ll tackle another day). It convinced Madison that no group, no matter how principled, can be trusted with the whole system.</p><p>These observations led to a very important insight:</p><p><strong>People don’t balance themselves. Their interests need to be balanced for them.</strong></p><p>His education was important in helping him articulate this.</p><ul><li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montesquieu""><strong>Montesquieu</strong></a> warned about <strong>concentrated power</strong>.</li><li><a href=""https://lawliberty.org/why-we-need-humes-wisdom-on-factions/""><strong>Hume</strong></a> explained why <strong>factions form and why they don’t disappear</strong>.</li><li>The <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/event/Scottish-Enlightenment""><strong>Scottish Enlightenment</strong> </a>taught him that <strong>complexity survives by</strong> <strong>distributing conflict rather than suppressing it</strong>.</li></ul><p>So Madison built a republic that relied on a balanced system.</p><ul><li>A large republic makes it harder for any one group to dominate.</li><li>Layered governments force negotiation instead of obedience.</li><li>Separate branches introduce friction (deliberate, sometimes frustrating friction) to keep hardline views from turning into authority.</li><li>Even procedural delays weren’t accidents; they acted as insulation.</li></ul><p>Building and planning for durability, however, meant he could build for unity.</p><p>And this is the part of Madison worth remembering: <strong>he understood that certainty is a destabilizer.</strong> Once a group believes it sees the whole picture, it stops feeling like it needs to listen. Once listening stops, balance goes with it. And after balance, legitimacy is a fast follow.</p><p>The system he designed survives because this heavy load is ‘distributed’. We only really notice his work when someone tries to remove that balance.</p><p>*Cough cough*</p><figure><img alt=""Smiling Elinor Ostrom with gray hair and glasses, wearing a brightly patterned red and multicolor top, standing against a solid orange background."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1cuc5roaBnJwiz2pf1bEew.png"" /><figcaption>Elinor Ostrom</figcaption></figure><h3>Elinor Ostrom: The proof that balance can be built</h3><p>Elinor Ostrom usually appears in the public imagination as the first woman to win the <a href=""https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2009/ostrom/facts/"">Nobel Prize in Economics</a>. She spent her career far from academic models and closer to the places where cooperation was something people needed in order to eat, drink, farm and survive.</p><p>Her research took her into forests in Nepal, irrigation systems in Spain, fishing communities in Turkey and water boards in Los Angeles. Each place had the same problem in a different scenery: a shared resource, a mix of competing interests and the constant possibility that one group might push its agenda far enough to throw everything off balance.</p><p><a href=""https://sesmad.dartmouth.edu/theories/54#:~:text=In%201990%20Elinor%20Ostrom%20published,Self%2DMonitoring%3B%20Self%20Sanctions%3B"">Ostrom watched closely at how these communities behaved.</a> She noticed that the systems that worked well weren’t run by a single leader or by a perfectly unified community. Instead, they relied on rules that spread responsibility across the people who depended on the resource(s). Boundaries were clear. Rules were shaped by the people who had to live with them. Monitoring was handled locally (because outsiders didn’t understand). Disputes were settled quickly and without big ceremony. And when conditions changed, the rules changed with them.</p><p>These were places built by people who understood imbalance because they felt it the moment it appeared. That’s the heart of Ostrom’s contribution: <strong>Balance works when it’s shaped by the people closest to the problem.</strong></p><p>She saw that when decision-makers were at a distance from the decisions they were making, they had a confidence they hadn’t earned. The closer they were to the problem, the more careful they were with the solution.</p><p>Ostrom also paid attention to the early signs that signaled a system was in trouble. For instance, if a single group found ways to steer the rules in its favor, and the system lost its ability to balance out. The worst failures happened when outsiders stepped in with a single fix and applied it everywhere. Solutions that looked great from a distance often unraveled the arrangements that had kept the community stable in the first place.</p><p>This is important and confirmed something Madison understood intuitively: balance doesn’t maintain itself. It has to be built. And it’s built best through local negotiation, small adjustments, and shared constraints that prevent any one perspective from becoming the entire truth.</p><p>For her, balance was more resilience than a moral posture. And the places she studied didn’t have the luxury of ignoring that. They depended on it.</p><figure><img alt=""Mahmood Mamdani with gray hair, glasses, and a short beard sits on an outdoor bench, smiling gently.

He saw that societies fall apart because people get sorted into identities so rigid that disagreement stops being part of politics and starts becoming the whole point of it.</p><p>His work in East Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East all circled the same problem: W<strong>hen politics harden around identity categories, balance becomes impossible. The categories do the thinking for you.</strong></p><p>What he found was more unsettling than ideological and was baked into the structure itself.</p><p>He showed how colonial administrations divided people into “natives” and “settlers,” assigning rights and responsibilities based on identity rather than citizenship. Once those categories were in place, everything that followed (representation, punishment, land access, even the definition of violence) was shaped by the category, not the behavior.</p><p><strong>The pattern was brutally consistent:</strong></p><ul><li>People stopped seeing each other as individuals and started treating each other as types.</li><li>Arguments became personal because they were tied to who someone <em>was</em>, not what they said or did.</li><li>And instead of working within the same rules, every group insisted its own view set the rules.</li></ul><p>Once a political system runs on identity rather than structure, the entire framework begins to tilt to one side. Laws formalize conflict rather than stabilize it and public life stops being about negotiation and becomes a contest to control the category that sits closest to power.</p><p>This is the core of Mamdani’s warning: <strong>once a group can define categories, it no longer needs to define the argument.</strong> The system starts carrying their weight for them.</p><p>Here are some of his examples:</p><ul><li>In Rwanda, colonial administrators turned fluid social identities into fixed racial categories, replacing political negotiation with inherited status. This was a shift that left the society permanently off-balance.</li><li>In Sudan, laws distinguished “tribes” in ways that reshaped land rights and obligations, guaranteeing that every political conflict would be read as ethnic rather than structural.</li><li>In Uganda, colonial policy created systems where citizenship and identity pulled in opposite directions, ensuring that no debate stayed a debate for long.</li></ul><p>Different places, same mechanics: C<strong>ertainty, hardened into identity becomes a destabilizer.</strong></p><p>And this is where Mamdani plugs directly into the argument I’m making.</p><ul><li>Madison feared the dominance of one single group.</li><li>Ostrom showed how to prevent it through shared rules and distributed responsibility.</li><li>Mamdani shows what happens when none of that holds true. When people collapse a complex political world into a few fixed categories and then defend those categories as if their survival depends on it.</li></ul><p>He explains the modern reflex where expanding someone’s frame feels like an attack. Nuance becomes betrayal, and balance? Well, that looks an awful lot like disloyalty.</p><p>I’m not saying people are unreasonable. I’m saying <strong>their political identity is doing too much work. </strong>Once that identity carries the whole argument, the whole thing starts to slide.</p><h3>Where All Three Collide</h3><p>You don’t need to be a political theorist to feel when a system is off-balance. People sense it in small ways before they can articulate it. A policy feels rushed. A rule changes too quickly. Decisions start to look engineered for someone else’s benefit.</p><p>What Madison understood, Ostrom proved, and Mamdani diagnosed is that imbalance isn’t dramatic… at first. It appears in places where one idea or one identity starts carrying more weight than it should. And once that happens, people react the same way they do when you widen their argument: they retreat into the part they understand and defend it like it’s the whole story.</p><p>You see this in every procedural fight we pretend is about ideology. Gerrymandering is a fight about boundaries. The filibuster is a fight about friction. Court expansions, emergency powers, rule changes, executive orders … each one chips away at the balances that were designed to slow certainty down.</p><p>What we don’t see is people panicking because of any specific outcome. The reason? Things change. Just wait a bit and balance should bring things back in order if it was a bad decision.</p><p>Don’t you think it’s interesting that panic actually comes from people reacting to systems when it’s those systems that feel like they’re being manipulated or unbalanced?</p><p>Madison would recognize the pattern immediately.<br />Ostrom would see the loss of shared constraint.<br />Mamdani would see identity doing more work than structure.</p><p>When a system becomes too easy to take advantage of, the people inside it start holding their positions tighter. Balance stops feeling like a responsibility and starts feeling like a betrayal. There’s an irony there that’s hard to miss.</p><p>The thing a plural society needs most is the first thing people abandon when they feel the least bit of instability.</p><p>And once identity becomes the primary way people organize themselves, even small adjustments feel like attacks. You’re not disagreeing with their idea; you’re threatening the category that idea is supposed to protect. The politics stops being about governance and becomes about defending a sense of self.</p><h3>Reflection</h3><p>This essay took me a while, but the longer I read about these three, the clearer the pattern becomes.</p><p>People cling to their ideas because the alternatives feel unsafe. Balance threatens certainty, and certainty is where people place their moral grounding.</p><p>But every system that survives (every republic, every community, every shared resource) survives for the same reason: it never lets one idea, one identity, or one group do all the work.</p><p>Madison designed for that.<br />Ostrom documented it.<br />Mamdani warns what happens when we lose it.</p><p>If the world feels louder or angrier than it used to, I don’t think it’s because we’re more divided. I think it’s because our desire for balance is getting weaker and it’s become a risk instead of a responsibility.</p><p>It doesn’t have to stay that way.</p><p>It just requires something we aren’t great at right now: looking at the bigger picture.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=b14effc622b4"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/when-one-idea-does-all-the-work-b14effc622b4"">When one idea does all the work</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Doing the right thing should be easy.</h4><figure><img alt=""Da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*APj-7duB_TuT3mOR.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man</figcaption></figure><p>Human engineering isn’t what you might think. It’s not a eugenic nightmare of bioengineering and gene selection. Thank goodness, it’s much more benign. Instead, human engineering is a multi-disciplinary field that brings together psychologists, engineers, cognitive scientists, organizational behavioral specialists, and designers. Their goal is to make it easy for people to do the right thing. [Redacted: High brow <em>“A Clockwork Orange” </em>joke] Sometimes referred to as interaction design or cognitive ergonomics, the aim of <a href=""https://www.dau.edu/glossary/human-engineering"">human engineering</a> is to improve human performance by looking at <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915002860"">systems</a>.</p><p>Simply put, human engineering tries to make it easier to do the right thing and harder to do the wrong thing for any task or activity. This aim is achieved through the design (and alteration of existing designs) of the technology, systems, and environments that individuals interact with. Immediately we see the application of human engineering into the paradigm of system dynamics and <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/the-architecture-of-human-error-ae69c732eb79"">human error</a>.</p><p>There are many principles of human engineering, but one of the most important is the importance of designing the interactions of humans and objects to <a href=""https://medium.com/@adnanmasood/human-compatible-engineering-value-alignment-in-artificial-intelligence-3ebb39222104"">align function with action</a>. To demonstrate, consider the very common scenario of turning on a burner on the kitchen stove.</p><h4>The Mysterious Case of the Wrong Burner</h4><p>Has it ever happened that you’ve gone to turn on the stove and lit the wrong burner? It’s not just you. It’s a very common problem and one of the most studied topics in the field of human engineering. Stoves are not advanced technology and lighting the stove only requires one turn of the knob. So how come we’re so prone to these simple mistakes?</p><p>The answer has to do with the way the alignment of form and function. Stovetops are tremendously bad at this alignment. Consider two popular configurations of commercial stoves:</p><figure><img alt=""Two stovetop configurations. One with knobs grouped, the other with them evenly spaced and linear."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/466/0*W7NsBm1XLq4jfD-G.png"" /><figcaption>Source: Design of Everyday Things</figcaption></figure><p>In typical stove designs (let’s call them Configuration A and Configuration B), we see that the burners are aligned as a 2x2 rectangle, whereas the knobs are aligned linearly along the front. The knobs and the burners are configured differently. To use a technical term, we could say that these configurations have poor <a href=""https://uxplanet.org/designing-for-spatial-ux-in-ar-vr-a-beginner-to-advanced-guide-to-immersive-interface-design-c55f092deb0b?gi=debcdfcae8a8"">spatial compatibility</a>.</p><p>Configuration B is slightly better than Configuration A, because there is a natural grouping between the two burners and knobs on the left and the two burners and knobs on the right. Nevertheless, in this configuration errors will be common and proper use will rely on reading the labels on the knobs or trial and error. In short, it takes some level of cognitive effort, beyond intuition to ensure consistent proper use of the stove.</p><h4>The Better Way</h4><p>Now consider two slightly different configurations. In Configuration C the burners are still arranged in a 2x2 rectangle, but now, the knobs are also arranged in a similar way. There is a natural alignment between the controls and the device. No labels are needed.</p><figure><img alt=""Two (different) stovetop configurations. One forming a dimaond the other an arch shape"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/457/0*RxPGxuDmbpJLxyB2.png"" /><figcaption>Source: Design of Everyday Things</figcaption></figure><p>Configuration D provides another natural and intuitive layout, but this time maintains the linear arrangement of the knobs. Simply by bringing the two back burners closer together to align with the knobs, the stovetop has gone from an inscrutable, error-prone appliance to something that is intuitive and easy to use.</p><p>Without objection, we can see why the stovetop configurations in Configuration C and Configuration D are better. Not only will these configurations produce fewer errors and lead to more consistent and effective operation of the stove but they also rely on intuition and require less cognitive processing to achieve the greater result! A win-win!</p><p>Oh by the way, how much did the change cost? We used the same space, the same controls, and the same materials. We can decrease errors, build resiliency, and decrease the cognitive load without sizable investments! Win-Win-Win!</p><h4>The Principle of Spatial Compatibility</h4><p>What we’ve just witnessed is the principle of <strong>spatial compatibility </strong>in action. This principle states that controls should be arranged to correspond naturally with the devices they control. When there’s a clear, intuitive mapping between control and function, people simply know what to do. No thinking required. No labels needed. No errors made.</p><p>This might seem obvious when pointed out, but look around your environment. How many poorly designed interfaces do you interact with daily? How many times do you have to stop and think about which button does what? How often do you make “simple mistakes” that are actually design failures?</p><p>The stove example illustrates a profound truth:<strong> </strong><a href=""https://www.visualexpert.com/Resources/humanvsdesignerror.html""><strong>most of what we attribute to human error is actually design error</strong></a><strong>. </strong>We blame ourselves for our mistakes when we should be blaming the systems we’re forced to work within.</p><h4>When Design Betrays You</h4><p>Stovetops are not the only place where we encounter human engineering in our daily lives. Even something as simple as a door can pose significant challenges to human-technology interaction (Yes, a door is technology). We’ve all been in that embarrassing situation where we push a door that should’ve been pulled and vice versa. But have you ever stopped to ask why you made an error? Take solace in knowing that it was the door’s fault and not your own.</p><p>These doors did you wrong. They betrayed you. They gave a signal that was incorrect, and your only fault was that you trusted them. Who knew that doors could be so deceitful? Take heart, this is a very common problem. One person who this has happened to a lot is <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/don-norman?srsltid=AfmBOop_maSfXFhLO5D93jNZZmHJpS8CVHLz0C-TGvc5aMKE9f66dhEk"">Don Norman</a>. Don knows a lot about these sorts of doors. Don has studied these doors so much that these species of doors are actually called “Norman Doors.”</p><p>In his book “<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654"">The Design of Everyday Things</a>” he explains:</p><blockquote><em>“How can such a simple thing as a door be so confusing? A door would seem to be about as simple a device as possible. There is not much you can do to a door: you can open it or shut it…The design of the door should indicate how to work it without the needs of signs or trial and error.”</em></blockquote><h4>The Principle of Discoverability</h4><p>The chief way these doors betray the user is by abandoning another fundamental and important design principle, the principle of <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/discoverability?srsltid=AfmBOoqcveYvH3s_TDQKAhmw5xqskniMY4RXp_QEpwXDtVGn9s-Pr4yW"">discoverability</a>. The principle of discoverability simply states that any designed object should make it clear to the user how to correctly use that object. In the case of the Norman door, not only did the door make it unclear, but it probably sent the exact opposite signal than what was required.</p><p>Consider a door with a horizontal push bar on it. That bar screams “PUSH ME!” to anyone who sees it. It’s a clear affordance — a visual cue about how the object should be used. Now imagine that same door with a “PULL” sign on it. The sign contradicts everything the door is telling you with its design. The horizontal bar is still there, still suggesting you should push, but now you’re supposed to ignore that signal and pull instead.</p><figure><img alt=""An example of a Norman door. A horizontal bar with a “Pull” label"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*sw9GFNd08qM_ojY8.png"" /><figcaption>A Norman Door. Source: 99percentinvisible.org</figcaption></figure><p>This is fundamentally bad design. A well-designed pull door should have a vertical handle that you can grip. A well-designed push door should have a flat plate or push bar. The design itself should communicate the proper use without requiring any labels or explanations.</p><h4>Why This Matters More Than You Think</h4><p>The Norman door is an important example of human engineering in daily life because it showcases how the alignment of human action and the environment impacts our propensity to make mistakes. If something as simple, ordinary, and untechnical as a door can impact the decisions, efficiency, and productivity of individuals than how much more will this be true for complex systems.</p><p>Indeed, the inefficiencies of these everyday objects may seem trivial and insignificant but the underlying principles they demonstrate are anything but, especially when applied to industry. What these vignettes demonstrate is important and powerful. Using the same space and the same equipment for the stove, we nearly <a href=""https://asq.org/quality-resources/mistake-proofing?srsltid=AfmBOoovPTOqO74WKlYiOk5XOyz1QlaFdxyiu7kEPCBfftUkOWoouHvx"">eliminated the possibility for error</a>. No rework, no guess and check, no errors, no need for labels, less thinking, no need to stop and think about the result of our actions and all for no money.</p><p>Human engineering is potent and powerful.</p><h4>The Core Principles of Human Engineering</h4><p>While there are many principles of human engineering, several stand out as particularly important for designing better systems:</p><p><strong>1. Spatial Compatibility:</strong> Controls should be arranged to naturally correspond with the things they control. The layout should be intuitive and obvious.</p><p><strong>2. Discoverability:</strong> The design should clearly communicate how something is meant to be used. Users shouldn’t have to guess or rely on labels and instructions.</p><p><strong>3. Feedback:</strong> The system should provide clear, immediate feedback about what’s happening. When you press a button, something should happen that confirms your action was received.</p><p><strong>4. Constraints:</strong> Good design constrains behavior in ways that prevent errors. If something can only be done one way, and that way is the correct way, errors become impossible.</p><p><strong>5. Mapping:</strong> There should be a clear relationship between controls and their effects. Natural mappings leverage existing knowledge and expectations. (I even created <a href=""http://sixsigma-consulting.com/tetris"">a fun Tetris game</a> you can to play to demonstrate this principle)</p><p><strong>6. Affordances:</strong> The design should suggest its own use. A handle affords pulling. A button affords pressing. A flat surface affords pushing.</p><h4>The Human-Centered Design Philosophy</h4><p>At its core, human engineering embodies a fundamental philosophy: when a person makes an error while using a system, it’s the system that failed, not the person. This perspective shift is revolutionary. Instead of training people harder, writing more procedures, or adding more warnings, we redesign the system so that errors become difficult or impossible to make.</p><p>This doesn’t mean humans are absolved of all responsibility. It means we recognize the reality of human limitations and capabilities, and we design accordingly. We accept that people will be distracted, tired, stressed, and forgetful. We acknowledge that people will sometimes be in a hurry, sometimes be interrupted, sometimes misremember.</p><p>Rather than fighting against human nature, human engineering works with it. Rather than demanding superhuman perfection, it creates systems where ordinary human performance is sufficient for excellent results.</p><h4>The Cognitive Load Consideration</h4><p>One of the most important benefits of good human engineering is the reduction of cognitive load. Every poorly designed interface, every ambiguous control, every unclear instruction adds to the mental burden people must carry. When you have to stop and think about which burner is which, or whether to push or pull a door, you’re <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/cognitive-load/"">using cognitive resources that could be applied elsewhere</a>.</p><p>Good design frees up mental capacity. It allows you to focus on what matters rather than wrestling with interfaces. It reduces <a href=""https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/decision-fatigue"">decision fatigue</a>. It makes the right choice the obvious choice, the easy choice, the path of least resistance.</p><p>Think about how exhausting it is to navigate a poorly designed website, a confusing form, or a cluttered workspace. Now think about how effortless it is to use a well-designed tool. That difference, that feeling of friction versus flow, is human engineering in action.</p><h4>Application Beyond Physical Objects</h4><p>While we’ve focused on physical examples like stoves and doors, human engineering principles apply to every system you interact with:</p><ul><li><strong>Digital interfaces:</strong> Are your most-used apps and tools intuitive, or do they require constant mental translation?</li><li><strong>Work processes:</strong> Do your workflows naturally guide you toward the right actions, or do they create opportunities for confusion?</li><li><strong>Personal routines:</strong> Are your habits supported by environmental design, or do they require constant willpower to maintain?</li><li><strong>Communication systems:</strong> Do your methods of staying informed and responsive flow naturally, or do they create constant friction?</li></ul><figure><img alt=""A man’s hand inserting a card into an ATM"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*mvMu1gqWP7PHccug.jpg"" /><figcaption>A pime example of good work processes, ATMs require you to take your card before your cash, making it unlikely you error (forget your card) Source: bankrate.com/</figcaption></figure><p>In each of these domains, the principles remain the same. Make the right thing easy. Make the wrong thing hard. Provide clear feedback. Create natural mappings. Reduce cognitive load.</p><h4>The Power of Environmental Design</h4><p>Human engineering reminds us that we don’t need to become better people to perform better. We need to create better systems. We don’t need more discipline, more willpower, more training. We need environments that support us rather than fight us.</p><p>This is liberating. It means improvement doesn’t require becoming someone you’re not. It requires thoughtfully designing the systems and environments you operate within. It means recognizing that when you consistently make the same “mistake,” it’s probably not your fault — it’s a design failure waiting to be fixed.</p><p>The question isn’t “How can I be more careful?” The question is “How can I redesign this system so being careful isn’t necessary?”</p><p>That’s the promise and power of human engineering.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=65e59d9ac6d8"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/human-engineering-65e59d9ac6d8"">Human engineering</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

So much of it feels infested with ads, deceptive design patterns or erosions of privacy all engineered to squeeze every last drop of engagement out of our already overstimulated grey matter. So as a contrast, I thought it’d be worth remembering that not all technology follows this trajectory.</p><p>At this point, many of us have grown so accustomed to terrible treatment from our tech providers that we mistake it for the natural order of things. I wrote an article last week about <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-evolution-of-youtube-how-every-platform-evolves-into-an-ad-machine-9e6032ff2d20"">YouTube’s slow shift from serving users to serving advertisers</a>, and someone commented: “Sadly, as long as the internet is largely ‘free,’ then there will always be ads. Always 🫠🫠🫠.” And while I get the feeling. Sometimes it really feels like we’re like travellers stuck in an airport terminal, forced to accept whatever fate awaits us, because there’s nowhere else to go. But there are more examples than you’d think of technology that has stayed open, portable, and most importantly put people over profit!</p><p>I’ll be sharing the stories of three of my favourites: Blender, OBS, and Penpot. One uniting thread across all these apps is these tools were built out of necessity, born from frustration, and carried forward by creators who wanted something better for <strong>themselves</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>others</strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""Blender render with logo overtop"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RDRKc_1TAwV2H_tsT5buQQ.png"" /><figcaption>Blender render with logo overtop</figcaption></figure><p>Blender, for those who don’t know, is an open-source 3D modeling and animation tool currently sitting near the tipy top of its category. It’s used by world-class VFX studios all over the world and, as of 2020, had over <a href=""https://www.blender.org/news/blender-by-the-numbers-2020/"">14 million downloads</a>, a number that continues to grow year over year. It’s an incredibly successful project and believe it or not you don’t have to pay the low-price of $12.99 a month to get a subscription to it. There’s no hidden upsell, no temporary trial access, no marketing funnel to trap you in. It is free, fully open source, and wickedly powerful.</p><p><a href=""https://www.blender.org/about/history/"">Blender was originally created in the early ’90s</a> inside a Dutch animation studio called NeoGeo. It began as an internal tool, something practical that made life easier for the artists who worked there. After the studio went belly up, Blender’s creator, Ton Roosendaal, tried to keep the project alive through a startup called Not a Number (NaN). He roped in some investors, made a splash, and then the dot-com bubble popped and evaporated the funding and stopped Blender in its tracks.</p><p>The tool was effectively locked away: trapped in the hands of investors, sitting unnoticed in a folder full of failed acquisitions gathering dust in some corporate archive alongside other abandoned experiments. That very well could’ve been the end of the story, but its creator Ton had seen the impact the tool had on the community. He knew what it meant for artists to have access to something this capable without needing to pay. So he did something wild at the time, he launched a campaign to buy Blender back from corporate limbo. Remember, this is pre kickstarter, grassroots tech funding movements weren’t all the rage. He needed 100,000 euros to reclaim the rights and release it from corporate exile.</p><p>Armed with a mailing list and a landing page he mobilized the community. Artists, hobbyists, students, tinkerers all threw a coin in the hat and in just seven weeks, he raised the entire amount. A regular ol’ Bernie-Sanders-style grassroots fundraiser. Blender was released as fully open-source software under the GNU license, and the <a href=""https://www.blender.org/about/foundation/"">Blender Foundation</a> was born, a nonprofit stewarding a public tool.</p><p>Today, Blender is funded through a donation-driven development fund supported by companies<a href=""https://fund.blender.org/""> like Ubisoft, Meta, NVIDIA</a>, and thousands of individuals who believe in its mission. It remains one of the clearest examples we have of community-driven, people first software.</p><p>Another thing I found, across all these stories is that somewhere at the centre, there’s usually a quietly stubborn technical weirdo holding the line, resisting the gravitational pull of the cash-out. That’s certainly the case with OBS. For those who aren’t familiar, OBS is best-in-class when it comes to live-streaming. If you’ve ever watched a livestream, you’ve almost certainly seen OBS in action. And the “lowly technical saint” who built it goes by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBS_Studio"">Hugh “Jim” Bailey</a>. His aim wasn’t to create the most widely used tool for streamers, it was to try and build something better for himself so he could stream <em>StarCraft II</em>… That’s it. Just a programmer trying to share a game he loved.</p><figure><img alt=""OBS interface and logo"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*HcW7fzPPxfYS1sSP"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.downloadsource.net/how-to-reset-the-obs-interface-reset-the-obs-ui/n/23048/"">OBS interface and logo</a></figcaption></figure><p>But that’s what matters, oftentimes we forget that the DNA of the people who build these tools infuses into the technology. There’s a weird Frankenstein effect when it comes to technology. In my opinion, understanding who stitched the monster together often helps you understand how a tool ends up the way it does. I find that this is perfectly illustrated by Spotify. It presents itself as a music company, but its founders <a href=""https://soundiiz.com/blog/who-are-daniel-ek-and-martin-lorentzon-spotifys-founders/""><strong>Daniel Ek</strong>, who sold his ad-tech company <strong>Advertigo</strong> to TradeDoubler, and <strong>Martin Lorentzon</strong>, the co-founder of <strong>TradeDoubler</strong>,</a> one of Europe’s largest online advertising networks. They were not record crate-diggers or historians of music. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnXwkh2Vg54"">They were ad-tech entrepreneurs looking for a scalable payload for programmatic advertising</a>, and music simply happened to be the cheapest, most convenient content vehicle. <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/spotify-has-an-ai-problem-a4d6729c715b"">Spotify is what you get when you pour ad-tech DNA into a music platform.</a></p><p><a href=""https://gamingcareers.com/podcasts/creating-obs-interview-with-jim/"">When Jim Bailey released OBS, he spent the first three years answering every forum post, every bug report, every direct message</a>. He was in the trenches with the people using his tool. He saw the struggles of beginners. He saw the streamers who depended on OBS to earn an income or build a community. And because he was so close to the people using the software, he never once saw them as assets. He saw them as peers.</p><p>So when OBS exploded in popularity and Jim started receiving acquisition offers in the <strong>seven-figure range</strong>, he didn’t acquiesce. He thought about what it means to hand his <strong>peers</strong>, millions of them, to people who probably didn’t care about them the way he did. Jim is not a public figure, so finding quotes from him is rare, but in a podcast he did with <a href=""https://gamingcareers.com/podcasts/creating-obs-interview-with-jim/"">Pete Wilkins on the <em>Gaming Careers</em> show</a>, he put it plainly in two quotes that I love:</p><blockquote><a href=""https://gamingcareers.com/podcasts/creating-obs-interview-with-jim/"">“They don’t necessarily want your program — they want the users. And it’s hard to put a price on your users like that.”</a></blockquote><p>and the succinct, but dripping with his ethos:</p><blockquote><a href=""https://gamingcareers.com/podcasts/creating-obs-interview-with-jim/"">“I don’t need a yacht.”</a></blockquote><p>This was clearly not a financially “smart” move. Today, OBS is maintained by a tiny core team and a smattering of volunteer contributors. OBS remained open not because it was easy, but because its creator refused to sell the people who depended on it.</p><p>The last example I want to touch should be near and dear to the heart of every product designer. <a href=""https://penpot.app/"">Penpot</a>! Penpot was created by a company called Kaleidos, a decade-old studio that originally operated as a kind of elite technical/research partner for hire. Their full name <em>Kaleidos Open Source</em> reflected a very real internal philosophy: they only used open-source tools, they built for their clients using open-source tools, and they carved out protected time to create their own open software.</p><figure><img alt=""Penpot logo surrounded by UI graphics"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/690/0*UIB6QyIvTW2q5snR.jpeg"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://community.penpot.app/t/its-time-for-penpot-to-almost-move-away-from-the-dom/6437"">Penpot logo surrounded by UI graphics</a></figcaption></figure><p>For years, Kaleidos was a developer-centric team. They outsourced most of the design work, and that worked fine, until one day they had to hire their first internal designers. That’s when their philosophy came face to face with reality. While developers frolic in an open-source oasis, designers were stuck with a collection of janky, slow, unpolished tools that barely, and I mean <strong>barely</strong> met professional standards. The truth was the design team simply didn’t have open-source equivalents of the quality that developers took for granted. So while the designers loved the ethos, the tools just weren’t good enough and they needed Figma. So Kaleidos conceded. They broke their own rule. But they broke it with a single condition:</p><blockquote><a href=""https://possiblefutures.tech/posts/interview-with-penpot-ceo-pablo-ruiz-muzquiz-on-open-source-design-and-ethical-funding"">“We’ll use Figma… but while we use it, we’ll build the Figma killer.” Pablo Ruiz-Múzquiz</a>, founder of Penpot &amp; Kaleidos</blockquote><p>And that is how <a href=""https://possiblefutures.tech/posts/interview-with-penpot-ceo-pablo-ruiz-muzquiz-on-open-source-design-and-ethical-funding"">Penpot was born</a>! Early versions were rough, but Penpot has come a long way in just a few years. And since its release in February of 2021, Kaleidos fully committed to just working on their own tools and shut down their client-services business entirely!</p><p>They call themselves the Figma Killer because they’re an ambition team. Though maybe not the ambition we think of when we picture ambitious people. Not the Machiavellian business man dressed to the nines, stepping out of some expensive sports car working their way up a corporate ladder to give an inspiring talk at some conference full of suits. This is a different ambition, a moral ambition, which drives companies like Kaleidos to build products that put the power of tools into people’s hands. It’s hard to imagine being in a position of building a tool that you put blood sweat and tears into and not wanting the greatest remuneration possible, but the reason that all three of these founders are able to do it is because their ambition isn’t monetary, it’s about <strong>impact</strong>. They want people to feel like they have autonomy and are empowered.</p><p>When you step back from these stories: Blender, OBS, Penpot all show a pattern. They didn’t become popular because of market positioning or manipulative growth and monetization strategies. They became what they are because the people behind them had values that were strong enough to resist selling out their users.</p><p>Each of these tools carries the fingerprint of its creator’s worldview. Software is not neutral. It inherits the values of the people who make it. We treat platform decay as inevitable. But I think that inevitability story favours the people making the choice of profit over people.</p><p>And that’s why these three examples matter so much. They remind us that it is still possible, even now, even in this tech climate to build software rooted in generosity, openness, and respect. To build tools that don’t treat users like resources to mine and exist because someone cared more about enabling others rather than maximizing returns. We need more of that kind of ambition.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3985d97f3b23"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/when-software-has-integrity-3985d97f3b23"">When software has integrity</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Great ideas arrive on their own time. The design stroll is an easy framework for capturing them when they do.</h4><figure><img alt=""Two cartoon diamonds walking down a street holding hands"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GSQ6tkvnHslyZNmIzCGbSQ.png"" /><figcaption>Illustration by Liam Oscar Thurston</figcaption></figure><p>Through all the changes I’ve seen in design throughout my career, there has been one constant: Everyone always wants you to go faster. To (maybe) quote Benjamin Franklin, “time is money”. A lot of designers are happy to trot out the old “<a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/the-big-lie-of-good-fast-cheap-fb8905818250"">Good/Fast/Cheap: Choose 2</a>” diagram, bitterly complaining that no one ultimately picks “good” among the options. But failing to keep up is an existential threat. If you can’t design in time, then it’ll be an engineer, or a VP, or an AI agent that will.</p><figure><img alt=""A Venn diagram showing the overlap between good, fast, and cheap"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/1*AzquVdt_kEV2er75dKFjwg.png"" /><figcaption>I made this diagram quickly and cheaply. As a result, it kind of sucks.</figcaption></figure><p>As someone who reacts viscerally to bad design, I tend to lean a tad towards stubborn when it comes to quality. This means I spend altogether too much time thinking about ways to do design, at quality, quickly. It’s part of the reason <a href=""https://medium.com/loblaw-digital/designing-a-design-system-for-loblaw-digital-a-magical-mystery-tour-37d0b9764601"">I like design systems so much</a>. And while I’m the first person to raise an eyebrow at the latest productivity/ creativity/ diet/ life-hack, I’ve come to recognize something about how I work, and how I assume others do too. I’ve found that my next great idea has rarely arrived on time, or on theme, or during set “creative” opportunities. Instead, they’ve come when I’m knee deep in the work, inside those fabled flow states people talk about where you can “see the matrix” or whatever.</p><p>Being in that state, and having the idea, only to just shrug it off seemed ultimately annoying, and it got me thinking about how it might be possible to pause for a moment, and actually chase that idea down. How would you capture it, and manage your commitments? What steps would you take? Taking a page from Albert Hofmann, I decided to experiment on myself, and ran my very own personal “design stroll”, a playbook for designers to switch gears when the metaphorical lightbulb switched on. In the wake of some success, and a real sense of motivation, I sought to formalize the process, and in doing so I learned about exactly why I found it to be so effective.</p><p>It’s occurred to me that inside of every company, there’s probably someone with a great idea, just sitting on it, for lack of time, motivation, or really anything else. They’re the people who understand the problem best, but maybe they’ve never had the chance (or the permission) to solve it.</p><p>So if you’re a leader, a designer, or a leader of designers, this is my gift to you. The <em>design stroll</em> is a way to catch those great ideas, when they come, still keep your teams going, and motivate your best minds to keep bringing their best to the table. No need to thank me. Just mail me a cheque for 10%.</p><h3>Born to… stroll?</h3><p>The design world already has its go-to go-fast technique, the <a href=""https://www.thesprintbook.com/the-design-sprint""><em>design sprint</em></a>. It’s a 5-day, all-in workshop that pulls the best ideas a team has, focuses on one good one, and works to produce an artefact that can be tested with users by the sprint’s end. When done right, design sprints are an effective way to solve or ideate around a big decision, or even a new product.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*idYxgMivtwIC48RV1n1BSw.png"" /><figcaption>The Design Sprint, from <a href=""https://www.thesprintbook.com/the-design-sprint"">TheSprintBook.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>Design sprints themselves are carefully designed, building on the principles set out by <a href=""https://designthinking.ideo.com/"">IDEO’s “Design Thinking” process</a>. Significant effort by the architects of the sprint went to mitigating specific drawbacks of open-room brainstorming. Namely, that collective workshops suffer from groupthink, bias consensus, and give preference to the ideas of the most senior person in the room (conspicuously it’s not shocking that leaders like doing them). So the design sprint carves out time for individual ideation, anonymizes voting up ideas, and attempts to put everyone on the same page at the start, something Knapp et al call a “beginner’s mindset”.</p><p>But good intentions often suffer from bad practices. In reality, teams aren’t truly afforded the entire time free from commitments, so people drop in and out, often leaving specific team members with the required expertise (designers and or engineers) to manifest and test the artefacts. Success in articulating and defending ideas still hinge on your communication skills, likability, and role in the organization, and since “beginners” lack the nuance inherent in the problems you’re solving, they tend to favour ambitious solutions that an expert would disregard based on a deeper understanding (this is called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect"">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>, where non-experts tend to rate their expertise as greater than the experts rank themselves, ie: you don’t know what you don’t know).</p><p>Did your sprint come up with an app that would do everything? That means you’ve failed. This was just a team building exercise. <strong>If the design process could operate this quickly, wouldn’t we just sprint all the time?</strong></p><figure><img alt=""A still from the simpsons episode featuring Homer inside the car he designed"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/495/1*J4Z5vva4aMCeFdyxLRRpbw.png"" /><figcaption>The outcome of too many design sprints looks like “the Homer” (Copyright FOX)</figcaption></figure><p>By contrast the d<em>esign stroll</em> (a play on design sprint, if that was not abundantly clear) goes all in on two things; <strong>individual effort</strong>, and <strong>expertise</strong>. A <em>design stroll</em> is conducted by a single expert, and realizes an idea or solution from a single perspective. No compromises. That idea gets a shot at being fully expressed before the weight of the group comes to bear. The designer/solver gets their chance at being an auteur. What’s your <em>Citizen Kane</em>?</p><h3>Stroll this way:</h3><p>You can break the whole process down into a few phases;</p><p>1 Business as usual<br />2. The Lightbulb Moment<br />3. Making it real|<br />4. Show n’ Tell</p><p><strong>Business as usual<br /></strong>Imagine that you’re a designer*, working on any given product, knocking things off a prioritized roadmap, doing your best to meld business needs with customer wants. You spend your days thinking about that product, and you understand it really well. Inevitably, (and maybe regrettably) you find that those thoughts aren’t confined to the 9–5. Your brain’s still working in the background when you’re on transit, grocery shopping, lying in bed at night.</p><p><strong>The Lightbulb Moment</strong><br />Pablo Picasso once said “Inspiration does exist, but it must find you working”. And so here, in the midst of your work, something will inevitably happen. You’ll have an idea. Maybe it’s a solution to a specific problem you’re facing, but it could also be an approach, enhancement, or even something that’s on the periphery of the work you do. It’s up to you to determine whether that idea’s worth pursuing. The best ideas for strolls are what you might call “inside the box” thinking. That doesn’t mean they’re boring, just that they’re constrained. It’s probably not the way to go about re-imagining fundamental value propositions, or blocking out the chapters for your first novel. The best strolls ideas are “what-if” moments that could actually happen.</p><p><strong>Making it Real<br /></strong>Instead of putting this idea into a Notes page you’ll only dig up when you’re trying to think of the name of that restaurant where you had that parmesan ice cream sandwich that one time, you’re going to want to prove out your idea. You might not even know fully how you’ll bring it to life just yet, or all the edge cases that might present themselves, but you won’t know until you try. Herein is the hardest part of the entire <em>design stroll</em>– taking the time needed to flesh out your idea. More on this later.</p><p>You shouldn’t attempt anything you can’t bring to life in a few days. Remember that you’re proving the concept, not shipping it. You’re also working from your lone perspective, the director of your own little film. That doesn’t mean you can’t engage a colleague who’s an ace at prototyping, or a copywriting superstar to help you deliver the best version.</p><p>Your output could be a prototype, a vibe-coded demo, or even a well-structured storyboard. You’re bringing your idea to life so that others can understand it, and that’s really all that’s important.</p><p><strong>Show n’ Tell</strong><br />By now you’ve created something that does the job of demonstrating the general sense of your idea. Now it’s time to get it out into the world. You’ll have to show people not only how it works, but what value it has. A design crit is a great place to start. If the signals are good, find ways to socialize this with your cross functional partners. Get some feedback. Maybe hold off on emailing it to the CEO. The point of the work you’ve done is to start a conversation.</p><p><em>*really you don’t have to be a designer to do this, just anyone deeply involved and invested in your work.</em></p><h3>The Man who Strolled the World</h3><p>If you’re skeptical, you’re paying attention. Not everyone has the luxury of just stopping their work to chase down an idea. Before you go anywhere, you need permission. Timing’s important. So is managing your workload. It’s important to communicate. A stroll conversation should work like this:</p><p><em>Hey ______, I’ve got a great idea to _________________. Can I spend a few days putting something together to show you what I mean? (Then explain the design stroll, or link them to this article.)</em></p><p>That’s essentially how I pitched my very first “stroll” to my design leader at the time. I’d had a revelation about how we might allow our customers to both perceive and obtain value across our e-commerce platforms. Normally this is an idea I’d just shelve and grumble about, but not this time. Across a span of about four days I put my head down, declined any meetings I could, and put together a demo. I didn’t do it alone. I reviewed it with a skilled visual designer, I conscripted another– a prototyping ace– to help me bring things up to a very narrow, polished expression of my solution. I worked through a few takes of a video walkthrough (one which was going perfectly until the fire alarm went off). I sent the video around to a few sympathetic peers, and then sent it up the chain.</p><figure><img alt=""Two screens from an ecommerce app that show how to complete deals in cart"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jSq9OfmieSDZeF9q1IOxuw.png"" /><figcaption>One of a number of screens I produced in my “value vision” stroll. (Copyright Loblaw)</figcaption></figure><p>To be clear, it’s not like the business hit the emergency stop and pivoted to action on my idea. Nor did I expect it to. What it did do was frame important conversations about value initiatives for the year ahead, and helped to illustrate some important ideas and considerations so folks across functions could align. A few quarters have passed, and pulling things from my initial stroll concepts into my work. Better yet, I’m seeing the work referenced by other folks in the organization to bring planning documents to life.</p><h3>Stroll Lotta Love</h3><p>There are a number of real reasons why I think the <em>design stroll</em> is an effective tool. To explore why, you need to know a little bit about how good ideas form.</p><p>It was Thomas Edison who supposedly said “great ideas originate in the muscles”. With 1093 US patents to his name, Edison isn’t some gilded-age Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson. He means that good ideas come from doing, and not from passively being struck with inspiration. The mental image of someone deep in thought being struck by inspiration, doesn’t really happen. This is the <em>design stroll’</em>s environment, in the muscles, waist deep in doing. That’s where ideas are found.</p><p>In his not-subtly named book, <a href=""https://stevenberlinjohnson.com/where-good-ideas-come-from-763bb8957069""><em>Where good ideas come from</em></a>, Steven Johnson talks about the concept of the “long hunch”, where a vague idea about something slowly forms in someone’s mind over an extended period of time. Eventually through exposure to the problem itself, or the thoughts of others, those hunches combine into a great idea. For Johnson,</p><blockquote>“Sustaining the slow hunch is less a matter of perspiration than of cultivation. You give the hunch enough nourishment to keep it growing, and plant it in fertile soil, where its roots can make new connections. And then you give it time to bloom.”(78)</blockquote><p>Long hunches feed the <em>design stroll</em>. On the occasion when one hunch crashes into another and makes a good idea, it’s time for the <em>design stroll</em> to begin.</p><p>For Daniel Kahneman, author of <a href=""https://dn790002.ca.archive.org/0/items/DanielKahnemanThinkingFastAndSlow/Daniel%20Kahneman-Thinking%2C%20Fast%20and%20Slow%20%20.pdf""><em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em></a>, there are two (metaphorical) systems of thinking. System 1, which is automatic and intuitive, and System 2, which is more effortful and logical. When it comes to ideation, the two systems interact, taking System 1’s creative “aha” moments and putting them into practice in practical ways with System 2. Kahneman also stresses that System 1 thinking often relies on bias, and that fundamentally humans aren’t very good at being right when it comes to intuitive guesses, because we’re so easily swayed by things around us. Fast thinking (System 1) makes it easy for someone to focus on the wrong thing, with Kahneman suggesting that “when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution”. (12)</p><p>Here’s where the stroll shines. A stroll lets you wait for the right time to take action. We’ve all been in a situation where we’ve been presented with a problem, and without much thinking, answered it, only to have our response quickly put on the scrap heap. “Yeah. We tried that, and no.” That was your overconfident System 1 talking. The <em>design stroll</em> gives System 1 and 2 time to battle it out, and that means that the solution is much higher quality than the one you’d have if you’d been thrown onto a team during a hackathon, etc.</p><p>Even the creators of the sprint, Jake Knapp &amp; co. acknowledge the facts. In contemplating why (pre-sprint) brainstorming sessions weren’t working, they write:</p><blockquote>“Individuals were still thinking up ideas the same ways they always had– while sitting at their desks, or waiting at a coffee shop, or taking a shower. Those individual ideas were better.” (Sprint, 2)</blockquote><p>The stroll is centred around individual contribution, and it puts individual perspectives to the test before they get shot down. How many times have you had an idea that you just couldn’t communicate well enough to show folks the bigger picture? The stroll is laser-focused on cultivating these ideas so they aren’t lost, missed, or ignored.</p><h3>Stroll with it</h3><p>If you’re a design leader, or really anyone with any influence on process, you’d do well to carve out time for your experts to pounce on an idea when they have it. Someone on your team or in your organization probably has an amazing, well-thought out, money-making/saving, feasible idea that you haven’t heard about. Maybe because you haven’t asked. Make the time and space for ideas to be developed when they strike, and never let another good idea go unspoken again. Not every stroll will be the next big idea. <strong>Some might be small good ones.</strong></p><p>Implementing strolls in your practice is really about making space in two ways, granting permission, and providing a forum to socialize what gets produced. Designers need to know that they can take time to explore solutions that aren’t on a roadmap. They need trust in the use of the time, and their teams need to make space to enable them, or even assist them if they need it. A good idea no one sees is about as loud as a tree falling in the forest with no one around. It’s important to create forums for stroll ideas to be both heard and understood, by those who can facilitate bringing them to life.</p><p>In the absolute worst case, you’ve lost a few productive hours and energized your team creatively. Giving permission to ideate outside of the confines of work, and listening –if nothing else–provides motivation and a sense of meaning in one’s work (in case you haven’t heard, there’s a bit of a <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/a-crisis-of-meaning-in-ux-design-0831b85a3fb5"">crisis of meaning in design at the moment</a>). Better motivation, better satisfaction, better productivity. It’s a win-win-win. So If you want to find good ideas, find those who are in the work, and when solutions come, let them out for a stroll.</p><p><em>Thanks for reading.

<p>For most of us, winter is when <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">creativity stalls</a>. Shorter days, darker nights, and sub-zero temperatures don’t exactly fuel the imagination. But the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fall-2025-nail-manicure-trends"">nail artists</a> of the world seem unfazed by the winter blues, using the chilliest season as a springboard for their <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/argyle-sweater-nails-manicure-trend"">coolest designs</a>.</p>



<p>This month alone, we’ve spotted cranberry chrome — both block color <em>and</em> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/deep-french-tips-nails-manicure-trend"">French tips</a> — plus nails drenched in so much glitter they resemble the inside of a snowglobe. </p>

<p>Thanks to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DOj62CbDHoi/?hl=en"">nail artist Grethel</a>, traditional tortoiseshell nails have had an upgrade just in time for the holidays.

<p>These split ombré nails are like an optical illusion, evoking the shadowy winter moon. We especially love the gradient, which seamlessly blends midnight and baby blue. Nail artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DQ4h7-_j_5m/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Brittney Ellen</a> explains that the ombré is flipped on the French tip to trick the eye.</p>

Warrant’s “Cherry Pie”, The Runaways’ “Cherry Bomb”, Hozier’s “Cherry Wine”... There’s a reason why so many artists — spanning decades and genres — are inspired by one commonplace fruit. On the one hand, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tiktok-cherry-cola-lips-trend-hack"">cherries</a> represent the simple sweetness of youth and capture the heady nostalgia of long summer days (life is but a bowl of cherries, after all). On the other hand, they’re shorthand for sex, seduction, and a loss of innocence (think the sultry lyrics of Lana Del Rey or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUtDwWp17tM""><em>Twin Peaks’ </em>Audrey Horne</a> tying a cherry stem with her tongue). <br /><br />In the art world, cherries are symbolic of wealth and decadence. The <a href=""https://arthive.com/publications/316~Life_is_just_a_bowl_of_cherries_Top_10_paintings_rendering_cherries#google_vignette"">Dutch Old Masters</a> couldn’t get enough of them in their elaborate still lifes, spilling out of ornate silver dishes with bouquets. The same can be said for cherry fragrances. A cherry note is never just one thing — it can be sweet and succulent, bright and tart, or deep and indulgent. Whatever it’s mixed with can also completely change the game, whether that’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/oakcha-perfume-dupes-review"">rich ouds, boozes and spices</a>, earthy leather and wood notes, florals, or other fruits. <br /><br />Thanks to this versatility and complexity, cherry fragrances have long been topping ‘viral fragrance’ lists (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/trending-perfume-fragrance-2024"">especially our own</a>).

I wore it to a fancy dinner date with my fiancé and felt so confident and beautiful all night. (The right perfume can totally transform your mood and energy.)

This smells like the last heady days of summer: heatwaves, eating fresh cherries on the lawn, woodsmoke in the air from distant barbecues, and listening to Lana Del Rey on repeat. Lovefest Burning Cherry is heady and sweet without being cloying or sickly thanks to the spicy, warm, woody base of palo santo, patchouli, and guaiac wood, and fresh, fruity top notes of cherry and raspberry. It’s definitely the sexiest fragrance in my arsenal and my go-to when I want to boost my confidence.

Sadly, this is neither nutritious nor cost-effective, so failing that, I want to smell like them. This fragrance hits the nail on the head at first spritz. Like those luminous red cherries, it’s zingy, sweet, and moreish, and smells exactly like a maraschino-steeped cocktail. The issue with most cherry perfumes, though, is that the zinginess doesn’t last too long. However, that’s not entirely a bad thing. This dries down to something sweet and delicate — like hints of cherry with subtle florals. The staying power is impressive for a high-street perfume at this price; I could still smell it on my wrists hours later but it lasts much longer on clothes. Thanks to its lightness I think this would make for a better spring scent. I want something deeper and more brooding for fall and winter.

To me, this is a delectable cherry cocktail in perfume form. Up top, you have the first sip of black cherry and cherry liqueur, which makes way for the rich and intoxicating mix of bitter almond, warm vanilla, roasted tonka bean, and cinnamon. As such, it’s less of a straight cherry perfume compared to some others on this list, and perhaps not the one for you if you want that long-lasting cherry scent following you all day.

You can immediately catch the juicy cherry upon the first spray, but it quickly transforms from a fruity gourmand to a sensual floral, thanks to notes of jasmine and orange blossoms. It then develops into something muskier after drying down, with the base notes of vanilla and patchouli warming up my skin. This is also when the sweet whiffs of coffee beans emerge. It smells nothing like the medicinal cherry flavoring you get in your cough syrup as a child, but rather, a bold gourmand fragrance that has several interesting identities.

Alongside the cherry, there are sweet florals, vanilla, then amber and woodsy notes for balance. I adore a fragrance that balances femininity with earthy grit — to me, that is what makes it sexy and sophisticated. The catch? Usually, these kinds of scents wear full-bodied on me, so I was expecting this to come with a powerful throw based on first impressions. Cherry Ambition, however, turns to a gentler, near-skin scent after a couple of hours of wear. I don’t mind that, though; it makes it appropriate for everyday settings, like an office, rather than being a fragrance I’d save purely for the nighttime. Another thing to note is how stunning the packaging is. I love how on the back of the bottle you get a recommendation as to what the fragrance is best for: “Feeling brave, igniting ambition, making a statement”. I might not manage to feel these things every day, but a few sprays of this on my neck and wrists bring me a step closer.” <em>— Tanyel Mustafa</em><br /><br /><strong>The 7 Virtues</strong> Cherry Ambition Eau de Parfum 50ml, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP508411"">Sephora</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1970"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11776635.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=1970&amp;height=1970&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1970"" /><figcaption><strong><h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fcreed-carmina-eau-de-parfum%2F7561368"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Creed Carmina Eau de Parfum</a>, $310</h2></strong><br /><br />“Forget everything you think you know about cherry perfumes. This wonderfully complex scent from The House of Creed is so much more than that. Yes, you can catch a whiff of dark cherries in the opening note, but overall, it reminds me more of an expensive, artfully put-together bouquet. The breaths of rose de mai, violet, and peonies are so vivid that this might not be your kind of scent if you’re not into florals. I happen to absolutely love how this intensely feminine scent fills the room. It makes me feel so sultry and grown up, like I’m wandering around in a slinky velvet gown.

Just like your skin fresh out of the shower, this is definitely one of those ‘your skin but better scents’.

<p>When I was an eager intern, drafted in to clean out a magazine’s burgeoning beauty cupboard, my then manager gave me a piece of advice that would stay with me: “If nothing else, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/drunk-elephant-therabu-hand-cream-review"">look after your hands</a> and feet.” She was convinced that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-simple-skincare-routine"">12-step skincare routines</a> were overrated (a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-cleanser-face-wash-oily-skin"">simple cleanser</a>, moisturizer <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/spf-sunscreen-benefits-fall-winter"">and sunscreen</a> will often suffice). But considering how much we put our hands <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/05/10967072/podiatrist-pedicure-tips-for-soft-feet"">and feet</a> through daily, she always drove home how important it is to show them a little extra TLC when possible. </p>



<p>Since then, I’ve tried my best to follow her example, though it’s difficult for someone with perpetually <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/02/10853165/how-to-stop-hands-aging-steps"">parched hands</a>, further exacerbated by cold weather and heating. Over the years, I’ve also learned that not all hand creams are created equal. Most are sticky and don’t bode well for phone screens; others sting (a no-go for chapped knuckles), and some are so thin they don’t do much at all. </p>



<p>Keen to find the “Goldilocks” of hand creams — essentially the one that ticks all of my boxes — I made it my mission to try as many products down to the very last drop over the winter. Some of these hand creams have been recommended by top dermatologists, while others have gone so viral on TikTok that I couldn’t resist trying them out. Fast forward to this month, and I think I might’ve found the cream of the crop. </p>



<p>Without further ado, read ahead for my honest thoughts on $195 worth of hand creams.</p>

<p>Last year, I was lucky enough to go skincare shopping in Paris with<a href=""https://justinehextall.co.uk/justine""> dermatologist Dr. Justine Hextall</a>. There were probably a hundred hand creams lining the shelves of the French pharmacies we visited, but she picked out this fragrance-free version for my very dry skin. Dr. Hextall encouraged me to slather on a generous amount before bed and to pull on a pair of cotton gloves (you could also use a pair of socks!), kind of like a makeshift overnight hand mask. I saw the best results when I used this consistently. It’s all down to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sunday-riley-b3-nice-niacinamide-serum-review"">hydrating niacinamide</a>, skin-smoothing shea butter, and a whopping 30% <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-is-glycerin"">glycerin, a humectant</a>, which draws moisture into the skin. Thanks to dimethicone, a type of silicone, it makes hands feel silky rather than sticky, but it’s quite thick in texture and takes a moment to absorb fully. I ran out of the 50ml version too quickly, so I’d recommend spending a little bit more on the 100ml tube.  </p>

<p>I have to get one gripe out of the way first: The packaging might be “spillproof,” but it isn’t user-friendly. You have to give this a good squeeze to release the lotion, and even then, it’s pretty difficult to get much out. I’m not the only one. Countless reviewers say the same, and when your hands are feeling sore, that’s the last thing you need. Packaging aside, I love the chic scent (that’ll be creamy jasmine, zippy lemon, and comforting cashmere wood), and the cream softens tight, dry hands without a hint of slipperiness.</p>

<p>This is a hand cream first and an aromatherapy treatment second — it smells incredible. A few essential oils are behind the soothing scent, so it’s not something I’d recommend for those with very sore or chapped hands in case of irritation, but it’s still high up on my list. That’s because it boasts moisturizing glycerin, softening shea butter, and nourishing castor oil — three ingredients that breathe life into my dry, ashy hands. Don’t let that fool you into thinking it’ll leave you with greasy fingertips, though. My hands drink it up quickly, and it’s become my favorite hand cream for on-the-go top-ups. As you can probably tell by the state of this tube, it’s a purse staple.</p>

<p>I’ve been through multiple tubs of CeraVe’s Moisturizing Cream over the years, but it’s too big to carry around with me. Enter: Reparative Hand Cream. It features the same skin-strengthening ceramides, which act like glue in between skin cells to keep the skin barrier intact and moisture under lock and key. It sinks in fast, too. I looked to this when my hands were cracked and sore, and it helped to heal them quickly, but I found that I needed to layer up throughout the day. Still, it’s more or less traceless — and fragrance-free — so that didn’t bother me. I just need it to come in a bigger tube. </p>

<p>In the past couple of months, I’ve been through two 150ml tubes of this hand cream; nothing else has eradicated my dry skin quite like it. The star ingredients are 20% shea butter, which moisturizes deeply, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/beta-glucan-skincare-benefits"">beta-glucan</a>, which experts are championing as the new, more hydrating hyaluronic acid.

L’Occitane promises eight hours of intense hydration — and I believe it. I apply this before bed, and when I wake up, my hands look brand new. Even when I wash my hands after using it, they’re still unbelievably soft. Seeing as it’s substantially quenching, it takes about a minute for my hands to soak it up properly, but it works a treat. Dry skin? Don’t know her. This is my number one. </p>

<p>This absorbs easily and is packed with skin-repairing ceramides, moisturizing glycerin, and quenching shea butter — but it’s pricier than other hand creams on this list with very similar properties. For me, the main selling point is that I can use my phone or laptop almost immediately, and because it’s formulated without perfume, it doesn’t tingle or sting when applied to broken skin. I also like that you can squeeze every last drop out of the aluminum tube. It’s certainly chic, so if you have more to spend, why not? </p>

<p>If it’s instant relief you’re after, Aveeno has got you covered. This takes all of 30 seconds to disappear into dry hands (I counted), doesn’t leave behind any greasy residue, and makes rough skin feel much softer thanks to moisturizing glycerin and cushiony dimethicone. While it does the job, my dry hands require regular applications throughout the day, especially after washing. All in all, it makes a great desk hand cream for frequent typers. </p>

<p>I thought this hand cream would be all smell, no substance, but I’m very happy to be proven wrong. With coconut oil, squalane, and sodium hyaluronate (a type of hyaluronic acid), it’s considerably moisturizing and melted into my dry hands almost instantly. For those familiar with the brand’s viral Cheirosa ’62 fragrance, this hand cream is equally as beachy and sunscreen-y in smell, and the perfume lingered on my skin for a good while — even after I washed my hands. I keep this on my desk at home for a mid-afternoon pick-me-up. (It might be a little too potent for the office…)</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11943891.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>It’s official: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">we’ve entered Sagittarius Season</a> in full force, and with that comes a collective vibe shift that’s both undeniable and kind of a cosmic whiplash. We’re saying bye to the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Fixed water Scorpio Season</a>, with its secrecy, shadow work, and “let me spiral in peace” emotional intensity. In its place? The boundless optimism, reckless  honesty, and restless wanderlust of Mutable Fire for the next four weeks.  </p>



<p>Sagittarius Season isn’t here to make you sit with your feelings… it’s here to make you book a one-way ticket to <em>anywhere else</em> and sprint toward the next philosophical adventure. And yet, this fiery shift doesn’t mean we can  escape our responsibilities. It just means we’re <em>less afraid to face them</em>. From the way we communicate to how we reimagine our future, this is the week where bold moves feel less scary and more inevitable. </p>



<p>But don’t let the Jupiterian vibes fool you, this week also marks the end of a sobering  cosmic chapter. After 4.5 months of retrograde motion, Saturn, the Planet of  Responsibility, shifts direct in Pisces on November 27th, for the last time in this sign for the next 29 years. That’s huge. For many of us, Saturn in Pisces has been about emotional boundaries, intuitive discipline, and learning how to structure our dreams without suffocating them. As it stations direct, there’s a final karmic checkpoint: did you  learn how to trust your inner compass, or are you still outsourcing your intuition?  </p>



<p>Add to that Mercury’s direct station in Scorpio on the 29th at 12:38 p.m. EST, and we’re closing the month with both of our major “slow down and process” planets now moving forward in <em>Water signs </em>— even as fire sign season is heating up. The result? An internal green light, but with a caution label. You’ve gotten the downloads, the reroutes, the delays. You’ve had to pause and pivot more times than you’d like. This week? You’ll start to understand <em>why</em>. And with that clarity comes momentum… slow, steady,  intentional momentum that actually lasts. </p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, you’re feeling the flames again. After a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">deeply introspective Scorpio Season</a>,  Sagittarius Season enters like a spontaneous road trip invitation. Suddenly, the shadows make sense, the storylines connect, and the lessons you learned are becoming launchpads for expansion. This is your exploring cycle, but Jupiter (the ruler of Sag Season) is still retrograde in Cancer in your sector of home, family, and roots. That means you’re feeling the pull to go big, yes, but with a tender undertone. You’re  not running away from where you come from; you’re seeking experiences that remind you who you are at your core. Honor the desire to dream wider, but check in with your inner child as you do. </p>



<p>This week also marks the end of Saturn’s retrograde in Pisces in your sector of  spirituality, healing, and closure. For four and a half months, Saturn has been silently schooling you on what it means to actually rest, to release, to retreat without guilt. Now that Saturn’s finally moving forward, so are you, and whether you’re aware of it or not, this has been a key rehearsal period for what’s ahead. In early 2026, Saturn will re-enter your sign, meaning you’re next. This week is a subtle spiritual graduation: you’ve passed some behind-the-scenes tests, you’ve gotten stronger through surrender. Start  noticing the ways you’ve outgrown old fears, habits, or identities without needing anyone’s permission to evolve. </p>



<p>By the time Mercury shifts direct in Scorpio on the 29th, you’ll feel an energetic exhale in your sector of shared resources, intimacy, and psychological depth. Money hiccups, trust wounds, and communication delays within your closest bonds may have been peaking throughout November. But now the fog lifts. Mercury’s direct motion signals clarity, even if it arrives in whispers rather than fireworks. Consider this week your moment of truth — a time to reassess your energetic investments, reclaim your power, and close out the month with financial and emotional sovereignty. You’ve earned it. </p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, you’ve been moving through a portal, and this week, you’re emerging from the  other side with wisdom that’s equal parts sobering and sacred. Sagittarius Season  activates your sector of death, rebirth, transformation, and merging. Translation? The phoenix within you is rising. After Scorpio Season forced you to confront your  relationships — romantic, business, and everything in between —Sagittarius Season dares you to ask: <em>What parts of myself am I willing to shed so I can finally fly free? </em>This is not surface-level growth. It’s soul-level metamorphosis.  </p>



<p>And since Jupiter, the ruler of this season, is still retrograde in Cancer (in your communication and thought-patterns sector), you may be feeling a mix of breakthroughs and nostalgia, especially around the stories you tell yourself. Let them shift. Let your inner narrator evolve too. </p>



<p>Saturn, the Planet of Responsibility, is also ending its retrograde in Pisces on the 27th, after four and a half months retrograde in your sector of social networks, tech, and collective dreams. If you’ve felt distance between you and your community, or you’ve questioned whether your goals even <em>matter </em>anymore, that fog is beginning to clear.  Saturn’s been showing you where to recommit and where to walk away. Now that it’s direct, you can start building again, but this time with discernment and vision. It’s a brilliant time to reassess your relationship to visibility, collaboration, and long-term  purpose. You don’t have to do it alone, Taurus. But you <em>do </em>have to choose alignment over convenience. </p>



<p>Two days later, Mercury shifts direct in Scorpio in your sector of marriage. After a month of cosmic curveballs, miscommunications, or shifts in partnerships (romantic or professional), this retrograde finally comes to a close. You’ve likely had to clarify your boundaries or renegotiate your agreements, and now the pieces are falling into place. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, this week feels like your season of “choose your character” has officially begun. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Sagittarius Season lights up</a> your sector of partnerships and contracts — both the romantic kind and the cosmic, soul-contract kind. You’re magnetizing new people and drawing clearer lines with others. It’s delicious, chaotic, and clarifying. But since  Sagittarius is your opposite sign, it’s also activating some growing pains. Jupiter, Sag’s ruler, is still retrograde in your money and self-worth sector, so some of the connections or opportunities showing up now may have roots in old stories around value, security, or financial independence. Don’t rush to say yes just to be liked or chosen. Your time, your body, your love — those are sacred currencies. Invest wisely. </p>



<p>Now let’s talk about Saturn ending its retrograde in Pisces in your sector of reputation  and legacy. After months of questioning your path, wondering if your work is “enough” or if you’re even <em>seen</em>, the tide is finally shifting. Saturn’s retrograde has been humbling. You’ve probably wrestled with imposter syndrome, restructured your ambitions, or asked yourself: <em>What kind of impact do I really want to leave behind? </em>This week marks a subtle but powerful new chapter. You’re being invited to lead differently — not louder,  not harder, but deeper. Let your vision mature. It doesn’t have to be perfect; it just has to be real. </p>



<p>And then there’s your ruler Mercury shifting direct in Scorpio in your sector of wellness, service, and daily rhythms. November may have brought scheduling nightmares, health  wake-up calls, or moments where you forgot how to speak kindly to yourself. Now, balance is returning. You’re remembering how good it feels to have a flow that honors your mind <em>and </em>your nervous system. Consider this week your reset button. You’re not a  productivity machine — you’re a multidimensional, brilliant being learning how to make space for rest, rituals, and joy. Let Mercury’s direct motion be your permission slip to slow down <em>and </em>still get things done. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, the sun is now in Sagittarius, igniting your sector of health for the next four weeks and you’re in your <em>“I’m rebuilding my life like it’s a cozy Pinterest board” </em>era. But  don’t get it twisted: this is spiritual decluttering. Sag Season doesn’t just ask you to “clean your space,” it wants you to clean your <em>mind</em>. You’re craving systems that support your growth without boxing you in. And with Jupiter retrograde in your sign right now, this week could feel like a cosmic reminder that your energy is precious and sacred — not to be scattered. The answers aren’t outside of you; they’re within your own body, in the cues it gives when something’s aligned… or not. </p>



<p>Saturn also stations direct in Pisces this week in your sector of higher education and long-term vision. You’ve been going through it quietly, huh? Maybe questioning your beliefs, your purpose, your faith. Maybe realizing that outgrowing old ideologies is grief work too. But now Saturn’s ready to move forward, and so are you. A new kind of truth is settling into your bones. One you earned through patience, humility, and the courage to begin again. This is a powerful time to recommit to your path, whether that’s a new spiritual practice, a travel plan, or a long-forgotten dream that still makes your heart beat faster. </p>



<p>To round it out, on the 29th Mercury finally ends its retrograde in Scorpio in your sector of creativity, play, and romantic expression. If November had you in a funk creatively or made you question your romantic instincts, you’re not alone. Now, the fog clears and you’re reconnecting with your muses — the ones that remind you life is meant to be felt, not managed. Love letters, dance breaks, flirty texts, solo adventures: this is your  medicine now. Mercury direct reminds you that joy isn’t a distraction from your purpose. It <em>is </em>your purpose. Sprinkle that magic everywhere you go. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, now that the sun (your ruler) is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">officially in Sagittarius</a>, your cosmic confidence is back online — and not a moment too soon. Scorpio Season may have humbled you (okay, dragged you), but this fire-on-fire moment feels like you’re finally glowing again. The Sag sun lights up your sector of creativity, pleasure, and romance, so flirt with fate, play with possibility, and don’t be afraid to risk looking ridiculous. You’re in a luckier,  lighter window, even with Jupiter retrograde in your career and legacy zone reminding  you to realign with your long-term purpose before rushing forward. Trust that you don’t  need to have it all figured out to take a leap of faith… just enough courage to follow what feels fun and aligned. </p>



<p>And as if that weren’t enough cosmic momentum, on the 27th Saturn in Pisces is stationing direct in your intimacy and emotional merging sector after a long retrograde that had you questioning who’s safe to let in. Now you’re clearer on your boundaries and what kind of soul ties actually nourish your spirit (hint: not trauma bonds). Around the 29th, Mercury retrograde in Scorpio ends in your home and roots sector, helping clear the fog around family dynamics, housing plans, or internal safety. Conversations about cohabitation, inheritance, or emotional truth may finally start flowing again. November ends with insight, closure, and a heart that’s ready to trust its beat again.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, this is your quarterly “let’s romanticize my healing journey” update. The sun in  Sagittarius now illuminates your sector of home, family, and foundation for the next  four weeks, asking: where do I feel safe to be my full, messy self? Scorpio Season taught you how to say what you mean, but now Sag Season teaches you how to let yourself be <em>held </em>while saying it. Even if <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter retrograde in Cancer</a> has been delaying  clarity in love or close connections, you’re being asked to trust the bigger divine timeline. Your peace is sacred, not negotiable. Even in the chaos, create a home within yourself. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Saturn stations direct in Pisces in your partnership zone on the 27th,  bringing major lessons (and possibly reconnections) in how you show up in your  bonds. What patterns have you matured out of? What emotional labor are you no longer available for? You’ve grown into someone who doesn’t mistake consistency for intimacy. And as your ruler Mercury stations direct in your communication sector two days later, the mental fog lifts. The misunderstandings, missed texts, and tech chaos that dominated early November will start to unravel. Use this week to get grounded before December launches you into a faster pace; the seeds you plant now will  blossom in the new year. </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, welcome to the wide-open skies of Sagittarius Season. After weeks of deep  emotional inventory and existential shedding, this Fire sign shift energizes your sector of communication, curiosity, and creative expression. You may feel more extroverted  again — like you’ve finally caught your breath after swimming through Scorpio’s intense waters. The Sag Sun gives you the green light to speak up, share boldly, and  explore new ideas, especially ones that have been whispering to you from the edges of your comfort zone. That said, Jupiter retrograde reminds you to pace yourself — if you say yes to everything, you’ll burn out before December even starts. </p>



<p>Saturn in Pisces ending its retrograde in your sector of health, habits, and service on the 27th is also a game changer. The past four and a half months have shown you where your boundaries need fortifying, especially around time, energy, and what you give to others versus what you keep for yourself. Now that Saturn’s no longer in review  mode, your efforts to create structure will feel more supported by the universe. And with Mercury in Scorpio shifting direct in your income and self-worth sector on the 29th, money convos, business plans, and confidence levels begin to stabilize. Trust that delays were protection, and your next steps are much clearer now. Clarity and charisma — your favorite combo — are making a comeback.</p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, you’ve made it. You’ve swum through the underworld of your own psyche and  you’re emerging renewed. While Sagittarius Season shifts the collective’s attention  outward, you’re still integrating the deep truths that Scorpio Season unearthed —  especially with Mercury still retracing your sign until it stations direct on the 29th. The  Sag Sun now highlights your value systems, money mindset, and self-esteem for the next four weeks.  </p>



<p>This first full week of Sag Season is a chance to check in with your relationship to worth — not just financial, but emotional, energetic, and spiritual. And since Jupiter’s retrograde is still moving through your expansion and belief sector, you’re being called to ask: what stories are still shaping how you show up in the world? And do they still serve you? </p>



<p>Meanwhile, on the 27th Saturn in Pisces’ direct motion in your sector of pleasure, dating, and creative flow helps you anchor into your joy with more maturity and  discernment. You’ve had to learn — sometimes the hard way — that just because something feels good doesn’t mean it’s <em>right</em>. But now you’re clearer about what kind of pleasure truly nourishes you.  </p>



<p>With Mercury stationing direct in your sign on the 29th, your voice gets stronger, your words land with more weight, and your ability to self-advocate returns. You’re closing out November feeling more embodied and self-assured than you’ve felt all year. It’s giving “rebirth in real time”, and you deserve every ounce of this glow. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, it’s your time — <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Sagittarius Season has officially arrived!</a> This first full week of your solar return season feels like coming home to yourself. But this year’s kickoff isn’t a sprint — it’s a fiery slow burn. With your ruler Jupiter still retrograde in Cancer, your sector of emotional intimacy and legacy is activated, inviting you to move with  more care, more depth, more intention. You’re used to flying by the seat of your pants, but the universe is reminding you that some of your greatest expansion comes from digging <em>inward </em>before soaring outward. Don’t rush the glow-up… let it smolder. That  balance of Fire and Water is your true key this week. </p>



<p>Now that Saturn is finally direct in your communication sector (starting the 27th) after four and a half months of testing your boundaries, your voice is stronger, your inner compass clearer. The fog around decision-making starts to lift, and when Mercury in Scorpio stations direct in your closure sector on the 29th, you’ll be able to finally release what’s been weighing on your subconscious. End-of-the-month clarity hits different when your birthday’s around the corner. You’re not just moving forward, you’re moving wisely. Give thanks for the lessons, but don’t pack them in your suitcase.  You’ve got new roads to ride. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, Sagittarius Season activates your sector of spirituality and closure for the next four weeks — a sacred zone of soul whispers and psychic integration. This first  full week of the season is not about running full speed ahead. Instead, it’s your cosmic permission slip to unplug, reflect, and wrap up what Scorpio Season helped you  confront emotionally. With Jupiter (the ruler of Sag Season) still retrograde in your partnership sector, any themes around giving too much or receiving too little are ripe for review. Be real with yourself: what relationships feel reciprocal, and what are you still keeping alive out of guilt or habit? </p>



<p>The big cosmic win this week? On the 27th Saturn, your ruling planet, finally shifts direct in Pisces, ending a four-and-a-half-month stretch of delays in your communication and boundary-setting sector. You’ve been working behind the scenes to say what you mean, mean what you say, and still hold space with grace. Now, your words land with clarity and power, especially as Mercury in Scorpio stations direct in  your social and friendship sector on the 29th. Group dynamics get smoother, and  miscommunications resolve. As November closes, you’re realigning your circle, your truth, and your focus. Don’t worry, Capricorn, you haven’t missed the train. You were <em>building </em>the right track. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, welcome to the first full week of Sagittarius Season, igniting your sector of  community, collaboration, and future dreams for the next four weeks. You’re feeling pulled toward your people and your <em>purpose</em>. But don’t forget: Jupiter’s still retrograde in your wellness and routine sector, encouraging you to slow down, restructure, and <em>listen </em>to your body’s cues. Just because the vibe is social doesn’t mean you have to overextend yourself. Be discerning, and protect your peace while still aligning with the collective vision you’re here to lead. You’ve got global goals but sustainable impact starts with internal stability. </p>



<p>This week’s astro-reset is <em>potent</em>: on the 27th your ruler Saturn finally stations direct in Pisces, in your financial and self-worth sector, after months of deep reflection and constraint. What have you learned about your resources, both tangible and emotional? You’ve been quietly leveling up your self-respect, and now it’s time to own that growth. And as Mercury ends its retrograde in Scorpio on the 29th, your career sector starts flowing again. That pitch, launch, or major conversation that’s been delayed? It’s now divinely timed. End the month with bold clarity and remember: your <em>uniqueness </em>is your currency. Cash in accordingly. </p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, Sagittarius Season fires up your sector of career, public image, and long-term  purpose for the next four weeks. You’re being called to boldly take up more space and yet, Jupiter (your planetary ruler) is retrograde in your creative sector, tugging at your inner world, reminding you not to abandon your soul’s poetry in pursuit of performance.  Balance is everything. This week, let your ambition and your artistry walk hand in hand. You’re not just building a legacy, you’re channeling magic into the material world. Trust your process, and don’t rush the reveal. You’re still mid-metamorphosis. </p>



<p>The real shift this week? Saturn ends its four-and-a-half-month retrograde in your sign (the final retrograde in Pisces for the next 29 years) — and that’s huge. You’ve been carrying invisible weights, navigating initiations only your spirit fully understands. Now, the fog begins to clear. You know who you are and what you will (and won’t) tolerate. With Mercury stationing direct in Scorpio on the 29th, your expansion and exploration  sector starts to click back into gear. Book the trip, start the class, write the pitch. You’re closing November with cosmic backing, and December will feel <em>much </em>more like the fresh chapter you’ve been waiting for. Let it begin. </p>

<p><strong><em>Spoilers ahead. </em></strong>There’s been a lot of talk about <a href=""https://variety.com/2025/film/awards/jon-m-chu-wicked-for-good-spoilers-ending-explained-1236587506/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">the door</a>.

During “<a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/5shGj5OOnpmg4tQlFjyzZY"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">For Good</a>,” the movie’s title track, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/11/11816225/cynthia-erivo-wicked-review-elphaba-black"">Cynthia Erivo’s Elphaba</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GGs4fFd-kd0"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ariana Grande’s Glinda</a> dramatically say their goodbyes to each other through a dilapidated barrier, and through tears, of course. At the end of this scene, <a href=""https://www.eonline.com/ca/news/1425367/cynthia-erivo-reveals-wicked-for-good-unscripted-moment"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glinda and Elphaba</a> exchange three words that — until now — <a href=""https://variety.com/2025/film/awards/jon-m-chu-wicked-for-good-spoilers-ending-explained-1236587506/"">were forbidden</a> in the world composer Stephen Schwartz created: “I love you.” </p>



<p>The moment, like most things in director<a href=""https://www.goldderby.com/film/2025/wicked-for-good-director-jon-m-chu-interview/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> Jon M. Chu’s </a><em><a href=""https://www.goldderby.com/film/2025/wicked-for-good-director-jon-m-chu-interview/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wicked</a></em> universe, is devastatingly emotional, maximized to elicit big feelings from the audience, and anchored by two performances that, no matter how saccharine the material, pull the film back down to the ground. If “<a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7569880837202758943"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Defying Gravity</a>” was a confrontation between a budding radical and a well-meaning white moderate about how power corrupts and divides, “For Good” can be read as the reconciliation between two people with different approaches to the same problem: fighting facism. But also, it’s simply about the power of friendship. It’s about how friendship molds you, how it can be the thing that heals and bonds, and the relationship that reorganizes the molecules in your brain, shifting everything you thought you knew about yourself and the world around you. Friendship is what makes us whole. It’s what makes us human. And, most importantly, <em><a href=""https://variety.com/2025/film/news/box-office-wicked-for-good-opening-day-1236588784/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wicked: For Good</a> </em>is about how Elphaba and Glinda are the great loves of each other’s lives. </p>



<p>If you didn’t get all that from two witches singing harmonies only celestial beings could hit, maybe <em>Wicked</em> isn’t for you. And that’s OK. Some of my fellow critics have had harsh reactions to <em>Wicked: For Good. </em><a href=""https://www.npr.org/2025/11/20/nx-s1-5612585/wicked-for-good-review-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo"">NPR’s<em> </em>headline reads</a>, “This could have all been one movie” and <a href=""https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/movies/articles/wicked-good-review-finale-needlessly-170000405.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEOlEe0qKSwP09FIjZ8fkIvB65y1-yLw9Gwhlx9U5mBVejoizfBpQBPL9x8XJ6Xo0ddICnDXrBraIYpAn0iMZhqVawawoz_F5MjPKzI41Lr0TwMFvIg59D9-xSRYaX7_f1OewVAhCiaZham6CFIMDay2QscPapnsx2nkpDzEIZom"">IndieWire writes</a>, “Finale of a Needlessly Two-Part Movie Musical  Adaptation Doesn’t Go Out on a High Note.” <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/wicked-for-good-movie-review-23fe7244c429facf27442cbff470f67f"">AP News</a> went with a nod to <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>: “sorry, my pretty, ‘For Good’ doesn’t delight.” <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/11/wicked-for-good-movie-review/685003/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Atlantic:</a> “Wicked: For Good Bursts Its Own Bubble.” <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-current-cinema/wicked-for-good-is-very-very-bad"">The New Yorker’s review by Justin Chang</a> is the most ruthless, calling the movie “very, very bad” while chiding its “dreadful filmmaking.” Every one of these reviews make some fair points about the clunky inclusion of Dorothy, her cohort, and the effectiveness of <em>Wicked</em> as a prequel to <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2020/01/9321775/judy-garland-actress-true-story-life-death"">The Wizard of Oz</a></em>, but most of these critics didn’t like the first one either. And since, famously, part two of the musical has never been revered as highly as part one, those reactions were inevitable. But what so many of these detractors see as <em><a href=""https://www.slashfilm.com/2031892/wicked-for-good-first-movie-biggest-weakness-not-resolved/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wicked: For Good’s </a></em><a href=""https://www.slashfilm.com/2031892/wicked-for-good-first-movie-biggest-weakness-not-resolved/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">weaknesses</a> — its sincerity, optimistic politics, tidy resolutions, and feel-good messaging — are actually its strengths. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>What so many detractors see as <em>Wicked: For Good’s </em>weaknesses — its sincerity, optimistic politics, tidy resolutions, and feel-good messaging — are actually its strengths. </p><cite>kathleen newman-bremang</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>In a time when everyone’s a critic but no one’s an expert (an Amazon mic and a TikTok account do not a specialist make) and when standom has made it nearly impossible to share a dissenting opinion without heaps of hate, doxxing, and backlash, I’m never going to knock well-written, thoughtful criticism (even if I think some of these reviews are written by men who just don’t like musicals, or women emoting). But I can disagree. And I don’t think <em>Wicked: For Good</em> is a disappointment. It’s a pretty faithful adaptation of the second act of an ambitious musical that aims to please. The <a href=""https://people.com/wicked-for-good-movie-broadway-musical-differences-11852997"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">changes from the Broadway musical</a> to the big screen (like giving Glinda more depth and making <a href=""https://people.com/wicked-marissa-bode-teases-part-2-exclusive-8753054"">Nessarose’s arc less ableist</a>) absolutely work to make the narrative more cohesive, modern, and to deliver satisfying moments that make sure moviegoers get their money’s worth. </p>



<p>One of those moments is “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO8SiN8H6EQ"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">For Good</a>,” the musical number we’ve waited a whole year for. Erivo and Grande have gotten flack for their <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/movies/wicked-for-good-2-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">joint press interviews</a> that people perceive as codependent, cloying, and overly emotional. But once you see these two sing<em> “Who can say if I’ve been/ changed for the better/ But because I knew you/ I have been changed for good”</em> it starts to make sense. First of all, they are theater kids. Being overly emotional is their whole thing. Also, it’s refreshing to see two performers care so deeply about their work that they can’t help but cry about it. I’d take this energy over indifference any day. To hear <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HRhj5zRKN4"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Grande and Erivo tell it</a>, the parallels <a href=""https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a69474524/ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-friendship-timeline/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">between their friendship</a> and the one we see on screen are vast, and since they’ve been sitting with this material for years, they’ve developed a bond that formed long before they locked fingers in a junket while <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2024/11/26/wicked-ariana-grande-and-cynthia-erivos-holding-space-meme-explained/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">holding space for the lyrics of “Defying Gravity.</a>” And once you are sitting in the theater locked in on the culmination of Elphaba and Glinda’s saga, you’ll forget about the off-camera speculation and public perceptions and drift away to Oz to be serenaded by the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda The Good who have, against all odds, found their way back to each other. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11944468.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>L to R: Cynthia Erivo is Elphaba and Jonathan Bailey is Fiyero in WICKED FOR GOOD, directed by Jon M. Chu.</figcaption></figure>



<p>By the time we get to “For Good” in the film, Elphaba has been living in hiding attempting to expose the Wizard’s lies. She’s on a quest to free Oz’s animals who have been stripped of their voices and their rights. Her image (caricature posters depicting her with exaggerated features are so comically evil, they are reminiscent of <a href=""https://jimcrowmuseum.ferris.edu/coon/homepage.htm"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jim Crow-era, anti-Black imagery</a>) is projected all over Oz as a symbol of hate and villainy. Conversely, Glinda has everything she’s ever wanted — she’s risen to fame as a beloved symbol of Goodness — but still doesn’t have any magic of her own. With the help of Madame Morrible (a consistently uneven <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7436842946059570478"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Michelle Yeoh</a>), she’s keeping up illusions to maintain the Wizard’s tyrannical rule. Glinda is literally living in a bubble to upkeep the lies. She’s everything Elphaba warned her of becoming in “Defying Gravity.” Glinda is about to marry Fiyero (played perfectly by <a href=""https://people.com/jonathan-bailey-is-sexiest-man-alive-2025-11842000"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sexiest Man Alive, Jonathan Bailey</a>), now the captain of the Wizard’s guard, who hasn’t stopped his search for his real love, Elphaba. </p>



<p>It would be easy to read the dynamic between Elphaba, Fiyero and Glinda as just another literary love triangle, with two girls torn between a dashing prince, but as charming and <em>hot </em>as Fiyero is (I broke into a sweat during the chaste yet horny “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OdTKfYqBXY"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">As Long As You’re Mine</a>”), he’s really not that important. While it’s beautiful to see Elphaba find the romantic love she deserves, and the origin story of the Scaregrow is the strongest part of the <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2014/08/73723/wizard-of-oz-75-anniversary-pictures"">Wizard of Oz</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2014/08/73723/wizard-of-oz-75-anniversary-pictures""> </a>tie-in, Fiyero mainly exists as a test of Glinda and Elphaba’s friendship. On her wedding day, Glinda has to process the fact that her ex-best friend and her fiancé are about to run away together. The tables have turned and now, <em>she</em> is Not That Girl. Glinda has lived a privileged life as the popular girl, always chosen, always winning, and always sheltered from having to make any hard choices. She’s the girl who gets to walk down the aisle while Elphaba marches into the Wizard’s dungeon to free wrongfully imprisoned animals. (The gutting juxtaposition of these scenes, and how beautifully the sequence can be interpreted to show the paradox of white frivolity versus the responsibilities unfairly placed on marginalized people is why they can never make me hate Jon M. Chu.) Now, Glinda has not only lost her groom, but the bubble she so carefully constructed is also about to burst. Later, when Fiyero risks his life to save Elphaba by pointing a gun at Glinda’s face, you see her accept his love for Elphaba and her own. She calls his bluff, and resigns herself to the fact that they both love Elphaba. Of course they do. Grandé is heartbreakingly magnificent in this moment, playing Glinda’s conflict with painful awareness. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Ultimately, <em>Wicked</em> is about Elphaba and Glinda, two girls who grew together while figuring themselves out. It’s about the complexity, softness, and intensity  of platonic affection. </p><cite>kathleen newman-bremang</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>It’s clear that <em>Wicked: For Good</em>  is invested in Glinda’s redemption. She goes from self-serving mean girl to the arbiter of all things good. It’s fun to watch this transformation unfold, thanks in large part to Grande’s performance, but it’s also a fairytale without a happily ever after (I like her but I still think Glinda is a spineless, complicit, mediocre fraud who ain’t shit). We know in real life that opportunists rarely change their tune, that white women who turn their backs on their Black (ahem, green) counterparts for their own self interests do so callously and with gleeful disregard for their humanity. But in a world of talking Tin Men and cowardly lions, why can’t the fantasy include the moral salvation of the girl who “groveled in submission/ to feed [her] own ambition”? It’s a nice story, even though it comes at the expense of Elphaba’s freedom.</p>



<p>If I have one major critique of <em>Wicked: For Good, </em>it’s that I wanted more for my girl Elphaba. It’s hard to watch her fall on her sword as Glinda gets the glory. Dorothy is now in Oz, after allegedly murdering Nessarose by way of a falling house (we later learn it was Madame Morrible who did the deed, inspired by a Glinda suggestion). Elphaba decides that Oz needs a villain, a foe to Glinda’s hero, and offers herself up as the symbol they need to shun. She’s made this decision out of hurt and frustration — Fiyero is arrested and would have been beaten to death if Elphaba didn’t cast a spell turning his bones into straw — and is done doing good deeds with zero reward. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11944475.png?width=1024&amp;height=675&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A675"" /></figure>



<p>Many headlines about <em>Wicked: For Good</em> have <a href=""https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/wicked-for-good-review-give-ariana-grande-the-oscar-now/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">focused on Grande</a>, and while it’s true she is great in this sequel and that it’s more Glinda’s movie than Elphaba’s, Erivo is still firing on all cylinders, delivering a timeless performance that is also worthy of unadulterated praise. Throughout <em>Wicked: For Good, </em>Elphaba<em> </em>goes from fugitive freedom fighter, to heartbroken friend and exasperated sister, to frustrated revolutionary, to lover in mourning, to resigned martyr. It’s a depressing arc that sees the optimism of progressivism dashed with a big dose of witch-melting water. The simplicity of the message — that doing good comes at a cost, that no matter your intentions, things don’t always work in your favor, and that facism may take on a new face but it’s an ever-present threat — is the point. No one is fully good nor evil. In systems set up to oppress, the binary of good vs. evil is just another tool of the oppressor. While I don’t love the optics of a Black woman (we’ve established that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/11/11816225/cynthia-erivo-wicked-review-elphaba-black"">Elphaba is Black</a>) giving up her freedom and her reputation to save a white woman who betrayed her once and a population who vilified her, the lesson is about who you are when the choice is to do good without any benefit to yourself at all. How much goodness can you muster when it would be easier to be seduced by evil? Who are you in your darkest moments? What are your values, <em>really</em>?</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> Let’s take the <em>Wicked</em> movies for what they are instead of what you hoped the stage musical would be. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In Chang’s New Yorker review, he references <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2025/11/21/wicked-for-good-book-series-gregory-maguire/87378037007/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Gregory Maguire’s novel</a> the Broadway musical is loosely based on, which was an adaptation of Frank L. Baum’s children’s book, <em>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</em>: “Maguire’s novel was itself written in the spirit of a corrective; it aimed to bring a morally ambiguous modernism and a grownup, forthright sexuality to bear on Baum’s squeaky-clean demarcations of good and evil.” It’s true that <em>Wicked: For Good’s</em> political commentary may be clumsy at times and very much watered down from its source material (the characters are less overtly queer and some are literally whitewashed), but the musical still aims to take a stand against totalitarianism and teach audiences that a lying dictatorship uninterested in the truth and wielding power without checks and balances is bad, actually. And right now, I think that’s good, actually. </p>



<p>I understand the critiques, but let’s take the <em>Wicked</em> movies for what they are instead of what you hoped the stage musical would be. The movies were never going to be a radical reimagining of Maguire’s novel because that’s not what the musical is. It’s a big-hearted, campy, bold, funny, entertaining ride with a strong message. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11944477.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=429&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A429"" /><figcaption>L to R: Cynthia Erivo is Elphaba and Ariana Grande is Glinda in WICKED FOR GOOD, directed by Jon M. Chu.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Again, ultimately, <em>Wicked</em> is about Elphaba and Glinda, two girls who grew together while figuring themselves out. It’s about the complexity, softness, and intensity of platonic affection. It’s about how all-consuming female friendship can be in your youth. And it’s about the door (the <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/movies/cynthia-erivo-for-good-ad-lib-scene-wicked-rcna244955"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">“I love yous” were improvised, Erivo says</a>). There’s always been a chasm between the two witches — one is unusually and exceedingly peculiar and altogether quite impossible to describe, the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAvOfEweyJo"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">other is blonde</a> — and as they finally reach their farewell, the realization that they are better off because of their relationship hits, and it all coalesces in a gut wrenching declaration of mutual adoration, respect, and forgiveness. The fact that there is still a door between them in this moment, a physical divide between them as they grow into their most actualized selves, is exactly the ending these two characters should have, no matter how bittersweet. </p>



<p>It’s up for debate if Glinda and Elphaba ever see each other again, or if Glinda even knows her best friend is alive and wandering beyond the walls of Oz journeying to a new life with Fiyero (I think the answer is yes). In the <em>Wicked</em> cinematic universe, it’s also left unclear as to what kind of leader Glinda The Good becomes. In the absence of her evil overlords, does Glinda live up to the task Elphaba entrusts her with? Does she stay true to the final speech she gives to her fellow Ozians? Does she become who her best friend believed she could be? There’s hope in each of these questions. And when you look at it all through Elphaba’s eyes — the ones that saw the Good in Glinda before she did — it’s enough to move even the most cynical viewer. Even if you aren’t sobbing in the theater like I was, I promise if you open your heart, let go and embrace its earnestness, <em>Wicked: For Good </em>will change something in you for the better. </p>

<p>When it comes to beauty, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/is-korean-skincare-better-expert-advice"">Korea is in a league</a> of its own. Glass skin wasn’t created by accident; it’s all about careful, consistent care. But this meticulous approach isn’t limited to skincare — Korea is now bringing the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/kundal-korean-shampoo-hair-treatment-review"">same precision to haircare</a>. Forget miracle shampoos and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/rosemary-oil-hair-growth-benefits"">hair growth serums</a> for a second. This time, it’s treatments. Enter: hairline microblading.</p>



<p>Even if hairline microblading is completely new to you, I’m willing to bet you’ve at least heard of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/microblading-pigment-removal-trend""><em>brow</em> microblading</a>. You probably know someone who swears by it. The semi-permanent makeup treatment is famous worldwide for using tiny needles and natural-tone pigments to mimic fine brow hairs, essentially filling in sparse patches. Some microblading technicians can even create an entire brow from scratch. </p>

<p>Considering its ability to transform a face, it was only a matter of time before microblading made its way to the scalp. If Korea’s hair experts are anything to go by, it’s an excellent way to boost a thinning hairline quickly and effectively, outperforming tedious (and often questionable) hair growth serums.</p>



<p>Here’s everything you need to know about hairline microblading — and how to make it work for you.</p>



<h2>First of all, what causes a thinning hairline?</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.ukhairconsultants.com/eva-proudmans-clinics/"">Eva Proudman</a> FIT IAT, a leading consultant trichologist, says the hairline is the only place on our bodies that retains ‘baby’ or vellus hairs — essentially finer, wispier strands — so shedding there can appear more noticeable. A handful of factors can trigger hair shedding, also known as telogen effluvium. Think: hormonal shifts, stress, illness, weight loss, certain medications, and even high-tension hairstyles, like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/09/11521323/sofia-richie-sleek-bun-hair-style"">slicked-back buns or tight ponytails</a>. </p>



<h2>What is hairline microblading, and what are the benefits?</h2>



<p>Among professionals, hairline microblading is commonly referred to as scalp micropigmentation (SMP), says Proudman, who recommends it in the right circumstances. “It involves medical tattoos being applied to the scalp as small dots to give the illusion of follicles and hair.” Hairline microblading can be effective for certain types of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/drinking-matcha-hair-loss-thinning"">thinning and hair loss</a>, adds Proudman, and it’s often used to disguise small areas rather than provide full coverage — but not everyone is qualified to perform it.</p>



<p><a href=""https://karenbetts.com/"">Karen Betts</a>, an authority in permanent makeup treatments and founder of Karen Betts Clinics, says hairline microblading requires a highly experienced hand. “Brow hairs are shorter, coarser, and more structured, but hairline hairs around the temples grow more sparsely and lie flatter,” she explains. As such, hairline strokes need to be softer, more diffused, and carefully placed to blend seamlessly with existing hair, adds Betts. Thanks to ultra-fine needles, it’s now easier to replicate fine hairs with ink, but it’s still essential to choose a practitioner who’s properly qualified in scalp microblading. </p>

<h2>What are the risks or challenges associated with hairline microblading?</h2>



<p>If TikTok is anything to go by, hairline microblading might seem like a miracle solution for those experiencing thinning, but it’s not without its downsides. Firstly, your skin type matters. Betts explains that some people have thinner scalp skin than others, which requires a much lighter touch to avoid irritation or tattooing too deeply — again, why it’s important to go to someone qualified to work on the scalp and who knows their stuff. </p>



<p>If your scalp tends to be oilier, this can blur the pigment, adds Betts, making hair strokes appear unnatural and affecting how long they last. Then there’s the color choice and stroke direction, all of which matter for seamless, natural results. Betts adds that for clients with darker skin tones, there may not be enough contrast between the pigment and the skin to show fine detail. “In these cases, the effect will look more like shading rather than distinct hair strokes,” she says. </p>



<p>Proudman warns that, like brows, the hairline is very visible. “Getting something that is too heavy or obvious, or sits below the natural hairline, is simply not a good idea, and you may come to regret it,” she says. Ultimately, hairline microblading should be a collaborative process with your chosen artist. “If there’s any uncertainty about how the skin will take the pigment, it’s wise to do a test area first to see how the color holds,” says Betts. “Pigment may also fade unevenly if the strokes aren’t applied carefully,” she adds. Betts emphasizes the importance of choosing a qualified professional and says it’s all about patience and restraint, enhancing the hairline in a subtle way, rather than trying to completely transform it.</p>

<h2>How does hairline microblading compare to hair growth treatments like minoxidil?</h2>



<p>While hairline microblading is popping off on TikTok, Betts isn’t entirely sure the trend will stick around. But given its growing number of fans, she suspects it’ll fare better than some other semi-permanent tattoo trends: “Think blush, freckles, or lining eyeliner and lips with white shades,” she says. “I’ve tried all of those and they don’t age well.”</p>



<p>If microblading doesn’t sound like one for you, Proudman says there are a number of treatments for the hairline. First up: Minoxidil, also known as Rogaine, which is clinically proven to stimulate hair growth and slow hair loss. “Diet also matters,” adds Proudman. “Make sure yours is packed full of protein.” You might also want to consider supplements to correct nutrient deficiencies, says Proudman. Ask your doctor for bloodwork to see if you’re deficient.</p>



<h2>How long does hairline microblading last, and how much is it?</h2>



<p>Hairline microblading isn’t a one-and-done treatment; you might require a few sessions. While the results typically last anywhere between 12 to 18 months, Proudman suggests being prepared for maintenance: “This procedure isn’t permanent and will need care and attention,” says Proudman, including aftercare like keeping the scalp clean and moisturized, avoiding direct sun, and scheduling touch-ups throughout the years as the pigment fades. </p>



<p>Hairline microblading isn’t cheap. While the cost largely depends on the size of the area you want to treat, it can vary from clinic to clinic and, at the very least, is likely to start around $1,500. Top-ups will be cheaper.</p>

<h2>How else can you get your hairline back?</h2>



<p>Regardless of the treatment you choose, if your hairline is thinning, Proudman suggests getting a full, professional diagnosis from a trichologist or doctor first. “This will answer what condition you have. Is it stable or progressive? Can it be recovered? If so, to what extent?” asks Proudman. If the hairline isn’t stable or can be improved with treatments, she recommends waiting to see how things settle before opting for microblading. “In the end, this might not be necessary,” says Proudman, or worse, “it may become obvious once the hair grows in.” </p>



<p>At the end of the day, do your research thoroughly before opting for trending treatments like these — they may fade eventually, but you’ll be living with the results for a long while.</p>
