From Japanese haikus to the refined sculptures of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantin_Br%C3%A2ncu%C8%99i?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Constantin Brâncuși</a>, many artistic expressions have sought to condense the maximum meaning with the minimum of elements. This economy of form is not a sign of scarcity, but of intensity: every stroke, every word, every silence gains weight. There is something intrinsically appealing in what presents itself as simple and well-resolved, whether it is a text that wastes no words, a tennis player who moves with purposeful gestures, or a melody that is both direct yet unexpectedly profound.</p>",

<p><em>Located in Nature –</em><strong> </strong>The site is located in a small residential district developed in the early 2000s to collectively relocate residents who had been scattered in the Jeungsimsa Temple district of Mudeungsan Mountain, outside the park areas. The refreshing sound of rushing water in the valley and its proximity to the summit of Mudeungsan Mountain create a beautiful and serene village atmosphere. Visitors who travel from afar for meals or tea, hikers, and local residents strolling through the village add a subtle liveliness to the community.   </p>",

<p><em>From the Place</em> – Chacol Haus (charcoal) is located midway up an unremarkable Korean hillside, densely covered with pine trees. Below the site, an industrial complex is planned. This creates an unexpectedly open view. Because the land is within a greenbelt zone, there are few buildings nearby. What makes the site unusual is the presence of a half-finished garden and fish pond. These remnants of a former business give the place an awkward atmosphere, rather than a natural one.</p>",

<p>Kirkkonummi is a municipality of 40,000 inhabitants near Helsinki built around its Medieval stone church. Facing the church, JKMM has transformed the old city library. Together with the nearby open market, the church and library create the civic centre of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/kirkkonummi"">Kirkkonummi</a>. JKMM have therefore emphasised the relationship of the library with the neighbouring church by designing a 50-metre long sheltered terrace overlooking the church yard. The copper shingle cladding of the new library, called Fyyri, also relates back to its maritime heritage setting.</p>",

<h3>A UX carol</h3><h4>It was Christmas Eve, 2025, and like any other day, Ulysses Xavier was doom-scrolling LinkedIn.</h4><figure><img alt=""Stylized illustration titled “The Ghost of UX Past”: a nostalgic attic scene where a modern young man with a smartphone stands beside a seated person using an old desktop computer. A ghostly figure holding a book labeled “HTML” points at the retro screen displaying a hit counter for a website."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*nrlgpOj8kMplYupM.png"" /></figure><p>It was Christmas Eve, 2025, and like any other day, Ulysses Xavier was doom-scrolling LinkedIn.</p><p>Ulysses was a UX designer — or a “Product Designer,” or maybe a “Digital Experience Architect,” or a “Product Experience Manager,” depending on which day you asked him. Currently, however, he felt more like a Figma monkey. He sat in his Scandinavian designer chair, bathed in the orangey light of a dual-monitor setup (because you gotta filter out that blue light), reading yet another hot take about how AI had rendered his so-called career — which was kind of a joke, anyway — obsolete.</p><p>“Bah,” Ulysses muttered, quickly archiving yet another generic rejection email from a job application. “Humbug.”</p><p>He closed his eyes, wishing for the good old times when designers did all the user research and customer journeys by themselves. When he opened them, his MacBook and monitors were gone and his Spotify playlist “Coffee Shop Background Noises” replaced by the screeching, static-filled sound of a 28.8k modem connecting to the internet.</p><h3>The First of the Three Spirits</h3><p>Standing before him was an ethereal, slightly translucent figure dressed in flannel and holding a copy of <em>HTML for Dummies</em>.</p><p>“I am the Ghost of UX Past,” the figure said, its voice crackling like a 32-kbps RealAudio. “Come with me.”</p><p>Suddenly, Ulysses was back in 1995. He saw an attic. A solitary figure sat hunched over a CRT monitor, coding in what looked like a very old-school Apple Notes, typing on a keyboard that seemed way too clunky and loud.</p><p>“Is that ... a developer?” Ulysses asked.</p><p>“No,” the Ghost corrected. “That is Max. He’s what’s called a webmaster. In this era, there are no silos. He designs the page, writes the HTML, configures the server, and crops the JPEGs in Photoshop. He’s like a general contractor of the web.”​¹</p><p>Ulysses watched Max struggle. He was using invisible tables for layout because CSS didn’t really exist yet.² He was embedding headers as images because there were only a handful of fonts like Times New Roman and Courier available.³ It looked like a horrible mess … and painful.​</p><p>“It looks terrible,” Ulysses whispered, eyeing a blinking hit counter.</p><p>“It’s <em>foundational</em>,” the Ghost retorted. “There is nothing like ‘user experience’ yet — Don Norman has only started coining the term at Apple recently.⁴ But look at the ownership. Look at the freedom. There are no stakeholders blocking tickets. There’s just the creator and the user. It’s chaotic, yes. But it’s pure creative problem solving … well, maybe more creative than solving, to be fair.”​</p><p>“What is he using?” Ulysses asked. The ghost put a hand on his shoulder: “It’s called Notepad.”</p><p>Ulysses realized something. The constraints of the past — the technical limits, the lack of tools — forced immense creativity, even if the pages often seemed ugly. But these people weren’t just pushing (ugly) pixels; they were actually wrestling a giant squid.​</p><h3>The Second of the Three Spirits</h3><p>The scene dissolved into a sterile, open-plan office. Ulysses was sitting at a desk that looked like it rather belonged in a hospital. He noticed that on his monitor, there was a Zoom call with 45 participants.</p><p>“Am I … in a Zoom call … in an office? Why?”</p><p>“That’s the exact question I ask myself everyday … I’m the Ghost of UX Present, by the way,” sighed a weary figure who had appeared at his side, wearing a hoodie and looking noticeably burned out.</p><p>Ulysses looked around in confusion. He saw hundreds of designers churning out high-fidelity mockups in Figma, moving pixels by 4px increments. He saw their anxiety as Slack channels quickly filled with requests from stakeholders and management.</p><p>A couple of desks down, one of the designers was just laid off by his manager, “because revenue is bad and we have AI now to save costs.”</p><p>“Look at them,” the Ghost gestured. “They are terrified.”</p><p>Where the Ghost had gestured, Ulysses now saw analytics dashboards floating in the air like holographic projections. He couldn’t identify all the numbers<a href=""https://2008.maxspeicher.com/2022/09/26/steal-this-blog-post/"">,</a> because they seemed to be using Liquid Glass, but he saw the more than 250,000 tech layoffs from 2023.⁵ He saw the job market flooded with bootcamp graduates who had been promised secure and high-paying UX jobs.​⁶</p><p>“They feel like assembly line workers,” Ulysses said, recognizing the feeling. “Figma monkeys.”⁷</p><p>“Precisely,” the Ghost nodded. “They see product managers doing user research and creating wireframes. They see AI generating layouts faster than they can think. They are fighting for a seat at the table, but once they get there, they just take orders.”​⁸</p><p>The Ghost showed him a designer arguing with a stakeholder. The designer wanted to do discovery research; the stakeholder just wanted the screens done by Friday.</p><p>“We have become obsessed with the <em>artifacts</em> of design,” the Ghost said sadly. “Screens. Flows. Wireframes. We forgot that our job isn’t to make files. It’s to ensure the product works for the user. And because we act like factory workers, we are surprised when business treats us like a cost center to be optimized.”​</p><p>Ulysses felt a pit in his stomach. “Is this it? Is this how it ends? Replaced by AI, apathy, and alienation?”</p><h3>The Last of the Spirits</h3><p>The Zoom call and the office around it faded. Ulysses found himself in a quiet, sunlit room. There were no screens. No keyboards. Just people talking, gesturing, and collaborating. All of them were wearing tags: Human-Centered Product Manager, Interaction Systems Architect, Behavioral Product Strategist, Experience Integration Lead, and Cognitive Systems Engineer.</p><p>A tall, calm figure stood there. This Ghost didn’t look scary. It looked … Ulysses didn’t know how exactly, but maybe something like empowered?!</p><p>“I know what you think. You’ve looked at the job titles and now you think UX is dead,” the Ghost said. “But you are confusing the <em>title</em> with the <em>discipline</em>. We are all designers in one way or the other. I used to be called a ‘UX designer,’ but that was a long time ago.”</p><p>“Where are the screens?” Ulysses asked, looking for a laptop.</p><p>“Gone,” the Ghost smiled. “Or rather, the ideas of ‘screens’ and ‘average users’ are gone. Why would we design one interface on just 5 different screens, but for millions of users? The ‘average’ user never existed anyway.”</p><p>The Ghost waved a hand, and Ulysses saw a vision of the future:</p><h4>1. The End of the Screen (as we know it)</h4><p>“People here don’t draw pages,” the Ghost explained. “They define systems and constraints. They design components and the rules that govern them — ‘The header is always top,’ ‘Component A prioritizes over Component B,’ and so on. An AI takes those components and rules and generates hyper-personalized interfaces for every single user, adapted to their specific device and context.”</p><h4>2. The Designer as Educator</h4><p>Ulysses saw a Human-Centered Product Manager sitting with a Behavioral Product Strategist and a Cognitive Systems Engineer in what seemed to be a very intensive coaching session. “We stopped fighting the inevitable,” the Ghost said. “We embraced the fact that stakeholders, engineers, and product managers want — and need — to be involved in design. So we became force multipliers. We realized that — just like with research—you can’t prevent ‘non-designers’ from designing. But they need support and guidance to ensure the best outcome for the user. Now, our job is to empower <em>everyone</em> to solve their problems with the right design methods, so we can focus on the really wicked stuff and strategy. Oh, and you of course noticed already, but we all got new titles and merged with other disciplines, because in the end, <em>everything</em> is design and nobody understood UX correctly, anyway.”​</p><h4>3. The Death of the “Monkey Worker”</h4><p>“But what about AI?” Ulysses asked. “Did it replace us?”<br />“Obviously not. It replaced the monkey workers,” the Ghost answered firmly. “It replaced the rote production of UI assets. But it couldn’t replace the creative problem solving. Real designers aren’t monkey workers. They are strategic partners. The term ‘UX Designer’ might have vanished from job descriptions, merged into Product or Engineering, but the <em>practice</em> of UX is more vital than ever. Because one thing is for sure: there’ll always be users, and there’ll always be experiences.”</p><h3>The End of It</h3><p>Ulysses Xavier woke up with a start. The orangey light of his monitors seemed to hum softly.</p><p>He looked at his LinkedIn feed again. The doom-mongering articles were still there. The job market was still tough. But for the first time in months — maybe years — he didn’t feel cynical.</p><p>He realized that if he kept clinging to some kind of nostalgic understanding of UX from 1995, 2005, or 2015, he would indeed become a fossil. But if he embraced the shift? If he stopped designing screens for made-up personas that didn’t exist and started designing systems and strategy for an AI to build upon?</p><p>“UX isn’t dying,” Ulysses whispered to his empty room. “It’s merely growing up and finding a new identity.”</p><p>He sat up, opened LinkedIn Learning and typed: “How to build AI systems.” Then, he created a new document and began to jot down the concept for a proper design system for his websites.</p><p><em>Hi! 👋🏻 I’m </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximilianspeicher/""><em>Max</em></a><em>, a Product Design Director and Freelance Product Consultant with a Ph.D. in computer science.

<h4>AI didn’t create the craft crisis in design — it exposed the technical literacy gap that’s been eroding strategic influence for over a decade.</h4><figure><img alt=""Dylan Field at Figma 2024 Config"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RUyj6Nw2PozgI2F1o8ToIA.avif"" /><figcaption>Dylan Field at Figma 2024 Config (Source: <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/whats-happening-at-config-2024/"">Figma blog</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>At <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/whats-happening-at-config-2024/"">Figma’s Config 2024</a>, CEO Dylan Field stood before 10,000 designers and typed a simple prompt: <em>“A personal portfolio website for a sustainable Middle Earth architect.”</em> Seconds later, a complete UI layout materialized on screen. The crowd watched as Figma’s AI generated wireframes, layouts, and design systems from text prompts.</p><p>Field’s pitch was seductive: “In a world where more software is being created and reimagined because of AI, designing and building products is everyone’s business.”</p><p>Everyone’s business. The democratization promise we’ve heard before — this time powered by GPT-4o and Amazon’s image generators. Some features got huge reactions. The Rename Layers tool earned cheers. But on social media after the event, a different story emerged.</p><p>Designer <a href=""https://sdw.space/figma-ai-and-lost-jobs/"">Sebastiaan de With wrote</a> what many were thinking: “Figma AI will kill most — if not all — of these entry-level design jobs… if someone can simply get that poster (and 10 more like it) generated in a click, people will opt for that most of the time.” The anxiety wasn’t about the technology. It was about what the technology revealed: if AI can do your job with a text prompt, what exactly is your job?</p><p>Then came <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/02/figma-disables-its-ai-design-feature-that-appeared-to-be-ripping-off-apples-weather-app/"">the Apple Weather app incident</a>. Within days of launch, someone noticed Figma’s AI was generating designs that looked suspiciously like Apple’s Weather app. Not inspired by. Actually resembling. Field disabled the feature and admitted the company had rushed to hit a Config deadline. The feature relaunched months later as “First Draft,” with better guardrails.</p><p>But the damage was philosophical, not just technical. The promise of AI democratizing design ran headlong into a paradox nobody wanted to say out loud: these tools don’t make design accessible to everyone. They make design accessible to people who already understand what they’re looking at.</p><h3>The Paradox Nobody Mentions</h3><p>Here’s what actually happened when non-technical users got their hands on AI design tools.</p><p>In May 2025, accessibility expert <a href=""https://adrianroselli.com/2025/05/do-not-publish-your-designs-on-the-web-with-figma-sites.html"">Adrian Roselli tested Figma Sites</a> — the company’s new publish-to-web feature that promised to turn Figma designs into live websites. He ran automated tests on Figma’s own flagship demo sites. The results were brutal: <strong>210 WCAG violations</strong> on one demo site. Another had 107 violations. Images with no alt text. Contrast ratios failing basic accessibility standards. The HTML output was what Roselli called “div soup” — everything rendered as generic container elements, even headings and navigation.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot showing 210 WCAG accessibility violations detected in Figma Sites demo, with critical errors highlighted in red including missing alt text and contrast issues"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*u1udQD4giE_5_j7PMPHSBw.png"" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=""https://adrianroselli.com/2025/05/do-not-publish-your-designs-on-the-web-with-figma-sites.html"">Adrian Roselli</a>’s blogpost on Do Not Publish Your Designs on the Web with Figma Sites…</figcaption></figure><p>The technical implementation was worse. Drop caps were created using background-colored underscores, a technique that belonged in 1974 typewriter manuals, not modern web development. One commenter created a satirical video called “Introducing: Webbed Sites.” Another posted a reaction titled “Figma’s New Horrific DIV Generator.”</p><p>This wasn’t an AI training problem. This was an expertise problem masquerading as a democratization tool. Figma Sites generated technically valid HTML that was utterly inappropriate for actual use. If you don’t know why that’s a problem, the tool won’t help you. If you do know why it’s a problem, you probably wouldn’t use the tool.</p><p>The pattern repeated across every AI design tool that launched in 2024–2025. V0 by Vercel produced code that stopped mid-generation. Users reported the AI losing context and forgetting previous work. Bolt.new earned a 1.5-star rating on Trustpilot, with users reporting they spent over a thousand dollars in tokens just trying to fix code problems. One developer burned through 20 million tokens on a single authentication issue. Critical files went missing. Projects deployed with blank screens.</p><p>Claude Code, despite being one of the more capable AI coding tools, experienced performance degradation so severe that GitHub users reported 30–40% drops in development speed. Tasks that previously took one day required two or three. The most telling detail: Anthropic had to publish an official postmortem admitting infrastructure bugs caused the AI to produce broken code with odd characters.</p><p>And then there was <a href=""https://techstartups.com/2025/05/24/builder-ai-a-microsoft-backed-ai-startup-once-valued-at-1-2-billion-files-for-bankruptcy-is-ai-becoming-another-com-bubble/"">Builder.ai</a> — the cautionary tale everyone should study. Valued at $1.5 billion with backing from Microsoft and Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, Builder.ai promised AI-powered app development. The company employed over 1,500 people and raised $445 million. In May 2025, it filed for bankruptcy. The reason? The “AI” was actually 700 Indian engineers manually coding everything. The Wall Street Journal had exposed this back in 2019, but the company limped along for six more years. Enterprise clients experienced apps crashing under basic user loads. A former employee later joked that the “AI” stood for “Another Indian.”</p><p>The paradox crystalizes: tools marketed as democratization require <em>more</em> technical knowledge than traditional workflows, not less. You need to understand prompt engineering, debug AI-generated output, recognize when the AI is hallucinating, and know enough about technical constraints to evaluate whether what the AI produces is actually feasible.</p><p>We told ourselves AI would level the playing field. Instead, it raised the floor. If you can’t tell the difference between functional code and broken code, between accessible design and inaccessible design, between scalable architecture and technical debt, these tools just let you fail faster.</p><h3>How We Got Here</h3><p>The craft crisis didn’t start with AI. AI just made it impossible to ignore.</p><p>Somewhere in the early 2010s, the design industry made a collective decision: designers don’t need to code. <a href=""https://mralancooper.medium.com/should-designers-code-cde3ef9d6621"">Alan Cooper</a>, the father of Visual Basic and interaction design pioneer, wrote definitively that coding wasn’t necessary for top-notch designers. Design Thinking became the dominant framework, emphasizing empathy and process over technical craft. Design bootcamps proliferated with promises of career changes in six months, explicitly advertising that no coding knowledge was required.</p><p><a href=""https://designlab.com/blog/google-ux-design-certificate-on-coursera-is-it-worth-it"">Google’s UX Certificate</a> on Coursera states clearly: “UX design requires no knowledge of coding.” For $300 and six months at 10 hours per week, you could become a UX designer. Bootcamps charged $10,000 for 12-week programs focused on wireframing, prototyping, and user research — not technical implementation.</p><p>This wasn’t gatekeeping by engineers. This was the design industry telling itself a story about what designers needed to know. The story went like this: designers focus on users, empathy, and problem-solving. Engineers focus on implementation, code, and technical constraints. Clean separation of concerns. Everyone stays in their lane.</p><h3>What we lost wasn’t the ability to code. What we lost was the ability to participate in technical conversations.</h3><p>Understanding why an API limitation makes a feature infeasible. Recognizing when performance constraints should influence design decisions. Knowing enough about technical debt to engage in build-versus-buy discussions. Being able to evaluate whether AI-generated code actually works or just looks like it works.</p><p><a href=""https://rogerwong.me/2025/07/design-talent-crisis"">Roger Wong</a>, analyzing the design talent crisis in 2025, put it bluntly: entry-level designers at Big Tech now represent just 7% of all hires — a 50% drop from 2019. How do designers develop taste, craft, and strategic thinking without doing the foundational work? The industry created a pipeline that produces designers who can talk about empathy but can’t evaluate technical trade-offs.</p><figure><img alt=""Bar chart showing tech industry layoffs from 2020–2024, with peak layoffs of 167,000 in Q1 2023 and 150,000+ layoffs continuing through 2024"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dkXedIBWDnc8-94nlUD-Kw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=""https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-the-major-tech-layoffs-in-2024-so-far/"">https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-the-major-tech-layoffs-in-2024-so-far/</a></figcaption></figure><p>The consequences show up everywhere. <a href=""https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/10-ways-to-improve-design-to-development-handoff/"">UXPin research</a> found that 62% of developers spend significant time redoing designs due to communication breakdowns. Not because designers made bad aesthetic choices. Because designers proposed things that were technically nonsensical, or missed constraints that would have changed the entire approach.</p><p>A designer proposes a feature without understanding that it requires a new API endpoint, which requires backend changes, which requires database migrations, which means a three-month timeline instead of a three-week timeline. The feature gets de-scoped or killed. The designer learns their proposals aren’t strategic input — they’re suggestions engineers will simplify into whatever is actually buildable.</p><p>This happened so many times, in so many companies, that it became the pattern. Designers create mockups. Engineers override them based on technical constraints the designer didn’t know existed. The designer spends days in “alignment meetings” trying to advocate for the user, but can’t speak the technical language needed to actually influence the decision. Business stakeholders step in to make product calls because they can at least understand the technical constraints, even if they don’t understand users.</p><p><a href=""https://designsystems.international/ideas/product-design-is-lost/"">Rune Madsen</a>, in his essay “Product Design Is Lost,” captured this perfectly: designers found themselves “in a place between strategy and implementation, yet they are not fully empowered to influence either.” We’re filling our time with checklists instead of focusing on the very thing that makes designers relevant. We’ve been painted into a corner.</p><p>The industry did this to itself. And we called it progress.</p><h3>Why This Matters Now</h3><p>Here’s the part that makes designers defensive: we lost influence long before AI showed up. AI just exposed the gap.</p><p>The “Great Design Handoff” wasn’t a single event — it was a slow erosion of strategic control. Growth teams took over conversion optimization. Algorithms dictated layout and personalization. Business stakeholders made product decisions. Design leaders found themselves defending the existence of their teams rather than shaping product strategy.</p><p>The evidence is everywhere. <a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/90976682/design-giant-ideo-cuts-a-third-of-staff-and-closes-offices-as-the-era-of-design-thinking-ends"">IDEO</a> — the company that popularized Design Thinking — lost half its headcount between 2020 and 2025. Revenue dropped from $300 million to $100 million. Google laid off over 100 designers in November 2024, cutting some cloud design teams in half. IBM eliminated its chief design officer position entirely. Autodesk cut 1,350 employees in December 2024. Across tech, <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3816662/tech-layoffs-in-2024-a-timeline.html"">150,000+ jobs disappeared in 2024</a> alone.</p><p>But here’s the telling detail: only one major company hired a chief design officer in the second half of 2023. PayPal. That’s it. Executive-level design roles are disappearing across corporate America, and it’s not because AI replaced them. It’s because the roles stopped delivering strategic value.</p><p><a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/91027996/the-big-design-freak-out-a-generation-of-design-leaders-grapple-with-their-future"">Fast Company reported</a> on a March 2024 conference where design leaders from P&amp;G, Ford, Verizon, GE Healthcare, and other Fortune 500 companies confronted the question directly: “Is Design Dead?” The consensus wasn’t about AI. It was about business priorities. Design has been deprioritized during a business cycle championing technology and marketing.</p><p>Netflix provides the clearest case study. Eighty percent of all viewing hours come from algorithmic recommendations. The homepage layout, row ordering, and even the thumbnails users see are determined by algorithms, not designers. Netflix’s personalization saves over a billion dollars per year in subscriber retention. When the business case is that strong, design becomes an execution function serving algorithmic strategy.</p><p>Growth teams present a similar challenge. <a href=""https://andrewchen.com/how-to-build-a-growth-team/"">Andrew Chen</a>, a prominent growth expert, notes that growth teams work best when they can run lightweight experiments quickly. Design-conscious companies resist this because their incentives reward large, complex projects rather than many small changes. So growth teams route around design, making decisions that move metrics even when they compromise user experience. Princeton found that <a href=""https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/dark-patterns-examples"">1 in 10 of 11,000 shopping sites</a> used dark patterns. Zurich University found 95% of popular Android apps had at least one dark pattern. The European Commission found 97% of apps used by EU consumers contained dark patterns.</p><p>These aren’t isolated bad actors. These are systemic outcomes when growth imperatives override design principles, and designers lack the technical fluency to advocate effectively in those conversations.</p><p>The root cause is simple: most product decisions are fundamentally technical. They involve technical constraints, technical trade-offs, technical debt, and technical feasibility. If you can’t participate in technical conversations, you can’t influence product strategy. You can’t influence product strategy, you end up in alignment meetings explaining user needs to people making technical decisions you don’t fully understand.</p><p>This is why the handoff happened. Not because AI replaced designers. Because designers couldn’t articulate why technical decisions should consider user impact in language that resonated with the people making those decisions.</p><h3>This Isn’t About Coding</h3><p>Let me be crystal clear: this is not an argument that designers should learn to code production software.</p><p>This is about strategic literacy. Understanding enough about technical systems to make informed design decisions and advocate effectively for users when those decisions are being made.</p><p>There’s a difference between writing production code and understanding what code does. Between implementing a database schema and knowing why data models influence user workflows. Between configuring a build pipeline and recognizing when technical debt is accumulating in ways that will limit future design possibilities.</p><p>Strategic literacy means you can:</p><ul><li>Evaluate whether AI-generated code is functional or broken</li><li>Understand API constraints well enough to design features that are actually feasible</li><li>Recognize when performance implications should influence interaction patterns</li><li>Participate in technical debt conversations because you understand what’s being traded off</li><li>Spot when “technical constraints” are actually implementation choices masquerading as limitations</li></ul><p>The design engineers who maintained influence through the 2024–2025 crisis weren’t necessarily writing backend services. But they understood technical systems deeply enough to design with constraints in mind, advocate for users in technical conversations, and ship work that didn’t require wholesale engineering rewrites.</p><p><a href=""https://vercel.com/blog/design-engineering-at-vercel"">Rauno Freiberg at Vercel</a> describes his role as providing “the Design team with Engineering firepower to lead and ship our own projects end-to-end.” <a href=""https://ui.land/interviews/paco-coursey"">Paco Coursey at Linear</a> says design and code don’t feel separate to him. These aren’t people who abandoned design for engineering. They’re people who refused to treat design as separate from implementation.</p><p>The counter-argument is always gatekeeping: requiring technical knowledge excludes people from design. But what actually excludes people is creating a professional track that leads to strategic irrelevance. Roger Wong’s research shows entry-level hiring has collapsed. Matt Ström warns that if we don’t train junior designers now, we’ll have no senior designers for complex work AI can’t do. Design Week points out that students aren’t being equipped with essential technical skills.</p><p>We told designers they didn’t need technical knowledge. Then we eliminated their jobs when they couldn’t influence technical decisions. That’s not inclusion. That’s malpractice.</p><p>The question isn’t whether designers should code. The question is whether designers should understand the medium they’re designing for. Whether they should be able to evaluate their own work. Whether they should have enough technical fluency to advocate for users when technical decisions are being made.</p><p>That’s the baseline for strategic relevance.</p><h3>What Changes</h3><p>The opportunity here is clearer than the design industry wants to admit: technical understanding is learnable, and the designers who develop it will have influence that others don’t.</p><p>Look at what technical literacy enables. <a href=""https://www.bbva.com/en/airbnb-design-thinking-success-story/"">At Airbnb</a>, a designer studying the star rating system realized replacing stars with hearts could feel more personal. That design change increased bookings by more than 30%. Not because the designer had great visual taste. Because the designer understood the technical system well enough to identify a high-leverage intervention.</p><p>At <a href=""https://medium.com/@broccolini/design-systems-at-github-c8e5378d2542"">GitHub</a>, designers contribute production code to the Primer design system. They don’t do this because they want to be engineers. They do it because understanding the technical implementation makes them better designers. They can prototype with real constraints, collaborate with engineers as peers, and ship work that actually functions.</p><p>Vercel’s design engineering team operates with “aesthetic sensibility with technical skills,” which allows them to “deeply understand a problem, then design, build, and ship a solution autonomously.” This isn’t a replacement for traditional design — it’s an expansion of what design can influence.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Vercel’s design engineering"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3IIzfKxMtEWgJwU93GFyaw.png"" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=""https://vercel.com/blog/design-engineering-at-vercel"">https://vercel.com/blog/design-engineering-at-vercel</a></figcaption></figure><p>The technical skills that matter most:</p><ul><li>Understanding data models and how they constrain user workflows</li><li>Knowing enough about APIs to design technically feasible features</li><li>Recognizing performance bottlenecks that should influence interaction patterns</li><li>Evaluating AI-generated outputs for technical correctness</li><li>Understanding how design systems map to component libraries</li><li>Participating in build-versus-buy discussions with actual technical context</li></ul><p>None of this requires a computer science degree. It requires curiosity about how things actually work and a willingness to learn technical fundamentals.</p><p>The designers maintaining strategic influence through 2024–2025 aren’t the ones with the best Figma skills. They’re the ones who can participate in technical conversations, evaluate trade-offs, and advocate for users in language that resonates with engineers and product leaders.</p><p>This is the path forward. Not back to “designers should code” debates from the 2010s. Forward to “designers should understand the systems they’re designing for” as a baseline professional expectation.</p><h3>The Reckoning</h3><p>When Figma’s AI generated Apple Weather app clones, it revealed that many designers couldn’t articulate what made a design original beyond surface aesthetics. When Figma Sites produced <a href=""https://adrianroselli.com/2025/05/do-not-publish-your-designs-on-the-web-with-figma-sites.html"">210 WCAG violations</a>, it showed that accessibility knowledge wasn’t widespread enough to catch obviously broken output. <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/ai-generated-ux-and-the-growing-accessibility-debt-how-to-fix-it-8109fda7d9d5"">Research shows</a> that 81% of homepages have low-contrast text, and when AI trains on this data, it perpetuates systemic exclusion. When Builder.ai collapsed after six years of pretending AI was doing what engineers actually did, it demonstrated how easy it is to fake technical competence in an industry that stopped valuing technical craft.</p><p>The designers who maintained influence through this period share one thing: technical depth. Not necessarily coding ability, but deep understanding of technical systems. They can evaluate AI output. They can participate in architecture discussions. They can advocate for users in technical terms that actually influence decisions.</p><p>The designers who lost influence — and there were many, given 150,000+ layoffs — often shared a different trait: they treated design as separate from implementation. They created mockups for engineers to “build.” They relied on tools without understanding outputs. They couldn’t evaluate technical trade-offs or participate meaningfully in technical conversations.</p><p>The question facing the industry isn’t whether AI will replace designers. It’s whether designers will develop the technical literacy needed to remain strategically relevant in a world where most product decisions are fundamentally technical.</p><p>Some will argue this sets the bar too high. That requiring technical understanding excludes people. But what actually excludes people is creating a professional track that leads to irrelevance. Entry-level hiring has collapsed. Design leadership roles are disappearing. The “Great Design Handoff” already happened, and it wasn’t to AI — it was to growth teams, algorithms, and business stakeholders who could at least speak the technical language of trade-offs and constraints.</p><figure><img alt=""A venn diagram showing what is design engineering."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pQ35G-p558gX5yK0L8l1gQ.avif"" /><figcaption>Image Source: <a href=""https://maggieappleton.com/design-engineers"">https://maggieappleton.com/design-engineers</a></figcaption></figure><p>The industry told designers they didn’t need to understand implementation. Then eliminated their influence when they couldn’t participate in implementation discussions. That’s not AI’s fault. That’s ours.</p><p>The technical reckoning is here. The designers who face it with curiosity about how systems actually work will have opportunities the industry hasn’t seen in years. The designers who keep insisting technical knowledge isn’t their job will find that strategic influence isn’t theirs either.</p><p>The choice, as always, is ours to make.</p><p><em>What technical knowledge do you think designers need most?

<h4><em>WCAG color contrast is more than just text</em></h4><p>Most designers know the basics of web accessibility and color contrast. We’ve memorized that “normal text” (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html#dfn-large-scale"">24 CSS pixels and below</a>) needs to meet a 4.5:1 contrast ratio with its background, and “large text” (greater than 24 CSS pixels) needs to meet a 3:1 ratio.</p><p><strong>But WCAG (</strong><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/""><strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</strong></a><strong>) color contrast requirements don’t stop at text.</strong> There are lesser known WCAG success criteria (or “rules”) that are still very important for inclusive design; these ensure interfaces are usable to users with low vision or color blindness.</p><figure><img alt=""Viewing YouTube’s homepage with different vision simulations, like red-green color blindness and sun-glare"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-l5gevfqLDE88Ha5TisA6g.png"" /><figcaption>Viewing YouTube’s homepage with different vision simulations, like red-green color blindness</figcaption></figure><p>Some of these forgotten requirements circle around UI components, inline links, and data visualizations, which all have color contrast rules of their own. When these details are overlooked, users can’t tell what’s interactive, what’s linked, or what the data is actually saying (even if all the text uses accessible colors).</p><p>And these accessibility gaps aren’t edge cases. They show up in mature Design Systems, enterprise products, and well-intentioned designs because they live outside the accessibility standards designers tend to learn and adopt.</p><p>To avoid these gaps for the future, let’s go over 3 ongoing color contrast issues, how WCAG applies beyond text, and who exactly is impacted by color contrast.</p><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: I reference WCAG 2.1, Level AA standards. If your product needs to comply with Level AAA, required color contrast ratios increase (i.e., </em><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-enhanced.html""><em>normal text needs a 7:1 ratio</em></a><em> with its background).</em></blockquote><h3>UI components that look accessible (but aren’t)</h3><p>WCAG criteria: <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html"">SC 1.4.11: Non-Text Contrast (Level AA)</a></p><p>In plain english, this WCAG criteria requires that non-text UI elements that are interactive or communicate meaning have a <strong>minimum of 3:1 contrast ratio</strong> against adjacent colors (like the UI background).</p><p>But what is covered by “UI elements”? Basically, anything that a user can interact with or needs to see to use; such as:</p><ul><li>Buttons and button states</li><li>Form fields and their borders</li><li>Checkboxes, radio buttons, and toggles</li><li>Focus indicators</li><li>Icons that convey meaning or affordance</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Spirit includes text fields that do not meet contrast requirements with a 1.6:1 ratio"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mzlbjZWOHK27EOSS3N1QaQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.spirit.com/flight-status""><em>Spirit</em></a><em> includes text fields that do not meet contrast requirements with a 1.6:1 ratio; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong>Important note</strong><em>: If color contrast fails WCAG standards from the Design System level, the failure is replicated across all product adopters; it’s critical to check system UI component’s color contrast.</em></blockquote><h4>What designers miss and why it matters</h4><p>This is where many designs that are intended to be accessible quietly fail. Since these UI elements don’t contain text, they’re excluded from color contrast checks. And yes, text is very important to check, but so are the UI elements that provide any product its functionality.</p><p><strong>Common gaps within UI elements include:</strong></p><ul><li>Input borders that blend into the product background</li><li>Custom focus indicators that rely on subtle color shifts instead of high-contrast</li><li>Icon-only controls (like buttons) that don’t meet contrast on their own</li></ul><p><strong>When UI elements lack minimum contrast, users can’t reliably:</strong></p><ul><li>Identify what’s interactive or understand UI component states (like hover)</li><li>Navigate interfaces using only their keyboard</li><li>Complete forms without repetitive errors</li></ul><figure><img alt=""BBC includes a primary CTA that meets contrast requirements with a 4.58:1 ratio"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9lBpa8t8UhfH8HfsgOkvOQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.bbc.com/""><em>BBC</em></a><em> includes a primary CTA that meets contrast requirements with a 4.58:1 ratio; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><h4>Who are the users impacted?</h4><p>Though low-contrast UI elements affect everyone at some capacity (you might have to do some squinting), they make products unusable to people like:</p><ul><li>Users with low vision who need distinct visual styling</li><li>Keyboard users who depend on focus indicators that stand-out on the UI</li><li>Older users experiencing reduced contrast sensitivity</li><li>Users in low-contrast environments (i.e., sun-glare, small screens, fluorescent lights)</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: To check a UI component’s contrast (or any element that needs contrast), you can also use </em><a href=""https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-disability-simulator/olioanlbgbpmdlgjnnampnnlohigkjla?hl=en&amp;pli=1""><em>Web Disability Simulator</em></a><em> on any web page to simulate how it looks for users with color-blindness or cognitive disabilities.</em></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Red-green color blind simulation on YouTube with the Web Disability Simulator Chrome extension"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QWZyIWC5rf7neuUBx-RhKQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Red-green color blind simulation on </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/""><em>YouTube</em></a><em> with the </em><a href=""https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-disability-simulator/olioanlbgbpmdlgjnnampnnlohigkjla?hl=en&amp;pli=1""><em>Web Disability Simulator</em></a><em> Chrome extension</em></figcaption></figure><h3>Data visualizations with low contrast</h3><p>WCAG criteria: <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html"">SC 1.4.11: Non-Text Contrast (Level AA)</a></p><p>This accessibility gap references the same WCAG standard as UI components from above.

But not only that, inline links also must have <strong>at least 3:1 contrast</strong> against surrounding body text to be distinguishable (especially when the link doesn’t have an additional visual cue, <a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/F73.html"">like an underline or bold font weight</a>).</p><figure><img alt=""Atlanta’s Department of Transportation includes inline links that do not meet contrast requirements with a 1.58:1 ratio"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*k_84e7wKBM0IOAXis1ljeA.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://atldot.atlantaga.gov/""><em>Atlanta’s Department of Transportation</em></a><em> includes inline links that do not meet contrast requirements with a 1.58:1 ratio; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><h4>What designers miss and why it matters</h4><p>Inline links are such simple and subtle UI components; it’s easy to miss the checks needed to ensure accessibility. Designers typically think that since a paragraph of text meets the 4.5:1 color ratio requirement, any inline link using the same text color within the paragraph also passes. Since links are interactive elements, they have additional guidelines other than passing the color requirements for text.</p><p><strong>Frequent issues with inline links include:</strong></p><ul><li>Links that are differentiated only by an underline when the link receive mouse hover or keyboard focus</li><li>Link colors that meet contrast against the background, but not against adjacent text</li><li>Underlines removed for aesthetic or simplicity reasons</li></ul><p><strong>When inline links aren’t clearly distinguishable, users can’t:</strong></p><ul><li>Easily comprehend what’s interactive (especially when hidden in body copy)</li><li>Efficiently navigate a website or product page</li><li>Find important actions or information they need to complete a task</li></ul><h4>Who are the users impacted?</h4><p>I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again… this affects all users at some capacity. Inline links are not as recognizable to any user when the underline affordance or high contrast color is taken away. But for some users, it becomes impossible to identify links that could lead the user to information or product pages they need.</p><p>Users to consider when designing inline links include:</p><ul><li>Color-blind users who may not perceive color differences</li><li>Users with low vision who require visual affordances with high contrast</li><li>Users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from consistent patterns</li><li>All users scanning content quickly</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: A simple rule of thumb is to make a link look like a link for optimal usability and accessibility.</em></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Gov.UK includes inline links that meets contrast requirements with a 3.81:1 ratio AND are underlined"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3rOPtaAXaJBwGlfl3wKXcg.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid""><em>Gov.UK</em></a><em> includes inline links that meets contrast requirements with a 3.81:1 ratio AND are underlined; calculated with </em><a href=""https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/""><em>WebAim’s Contrast Checker</em></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>UI components, inline links, and data visualizations often fall outside the mental checklist of color contrast and accessible design.</strong> WCAG covers these elements, but it’s often overlooked when focusing on adequate contrast for text. This leads to websites and interfaces that look high contrast, but are near impossible to use for some user groups.</p><p>By spreading awareness to these accessibility gaps, we can expand how we define color contrast and better apply ideal accessibility practices. When these requirements are built into components, patterns, and Design Systems from the start, accessibility stops being a last-minute fix (or remediation plan) and becomes part of the design process.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=68cc224735b3"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/3-color-contrast-mistakes-designers-still-make-68cc224735b3"">3 color contrast mistakes designers still make</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<p>I watch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/entertainment"">a lot of TV.</a> It’s my job. And in all my years of b<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/binge-watching-habit-meaning-psychology"">inge-watching shows</a> for a living, I have never seen so many viral videos of people <a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-season-3-watch-party-blue-haven-nyc-scene-report"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">gathered together in bars simultaneously yelling</a> in reaction to major TV moments than I have this year. In the age of streaming, appointment TV was back and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/love-island-usa-watch-parties-community"">watch parties were bigger</a> than ever. Whether it was <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@loveislandusa/video/7520444252002848055?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nicolandria’s Soul Ties kiss</a> (IYKYK), the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11934118/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-finale-ending-explained-review-belly"">king of yearning Conrad Fisher</a> finally getting his happily ever after, or a <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSe15yhDuu1/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">grand gesture from a gay hockey player</a> no one saw coming, TV lovers came together this year to obsess over their fave ‘ships and root for their beloved characters. And it was beautiful to witness. </p>



<p>In a year that felt endlessly chaotic and packed with horrific headlines, TV stepped up as our most reliable emotional support system. 2025 gave us shows that made us scream-text the group chat, cancel plans for<em> just one more episode</em>, and rethink everything from love, to friendship, to what counts as a satisfying finale. Whether you were into <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/07/203712/best-2000s-shows-platinum-age"">prestige dramas</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cozy-christmas-movies"">comfort watches</a>, or genre shows that completely rewired the formula, this year’s best TV did not disappoint. Below are the series that defined our screens, our moods, and cured our collective cultural brain rot.</p>



<p>These picks come straight from the watchlists (and our unhinged yet professional Slack chats) of Refinery29 editors. The criteria isn’t “high-brow only,” it’s <em>did this show fully consume us?</em> From series that demanded our full attention to reality TV that went from chaotic to comforting to culturally essential, we’re honoring the full spectrum of what great TV looks like. If it sparked a debate, delivered a meme, or made us feel something unexpectedly real, it earned its spot. </p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq8x47ky2Tw"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Pitt </a></em></strong></h2>







<p>For some reason, I was never into Grey’s Anatomy, Scrubs, ER, or any of the popular hospital dramas even during their streaming resurgences. But after everyone from family to strangers recommended watching <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11936018/the-pitt-season-2-characters-storyline-release-date"">The Pitt</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11936018/the-pitt-season-2-characters-storyline-release-date""> </a>(starring and executive-produced by ER’s very own Noah Wyle) and being bombarded with interviews of Wylie talking about how his nurse mom influenced the storyline for more accurate depictions of what it’s actually like to work in a hospital, I finally gave in. And wow, was I stunned. </p>



<p>Each of the 15 episodes represent one hour of a consecutive 15-hour emergency room shift. It’s fast-paced and chaotic but has moments of levity, and manages to dive deep into each of the doctors, nurses, and residents’ eccentricities and back stories. I found myself instantly hooked and invested into the core doctors and incoming patients, no matter how likeable, unlikeable, long, or short their storylines were. The heavy, high-strung, high-stakes series is a must-watch. But to warn you, it is certainly not a show to wind down to after a hectic day!<em> <strong>– Victoria Montalti, Senior Fashion Writer</strong></em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.peacocktv.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Love Island USA</a> </em>Season 7 </strong></h2>







<p>When an Irish friend first introduced me to <em>Love Island </em>via the show’s original UK iteration in 2022, I was equally horrified and intrigued by the sheer logistics of it all. The idea of committing to a show that airs a new episode six nights a week for two and a half months straight — featuring a revolving door of 30-or-so contestants and their constantly recalibrating romances — was a lot to wrap my head around. But, as someone who deeply appreciates lowbrow reality TV both as a form of sociological fieldwork and, obviously, for pure eye candy, I was up for the task. </p>



<p>This year, <em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hZpwgKjOkY"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Love Island USA</a></em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hZpwgKjOkY"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> season 7</a> brought the country together in ways seldom seen before, becoming a full-blown cultural phenomenon that revived the glory days of participatory reality TV. My roommate and I grew closer as we watched and voted together each night (and shrieked in horror at the show’s absolutely unhinged challenges). My colleagues and I raced to our Slack channels each morning to share hot takes. Even in New York City, where people famously mind their business, I’d find myself talking about the show with a friend on the street or subway, only to have strangers jump in mid-conversation to share their opinions.</p>



<p>What ultimately made season 7 feel like a classic was (most of) the cast’s emotional vulnerability. It gave us a hero’s arc in Amaya Papaya (née Espinal), who brought a rare level of authenticity and sensitivity to reality TV, a friends-to-star-crossed-lovers romance in Olandria and Nic, healthy debates about what it really means to be “a girls girl,” and enough memes to last a lifetime (Mamacita, anyone?). <em><strong>– Lia Tabackman, Senior Social Media Manager </strong></em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@hbomax/video/7583017214677241119"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Heated Rivalry</a></em></strong></h2>







<p>I’m going to start with a quote from <em><a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/heated-rivalry-hbo-max-gay-drama-hockey-players-hit-women-1236456083/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Heated Rilvarly’s</a></em> creator, writer and showrunner, Jacob Tierney: “Putting queer sex on the screen in a celebratory and sexy way is not common at all… people were clearly craving that kind of thing,” <a href=""https://theankler.com/p/i-think-heated-rivalry-deserves-emmys"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tierney told The Ankler</a>. “They wanted to see sexually alive, queer people in a way that we kind of self-censor and don’t always do. I don’t think the show is popular despite the horniness; I think it’s popular because of the horniness.” Exactly. Recently, TV and film have been oddly sexless, seemingly scared to show erotism on screen and convinced audiences don’t want to see pretty people kissing. I beg to differ.</p>



<p>I’ve been pushing the horny TV agenda for years and finally, here comes a show to match my freak. But it’s not just about the beautifully tender, explicit, real, and <em>hot </em>sex scenes, <em>Heated Rivalry </em>contains some of the most heartfelt and romantic storytelling I’ve ever seen on TV. And that’s only after five episodes! I am already unhealthily obsessed with this show and I can’t wait for more. As someone who belongs to multiple romance book clubs, I’m so happy that a show based on a romance novel (written by Rachel Reid) is getting the love it deserves. Plus, a show about gay hockey players airing in 2025 — when male athletes would still face so much prejudice, homophobia, and an extremely hard time if they came out IRL — is not only bold and brave, it’s revolutionary.  – <em>Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Senior Content Director, Entertainment </em><br /></p>

<p>I admittedly didn’t watch much TV this year, but there was one show that had me in a chokehold: Season 3 of <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty.</em> To be honest, I didn’t particularly enjoy this season. As Team Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno), a lot of it was insufferable, mostly because Conrad (Christopher Briney) remains an unbearable character to watch. He’s going to talk down to Belly (Lola Tung) and make her feel crazy for years AND do his brother like that, and they still want me to believe he’s not the villain in this show? (You ain’t gaslighting me, Connie Baby!). I also couldn’t stand the way the writers seemed determined to assassinate Jeremiah’s character. Still, to paraphrase a Taylor Swift lyric, Jenny Han really puts narcotics into all of her episodes, because no matter how much I wanted to look away, I just couldn’t. <em>– Raquel Reichard, Director of Somos</em></p>



<h2><em><a href=""https://www.netflix.com/browse"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The</a></em><a href=""https://www.netflix.com/browse"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> </a><strong><em><a href=""https://www.netflix.com/browse"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hunting Wives </a></em></strong></h2>







<p>When I first started <em>The Hunting Wives</em>, I wasn’t prepared for what I signed up for. I assumed I would be watching a show about wives getting back at their cheating husbands. I was right, but also so wrong. I spent most of the time being mad at the main character Sophie (Brittany Snow), literally rolling my eyes at the screen at her antics. That said, I will be back for Season 2. –<em> Dawnie Jefferson Production &amp; Editorial Coordinator</em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/secretlivesonhulu/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives </a></em></strong></h2>







<p><em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSky3regZqi/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives</a> </em>was my favorite TV show of 2025 because it didn’t just understand the assignment, it overdelivered. TWO seasons in one year? Bravo could never. By breaking the fourth wall and letting the off-screen drama (hello, Fruity Pebbles) bleed into the show, it captured the same raw magic as early Vanderpump Rules seasons, back when the cast wanted fame at any cost and didn’t know, or care, to hold anything back.</p>



<p>Season 3 was filmed before Season 2 even premiered, giving us something almost unheard of in reality TV: reunions being taped, press tours unfolding, and cast dynamics shifting in real time as they reacted to public opinion. The timeline was messy, but for reality fans, that level of transparency was all we’ve ever wanted.</p>



<p>We watched marriages implode, secret affairs surface, and learned way too much about their sex lives. Not every storyline worked (the sexual assault allegations were uncomfortable and difficult to watch), but the drama was balanced by something real: raw, unprocessed trauma shared in a way that genuinely resonated.</p>



<p>Taylor Frankie Paul becoming the Bachelorette only cemented the show’s chokehold on pop culture, while Whitney Leavitt started the year as the ultimate villain and ended it as the main character of<em> Dancing with the Stars </em>and getting cast as Roxie Hart on Broadway. The range! And all of this unfolded in the hyper-specific, endlessly fascinating playground of Swig sodas, Utah curls, and Mormon culture—proof that you don’t need alcohol for reality TV gold.<em> – Taylor Loren, Social Strategist </em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/81418639"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Forever</a> </em></strong></h2>







<p>Mara Brock Akil’s <em>Forever</em> feels like it was made specifically for me — for the 16 year old version of me who needed to see herself, who longed for stories that reflected Black girlhood and humanity and the complexity of being a Black kid in a white space — and that’s only partially why I loved it so much. For the teenager in me who was messily figuring out her sexuality, Keisha and Justin would have been my fictional best friends. For the thirty-redacted grownup who needed an escape and just loves romance, <em>Forever</em> delivered in-depth, nuanced explorations of how sex can be absolutely everything and sometimes nothing at all. </p>



<p>Listen, I’m too grown to believe that representation will save us, but it does matter. And what this show represents (Black kids falling in love and finding themselves) is portrayed in such a caring, thoughtful way that as you fall in love with Keisha and Justin, as a Black person, you can’t help but love yourself more. This show loves us. It finds beauty in Blackness, in the nuances and flaws of youth. It lets Keisha be complicated and messy and Justin be introspective and vulnerable; two things that Black girls and boys aren’t typically allowed to be on TV. This show is my wildest dreams come true. It’s the show I wish I had when I was a teenager and I’m so grateful that Black teens get this show now. – <em>Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Senior Content Director, Entertainment </em><br /></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://abc.com/show/e4f28254-2fc4-4cc1-b9bb-eee0564c178e"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Abbott Elementary</a> </em>Season 5</strong></h2>







<p><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/01/10828529/abbott-elementary-show-review-quinta-brunson"">Abbott Elementary</a></em> is my comfort show when I want to just laugh and <em>not have to think</em>. I can usually jump into any episode in the season or binge several of the 22-minute episodes and still understand what’s happening. In the same style as cult-favorite comedies like<em> The Office</em> and <em>Parks &amp; Rec,</em> this workplace “mockumentary” follows the staff of a Philadelphia elementary school and captures all the drama and antics you’d expect to happen during everyday life—in and out of school. The show is currently in the middle of season five and we see teachers Janine and Gregory’s relationship continue to develop. A few of the recent episodes have taken the setting out of the school, but my favorites are usually when the teachers and staff, especially Principal Ava Coleman and teacher Ms. Melissa Schementti, are just trying to get through the school day. For me, it’s easy sitcom watching. –<em> Lisa Dionisio, Newsletter Director</em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/81427733"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Beast In Me</a></em></strong></h2>







<p>If I were putting together a dream team of prestige TV, I would immediately call up Claire Danes and Matthew Rhys for my starting five. Danes proved in <em>Homeland</em>, and throughout her storied career, that she can do a chin quiver like no other, and that there is no emotion she can’t convey through the careful crumpling of her face. And Rhys, along with his real-life wife Keri Russell, showed on <em>The Americans</em> that he can make even the most ethically-questionable character someone you can’t help but be intrigued by. In <em>The Beast In Me</em>, these two heavyweights come together for some of the best TV of the year. </p>



<p>Both Danes and Rhys are so compelling in <em>The Beast In Me, </em>you won’t be able to look away for all eight episodes. Danes brings her signature emotional precision, playing every flicker of doubt and defiance like a controlled burn, while Rhys does what he does best: make moral ambiguity feel devastatingly human. Together, they create a push-pull dynamic that’s an unsettling dissertation on good versus evil and what happens when the lines between the two start to blue. Their chemistry isn’t flashy; it’s claustrophobic, simmering, and kind that makes silence feel louder than dialogue and turns every shared glance into a threat. It’s prestige acting without the self-importance, and it’s exactly why the show gets under your skin and stays there. – <em>Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Senior Content Director, Entertainment </em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaDFty5ipEg"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Buccanneers</a> </em>Season 2</strong></h2>







<p>This past summer, I was indulging in some YA love-triangle drama and watching <em>TSITP</em> and<em> The Buccaneers</em> Season 2 on Apple TV. If you’re not familiar with The Buccaneers, it’s a period drama set in 1870s England following five gorgeous American women trying to find titled husbands and independence. Season 2 tries to resolve a love triangle set up in Season 1 between Nan, Guy, and Theo. New affairs and betrayals between the couples develop, and it’s guilty-pleasure watching, especially for period romance fans. Spoiler warning: season two ends in another cliffhanger but the show’s already been greenlit for a season three.<em> – Lisa Dionisio, Newsletter Director</em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://tubitv.com/series/300014710/the-z-suite"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Z Suite </a></em></strong></h2>







<p>I know Tubi gets a bad rep for its content, but do NOT sleep on them. I loved everything about the Z Suite! The characters were fun. The plots were full of shenanigans. It fueled the Gen Z vs. Millennial fire in a way that leaves you with the idea, “we are more alike than different”. It had a sense of true comedic whimsy, while many other shows are just too serious. I am unsure if it will be renewed for another season, but I sure hope so! —<em> Dawnie Jefferson Production &amp; Editorial Coordinator</em></p>

Brown about a secret service agent whose president is murdered and it’s so good, it got renewed for a <a href=""https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/a64208545/paradise-season-2-news-date-cast-spoilers/"">second season</a> halfway into its first. So I’m just going to quote myself from March writing about <em>Paradise</em> just after it was renewed: “We’re in an age where a show with a Black lead gets written off by online trolls as ‘<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/02/11253627/woke-meaning-co-opted-politics"">too woke</a>’ or full of ‘<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/03/11844306/hollywood-dei-rollbacks-black-actors-cast-reboots-racism"">DEI hires</a>’ and anything that makes us feel our feelings gets denigrated as ‘silly.’ But the absurdity and sincerity of <em>Paradise</em> is its strength. And its hero? A Black man, the descendent of a Tuskegee airman and Black pilot, who took a bullet for the president, may feel a bit too nationalistic for the current moment, but it also harkens back to a time when that guy was the hero everyone welcomed, and the one TV wanted. Right now, Sterling K. Brown as Xavier Collins is the hero we need.” – <em>Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Senior Content Director, Entertainment </em></p>

<p>This year marked Season 4 and 5 of <em>Ghosts</em>, and it is consistently one of my favorite comfort watches. I literally force anyone who comes to my house to watch it with me. Season 4 gave the characters so much more backstory. Season 5 adds to that. If you want a good, wholesome chuckle, you should definitely watch this show. –<em> Dawnie Jefferson Production &amp; Editorial Coordinator</em></p>

Whether you’re leaning into the coziness of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-faux-fur-coats-jackets"">faux-fur coat</a> or the versatility of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/womens-fall-jackets"">trench coat</a>, the right winter topper can transform even the simplest look into a moment. <br /><br />This season, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-fashion-beauty-trends-forecast-2025-2026"">top winter trends</a> point towards bold plaids (or even more dramatic checks), animal print (yes, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-leopard-print-2"">leopard print</a> is always in fashion), and winter whites (to channel Pantone’s Color of the Year: Cloud Dancer). And for silhouettes, it’s time to pull out your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cape-coats-jackets-trend"">scarf jackets</a> from a couple seasons back (or invest in a new one) and bundle up in funnel-neck designs (that don’t require a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/oversized-scarf"">chunky scarf</a>). <br /><br />Whether you’re looking for an elevated coat to wear over <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-wedding-guest-dresses-outfits"">winter wedding guest dresses</a> or a cozy cropped jacket to pair with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-matching-sweatsuits-womens"">lounge sets</a>, you can brave the cold in style and ring in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-years-eve-nail-art-designs"">the new year</a> with a trendy winter coat. </p>

<h2>Plaid Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952061.png?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The winter calls for festive plaids, especially on your outerwear. This season, the closet mainstay is refreshed with punchier colors and unexpected silhouettes. Think: vibrant color combos, blazers, and bomber jackets. We’re especially eyeing reversible jacket designs that can transform with different outfits and seasons. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Scarf Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952078.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>It seems like every It-girl on our feeds and on the streets is wearing a scarf coat. The bundled-up silhouette trended a couple years back — briefly overtaken by the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cape-coats-jackets-trend"">cape jacket</a> — and is back at the forefront. Wear the scarves loosely hanging down or wrapped snugly around your neck (and look out for versatile coats with detachable scarves). </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Winter White Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952100.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>A winter essential that’s equal parts cozy and cool, a white coat should be in your closet (or in your shopping cart), especially thanks to Pantone’s Cloud Dancer color and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hm-perfect-moment-collaboration"">après-ski aesthetic</a>. The best part is that you can go down any route, from sporty <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-puffer-jacket"">puffer jackets</a> and wool cropped coats to faux fur zip-ups and wrap trenches.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Funnel Neck Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952122.png?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Funnel neck coats are one of those <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2025-trends"">runway trends</a> that are <em>actually</em> wearable IRL. The exaggerated high necks aren’t just dramatic, they’re also practical for keeping the wind and snow from ruining your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-makeup-looks"">winter makeup looks</a>. You can find the trendy silhouette across leather jackets, wool dress coats, and even longline vests.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Animal Print Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952143.png?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>Nothing says winter glamour like a faux-fur coat. And an <em>animal print</em> faux-fur coat is an even more bold and playful option. While you can’t go wrong with classic leopards and cheetahs, more unexpected animal prints — like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-cow-print"">cow</a>, zebra, deer, giraffe, and even snow leopard — are trending. (And be sure to also look out for non-furry fabrics that can be worn cross-seasonally.)</p>

<p>It’s 2010. I’m 13 years old and I’m on my way to what I <em>know</em> will be one of the craziest nights of my life: <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/justin-bieber-announces-my-world-tour-first-headlining-trek-958949/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Justin Bieber </a><em><a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/justin-bieber-announces-my-world-tour-first-headlining-trek-958949/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">My World 2.0</a></em><a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/justin-bieber-announces-my-world-tour-first-headlining-trek-958949/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> Tour.</a> As I crank my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-hair-straightening-tools"">hair straightener</a> up way too high (RIP to my ends), I pause mid-section and wonder: <em>What am I missing? What would truly make Justin fall in love with me? </em>And then it hits me: my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/favorite-perfumes-editors-picks"">vanilla cupcake perfume</a> from Claire’s.</p>



<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fragrance"">perfume is aggressively sugary</a> and smells like straight icing. All my mom could hear from downstairs was <em>sksksksksks</em> as I drowned myself in it, fully convinced that if Justin couldn’t see me from the stage, he would at least smell me. And well, not to spoil the ending, but… he did not fall in love with me that night. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2018/11/217863/justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-marriage-confirmed"">Congrats, Hailey</a>!</p>



<p>What <em>did</em> happen, though, was far more consequential: that was the night I fell in love with gourmand fragrances, specifically, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-7-virtues-vanilla-woods-perfume-fragrance-review"">vanilla</a>. I never cared what brand it was, as long as the bottle starts with <em>buttery</em>, <em>whipped</em>, or <em>sugar</em>, I was in.</p>



<p>Life was going great until one day, a coworker casually mentions that my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/perfume-fragrance-editor-favorites"">favorite fragrance</a> reminds her of what it smells like to be a child. Suddenly, I was overthinking everything. Was I still that 13-year-old hoping to be noticed by JB, or did my signature scent simply need a rebrand?</p>



<p>Turns out, it was both.</p>



<p>When I heard that <a href=""https://thesoapandglory.com/""><strong>Soap &amp; Glory</strong></a> dropped a brand-new, mood-boosting fragrance line, I was intrigued. It covers pretty much every palette. There’s <a href=""https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/soap-%26-glory-body-mist-tropical-sunrise/ID=300462740-product""><strong>Tropical Sunrise</strong></a> with pineapple and coconut, <a href=""https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/soap-%26-glory-body-mist-orchid-bliss/ID=300462734-product""><strong>Orchid Bliss</strong></a> with orchid and sandalwood, <a href=""http://walgreens.com/store/c/soap-%26-glory-body-mist-radiant-rose/ID=300462747-product""><strong>Radiant Rose</strong></a> with florals and bergamot, <a href=""https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/soap-%26-glory-body-mist-watermelon-spritz/ID=300462746-product""><strong>Watermelon Spritz</strong></a> for something bright and juicy, and of course <a href=""https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/soap-%26-glory-body-mist-vanilla-licious/ID=300462744-product""><strong>Vanilla-licious</strong></a> with warm caramel and vanilla notes. With a set with this much range, it’s perfect for mixing and matching. And with each fragrance under $20, it felt like the perfect chance to find my signature scent and actually play around with layering.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952221.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=491&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A491"" /></figure>



<p>Since I hadn’t elevated my fragrance in nearly 20 years, I tapped the internet’s favorite fragrance guru, <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@paulreactss?lang=en""><strong>Paul Fino</strong></a>, for advice on how to layer scents and whether I can keep being a vanilla girl at my big age. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<p><strong>Unbothered: So talk to me about vanilla. Do you think it’s having a moment right now? And do you think it’s one of those scents that transcends seasons, like a year-round thing?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Fino:</strong> Yeah, for sure. Vanilla is year-round for me because there are so many vanilla-adjacent scents. You can find vanillas that lean super creamy, more floral, or even more powdery. That said, vanilla is definitely most popular in fall and winter. People love warm gourmands in colder months, and in summer they usually want something more tropical, fruity, or fresh. But vanilla is not going anywhere. It’s had its moment and it’s become one of those things that just sticks around.</p>



<p><strong>My coworker said vanilla is childish. So when you see something like Vanilla-licious, which feels more grown and sexy but still has that inner-child sweetness, how do you elevate it? How do you layer it so you don’t smell like cupcake perfume from Limited Too?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> I 100% get that. A lot of gourmand vanillas can lean artificial or very young. When people say they want a “mature” vanilla, I get it, but “mature” doesn’t mean grandma. It can mean deeper, sexier, more attractive. One of my favorite ways to elevate Vanilla-licious is pairing it with Radiant Rose. Radiant Rose is basically their iconic signature scent, but repackaged and made a little newer and fresher. Rose is romantic, and it deepens the vanilla. The musk in both helps them blend really beautifully. That vanilla-rose combination is gorgeous.</p>



<p><strong>I feel like layering fragrance is like cooking. You wouldn’t put mustard and jelly together. So how do you know what works? What’s the science of scent layering, especially for someone new who wants to smell unique but still wearable?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> It’s all about understanding notes and scent families. I can usually predict how something will smell based on the notes and how many fragrances I’ve experienced, but a simple rule is to keep things in similar scent profiles if you want to play it safe. Sweets with sweets, gourmands with gourmands. For example, vanilla with pineapple and coconut makes sense because it’s tropical sweet. Vanilla and coconut always work together, so Vanilla-licious with Tropical Sunrise is an easy layering combo.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952222.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p><strong>What about combinations that are risky?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> Sometimes mixing two different ends of the spectrum can clash, but sometimes a clash is exactly what makes it interesting. That’s how you get people to ask, “What are you wearing?” Also, fragrance wears differently on everyone, so experimentation matters.</p>



<p><strong>Are these meant to be layered only with each other, or can you layer them with perfumes too?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> You can absolutely layer these with perfumes. They’re body mists, but they have really good projection and longevity, especially for the price point. They’re great as base layers.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have a method for layering? Like an order you follow?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong>Yes. I do heaviest to lightest. I start with my deepest scent first, like a heavy wood or musk, then layer lighter scents on top. It’s kind of like how fragrance is built, with base notes, heart notes, and top notes.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952224.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>If someone just wants one scent from the line for self-care, like a shower that makes you feel calm and relaxed, which one is it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> Orchid Bliss. Hands down. If you want truly relaxing and calming, Orchid Bliss is the one. It’s slightly sweet, it has sandalwood, and there are also notes like vanilla and pistachio in there, but they feel more subtle and deeper in the background. It’s like a spa in a bottle.</p>



<p><strong>Why not Vanilla-licious for calm?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> Vanilla makes me feel confident. Like, super confident. Orchid Bliss gives more calm spa-night energy. If you’re tired, overworked, and want the most relaxing shower, I’d do scrub, wash, body butter, and spray in Orchid Bliss, then top it with your favorite perfume if you want extra oomph.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<p>After talking to Paul, I realized it was never really about retiring vanilla. It was about wearing it with intention. It was about keeping the sweetness but adding depth. It’s time to let my inner 13-year-old have her moment, while my grown self makes my scent feel polished. So yes, I’m still a vanilla girl. I’m just a vanilla girl with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/best-vanilla-perfume""><em>range</em></a> now.</p>

<p><em>Music journalist Kelly Washington travelled to the Playa Pacha at the FIVE Luxe Hotel to profile <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/peggygou_/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Peggy Gou</a>, the queen of K-House and techno. </em></p>



<p>It is around midnight at the Playa Pacha openair nightclub in the <a href=""https://luxejbr.fivehotelsandresorts.com/"">FIVE LUXE hotel in Dubai</a>. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/gerdjansonofficial/?hl=en"">German DJ Gerd Janson</a> has just dropped a remix of Stevie Nick’s “Edge Of Seventeen” when <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/article/dj-peggy-gou-interview"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Peggy Gou</a> appears next to him, diamond-clad in a <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/q_millinery/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Q Park Millinery</a> sparkly bandana, with a cat on the front reading “Mew Mew,” paired with a black two-piece. I am standing behind the decks, watching her slink into the space with her entourage, as the crowd reacts to her presence. Someone next to me breathlessly exclaims “queen”, in a way that seems involuntarily. As the crowd howls in unison and Gou clasps their hands, I am struck by how comfortable she looks.</p>



<p>It is hard to believe that once upon a time, Gou was just starting out in the underground scene; she seems as if she was plonked down on earth, already a successful 34-year-old, with her knowing, winning smile and covered in patchwork tattoos, cigarette in one hand, tending to the decks with the other. The ‘female DJ’ as an archetype has gone through many iterations, but never before has she propelled herself into mainstream stardom the way Peggy Gou has. In a short space of time, she achieved global fame, headlined major festivals like Coachella and Glastonbury, created global hits like “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCz5y84dwuA"">(It Goes Like) Nanana,</a>” and became the first Korean to play the <a href=""https://www.papermag.com/berghain-linux"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">world-renowned legacy club Berghain.</a> </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952202.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>The FIVE LUXE hotel is flooded with Brits escaping the December chill at home, as well as Americans, Russians, and other European clientele. Backed by the hotel’s luxury ecosystem project, the FIVE LUXE has a “do more with less” ethos and is 100% solar powered, making it the world’s highest-rated 5-Star Hotel green building under LEED v4 (the international standard for high-performance green buildings). FIVE’s service is the best I’ve ever experienced (even my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/winter-clothes-accessories-2025#slide-8"">battered Vagabond handbag</a> gets its own seat at every table), and I’m grateful I packed my <a href=""https://www.loopearplugs.com/products/swarovski"">Swarovski Loop ear plugs</a> (the only sparkly thing I own) so I just about fit in with the bold and flash crowd.</p>



<p>I ask Peggy to describe Dubai’s club scene in three words, to which she enthusiastically responds “energetic, diverse and growing!” Considering a huge 90% of the population are expats, she’s not wrong. FIVE’s Palm Jeremiah hotel (also in Dubai) even boasts its own recording studio, and with a club in Ibiza too, it’s clear the team has set their sights on Dubai as their next ultimate party destination. They have the cash, and they plan to spend it on the best talent money can buy; hosting the likes of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/carlcoxofficial/?hl=en"">Carl Cox</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/marcocarola/?hl=en"">Marco Carola </a>and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/solomun/?hl=en"">Solomun</a> at Playa Pacha. </p>



<p>When she was 18, Peggy Gou went to study at the <a href=""https://www.arts.ac.uk/colleges/london-college-of-fashion/study-at-lcf?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22332830344&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA-G_q8pyDEQVeFZGpmfJ8Qdf3lAZE&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA9aPKBhBhEiwAyz82J0Y4h9qKJbh7cGoshAwRUZaq-07o72iJKm9Ca2eli2Uxv2PBe2o4sxoCvVEQAvD_BwE"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">London College of Fashion</a> with hopes of becoming a designer, then a photographer, then a stylist. But she’d always been passionate about music, and eventually found a way to use her skills in fashion promotion to fill a gap in electronic music. While most house and techno DJs dress understated, she knew her style would play a pivotal role in her success once she began producing music and cutting her teeth at small venues in London and Berlin. I ask her why these grassroots spaces are important right now, and her critical eye shines: “Club culture continues to influence many aspects of creative industries far beyond music. Without grassroots and independent venues, we will lose the very foundations of electronic music as we know it,” Gou says. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Without grassroots and independent venues, we will lose the very foundations of electronic music as we know it.</p><cite>dj peggy gou</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Above all, Gou is a strategic and smart producer, and is incredibly intentional about what she puts out and why. Back in July 2018, I had just finished my undergraduate degree in Manchester in the UK, and a label called Defected Records reigned supreme among most of my friends who were into house music. It was on this label that Gou released a remix of Shakedown’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbf2JR422w"">“At Night (Peggy Gou’s Acid Journey Remix)”</a> that defined the summer. As catchy, accessible and pop-fluent as the chorus was, it never seemed to get old, and hit #1 on the UK Official Dance Singles Chart. Everywhere you went, the At Night remix was playing. The pulsing vocal could be heard from Manchester, to London, to party island Ibiza, often heard in a rendition similar to that of a football chant. With this single, Gou propelled herself into the dance music world, then onto the global stage, and hasn’t slowed down since. </p>



<p>Blowing up in electronic music as a woman, can be your best and worst nightmare all at once. Overnight, you are successful, impressive, and adored. But six months later you are likely to fall victim to criticism for <em>something</em>, like being too commercial or having rich parents. Her haters will say that she sold out, that once Peggy Gou had everyone feeling <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbf2JR422w"">“much better… at night</a>”, she was no longer the underground DJ sensation who cut her teeth in clubs in London and Berlin – they’d lost her to A-list status. Charli XCX touched on this in <a href=""https://itscharlibb.substack.com/p/the-death-of-cool"">her recent substack </a>titled “The Death of Cool.” XCX wrote, “I have always rejected the idea that art, film, persona or music becoming commercial means it cannot also be considered cool. The rejection of commerciality ‘just because’ is such a boring and immature argument that is perhaps more suited to some mediums than others but in general I find to be elitist in a way that does not thrill me whatsoever,” she continued. “Disliking something purely because of its widespread popularity or links to commercialism comes with a distinctly art school type energy that is super triggering to me.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952204.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>Charli XCX is right, artists can’t take this chatter personally – just because some fans in the electronic music space have a habit of tarnishing those who rise to success quickly, especially if you’re a woman. At the same time, it is not wholly uncommon to witness legends (often male), playing what can only be described as the worst set you’ve seen in your life, on no sleep, without consequence or fallout in the scene.</p>



<p>When cool points are gained on the basis of youth and niche references, mainstream success can become the enemy in certain circles. Once something transcends the underground, it transforms into something else entirely. But Peggy never forgot her roots; a genre-blending selector with range, she’s known for her energetic but composed sets. She often plays a combination of pulsing house, techno and break beats, dropping tunes from artists like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dj_seinfeld/"">DJ Seinfeld</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/andrezimmer_/?hl=en"">Andre Zimmer,</a> as well as hosting the likes of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dmx_krew/?hl=en"">DMX Krew</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/regularfantasy/"">Regularfantasy</a> on her label. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>… this is not just focused on the fact they’re women, they’re exceptionally talented and it’s important for me to use my platform to share that with the world.</p><cite>peggy gou on mentoring other djs</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Sure, it’s inevitable that those who are successful will be criticized. Someone’s song blows up, they get big, and then we get bored until they do something else remarkable. But in this corner of entertainment, it’s silly to dismiss a DJ because of their accolades. To paint a picture, a Berlin-based journalist I met recently told me (with a straight face) that because Gou is never seen in the local pubs in Berlin, it must mean she doesn’t actually live there (she does). So let’s set the record straight, aside from electronic music’s swirling pool of cool that has a habit of eating the principles it so vehemently defends, I can confirm that Gou is touring the world, looking sensational, and most importantly very, very good at her job. </p>



<p>To get a broader picture of how she shaped her taste, I ask Gou to name an album, movie and a book that was essential in her cultural education. For her movie she selects cult classic <em>Pulp Fiction</em> (which tracks with her style), the book is Nietzsche’s <em>Ubermensch </em>(there’s that critical thinking), and a true music head, she sites Kraftwerk’s <a href=""https://music.apple.com/us/album/3-d-the-catalogue-live/1572506374"">3-D: The Catalogue (Live) </a>as the ultimate education. Gou explains how she still tries to make it down to grassroots venues, “not just as a DJ but more importantly as a raver, which I always find inspiring and cathartic.” Her dedication to a range of culture shows in the sets she plays, so I think we can forgive her for not sharing a pint with us at the local boozer.</p>

<p>In March 2019, Gou realized she wanted to own her own music and uplift other artists on the rise, so she created <em>Gudu Records</em> and released her own album titled “Moment”. A few years ago, I interviewed the<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/matisa.dj/""> Italian DJ Matisa</a>, who has released music on Peggy Gou’s label. When I asked her about her experience as a woman in the industry, she credited Gou as a brilliant mentor to herself and others in the dance music community, adding that she’s very hard working and down to earth. I ask Gou about her mission to lift up other DJs like Matisa, and she stresses the importance of not only supporting new talent via <em>Gudu</em> but also including the newcomers on her line-ups IRL, “this is not just focused on the fact they’re women, they’re exceptionally talented and it’s important for me to use my platform to share that with the world”. </p>



<p>With rising costs for venues and AI music creation causing a stir, who knows where 2026 will take electronic music. I ask Gou if she’s optimistic about where the industry is heading, in terms of building a better future for those that follow her success and she leaves me with a gem of hope that mirrors the energy she brings to the industry: “I’m optimistic for sure, but as with anything growing as fast as our industry, it won’t be without its challenges.”<br /></p>

<p>Forget tortoiseshell, leopard, and cow prints for a second — deer print is about to steal their thunder. It’s also one of the easiest prints to recreate. Tiny, deliberate white spots stretch from base to tip on a brushed brown background, creating a deer-hide effect that perfectly nods to the winter season. We love this set by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRHqxjPjZwm/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Sierra, also known as @thatglosssauce</a> on Instagram.</p>

<p>It was only a matter of time before our iced coffee obsession made its way to our nails — and this look by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRcoHkmkXYV/?hl=en"">nail tech Elizabeth</a> is nothing short of incredible. It starts with a bronze cat-eye base, manipulated with magnets to achieve a glassy finish, followed by a matte top coat. Then, fine lines are painted on top using a glossy top coat to create a striking contrast effect.</p>

<p>Just hit the Explore page on Instagram, and it’ll become clear: baby blue and chocolate brown are the unexpected color combination of 2026 — and we’re here for it. There’s a ’70s retro vibe to the pairing, but it works effortlessly. Created by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DOB6k9NCF7E/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Heather Errington</a>, this pastel blue heart layered over a molten chocolate base is so cool.</p>

<p>Taking cues from A/W runways, plaid nails are everywhere, but velvet plaid — essentially plaid layered over a velvety cat-eye base — is what’s bringing the intricate pattern into 2026. Thanks to the mix of polish finishes, the effect is beautifully multidimensional. We love this icy <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRDATgRDhWq/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">look by @nailology.101</a>.</p>

<p>Hair artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tomsmithhd/?hl=en"">Tom Smith</a> describes the varsity bob as a choppy, chin-skimming cut with subtle layers and a center part. The inspo? <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stxph.h/?hl=en"">Steph Hui</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/milliebobbybrown/?hl=en"">Millie Bobby Brown</a>. “Polished but never prissy, it carries a cool collegiate energy — youthful without being childish and preppy without being stiff,” says Smith. While the movement might look undone, it’s actually intentional and well-maintained, adds Smith, thanks to the invisible layers through the mid-lengths and ends that create that flicky volume.</p>

<p>“Gucci bangs feel very fashion-forward — and powerful,” says celebrity hairstylist and colorist, Dimitris Giannetos. He recalls creating the softly-parted, slightly grown-out look for <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPCbqhRCcFf/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Demi Moore</a> ahead of her role as the fictional character Barbara Gucci in the short film <a href=""https://www.gucci.com/uk/en_gb/ms/short-film/video/?srsltid=AfmBOoqmlK5X6LGynFA07QzQ_cV-MEN9asH5aMoAgw1q-0w5QmEfs8ve""><em>The Tiger</em></a><em>.</em> “To achieve this look, ask for wispy curtain bangs just below the brows with face-framing pieces towards the ears,” recommends Giannetos. The key? “Avoid a blunt cut by adding some variety to the length of the bangs across the face,” he says.</p>

<p>“<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRwqKtLkWkX/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Anok Yai</a>’s striking short bob, complete with a blunt fringe, highlights the boldness of this style,” says celebrity hairdresser <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lorraine_dublin/?hl=en"">Lorraine Dublin</a>. “It’s a sharp, chin-skimming bob paired with a clean fringe, and it’s set to stand out this winter.” Why? It has a strong, modern silhouette, Dublin explains, yet still feels polished and low-maintenance.

The ripped bob, however, is a more interesting, layered take, thanks to softly separated ends created with a texturizing technique where the hair is chopped into vertically. This cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DFiwwTohOJ6/?hl=en"">Catherine Gibbs</a> is perfect.</p>

<p>The shag is set to take on a much gentler image in 2026, according to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/neale.rodger/?hl=en"">Neale Rodger</a>, style director at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stil.salon/reels/?hl=en"">STIL salon</a> in London. “Think soft, feathered layers that build volume and create easy movement,” says Rodger, like this look by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DQ8UfaOEZwa/?hl=en"">Ryenne Snow</a>. Rodger adds that it’s the kind of cut that still looks intentional even as it grows out. “It’s a brilliant choice for medium to thick hair,” continues Rodger, “especially if there’s already some natural wave or texture to play with.” Guiding your stylist is simple: “Ask for feathered layers throughout, soft ends, and a length that sits somewhere between the neck and shoulders,” advises Rodger.</p>

<p>The ’70s have had their time in the sun. Now, it’s 1960’s time to shine, and bangs are leading the resurgence, says <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/rickyandthe64/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ricky Walters</a>, founder and creative director of <a href=""https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/kDPwCAD7OkS1gz3BSGfnFGBjS0?domain=instagram.com"">Salon 64</a>. “The new incarnation is all about boldness: think thick, heavy, statement-making fringes taken surprisingly far back into the crown,” says Walters. He adds, “This isn’t a whisper of a fringe; it’s a full-volume curtain that instantly reshapes the face, adding drama, mystery, and a touch of French-girl rebellion.” Walters says that cutting it with plenty of density — adding bulk through techniques like point cutting and texturizing — prevents it from slipping into anything too dated. Hairstylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRgiqAzkYj5/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Ryenne Snow</a> always nails it.</p>

<p>The power pixie has <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DKC7SdkIV8j/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Florence Pugh</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/glennclose/?hl=en"">Glenn Close</a>, and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lirisaw/?hl=en"">Iris Law</a> to thank for its meteoric rise. “This is a cropped, layered pixie that’s sharp, sculpted, and deliberately androgynous,” says Smith. Its key characteristics? “Enough length and the top and front to allow for versatile styling,” adds Smith, who calls it the ultimate anti-blowout style. “This is great for finer hair types and those who want more lift, as it helps to contour the jawline and cheekbones when long enough to be tucked behind the ears,” says Smith. Asking for it couldn’t be simpler: “Ask for close layering and texture that can shift from matte and punkish by day to polished and glossy at night,” advises Smith — and don’t forget the longer, swooping bangs.</p>

<p>The name sounds complicated, but the result speaks for itself. It’s essentially a soft blowout with rounded, bouncy ends, explains Giannetos, who recently debuted the look on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPfNBxrAm_i/?img_index=1"">Amal Clooney</a>. “It works well on long, layered hair, about 6-8 inches from the shoulder. This look enhances body, adds movement, and makes the blowout feel thicker and more voluminous,” says Giannetos. “I like to take a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbioionic.com%2Fproducts%2Flong-barrel-curling-iron%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOop4ikEqvaTUTaxG4jDAYCjJnatn52afqSSXogJ4hCj1l_BzoThO"">1.25” Bio Ionic Curler</a> to the ends to lock in the rounded shape.”</p>

<p>Super-short styles are still trending, says Dublin, but the polished pixie is having a moment.

<p>The shaggy bob is not only effortlessly chic, says Dublin, but it’s practical for winter and spring. “The layers add movement and texture — great under scarves or hats — while still looking polished for work or evening plans,” adds Dublin. Grab a hydrating hair cream like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fpalo-santo-styling-cream-for-curly-coily-hair-P514454"">PATTERN by Tracee Ellis Ross Palo Santo Styling Cream</a> and let your natural texture do its thing.

<p>Mussed-up texture is in this season, says Stenson, and while the classic shag’s layering technique is making a comeback, it’s being reimagined for 2026 with modern softness and volume. “Even better, it’s flexible across hair types,” he adds. “A shag is great for anyone with thick hair because it removes weight and bulk. If you have finer hair, ask for a modern micro-shag or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/07/10604094/wolf-cut-hair-style"">wolf-shag</a> with strategic layering that adds volume and texture without making the hair look sparse,” advises Stenson.

<p>“The textured lob [aka long bob] will continue its quiet takeover,” says Rodger. “It’s mid-length, slightly undone, and effortlessly cool — the kind of cut that behaves beautifully through winter,” he adds. It’s also a seasonal all-rounder, and easy to air-dry in the warmer months, too. “I love how it slips under scarves and coats without losing shape, and it gives hair that natural, lived-in movement,” continues Rodger, who says it’s perfect for wavy and lightly curly hair. “Ask your stylist for a neck-to-shoulder graze with feathered, textured ends, and a soft, natural finish,” suggests Rodger.

<p>The 2026 update is lighter than its previous counterpart, says Walters, and it sits in what he refers to as the magic zone: “Just above the collarbone and never shorter than the jawline,” adds Walters, like this cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DL7RI9nTj3h/?img_index=1"">Miho Mai</a>. “This sweet spot creates a clean, graphic silhouette without sacrificing softness.” What gives it a modern edge is the invisible layering: “These are subtle, sliced-in shorter pieces hidden underneath,” says Walters. “These secret layers act like built-in movement, allowing the bob to swing, breathe, and catch the light in all the right ways.”</p>

<p>If they’re not cut properly, curtain bangs can look blocky and unnatural, failing to blend into the rest of your lengths. That’s why Stenson suggests asking for “texturized” curtain bangs. Texturized bangs are cut with techniques that soften the fringe and remove bulk, so they fall more naturally. “Your stylist will assess the density of your hair to ensure your bangs are proportionate to your face,” says Stenson. “Bangs are especially a great choice for those with fine or thin hair and looking to bring some volume to their look. They’re truly versatile enough to suit all face shapes.” Take inspiration from this cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DHXGOA8RxGH/?hl=en"">@charlottexstyles</a> on Instagram.</p>

<p>The bixie — bob meets pixie — is heading into 2026 with us, and for good reason: it’s soft, wearable, and short enough to feel fresh, says Rodger. “This is a sweet spot between a bob and a pixie, and it’s ideal for anyone tempted to go shorter without committing to a full pixie,” says Rodger. He adds that it works especially well on fine to medium hair, which always benefits from added texture through the mid-lengths and ends. “When you’re asking for it in the chair, think chin length or slightly above, with light, choppy layers and a soft, airy finish.” We love this crop by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DKmqHaSxsQ2/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Chellsie Aiger Serrano</a>.</p>

<p>Rodger is convinced that a “clean, blunt bob” is the answer to feeling polished without the effort, like this cut on STIL client <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DJcGcLqIu_E/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Abbie de Fontaine</a>. “The strong, even line gives you instant structure,” he says. “Plus, it looks incredible peeking out from under winter and spring layers.” He adds that the cut is particularly beautiful on slightly wavy or straight, finer hair, as it lends weight and sharpness. For the best result, Rodger suggests asking for a chin-to-collarbone bob with crisp, blunt ends and minimal layering. “Keep it sleek or lightly textured depending on your hair type,” he says.</p>

<p>Some things remain constant <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-nail-manicure-trends-2025"">every winter</a>: no matter how prepared you are, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-hand-cream-dry-skin"">your skin</a> will feel the brunt of the cold, you’ll almost always hate the sweaters you bought in last year’s sale with every intention of wearing them, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-cherry-perfume-fragrance"">the perfumes</a> that saw you through spring, summer, and fall just won’t feel right once the temperature drops.</p>



<p>Luckily, perfumers have been busy whipping up all manner of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/noyz-only-human-fragrance-review"">winter-appropriate fragrances</a> to suit every winter mood, whether you want to feel cozy, confident at parties, or refreshed on gloomy mornings. </p>



<p>Scroll ahead for the most inviting winter perfume trends and tips on how to wear them this chilly season — and beyond.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Soapy Oud</h2>



<p>There’s no mistaking the scent of oud — a dark, resinous wood. Equal parts sweet, earthy, and rich, it dominates any perfume it’s in, making it an acquired taste. Perfume expert Aamna Lone, aka <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/perfumeconnoisseurz/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">@perfumeconnoisseurz on Instagram</a>, predicts a new type of oud will reign supreme — and it’s easier to wear. “There has been a rise in soapy, sterile ouds that are softer but still allow the same projection,” she says. Think oud blended with clean-laundry notes like musk, heliotrope, and jasmine. She highlights <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmizensirparfums.com%2Fproducts%2Fperfect-oud%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOor9AQrJPJMckF7nxC4tEEjVkgpI3t8MCwunQtiPgFhRkSpJZfdR"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mizensir’s Perfect Oud Eau de Parfum</a>, which features a “metallic, crisp texture.” Then there’s the more affordable <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Romancea-Woman-Parfum-Ard-Zaafaran/dp/B07QY42V1H"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Oud Romancea</a>, which, to Lone, smells like literal soap and oud. </p>

<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Dark Fruits</h2>



<p>Lee Howes, <a href=""https://www.lush.com/us/en_us"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lush’s fragrance category lead</a>, says we usually associate fruity scents with summer, but this winter it’s time for darker, richer, berry-like fragrances, inspired by the winter harvest, to take the spotlight. “Cherry will stay popular, though in a cozier form,” says Howes. “This season, we have our <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Fcherryish-body-spray%3FqueryId%3Db1255e9fb5d1463e8c5a9f7b571da05b"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cherryish Body Spray,</a> which keeps the freshness of cherry but warms it up with notes of chocolate marzipan — it’s a really festive scent.”</p>



<p>Also try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neimanmarcus.com%2Fp%2Fbalmain-beauty-balmain-cuir-elysees-edp-50-prod284410126"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Balmain Cuir Élysées Eau de Parfum</a>, which blends raspberry with moody leather and enveloping sandalwood. If berries aren’t your thing, consider <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fjo-malone-sandalwood-spiced-apricot-cologne%2F8558395%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOoraoEdGbW_5g9CjthQuB_RAWQYbSCQ5JIh4cnkd3OBbzQUVD6pM"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jo Malone Sandalwood &amp; Spiced Apricot Cologne</a>, which pairs an otherwise summery fruit with rich, dark cardamom.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Edible Nostalgia</h2>



<p>Gourmand fragrances — perfumes with sweet, birthday cake-like notes — aren’t going anywhere, but they’re getting more complex, says <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/barbstegemann/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Barb Stegemann</a>, founder and president of <a href=""https://the7virtues.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqi7ycJdxA7P5-RVi6XV6otELvTHJ93U6Eh0jmSlG_4VhEFG6Fb"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The 7 Virtues</a>. “The future is all about creating a layer-cake effect, stacking notes of vanilla, caramel, fruit, buttercream, and berries so you smell like no one else in the room,” she says. Gourmand scents can sometimes feel a little saccharine and juvenile, but they also evoke nostalgia, Stegemann notes. To make them more glamorous, she says we’ll pair these sweet notes with deeper ones for contrast. “Think santal wood, tonka bean, and musks,” she explains, calling this the next evolution of personalization. “You’re literally baking your own scent — a fragrance that feels custom, modern, delicious, and uniquely yours.”</p>



<p>Try layering <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fcherry-ambition-eau-de-parfum-P508411"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The 7 Virtues Cherry Ambition</a> (cherry, plum, vanilla marshmallow) with <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP518376"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kayali Freedom Musk Latte Eau de Parfum</a> (latte, chocolate musk, and cinnamon).

<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Perfume Priming</h2>



<p>Lone highlights a burgeoning trend among the internet’s perfume enthusiasts: layering fragrances with traditional balms. “This could be Tiger Balm, Aboniki [a Nigerian muscle relief balm made from menthol and eucalyptus oil], or even Vicks VapoRub,” says Lone — yes, really.</p>



<p>“The <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@a.dose.of.e/photo/7561922146411236630"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Aboniki layering combination</a> was popularized by certified fragrance specialist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/a.dose.of.e/"">Eudora Nwasike</a>, and it has gone viral ever since,” she adds. The main advantage of layering perfume over a balm like this is that it serves multiple purposes. “You can decongest stuffy noses, help ailing joints, and smell good for longer because it creates a new fragrance profile,” says Lone. Even better? “The balm helps ‘trap’ the fragrance odorants in its emollient base, so the scent bubble sticks around for longer.”</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Seasonal Gourmands</h2>



<p>Howes makes another case for gourmand scents but says they’ll be getting a seasonal makeover this winter. “Vanilla and tonka notes have dominated fragrance for months, but now, expect to see them blended with deeper, more nuanced materials,” says Howes. He suggests watching for ginger, black pepper, and cardamom for what he calls spicier takes on the typical sweet scents. “Also, try more grounding and comforting notes of sandalwood and coffee,” recommends Howes. “From Lush, our big winter scents tend to be the deep coziness of <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Flord-of-misrule-perfume"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lord of Misrule Perfume</a> and our soft, powdery gourmand, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Fturmeric-latte-perfume%3FqueryId%3D0f15fb59b12d096e60db0e759aee4b5c"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Turmeric Latte Perfume</a>,” he adds. “Both do a brilliant job of wrapping you up in beautiful fragrance as the weather takes a chillier turn.”</p>

So crave-worthy, Stegemann says this “foodie fragrance” sold out in 48 hours in more than 60 Sephora stores and immediately became the number two fragrance on <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fbrand%2F7-virtues"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sephora.com</a>. </p>

<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Strawberry Chypre</h2>



<p>Lone pinpoints “strawberry chypre” as the next big thing in fragrance. For the uninitiated, chypre is a fragrance family that blends bright citrus notes with earthier tones like wood and spices. The addition of strawberry adds a sweet touch, making it more wearable for everyday. “This has sprung forward thanks to <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP517175"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miu Miu Miutine</a> (strawberry, bourbon vanilla, moss, and amber), and it mirrors iconic past favorites such as <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP12495"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chanel Coco Mademoiselle Eau de Parfum</a> and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP474316"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miss Dior Cherie Eau de Parfum</a>,” says Lone. </p>

Lone predicts that this perfect pairing will continue trending well into next year.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Scented Skin Layering</h2>



<p>“In many (decidedly warmer) parts of the world, it’s popular to wear scent in the form of a body powder to keep skin feeling fresher for longer — all while smelling great,” says Howes, adding that it’s a smart way to create a “scented base layer.” Think of it as the fragrance equivalent of a clean cotton T-shirt. </p>



<p>Dusting powders are a new Lush innovation, and they’re about to be huge. “These soften and scent your skin, blending beautifully with whatever fragrance you decide to spray on top,” says Howes. Happily, some of the brand’s most popular fragrances are now available in powder form: <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Fsticky-dates-dusting-powder%3FqueryId%3Dc3fc6cfd1d1903f50a8a0d7c1ea6c806"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sticky Dates</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Flet-the-good-times-roll-dusting-powder%3FqueryId%3Da8b035ed56610abfa60655706286e71c"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Let The Good Times Roll</a>, and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Fsuper-milk-dusting-powder%3FqueryId%3D3c8842b45d0044e97ea24073690bbb7d"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Super Milk</a>. “You can even layer these with your favorite body spray,” recommends Howes.</p>

<p>Sometimes when we least expect <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-are-5-love-languages-meaning"">it, love appears</a>. Venus in Capricorn is going to bring a lot of rizz to our hearts, allowing us to elevate our romantic game. The last week of December 2025 and first week of January 2026 are going to be filled with tenderness in its purest and deepest form; the planets aren’t fooling around when it comes to committing. Rather than playing games, we’ll be inclined to be direct and honest with what we require in partnerships. So, ramp up your profile on the dating apps, clear the cache, and get hyper-specific about what you’re looking for, because things are about to get interesting in the midst <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cuffing-season-relationship-experiences"">of cuffing season</a>.</p>



<p>Typically, the transit of Venus and Capricorn allows us to take a mature approach to romantic relationships. We state our intentions in the beginning to ensure that we’re on the same page with others. There are no hidden agendas or shadiness when it comes to what we’re giving and pulling in, meaning that our agenda is clear: we want to be a part of a union and take steps towards advancing it in the simplest ways without any drama. Building a life together, with our crush/boo, with structure and shared goals, is essential. We are willing to combine resources to create a strong foundation that can’t be broken.</p>



<p>When it <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/making-friends-connections-adulthood"">comes to friendships</a>, we will not settle for the company of those who treat us unjustly and unkindly. Having people around us who respect and honor our time, as well as our qualities, is important. After all, we don’t want to give our energy to those who aren’t going to reciprocate fairly, which is another core theme of Venus in Capricorn. The earthiness of this aspect makes us feel super connected to our besties. Keep in mind that the focus is on material things, so we may desire shopping sprees, wine tastings, spa days, or decadent meals with our crew instead of hanging out at the local pub or coffee house.</p>



<p>From December 24, 2025, to January 17, 2026, Venus in Capricorn is making us believe in our visions of devotion. The presence of Neptune in Pisces adds a softer vibe, allowing us to fall head over heels. Luckily, Saturn gives us the strength not to go overboard. The caveat is that boundaries will be instrumental in how we move forward with others. If you get the opportunity to peek through your significant other’s iCal, resist the urge. If you opt to be nosy and get caught, it might cause major rifts. </p>



<p>On the other end of the spectrum, the first of two Venus Star Points occurs on January 6, 2026 (the last one is cosmically slated for October 23, 2026. The term is coined by astrologer Arielle Guttman, who considers the meeting of the Sun and Venus in the same sign and degree (also known as “cazimi”) to bring about metamorphic changes. Venus becomes an evening star, making it hard to spot in the sky, but not in our spirit. Since this celestial union is in Capricorn, we are inclined to make pragmatic decisions about whom we commit. Get ready to adjust your relationship status on social media! </p>



<p>As a result, Venus in Capricorn pushes us to put the effort into our passions to ensure they become tangible and true. Roll up your sleeves and start working to get what you deserve when it comes to cultivating relationships. It’ll be worth the time and energy in the end. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951226.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Welcome to a major transition week, R29 babes. On December 21st, the solstice strikes and Capricorn Season officially begins, marking one of the most powerful energetic pivots of the year. In astrology, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">solstices are threshold moments</a>: they represent extremes of light and dark, visibility and invisibility, action and rest. This one ushers us into four weeks of self-dedication, sovereignty, and intentional effort. And because <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars is already in Capricorn</a> as the sun changes signs, we haven’t entered this energy cold.</p>



<p>We’ve been acclimating to discipline, devotion, and long-term thinking for weeks now. What shifts at the solstice is not effort, but <em>orientation</em>: we move from Sagittarius’s freedom-seeking, exploratory energy into Capricorn’s grounded commitment to self, legacy, and responsibility. We’re also coming off the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-new-moon-in-sagittarius-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Sagittarius New Moon</a>, making this an ideal week to set intentions if you haven’t yet, or to recommit to the ones that truly matter.</p>



<p>Before the sun even enters Capricorn, though, there’s an important emotional undercurrent. In the early hours of December 21st at 5:08 a.m. EST, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, creating a moment of tension between sensitivity and action. Jupiter in Cancer amplifies emotional truth, memory, and the need for safety, while Chiron in Aries exposes wounds around identity, courage, and self-assertion.</p>



<p>Collectively, this can feel like wanting to protect ourselves while also being asked totake bold steps forward. Old insecurities may flare up, especially around whether we’re  allowed to take up space or move decisively while still honoring our feelings. The entry into Capricorn Season acts as a grounding balm after this square, reminding us that we don’t have to choose between emotional honesty and forward momentum. We can build from both.</p>



<p>As the week unfolds, the Capricorn influence deepens. On December 24th, Venus enters Capricorn, joining the sun and Mars and bringing seriousness to our relationships — romantic, platonic, and professional. Even during the holidays, the collective mood is less about small talk and more about substance. We’re thinking about money, security, generational wealth, and what (or who) is actually worth investing in. Standards are higher, patience is thinner, and performative connection won’t cut it. This is a powerful moment to turn that discernment inward first. How can you live according to the standards you expect from others? How can you embody the stability, integrity, and commitment you’re craving? Capricorn Season isn’t about deprivation — it’s about self-respect. And this solstice week sets the tone.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831490.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> begins with a potent internal–external tension. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your career, reputation, and long-term goals light up, asking you to take yourself seriously and step more fully into leadership. But just before that shift, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in your sign, bringing emotional material to the surface, especially around home, family, and your inner child. You may feel pulled between ambition and vulnerability, between showing up powerfully in the world and tending to old wounds that want your attention. This can be an uncomfortable but clarifying start to the week. The message is clear: true authority comes from emotional honesty. When you acknowledge where you still need care, you actually become more grounded and effective in your public life.</p>



<p>As the week continues, the focus sharpens. On December 24th, Venus enters Capricorn, joining the sun and Mars and intensifying themes around professional relationships, long-term commitments, and the value you bring to the table. The second half of the week asks you to evaluate where your time, energy, and talents are going, and whether they’re being reciprocated in meaningful ways. This isn’t about chasing validation; it’s about alignment. You may feel less patient with superficial interactions and more drawn to connections that support your growth and legacy. Capricorn energy here reminds you that success isn’t just about achievement… it’s about building something you can stand behind with pride.</p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, the solstice ushers in Capricorn season and activates your sector of higher learning, belief systems, and long-term vision, inviting you to zoom out and consider where you’re headed next. But this week doesn’t begin in purely practical territory. Just before the sun enters Capricorn, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, stirring emotional material in your subconscious and healing sector. Old fears, unspoken worries, or patterns you’ve kept buried may surface, especially around trusting yourself to move forward without having everything figured out. This square can feel disorienting, but it’s also liberating. You’re being asked to release limiting beliefs that have quietly shaped your decisions and to make room for a more compassionate inner narrative as you step into the next chapter.</p>



<p>As the week unfolds, Venus, your ruling planet, enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and bringing clarity to what you want to commit to long-term. The second half of the week favors intentional planning, meaningful conversations about the future, and decisions that support growth beyond your comfort zone. You may feel drawn to travel plans, educational pursuits, or spiritual practices that offer both structure and inspiration. Rather than rushing, Capricorn energy encourages you to build your expansion thoughtfully. This is about choosing paths that feel both grounding and expansive — ones that honor your values while helping you grow beyond what’s familiar.</p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, cosmic beings, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> begins with emotional depth and psychological insight. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your focus shifts to intimacy, shared resources, trust, and energetic exchange. But before that grounding takes hold, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, activating tensions between your friendships, future goals, and deeper emotional wounds around belonging. You may notice sensitivities around who truly supports you, who drains you, and where you’ve overextended yourself socially or emotionally. This square can surface discomfort, but it’s also clarifying. It asks you to get honest about reciprocity, and to release group dynamics or obligations that no longer feel aligned as you prepare for a more intentional chapter.</p>



<p>As the week unfolds, Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and deepening your desire for emotional and financial integrity. The second half of the week favors serious conversations around shared money, long-term commitments, or emotional boundaries. You may feel less inclined toward surface-level connection and more focused on building trust that’s earned, not assumed. Capricorn energy here supports mature intimacy — the kind that feels stabilizing rather than consuming. This solstice week reminds you that when your inner world is supported, your outer brilliance flows more freely.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> places relationships at the center of your attention. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your partnership sector is activated, bringing focus to commitment, collaboration, and emotional balance with others. Just before that shift, Jupiter in your sign squares Chiron in Aries, highlighting tension between your personal growth and professional or public-facing wounds. You may feel torn between honoring your emotional needs and showing up confidently in the world. Old insecurities around visibility or leadership could resurface, but they do so in order to be healed. This square asks you to trust that caring for yourself doesn’t weaken your ambition… it strengthens it.</p>



<p>As the week continues, Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and adding seriousness to your relationships. The second half of the week encourages you to assess which connections feel mutual, stable, and aligned with your long-term goals. You may feel less interested in keeping the peace at all costs and more committed to partnerships that offer real support. This is a powerful moment to redefine what commitment means to you: choosing relationships that feel grounding, respectful, and capable of growing with you.</p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> begins with a call to recalibrate your energy and priorities. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your focus shifts to work, health, routines, and the systems that hold your daily life together. But before that grounding fully settles in, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, activating emotional material tied to rest, burnout, faith, and old beliefs about always having to be “on.” You may feel the tension between wanting to push forward and realizing your body or spirit needs more care. This is a powerful moment to listen to subtle signals — fatigue, irritation, or restlessness are all messages asking you to work <em>with</em> yourself, not against yourself.</p>



<p>As the week progresses, Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and bringing harmony and intentionality to your daily life. The second half of the week is ideal for refining habits, improving work dynamics, and committing to routines that support your long-term vitality. This isn’t about restriction… it’s about self-respect. You may feel more motivated to clean up your schedule, set clearer boundaries at work, or invest in practices that make you feel stronger and more capable. This solstice week reminds you that sustainable success starts with taking care of the engine that powers it all: you.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> activates themes of joy, creativity, and emotional honesty. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your sector of pleasure, romance, and self-expression comes into focus, inviting you to take what you love seriously. But just before that grounding energy settles in, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, surfacing deeper feelings around vulnerability, trust, and shared emotional or financial investments. You may notice where you’ve been over-giving, overthinking, or holding back out of fear of losing control. This square can stir discomfort, but it also offers healing clarity, especially around intimacy and what you truly need to feel safe opening your heart.</p>



<p>As the week continues, Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and bringing warmth, devotion, and maturity to matters of love and creativity. The second half of the week favors meaningful connection over casual interaction. Whether romantic or artistic, you’re drawn toward experiences that feel grounded, intentional, and worth investing in. This is a powerful time to commit to a passion project, deepen a relationship, or simply allow yourself to enjoy what you’ve worked so hard to build. The solstice reminds you that joy doesn’t have to be earned… it can be chosen.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> is giving “I said I was fine, but the body kept the receipts.” As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your focus turns inward to home, family, and emotional foundations. You’re craving comfort, stability, and maybe even a little nesting energy. But just before that grounding arrives, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, poking at the tension between your public image and your closest relationships. Translation: you might be killing it at work or showing up polished on the outside, while privately feeling misunderstood, under-supported, or low-key exhausted by certain dynamics. This could look like smiling through a family dinner you’d rather skip, or realizing you’ve been people-pleasing your way into burnout. The solstice asks you to be honest about where you actually need support instead of pretending you’ve got it all handled.</p>



<p>By midweek, the vibe shifts from emotional awareness to practical action. On December 24th, Venus, your ruling planet, enters Capricorn, joining the sun and Mars and turning your attention to what stability really looks like. The second half of the week is perfect for setting boundaries at home, having the “okay but how are we <em>actually</em> doing?” conversation, or making decisions that support your long-term peace, even if they’re not immediately popular. This is Capricorn energy with receipts: choosing rest over obligation, quality over quantity, and emotional safety over aesthetics. The glow-up here is subtle but powerful. You’re learning that balance isn’t about keeping everyone happy… it’s about creating a life that doesn’t drain you.</p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> is delivering truths with zero fluff and no emotional cushioning. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your mind shifts into strategist mode. Communication, scheduling, boundaries, and logistics suddenly matter a lot more. But before you can fully enjoy the clarity, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, stirring tension between your big-picture beliefs and the daily grind that’s been quietly wearing you down. You may realize you’ve been philosophizing your way around a very real problem, like saying “it’ll work out” instead of actually fixing your schedule, your habits, or your burnout. The solstice doesn’t judge you for this. It just hands you the clipboard and asks you to be honest.</p>



<p>Then, because the universe loves divine timing, Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and upgrading your communication style from “intuitive and intense” to “clear, intentional, and impossible to misinterpret.” The second half of the week favors direct conversations, firm decisions, and cutting through emotional static. You’re less interested in explaining yourself and more interested in results. Think fewer dramatic monologues, more bullet points. This is a powerful moment to say what you mean, mean what you say, and stop entertaining dynamics that require you to over-function. Capricorn energy doesn’t ask you to be nicer — it asks you to be effective.</p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> is giving “freedom, but make it fiscally responsible.” As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your focus shifts to money, self-worth, and what you actually have to show for all those big ideas. But before you can fully lean into the budgeting era, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, stirring emotional stuff around shared resources, trust, and independence. You may notice a low-grade irritation about having to rely on someone else, or realizing you’ve been way too chill about an arrangement that deserves more structure. The solstice doesn’t cancel your optimism; it just asks you to back it up with a plan.</p>



<p>By the second half of the week, the tone sharpens. Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and making it clear that your time, energy, and talents are not a charity. You’re more selective about how you spend your money and who gets access to you. This could look like saying no to last-minute plans, renegotiating financial terms, or finally admitting that “exposure” is not a currency. Capricorn energy here isn’t about being boring, it’s about valuing yourself enough to build something sustainable. The real freedom comes from knowing you’re not winging it anymore.</p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the solstice marks your official reset, and you feel it immediately. As the sun enters your sign on December 21st, the focus shifts back to <em>you</em>: your body, your boundaries, your identity, your direction. But before that clarity fully lands, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, bringing up emotional tension between your public role and your private foundation. You may feel pulled between responsibility and vulnerability, between being “the strong one” and needing support yourself. Old family patterns or inner-child wounds could surface, not to derail you, but to remind you that leadership doesn’t mean emotional self-denial. This solstice asks you to define success in a way that includes your well-being, not just your output.</p>



<p>As the week continues, your presence sharpens. On December 24th, Venus enters your sign, joining the sun and Mars and adding magnetism, maturity, and seriousness to how you show up and what you attract. People notice you more now, but not because you’re performing. It’s because you’re embodied. The second half of the week is ideal for recommitting to yourself, refining your goals, and setting the tone for the year ahead. You may feel less interested in explaining yourself and more interested in alignment. The shadow here is over-identifying with productivity or carrying responsibility that isn’t yours. The power move? Choosing yourself without guilt. Capricorn Season doesn’t ask you to do more… it asks you to do what matters.</p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> is giving “main character energy, but with emotional accountability.” As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, you slip into a quieter, more behind-the-scenes mode. This activates your rest, reflection, and subconscious sector, which already feels ironic given how visible your thoughts usually are. But before you can fully retreat, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, highlighting tension between your daily responsibilities and how you communicate your needs. You might realize you’ve been intellectually explaining your feelings instead of actually <em>feeling</em> them. Or pushing through exhaustion because “it’s fine.” The solstice gently (but firmly) calls that bluff.</p>



<p>Then, because the universe loves a slow burn, Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and reinforcing the message: rest is not optional, and boundaries are not rude. The second half of the week favors solitude with purpose: tying up loose ends, clearing emotional clutter, and quietly deciding what you’re no longer available for in 2026. This isn’t isolation; it’s preparation. Capricorn energy here asks you to stop leaking energy in places that don’t return it. You’re not disappearing…you’re conserving power. And honestly? That’s very on brand for the upgrade ahead.</p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> is quietly calling you out, in a loving, no-nonsense way. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your focus shifts to friends, community, and long-term goals. But before that clarity fully lands, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, activating tension between joy, creativity, romance, and your relationship with money or self-worth. Translation: you might want to do what feels good, but there’s a voice reminding you that vibes alone don’t pay bills or sustain dreams. You could feel emotionally exposed around what you deserve versus what you’ve been settling for. The solstice doesn’t shame you for dreaming… it simply asks whether you’re willing to support those dreams with structure.</p>



<p>Then the tone firms up. Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and bringing seriousness to your social life. The second half of the week is about discernment: who’s actually aligned with your future, and who’s just along for the ride? You may feel less available for emotional freeloading and more interested in connections that show up consistently. Capricorn energy here helps you mature your compassion, keeping your heart open without overextending yourself. You’re learning that boundaries don’t make you colder; they make your magic sustainable. And honestly? That’s the ultimate end-of-year glow up.</p>
